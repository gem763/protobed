Trump is already screaming about a \u201ccoup,\u201d trying to turn Americans against the impeachment process; the rebuttal to that from the left is that if they were going to stage a coup, it sure as heck wouldn\u2019t end with Mike Pence as president, which is what\u2019ll happen if their impeachment effort succeeds. Start talking about *Pence* being impeached and removed too, though, and suddenly the \u201ccoup\u201d argument becomes more tenable. Democrats are trying to get rid of both Republicans in order to make Nancy Pelosi president. Any small, tentative support Dems currently enjoy among moderate Republicans would go up in smoke if that perception took hold. And of course Senate Republicans would never, ever allow it. In some worst-case scenario where both Trump and Pence were impeached, they\u2019d find a reason not to remove Pence in the name of maintaining Republican control of the White House.\n\nBut as I say, Democrats can\u2019t say \u201cIt\u2019s Trump we hate, it\u2019s Trump we\u2019re after, and so we\u2019re giving Mike Pence a completely free pass for political reasons, to reassure Republican voters that they\u2019ll still rule the executive branch.\u201d Instead they\u2019ll be forced to concoct excuses for the VP when the media coughs up stories like this:\n\n[T]he president used Pence to tell Zelensky that U.S. aid was still being withheld while demanding more aggressive action on corruption, officials said. At that time \u2014 following Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenksy \u2014 the Ukrainians probably understood action on corruption to include the investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Officials close to Pence insist that he was unaware of Trump\u2019s efforts to press Zelensky for damaging information about Biden and his son, who had served on the board of an obscure Ukrainian gas company, when his father was overseeing U.S. policy on Ukraine. Pence\u2019s activities occurred amid several indications of the president\u2019s hidden agenda. Among them were the abrupt removal of the U.S. ambassador to Kiev; the visible efforts by the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to insert himself in the U.S.-Ukraine relationship; as well as alarms being raised inside the White House even before the emergence of an extraordinary whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s conduct. Perhaps most significantly, one of Pence\u2019s top advisers [national security advisor Keith Kellogg] was on the July 25 call and the vice president should have had access to the transcript within hours, officials said.\n\nTrump had also told Pence earlier in the year not to attend Zelensky\u2019s inauguration. And WaPo\u2019s White House sources claim that Pence \u201cprobably\u201d would have had the notes of Trump\u2019s famous phone call with Zelensky in his briefing book when he traveled to Poland to meet the Ukrainian president in September. Between those notes and Kellogg\u2019s personal awareness of what was said on the call (supposedly Kellogg didn\u2019t see the call \u201cas unusual or flag any concerns about it to the vice president\u201d) and the inauguration cancellation and the mysterious hold-up in military aid and the other things mentioned in the excerpt, Democrats could argue that Pence should have realized \u2014 and probably did realize \u2014 what was going on when Trump sent him to Warsaw and had him press Zelensky on unspecified \u201ccorruption.\u201d It was a pressure campaign, with a very particular result in mind.\n\nBut they\u2019re not going to argue that. Maybe some of their 2020 candidates will try to drag Pence into it as a way of virtue-signaling to the left that they\u2019re ready to impeach anyone and everyone in the Trump administration, but party leaders will seize any excuse available to ignore Pence\u2019s role in this. \u201cI can believe that Mike Pence was so disengaged from what his own government is doing that he failed to recognize what was going on under his nose.\u201d Or \u201cAs much as I dislike Mike Pence, I think we need to focus on the mastermind here.\u201d Or even some meritorious excuses \u2014 \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure Pence was in on it since he never specifically mentioned Biden to Zelensky.\u201d Or \u201cI blame Keith Kellogg, who was on the call, instead of Pence for not bringing the call to Pence\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nWorst-case scenario for Pence here, realistically, is that the impeachment push somehow gains momentum and Democrats end up censuring him in the House. Imagine how annoyed Pelosi must be, though, to see the friendly confines of MSNBC raising this uncomfortable question for her at a moment when she\u2019s trying to convince the public that Trump \u2014 and only Trump \u2014 must go.", "description": "Heh.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/t-4.jpg"}
