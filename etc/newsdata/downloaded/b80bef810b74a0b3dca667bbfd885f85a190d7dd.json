Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a \u2026\n\n\u2026 concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know \u2014 it was always you, through your proxies and \u2026\n\n\u2026 powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose.\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies.
