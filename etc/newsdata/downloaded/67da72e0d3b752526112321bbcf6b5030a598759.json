It makes clear that information gathered by the six committees that have been conducting oversight into Trump would funnel to the House Judiciary Committee \u2013 the panel that has traditionally been charged with impeachment.\n\n\"None of us came to Congress to impeach a president \u2013 but each of us took a solemn oath to protect and defend the Constitution,\" McGovern said. \"While the president and his allies try to obstruct our investigation and cover up his wrongdoing, the House will continue to do its job and uncover the truth for the American people.\"\n\nThe Thursday vote on the resolution will mark the first time House members will be forced to vote on the inquiry after weeks of intense criticism by the GOP and put several moderate Democrats and Republicans under close scrutiny as the 2020 election approaches.\n\nWar of words:: 'Everybody has read your words on the call': Pelosi responds to Trump tweets on impeachment\n\nThe rules appear tailored to meet complaints that Republicans have made for weeks about closed-door depositions that three key committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 have been holding with witnesses from the State Department and national security offices. Republicans argued that Democrats were holding secret impeachment hearings in the basement of the Capitol.\n\nBut it wasn't enough to appease concerns and Republicans in leadership urged their colleagues to vote against the measure. GOP lawmakers argued the resolution did not include additional resources for conservative lawmakers leading the committees where impeachment would take place and failed to detail whether the president and his attorneys could be present for the hearings, offer evidence or cross-examine witnesses.\n\nThe White House denounced the measure in a statement by Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, saying the resolution continues the impeachment \"scam\" without allowing \"any due process for the President.\"\n\n\"The White House is barred from participating at all, until after Chairman Schiff conducts two rounds of one-sided hearings to generate a biased report for the Judiciary Committee,\" she said. \"Even then, the White House's rights remain undefined, unclear, and uncertain \u2013 because those rules still haven\u2019t been written.\"\n\nLater on Tuesday, Democrats released a three-page summary that outlined the role of the president and his counsel once impeachment moves to the Judiciary Committee. It includes that both the president and his counsel may cross-examine witnesses, offer evidence and craft a closing presentation.\n\nBut it all comes with a caveat \u2014 all requests would have to be approved by Democrats and would be rejected should the administration block witnesses or documents from being made available.\n\nThe resolution broadly outlines the plan for public hearings to take place in the House Intelligence Committee, which has led the investigation into Trump asking Ukraine to investigate political rivals \u2013 the central focus of the impeachment investigation.\n\nBoth Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. and Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the committee, would have subpoena power and be given up to 90 minutes together to question witnesses during public hearings \u2013 or have staffers ask questions.\n\nBut subpoenas from Nunes, R-Calif., would first have to be approved by Schiff, who can reject such requests. Any rejection could be brought to the full committee for a vote, the resolution notes.\n\nThe measure also directs the Intelligence Committee to craft a report on its findings and offer it to the House Judiciary Committee, which under the resolution would also offer subpoena power to both parties on the panel \u2013 Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican.\n\nMore: More than 80% of Republicans say seeking foreign help in elections is not OK, poll finds", "description": "The House released a resolution Tuesday outlining the next phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, offering Republicans subpoena power as hearings move into public view.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ssho6szMzITFqBdUtfu42w--~B/aD0yNTE3O3c9MzcxMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/d4501efd67b10cd02c2da4de59c2dbec", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
