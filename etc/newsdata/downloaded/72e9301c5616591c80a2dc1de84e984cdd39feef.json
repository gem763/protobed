REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThe Pentagon said on Wednesday it would pull funding from 127 Defense Department projects abroad and at home, including schools and daycare centers for military families, as it diverts $3.6 billion to pay for President Donald Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S. border.\n\nTrump has made immigration a signature issue of his presidency. He declared a national emergency over the issue earlier this year in an effort to redirect funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S. southern border, which he originally said would be paid for by Mexico.\n\n\u201cThe message that I\u2019ve been carrying, since when I was acting secretary to today, has been about the increase in burden sharing,\u201d Esper told reporters in London late on Thursday.\n\n\u201cSo part of the message will be \u2018Look, if you\u2019re really concerned then maybe you should look to cover those projects for us\u2019 because that\u2019s going to build infrastructure in many cases in their countries,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPart of the message is burden sharing, \u2018Maybe pick up that tab.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome of the projects affected are in Europe, like $21.6 million for port operation facilities in Spain and $59 million for munitions storage in Slovakia.\n\nThe defunded projects also include schools for the children of military personnel in Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe fund diversion has been heavily criticized by U.S. lawmakers, who say it puts national security at risk and circumvents Congress.\n\nEsper will meet his British and French counterparts in the coming days.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly called on NATO countries to pay at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product for defense.\n\nThe Pentagon has been increasing its attention toward Europe in recent years, concerned about a resurgent Russia.\n\nEarlier this week Vice President Mike Pence said allies should \u201cremain vigilant\u201d about Moscow\u2019s election meddling and work toward independence from Russian energy supplies.", "description": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that European nations should consider funding projects in their countries after the Pentagon diverted money to pay for a border wall with Mexico.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426696668&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8426N", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
