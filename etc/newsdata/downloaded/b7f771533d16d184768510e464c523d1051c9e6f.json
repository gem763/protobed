Taylor said President Trump himself made the release of military aid to Ukraine contingent on a public declaration by Ukraine\u2019s president that the country would investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and the 2016 election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn an instant, the impeachment inquiry no longer rested on the credibility or motives of a whistleblower, nor arguments about the meaning of quid pro quo. Here, spelling out Trump\u2019s wrongdoing in extensive detail, was the diplomat Trump\u2019s team brought out of retirement to be the ambassador to Ukraine \u2014 replacing the woman Trump ousted from that position at the request of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Taylor, an Army veteran and a respected diplomat who obviously kept detailed notes, will not be easy to discredit.\n\nTrump, more than anybody, must have known how damaging Taylor\u2019s testimony would be. Ninety minutes before Taylor was slated to arrive, Trump created a diversion. He tweeted to his 66 million followers: \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching.\u201d\n\nIt was a grotesque provocation, clearly aimed at fomenting racial division \u2014 and it worked, for a bit. Reporters momentarily stopped asking about Taylor and started asking about lynching. Democrats reacted with outrage. And Trump\u2019s boosters in the House defended him. \u201cThis,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) concurred, \u201cis a lynching in every sense.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut ultimately no amount of distraction could counter what was happening in HVC-304, three floors beneath ground level in a secure room in the Capitol Visitor Center. As the day wore on, and reports of the deposition leaked out, there was a palpable change above ground.\n\nWhen Senate Republican leaders gave their weekly news conference after lunch, Fox News\u2019s Chad Pergram observed that Republicans \u201ccriticize the process and don\u2019t defend the president outright.\u201d Pergram asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) directly: \u201cAre you willing to defend the president in this matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to talk about the process,\u201d McConnell replied.\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell also said Trump\u2019s \u201clynching\u201d claim \u201cwas an unfortunate choice of words.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s claim that McConnell told Trump the call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cinnocent,\u201d McConnell contradicted Trump: \u201cWe\u2019ve not had any conversations on that subject.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell isn\u2019t yet where Republican Sen. Howard Baker was during Watergate when he asked: \u201cWhat did the president know and when did he know it?\u201d Republican support for Trump has not yet crumbled.\n\nBut now Trump\u2019s handpicked ambassador, with specific and detailed allegations but no obvious anti-Trump motive, has blown up the many denials offered by the president. With growing evidence of Trump\u2019s wrongdoing, and Trump\u2019s aberrant behavior (\u201clynching\u201d!) in response, Republicans continued to cling to the last plausible defense: Complaining about the \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfair process,\u201d Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), a Trump loyalist, said as Taylor testified.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), another Trump defender, stood nearby and said how \u201cunfair the process is.\u201d\n\nTwo of the nine Republicans on the intelligence committee skipped Taylor\u2019s early testimony, instead joining a news conference with GOP leaders to complain some more about the process.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUnfair and unprecedented process,\u201d protested Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.).\n\n\u201cAn unbelievable abuse of process,\u201d Rep. Mike Turner (Ohio) added.\n\n\u201cA mockery of the process,\u201d contributed Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair in the process,\u201d chimed in Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.).\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey have concocted a process in secret,\u201d GOP caucus leader Liz Cheney (Wyo.) lamented.\n\nCombined, the leaders complained about the \u201cprocess\u201d 31 times \u2014 but uttered the names \u201cTaylor\u201d and \u201cUkraine\u201d not once.\n\nNow, Republicans object to the impeachment depositions being taken behind closed doors, even though Republicans did much the same in the past. But will they really be happier when proceedings become public? How can they defend a man publicly implicated by his own subordinates?\n\nYou might call it a work in \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Republicans object to the impeachment depositions being taken behind closed doors.
