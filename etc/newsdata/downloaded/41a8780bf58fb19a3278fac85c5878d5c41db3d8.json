So was Howie Kendrick, 36, the second baseman who earned NLCS MVP honors with four doubles and four RBIs in the sweep. And Ryan Zimmerman, 35, the first baseman slugging .484 this postseason.\n\n\u201cA lot of old guys on the team,\u201d Rendon observed. \u201cThey call themselves \u2018Viejos.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, they do, and \u201cLos Viejos\u201d - Spanish for \u201cThe Old Guys\u201d - are a big part of why the Nationals are getting ready to face the Astros in the Fall Classic, which opens Tuesday night in Houston.\n\nThere\u2019s also catcher Kurt Suzuki, 36, and reliever Fernando Rodney, 42, the oldest active player in the majors.\n\n\u201cPeople think we are old men and we can\u2019t do things,\u201d said Rodney, who credited Suzuki with originating the nickname. \u201cSo we say, \u2018Vamos, Viejos! You can do it!\u2019\u201d\n\nThey helped make Washington the oldest club in baseball in 2019, with an average age of a tad under 31.\n\nThe Astros aren\u2019t exactly spring chickens, either: With an average age of just above 30, they ranked third oldest out of the sport\u2019s 30 clubs. Just like the Nationals, their roster includes a half-dozen players who are at least 35, including rotation stalwarts Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke.\n\n\u201cOlder players sometimes get devalued a little bit, just because of the age,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cYou can call us old, but that\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t care. We feel like we can still contribute and we can still play at a high level. And I think that\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d\n\nScherzer, for example, is a three-time Cy Young Award winner who followed up yet another stellar regular season by compiling a 1.80 ERA in four appearances in the playoffs; Washington went 4-0 in those games.\n\nS\u00e1nchez has made two starts this postseason with a 0.71 ERA.\n\nLike Scherzer and S\u00e1nchez , Rodney is one of a half-dozen members of the Nationals to already have appeared in a World Series (only one, little-used reliever Hunter Strickland, has won a title).\n\nRodney\u2019s been a key part of the late-season rebirth of the team\u2019s bullpen: He\u2019s allowed two hits and zero runs in 2 2/3 innings in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI look at them, and they\u2019re not old to me,\u201d 55-year-old manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing like I\u2019ve seen them play when they were 27, 28.\u201d\n\nSure, the Nationals do have a couple of kids playing key roles in starting outfielders Juan Soto, 20, and Victor Robles, 22. But there\u2019s not much else at that end of the spectrum, which is why when second baseman Brian Dozier, who\u2019s 32, was asked what advice he\u2019s giving the younger guys, he chuckled and responded: \u201cYounger guys? You mean the two that\u2019s in here?\u201d\n\nDozier thinks it\u2019s important to have a lot of veterans at this time of year - players who have been around are used to dealing with distractions such as an increased media presence and have a better grasp of how to, as he put it, \u201cslow the game down a lot more\u201d when the pressure increases.\n\n\u201cThe chemistry and the experience that veteran guys bring, you can\u2019t put that into an algorithm. You can\u2019t put a money value on it. So people don\u2019t like it. But there\u2019s definitely a place for those guys,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a team filled with old guys, either. Nobody\u2019s saying that. I\u2019m just saying that there are spots on every team for veteran guys who have been there and done that and have experience and can teach the young, talented guys that are basically going to carry the game on to the next generation how to respect the game, how to play the game the right way.\u201d\n\nNationals GM Mike Rizzo likes the way the older players mentor the younger ones.\n\nHe also likes the production \u201cLos Viejos\u201d provide.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were the oldest team in the league, and everybody said that\u2019s a negative. We just tried to flip that and made it a positive, because we know how good \u2026 we can still play. All of us, even the old guys,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cFor me, I don\u2019t even feel old. I feel young. I feel great and know that I can go out there and do everything I could do back when I was 25 years old.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum and AP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "NL MVP candidate Anthony Rendon surveyed his teammates scattered around the Nationals Park diamond, whoopin' it up after clinching a World Series berth.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/nlcs_cardinals_nationals_baseball_43477_c0-199-4759-2975_s1200x700.jpg?ffbe32c3d31e384f0e9d0a3a54e059af61d3264f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
