Evans from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) told The Independent.\n\n\u201cI had a hunch it was bad but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this dramatic,\u201d he added.\n\nScientists looked at the 549 million hectares of intact tropical forests in the world between 2000 and 2013, during which time 48 million hectares was destroyed. The three main blocks are in the Amazon, Congo basin and in the island of New Guinea.\n\nIntact forests refer to areas free from significant human pressure. Only 20 per cent of tropical forests are \u201cintact\u201d but they store 40 per cent of carbon found in all tropical forests.\n\nOne thing researchers looked at was the edge effect: When forests are fragmented, more trees become exposed to the edge where there is less protection from strong winds, drought, invasive species and fires from neighbouring farmland.\n\nThese \"edges\" can be hundreds of metres wide and are significantly less healthy than areas further in.\n\n\u201cA bunch of pressures diffuse in through the edges. That is well understood to reduce the amount of carbon the forest can hold and eventually you end up with only three-quarters of the carbon you had before,\u201d said Dr Evans.\n\nAnother significant pressure is the loss of wildlife from hunting.\n\n\u201cLots of carbon-rich tree species depend animals for seed dispersal \u2013 they have big seeds so they need big animals to disperse them,\u201d said Dr Evans. \u201cHowever, hunters specifically take big animals and in fragmented areas, populations of elephants, tapirs, toucans and monkeys all get hunted out.\u201d\n\nThis results in a loss of large trees which means less carbon can be held under the canopy.\n\nThe last key pressure the study looked at was selective logging which is when high value wood is removed from a forest without the area being deforested.\n\nOnce tracks have been made people go in to take out cheaper wood and eventually \u2013 when the path is well trodden \u2013 people take out low-value trees to use as firewood or charcoal.\n\nScientists did their study by looking at maps showing changes in the world\u2019s forests, reviewing literature about these changes and examining the carbon impact it had.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A devastating drought made Balkisa\u2019s harvests fail, made food prices soar, and then forced her family apart. Her husband migrated in search of work to earn money to provide for his young family, leaving her heavily pregnant and alone. \u201cSometimes if my husband had money he sent it to me so I could eat. Sometimes the money just doesn\u2019t come,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to give birth.\u201d But seven-month-old twins Hassan and Ousseni are lucky, they were born the night after Red Cross support came to Tombokiery village, Niger. The Niger Red Cross provided the family with a small cash grant. \u201cA Niger Red Cross volunteer told me to go first because she saw how exhausted I was. I used the money to buy food, then I went back home to sleep feeling relieved.

In the Sahel rainfall has become erratic and wet seasons that people rely on are shrinking. The Sahel has one of the driest climates in the world, people who live here have always been incredibly resilient, are now having to adapt and survive to ever harsher conditions. The region is almost one degree hotter than in 1970 and could rise by several degrees by the end of the century.

Dr Evans said \"90 per per cent of this information was in the public domain but was never put together properly.\u201d\n\nLead researcher Sean Maxwell of WCS and the University of Queensland said: \u201cOur results revealed that continued destruction of intact tropical forests is a ticking time bomb for carbon emissions. There is an urgent need to safeguard these landscapes because they play an indispensable role in stabilizing the climate.\u201d\n\nThis study is the latest to show emissions need to be rapidly reduced globally if climate goals are going to be reached.\n\n\u201cOur research reveals that additional sources of carbon emissions are currently not being accounted for by national governments, because they\u2019re not legally required to consider them,\u201d said co-author Dr Alexandra Morel from the Zoological Society of London.\n\n\u201cMonitoring of these intact forests over the last decade has shown an acceleration in their loss, which would suggest that without more attention this unaccounted source of emissions will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations runs a programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) which enables developing countries to receive financial incentives for enhancing carbon stocks.\n\nREDD+ covers support for conservation of forests not under immediate threat.
