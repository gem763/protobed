So who is Gordon Sondland and how did an otherwise middle-of-the-road Republican take a plush job in Europe and turn it into a starring role as hatchet man for a scheme that threatens to unravel the Trump presidency?\n\nWelcome to Rabbit Hole.\n\nThe Donald\u2019s favor: During Sondland\u2019s nomination hearing, the word \u201cUkraine\u201d never even came up. He testified about the importance of \u201ctrade, security, the migrant crisis, Brexit, and the disposition of the [Iran nuclear deal]\u201d as the foremost challenges facing the EU, fielded a few questions on Russia and trade, and sailed through to nomination with bipartisan support.", "description": "In any normal administration, Gordon Sondland\u2019s tenure as ambassador to the EU might have been unremarkable.
