Amazon is widely seen as a front-runner because of its experience handling classified data for the CIA. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nThe Defense Department\u2019s statement did not say which company Esper\u2019s son works for, how that information about the contract came to the secretary\u2019s attention or why he did not recuse himself earlier.\n\nAn IBM spokeswoman told The Post that Esper\u2019s son, Luke, \u201chas been a digital strategy consultant with IBM Services since February. His role is unrelated to IBM\u2019s pursuit of JEDI.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a LinkedIn profile that appears to belong to Luke Esper, which identifies him as a digital strategy consultant at IBM, the younger Esper started working at the company in February. Mark Esper was confirmed months later, in July.\n\n\u201cThis will probably fall on deaf ears, but do not attempt to reach out to me for a request for comment etc. etc. regarding anything having to do with my father,\u201d stated a post on the profile late Tuesday. \u201cHe has, and always will, have my full support in anything he does. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt is the latest conflict-of-interest issue related to the JEDI contract, which seeks to centralize the military\u2019s computing infrastructure in the hands of a tech company, allowing U.S. military agencies to harness the most advanced innovations Silicon Valley has to offer.\n\nAD\n\nDefense officials had expected to select a winner for the sought-after contract earlier this year but paused the procurement to investigate potential conflicts of interest involving Deap Ubhi, a former defense official who joined Amazon soon after contributing to the procurement as a Defense Department employee. The Pentagon\u2019s investigation determined that Ubhi had misled the Pentagon and Amazon regarding the terms of his departure but also determined that his role did not create an organizational conflict of interest in Amazon\u2019s favor.\n\nUbhi was one of four individuals who were the subject of a long-running lawsuit brought by Oracle, which has sought to unravel the JEDI procurement.\n\nAD\n\nThen in late September, the White House asked Esper to review the contract after President Trump expressed concerns that the award would go to Amazon. The contract has been held up while Esper has been reviewing the approach.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s intervention became the subject of an investigation by the Defense Department inspector general after members of Congress expressed concerns.\n\nDana Deasy, overseeing the procurement as Defense Department chief information officer, has emphasized that Esper\u2019s review of the strategy for JEDI is separate from the source selection process that is evaluating bids from Amazon and Microsoft. He has also said that the award would wait until after Esper\u2019s review, as well as the inspector general\u2019s investigation.\n\nHoffman emphasized Tuesday that the procurement \u201cwill continue to move to selection through the normal acquisition process run by career acquisition professionals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEsper, a former Army officer who became a Raytheon lobbyist and then Army secretary, faced tough questions over his own business interests during his confirmation hearing, when Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said his relationship with Raytheon \u201csmacks of corruption.\u201d\n\nIn his answer, Esper pushed back on the idea that those who are hired through revolving-door arrangements are necessarily corrupt.\n\n\u201cI went to war for this country. I served overseas for this country. I stepped down from jobs that paid me well more than I was working anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd each time, it was to serve the public good and the young men and women of our armed forces. So, no. I think for some reason the presumption is that anyone who comes from the business or corporate world is corrupt.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSoon after the project was publicly announced last year, a group of companies that then included Microsoft, Oracle and IBM launched a highly public lobbying campaign seeking to pressure the Pentagon into breaking JEDI out into more than one contract.\n\nAD\n\nThey argued that the Defense Department was following an approach that is out of line with how the most advanced companies handle cloud computing and said such a strategy risks the cybersecurity of classified information by placing too much data in the hands of one company.\n\n\u201cGiven what DOD is trying to do with this cloud \u2014 a single award, and lock-in for 10 years \u2014 [picking just one provider] is completely contrary to their objectives,\u201d Sam Gordy, head of IBM\u2019s federal business, said in an interview last year. \u201cThis DOD cloud award is completely contrary to what the [Trump] administration has been saying as far as cloud smart.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIBM brought a bid protest with the Government Accountability Office seeking to block the award. It was later dismissed when Oracle sued in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n\nAmazon has been alone among the bidders in favoring the single-award strategy, arguing such an approach will allow the Defense Department to move faster with its limited technology workforce.\n\nAlice Crites and Jay Greene contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Esper\u2019s son is employed with one of the contract\u2019s bidders.
