Most of The Five (others eventually attended the meetings as well) lived in Ostermalm, central Stockholm\u2019s fashionable new eastern district that was developed at the turn of the 20th century. From about 1898 to 1918, Hilma lived with her mother at Brahegatan 52. Anna Cassel, another member of The Five who became the artist\u2019s lifelong friend and occasional financial support lived at Engelbrektsgatan 31. Though a few modern buildings likely dot each block of the district, pilgrims will still find the ambience of the streets much as Hilma likely did \u2014 with charming cafes, taverns and shops on street level, and tidy rows of apartment windows above.\n\nErik af Klint and his family lived at Karlavagen 56, the family home on one of the district\u2019s broader avenues, where his son Johan recalls his great-aunt\u2019s paintings were stored, rolled up in boxes in an unheated attic for more than 20 years. Miraculously, they emerged in virtually impeccable condition.\n\nDespite having rejected an outright bequest of Hilma\u2019s legacy, the Moderna Muse et has been instrumental in conserving the collection and has recently committed to maintaining her presence in its galleries.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a separate gallery or a shrine to her that is isolated from everyone else,\u201d Fredrik Liew, the curator of Swedish and Nordic art, said, \u201cbecause our museum exists to put things into context.\u201d\n\nOn view through most of 2020 is a selection of notebooks from 1902 to 1905 by The Five, including automatic drawings created as a group, as well as individual drawings by Hilma. These are shown along with other Swedish artist collectives from the period, particularly through the lens of feminism in a gallery titled \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d in homage to Virginia Woolf. A nearby display, \u201cSpheres of Abstraction,\u201d places af Klint\u2019s larger paintings with other artists of the period who turned to abstraction to represent not just spiritual or utopian ideals but also to express the sometimes frenetic movement and pace of modern cities.", "description": "In and around Stockholm, the secretive painter \u2014 whose bold abstract works predated Kandinsky\u2019s \u2014 lived a life of spiritual yearning that shaped her artistic career.", "authors": ["Andrew Ferren"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/travel/21stockholm-af-klint5-promo/21stockholm-af-klint5-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
