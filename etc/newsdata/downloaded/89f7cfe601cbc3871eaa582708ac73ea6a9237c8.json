The orders were adopted in 2016, after being pushed as a means of temporarily taking guns away from dangerous people. The confiscatory period was one year when the orders first became law, but the Associated Press reports that Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed a bill Friday that allows the confiscatory period to expand to five years.\n\nMoreover, the bill signed by Newsom allows \u201cemployers, co-workers and teachers to seek gun violence restraining orders against other people.\u201d Gun Violence Restraining Orders originally only allowed family members to seek confiscatory orders against an individual.\n\nThe lengthening of the confiscatory period and the broadening of those who can seek is at least the third expansion of California\u2019s Red Flag Law in as many years.\n\nFor example, in late 2018, California Democrat lawmakers complained that not enough family members were availing themselves of the confiscatory law. On September 19, 2018, the Los Angeles Times reported that Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer wanted a public campaign to encourage more people to pursue such orders against family members.\n\nDemocrat lawmakers responded to Feuer and others by putting forward changes making it easier to get an order to confiscate guns from an individual. On September 29, 2018, Reuters reported that Gov. Brown signed the changes.\n\nOn January 1, 2019, changes took effect that broadened California\u2019s confiscatory law so as to include ammunition and certain magazines. KRCR reported that the changes \u201c[add] ammunition and bullet drums to the list of items related to firearms that can be confiscated.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
