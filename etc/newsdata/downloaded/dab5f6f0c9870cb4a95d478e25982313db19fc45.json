Mr. Kerkhoff, the former finance chief, became CEO in July 2018, ending a monthslong hiatus after his predecessor left under pressure from investors.\n\nMr. Kerkhoff's first, bold initiative -- a plan to split the company into two businesses -- was abandoned after the European competition watchdog blocked a planned European steel joint venture with India's Tata Steel Ltd.\n\nRecently, a deteriorating economic environment has added to Thyssenkrupp's homegrown problems. The company, which issued four profit warnings under Mr. Kerkhoff's short tenure, has been hit by slowing demand from car makers, higher raw material prices and rising uncertainty caused by international trade conflicts.\n\nSome directors thought Mr. Kerkhoff was moving too slowly, according to people close to the board. Mr. Kerkhoff announced plans to shed nearly 4% of the staff and nearly halve administrative costs in May last year, when the company issued its third profit warning.\n\nSome board members also disagreed with Mr. Kerkhoff's decision to only sell a minority stake in the elevator business after the company had considered a full or partial divestment or an initial public offering, these people said.\n\nTrade union IG Metall said the sudden departure of Mr. Kerkhoff had created more unease among employees already troubled by the uncertainty over planned asset sales.\n\nThyssenkrupp said the planned overhaul would be \"systematically continued.\"\n\nThe Krupp foundation, representing heirs to the company's founders with a roughly 21% stake, and Cevian Capital, which holds about 18%, said they fully supported Ms. Merz. A trained mechanical engineer, Ms. Merz spent 17 years at auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH and has overseen restructuring as a board member of Swedish car maker Volvo AB.\n\n\"We expect that the new leadership will speed up the transformation process that Thyssenkrupp so urgently needs, and improve the quality of implementation,\" said Lars F\u00f6rberg, founding partner of Cevian Capital.\n\nShares in Thyssenkrupp fell about 1.5% Wednesday and were down about 18% so far this year. This resulted in the company's ousting from Germany's blue-chip DAX index earlier this month.\n\nWrite to Ruth Bender at Ruth.Bender@wsj.com and Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 25, 2019 09:10 ET (13:10 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
