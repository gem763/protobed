But we are predicting better times for the sector ahead,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nThe third leg is infrastructure spending, which Lowe said is \u201cnot only supporting demand in the economy at a time when this is needed, but it is also adding to the supply capacity of the economy and directly improving people\u2019s lives\u201d.\n\nThere are two risks to the rosier picture.\n\nFirstly, household consumption - which remained completely flat in the last 12 months - remains hostage to a combination of low income growth and the weakness in the housing market, where a 20-year low in people moving house has seen softness in spending on new furniture and household appliances. Without a pick up in wages, Lowe conceded that the case for a sustained pick-up in household spending is hard to make.\n\nThe second risk is the international uncertainties created by trade tensions, Brexit, the problems in Hong Kong and developments in the Middle East.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is these uncertainties, Lowe said, that are weighing so heavily on global rates. And in an \u201cinterconnected world\u201d the RBA has little choice but to \u201ctake the world and global interest rates as we find them\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur floating exchange rate gives us a degree of monetary independence, but we can\u2019t ignore structural shifts in global interest rates. If we did seek to ignore these shifts, our exchange rate would appreciate, which, in the current environment, would be unhelpful in terms of achieving both the inflation target and full employment.\u201d\n\nLowe repeated his view that an extended period of low rates may be needed to \u201cmake further progress towards full employment, and achieve the inflation target over time\u201d and the board is ready to cut again if it needs to.\n\nThe question, as always, is when. There\u2019s certainly an argument to be had that by forecasting a gentle inflection point in the domestic economy, Lowe is signalling that he can afford to wait just a little longer before cutting again \u2013 even in an interconnected world.", "description": "Philip Lowe says the global downward pressure on rates can't be ignored.
