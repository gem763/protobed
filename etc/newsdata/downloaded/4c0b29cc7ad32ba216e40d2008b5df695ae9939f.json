The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.46% fell 6.8 basis points to 2.130%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nInvestors dived into government bonds following soft economic data that put the spotlight on the eurozone\u2019s economic doldrums. The flash eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to an 83-month low of 45.6 in September, down from 47 in August.\n\nExport powerhouse Germany saw its composite gauge, combining manufacturing and services activity, fall to 49.1. Any reading below 50 reflects a contraction in economy activity and often coincides with the onset of recessions.\n\nAnalysts say chances of a recession in the largest economy in the eurozone is rising, after it shrunk in the second-quarter of 2019.\n\nThe 10-year German government bond yield TMBMKDE-10Y, -12.15% plunged 6.2 basis points to negative 0.58%.\n\nSee: Eurozone manufacturing PMI drops in September to worst level in nearly 7 years\n\nWhat did market participants\u2019 say?\n\n\u201cAll the figures missed their forecasts, but standing out was the German composite index, which fell below 50 for the first time in six years, indicating that the euro area\u2019s largest economy is now in contraction,\u201d wrote Marios Hadjikyriacos, an investment analyst at XM.\n\n\u201cConsidering that Germany already contracted in Q2, today\u2019s numbers effectively increase the risk of another negative quarter in Q3, which by definition would constitute a technical recession. It seems that the malaise in manufacturing \u2013 owed to trade and Brexit worries \u2013 has started to spread to the much larger services sector as well,\u201d wrote Hadjikyriacos.", "description": "U.S. Treasury yields fall sharply on Monday after a raft of eurozone economic data underlines shrinking manufacturing activity across the economic bloc.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
