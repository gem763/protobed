One, of course, was Jack Nicklaus's total of 18 majors. The other was Sam Snead's all-time record of 82 victories on the PGA Tour.\n\nAfter making progress towards the former for the first time in 11 seasons with his 15th major success at the Masters in April, Woods - playing in his first tournament for nine weeks following a fifth bout of surgery on his left knee - signed off this remarkable comeback year by moving alongside Snead with a three-stroke success in the rain affected Zozo Championship, the first PGA Tour event to be staged in Japan.\n\nSnead achieved his 82nd in 1965 at the age of 52. Even after all his injuries, Woods has matched the feat at 43, and will surely now go on to achieve a total that will last at least as long as the one set by the man known as Slammin' Sam.\n\nTiger Woods holds aloft the trophy at the Zozo Championship in Inzai on Monday\n\nWoods has pulled level with Sam Snead after winning his 82nd PGA Tour title in Japan\n\nTiger, who began the tournament with three straight bogeys, defeated a stellar leaderboard, with Japanese superstar Hideki Matsuyama his nearest pursuer, followed by Rory McIlroy in third place. Woods had just seven holes to complete when play resumed this morning at 6-30am just outside Tokyo, but that didn't stop thousands of spectators from getting up early to accompany him on his latest march into history.\n\nThere was a moment of alarm when his three-shot lead was instantly reduced with a bogey at the 12th. Furthermore, Matsuyama had a chance to reduce the deficit still further with a 6ft birdie attempt at the 14tt - but that slipped by, and would prove as close as he got. A Tiger birdie on the same hole meant he could play smart rather than aggressive golf from there to the clubhouse to close out yet another win, this time by three strokes.\n\nWoods looked like himself of old as he surged to victory in the Zozo Championship in Inzai\n\nWoods' latest triumph puts him level with Sam Snead's total of 82 PGA tour wins\n\nWoods pictured as a young boy getting Snead's autograph while sipping on a coke\n\nTiger's next task will be to put on his captain's hat for the Presidents Cup and name his four wildcards next week. He's now certain to expend one of them on himself for the match against Ernie Els's International team at Royal Melbourne in December.\n\nWoods said: 'This is big. Hideki made it tight. It was a lot closer than people maybe thought. It is just crazy. It is a lot.\n\n'I have been able to be consistent most of my career and have put myself up there with a chance to win on a number of occasions, there was plenty of times I didn't but today was one of those days where I was able to pull it out.\n\n'It was definitely stressful.'\n\nWoods, who struggled badly after his incredible win at the Masters in April until his recent knee surgery, revealed that he had been badly struggling with his putting before the procedure, and credited the operation with sparking his return to the winner's circle.\n\n'Having the knee procedure allowed me to start putting good again,' he told Golf TV. 'It\u2019s the simple things like being able to get down and read a putt. I really didn\u2019t do much of it last year, I didn\u2019t squat, end up kneeling down from up high, lining my ball up instead of squatting and lining up my line. Little things like that, and eventually I didn\u2019t rotate round the golf ball, put more strain on my back, that was getting worse so I had to manage that.\n\n'In hindsight, I probably should have done the procedure like I planned last year after the Hero (World Challenge), but who knows, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have won the Masters. All in all, I would have much preferred to win the Masters.'\n\nJapan's very own Hideki Matsuyama pushed Woods close on the final day, but fell just short\n\nWoods also spoke of his experiences with Snead, from when he first met 'The Slammer' as a child to their later time spent together at events, such as the Masters' champions dinner.\n\n'The only time I got a chance to play with Sam Snead was over a couple of holes where he had an outing and I was two down through two!' he said.\n\n'He came out and watched me play at my first LA Open so that was kind of trippy, coming off the 10th green and there was the great Sam Snead standing right there. I\u2019m 16 years old and I end up piping one right down the middle of the fairway so that felt pretty good.\n\n'Fast forward to having spent the dinners with him over the years, to hear the needling, the jabbing, the good times that we had, then to ultimately tie his record, it\u2019s very special.'\n\nThe scoreboard says it all as Woods holds aloft the trophy before the all-important number\n\nMeanwhile, at the Portugal Masters, Englishman Steven Brown was left lost for words following a remarkable first tour success. The 32 year old began the week in a precarious position with regard to retaining his European Tour privileges for next season. Now he has bade farewell to fretting about the forthcoming qualifying school and preparing to say hello to the glittering world of the mega-bucks play-offs, beginning next week with the \u00a37million Turkish Airlines Open.\n\nTalk about four days that changed everything.\n\nHow does a man play so badly for virtually the entire season and then find his form when nothing else will do? Even going into the last day, Brown knew he still had work to do, despite being in a healthy fourth place. He needed a top three finish.\n\nUp against two South Africans in Brandon Stone and Justin Walters, let's hope the man from Middlesex set the tone for this momentous sporting week between the two nations with his nerveless play. Brown finished with a marvellous 66 for a one-stroke triumph over the pair.\n\n'It's hard to put into words,' he said. 'It just shows that you never know with this game. It's crazy to think how well I played here and in France last week (he finished 11th) and how badly I played for so much of the season. I never thought this would happen. I was counting down to qualifying school and getting ready for that.'", "description": "When he turned professional in 1996, Tiger Woods had two landmarks in mind. One was Jack Nicklaus' 18 majors.
