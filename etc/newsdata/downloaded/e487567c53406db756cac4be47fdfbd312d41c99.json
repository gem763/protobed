Of course, there's a catch. The beer (or, as Kirin puts it, \"beer-taste beverage\") doesn't have any alcohol, which is responsible for much of the calorie content of normal beer.\n\nIt also contains \"bitter acid\" derived from fermented beer hop extract, which, in spite of its name, doesn't actually impart any noticeable bitterness or acidity to the beer but has the remarkable effect of reducing abdominal fat. Through ten years of research and development, Kirin scientists finally succeeded in mass-producing it.\n\nTo test the slimming effect of Kirin Karada Free, they conducted a test in which 200 men and women with BMIs between 25 and 30 drank one can a day for 12 weeks or a placebo. Those who drank Kirin Karada Free achieved a reduction in their total abdominal fat between 7-8 square centimeters greater than those who didn't.\n\nAnd not only is it free of alcohol, it has hardly any calories (5 per 100 ml), and scarcely any sugar (under 0.5 grams) or purine bodies (under 0.5 milligrams) either.\n\nPhoto: grape Japan | \u00a9 Kirin Holdings Co\n\nWhat it hasn't removed is a satisfying beer taste. We had a sample and were pleasantly surprised. Of course, it's not the same as an alcoholic brew, but it's one of the best-tasting non-alcoholic beers we've tried. It has the unmistakable aroma of beer and a refreshing taste which goes down smoothly!\n\nFor more information on Kirin Karada Free, visit their website here.\n\nSource: Kirin Holdings Co.\n\nRead more stories from grape Japan here.\n\n-- Kyoto Yakitori Restaurant \u201cKazu\u201d Gets Michelin\u2019s Coveted \u2018Bib Gourmand\u2019 Rating\n\n-- Japan\u2019s Iconic Creepy Arcade \u201cAnata no Warehouse\u201d Is Closing\n\n-- Starbucks Japan Unmasks New Dark Night Masquerade Frappuccinos\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://grapee.jp/en/\n\n\u00a9 grape Japan", "description": "Science may not have invented a perpetual motion machine yet, but Japanese beer maker Kirin may just have accomplished the next best thing: a beer which actually reduces your beer belly.
