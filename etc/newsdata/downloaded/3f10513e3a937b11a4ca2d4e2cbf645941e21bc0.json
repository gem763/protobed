REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBarty lost the opening set in the pair\u2019s first-ever meeting but conceded just three games in the remaining two sets in Shenzhen to seal a win guaranteeing that she will end the year as the WTA\u2019s top-ranked player, as well as putting her on top of the Red Group in the competition\u2019s round robin format.\n\nShe is joined by Japan\u2019s Naomi Osaka, who defeated Petra Kvitova in three sets in a rematch of their Australian Open final earlier in the season.\n\n\u201cI think it was a pretty high-quality match and it\u2019s a difficult court to get rhythm on at times, so it\u2019s important to try and neutralize when you can and that was the biggest key in the second and third sets,\u201d said Barty.\n\nBencic took the first set by breaking the Australian in the penultimate game as Barty sent her forehand long from behind the baseline.\n\nBarty responded in style, however, reeling off five straight games to take control of the second set as Bencic struggled with a heel injury.\n\nThe world no. 7 returned after a medical time-out to win the opening game of the final set but Barty was soon in control again, securing a break in the third game that allowed her to cruise to victory.\n\nEarlier in the evening, Osaka claimed her first-ever win at the WTA Finals with a 7-6 4-6 6-4 victory over Kvitova in the pair\u2019s opening match.\n\nThe Japanese right-hander lost all three of her matches on her debut at the tournament last year and she made a slow start against the Czech star, who broke in the first game before holding her own serve to love to take a 2-0 lead in the opening set.\n\nBut three double faults from Kvitova allowed Osaka to break back in the eighth game and the 2018 US Open champion eventually took the opening set in a tie break, conceding a solitary point.\n\nKvitova won a see-saw second set, securing three breaks to Osaka\u2019s two, to move the match into a third but the 23-year-old held firm to pick up an opening victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really one that plays that well in the first round,\u201d said Osaka. \u201cIt was very difficult for me to play against her at first but I tried to fight no matter what and I\u2019m very glad that I was able to win.\u201d", "description": "World number one Ashleigh Barty battled back against Switzerland's Belinda Bencic to make a winning start to the 2019 WTA Finals on Sunday as the Australian notched up a 5-7 6-1 6-2 victory.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445535898&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0JF-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
