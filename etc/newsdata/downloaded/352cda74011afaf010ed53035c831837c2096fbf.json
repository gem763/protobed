What are their rights?", "language": "en", "text": "When thousands of travelers around the world found themselves stranded Monday after Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest tour operator, went belly up, it was just the latest example of a travel company\u2019s collapse leaving consumers scrambling. Wow Air failed in March, Primera Air went out of business a year ago and Monarch Airlines collapsed a year before that.\n\nAnd while the British government was organizing a massive effort to help its citizens find their way home after the Thomas Cook bankruptcy, all business failures are not created equal.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the world is a patchwork of laws and regulations when it comes to travel,\u201d Kyle Valenta, executive editor at travel review site Oyster.com, said in an email. \u201cEurope is generally governed by more strident laws that have sought to protect the travel consumer.\u201d\n\n\n\nBritish tourist Charles Lawrie and son Charlie wait for information at Dalaman Airport in Turkey on Monday after Thomas Cook collapsed. (Umit Bektas/Reuters)\n\nValenta said that travelers who book a package tour in the United Kingdom, like the kind of trips Thomas Cook specialized in, are probably covered by an Air Travel Organizer\u2019s License, or ATOL. He described it as \u201cessentially a government-run travel insurance fund.\u201d That protection, run by the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority, keeps consumers from losing money or getting stranded overseas if the company they booked a package with goes out of business.\n\n[After Thomas Cook collapse, U.K. launches largest peacetime repatriation operation]\n\nThere are similar measures in place throughout the European Union, according to Christian Nielsen, chief legal officer of AirHelp.\n\n\u201cThey will cover your expenses and make sure you get home if you are traveling,\u201d Nielsen says.\n\nValenta said the United States has far fewer protections in place: \u201cTravelers whose flights are canceled are due a refund, according to the Department of Transportation, but that\u2019s about the extent of it.\u201d There are no provisions for the type of effort underway in the U.K. now\n\n\n\nPassengers queue at the closed Thomas Cook check-in desk at the international airport in Cancun, Mexico, on Monday.

He said in an email that that benefit \u201ccan reimburse a traveler for their prepaid and nonrefundable trip costs if their travel provider ceases operations for financial reasons.\"\n\n[Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse leaves hundreds of thousands of travelers stranded]\n\nJeffrey Miller, a travel industry lawyer and professor at Florida Atlantic University, said he tells his students the first day of class to always book travel with a credit card instead of a debit card. Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, he said, consumers who buy airfare with a credit card are entitled to a refund if their flight is canceled because of bankruptcy or any other reason. Debit cards do not carry the same protection.\n\n\n\nA sign informing customers the branch has closed hangs in the door of a Thomas Cook travel agency store in Orpington, U.K., on Monday. (Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News)\n\n\u201cThe airline itself, if that\u2019s on a credit card, it\u2019s refundable,\u201d he said. But the protection doesn\u2019t extend to other parts of a vacation, such as a hotel the traveler can\u2019t get to.\n\nNielsen said some credit cards also come with travel insurance built in, but travelers would need to check the fine print.\n\nAccording to him, one option not even worth pursuing is attempting to recoup expenses from the company itself that goes out of business.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never see a dime from the airline that goes bankrupt,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically what\u2019s called a simple creditor; you would be the last in the line of creditors. When everyone in front of you has taken what\u2019s theirs, there\u2019ll be nothing left.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHere\u2019s what an airline could owe you for ruining a trip\n\nTurns out, misbehaving on a plane could cost you big money\n\nRecent incident over attire highlights the ambiguity in airline dress codes", "description": "The answers vary around the globe, but they're all fairly bleak.", "authors": ["Hannah Sampson", "Reporter Focusing On Travel News", "September At Pm", "Hannah Sampson Is A Staff Writer At The Washington Post For The Way", "Where She Reports On Travel News."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qZj4a2YSotBKzCKlSPNemgW_I0I=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K462U2FV5NBLFJJTOQOKGFFEYI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
