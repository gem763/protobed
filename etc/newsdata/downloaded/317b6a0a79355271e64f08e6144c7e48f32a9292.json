A video of a toddler dancing and leading a gym class for adults is going viral. The little baby girl can be seen jumping, stretching, and turning around, in the video, and all the women follow her lead. The little girl also keeps turning around as if to make sure that everyone is indeed following her moves.\n\nIn the video the women and the baby are stretching to 'Me Too' by Meghan Trainor. People in the comments section cannot get over the adorable baby, well truth be told, we cannot either.\n\nTheir fitness instructor is very short. pic.twitter.com/Rn5dJlLZbq \u2014 jamie (@gnuman1979) October 18, 2019\n\nAnother video went viral last week. In that, a man can be seen dancing with a stray dog with no care in the world. It has to be one of the purest things on the Internet - Just a man, entertaining a dog who seems mildly amused; the person probably didn\u2019t even know that his moves were being captured on a CCTV.\n\nReportedly the video is from Turkey, and the man in the clip is Metin Can \u015eener, who was on his way back home when he saw the dog on the street. The dog eagerly trotted towards the man, its tail wagging, which is probably a sign that they knew each other.\n\nDon't Miss 160 SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\n\nSokak k\u00f6pe\u011fi g\u00f6r\u00fcnce severken kafay\u0131 yiyorum :( pic.twitter.com/7de40imwej \u2014 II. Supermet (@bendemistims) October 12, 2019\n\nThe man then broke into some killer moves, it looks more like he is entertaining the dog than dancing WITH it. The dog keeps wagging its tail, as can be seen in the video, and even though it does not break into any crazy dance moves, it is clearly interested in the dancing man and doesn\u2019t want him to stop. The man pets the dog occasionally and one can\u2019t really say that the pooch minds.\n\nGod bless the Internet for blessing our social media feeds with such adorable content.", "description": "Internet is full of adorable videos and another treasure has popped up.
