He had a cover story, a 10-page feature, ready and proofed for the page.\n\nBy midday, however, as events unfolded across the Atlantic, it was clear he'd have to change his plans. He scrambled to put together a new cover, featuring the U.S. president. \u201cThis is a big story,\u201d Sych remembered thinking.\n\nTrump's travails are, after all, nearly as much a Ukrainian story as an American one \u2014 featuring as they do a call between the country's two presidents, in which Trump is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Democratic presidential hopeful and former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nUntil the release of a White House \"memorandum\" on the now infamous July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, most Ukrainians hadn't paid much attention to the unfolding scandal. Politicians for the most part thought they could hunker down and wait for the storm to pass.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good image for Ukraine, particularly as Zelenskiy gears up for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which broke out in 2014.\n\nThe details of the call brought the thunder down in Kyiv.\n\nBut for many Ukrainians, this week's biggest revelation was how servile their president looked beside a leader like Trump. Zelenskiy, whose party won by a landslide in parliamentary elections not long before the call took place, fawningly credited Trump for inspiring his \"Servant of the People\" campaign strategy.\n\nThe Ukrainian comedian-turned-politician appeared to agree with everything the president said, making sure to mention he stayed at Trump Tower on a recent visit to New York and acknowledging the U.S. leader\u2019s plane was no doubt \u201cbetter\u201d than his.\n\nReading the memo, Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Kyiv-based Penta Center for Political Studies, felt embarrassed about several passages \u2014 and suspects Zelenskiy did too, he said. \u201cIt will be a lesson for him what to say and not to say in the future.\u201d\n\nMore than anything, Zelenskiy looked out of his depth, said Sych. \u201cHe looks like a very weak negotiator. It\u2019s very tough for him, it\u2019s not his level. The only thing he did was agree with Trump.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a good image for Ukraine, particularly as Zelenskiy gears up for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which broke out in 2014. Zelenskiy\u2019s administration has made ending the war a key goal of his administration. The first prisoner exchange in years between the two countries took place earlier this month, and many had hoped more would follow.\n\nNow some fear Zelenskiy\u2019s chances are dimming. \u201cHe looks like a whipping boy,\u201d said Sych. \u201cIt will be tough for him to stand up for Ukraine\u2019s interests with veterans like Putin.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest risk for Zelenskiy in getting dragged into this fight is the potential damage to Ukraine-U.S. relations \u2014 a fact the Ukrainian president seemed to acknowledge during a press conference in New York with Trump the day the memo was released. \u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d Zelenskiy told the assembled reporters.\n\nThe fear is that, with so much at stake, Washington will now avoid Ukraine like the plague, according to a senior security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The country is highly dependent on the U.S. as an ally, especially in its relations with its aggressive neighbor, Russia. Trump already held back a tranche of military aide worth $250 million in July. \u201cWe are now being played in their personal interest. We are just small change in their games,\u201d the security official said.\n\nThe silver lining for Zelenskiy, however, is that the problem \u2014 for now \u2014 is not one his supporters are following closely. The goings-on across the Atlantic are \"a theme for the elite, for political insiders,\" said Fesenko of the Penta political consultancy. \u201cIt has no impact on the everyman.\u201d\n\nVoters will only change their minds about Zelenskiy when domestic issues \u2014 such as high heating bills or a push to open up the agricultural land market to outside tenders \u2014 start to bite. The latest polls put the president\u2019s approval rating at 71 percent. He might see a dip in the polls as post-election euphoria dies down. But, for now, his domestic position seems secure.\n\nFor Ukraine, this is politics as usual, after all.\n\nKatya Gorchinskaya is a freelance journalist based in Kyiv.", "description": "Phone call memo made Volodymyr Zelenskiy look like US president\u2019s \u2018whipping boy.\u2019", "authors": ["Katya Gorchinskaya", "Paul Dallison", "Caitlin Oprysko", "Anders \u00c5slund"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1171051342-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
