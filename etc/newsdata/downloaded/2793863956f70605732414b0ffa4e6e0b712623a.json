Every time someone tries to ride him he appears to give up the ghost and drops to the floor pretending to be dead.\n\nJingang has got the death trick down so well that he even loosens his tongue and puts his hooves in weird positions to make it look like he can go on no longer.\n\nHis owners say it happens whenever people get onto the saddle.\n\nA man at the ranch who is trying to teach Jingang how to take people for rides around the Korean countryside said that it was \u2018cute but naughty.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe only stays on the ground for a few seconds but the moment anyone starts approaching to get on him again he drops back to the floor.\n\nOne person who viewed the video said: \u2018He\u2019s not lazy, he\u2019s smart. Why carry such a heavy load when you can get away with it.\n\n(Picture: Kritter Klub)\n\n(Picture: Kritter Klub)\n\n(Picture: Kritter Klub)\n\n(Picture: Kritter Klub)\n\n(Picture: Kritter Klub)", "description": "This horse is a very good actor.
