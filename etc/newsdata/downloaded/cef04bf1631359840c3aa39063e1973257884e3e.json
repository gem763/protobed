Recession fears, trade fights, Fed action, impeachment. But in his latest memo, legendary investor Howard Marks tackles a subject that appears to be giving the institutional investor class anxiety: negative interest rates.\n\nSure, Marks says, we know what negative interest rates are: a bank charges depositors to keep their money at the bank instead of offering interest payments.\n\nAs for why negative rates prevail in some economies today, no fewer than a dozen reasons are offered by Marks and colleagues he discussed this memo with for why negative rates exist today. It\u2019s a reason Marks writes that \u201cno one should feel the reasons for negative rates are fully understood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that we know what [negative rates] are,\u201d Marks writes, \u201cdoesn't alter the fact that we don't know for sure why negative rates are prevalent today, how long they'll continue in force, what might cause them to turn positive, what their consequences are, or whether they'll reach the U.S.\u201d\n\nDefining a term means nothing if what you are defining doesn't really make sense. It's just a collection of words.\n\nNow, if there is one thing that financiers believe to be definitely true it is that money lent to a counterparty will be returned at some point in the future, with interest. But negative rates suggest that this always-and-everywhere truth may not, in fact, hold.\n\nNegative interest rates are unprecedented.

For instance, Marks outlines more than 10 different ways that negative rates turn the basic assumptions of financial modeling upside down.\n\nAs Marks notes, \u201cin the financial world, most of our actions are based on the assumption that the future will be a lot like past.\u201d\n\n\u201cPositive interest rates and the desirability of compounding [interest] have been among the most fundamental historical building blocks [in finance],\u201d Marks writes. \u201cAt a minimum, negative rates mean there's increased uncertainty, and thus we have to proceed with more trepidation. Whatever we knew about the past about how things worked, I think we know less when rates are negative.\u201d\n\nNegative rates, in other words, are a classic known unknown. We know what they are. We don't really know what they do.\n\nAnd though investors always hate uncertainty, negative rates that break traditional financial models and short-circuit the Excel file are a bridge too far for some.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
