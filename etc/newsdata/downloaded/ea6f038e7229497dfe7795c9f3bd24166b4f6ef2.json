He is not Indigenous but he works closely with Indigenous staff, students and faculty and is responsible for the Indigenous education materials in the library.\n\n\"I think it's a responsibility for all of us as settlers to learn about these things and to celebrate Indigenous people and Indigenous students for the gifts that they have and the knowledge that they carry,\" he said.\n\nIt's important now for settlers, whether they're educators or not, to step up, said Wong.\n\n\"If there is no commitment from our education authorities, we need to take on the commitment to have these conversations, to talk to the people in our families, our children, our nieces and nephews, about Indigenous education.\"\n\n'Supporting our communities'\n\nThe resources range from books to lesson plans as well as Indigenous language materials and TRC materials for educators.\n\n\"These sorts of initiatives they don't just benefit Indigenous students,\" said Jeffrey Ansloos, a professor at OISE.\n\n\"They lift the entire community up, so I think it's something that we need to care about, not just because it's helping some Indigenous kids or families but it's something that can really transform our entire community.\"\n\n'He is doing the work that's supporting our communities,' says Jeffrey Ansloos, an assistant professor of Indigenous Mental Health and Social Policy at OISE, about Desmond Wong's compiling of Indigenous educational content.
