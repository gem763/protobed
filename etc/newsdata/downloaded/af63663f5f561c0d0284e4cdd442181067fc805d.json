I cannot specify any sector that will not benefit from 5G. The new technology that 5G and we are toward leading the digital future to empower society.\"\n\nBut while the 5G revolution continues at speed, any data-driven technology comes with its challenges.\n\nCosts to build and buy are high, and there are increased fears for cyber-security as these technological industries enter a new digital age.", "description": "Thousands of companies are showing futuristic innovation and technology at GITEX, which is in its 39th year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/79/84/1000x563_cmsv2_917bb843-50b0-56d5-93f2-2d345f8d7bcc-4237984.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
