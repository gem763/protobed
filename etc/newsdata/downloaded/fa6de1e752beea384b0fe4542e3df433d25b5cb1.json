Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nThe political pressure to do something about election security appears to be getting to Senate Majority Leader McConnell.\n\nAs he opened the Senate on Thursday, McConnell (R-Ky.) made sure everyone who was listening knew something: He does indeed support funding election security, after weeks of being derided by Democrats and other critics as \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d for blocking a bipartisan election security bill.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Felicia Sonmez reports, McConnell endorsed $250 million to go to states to help them combat hacking and other election security threats going into the 2020 election cycle. That\u2019s after blocking a House-passed bill with more than double that, $600 million, requiring states to upgrade their aging voting machines and make them less susceptible to Russian hacking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud the financial services and the general government bill included a bipartisan amendment providing another $250 million from the administration to help states improve their defenses and shore up their voting systems,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have helped develop this amendment and co-sponsor it in committee.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to election security, McConnell has been in a tough place, politically: He could pass the major election security bill and risk upsetting President Trump; or block the bill and see what happens. But the political fallout from blocking the bill may have been more than he was expecting. McConnell didn\u2019t have to announce this funding Thursday, which cleared a key committee that morning, but it\u2019s notable that he did.\n\nWhy is election security such a politicized issue in the first place? Because of Trump. He has difficulty acknowledging what intelligence agencies and the Mueller report concluded: that Russians interfered in the U.S. election to try to help him win. And they went beyond pushing fake news on social media or hacking into Democrats\u2019 emails. A bipartisan Senate report found Russians tried to hack voting machines in all 50 states in 2016.\n\nTrump has largely refused to acknowledge all this, has been deferential to Russian President Vladimir Putin on it and is so sensitive to talking about it that a Cabinet secretary was warned against briefing him on it.\n\nIt seems likely that McConnell didn\u2019t want to get in the middle of that. So this summer, when Congress was about to go on recess and Democrats tried to bring up this election security bill, he interjected and stopped it from moving forward.\n\nMcConnell said at the time that the federal government was already working with states to address election interference and that passing more legislation would be too heavy-handed, since states run their own elections. Most, but not all, of his caucus agreed with his position. \u201cSome of my colleagues see this as a first step to nationalizing elections,\u201d Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), who chairs a key subcommittee on all this, said Tuesday about why Republicans oppose giving a significant amount of money to pad states\u2019 efforts to prevent hacking.\n\nNow McConnell is saying it was this $250 million coming through a Republican-controlled Senate that he preferred all along.\n\nElection security experts with whom The Fix spoke in July warned that a couple hundred million is not enough to protect Americans\u2019 voting systems from a threat that Trump\u2019s own head of the FBI warns is coming in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections,\u201d FBI Director Christopher A. Wray testified to senators in July.\n\nThe House bill, which passed with one Republican vote, does \u201csome basic things\u201d to protect U.S. elections, said Suzanne Spaulding, who was an undersecretary at the Department of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama. It\u2019s a package of bills that tries to address disinformation campaigns on social media and ties about $600 million in funding for new election systems in the states to requirements that they upgrade their equipment to make sure they are less hackable. But the perception that voting machines are safe matters, Spaulding said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s important to make sure our elections are secure,\u201d she said in July, \u201cbut what\u2019s critically important is we have a way of assuring the public that their vote was counted as cast.\u201d\n\nWhen McConnell blocked the legislation, it became a national story, perhaps more than he was expecting. (Leading into the 2018 midterm elections, Senate Republicans blocked an election security measure without nearly as much fanfare.)\n\nBut when criticism did start to pick up, McConnell got the support from Trump he ostensibly bargained for. A Washington Post columnist labeled McConnell a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d and McConnell responded on the Senate floor that he was the target of \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism.\u201d\n\nTrump jumped in and backed up McConnell: \u201cI think The Washington Post is a Russian asset by comparison,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cMitch McConnell loves our country. He\u2019s done a great job.\u201d\n\nThose are nice words to hear when you\u2019re McConnell and are up for reelection next year in a pro-Trump state. (His Democratic challenger, Amy McGrath, is raising tons of money but has an uphill climb to unseat him.)\n\nBut after weeks of \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d being a thing, it appears Trump\u2019s support wasn\u2019t enough for McConnell to hold off on all election security bills. And he wanted us to know about it.", "description": "After blocking a bill in July and getting hit for it, McConnell announced he's going to allow some money to help states protect their elections.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eyUeEU1MIWEgCbg1tORiKl_C0I4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GMYTJNWZRQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
