Minister Cho Kuk's passionate commitment to prosecution reform, and his attitude to endure all kinds of difficulties for it, once again aroused sympathy for the urgency of prosecution reform.\"\n\nThe controversy over Cho, as well as public discontent over a sluggish economy and stalled diplomatic efforts with North Korea, have pushed Moon's approval ratings to fresh lows.\n\nIn its latest survey, pollster Realmeter said 41.4% approved of Moon's performance, the lowest since he took office in 2017.\n\nThe survey of 2,502 people conducted last week found 56.1% disapproved of his performance, up from 52.3% in the first week of October, the pollster said on Monday.\n\nCho had attended a news conference earlier on Monday where he released details of proposed reforms to the prosecutor's office, such as closing some powerful investigative units accused by critics of operating without proper oversight.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Jack Kim, Darren Schuettler & Simon Cameron-Moore)", "description": "South Korea's recently appointed justice minister resigned on Monday saying a graft scandal swirling around his family had become a political burden for President Moon Jae-in's government.
