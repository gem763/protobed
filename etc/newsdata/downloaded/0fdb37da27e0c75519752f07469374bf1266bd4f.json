But there\u2019s a good case to be made that these days it applies to the State Department. The complexity of a globalized economy, an immigration debate reduced to sound bites, polarization at home and abroad \u2014 diplomacy in 2019 is a tough business. I have a running bet with my husband \u2014 how long will it take at a dinner party for someone to ask me: \u201cWhy are you still at State?\u201d (It\u2019s usually the third question after \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d and \u201cWhich countries are in Central Africa?\u201d) I often wonder if the subtext is whether I\u2019m concerned, or even ashamed, to be someone who is keeping the ship of State afloat.\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nIt would be easy, perhaps, if the entirety of your Foreign Service career before the 2016 election had been served under a single president, to forget that the oath we take when becoming diplomats says that we serve at the pleasure of the president of the United States. It calls to mind the scene in season one of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d when Ned Stark tells his daughter Arya, \u201cYou were born in the long summer, you\u2019ve never known anything else.\u201d That isn\u2019t a political statement \u2014 merely a reminder that when you\u2019ve known only one kind of life, anything else can seem scary and threatening. Even if it is actually just part of a cycle that has defined our democracy for 243 years and, God willing, will do so for hundreds of years to come.\n\nOur oath commits us to serve at the pleasure of every president elected in the United States, not just the ones whose policies match our political preferences. I\u2019ve had the privilege of serving as a Foreign Service officer for five presidents \u2014 some I voted for, some I didn\u2019t. And my job is to serve each one to the best of my ability. It is our responsibility to provide our best counsel to those in power, even if \u2014 perhaps especially if \u2014 they do not immediately embrace our views.\n\nThat is the role and the responsibility of career public servants in our democratic system. Career members of the Foreign Service are the joists supporting the institutions so that each successive administration \u2014 and the American people \u2014 can rely on their institutional knowledge, network of global relationships and subject matter expertise. Without the framework of a professional career Foreign Service , our nation is weaker and our global power reduced. If we all leave when it gets hard, who will be left to champion American diplomacy?", "description": "Why I stay.
