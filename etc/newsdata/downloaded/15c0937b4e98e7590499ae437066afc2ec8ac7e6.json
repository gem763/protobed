He employed a lean and lethal U.S. force assisted by our allies fighting the Global War on Terror (GWOT) and Syrian Kurds, who are seeking to establish some semblance of normalcy for their ethnic group. In short order, the president\u2019s efforts were a stunning success, killing or imprisoning legions of ISIS savages. His intervention was necessary.\n\nEager to fulfil his promise \u2014 sincerely made \u2014 to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, the president has been frustrated with the difficulty he has encountered in extricating us from \u201cforeign wars.\u201d Moreover, he is under pressure from the libertarians in his party who assert that the Syrian intervention was \u201cnot our war.\u201d In reality, ISIS was and remains inextricably part of the GWOT, having sprouted from the ashes of al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Indeed, AQI itself grew out of the irresolution to intervene effectively with the post-Iraq War insurgency. This compelled President George W. Bush to \u201csurge\u201d forces there in 2007 to successfully suppress AQI.\n\nHowever, when President Barack Obama took the helm, he also demonstrated irresolution by precipitously withdrawing from Iraq in 2011. That was a profound blunder. Iraq wasn\u2019t prepared to stabilize itself from emerging terror insurgencies and, in that environment, ISIS was born, resuming where AQI left off.\n\nThe non-interventionists who are advising the president on the nature of war seem to misunderstand the world this president faces as he attempts to end the conflicts that have cost us much blood and treasure. It is this. The multipolar world of today is multi-dangerous. It doesn\u2019t resemble the bipolar one of yesteryear when superpowers \u2014 the United States and the Soviet Union \u2014 could tame the states over whom they had diplomatic, military and economic influence. Our multipolar world is filed with the likes of Iran, North Korea, Syria and terror organizations including ISIS, al Qaeda and the Taliban, all posing omnidirectional threats to world peace. It\u2019s also populated with uncooperative nations and leaders, indeed even NATO allies like the recalcitrant Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is unpredictable and untrustworthy.\n\nGone are the days when nations could view wars through the sterile lens of non-intervention, dismissing conflicts as \u201cyour war, not ours.\u201d Multipolar realities have changed that. Witness the Saudi Arabian intervention in Yemen to defeat Iranian-backed terror rebels in southern Arabia. That has now escalated and threatens war between Saudi Arabia and Iran following Iran\u2019s attack of a major Saudi oil refinery last month. The GWOT \u2014 including the state sponsors of terror like Iran, Syria and North Korea \u2014 is a profound multipolar threat and can\u2019t be dismissed. The president, unlike his predecessor, defeated ISIS. But the risk he now faces is whether ISIS will resurface in the wake of America\u2019s rapid withdrawal, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nTurkey\u2019s invasion and occupation of northern Syria threatens to upend the situation. The specter of colliding Turkish, Syrian and Russian troops \u2014 all racing to occupy territory formerly controlled by the U.S.-led coalition that defeated ISIS \u2014 is ominous. President Trump\u2019s decision to dispatch Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey to secure a ceasefire has bought valuable time to stabilize the situation. Yet, this remains a multipolar challenge that requires more work.\n\nFirst, the deteriorating 120-hour cessation in fighting needs reinforcement. A no-fly zone over northern Syria would be of value in deterring an escalation of violence between Turks and Kurds, but also meddlesome Syrian and Russian forces. The United States should also deter Iran\u2019s efforts to expand its militia presence northward as it has throughout the southern regions of the Levant bordering our most reliable Middle Eastern ally, Israel.\n\nSecond, the Unied States and Turkey should implement a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in the 20-mile buffer Turkey seeks in northern Syria. It could be policed by the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) \u2014 as they currently do on the Golan Heights and in Southern Lebanon \u2014 or done by a similarly constituted international military coalition. Moreover, a DMZ would permit repatriation of Syrian refugees in Turkey and recently displaced Kurds, resolving a major humanitarian crisis.\n\nThird, sustain a robust military presence in western Iraq to crush any ISIS resurgence in the region.\n\nFourth, President Trump should offer to personally broker peace talks between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds, people the Turks consider terrorists. The mutual hostility between the combatants makes crafting a deal difficult, but that\u2019s reality in a multipolar world.\n\nFinally, the president should make clear to non-interventionists that they should not equate his withdrawal from Syria with hesitation to dispatch and position armed forces when situations require military intervention. After all, Iran, North Korea and the remnants of ISIS are lurking about in this multi-dangerous world.\n\n\u2022 L.
