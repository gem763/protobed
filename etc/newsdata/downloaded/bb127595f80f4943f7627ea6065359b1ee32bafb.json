Most power sources have limits but plants can survive in the shade, naturally moving into position to maximise the potential of absorbing sunlight \u2013 meaning the potential for plant-powered energy is pretty much limitless.\u2019\n\nThe ZSL team will continue to refine the technology before setting up a second trial in the wild.", "description": "The fern has captured the world's first plant-powered pictures.
