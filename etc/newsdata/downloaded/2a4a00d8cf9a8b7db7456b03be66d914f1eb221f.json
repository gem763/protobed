But even its baseline case shows debt rising to 70% of GDP, according to the IIF, a trade group of financial institutions that tracks market conditions worldwide.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa\u2019s debt sustainability is increasingly in question,\u201d the IIF said in its report.\n\nThe South African economy expanded 0.8% in 2018, and in February the National Treasury said it expected 1.5% growth in 2019. But it has since warned it might have to lower that forecast, especially after it granted Eskom a R59 billion, two-year bailout package.\n\nThe IIF said a proposed plan to shift Eskom\u2019s debt to the government would add 6 percentage points to South Africa\u2019s sovereign debt.\n\n\u201cThe key for an improvement of the situation is the implementation of the national growth plan and Eskom restructuring blueprint,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cInvestors and rating agencies will follow the October and February budget announcements closely.\u201d\n\nFinance Minister Tito Mboweni is set to deliver his medium-term budget on October 30.\n\nHe is expected to give details of President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s plan to split Eskom into three units: generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nLabour unions that backed Ramaphosa\u2019s presidential campaign, as well as factions inside the ANC, oppose the plan, raising fears that it may not materialise.\n\nMoody\u2019s, the last of the top three ratings firms to still rank Pretoria\u2019s debt at investment grade, said in September it was unlikely to cut the rating to junk anytime soon, but that the delay over reforming Eskom was a major risk.\n\nInvestors, however, seem to expect a downgrade soon.\n\nAn S&P Capital IQ model, based on credit default swap prices, shows that markets have begun to price in a downgrade.\n\nSince September, the cost of five-year swaps rose 20 basis points to 200 bps on Wednesday, a two-month high, according to data from IHS Markit.\n\n- Reuters", "description": "South Africa\u2019s public debt could rise as high as 95% of gross domestic product by 2024 if the government doesn\u2019t restructure the state-run utility Eskom and implement a workable growth plan, the Institute of International Finance said in report.", "authors": ["Mfuneko Toyana", "Marc Jones"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8617/4faee4efc6924946a157be48ccecddea.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
