Things change so rapidly. Every game is different, so you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. So we\u2019ll just play it by ear and see what happens after this game. And we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\n\nKeenum takes over the starting job from Colt McCoy, who started last week against the New England Patriots. The 31-year-old has started four games this season, but was benched in a Week 4 loss to the New York Giants.\n\nKeenum had battled a foot injury over the past few weeks, though his benching was also related to his inability to hold onto the ball. The quarterback threw a combined four interceptions and lost two fumbles in losses to the Bears and Giants.\n\nMcCoy, though, wasn\u2019t much better in his lone opportunity. In his first start of the season coming off a leg injury, he threw for just 119 yards with an interception. Callahan said McCoy is doing fine healthwise.\n\nRookie Dwayne Haskins will be the backup, meaning McCoy will be inactive Sunday.\n\nAsked why Keenum gives the Redskins the best chance to win, Callahan said, \u201che has the makeup of a solid starter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe prepares like no quarterback I\u2019ve seen, or comparable to the quarterbacks I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cHis demeanor on the field, obviously around the building, he\u2019s the first one in, the last one out type guy. He\u2019s always watching film.\u201d\n\nIn four games, Keenum has thrown for 977 yards and completed 68% of his passes.\n\nCallahan said he\u2019s making Haskins the backup for \u201cobvious reasons,\u201d calling him the future of the franchise.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always invaluable that a quarterback is ready, prepared,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cIt heightens his awareness. We\u2019ve got a package of plays for him going into this game. So this just allows to kind of focus to bring him along and also groom him futuristically.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
