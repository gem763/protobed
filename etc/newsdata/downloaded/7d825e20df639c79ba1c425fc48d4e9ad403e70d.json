My son is disabled and we had been given a Family Fund voucher as part payment for the flights, which had to be booked through its travel agent, Inspire.\n\nAfter completing the reservation online I immediately noticed that the letter \u201ci\u201d was missing from my eight-year-old son\u2019s surname, which was spelt Wahdi. Obviously I had made the mistake when inputting our names. I contacted Lufthansa\u2019s customer services, which said that it could be corrected for a fee of \u20ac25 (\u00a321.61) but the travel agency had to do it.\n\nHowever, Inspire says Lufthansa has refused to allow the correction and the only way my son can be sure of flying is for me to buy him a new ticket for an extra \u00a3290, which we cannot afford. I am puzzled as to why this is such a big deal. Can you explain?", "description": "", "authors": ["Hattie Garlick"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/October/iStock-934913106-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
