Bank of England Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, Dave Ramsden attends a Bank of England news conference, in the City of London\n\n(Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said he did not share the views of some of his colleagues who have suggested the British central bank might cut interest rates if the Brexit crisis drags on beyond the current Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph newspaper, Ramsden said Britain's economy had been so damaged by uncertainty about Brexit - chiefly via a steady fall in investment by companies - that it could hamper the BoE's ability to help it.\n\nReferring to a scenario raised recently by the BoE of \"entrenched uncertainty\" if the deadline for leaving the European Union is pushed back again, Ramsden said: \"I see less of a case for a more accommodative monetary position.\"\n\nFellow BoE rate-setters Michael Saunders and Gertjan Vlieghe have suggested that another delay to leaving the EU might mean lower rates in Britain.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson says he will take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal, but lawmakers have passed legislation which they think will force him to seek a delay if no transition agreement is struck in time.\n\nRamsden told The Telegraph that he was cautious about the economy's growth potential due to Britain's poor record on productivity which contracted at the fastest annual pace in five years in the second quarter.\n\nCompany wage costs were \"picking up quite significantly, which will drive domestic inflationary pressure\" while spare capacity in the economy might not have opened up much despite the weakness in underlying growth, he said.\n\n\"I think supply potential, the speed limit of the economy, is also slowing through this period. That comes through for me pretty clearly in the latest productivity numbers.\"\n\nThe global trade war was weighing on firms' willingness to invest around the world too, Ramsden said.\n\nSeveral BoE officials, including Governor Mark Carney, have said if Britain leaves the EU without a transition deal, they would probably move to cut rates.\n\nRamsden said higher public spending announced by finance minister Sajid Javid would also be a factor for the BoE as it would mean \"more money going into the economy.\"\n\nHe declined to comment when asked by The Telegraph whether he had applied to replace Carney, who is due to leave the BoE at the end of January.", "description": "BoE might not be able to cut rates if Brexit delayed again - Ramsden", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9C0N7_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
