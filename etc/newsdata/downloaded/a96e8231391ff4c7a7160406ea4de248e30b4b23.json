That\u2019s what it looks like if we are to believe reports that an annual fundraising dinner was canceled due to a lack of interest.\n\nDiscord within the state party looks to be coming from the lack of enthusiasm for newly hired Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) executive director Peter O\u2019Rourke. O\u2019Rourke isn\u2019t well-known and trusted yet. Former executive director Jennifer Locetta was fired though she was both well-known and liked. O\u2019Rourke was investigated for rampant abuses in the Department of Veterans Affairs whistleblower office, the office he previously ran. The grassroots are outraged. Governor DeSantis and RPOF Chairman Joe Gruters were caught off-guard by the bombshell findings of the investigation. The internal chaos is reported to be creating a lack of enthusiasm among party members and tickets sales to the 2019 Statesman\u2019s Dinner, a major fundraiser in Orlando are non-existent. The dinner was canceled and rescheduled for December 7. Did the investigation report depress sales and interest? The organizers couldn\u2019t even secure a keynote speaker. President Trump was the first choice of the organizers but they couldn\u2019t nail down a commitment from him.\n\nThe 100-page O\u2019Rourke report landed on a Republican Party already gripped with in-fighting and coping with an underwhelming response to its Statesman\u2019s Dinner, a big annual fundraiser that has yet to attract a keynote speaker and is drawing fewer sponsors than expected going into the 2020 presidential election, people familiar with the planning process told POLITICO. Organizers wanted Trump to speak at the event.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of the dinner\u2019s cancellation was made on Twitter.\n\n\u201c2019 Statesman\u2019s Dinner and Fall RPOF quarterly meeting will be postponed for a later date this year,\u201d the party wrote on its Twitter account. \u201cMore information and exciting news about the rescheduled event will be released soon!\u201d Rumors had circulated for weeks that planning for the party\u2019s major event was hitting snags. The problem was exacerbated by Gruters\u2019 original expectation that Trump himself would serve as keynote speaker. So far, the only confirmed speaker for the event was DeSantis.\n\nThe only table sponsorships were purchased by local Republican Executive Committees. Though Gov. DeSantis pledged to raise millions of dollars, none of that money has come in. Donor and corporate tables have not been sold. Yikes.\n\nThe state party has been in turmoil in recent weeks. DeSantis Chief of Staff Shane Strum and first lady Casey DeSantis are credited (or blamed, depending on which side one comes down on) with putting O\u2019Rourke into the leadership position.\n\nThe investigation into O\u2019Rourke\u2019s previous job performance shows a lack of transparency and a bias toward Trump appointees. The report is described as \u201cscathing\u201d. Is it a case of Trump loyalists versus Never Trumpers in the Florida Republican Party? It sounds like it is. Old leadership versus new blood. Establishment Republicans against populists.\n\nThe department\u2019s Office of Inspector General said O\u2019Rourke tried to bury whistleblower complaints and showed \u201cbias\u201d investigating complaints made against prominent Trump appointees.\n\nFlorida will be a crucial state for President Trump\u2019s re-election bid. It likely will be a must-win state. This is not the time for the state Republican Party to go wobbly, to paraphrase Margaret Thatcher. So, President Trump has been secured to be the keynote speaker for the rescheduled dinner on December 7. You can bet that Trump will be a frequent visitor to Florida in the new year as he rallies voters to come out on election day and vote for his second term in office.\n\nThe dinner was initially scheduled for November, but has been pushed into December to give the party more time to attract interest, especially big-money donors. The annual dinner is a key event leading up to next year\u2019s presidential election, but the unexpected postponement was widely seen as another sign of the leadership turmoil within Florida\u2019s GOP. Florida is crucial to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Key Florida Republicans, including DeSantis, are among some of the president\u2019s most ardent supporters. The visit will be the third to Central Florida this year for President Trump. In June, Trump kicked off his 2020 campaign with a rally at the Amway Center in downtown Orlando. He stopped in The Villages earlier this month to tout his support for Medicare and its private insurance option.\n\nLast year the dinner netted $500,000 for the Republican Party of Florida. It is a pep rally as much as a fundraiser. It will be crucial for the infighting to stop and the state party to come together to work for Trump\u2019s re-election. The question is this \u2013 will the presence of President Trump be a cure for the ills of the state party?", "description": "Unprecedented lack of interest cited", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d339b7fc-9d55-4d1a-b9d7-d135f8e5c4db.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
