Earlier this week, stocks were on an unsure path following both positive and negative reports ahead of the talks.\n\n\"We've seen in the last few months that there's more money on the sidelines,\" Murphy said. \"I think people are trying, they are staying the course, which is great. They're not panicking. But I think they are in a little bit of a wait and see mode.\"\n\nHowever, the opposite holds true for active traders, added Murphy, saying they \"lean into\" the volatility and trade more. \"When there's volatility in the market, they get busy trading,\" she said of Fidelity's \"more active investors.\"\n\nFidelity Investments on Thursday announced that it's offering zero-commission online trades as the brokerage industry moves toward low-fee systems.\n\nThe company eliminated commissions on all of its trades involving stocks, options and exchange-traded funds. The news follows Charles Schwab, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers, which all announced similar moves.\n\nMurphy said Fidelity won't sell clients' stock trade information to hedge funds to make up for offering zero fees.", "description": "\"We've seen in the last few months that there's more money on the sidelines\" among retirement savers, says Fidelity's Kathleen Murphy.", "authors": ["Jessica Bursztynsky", "Kevin Stankiewicz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102732865-GettyImages-94943272.jpg?v=1570791903", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
