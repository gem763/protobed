To me, that\u2019s the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. Not because of its questionable design choices (give me the weird hog, it\u2019s good, actually) but because no matter how great Sonic\u2019s movie design is, Halloween was always coming. And when Halloween rolls around, so do horrifying costumes that barely resemble the things they are based on.\n\nConsider with me Party City\u2019s children\u2019s Sonic costume. Since it is in fact based on the film\u2014which would have been out this year were it not for a last-minute hedgehog makeover\u2014we have a onesie adorned with a weird fur pattern and floppy hood spikes. It is good, perhaps, if you would like to dress up your progeny as sonic, the meme, and not Sonic, the mascot. Get it for your child, and you will quickly become sorry for all the days they wear it that are not Halloween.\n\nThen there\u2019s this fucking nightmare.\n\nThe less said here, the better, but there\u2019s a reason that after years and years of memes and goofballs in blue tights, most have taken to wearing Sonic hoods, not Sonic masks. You\u2019re courting chaos, the way Nic Cage did when he said he\u2019d like to take John Travolta\u2019s \u201cface\u2026..off.\u201d\n\nNone of us are ready for these to hit the streets, let alone the Sonic the Hedgehog film, which I now suspect has been delayed strictly to avoid association with any of this stuff.", "description": "You ever spot a really bad idea and think, \u201cthat\u2019s definitely going to have consequences that no one can foresee\u201d?
