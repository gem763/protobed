On May 9, The New York Times ran an article headlined, \u201cRudy Giuliani Plans Ukraine Trip to Push for Inquiries That Could Help Trump,\u201d which described his search for dirt on the Bidens. (\u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it,\u201d Giuliani told The Time s. \u201cSomebody could say it\u2019s improper.\u201d) The next day a CNN piece was headlined, \u201cGiuliani Defends Going to Ukraine to Press for Investigations Connected to Biden.\u201d As the controversy grew, Giuliani canceled the trip.\n\nSo while it make be a mistake to overestimate the acuity of Trump appointees, it\u2019s probably safe to say that Sondland knew exactly what he was involved with.\n\nHe tried to play the na\u00eff elsewhere in his testimony as well. Toward the end of his statement, he condemned the idea of a president leveraging military aid to get a foreign government to help him politically. \u201cWithholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\u201d\n\nThe record suggests he did. In July, the former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly told his aide Fiona Hill, \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d And as Sondland testified behind closed doors, Mick Mulvaney, the White House acting chief of staff, appeared at a manic, combative news conference and made it clear what said drug deal involved.\n\nOne reason military aid to Ukraine was temporarily frozen, Mulvaney said, was that Trump wanted the country to investigate a conspiracy theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 election. \u201cThe look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney said. He added, sneering: \u201cGet over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a common Trumpist strategy to brazenly admit crimes in public, disorienting people through sheer shamelessness. It\u2019s also common for Trumpists to do what Mulvaney did a few hours later, when he issued a statement denying that he\u2019d said what we all heard him say. (\u201cOnce again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump,\u201d Mulvaney wrote.)\n\nBut Sondland\u2019s not really a Trumpist. Based on news reports, he mostly just seems like an insecure opportunist. According to The Post, Sondland had envied some of his rich friends who\u2019d been given ambassadorships in the past, and coveted one of his own. I can understand the longing for honor and status. Why confounds me is how anyone could think that working for Trump might provide these things, and not see that any title achieved in this crime-syndicate administration will always come with an asterisk after it, or worse.", "description": "He paid $1 million for an ambassadorship and bought himself disgrace.", "authors": ["Michelle Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/opinion/18goldbergWeb/189goldbergWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
