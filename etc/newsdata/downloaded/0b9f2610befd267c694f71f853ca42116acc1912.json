With their Stanley Cup banner getting raised into the arena\u2019s rafters in a pregame ceremony, the Blues and their fans were buzzing as the season opener against the Washington Capitals got underway. For 60-plus minutes the energy pulsed as the game went to overtime knotted at two goals apiece.\n\nThen, the building fell quiet.\n\nThe Blues fed off their home-ice electricity early, but the Capitals weathered the storm, rallied back from a two-goal first-period deficit and ultimately left with a 3-2 win when Jakub Vrana beat Jordan Binnington with a wrist shot with 2:09 left in overtime.\n\n\u201cWe believed in ourselves and figured our game early enough to get it back,\u201d Vrana said. \u201cAnd [that is] the most important thing once you\u2019re down like that early in the game. You have to keep on believing in your game, and that is what we did.\u201d\n\nThe Blues had their chances in the third period but couldn\u2019t solve Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby, who made 20 saves to keep the Blues at bay in a meeting of the past two Stanley Cup champions. Holtby wasn\u2019t happy to give up the early goals but was pleased with how he and his teammates found their footing after the initial rush.\n\n[We asked the Capitals to draw themselves. And they did.]\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not an ideal start to the season,\u201d Holtby said with a sly smile. \u201cI feel like I played the goals pretty well, I just misread bits of them to execute.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals enter this season coming off a first-round playoff exit that left a sour taste in their mouths following the success of 2018.\n\nThat early loss led the team to break apart the group that sent a banner of its own into the rafters of Capital One Arena. New faces entered the room, with a revamped bottom-six forward group and young defensemen getting their shot. In goal, Holtby remains, but 22-year-old Ilya Samsonov won the backup role over incumbent Pheonix Copley. The core is intact \u2014 for now \u2014 and the Capitals want to take advantage.\n\n\u201cThis is the start of a new journey, trying to get the Cup back,\u201d said T.J. Oshie, who assisted on Vrana\u2019s game-winner.\n\nAs the Capitals continue to work their way back to the top, the process will probably come in fits and starts. The opener showed the Capitals\u2019 strengths and weaknesses.\n\nBlues forward Sammy Blais scored 53 seconds into the game when the Capitals were caught scrambling in their own zone and Blais got to the front of the net for an easy tap-in off a silky pass from David Perron. The Blues found the back of the net again with captain Alex Pietrangelo\u2019s one-timer from the left circle on the power play at the 7:55 mark of the first period.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were going to come out really hard,\u201d John Carlson said. \u201cWe could have played a lot better, but I don\u2019t think we played terrible. They just had that little extra juice. . . . I just think we\u2019ve been through these situations a lot and none of us thought we were out of the game.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals cut their deficit in half less than eight minutes later when captain Alex Ovechkin blasted a shot from the right circle, beating Binnington. It was Ovechkin\u2019s 11th goal in 15 career openers, which is the most among active players. Ovechkin said after the game that he felt he was getting a lot of scoring chances and felt \u201cpretty good\u201d on the ice.\n\nIt was the second period that proved to be the turning point for Washington. Holtby was a wall, keeping an explosive St. Louis offense off the score sheet. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov scored the equalizer from the right point on a power play at the 12:28 mark. After just one goal in his last 65 games of last season, Orlov\u2019s tally marked just the second power-play goal of his eight-year career.\n\n\u201cThe second period was a big swing period for us,\u201d Coach Todd Reirden said. \u201c. . . That\u2019s what it\u2019s really about, is everyone stepping up at different times, especially your core guys and your leaders.\u201d\n\nOrlov\u2019s performance was part of a strong night for the Capitals\u2019 blue line, including 19-year-old Martin Fehervary, who held his own in his NHL debut. Reirden praised the rookie, who was given the team\u2019s \u201chard hat award\u201d following the game for his efforts. The award is currently in the form of a Nationals hard-hat.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s only 19 years old, so pretty special to watch that going on,\u201d Reirden said.\n\nFehervary was slated to skate alongside Radko Gudas on the third pairing, but Reirden shuffled the defensive pairings early, moving Fehervary up and down. The group will continue to find its footing with lingering uncertainty about when defenseman Michal Kempny, who tore his hamstring in April, will be able to make his season debut. The team placed Kempny on its injured nonroster list Tuesday, but he was cleared for contact as of Wednesday morning.\n\nAnd while the blue line will probably keep seeing movement as the team continues to mesh, the Capitals will get a look at another new face when they play the New York Islanders on Friday in what is expected to be Samsonov\u2019s NHL debut.\n\n\u201cIt was a good game for the season opener, and now we just need to pick it up and get better and better every game,\u201d Orlov said.", "description": "Vrana\u2019s overtime goal lifts visitors, 3-2, as St. Louis raises its Stanley Cup banner before a meeting of past two champs.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports", "October At Pm", "Samantha Pell Covers High School Sports For The Washington Post.
