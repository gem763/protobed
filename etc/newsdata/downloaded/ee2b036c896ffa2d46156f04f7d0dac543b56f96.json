Within minutes, his supporters were framing the impeachment hearings as an unpatriotic attack on a leader keeping America safe.\n\nTrump celebrated the death of Baghdadi, noting he had \u201cdied after running into a dead end tunnel whimpering and crying and screaming\u201d. The Isis leader was a \u201cdog\u201d, a \u201cgutless animal\u201d, and the Isis militants who died alongside him were \u201closers\u201d and \u201cfrightened puppies\u201d.\n\nIt sounded like the dialogue of a triumphant chieftain in a made-for-TV warrior epic, and at one point Trump confirmed he had witnessed it almost as a piece of cinema, \u201cas though you were watching a movie. The technology alone is really great.\u201d\n\nWhile the prepared statement focused on the special forces who had carried out the raid, the president\u2019s impromptu remarks in answer to reporters\u2019 questions, reverted to the Trumpian norm, presenting it as a personal achievement.\n\n\u201cI kept saying where\u2019s Al-Baghdadi,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been looking for him for three years.\u201d Days earlier, Trump had denigrated his former defence secretary, James Mattis, for being \u201coverrated\u201d and \u201cnot tough enough\u201d, and boasted: \u201cI captured Isis. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.\u201d\n\nThe personality cult that Trump is seeking to construct had already taken on an alarming tone. Over the weekend, his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, had denounced another former aide turned critic, John Kelly, as \u201ctotally unequipped to handle the genius of our great president\u201d.\n\nProfile Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Show Hide Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is thought to have been born in the central Iraqi city of Samarra in 1971. Though a weak student, whose poor eyesight disqualified him from joining the Iraqi military, he rose to command al-Qaeda\u2019s Iraqi division and then broke away to form Islamic State (Isis). In July 2014, shortly after Isis said it had established a caliphate in Iraq and Syria, Baghdadi delivered a sermon from a mosque in the captured Iraqi city of Mosul. Appearing unmasked for the first time, he declared himself to be the caliph: the political and religious leader of the global Muslim community. His declaration was roundly rejected by almost all Islamic religious authorities but his caliphate became a magnet for thousands of foreign fighters and women. The group attempted not just to hold territory but to administer it like a state, establishing a brutal justice system, collecting taxes and doling out public services. Baghdadi had been seen publicly on one other occasion, in an 18-minute video released in April this year. From 2016 he had a $25m bounty on his head. He had been reported to have suffered serious injuries in airstrikes over the years, and there had occasionally been speculation that he had been killed, but he continued to resurface in audio tapes and videos. He killed himself in October 2019, while under attack from US forces.

In one particularly bizarre claim for someone known not to use a computer, the president said that Isis \u201cuse the internet better than almost anyone in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s obsession with his predecessor was also very much at the fore. He left little doubt that Barack Obama\u2019s success in tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden was on his mind. Baghdadi was the greater scalp, he argued. \u201cOsama bin Laden was very big but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cThis is a man who built a whole \u2026 country, a caliphate, and was trying to do it again.\u201d\n\nTrump also repeated a claim that he had somehow had a hand in Bin Laden\u2019s downfall by calling for him to be targeted before the 9/11 attacks, before he was generally perceived as a threat. It is a false claim. Trump mentions Bin Laden in passing in one of his books, does not call for him to be tracked down, and the al-Qaida leader was already widely seen as a substantial threat following several attacks on the US.\n\nWithin minutes a photograph was put online of Trump in the situation room, that recalled the famous picture of Obama and his top aides witnessing the final moments in the hunt for Bin Laden. The Trump version was more formal, more staged, and with the president much more clearly the central, focal point.\n\nWhen Bin Laden was killed in 2011, one of Obama\u2019s first calls was to George W Bush, who had launched the hunt for the al-Qaida leader. By contrast, Trump is seeking to erase the Obama legacy. Secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, repeatedly makes the false claim that it was the current administration that amassed a coalition to defeat Isis. That coalition was almost totally put together and made operational under Obama.\n\nIn anticipating how Trump is likely to spend this treasure trove of political capital, the order in which other parties were given credit is instructive. Russia was named first and repeatedly. Moscow had no part in the operation but after being informed through deconfliction channels that an operation in the Idlib area was imminent they did not try to shoot the US gunships down.\n\nTurkey was thanked several times too, and even the Syrian regime, for no more than being the sovereign power in the territory where the raid took place.\n\nThe commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Kobani, tweeted on Sunday morning that the hunt for Baghdadi had been a five-month US-SDF joint intelligence operation, but in Trump\u2019s remarks, the Kurds were mentioned last and somewhat grudgingly.\n\nTrump has abandoned the SDF and the Kurds in a deal with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, that has allowed Turkey, Russia and the Syrian regime to take over control of northeast Syria, and at the expense of the Kurds. If Mazloum\u2019s claim of the SDF role in the Baghdadi hunt is accurate, the scale of Trump\u2019s betrayal is all the greater.\n\nIn his remarks on Sunday, Trump said Turkey has taken tremendous deaths \u2026 they\u2019ve lost thousands and thousands of people from that safe zone\u201d referring to the border area that was under SDF control. The claim is untrue, but it echoes Ankara\u2019s talking points, equating the SDF with the PKK Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey, and arguing the invasion was an urgent necessity for Turkish security.\n\nIf there was any doubt before this week, Trump made even clearer that his sole preoccupation in Syria was with the oil reserves in the east.\n\n\u201cThe oil is so valuable,\u201d he said. US forces, who have already begun streaming back into Syria heading for the oil fields around Deir Ezzor, would help to keep them out of the hands of Isis. Secondly, oil revenues would help the Kurds.\n\n\u201cAnd number three, it can help us because we should be able to take some also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd what I intend to do perhaps is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s killing will help underline the simple foreign policy message that Trump is crafting for his re-election campaign. He alone inflicted a decisive defeat on Isis. Having achieved that, US troops will be withdrawn except when it is direct US economic interests to stay. Trump\u2019s cooperation with Russian and Turkish leaders had brought about this great success. And lastly, and most importantly, the Democrats, like the intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, are seeking to undermine these achievements with their politically motivated pursuit of impeachment.\n\nOne of the president\u2019s Fox News surrogates, Jeanine Pirro, gave an early taste of White House messaging. \u201cJudge Jeanine\u201d tweeted: \u201cSo proud of @realDonaldTrump taking out abu bakr al bagdadi. Maybe the intelligence committee under @Adam schiff should start focusing on America\u2019s enemies and not their selfish political agenda.\u201d\n\nA lot can still go wrong for Trump. A desire for revenge could trigger an Isis resurgence, aided by the chaos caused by the Turkish offensive. Escaped Isis detainees could be involved in attacks. Conflicts with Iran and North Korea could sour the Trump pitch of having saved America from global conflicts.\n\nBut there is no doubt that a damaged, embattled Trump, who was losing the confidence of even staunch politically allies, is now greatly strengthened.", "description": "President\u2019s supporters framing the impeachment hearings as an unpatriotic attack on a leader keeping America safe", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ad8b85a2873591d71141657aca82bdc5f5955f8/0_203_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4ec9c4cd0e1013c0b7af919d5c3cd23", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
