(AP) - Jarren Williams threw for 254 yards and three scores, and the Miami Hurricanes gave rookie coach Manny Diaz his first victory by beating Bethune-Cookman 63-0 Saturday.\n\nWilliams went 19 for 24 without a turnover or a sack, and his scoring passes covered 22 yards to K.J. Osborn, 32 yards to Michael Harley and 1 yard to Larry Hodges. Williams\u2019 longest throw was to Mark Pope for a 54-yard gain, and he departed late in the third quarter.\n\nDeeJay Dallas ran for 108 yards and three touchdowns. Miami outgained the Wildcats 590-137 and held them to four first downs.\n\nThe Hurricanes (1-2) won their home opener to bounce back from season-opening losses at Florida and North Carolina. With the victory, Miami avoided its worst start since 1975.\n\nDiaz, the Hurricanes\u2019 defensive coordinator from 2016 - 18, replaced Mark Richt after last season as head coach.\n\nBethune-Cookman (1-1) remained winless in five games against Miami, all since 2011, with the defeats by a combined score of 232-37.\n\nThe Hurricanes had nine touchdowns before Bethune-Cookman had its third first down. Dallas scored untouched on a 51-yard run, and scored twice on 1-yard runs.\n\nEXCESSIVE CELEBRATION\n\nSenior Jimmy Murphy, a former walk-on, drew a flag when he did a cartwheel after scoring his first career touchdown on a 4-yard run in the final minutes.\n\nBLING\n\nThe Hurricanes\u2019 turnover chain came out for the first time in two weeks when Robert Knowles recovered a fumble at midfield in the final minute of the first half. Two plays later, with two seconds remaining, Miami made the score 28-0 on Osborn\u2019s touchdown catch.\n\nMiami had no takeaways in last week\u2019s loss at North Carolina.\n\nMISSED CHANCES\n\nThe Hurricanes came up empty in the red zone twice in the first half. Bubba Baxa missed a 30-yard field goal try, and they were stuffed on a fourth-and-1 run.\n\nMiami was 0 for 5 converting thirds downs in the first half.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nPope had three catches for 92 yards before he limped off the field late in the third quarter with an apparent left ankle injury.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nThe schedule is favorable for the Hurricanes, whose next four games are also at home. Their only game against a ranked team is Oct. 11 at home against No. 25 Virginia.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMiami: The Hurricanes play host to Central Michigan and former Florida coach Jim McElwain next Saturday. The teams have never met.\n\nBethune-Cookman: The Wildcats play the second of three consecutive road games Saturday at Mississippi Valley State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jarren Williams threw for 254 yards and three scores, and the Miami Hurricanes gave rookie coach Manny Diaz his first victory by beating Bethune-Cookman 63-0 Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/bethune_cookman_miami_football_75582_c0-147-3529-2204_s1770x1032.jpg?4b79f713fc46a97eaaede17d03714269845dfe85", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
