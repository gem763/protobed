Escaping the NXIVM Cult: A Mother\u2019s Fight to Save Her Daughter, which premiered on Saturday, follows the true story of \u201980s soap actress Catherine Oxenberg\u2019s attempts to loosen her twentysomething daughter India from NXIVM\u2019s grasp.\n\nOxenberg played an important role in exposing Raniere\u2019s horrific crimes through her attempts to save her daughter. She interviewed former members of the cult, compiled a report for the FBI, and spoke with the New York Times. Raniere, 58, was convicted of sex trafficking, among other charges, in June and faces 20 years in prison. The 90-minute TV movie offers PG recreations of the most disturbing details of the NXIVM case, including the branding of female members with Raniere\u2019s initials.\n\nEscaping the NXIVM Cult shows its cards early, leading with a scene straight out of a (very tame) horror movie. Shots of a shadowy suburban neighborhood, complete with cul-de-sacs and neat rows of townhouses, convey that the extraordinary horrors of NXIVM occurred behind closed doors in an ordinary town.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, it all looked so normal,\u201d says fictionalized Catherine Oxenberg (Andrea Roth) in voiceover. \u201cNot like anything you\u2019ve read about or seen in the movies. There was no creepy compound behind a fence. That would have been a dead giveaway. Instead, the houses were embedded into suburban neighborhoods.\u201d A pause, and then: \u201cJust like yours and mine.\u201d\n\nThrough gauzy curtains obscuring the windows of one house, we see a group of women in various stages of undress crowded around a massage table. The glowing, white-hot tip of an iron signals what is to come. A disembodied female voice whispers, \u201cTime to meet your sisters.\u201d The cult members restrain a writhing, screaming young woman as the iron makes contact with the flesh just above her pelvis.\n\nLater, we see this scene again, in context, but by then the movie has gone so stale that it doesn\u2019t pack the same punch. The fact that they use the same scene twice, not to mention showing it almost in full as the centerpiece of the trailer, should tell you everything you need to know about how (un)interesting the rest of the film is.\n\nThe poor girl strapped to the massage table in suburban New York hell is India Oxenberg (Jasper Polish), the college dropout daughter of Dynasty actress Catherine. Roth, best known for playing Janet Gavin in FX\u2019s Rescue Me, does her best impression of Nicole Kidman in the Big Little Lies therapy scenes as Catherine, a distressed mother and survivor of childhood sexual abuse.\n\nCatherine initially invites India to accompany her to an NXIVM \u2018Executive Success Program\u201d seminar in Albany, but she soon begins to take issue with some of the misogynistic messages preached by the program\u2019s \u201cteachers\u201d\u2014like the ideas that men are more loyal than women and that men never enjoy true sexual intimacy in the way that women do. She first grows suspicious when the member questionnaire includes queries like, \u201cWhat is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to you?\u201d and \u201cWhat have you done that you\u2019re most ashamed of?\u201d \u201cWhat on earth do these questions have to do with being successful in business?\u201d she murmurs to her daughter.\n\n\u201c From the outside, it all looked so normal \u201d\n\nIndia, however, who is struggling to launch her career as a baker and dreams of owning her own caf\u00e9, is entranced by NXIVM\u2019s promise to help her \u201clearn all the tricks in the book so you can stop getting in your own way all the time.\u201d Enter Smallville actress Allison Mack (Sara Fletcher), whom India immediately and excitedly recognizes. Mack takes a particular interest in India, exploiting the young woman\u2019s vulnerability.\n\nTo the dismay of Catherine, India decides to stay in Albany. She is soon inducted into a cult of sex slaves for NXIVM founder Keith Raniere, branded with his initials, forced to starve herself to adhere to his sexual preferences, and blackmailed with personal information and nude photos referred to as \u201ccollateral.\u201d\n\nWe first meet Keith Raniere, an L. Ron Hubbard-type self-styled genius and the villainous mastermind behind it all, about 25 minutes into the movie. Played by Peter Facinelli, Lifetime\u2019s Raniere wears thick-framed spectacles, is a sore loser in volleyball matches, and greets female NXIVM members with kisses on the mouth.\n\nIn Escaping the NXIVM Cult, the very real torture endured by NXIVM members is often undermined by cheesy, on-the-nose dialogue and over-acting. In one scene, for example, Fletcher\u2019s Allison Mack disturbingly reveals to India that she limits her daily calorie intake to 800 because it \u201churts [Keith] when I\u2019m heavier.\u201d\n\nAs Allison pulls a bowl of assorted vegetables from the fridge, India suggests, \u201cI could make us a really good honey mustard dressing.\u201d \u201cMm, too fattening, girl!\u201d Allison replies, biting into a piece of raw broccoli with a noisy crunch. \u201cWe are never going to get to 106 like that.\u201d NXIVM\u2019s abusive pattern of starving members is only referenced on one other occasion, when Catherine remarks that she is concerned by India\u2019s weight loss.\n\nEssentially\u2014and unsurprisingly\u2014Lifetime\u2019s stab at telling Catherine and India Oxenberg\u2019s story does not offer anything new to the narrative surrounding the highly-publicized criminal case. In a few years\u2019 time, it will probably be adapted into an HBO miniseries with the budget, talent, and unflinching gaze required to do the terrifying story justice.", "description": "\u2018Dynasty\u2019 actress Catherine Oxenberg\u2019s fight to reclaim her daughter from a sex cult takes center stage in Lifetime\u2019s \u2018Escaping the NXIVM Cult.\u2019", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569133968/190922-julian-nxivm-hero_thlqk9", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
