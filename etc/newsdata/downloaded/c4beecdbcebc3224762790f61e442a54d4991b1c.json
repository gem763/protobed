The Brazilian company\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, JBS USA, grew to be the second-largest U.S. producer of beef, pork and poultry through a string of high-profile acquisitions.\n\nMenendez and Rubio asked Mnuchin to investigate whether JBS SA funded its massive U.S. expansion through an extensive record of bribery, corruption and business with blacklisted Venezuelan officials.\n\nJBS SA owners Joesely and Wesely Batista have admitted to spending roughly $150 million to bribe more than 1,800 Brazilian government officials to secure $1.3 billion in loans from the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) and federal pension funds.\n\nWhile BNDES loans are meant exclusively to fund domestic investments in Brazil, the Batistas are alleged to have used that financing to expand JBS\u2019s U.S. operations. The Department of Justice has also opened an investigation into whether JBS violated federal anti-corruption laws, according to court records obtained by The Hill and other media outlets.\n\nMenendez and Rubio wrote that the DOJ probe \u201conly underscores our concerns that the questionable nature of JBS S.A.\u2019s financial practices poses significant risks for its American subsidiaries and the U.S. food system.\u201d\n\nJBS SA spokesman Cameron Bruett said in a statement that the company is \"aware of the letter sent to Secretary Mnuchin,\" and \"has fully cooperated with all relevant authorities in a transparent manner regarding past events in Brazil.\"\n\n\"The company will continue to cooperate and respond to any subsequent inquiries,\" Bruett said.\n\nJBS has faced bipartisan fire throughout 2019 as the company\u2019s U.S. subsidiary raked in more than $90 million in Agriculture Department aid for American farmers hurt by President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi hits back at Trump over letter: 'Only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy' Trump directed Perry, State Dept. officials to talk to Giuliani on Ukraine: report Murkowski warns against rushing to conclusions on Trump impeachment MORE\u2019s trade war with China.\n\nControversy over JBS\u2019s federal aid is one of several issues threatening to derail multiple spending bills from reaching Trump\u2019s desk before the Nov. 22 expiration of a short-term government funding measure.\n\nBut Menendez and Rubio have also expressed concerns with the Batista brothers\u2019 close ties to the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The senators cited JBS\u2019s involvement in Venezuela\u2019s food procurement system and the Venezuelan Foreign Trade Corporation, which the Treasury Department has labeled a key player in public corruption.\n\nMenenedez and Rubio additionally singled out the Batistas' relationship with top Maduro ally Diosdado Cabello, a powerful lawmaker who helped cultivate the relationship between JBS and the Venezuelan government.\n\nRubio, an avid critic of Maduro, received death threats in 2017 that may have come from Cabello, according to the Miami Herald.", "description": "A bipartisan Senate duo asked the Treasury Department on Tuesday to investigate a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/rubio_menendez.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
