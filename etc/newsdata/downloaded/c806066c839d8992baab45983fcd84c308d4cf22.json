He plays Sheldon Cooper, a 9-year-old High School student. The episode in question includes a sound effect accompanying a tornado warning, which resembled emergency alert system tones, the FCC said in a statement explaining the fine.\n\nThe current action comes on the heels of massive fines by the FCC in August when the government agency went after networks ABC, AMC, and Discovery for similar offenses on shows like, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d and \u201cLone Star Law.\u201d At that time, the FCC levied more than $600,000 in fines for abusing the alert system.\n\nThe FCC notification delivered to CBS is known as a Notice of Apparent Liability of Forfeiture which will give the offending network time to respond and defend its actions. The government agency will then have an opportunity to amend its ruling before formally handing down the fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency explained that the current actions against CBS for broadcasting simulated emergency tones during non-emergencies is not only a violation of FCC rules but it also creates a serious public safety concern especially during actual emergencies such as the damage caused by Hurricane Dorian during which emergency tones were used throughout affected areas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe agency also said that CBS\u2019 modifications to the EAS tones were still not permissible because the tones used in the episode of \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d were \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to actual EAS tones.\n\nAn enforcement advisory from the FCC last month reiterated that broadcasting actual or simulated emergency tones during non-emergencies and outside of testing periods is an FCC violation and \u201cserious public safety concern.\u201d", "description": "FCC hits CBS with $272,000 fine over misuse of EAS tones.", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Iain-Armitage-.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
