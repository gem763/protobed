Qiagen's 21% tumble led losses after the biotech company said its chief executive would step down and warned on third-quarter preliminary sales.\n\nAll major sectors in Europe were in the red, and while most of the big markets in the region slid more than 1%, losses in London's FTSE 100 were limited to 0.8% as its exporters benefited from a battered pound.\n\nThe currency lost 0.7% after a Downing Street source said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had spoken and that she had made clear a deal was \"overwhelmingly unlikely\".\n\nInvestors are waiting to know if this is the official response from the European Union to prepare for a hard Brexit, said IG's Mahony.\n\n\"Auto sales have been hit particularly hard by a lack of demand from the UK, so certainly the German economy has felt the uncertainty around Brexit.\"\n\nGermany's export-reliant DAX fell 1.1%, with an unexpected rise in August industrial output providing little relief from fears of the economy slipping into recession.\n\nAmong stocks, some weak forecast and takeover concerns weighed on the biggest decliners. Shares of London Stock Exchange Group dropped 5.8% after Hong Kong's bourse withdrew its $39 billion bid.\n\nEnergy firm Uniper slumped 8.5% as Finnish utility Fortum got closer to full ownership of the German firm, a move Uniper's top management had warned could threaten the firm's credit rating.\n\nProfit-taking got the best of British airline easyJet with some brokers also disappointed by a lack of positivity in the company's outlook. The carrier's 7.5% slide dragged Europe's travel and leisure sector down 1.8%, the biggest decline among major sectors.\n\nAt the other end, shares of Airbus rose 0.4% after the planemaker reported higher orders for the first nine months of the year, putting it well ahead of U.S. rival Boeing. Boeing's sales have been hampered by the grounding of its fast-selling jet, the 737 MAX, in the wake of two accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nNordic telecom companies Nokia Oyj and Ericsson rose after a report said the U.S. government had suggested issuing credit to help compete with China's Huawei.\n\n(Reporting by Medha Singh and Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr and Pravin Char)", "description": "European shares fell on Tuesday as an escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions and Brexit worries along with disappointing corporate news dented sentiment.
