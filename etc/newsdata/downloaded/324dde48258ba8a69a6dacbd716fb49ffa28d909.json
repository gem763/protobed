Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to deliver the third straight U.S. interest rate cut this week -- but the real news will be if he signals the end of the easing cycle or leaves the door open for more.\n\nRecent U.S. economic data has been mixed, with weakness among manufacturers contrasting with resilient consumers who contribute the lion\u2019s share to national output.\n\nWho\u2019s Who on the Fed\u2019s Dot Plot?\n\nThere are also central bank decisions in Japan, Canada, Brazil and Colombia, and the first estimate of third-quarter GDP in the euro area. Data watchers: don\u2019t forget the clocks go back in Europe this weekend.\n\nWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say...\n\n\u201cThe Federal Reserve will not take any chances this week by defying market expectations for additional accommodation -- we expect the central bank to deliver a third consecutive rate cut at the FOMC meeting. Had policy makers held strong reservations against the anticipated move, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Richard Clarida would have pushed back against it in remarks prior to the blackout period; they chose not to.\u201d\n\n--Yelena Shulyatyeva and Carl Riccadonna\n\nHere\u2019s what happened last week and below is our weekly wrap of what\u2019s going on in the world economy this week.\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision on Wednesday comes hours after U.S. GDP data is expected to show another slowdown in the third quarter. Investors see another quarter percentage point move when policy makers wrap up their two-day gathering, yet only price in one more reduction over the following six months\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly made clear he wants lower borrowing costs, and he continued the pressure last week, saying that the Fed would be \u201cderelict in its duties\u201d if it doesn\u2019t cut further. However, if Powell sticks with his oft-repeated line that the domestic economy is hanging in there, and the cuts are insurance against trade uncertainty and weakness abroad, it will probably solidify views that Fed has put policy on hold.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Canada, the Group of Seven\u2019s most dovish central bank, is expected to keep on resisting looser monetary policy at a rate decision Wednesday.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics full Week Ahead for the U.S\n\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\n\nIt\u2019s Mario Draghi\u2019s last week as European Central Bank president before he hands over to Christine Lagarde, and both are due to speak at a farewell event for the outgoing chief on Monday.\n\nThat\u2019s before a hectic few days, with third-quarter GDP due from France, Italy, Spain, Austria and Belgium. There\u2019s also a first estimate for the euro zone, forecast to record just 0.1% growth, as well as confidence and inflation numbers for October. But we have to wait another two weeks for German GDP, and confirmation of whether Europe\u2019s largest economy is or isn\u2019t in a technical recession.\n\nTurkey\u2019s central bank governor will face investors when he presents the quarterly inflation report on Thursday, after cutting interest rates by a cumulative 1,000 basis points in his past three meetings. In the Gulf, an outlier to the central banks following the Fed could be Kuwait: it may ease as pressure builds on bank funding costs and economic growth is forecast at just above zero.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for EMEA\n\nAsia\n\nThe Bank of Japan is set to lower its forecasts for economic growth and inflation this year in a quarterly outlook report to be released at the end of a policy meeting on Thursday. But that may be where the excitement ends. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s call in September for a review of how its mission to stimulate price growth could be threatened by the global slowdown spurred speculation that October would be the month for policy action, yet the need to ramp up stimulus still isn\u2019t clear-cut.\n\nIn China, the first numbers from the fourth quarter will be released when the official PMI report for October is released on Thursday.\n\nFor more, read Bloomberg Economics\u2019 full Week Ahead for Asia\n\nLatin America\n\nBrazil is expected to deliver a third straight 50 basis-point cut to its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, lowering borrowing costs to an all-time low of 5%, as inflation runs below the floor of the central bank target and the recovery falters for a third consecutive year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
