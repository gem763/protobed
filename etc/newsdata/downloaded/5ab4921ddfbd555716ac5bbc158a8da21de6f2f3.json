The rocket took off at 9:22 PM ET (6:22 PM PT), during its second launch opportunity of the day after the first window was pushed due to high altitude winds.\n\nThis is the ninth Electron launch for the company thus far, and the eighth mission for a commercial customer (the first was a test mission in 2017) since it began ferrying payloads for paying clients in 2018. Today\u2019s launch carried a satellite called \u2018Palisade\u2019 for client Astro Digital, which is a technology demonstrator that will test the company\u2019s next-generation geocommunications satellite design.\n\nThis mission was a late-stage substitute, swapping in for another Rocket Lab client who had to delay their own launch. Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck told TechCrunch that \u201cElectron is a launch on demand service \u2014 we\u2019re ready when the launch customer is,\u201d highlighting the flexibility of the launch service they offer to adapt to the needs of their customers.\n\nAfter successful launch and kick stage separation, the Astro Digital satellite now awaits its final deployment into its target orbit, which should happen in the next few hours. We\u2019ll update with the results of that maneuver.", "description": "Rocket Lab has added another successful commercial launch to its track record: The rocket startup\u2019s \u2018As The Crow Flies\u2019 mission took off today from its LC-1 launch site in New Zealand as planned.
