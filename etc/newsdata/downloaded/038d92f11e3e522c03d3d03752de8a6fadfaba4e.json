Farrow reports Weinstein hired Black Cube\u2014an Israeli private-intelligence agency\u2014to spy on women who had accused Weinstein as well as reporters who were investigating the claims.\n\nFarrow writes that one Russian-American agent, Roman Khaykin, and one Ukrainian-American, Igor Ostrovskiy, were both private investigators who were hired by Black Cube as subcontractors. They were reportedly asked to surveil people on target lists provided to Black Cube by Weinstein and his lawyers. In the fall of 2017, the pair turned their attention to Farrow by staking out his apartment building and trailing him to his workplaces.\n\nKhaykin reportedly claimed to have used Farrow\u2019s cellphone to track his location, and is alleged to have sent multiple screenshots of maps with a location pin that showed where the journalist was. However, a Black Cube source insisted to Farrow that the agency was unaware of, and didn\u2019t authorize, any form of cellphone tracking against him.\n\nShortly after The New Yorker published the first of Farrow\u2019s Weinstein stories in October 2017, Farrow reports he received a mysterious text message referencing an old social-media post of his. In July 2017, he posted a picture of a frying pan that was branded Black Cube with the caption: \u201cScratch resistant. May use false identities and shell companies to extract information.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous text said: \u201cI am trying to reach you directly and privately. It\u2019s regarding a Fry Pan that\u2019s Scratch Resistant. Sometimes I cook and the black coating scares me.\u201d\n\nThe text was from Ostrovskiy and the two then met in a New York restaurant where Farrow said the man voiced his concerns about his Black Cube work. He said his usual work \u201cmight not be ethical, but it\u2019s legitimate,\u201d and explained that he felt his Black Cube work \u201cmay be illegal.\u201d The Ukrainian then described the spying techniques he used against Farrow, and said he had objected to the tactics that had been used against him.\n\nAfter their meeting, Ostrovskiy\u2019s work for Black Cube went disastrously wrong when an operative was exposed during a meeting he was monitoring with watchdog group Citizen Lab. AP journalists observed the meeting and reported on the agents watching over them and saw that the spy at the meeting, under the guise of an investor, was recording it.\n\nThe cover was blown and the furious Black Cube leadership ordered everyone involved, including Ostrovskiy, to take a polygraph. Farrow writes that Ostrovskiy\u2014concerned that his talks with Farrow could be discovered\u2014then decided he wanted to talk to the FBI, hired a whistleblower attorney, and began the process of becoming a voluntary witness.\n\nFarrow and Ostrovskiy met again earlier this year and the Ukrainian is now starting his own private investigation firm, but has said he will now only carry out jobs if they have public-service angle.\n\nThe next two excerpts of Farrow\u2019s book will be published by The New Yorker Tuesday and Wednesday.", "description": "The first excerpt of the journalist\u2019s book details how he was put under surveillance\u2014only for an agent to feel guilty and explain what had been going on.", "authors": ["Jamie Ross"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1912,w_3400,x_0,y_116/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570446199/RTX6ODUB_zktl7o", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
