This will now typically act as support. $8,380s could act as resistance but price can run up to $8500s with a break above there,\u201d he noted.\n\n$BTC \u2013 As you can see from the blue lines and volume profile Bitcoin price managed to break and close above the highest volume areas in this range This will now typically act as support $8,380s could act as resistance but price can run up to $8500s with a break above there pic.twitter.com/06PaiqdjTa \u2014 Josh Rager \ud83d\udcc8 (@Josh_Rager) October 8, 2019\n\nThe coming hours and days will likely offer the markets significant insight into whether or not Bitcoin will be able to continue the uptrend it has been caught within throughout 2019, or if it will continue to cut deeper into its year-to-date gains.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Analysts are noting that the price level that exists directly above Bitcoin's current price could be a major level of resistance for BTC in the near-term.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_554244451-5-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
