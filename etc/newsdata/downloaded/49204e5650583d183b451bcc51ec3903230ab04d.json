His remarks sparked a rush into the shares of firms engaged in, or believed to be engaged in blockchain or digital currency-related businesses.\n\n\"Blockchain's future is here but we must remain rational,\" the People's Daily newspaper, which is published by China's ruling Communist Party, said in a commentary late on Monday.\n\n\"The rise of blockchain technology was accompanied by that of cryptocurrencies, but innovation in blockchain technology does not mean we should speculate in virtual currencies,\" it said.\n\nThe government cracked down on the country's cryptocurrency industry in 2017 with regulators banning the practice of creating and selling virtual currencies or tokens and shutting local cryptocurrency trading exchanges, saying that they were facilitating illegal fundraising and pyramid schemes.\n\nChinese officials, however, said at the time that the research into blockchain technology was still encouraged although Xi's comments were the first time Beijing had publicly thrown such vocal support behind the sector.\n\nBeijing is also creating its own central bank-issued digital currency to cut the costs of circulating traditional paper money and boost policymakers' control of money supply.", "description": "China state paper urges calm after blockchain stocks, bitcoin soar", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9S0E2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
