Nowadays they share a WhatsApp group called \u201cCampeones 86\u201d that has engaged on the unlikely topic of Bangor City since Pasculli was appointed manager of the historic but troubled club this month. The Campeones have plenty to discuss.\n\n\u201cThe sensation of holding the World Cup was like touching the sky with your hand,\u201d the 59-year-old Pasculli recalls of the moment Maradona passed him the trophy in Mexico.\n\nWorld Cup stunning moments: Diego Maradona's Hand of God | Scott Murray Read more\n\nThe Azteca Stadium must feel every second of its 33 years away. The rain is pouring as Bangor\u2019s manager prepares a multinational squad of part-time players for his first game in Cymru North, a 1-1 draw at Ruthin Town. Bangor is the 13th job of Pasculli\u2019s managerial career, a varied CV that includes Albania\u2019s Dinamo Tirana and the Uganda national team, and it is one he has taken in inauspicious circumstances.\n\nAfter a turbulent few years under the controversial ownership of Vaughan Sports Management Bangor reside in the second tier of the Welsh football league. The club was taken over in September by a consortium led by Domenico Serafino, an Italy-born musician who has spent most of his life in Buenos Aires. There he became friends with Sergio Batista and Jorge Luis Burruchaga, two other members of Argentina\u2019s 1986 World Cup team, and through them he met Pasculli.\n\nSerafino discovered Bangor through his son Francesco, who joined the club in May. And so a World Cup winner and professional musician are sitting together at the EuroGold Stadium, posters of Bangor\u2019s greatest European nights decorating the walls, discussing plans for the club\u2019s revival. Max Leghissa, Bangor\u2019s director of football, also sits in on the interview.\n\n\u201cBatista and Burruchaga would come to my concerts and Fernando Batista, Sergio\u2019s brother, trained my son at Argentinos Juniors,\u201d Serafino says. \u201cAnd Argentinos Juniors is where I first played with Maradona,\u201d says Pasculli, who in 1985 moved to Lecce, where he became the second-highest goalscorer in the club\u2019s history.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pasculli puts his international squad through their paces. Photograph: Colin McPherson/The Guardian\n\n\u201cThen I roomed with him at the World Cup. That was a real pleasure. We were forwards together at Argentinos Juniors and even then it was clear how special he was but he never made you feel different. He was always part of the team. If you made a mistake he would always support you. He is a great man off the pitch as well as on it and he is still a real friend. We were such a close group and we are still in touch with each other today. We have a WhatsApp group called \u2018Campeones 86\u2019 that we use all the time, including Maradona.\u201d\n\nPasculli started Argentina\u2019s opening game of the World Cup against South Korea, with Jorge Valdano as his strike partner. He was on the bench for the remaining group matches against Italy and Bulgaria, and the knockout rounds against England and Belgium as well as the final against West Germany, but made a decisive contribution with the winner against Uruguay in the last 16.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carlos Bilardo cries with Pedro Pasculli after the 1986 World Cup final. Photograph: El Grafico/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThat goal was very important not just for getting us through but for changing the belief around us in that tournament,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was such a big game for us, a South American derby, and Argentina hadn\u2019t beaten Uruguay at a World Cup for 56 years. The journalists who followed the national team at that time didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it through the group stage but we were the first team to arrive in Mexico and the last to leave. Uruguay were a good and hard South American team. Beating them removed a big obstacle.\u201d\n\nPasculli knows what is coming next and mention of \u201cHand of God\u201d leaves him convulsing with laughter. He leaps from his chair to perform an impression of Peter Shilton towering above Maradona, then looking on aghast having been \u201cpickpocketed\u201d by Argentina\u2019s diminutive No 10.\n\n\u201cOn the bench we didn\u2019t realise what he had done,\u201d Pasculli says. \u201cMaradona\u2019s reaction to the goal was a normal celebration; he just ran to the corner and the team ran after him. We didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done until he told us all at full-time. We were all laughing. To us it showed he was great even in the smallest details. Even if it was unfortunate for the English [cue more laughter] it wasn\u2019t something a normal person would think of doing. It takes someone special to think of doing that and pulling it off but his second was simply the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bangor\u2019s squad includes 21 players from Italy, six from England and one from Wales. Photograph: Colin McPherson/The Guardian\n\n\u201cWhen [H\u00e9ctor] Enrique gave him the ball inside our half and he started dribbling we all started to rise up on the bench, a little bit after the first player, then a little more after the second, more after the third until we were all on our feet because we knew he was going for the goal. He\u2019d tried something similar for Barcelona but didn\u2019t score that time. The feeling when he scored was incredible. We were all going crazy on the bench, even [coach Carlos] Bilardo. Even the England supporters inside the stadium were applauding him. It was one of the best goals of the century.\u201d\n\nThe pressure and expectation on Maradona were intense before the final but, in the sanctuary of their hotel room, only Pasculli felt it. \u201cOur room wasn\u2019t anything special and our beds were near to each other. I was so anxious but Maradona said: \u2018Just stay calm, we have a game tomorrow.\u2019 Five minutes after getting in bed he was asleep! I was awake until 4 or 5am. No normal person could have slept that easily the night before a World Cup final but seeing him so calm convinced me we were going to win the World Cup.\u201d\n\nAt Bangor, you suspect, there is more convincing to do. In April a group of supporters formed their own club \u2013 Bangor 1876 \u2013 having had enough of the financial problems under VSM that prompted the Football Association of Wales to revoke Bangor\u2019s Uefa licence and HMRC to issue a winding-up petition in 2018, later dismissed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In May Bangor were docked 42 points by the FAW for various regulation breaches. That was reduced to 21 points after an appeal, enabling the club to compete in the second tier. Photograph: Colin McPherson/The Guardian\n\nIn May the club was docked 42 points by the FAW for regulation breaches. That was reduced to 21 points after an appeal to the court of arbitration, enabling Bangor to compete in the second division rather than third, while a transfer embargo prevented the club from signing players on professional contracts. Only one player stayed this summer while a remarkable 21 from Italy arrived, along with players from Portugal, Ghana and Guinea-Bissau plus one from Wales and six from England.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cThis is not about Italians coming here to work,\u201d Serafino says. \u201cWe have had former players and Welsh players contacting us to come back since we took over. People are thinking about Bangor again as a stable club and they can see we are serious about the future. We know it is going to be difficult but we will gain the confidence of the people by working hard day after day. We plan to bring back the academy and have a community project that benefits the whole city. We will return the club to where it should be.\u201d", "description": "World Cup winner at the second-tier Welsh club tells Andy Hunter about the \u2018Campeones 86\u2019 WhatsApp group and Maradona\u2019s calming influence", "authors": ["Andy Hunter"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d92da50394a5507dc8978f0feee980448370d62/0_241_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=786b6fe6edd4b31bf1bf2c862d785440", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
