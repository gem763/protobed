Well I\u2019m for Barack. I think Obamacare worked,\u201d Mr Biden said at one point. \u201cThis is about candour, honesty, big ideas.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave.\u201d\n\nMr Biden did not have the strongest performance of the ten candidates on the stage at Texas Southern University; that distinction probably belonged to Ms Warren or Beto O\u2019Rourke, who appeared reinvigorated and impassioned as he demanded action on gun control to tackle the nation\u2019s plague of massing shootings, and denounced the racism coming from the Oval Office he believed has fuelled some of those incidents.\n\n\u201cWe have a white supremacist in the White House and he represents a mortal threat to the nation,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Rourke, who was last month visibly moved by the mass shooting at a Walmart in his home town of El Paso. He repeated a pledge that as president he would ban weapons such as semi-automatic AR-15 rifles, and oversee a forced buy-back from the government.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15,\u201d he said.\n\nYet by the low bar Mr Biden had set for himself \u2013 at one point he referred to Mr Sanders as \u201cthe president\u201d \u2013 he will have considered his performance in Houston, a place where he first debated in 1987 during his maiden presidential run, to have been a success. Aware that he was likely to come under fire from anyone on the stage, he looked less frozen and startled.\n\nHe also repeatedly referred to his work as vice president of Barack Obama, a strategy he believes will appear to those voters looking for experience amid the perceived chaos of the Trump administration. In a moment that highlighted Mr Biden\u2019s age, at one point he referred to helping motivate children to learn by getting them listening to a \u201crecord player\u201d.\n\nCory Booker, Julian Castro and Kamala Harris also sought to use the event to add some momentum to their polling numbers that have stalled behind those of Mr Biden, Ms Warren and Mr Sanders.\n\nAmy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota who has portrayed herself as someone who can bridge extremes within the party, failed to make much traction. Andrew Yang was also unable to grab as many of the speaking opportunities as he might have done, but when he spoke it was thoughtful.\n\nDuring his opening statement, the tech entrepreneur said he was planning a giveaway in which 10 families would receive $120,000 over the next year \u2013 a beta trial of his signature universal basic income initiative, in which every citizen over 18 would receive $1,000 per month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop trusting politicians and start trusting ourselves \u2013 so I\u2019m going to do something unprecedented tonight,\u201d Mr Yang said.\n\nAt one point, Mr Castro, who served in Mr Obama\u2019s administration as a housing secretary, appeared to make a jab at Mr Biden\u2019s age, and accused him of flip-flopping in his description of his own health care plan. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d asked the 44-year-old Mr Castro, another Texan.\n\nWhen Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, highlighted the clash, saying it was what so many Americans did lot like about politicians, Mr Castro punched straight back. He said: \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Joe Biden angrily clashed with many of his Democratic rivals \u2013 among them progressives Bernie Sanders\u00a0and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 as the former vice president fought to hold on to his status as frontrunner in the fight to take on Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/22/biden-fight.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
