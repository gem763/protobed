UPDATE 7-Oil slides as U.S., China add more tariffs in trade war\n\n* U.S. imposes 15% tariffs on range of Chinese goods\n\n* China levies tariffs on U.S. oil for first time\n\n* Graphic on U.S. oil rig count: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XdttIW\n\n\n\n(Updates with Brent settle)\n\nBy Gary McWilliams\n\nHOUSTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices weakened on Monday\n\nafter new import tariffs imposed by the United States and China\n\ncame into force, raising concerns about a further hit to global\n\neconomic growth and demand for crude.\n\nInternational Brent crude futures settled down 59\n\ncents to $58.66 a barrel, after trading as low as $58.10 during\n\nthe day. U.S. benchmark WTI crude was down 33 cents at\n\n$54.77 a barrel. Activity was thin because of the U.S. Labor Day\n\npublic holiday.\n\nThe United States began imposing 15% tariffs on a variety of\n\nChinese goods on Sunday - including footwear, smart watches and\n\nflat-panel televisions - as China put new duties on U.S. crude,\n\nthe latest escalation in a bruising trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump said the two sides would still\n\nmeet for talks this month. Trump, writing on Twitter, said his\n\ngoal was to reduce U.S. reliance on China, and he again urged\n\nAmerican companies to find alternative suppliers outside China.\n\n\"Even as President Trump has indicated that scheduled talks\n\nbetween the U.S. and China are still to proceed, the market is\n\nmore and more resigned to a protracted standoff between the two\n\ncountries and will be looking towards central bank easing to\n\nshore up risk appetite,\" BNP Paribas' Harry Tchilinguirian said.\n\nBeijing's levy of 5% on U.S. crude marks the first time the\n\nfuel had been targeted since the world's two largest economies\n\nstarted their trade war more than a year ago. Saudi Arabia on Monday named Yasir al-Rumayyan, the head of\n\nits sovereign wealth fund, as chairman of state-run oil giant\n\nAramco, replacing Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih in the\n\nposition. Oil output in August from members of the Organization of the\n\nPetroleum Exporting Countries rose for the first month this year\n\nas higher supply from Iraq and Nigeria outweighed restraint by\n\ntop exporter Saudi Arabia and declines caused by U.S. sanctions\n\non Iran. In the United States, Hurricane Dorian was forecast to bring\n\nheavy rains and a storm surge late Monday through Wednesday to\n\nFlorida's Atlantic coast before it moves northward along the\n\ncoasts of Georgia, and the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center called for Dorian to spare the\n\nU.S. mainland a direct hit. If it remains offshore, the storm\n\nwould be unlikely to result in reduced fuel demand that\n\ntypically follows storm flooding and power outages.\n\nU.S. energy companies also cut drilling rigs for a ninth\n\nmonth in a row to the lowest level since January last year.\n\nTotal U.S. crude output fell in June for the second month in a\n\nrow, according to an Energy Department report on Friday.
