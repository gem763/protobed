Cheryl's stunning Little Black Dress teased a glimpse of her cleavage with its cut-out detail while cinching in at her slender waist\n\nThere are just 100 known cases worldwide. Sufferers face a daily fight for survival and many patients die before they reach their teens.\n\nWhen doctors confirmed Aaron had ROHHAD in January 2015, there was no test to diagnose it, little research into the illness and critically, there is no cure.\n\nMonths after being diagnosed, Aaron and his family founded the ROHHAD Association to raise awareness and money to fund research, as well as to offer support to other families and children with the syndrome.\n\nAfter seeing the Ice Bucket Challenge on the news, Aaron asked his mother if he could do something similar. He came up with the Muddy Puddle Challenge, where participants jump in puddles - something Aaron can\u2019t do due to his condition.\n\nProud: On the red carpet earlier in the evening, Cheryl posed with inspirational young award winner, Aaron Hunter, nine, who picked up the Good Morning Britain Young Fundraiser (Scotland) award\n\nYou did it!
