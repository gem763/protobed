He has invited executives from Ethereum, Litecoin, Binance, Circle, Huobi, eToro, and other crypto firms to attend, but not all have accepted.\n\nSun is working to reschedule the meal after postponing it in July, a move that sparked conspiracies he was in trouble with the Chinese government. However, finding a date that fits everyone\u2019s diaries has proven challenging.\n\n\u201cIt took about two months for us to get all nine people to come to San Francisco and sit in one room for five hours with Warren Buffett,\u201d Cliff Edwards, Tron\u2019s communications director, told Blocktv. \u201cWe are in the process of corralling all of those nine people again to get it back on track.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s everyone Sun has invited to his lunch with Buffett.\n\nDonald Trump\n\ncaption President Donald Trump. source Twitter/@realdonaldtrump\n\nJustin Sun asked Donald Trump to attend his lunch with Warren Buffett after the president criticized cryptocurrencies on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,\u201d Trump tweeted on July 12. \u201cUnregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.\u201d\n\nSun invited the president to the Buffett lunch less than three hours later.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are misled by fake news,\u201d he tweeted. \u201c#Bitcoin & #Blockchain happens to be the best chance for US!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to invite you to have lunch with crypto leaders along with @WarrenBuffett on July 25,\u201d he continued. \u201cI guarantee you after this lunch, nobody will know crypto more than you!\u201d\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t publicly responded to Sun\u2019s invite.\n\nCharlie Lee, creator of Litecoin\n\ncaption Litecoin creator Charlie Lee. source Screenshot via YouTube\n\nCharlie Lee is the creator of Litecoin, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a $4.3 billion market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.

I guess that\u2019s like turning down $1,000,000, assuming 5 guys going, lol\u2026 But very much appreciated.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zhao made time to ridicule Buffett, a vocal cryptocurrency critic who has dismissed bitcoin as \u201crat poison squared.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess Buffet will be eating a lunch funded by \u2018rat poison\u2019 after all, lol,\u201d Zhao tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be famous, people pay millions of dollars to educate you,\u201d he added in another tweet.\n\nLivio Weng, CEO of Huobi\n\ncaption Livio Weng, CEO of Huobi source YouTube/Huobi Global\n\nLivio Weng is the CEO of Huobi, a Hong Kong-listed company founded in China and run out of Singapore.
