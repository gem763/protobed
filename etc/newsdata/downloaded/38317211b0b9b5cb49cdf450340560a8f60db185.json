That and more in Trysta Krick's Week 7 overreactions. USA TODAY\n\nAaron Rodgers reminded everyone just how good he can be Sunday in the Green Bay Packers' 42-24 win over the Oakland Raiders. And it's scary good and led to him becoming the first Packers quarterback to finish with a perfect passer rating.\n\nHe was 25-for-31 for 429 yards with five passing touchdowns and added a rushing touchdown too. He stunned everyone, including his teammates, who went nuts when they learned about his passer rating.\n\nDania Patrick was pretty impressed too. The retired race car driver \u2014 who's dating Rodgers and is now one of Green Bay's biggest fans \u2014 often shares celebratory posts on Instagram following Packers' wins. Monday, her Instagram post highlighted the kind of person she says he is off the field \u2014 \"Plus the hotness!\"\n\nNFL WINNERS, LOSERS: Rodgers suddenly in MVP race\n\nNFL: 32 things we learned from Week 7 of 2019 season\n\nTo go with a photo of Rodgers and his happy teammates and one of his supporters in a suite, Danica wrote in the caption:\n\nWhile Aaron's greatness is measured and very very impressive on the field, he should also be known for the great human he is off the field. Every weekend there is a group of amazing people that fly from far and wide to support him, some new friends (many are my old friends) but most he has had for decades. Yesterday was one of those days where there was so much to celebrate beyond just being together. Perfect passer rating. Fastest QB to reach 350 TD in history. Also, a highly ranked game in passing yards and in TDs.\n\nPlus the hotness!\n\nLucky girl.\n\nLet's gooooooo!!!!\n\nShe also shared some photos on her Instagram story from the game and afterward, calling it a \"special day\" for Rodgers.\n\nInstagram screenshot:\n\nInstagram screenshot: @danicapatrick\n\nJudging by Danica's Instagram stories, it also looks like she made celebratory cupcakes for Rodgers - who, as Patrick previously told For The Win, is also a big fan of her no-bake key lime tart recipe.\n\nInstagram screenshot:\n\nInstagram screenshot: @danicapatrick\n\nPatrick is originally from Illinois and grew up in a family of Chicago Bears fans, but she has since switched allegiances to Green Bay. When she first confirmed her relationship with Rodgers back in January of 2018, she told the Associated Press that because they were friends, she had always cheered for Rodgers as a player. But she began supporting the all the Packers, adding: \"I'm going to cheer for the whole team.\"\n\nThis NFL season, Patrick has enthusiastically cheering for Rodgers and the Packers at home and away games and even before the season started when she visited training camp.\n\nWhen Danica was still racing, Rodgers similarly supported her. He was at her final races before retiring as a driver - she finished her racing career with the 2018 Daytona 500 and 2018 Indianapolis 500 - and hung out with her family on pit road before both.", "description": "Like just about everyone else, Danica was pretty impressed by Aaron Rodgers' Week 7 performance against the Oakland Raiders.", "authors": ["Michelle R.
