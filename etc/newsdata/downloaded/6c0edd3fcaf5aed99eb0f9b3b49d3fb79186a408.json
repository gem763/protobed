REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\nThe U.S. has placed multiple layers of sanctions on Russia, its senior officials and largest companies, as well as businessmen it views as connected to the Kremlin, the bulk of them linked to Moscow\u2019s role in the Ukrainian crisis which began in 2014 and has yet to be resolved.\n\nIn a column here for the Wall Street Journal published on Monday, Huntsman argued that \"sanctions have become our go-to foreign policy tool to admonish misbehaviour\" but not all of them are having the desired effect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to initiate sanctions, but it has become politically perilous to discuss removing them,\u201d Huntsman wrote.\n\n\u201cBy last count, there are almost 850 Russian individuals and entities that have been designated under various sanctions authorities, with little or no analysis measuring their efficacy.\u201d\n\nWhile many of those measures may be having the desired effect and should be maintained, not all of them do, he argued.\n\n\u201cMy embassy colleagues and I heard the same refrain over and over - that in some cases U.S. sanctions are having the opposite of their intended effect, forcing capital back to Russia, buoying Russian domestic sectors and disadvantaging U.S. businesses seeking to gain a strategic market foothold,\u201d Huntsman wrote.\n\nUnilateral sanctions won\u2019t succeed in changing the behaviour of Russian President Vladimir Putin or that of his government, Hunstman said, and leave little space for Washington to \u201ccultivate constructive relationships with those who will shape Russia\u2019s post-Putin period\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. was caught off guard by Mr. Putin\u2019s unexpected rise to power after the collapse of the Soviet Union. We can\u2019t afford to let that happen again,\u201d Huntsman wrote.\n\n\u201cSmart diplomacy thus far has managed to keep us from war, but I worry the current estrangement will limit our options for strategic engagement in the years ahead.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly criticised U.S. sanctions as counterproductive and said its own actions were in line with international law.", "description": "Days after ending his term in Moscow, former United States ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman has urged Washington to review its sanctions-dominated approach to Russia, questioning its efficiency and calling for dialogue.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438428467&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970S9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
