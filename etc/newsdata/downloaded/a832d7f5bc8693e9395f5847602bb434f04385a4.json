Cathy, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, was quoted in 2012 saying that Chick-fil-A believed in the \u201cbiblical definition of the family unit.\u201d\n\nCathy\u2019s comments came after news reports revealed that the company\u2019s foundation had donated money to groups in the United States working to prevent the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nOn Friday, Reading Pride announced that after talking with the Oracle, mall management \u201cstated they will review their selection process and ensure a more thorough check is in place.\u201d The mall did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.\n\nPhotos and video shared on Twitter of a protest on Saturday showed people holding a sign that read: \u201cGET THE CHICK OUT. Say NO to bigotry and hatred on your High Street.\u201d\n\nAsked if the chain had plans to set up elsewhere in England after its lease was up, a company spokeswoman said, \u201cWe are always looking and learning, and do so through pop-up locations, but nothing else to share right now.\u201d\n\nWhen Chick-fil-A opened a three-story, 5,000 square-foot space in midtown Manhattan in 2015, it was met by activists who stood outside the restaurant.\n\nThe Atlanta-based chain was founded by S. Truett Cathy in 1967 and it now has more than 2,400 restaurants in North America. The company opened its first international location in Toronto in September. Protesters showed up there, too.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Just days after Chick-fil-A's first restaurant in the United Kingdom opened and amid protests by activists about the company's opposition to same-sex marriage, the chain said on Saturday it will close the site in six months.The Oracle, the shopping mall in Reading, England, where the restaurant", "authors": ["Derrick Bryson Taylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2vri3AsgOeTDJ9EtLKv6mA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-312399-1571604965647.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
