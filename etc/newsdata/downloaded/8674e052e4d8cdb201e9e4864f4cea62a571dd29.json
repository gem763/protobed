Democrats are ready to instantaneously turn millions of otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals overnight for refusing to adhere to a law that retroactively transformed the exercise of a constitutional right into criminality.\n\nAnd they do it without any evidence that it would curtail rare mass shootings or save lives.\n\nWhile national confiscation would be unprecedented in American history, we already possess hard evidence that bans of assault rifles don\u2019t alter gun violence trends. Gun homicides continued to drop steeply after an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban expired in 2004. It\u2019s also worth noting that in 2017, the last year of available FBI data, there was a near-historic low of 7,032 murders with handguns, and 403 by \u201crifles\u201d of any kind, not only \u201cassault weapons.\u201d\n\nTo put that in perspective, there were 1,591 knife homicides during that same span, 467 people killed with blunt objects, and another 696 with fists and kicking. (Not every police department reports the type of gun used in homicides (3,096 of them), but it\u2019s reasonable to believe that similar trends apply, since those murders took place in big cities where handguns are most prevalent.)", "description": "", "authors": ["David Harsanyi", "Thefederalist.Com Dems-Propose-First-Gun-Grab-Since-Lexington-Concord"], "top_image": ""}
