He will be sentenced today\n\nThe mother of a little girl abducted from a Kmart store and taken into bushland where she was sexually assaulted has spoken for the first time about her child's horrific ordeal.\n\nOn the day the child's attacker, Sterling Mervyn Free, 27, is due to be sentenced, the victim's mother said no punishment will ever fit the crime committed upon her daughter.\n\nThe mother was shopping with her child at Westfield North Lakes, when Free lured the girl away.\n\n'My tiny innocent girl was well aware of stranger danger, however this person was friendly to her and tricked her into following him,' the mother said in a statement.\n\n'No child should ever have to go through this type of trauma, and no sentence will ever be long enough to make up for the ongoing effects this will have on her.'\n\n'We, as a family, remain positive and are trying to move forward. We would like to thank the Queensland Police Service, the Queensland DPP and the Australian public for their support throughout this ordeal'.\n\nAnatomy of a crime: Sterling Free (on left) abducted the girl as she milled about the toy aisle at Kmart North Lakes on December 8, 2018, while he was Christmas shopping\n\nBrisbane District Court has previously heard that the girl was milling about the toy section of the store, near her mother, when the opportunistic, Christmas-shopping predator led her away.\n\nFree took the child to his car, drove her into secluded bushland, assaulted her and then dropped her back at the shopping centre about 90 minutes later, where she was reunited with her mum.\n\nBruce Morcombe, the well-known father of the abducted and murdered boy Daniel Morcombe, told Daily Mail Australia he hopes Free's sentence will serve as a 'resounding deterrent' to predators.\n\n'It needs to be loud and clear - hands off our kids,' Mr Morcombe said.\n\n'That's what it needs to be: \"Sterling, mate, you're going to jail for a long time.\"\n\n'It needs to send a message to all Queenslanders who have a fascination with our kids: don't go there, because you'll be doing a long stretch.'\n\nMr Morcombe has a strong personal interest - not just because of what happened to his own son - as he has met the victim and her 'very loving and strong family'.\n\nA 'brazen and predatory' crime: What the judge must consider\n\nThe victim's family watched on in court earlier this week as Free faced sentencing proceedings, almost a year after confessing his crimes to police.\n\nFree - a father-of-two and Fantastic Furniture worker before to his arrest - formally admitted to three charges at the state's District Court.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to taking a child for immoral purposes, deprivation of liberty and indecent treatment of a child under 12.\n\nOn Tuesday, prosecutor Judy Geary told Judge Julie Dick to consider that there was a 'brazen, determined nature (to Free's offending)'.\n\nMs Geary told the sentencing hearing that Free's behaviour 'can only be described as predatory'.\n\nShe said that Free had 'preyed upon (the victim's) naivety and trusting nature' to lure the girl away.\n\nFree leads the little girl away, in footage shown to the court. The court heard Free lurked in the Kmart toy section corridors before telling her to 'follow me'\n\nFree worked at Fantastic Furniture and is the father of twins\n\nThere were tears in the court's public gallery as the judge was shown CCTV footage of the girl being led out of the shopping centre.\n\nThe prosecutor said the victim would have been left feeling 'completely helpless' as he took her to secluded bushland at Pumicestone Passage, about 30 minutes drive away, and assaulted her.\n\nDefence barrister Angus Edwards told reportedly the court his client's actions were appalling but said Free had demonstrated 'genuine' remorse.\n\nMr Edwards said his client had confessed his crimes to police, had pleaded guilty early and cooperated with authorities.\n\nHis client had an online porn addiction, a paedophilic disorder and poor impulse control, the judge was told.\n\nProsecutors called for Free to be handed a 10 year jail term, while Free's solicitor has said he hopes for a six-to-nine year term.\n\nThe maximum penalty is 20 years' imprisonment.\n\n'It's the simplicity of it, that's why Australians reacted to it'\n\nBruce Morcombe and his wife Denise became child protection advocates after their son Daniel was kidnapped and killed in December 2003\n\nIn an interview, Mr Morcombe said he was hoping the judge will hand down a 'resounding deterrent'.\n\n'We cannot get a slap on the wrist here because there will be copycats,' he said.\n\nThere is little doubt Free's heinous actions shocked the community.\n\nAfter his arrest, Free was kept in isolation because of a barrage of threats to his safety that were posted online.\n\nA local court magistrate also initially limited details that could be reported about the case in the press.\n\nThe circumstances of how Free snatched the victim - at a shopping mall not far from the girl's mum - had disturbing echoes of other infamous abductions, such as Mr Morcombe's own son, Daniel.\n\n(Daniel was snatched by predator Brett Peter Cowan near a bus stop in December 2003.)\n\nMr Morcombe said: 'It's the simplicity of it, I think that's why Australians reacted to it ... the brazenness of it.'\n\nNo matter what happens today, the child protection campaigner said there is one thing he is certain of.\n\n'The youngster (Free's victim) is being well cared for and the family is very strong and focused on putting their lives together,' Mr Morcombe said.\n\n'She is surrounded by help both within the family unit and is receiving counselling. She's in good hands.'", "description": "The mother of a little girl abducted from a Kmart store and taken into bushland where she was sexually assaulted has spoken for the first time about her child's horrific ordeal.", "authors": ["Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19561896-0-image-a-3_1570745828247.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
