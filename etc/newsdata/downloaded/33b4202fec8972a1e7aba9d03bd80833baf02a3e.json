He also gained more Twitter followers over the course of the debate than any other candidate.\n\nWhile some rivals on the debate stage laughed and rolled their eyes at the ploy, Yang\u2019s campaign sees the \u201cFreedom Dividend Pilot Program\u201d as an example of why their internet-first campaign has pushed them to sixth place in the crowded contest.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
