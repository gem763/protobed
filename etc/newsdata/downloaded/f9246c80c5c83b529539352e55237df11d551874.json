Creating a place where we can debate, share different opinions, and express our views is what makes our app and technologies meaningful for people all over the world.\n\nWe are proud to work for a place that enables that expression, and we believe it is imperative to evolve as societies change. As Chris Cox said, \u201cWe know the effects of social media are not neutral, and its history has not yet been written.\u201d\n\nThis is our company.\n\nWe\u2019re reaching out to you, the leaders of this company, because we\u2019re worried we\u2019re on track to undo the great strides our product teams have made in integrity over the last two years. We work here because we care, because we know that even our smallest choices impact communities at an astounding scale. We want to raise our concerns before it\u2019s too late.\n\nFree speech and paid speech are not the same thing.\n\nMisinformation affects us all. Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn\u2019t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\n\nAllowing paid civic misinformation to run on the platform in its current state has the potential to:\n\n\u2014 Increase distrust in our platform by allowing similar paid and organic content to sit side-by-side \u2014 some with third-party fact-checking and some without. Additionally, it communicates that we are OK profiting from deliberate misinformation campaigns by those in or seeking positions of power.\n\n\u2014 Undo integrity product work. Currently, integrity teams are working hard to give users more context on the content they see, demote violating content, and more. For the Election 2020 Lockdown, these teams made hard choices on what to support and what not to support, and this policy will undo much of that work by undermining trust in the platform. And after the 2020 Lockdown, this policy has the potential to continue to cause harm in coming elections around the world.\n\nProposals for improvement\n\nOur goal is to bring awareness to our leadership that a large part of the employee body does not agree with this policy. We want to work with our leadership to develop better solutions that both protect our business and the people who use our products. We know this work is nuanced, but there are many things we can do short of eliminating political ads altogether.\n\nThese suggestions are all focused on ad-related content, not organic.\n\n1. Hold political ads to the same standard as other ads.\n\na. Misinformation shared by political advertisers has an outsized detrimental impact on our community. We should not accept money for political ads without applying the standards that our other ads have to follow.\n\n2. Stronger visual design treatment for political ads.\n\na. People have trouble distinguishing political ads from organic posts. We should apply a stronger design treatment to political ads that makes it easier for people to establish context.\n\n3. Restrict targeting for political ads.\n\na. Currently, politicians and political campaigns can use our advanced targeting tools, such as Custom Audiences. It is common for political advertisers to upload voter rolls (which are publicly available in order to reach voters) and then use behavioral tracking tools (such as the FB pixel) and ad engagement to refine ads further. The risk with allowing this is that it\u2019s hard for people in the electorate to participate in the \u201cpublic scrutiny\u201d that we\u2019re saying comes along with political speech. These ads are often so micro-targeted that the conversations on our platforms are much more siloed than on other platforms. Currently we restrict targeting for housing and education and credit verticals due to a history of discrimination. We should extend similar restrictions to political advertising.\n\n4. Broader observance of the election silence periods\n\na. Observe election silence in compliance with local laws and regulations. Explore a self-imposed election silence for all elections around the world to act in good faith and as good citizens.\n\n5. Spend caps for individual politicians, regardless of source\n\na. FB has stated that one of the benefits of running political ads is to help more voices get heard. However, high-profile politicians can out-spend new voices and drown out the competition. To solve for this, if you have a PAC and a politician both running ads, there would be a limit that would apply to both together, rather than to each advertiser individually.\n\n6. Clearer policies for political ads\n\na. If FB does not change the policies for political ads, we need to update the way they are displayed. For consumers and advertisers, it\u2019s not immediately clear that political ads are exempt from the fact-checking that other ads go through. It should be easily understood by anyone that our advertising policies about misinformation don\u2019t apply to original political content or ads, especially since political misinformation is more destructive than other types of misinformation.\n\nTherefore, the section of the policies should be moved from \u201cprohibited content\u201d (which is not allowed at all) to \u201crestricted content\u201d (which is allowed with restrictions).\n\nWe want to have this conversation in an open dialog because we want to see actual change.\n\nWe are proud of the work that the integrity teams have done, and we don\u2019t want to see that undermined by policy. Over the coming months, we\u2019ll continue this conversation, and we look forward to working towards solutions together.\n\nThis is still our company.", "description": "Hundreds of Facebook employees signed a letter decrying the decision to let politicians post any claims they wanted \u2014 even false ones \u2014 in ads on the site.", "authors": ["The New York Times", "Compiled By"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/business/28facebook-letter2/28facebook-letter2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
