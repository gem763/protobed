That was the question on Kerala \u2018s lips. Now it turns out there could be more. Jolly Joseph is now being accused of committing three more murders. News channels and papers are on the hunt for potential accomplices and there is breathless coverage across mediums. The police have so far arrested two men for allegedly supplying her with cyanide but whether anyone played bigger roles remains in question. Malayalam social media has been flooded with comic memes, a lot of them sexist, featuring Jolly.\n\nIn a media saturated society like Kerala it is not uncommon to hear of crimes that holds the attention of society for weeks on end. Every year, invariably, brings with it a crime that forces Kerala society to face up to new shades of brutality within its fold. Last year, a toddler subjected to physical abuse by his stepfather died amid claims that the mother was a mute witness to the torture. There was also the lynching of a mentally challenged tribal youth accused of theft of food to sate his hunger. The political murder of a Youth Congress worker in Kannur, whose legs were slashed with rusty swords nearly 50 times by alleged CPM death squads, was another gruesome scar on the Kerala psyche.\n\nThe Koodathayi murders once again showed how, sometimes, breaking news TV can offer drama before which reality TV and soap operas or 70mm films pales. The decision by Jolly\u2019s family members\u2013 son and sister-in-law, and second husband who some media houses have already branded an accused and not even a suspect, to come on news talk shows also sent viewer interest skyrocketing. Even a next-door neighbour was roped in to give his over-the-wall account of Jolly and the family\u2019s activities over the past two decades. A hilarious aside was a young local man on a bike stopped by a reporter to evince the reaction of the village to the murders saying everyone is in a disturbed state and people had stopped trusting their family members!", "description": "One woman, six murders?
