More than you might think.\n\nChocolate is made by mixing liquid and finely ground cacao beans in a device that bears more than a passing resemblance to a cement mixer. In both cases, stirring tiny granules in a fluid results in a substance with very specific properties \u2014 for chocolate, it\u2019s a meltingly smooth mouthfeel, and for concrete, it\u2019s a cohesive, consistent texture.\n\nHowever, while physicists have studied the physics of mixing concrete, fewer have taken a close look at the forces at work in chocolate conching, as the process is called. Now a team of physicists, funded in part by Mars, the confectionary company, published a paper last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing just what happens as the ingredients of chocolate are given a stir on their way to becoming a delicious treat.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nWhen conching was invented in 1879 by Rodolphe Lindt, it could take more than a day of steady mixing for gritty chocolate to grow smooth. Today, it is a shorter process. For this study, the researchers spun cacao powder and a bit of oil in a conching machine for 40 minutes. They took photographs as the stuff went around, then added a different oil that reduces friction during the final phase, which lasted an additional 20 minutes.", "description": "Researchers delved into the physics of conching, the stirring process that transforms ground cacao into a meltingly smooth treat.", "authors": ["Veronique Greenwood"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/science/21TB-CHOCOLATE/21TB-CHOCOLATE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-21"}
