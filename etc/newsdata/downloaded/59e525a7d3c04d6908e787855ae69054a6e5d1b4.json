We were together for nearly six years and he made me the happiest man on the planet.\u2019\n\n\u2018In the end he lost his battle with addiction and depression. I guess some people don\u2019t have the armour for this world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think of him probably a hundred times a day, every day. In truth, I think of little else. I would give anything to see him again and maybe one day I will, but for now I will be grateful for the time we had together and the love we shared. \u2018It was like no other.\u2019\n\nWho was Kevin McGee and when did he marry Matt Lucas?\n\nMatt remembered his tragic late husband in an emotional Instagram tribute (Picture: Matt Lucas/Instagram)\n\nKevin was a TV producer for Carbon Media, a branch of TV company Princess Productions.\n\nHis credits included such shows as The Real Little Britain, Jump Britain, The Morning After Show and Comic Relief: Red Nose Night Live 05.\n\nHe and Matt were married in 2006 in a pantomime-themed ceremony at Home House in central London.\n\nThe pair were joined by celebrity guests including Paul O\u2019Grady, Barbara Windsor, Sir Elton John and Courtney Love for the big day, celebrating with a party in which guests dressed up in costume.\n\nWhen did Matt Lucas and Kevin McGee split?\n\nMatt and Kevin had a flamboyant wedding party with everybody in costume (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nThe couple announced in June 2008 that they had split, just 18 months after their wedding.\n\nKevin, who struggled with drug addiction and depression, was tragically found dead at his Edinburgh flat on 6 October 2009.\n\nMatt previously revealed the devastating effect Kevin\u2019s loss had had on his life, admitting he used sex to help him cope.\n\nSpeaking to the Sunday Times in 2017 Matt said: \u2018I think people respond in all different ways to grief. I thought I was very conscientious going to a bereavement counsellor and not turning to drink, which I hardly ever do \u2013 I probably have six units a year.\n\nMatt moved to the US in 2012 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not going to start smoking again, I\u2019m not going to do drugs. But I ended up eating lots and having lots of sex. That was how I responded. As much as anything I was trying to distract myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe comedian \u2013 who more recently has been seen as Nardole in Doctor Who \u2013 also moved to California in 2012 in an attempt to start afresh.\n\n\u2018I wanted to build a new life. The first thing [they say] when something as terrible as that happens is not to do anything radical,\u2019 he explained.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t immediately sell your house when someone dies, don\u2019t get a new job. But enough time had gone by for me to think now was the time to move on. I thought I had to go somewhere warm, so I went to California.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
