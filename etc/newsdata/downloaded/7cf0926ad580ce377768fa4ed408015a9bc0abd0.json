The study \u2013 entitled \u201cWhat does the next 25 years hold for global health?\u201d \u2013 offered a \u201csnapshot\u201d of opinion at a time of political uncertainty and growing inequality, the society said.\n\nDrug resistance and emerging epidemics came second and third respectively among the top concerns identified by society members polled across six continents. About 87% said governments are not investing enough to tackle all the big health challenges over this period.\n\nHowever, despite these issues, 53% of members remained optimistic about the future of global healthcare. Roughly 67% believed that polio would be eradicated, and 56% predicted guinea-worm would be gone by 2025.\n\nTamar Ghosh, chief executive of the Royal Society, said: \u201cThere can be no doubt we are facing multiple, serious health challenges, but it\u2019s easy to forget that we have made huge progress in the past 25 years and have the opportunity to take yet more great leaps forward in the next quarter of a century.\u201d\n\nExperts warn world \u2018grossly unprepared\u2019 for future pandemics Read more\n\nTechnology had improved healthcare systems, according to 97% of those polled, while two-thirds thought a new company would emerge and disrupt the way healthcare is delivered.\n\nMembers predicted the next 25 years would bring an increase in non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer. A rise in drug-resistant diseases, sexually transmitted infections and emerging infectious diseases was also predicted.\n\nThe Royal Society polled more than 600 fellows, members and the wider tropical health community across 79 countries. It launched the report at the European congress on tropical medicine and international health, held in Liverpool this week.", "description": "Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene fears medical impact of failure to prepare for global heating over next 25 years", "authors": ["Karen Mcveigh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2214b10970356d4588d8e4636b3ac9c572afc9d9/0_11_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b91c307160bd9753241a3b36e9db8237", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
