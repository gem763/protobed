I want to show the audience what female fighters can be, and I want them to accept us.\u201d\n\nIn 33-year-old American Janet Todd,Vandaryeva faces a woman who already has three fights with the promotion under her belt since making her debut this year.\n\nThe first of those was an atomweight Muay Thai world title fight against Stamp Fairtex which ended in defeat, although \u2018JT\u2019 has since picked up two victories.\n\nVandaryeva assesses her American opponent as \u201cnot a bad fighter\u2026 very technical,\u201d but believes she will use brains as well as brawn to bring her down.\n\n\u201cThe best way to deal with someone like her is by using your brain \u2013 you need to quickly analyze the situation and keep everything under control.\n\n\u201cOf course, I noticed her strong and weak points, but I am in no rush to talk about it. Often, what you find in the ring and what you see before the fight are very different things. Your opponent and the course of the fight can be a complete surprise,\u201dshe said.\n\nOne approaching danger that fighters and promoters will be wary of is that of Typhoon Hagibis, which is barrelling towards Japan and is expected to hit the mainland on Saturday.\n\nIt has already caused disruption to the Rugby World Cup and F1 Grand Prix in the country, although ONE officials have offered assurances that \u201cthere is a robust contingency program in place should our event be affected.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5 THIS SUNDAY \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5\n\nThe biggest martial arts event in history is almost here! 28 World Champions. 7 World Title bouts. 2 stacked cards. ONE: CENTURY in Tokyo! #WeAreONE#ONEChampionship#ONECenturypic.twitter.com/UyPYR3Kk7r \u2014 ONE Championship (@ONEChampionship) October 7, 2019\n\nA cancellation toVandaryeva\u2019s debut would be a bitter blow, as it would to all those on the card at such a highly-anticipated event, but the Belarusian herself has suggested that she keeps things in perspective, particularly since the birth of her son.\n\n\u201cI train, I fight, I give it all I have and then I have my other life, which has nothing to do with martial arts,\u201d she told the ONE website in the build-up to her debut.\n\n\u201cIn this other life, I do not watch fights, I do not check who is a new star, who is doing what in mixed martial arts or any other martial art.\u201d\n\nThe fighter\u2019s social media output would appear testament to that, as she shares just as many photos of life as a mother as she does doing the training that her top-level combat sports career demands.\n\nBut while her perspective may seem less obsessive than some, there is a combat sports beast behindVandaryeva\u2019s beauty \u2013 and one that will be desperate to be unleashed on the major stage on Sunday.\n\nAs the adage goes, looks can be deceiving.", "description": "As stages go for making your debut for a combat sports promotion, they don\u2019t come much bigger than ONE Championship\u2019s blockbuster event in Tokyo this weekend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da07c832030271b0f28e912.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-07"}
