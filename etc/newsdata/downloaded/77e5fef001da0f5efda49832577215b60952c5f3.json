Most recent additions were ideas to curb the US investments in China; limit pension fund investments in Chinese stocks; delisting of Chinese companies from the US exchanges. Now the Chinese companies listed in the US are exempt from some disclosure rules by the SEC [a bad idea] and that could change. Chinese stocks and ETFs fell sharply. But few of these ideas may come to fruition.\n\nCracks began to appear in the IPO market. The money-market repo market ran low on cash and the Fed started pumping liquidity in that market. Impeachment was in the news. Jobs growth has slowed \u2013 this Friday\u2019s jobs report is expected to add +150,000 when the 12-mo average is +173,000.\n\nState and local pension funds are only 52% funded. The assumed median return is high at 7.25% and many are forced to take higher risks. Stephanie Pomboy [ MacroMaven ] and Harley Bassman [ Convexity Maven ] suggest printing money or the Fed QE as solution. The new MMT may also be deployed. [tongue-in-cheek suggestions?]. Gold and real assets may benefit.\n\nPg 5, Streetwise: Many companies are burning-cash [PTON (latest IPO), SNAP, WORK, TSLA, NFLX, etc]. Percentage of IPOs now that are unprofitable is similar to that during the dot.com bubble although the overall IPO valuations are not that crazy. Instead, many companies talk about their \u201cpath to profitability\u201d several years down the road. [Piece talks about cash-burn as well as no-profits; AMZN is given as an example with no-profits but huge positive cash flows].\n\nPg 8-9: The Fed holds \u201cFed Listens\u201d event in DC on Friday.\n\nGoogle Maps and Waze are growth drivers for Alphabet [GOOGL].\n\nTesla [TSLA] is expected to release production and deliveries data next week. The Q3 earnings estimates range from loss to profit. Some investors are moving beyond Q3.\n\nData this week: Chicago PMI, Dallas Fed Texas manufacturing outlook on Monday; construction spending on Tuesday; ADP employment report on Wednesday; ISM nonmanufacturing index, factory orders on Thursday; international trade deficit, jobs report [+140,000 to +150,000], unemployment rate [3.7%] on Friday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: American Airlines [AAL; yield 1.5%; fwd P/E 5; buybacks; high debt; future capex to be down; issues with union, customers, grounded Boeing 737 MAX have hurt; BRK/Buffett owns 10%; industry has consolidated; pg 12];\n\nChipotle [CMG; has recovered under new CEO Brian Nichol (from Taco Bell ) since 2018; increased emphasis on technology, food processing (extra washing; blanching of some raw foods) and preparation; new stores opening at slower pace to ensure quality; not a fan of alt-meats that are made to taste like meat \u2013 CMG meat alternative is organic tofu; pg 14].\n\nBearish Recommendations: None self standing\n\nPg 10: The IPO market has corrected. After several disappointments, the IPOs have become less frothy and more rational. Weak IPOs have been money-losing consumer-oriented companies [UBER, LYFT, WORK, SDC, PTON]. Strong IPOs have been in enterprise/cloud areas [BYND, ZM, CRWD, FSLY, MDLA, NET, PD, DDOG] and 63/114 IPOs still have positive returns. Withdrawn IPO of WeWork / WeCo may have changed the sentiment. Direct-listings have also been successful as alternatives to traditional IPOs.\n\nPg 25: Selloff in IPOs [UBER, LYFT, PINS, CHWY, PTON] has created some buying opportunities [WORK]; WeWork / WeCo IPO couldn\u2019t proceed at sharply lower valuations and it has changed its management. The IPO window may have closed for growth-at-all-costs.\n\nPg 15: German GDP contracted in Q2 and expectations are for continued contraction in Q3 and Q4 [so, Germany would be in recession soon]; manufacturing [22% of economy] is down -8%; export growth is flat; trade surplus is high; annual budget surplus is 2% of GDP. Since German unification, it has emphasized exports over domestic consumption; domestic savings rate is high [ironically, people have to save more when rates are so low]. There is now an opportunity for Germany to drastically change its economic model.\n\nPg 16: Cover Story, \u201cThe Future of Biotech: Our Roundtable Experts Pick 15 Promising Stocks\u201d This may be a golden age for biotech innovations but there have been outflows from biotech funds and the biotech index is down -25% from mid-2015 peak. There have been many biotech IPOs, some drug disappointments and drug pricing has become an issue. Biotech stocks are very volatile. Elections create additional uncertainty on regulations. Challenges remain in moving from labs to production and distribution. Several startups and smaller companies get acquired by more established companies.\n\nGabol Amusa, Chardan Capital : RGNX, QURE, KRYS, MGTX, MDCO, KOD\n\nZiad Bakri, PRHSX: VTRX, ASND, TCDA\n\nEli Casdin, Casdin Capital : BLFS, MGTA, NVTA, MYOK\n\nDavid Schenkein, GV -GOOGL: Verve , Beam , Verana\n\nGena Wang, Barclays : RGNX, SRPT\n\nBiotech ETF IBB\n\nBiotech OEFs FBIOX, FBDIX, PRHSX, VGHCX\n\nPg 26: John Malooly of small-cap growth WAMCX looks for strong management; disruptive potential or competitive advantage; catalysts; valuations. The fund can have up to 30% in foreign stocks [now only 10%].\n\nPg 28: ETFs have so far relied on uneven and ad-hoc exemptions from the SEC. The SEC has now adopted the ETF Rule 6c-11 that sort of broadens the ICA 1940 to ETFs. There will be a 1-yr transition period. Leveraged and inverse ETFs will not be covered.\n\nPg 29: Income. Shareholder yield is the sum of dividend yield [money in investors\u2019 pockets] and buyback yield [to support the stock prices]. Some buybacks just offset the dilution from stock options and grants. The highest shareholder yields are for financials and IT; the lowest for communication services and utilities. In Q2 for the SP500, the buybacks [$165 billion] well exceeded the dividend payouts [$119 billion].\n\nPg 30: Jim Grant, Current Yield. Austrian 100-yr, 2.1% bonds have doubled [0.7% YTM] since they were issued in September 2017; if the rates become 0% YTM, they would triple. But the reverse could happen: If the rates move to 1%, their price would be 168, at 2% 104, at 4% 54, and of course par at maturity. Demand from the ECB and bond index funds is not sensitive to bond prices. The ECB is aggressively easing [negative rates; QE] and is open to looking at the new MMT.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nOctober has been a bad month for stocks, especially in pre-election years. October is also the end of poor seasonality [May-October].\n\nBeyond Meat [BYND] is the most expensive stock to borrow and it has moved sharply against the shorts. The shorts are also losing money on ZM, TELL, EOLS, OSTK, etc.\n\nSo long as impeachment remains in the news, stock volatility will be higher and bond yields and inflation expectations will be lower. The uncertainty will be deflationary. Futures traders may sell stocks to buy bonds. There have been only 3 past impeachments [Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon (who resigned before the proceedings could begin), Bill Clinton]. Consider buying VXX, USMV, IEF.\n\nWhite House is considering limiting portfolio inflows into China; limiting the weights of Chinese companies in broad indexes; possible delisting of Chinese companies from the US exchanges. This affected the China ETF MCHI and the EM ETF EEM [32% in China]. There was skepticism about these policies materializing as they would require formal legislation from the Congress. Chinese direct investments in the US have already fallen by 80%.\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 3, Up & Down Wall Street: Bull markets climb a wall of worry and that wall is getting bigger.
