As many as 30 million men have ED, which is defined as trouble getting or maintaining an erection firm enough for sex.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for all men to experience erection problems from time to time. ED, however, is progressive or happens frequently, mostly in middle aged and older men. The condition is linked to neurological, hormonal, and other causes, including:\n\nHeart/artery problems (heart disease, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure)\n\nBlood sugar issues (diabetes, metabolic syndrome)\n\nObesity\n\nNeurological conditions (Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis)\n\nLow levels of testosterone\n\nUse of certain medications, alcohol, and tobacco\n\nED can also result from injury to nerves or arteries that control erections, and certain medical treatments such as prostate surgery or radiation therapy. Even psychological concerns like anxiety, depression, or stress can affect erections.\n\nAddressing underlying causes\u2014and eliminating risk factors like tobacco, alcohol, and medications\u2014can solve some cases of ED. If not, or if extra help is needed, erectile dysfunction drugs (Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, etc.) are available. These medications enhance the effects of nitric oxide\u2014a compound naturally produced by the body that relaxes muscles, including those in the penis. When this happens, it allows blood flow to increase to the penis, which makes getting and maintaining erections a lot easier.\n\nA Genetic Link\n\nBut what if there was more to ED than treating it after it\u2019s already become a problem? What if you could prevent it from happening in the first place? New research indicates that for up to 1/3 of ED cases, prevention may be a viable option\u2014because a genetic link has been discovered.\n\nIn a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, researchers found that a variation near a specific gene called SIM1 was in fact associated with a 26% higher risk of ED.\n\nThe SIM1 gene is part of a signaling pathway that\u2019s involved in sexual function, among other processes. Researchers believe that the variant linked to ED, located near the SIM1 gene, influences the expression of that gene.\n\nA press release written about this study notes that the research \u201chighlights the potential of SIM1 as a target for the development of new treatments for erectile dysfunction, which are needed because about half of all men who try currently available pharmaceutical treatments for erectile dysfunction don\u2019t respond to them.\u201d\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nBeyond Viagra\n\nThis research is still in its infancy. In due time, we\u2019ll hopefully have a solution that addresses this potential root cause of ED, in turn helping many millions of men. Until that time, though, what are the best, most reliable treatment options?\n\nWell, you can certainly try the medications\u2014but as the study authors noted, half the men who take them don\u2019t respond. Plus, they\u2019re very expensive (although generics are finally being released) and can come with side effects ranging from headaches and upset stomach, to fainting, vision and hearing loss.\n\nIf Viagra and the like don\u2019t work for you, there are alternative treatments.\n\nOne is injecting similar drugs directly into the penis, which dilates local arteries to help promote erections. Yes, the thought of inserting a needle into the base of the penis is enough to make most men cringe, but it\u2019s not nearly as painful as you\u2019d think. For those who just can\u2019t do it though, these drugs are also available as urethral suppositories, though they tend to be less effective.\n\nVacuum erection devices (\u201cpenis pumps\u201d) are another option. You insert your penis in a cylinder, which sucks the air out of the tube and in turn draws blood into the penis. A constriction band around the base of the penis helps maintain the erection.\n\nIf testosterone levels are low, testosterone replacement therapy may also help. Erections depend on testosterone, and treating deficiencies can boost libido, mood, and confidence and renew interest in sex. This alone can enhance erections in some men. Testosterone replacement therapies require a prescription, so work with a doctor knowledgeable in hormone replacement therapy. Get your levels tested periodically, and adjust dosing as needed.\n\nAnd finally, a few key supplements are worth a try. The following have been well studied in the treatment of ED and low testosterone:\n\nAshwagandha is an adaptogenic herb that has been used traditionally to reduce the effects of stress and anxiety. Not only does it help relax the mind (which helps encourage stronger erections), it also has aphrodisiac properties. And studies show that it can boost testosterone levels by up to 127% in as little as 90 days. Aim for 675 mg daily.\n\nis an adaptogenic herb that has been used traditionally to reduce the effects of stress and anxiety.

Sometimes called \u201cthe natural Viagra,\u201d L-arginine works by increasing nitric oxide levels and as a result, relaxing blood vessels throughout the body, including the penis. L-arginine is found in red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy, but you can also take it in supplement form. You can also supplement with L-citrulline, another amino acid that the body converts to L-arginine. The recommended starting dosage of L-arginine is 2 grams daily. If you choose to take L-citrulline, start with 1.5 grams daily.\n\nis an amino acid that the body produces naturally.

Vitamin D3 is usually referred to as the sunshine vitamin because the body produces it with the help of ultraviolet radiation from the sun. However, most Americans are deficient in D. In men, low levels are linked to low testosterone and reduced sex drive. In a study that evaluated whether vitamin D supplementation influenced testosterone levels in 165 otherwise healthy men, researchers discovered that taking 3,332 IU daily for one year significantly increased levels of the vitamin and Dosing for D3 (the preferred form of vitamin D) varies depending on your blood levels, so work with your doctor to determine your current status and how much you should be taking. For severe deficiencies, you can safely take up to 10,000 IU daily, but for most people, 1,000\u20135,000 IU should suffice.\n\nis usually referred to as the sunshine vitamin because the body produces it with the help of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.

DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a \u201cprecursor\u201d hormone that contributes to the creation of other sex hormones, including testosterone. Levels of DHEA decline starting around age 30. Supplementing with DHEA can help boost testosterone. Try 25\u201350 mg daily, depending on your size, and aim for a lab test result of 250 mg in your system. Do not take DHEA if you have cardiovascular problems.\n\nIntimacy is an important part of a healthy relationship. Of course, there are countless ways to express love and physical attraction, but most men would agree that sex is at the top of that list. Fortunately for those who suffer from ED, science is getting closer to discovering causes that lie deep within, which will hopefully lead to a permanent solution in the near future. For now, though, there are plenty of safe, natural, and effective supplements and treatments that can allow you to enjoy a healthy and satisfying sex life.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
