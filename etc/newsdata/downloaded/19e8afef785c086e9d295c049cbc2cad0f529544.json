(Phelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press)\n\nKansas City Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill was treated at a Jacksonville hospital Sunday after sustaining a shoulder injury during a season-opening win over the Jaguars.\n\nHill had a \u201csternoclavicular joint injury which is where your clavicle comes into your sternum,\u201d Rick Burkholder, the team\u2019s head athletic trainer, said in a statement issued by the team. \u201cThose can be injured coming out the front, up top or in the back. If it goes posteriorly or back, it becomes a medical issue for us so that we worry that there\u2019s more problems.\n\n\u201cHis came back posteriorly and he didn\u2019t have any medical issues, but we still transported him to Baptist Medical Center and we turned his care over to Brett Frykberg, who is an ortho-trauma physician.\u201d\n\nThe sternoclavicular joint lies between the collarbone and the sternum and an injury to it can be dangerous. As Dr. David Geier explained when Ben Roethlisberger was injured in 2012: \u201cAn anterior dislocation of this joint means that the collarbone has popped out in front of the sternum. A posterior dislocation means that the collarbone has gone behind the sternum. While both types of dislocations are very serious, a posterior dislocation can be a surgical emergency, as the end of the collarbone becomes extremely close to the airway and large blood vessels of the heart and chest.\u201d\n\nHill will reportedly not need surgery on his collarbone injury but \u201cwill miss a few weeks,\" ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter reported.\n\nIt was a physical season opener, with Jaguars quarterback Nick Foles injuring his shoulder in the first quarter and Jaguars linebacker Myles Jack being ejected. Hill had caught two passes for 16 yards before being injured on a tackle by Jalen Ramsey after an eight-yard gain.\n\n[Nick Foles suffers broken collarbone in Jaguars debut]\n\nThe injury to Hill marked a tough opening half for the Chiefs, who watched Mahomes briefly limp off the field in the first quarter. But the reigning NFL MVP quarterback was out only briefly, returning with his ankle taped. The Chiefs said he had a sprained ankle.\n\nOnly last week, Hill and the Chiefs agreed to a three-year, $54-million contract extension that placed him among the highest-paid receivers in the NFL and came after a tumultuous offseason.\n\nIn July, the NFL announced that it would not suspend Hill over allegations that he abused his 3-year-old son. Hill and his fiancee, Crystal Espinal, were the subject of an investigation in Johnson County, Kan., over injuries suffered by their son in March. Authorities did not file charges in the case, though Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe said he believed a crime had been committed.\n\nHill called the allegations false and told reporters that he was \u201cworking every day to be a better father, a better person, a better citizen, a better teammate and a better son, too, to my parents.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nRandy Moss tells Antonio Brown it\u2019s time to \u2018put up or shut up\u2019\n\nLamar Jackson and the Ravens looked great.
