(Bill Feig/AP Photo)\n\nThe Cowboys, who have looked every bit like a legitimate Super Bowl contender in the first three weeks of this season, face the New Orleans Saints on Sunday night. Follow along here for live updates.\n\nIn-game updates\n\nHalftime: The offenses didn\u2019t do much in the first half at the Superdome. The Saints got three field goals by kicker Wil Lutz and lead the Cowboys, 9-3. Lutz\u2019s third field goal came as time expired in the half after the Saints took a risk by running a play from the Dallas 1-yard line with four seconds remaining. Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater threw an incompletion on a high throw out of bounds, but only two seconds came off the clock. The Cowboys committed a pair of first-half turnovers, on fumbles lost by tight end Jason Witten and running back Ezekiel Elliott, and have managed only a single field goal and 115 yards of total offense. Elliott has been limited to 27 rushing yards while quarterback Dak Prescott has thrown for 81 yards. Bridgewater threw an interception during a first half in which he connected on 14 of 19 passes for 124 yards. (Saints 9, Dallas 3 at halftime)\n\n\n\nWil Lutz on Sunday.

The Cowboys converted, but Ezekiel Elliott lost a fumble at the end of the run. The Saints take over on the Cowboys\u2019 half of the field with about a minute and a half to play in the first half. (Saints 6, Cowboys 3 with 1:20 left in the second quarter.)\n\nWitten fumbles: Cowboys tight end Jason Witten lost a fumble on a run after a catch. The Saints recovered and take over at their own 47-yard line. There hasn\u2019t been much offense so far. Each team has committed a turnover and there hasn\u2019t been a touchdown in the game. (Saints 6, Cowboys 3 with 7:06 left in the 2nd quarter.)\n\nAnother FG for Saints: It\u2019s a field goal-fest at the Superdome. The Saints have the lead after kicker Wil Lutz\u2019s second field goal of the night, a 42-yarder. Teddy Bridgewater is off to a decent start, other than his tipped-ball interception. He has completed eight of 10 passes for 84 yards. (Saints 6, Cowboys 3 with 8:42 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\nSaints draw even: The Saints pulled even on a 40-yard field goal by kicker Wil Lutz on the opening play of the second quarter. The promising drive stalled with a penalty for an illegal block and a sack. Earlier, the Saints were moving the ball on the ground. Alvin Kamara had a 13-yard run. Taysom Hill took over for Teddy Bridgewater for a play and went 18 yards with a quarterback keeper. And Deonte Harris went 10 yards on an end-around. (Cowboys 3, Saints 3 with 14:55 left in the 2nd quarter)\n\n1st Quarter\n\nCowboys get FG: The Cowboys have the early lead in New Orleans after kicker Brett Maher connected on a 28-yard field goal. (Cowboys 3, Saints 0 with 5:08 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nBridgewater throws interception: With Drew Brees standing on the Saints\u2019 sideline with his surgically repaired right thumb in a brace, fill-in starter Teddy Bridgewater threw an interception on the first New Orleans possession of the night. It wasn\u2019t completely Bridgewater\u2019s fault, though. He rolled to his right out of trouble and zipped a high pass to Ted Ginn Jr., who had the ball bounce off his hands while being hit. The Cowboys\u2019 Chidobe Awuzie grabbed the football on the carom. The Cowboys get the ball back after punting on the game\u2019s opening possession. (Cowboys 0, Saints 0 with 8:42 left in the 1st quarter)\n\nPreview\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys have looked every bit like a legitimate Super Bowl contender in the first three weeks of this season. They\u2019ll try to continue to resemble that Sunday night in New Orleans in a demanding road matchup with another would-be NFC heavyweight.\n\nThis \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d affair is not quite as star-studded as it could have been, given the absence of quarterback Drew Brees from the Saints\u2019 lineup while he recovers from thumb surgery. But the Saints are coming off an impressive road victory at Seattle orchestrated by fill-in starter Teddy Bridgewater and, as they return home to the Superdome, they still represent a formidable test for the Cowboys.\n\nThe Cowboys seek to improve their record to 4-0. They\u2019ve had everything clicking so far on offense and their first-year coordinator, Kellen Moore, quickly has established himself as a rising star in the coaching ranks. The Cowboys were ranked in the top four in the league in every major offensive category entering this week\u2019s play. They were third in total offense and fourth in scoring offense. They were third in rushing offense and fourth in passing offense.\n\n[This NFL season has been filled with injuries and controversies. Viewers are tuning in.]\n\nQuarterback Dak Prescott has been terrific and has established himself as a league MVP candidate. He has thrown for 920 yards and nine touchdowns through three games and has a passer rating of 128.0. The Cowboys are yet to sign him to a contract extension, even with the market having been set by the lucrative deals signed by his fellow 2016 draftees, the Los Angeles Rams\u2019 Jared Goff and the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Carson Wentz. Perhaps Prescott is in no hurry. The price tag, it seems, continues to increase.\n\nCowboys at Saints\n\nWhen: Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Eastern\n\nWhere: Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans\n\nTV: NBC\n\nStreaming: NBC Sports, Yahoo Sports, fuboTV\n\nWide receiver Amari Cooper was tied for the NFL lead with four touchdown catches through Week 3. Running back Ezekiel Elliott has had consecutive 100-yard rushing performances after being eased into the offense in Week 1 following his holdout from training camp and the preseason. The Cowboys had two 100-yard rushers, Elliott and Tony Pollard, in their Week 3 triumph over the winless Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe Saints will need a better performance from their defense. They began this week\u2019s play ranked 28th in the NFL in total defense and 26th in scoring defense. That old-style Saints\u2019 formula of winning with Brees and the offense covering for an underperforming defense won\u2019t work during a season in which Brees is in the midst of being sidelined for an estimated six weeks. The Saints had gotten away from that in recent seasons, constructing a more balanced roster with an improved defense and a more productive running game.\n\nThey\u2019re likely to lean heavily in this game on tailback Alvin Kamara. He touched the ball 25 times in the win over the Seahawks, with 16 rushing attempts and nine catches. Bridgewater will have to find a way to get wide receiver Michael Thomas more involved. Thomas had a modest five catches for 54 yards in Seattle.\n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Coach Sean Payton find a more meaningful role in the offense in this game for Taysom Hill, the valuable all-purpose player who became the backup quarterback when Brees got hurt. The Saints, with a record of 2-1 and trying to remain in contention until Brees returns, might need that something extra in this matchup.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nAntonio Brown set to file grievances to pursue lost money from Raiders, Patriots\n\nThe NFL\u2019s search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: Head Coach of the Defense", "description": "It\u2019s a marquee matchup of NFC contenders on \"Sunday Night Football\" from New Orleans, although the absence of Drew Brees dims the star power a bit.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Pm", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
