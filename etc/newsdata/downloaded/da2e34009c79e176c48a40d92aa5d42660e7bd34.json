Getty\n\n\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" star Alex Borstein took home the Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series during the annual awards ceremony Sunday night. The comedian gave a moving acceptance speech, telling the story of her grandmother, who survived the Holocaust.\n\nBorstein, who portrays Maisel's fiery manager Susie Myerson in the Amazon hit, began her speech with a joke about her 2018 Emmy attire. Last year, she accepted her Emmy for the same category without a bra on \u2014 and got backlash from some for the move.\n\n\"I know a lot of people were upset last year, 'cause I wasn't wearing a bra,\" she riffed to laughter from the audience. \"So, I want to apologize because tonight I'm not wearing any underwear. So, you're going to want to just throw that chair out or clean it pretty good.\"\n\nShe continued the speech and dedicated the award to \"the strength of a woman\" \u2014 show runner Amy Sherman-Palladino, as well as \"every woman\" on the show's cast and crew.\n\nThe actress also dedicated the Emmy to her mother and grandmother, both of whom are Holocaust survivors and immigrants. In an emotional moment, Borstein told the story of how her grandmother survived with an act of defiance.\n\n\"My grandmother turned to a guard, she was in line to be shot into a pit, and she said, 'What happens if I step out of line?'\" she recalled. \"And he said, 'I don't have the heart to shoot you, but somebody will.' And she stepped out of line. And for that I am here and for that my children are here.\"\n\n\"I dedicate this to the strength of a woman.\" #MrsMaisel star Alex Borstein (@AlexBorstein) dedicates her #Emmys win for best supporting actress in a comedy to the women in her life \u2013 including her grandmother who survived the Holocaust https://t.co/WmT1Fmyol4 pic.twitter.com/GQfUR41UL5 \u2014 Hollywood Reporter (@THR) September 23, 2019\n\nShe also used the tale to encourage other women. \"So, step out of line, ladies,\" she said. \"Step out of line.\"\n\nBorstein wasn't the only person to use the platform afforded by the Emmy stage Sunday night.
