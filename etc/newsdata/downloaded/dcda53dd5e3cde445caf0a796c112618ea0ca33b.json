REUTERS/Henry Romero\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed union freedoms, higher wages and other labor rights in his bid to assuage the concerns of U.S. congressional Democrats, who hold the key to ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\nBut as he concluded his visit to Mexico, Richard E. Neal, who leads the Ways and Means Committee in the United States\u2019 lower house of Congress, suggested Democrats were still not satisfied.\n\n\u201cOur meeting with President Lopez Obrador shed further light on the Mexican government\u2019s desire and intentions to carry out its labor justice reform, but the United States needs to see those assurances put into action,\u201d Neal said in a statement.\n\nIt was unclear precisely what steps Neal would like to see.\n\nDuring its time in Mexico, the U.S. delegation zeroed in on the labor reform passed by Lopez Obrador\u2019s left-leaning government last year, examining the funding set aside to implement the law, according to the statement.\n\nThe USMCA, which would replace the $1 trillion North American Free Trade Agreement, risks getting bogged down in the 2020 U.S. presidential election race if U.S. lawmakers do not ratify it soon.\n\nThe deal was negotiated last year after U.S. President Donald Trump said the existing North American Free Trade Agreement was unfavorable to U.S workers and businesses.\n\nLopez Obrador called for ratification as soon as possible in his morning news conference ahead of the meeting and pledged to enforce the labor reform.\n\n\u201cThe reform is so that ... workers can freely choose their representatives, and so there is union democracy and better wages,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the meeting Jesus Seade, Mexico\u2019s deputy foreign minister for North America, said he expected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move ahead with the USMCA by early November.\n\nSeade has been leading negotiations with U.S. officials seeking to placate Democratic concerns about enforcement in the new deal.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Representative Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, urged Democrats to move quickly.\n\n\u201cWith election year politics upon us, time isn\u2019t on our side. But the window of opportunity hasn\u2019t closed yet. Democrats must act now,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\nMexico\u2019s Congress has already approved the deal. It also needs ratification from Canadian lawmakers.\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters the next three weeks would be a \u201cdecisive phase\u201d for the pact, and that officials would send U.S. lawmakers a document next week detailing the issues discussed on Tuesday, including Mexico\u2019s labor reform.\n\nAn impeachment inquiry into Trump, which some fear could further delay passage of the USMCA, was not discussed with the delegation, Seade said. Seade has previously taken the view that the inquiry should in fact spur lawmakers to act on USMCA, and Pelosi has said it should not obstruct the deal.\n\nU.S. trade groups on Tuesday pressed lawmakers to approve the deal and not allow the inquiry to postpone it.\n\nAnn Wilson, chief lobbyist for the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, said the industry had delayed key investments given continued uncertainty a year after the agreement was signed by the three countries\u2019 leaders.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to waste. We need to get it done,\u201d she said.\n\nDemocrats are seeking better mechanisms in the trade agreement to ensure enforcement of labor and environmental provisions. One measure under consideration is providing aid to Mexico to beef up enforcement of labor rules.\n\nU.S. Congressman Bill Pascrell, another member of the delegation to Mexico, suggested all sides were getting closer to an agreement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all got to get our act together, and we\u2019re moving, we\u2019re making progress,\u201d he told Reuters after the meeting with Lopez Obrador.", "description": "The leader of a U.S. congressional delegation to Mexico said on Tuesday that Mexico must take more concrete steps to implement its labor reform, after a trip aimed at speeding up ratification of the new North American free trade deal.", "authors": ["Anthony Esposito", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438533075&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970WN", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
