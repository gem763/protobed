I didn't know what to think,' Edith said.\n\nFamily: Edith Garcia, 33, (pictured) from California gave birth to her youngest daughter, Tatiana, in June 2014\n\nSurprise: The mom and her husband, Raul, are both of Mexican-American descent. They were shocked by Tatiana's bright blonde hair and ivory skin\n\nConfused: 'When Tatiana was born, all I could see was this very fair-skinned baby girl with really blonde hair. I didn't know what to think,' Edith said\n\nShe confessed to first thinking her husband, Raul, who is also of Mexican-American descent couldn't possibly be the father because of how their daughter looked.\n\n'For a split second, I looked over to my husband and wondered what he did but clearly, it doesn't work that way. So naturally, I questioned my own decisions,' Edith said.\n\nJoking around: The mom (pictured when pregnant) confessed to thinking potentially Tatiana wasn't hers or her husbands because of her color\n\n'Personally, I find it funny because I know neither of us would have done such thing but when you look at a blonde baby that comes out of a brown Mexican American mother, you wonder, even if it's yourself.'\n\nIt turned out that they both had inherited the albinism gene and that some of their distant relatives have the condition.\n\nAfter doing some thorough research from the National Organisation for Albinism and Hypopigmentation, they found solace in other families going through the same thing.\n\n'After she was born, my mother asked my grandfather if he knew of any relatives and he confirmed that there were, but they were at least five generations back,' she said. 'My husband's side was similar, distant cousins but not close enough to have known the possibilities.'\n\nTatiana's albinism means that she has little to no pigmentation which has left her with white hair and fair skin.\n\nDue to her condition, Tatiana has a lack of pigmentation in her eyes, which means she has poor vision and a low depth perception. She has nystagmus, involuntary eye movement, and photophobia, which is light and glare sensitivity.\n\n'I think every time she tries to do something for the first time (physical tasks) is pretty special to see. When she was two-and-a-half years old she was climbing at an indoor playground, using her strength to lift herself up. At that point it wasn't about her vision, it was about her own determination,' Edith said.\n\n'She was going to keep up with her big sister Mariah and the other kids around her. She has always been a determined child.'\n\nPortrait time: But Edith and Raul (pictured with their two daughters) discovered they had the albinism gene in their families, which contributed to Tatiana being born with albinism\n\nHer struggle: Due to her condition, Tatiana has a lack of pigmentation in her eyes which means she has poor vision, a low depth perception\n\nPushing on: She has nystagmus, involuntary eye movement, and photophobia, which is light and glare sensitivity\n\nSister goals: Tatiana has an older sister named Mariah, five, who helps her sister and sometimes wears a special shirt to let people know about the younger sister's condition\n\nDespite strangers giving them judgmental looks when out with Tatiana and her older sister, five-year-old Mariah, Edith says that Tatiana is used to it by now and has been given unconditional support from her sister, who sometimes wears shirts that state that her sister has albinism.\n\n'I felt proud and emotional seeing my little girl trying her best, being fearless and unstoppable is as good as it gets,' she said.\n\n'Tatiana knows that she is special. She is used to the attention that she gets from strangers and doesn't seem to mind it.\n\n'She knows it's mostly because of her white hair as that is what usually people say. I think it's important too for her to feel confident and know that she is special in her own way but still the same. So far, it seems like she gets it.'\n\nFor the most part everyone is genuinely shocked and fascinated by her hair color\n\nEdith continued: 'Mariah was four years old when she really started to notice people staring at her sister and asked why. I explained to her that a lot of people haven't seen a little girl with white hair and that is very special.\n\n'She is a great help to her little sister. We often remind her that Tatiana may need help transitioning to new locations. Mariah has had shirts stating that her little sister has albinism.'\n\nAs Tatiana was born just a day before National Albinism Awareness, which is on June 13, Edith read many emotional stories based on people who have the condition, and this motivated her to try to spread awareness of albinism on Instagram.\n\n'Everyone is always shocked to see Tatiana with such noticeable white hair. She has so much of it too, it can totally pass as a wig,' she said.\n\n'I often get asked if it is her real hair color or if Tatiana's dad looks like her. For the most part everyone is genuinely shocked and fascinated by her hair color.'\n\nUnique: 'Tatiana knows that she is special,' Edith said. 'She is used to the attention that she gets from strangers and doesn't seem to mind it'\n\nRaising awareness: Edith decided to open up about Tatiana's condition on Instagram and other platforms to better inform the public about albinism\n\nPriorities: 'I will do everything in my power to raise awareness for Tatiana and every person that follows her,' Edith said\n\nSomething to think about: Edith hoped people be aware of albinism but not judge Tatiana solely on her looks instead of her character\n\nEdith continued: 'But once in a while I get the very judgmental looks and the snarky questions, but it doesn't really bother me; every party has a pooper.\n\n'I don't think her peers fully understand what it means to have albinism as they are only three years old, but I make sure that they learn about it with a home-made book about albinism and Tatiana.\n\n'I quickly learned that albinism was not very common amongst us and not a lot of people, including myself knew, anything about it.\n\n'I have read and seen some very heart-breaking things towards people with albinism and that's when it clicked.\n\n'I will do everything in my power to raise awareness for Tatiana and every person that follows her. We are in this albinism community and together we will raise awareness.'\n\nEdith hoped sharing Tatiana's story can help better inform people about those with albinism.\n\n'I believe everything happens for a reason so being a mama to a little girl with albinism has always been God's plan,' she said. 'I have made it a point to teach anyone that comes across as interested and eager to learn with the continuous support of our friends and family.\n\n'I think it's cute that she feels beautiful and knows how special she is but it is more important that she knows her inner beauty. While everyone can compliment her hair or looks, I will be behind the scenes telling her how smart, strong, and kind she is.\n\n'Research. Ask questions and become aware of albinism or any condition and how it affects people. Everyone is different and can be affected differently.\n\n'They do not have red eyes, it is the blood vessels that are visible due to the lack of pigmentation. Remember that they're born this way. They don't know any different. Identify their strengths and work on their difficulties, support them.'", "description": "Edith Garcia, 33, from California gave birth to her youngest daughter, Tatiana, in June 2014.
