We studied. Last couple of weeks we haven\u2019t been able to get that rolling \u2026 nine sacks later, we got the job done.\u201d\n\nMoore completed 10 of 19 passes for 117 yards with a touchdown and LeSean McCoy rushed for 64 yards on 12 carries.\n\nAfter Freeman\u2019s touchdown was followed by a failed two-point conversion attempt, Mahomes connected with Mecole Hardman for a 21-yard touchdown on the Chiefs\u2019 first possession for a 7-6 advantage.\n\nAfter two Harrison Butker field goals, Anthony Hitchens stripped Joe Flacco on a sack which was recovered by Reggie Ragland and returned for a 5-yard touchdown to extend the Chiefs\u2019 lead.\n\nMoore hit Tyreek Hill for a 57-yard touchdown in the third quarter and Butker added a third field goal in the fourth.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you respond,\u201d Clark said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great backup in Matt Moore. He came in and led our team to the victory.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 The Kansas City Chiefs snapped a two-game skid Thursday but their 30-6 NFL victory against the Broncos in Denver may have come", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/7db701_kansas-city-quarterback-patrick-mahomes-is-helped-off-field-injuring-his-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
