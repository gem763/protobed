The power companies in turn fault the state for so over-regulating utilities that they had no resources to modernize their grids.\n\nCalifornians know that having tens of thousands of homeless in their major cities is untenable. In some places, municipal sidewalks have become open sewers of garbage, used needles, rodents and infectious diseases. Yet no one dares question progressive orthodoxy by enforcing drug and vagrancy laws, moving the homeless out of cities to suburban or rural facilities, or increasing the number of mental hospitals.\n\nTaxpayers in California, whose basket of sales, gasoline and income taxes is the highest in the nation, quietly seethe while immobile on antiquated freeways that are crowded, dangerous and under nonstop makeshift repair.\n\nGas prices of $4 to $5 a gallon \u2014 the result of high taxes, hyper-regulation and green mandates \u2014 add insult to the injury of stalled commuters. Gas tax increases ostensibly intended to fund freeway expansion and repair continue to be diverted to the state\u2019s failing high-speed rail project.\n\nResidents shrug that the state\u2019s public schools are among weakest in the nation, often ranking in the bottom quadrant in standardized test scores. Elites publicly oppose charter schools but often put their own kids in private academies.\n\nCalifornians know that to venture into a typical municipal emergency room is to descend into a modern Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno.\u201d Medical facilities are overcrowded. They can be as unpleasant as they are bankrupting to the vanishing middle class that must face exorbitant charges to bring in an injured or sick child.\n\nNo one would dare to connect the crumbling infrastructure, poor schools and failing public health care with the non-enforcement of immigration laws, which has led to a massive influx of undocumented immigrants from the poorest regions of the world, who often arrive without fluency in English or a high school education.\n\nStores are occasionally hit by swarming looters. Such Wild West criminals know how to keep their thefts under $950, ensuring that such \u201cmisdemeanors\u201d do not warrant police attention. California\u2019s permissive laws have decriminalized thefts and break-ins. The result is that San Francisco now has the highest property crime rate per capita in the nation.\n\nHas California become premodern?\n\nMillions of fed-up middle-class taxpayers have fled the state. Their presence as a stabilizing influence is sorely missed. About one-third of the nation\u2019s welfare recipients live in California. Millions of poor newcomers require enormously expensive state health, housing, education, legal and law-enforcement services.\n\nCalifornia is now a one-party state. Democrats have supermajorities in both houses of the legislature. Only seven of the state\u2019s 53 congressional seats are held by Republicans. The result is that there is no credible check on a mostly coastal majority.\n\nHuge global wealth in high-tech, finance, trade and academia poured into the coastal corridor, creating a new nobility with unprecedented riches. Unfortunately, the new aristocracy adopted mindsets antithetical to the general welfare of Californians living outside their coastal enclaves. The nobodies have struggled to buy high-priced gas, pay exorbitant power bills and deal with shoddy infrastructure \u2014 all of which resulted from the policies of the distant somebodies.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s three most powerful politicians \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 are all multimillionaires. Their lives, homes and privileges bear no resemblance to those of other Californians living with the consequences of their misguided policies and agendas.\n\nThe state\u2019s elite took revolving-door entries and exits for granted. They assumed that California was so naturally rich, beautiful and well-endowed that there would always be thousands of newcomers who would queue up for the weather, the shore, the mountains and the hip culture.\n\nYet California is nearing the logical limits of progressive adventurism in policy and politics.\n\nResidents carefully plan long highway trips as if they were ancient explorers charting dangerous routes. Tourists warily enter downtown Los Angeles or San Francisco as if visiting a politically unstable nation.\n\nInsatiable state tax collectors and agencies are viewed by the public as if they were corrupt officials of Third World countries seeking bribes. Californians flip their switches unsure of whether the lights will go on. Many are careful about what they say, terrified of progressive thought police who seem more worried about critics than criminals.\n\nOur resolute ancestors took a century to turn a wilderness into California. Our irresolute generation in just a decade or two has been turning California into a wilderness.\n\n\u2022 Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, is the author of \u201cThe Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won\u201d (Basic Books, 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
