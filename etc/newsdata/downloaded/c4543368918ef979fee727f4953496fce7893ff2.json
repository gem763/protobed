I want to get out of the Middle East,\" Trump said at a joint press conference with the Italian president.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump said Graham should focus on his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating allegations of corruption during the 2016 election involving Obama administration officials. The president suggested he look into former President Obama, former CIA Director James Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyComey says he has a 'fantasy' about deleting his Twitter account after end of Trump term We need answers to questions mainstream media won't ask about Democrats Trump 'constantly' discusses using polygraphs to stem leaks: report MORE and others, alleging without evidence that they acted corruptly in the lead-up to his electoral victory.\n\n\"That\u2019s what Lindsey ought to focus on,\" Trump said. \"That's what the people of South Carolina want him to focus on.\"\n\n\"The people of South Carolina don't want us to get into a war with Turkey, a NATO member, over Syria,\" Trump added. \"Let them fight their own wars.\"\n\n\n\nThe senator dug in upon hearing of Trump's criticism, tweeting that he will \"NEVER be quiet\" on matters of national security.\n\n\"The worst thing any Commander in Chief can do is to give land back to the enemy that was taken through blood and sacrifice,\" Graham tweeted. \"I fear those are the consequences of the actions being taken right now.\"\n\nWhen it comes to America's national security I will NEVER be quiet. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 16, 2019\n\nGraham, typically a staunch Trump defender, has been at odds with the president ever since the White House announced earlier this month that it was pulling U.S. troops out of northern Syria.\n\nThe decision has led to bloodshed and uncertainty in the region as Turkey launched an offensive into northern Syria within days of the announcement from the White House.\n\nLawmakers have hammered the Trump administration for its decision, accusing it of abandoning its Kurdish allies who helped fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and warning that the move could lead to the terror group's resurgence.\n\nSpeaking in the Oval Office earlier Wednesday, Trump insisted that the conflict playing out in Syria \"has nothing to do with us,\" and he downplayed the value of the Kurdish alliance, telling reporters that the Kurds are \"no angels.\"\n\n\n\nThe remarks drew a rebuke from Graham, who raised concerns that Trump's shift in strategy could be worse than former President Obama's decision to leave Iraq.\n\n\"I worry we will not have allies in the future against radical Islam, ISIS will reemerge, & Iran\u2019s rise in Syria will become a nightmare for Israel,\" Graham tweeted. \"I fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking.\"\n\nThe rift between Trump and Graham and urged him to agree to a ceasefire came just as the two appeared to be finding common ground on the response to Turkey.\n\nTrump on Monday announced new sanctions on Ankara over its incursion into northern Syria. Graham joined Trump at the White House when the president called Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and urged him to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nVice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceDemocratic front-runners defend their age during debate Warren says she'll beat Trump 'or Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with' Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014 Buttigieg targets Warren, Sanders on health care ahead of debate | Judge overturns ObamaCare transgender protections | Poll sees support drop for 'Medicare for All' MORE and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump isolated amid Syria furor | Pompeo, Pence to visit Turkey in push for ceasefire | Turkish troops advance in Syria | Graham throws support behind Trump's sanctions Graham: Erdo\u011fan pledged to Trump to stay away from Kurdish territory in Syria Trump honors Stanley Cup champions, talks impeachment, Turkey MORE are set to depart later Wednesday to meet with Turkish officials, including Erdo\u011fan, to try and broker an end to the violence. But Trump's insistence that he will not reconsider taking troops out of northern Syria and his repeated assertions that the conflict there should be left for others to deal with threatens to undercut the delegation's negotiating position, something Graham himself noted.\n\nDuring Wednesday's press conference, Trump stood silently as Italian President Sergio Mattarella said through an interpreter that Italy is \"deeply concerned with Turkey's offensive.\"", "description": "President Trump on Wednesday fired back at close ally Sen.
