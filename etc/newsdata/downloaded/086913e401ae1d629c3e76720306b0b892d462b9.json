(Jim Bourg/Reuters)\n\nOne of my biggest problems with the worldview that Sohrab Ahmari outlines in the course of criticizing David French \u2014 and, for that matter, with the general tenor of the Deneen-inspired \u201canti-liberalism\u201d that First Things is presently indulging \u2014 is that it gets extremely fuzzy when it reaches the questions, \u201cWhat do we actually want?\u201d and \u201cHow do we intend to get there?\u201d Ahmari says he wants to \u201cfight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.\u201d Okay. But what does that actually mean in practice? What does a \u201cdefeated enemy\u201d look like? By what mechanism is the \u201cpublic square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good\u201d? Which \u201cpublic square\u201d? \u2014 there are many in America. And what is the \u201ccommon good and ultimately the Highest Good\u201d? Who decides? Ahmari? The Pope? Nicol\u00e1s Maduro?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI must confess that I am not entirely sure that Ahmari and his compatriots know. And this justification for his present approach \u2014 provided by Ahmari on Twitter yesterday \u2014 has deepened that suspicion:\n\nKavanaugh snapped something in me. \u2014 Sohrab Ahmari (@SohrabAhmari) May 30, 2019\n\nI have heard from a lot of people that the Kavanaugh affair \u201csnapped something in\u201d them. That\u2019s understandable. Indeed, if you look back at my writing at the time, I was absolutely outraged by what happened \u2014 and how. But the thing is, we won the Kavanaugh fight. And, crucially, the supposedly supine David French was unsparing in his defense of Kavanaugh. If that was the moment that Ahmari resolved to don a pith helmet and run to the barricades, he shouldn\u2019t have shunned David French for his uselessness, but immediately linked arms with him. I can\u2019t think of an incident that provoked behavior in David that was further from Ahmari\u2019s straw man. He was unblenching.\n\nMoreover, I struggle to remember an incident that better highlighted the need for (classical) liberalism. Ultimately, it was precisely the insistence upon classically liberal values such as cross-examination, hard evidence, and the presumption of innocence that won the day for Kavanaugh, against the sort of ends-oriented illiberalism that Ahmari seems increasingly to admire. The person who secured Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, remember, was . . . Susan Collins, and the (correct) reason she gave for her vote was that nothing had been proven and that that was unacceptable to her. She said:\n\nBut certain fundamental legal principles\u2014about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness\u2014do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them. In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy. The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when an accusation departs from a nominee\u2019s otherwise exemplary record. I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.\n\nThis is a David French argument. It is not a Sohrab Ahmari argument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr is it? In his essay, Ahmari knocks David for his focus on individualism. But was it not precisely a belief in individual rights that angered so many people at the Kavanaugh hearing \u2014 and, dare I say, led them to snap? Those leading the attack against Kavanaugh asked, cynically, \u201cwhy not just pick another judge?\u201d And the answer was because a man\u2019s reputation was at stake, and because in our culture \u2014 our \u201ctradition,\u201d in Ahmari\u2019s formulation \u2014 that matters. If the aim were purely to advance the ball on questions that are important to him, Ahmari wouldn\u2019t have cared much about Kavanaugh. Instead, he\u2019d have recommended dropping him and picking another justice who was acceptable to the editors at First Things. But he didn\u2019t. He \u201csnapped\u201d at the injustice of it all.\n\nWhy?", "description": "I have heard from a lot of people that the Kavanaugh affair \"snapped something in\" them.", "authors": ["Charles C. W.
