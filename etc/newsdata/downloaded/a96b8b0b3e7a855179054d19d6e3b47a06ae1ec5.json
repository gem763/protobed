The nation\u2019s largest domestic intelligence and law enforcement body, a beacon for impartial, professional, and expert investigative work now has a muddied reputation because some people didn\u2019t like the winner of the 2016 election. Yes, disgraced FBI Agent Peter Strzok who was fired for sending tens of thousands of anti-Trump texts to former bureau lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he was having an extramarital affair, embarrassed the agency. It also didn\u2019t help that this man reportedly signed off on the counterintelligence probe that became the investigation spearheaded by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He was also a key person in the FBI\u2019s analysis of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. There are discussions with also fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe about an insurance policy, which many have alleged is the infamous Trump dossier, compiled by ex-MI6 spy Christopher Steele and financed by the Clinton campaign and the Democrats. This political opposition research file, which appears to be unverified, was used to secure spy warrants against Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign.\n\nOh, and then there was the \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d the Trump presidency text from Strzok, who tried to pass these embarrassing communications off as a sign of his patriotism. Yeah, that\u2019s crap. I bring these cast of characters up because remember ex-Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Well, his lawyer is alleging that Strzok, McCabe, and other top officials at the FBI conspired to entrap Flynn. First, let\u2019s go back to why we\u2019re here (via NYT):\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations with the Russian ambassador last December, becoming the first senior White House official to cut a cooperation deal in the special counsel\u2019s wide-ranging inquiry into election interference. Mr. Flynn\u2019s discussions with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, were part of a coordinated effort by Mr. Trump\u2019s aides to create foreign policy before they were in power, documents released as part of Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea agreement show. Their efforts undermined the existing policy of President Barack Obama and flouted a warning from a senior Obama administration official to stop meddling in foreign affairs before the inauguration. The documents do not disclose what Mr. Trump knew about Mr. Flynn\u2019s discussions. But in at least one instance, prosecutors say, Mr. Flynn was directed by a \u201cvery senior member\u201d of the presidential transition team to discuss a United Nations resolution. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers believe that unnamed aide was Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, according to a lawyer briefed on the matter.\n\nThat was December of 2017. The financial squeeze the FBI put on Flynn probably forced him to plead out. Anyway, The Federalist reviewed a copy of a brief filed by Flynn\u2019s lawyer, Sidney Powell, where he alleges new texts from Strzok and other showed a collusion plot to entrap his client. Also, the 302 reports appear to be radically different and he\u2019s demanding that the FBI turn over more documents (via The Federalist):\n\nWhat is most striking, though, is the timeline Powell pieced together from publicly reported text messages withheld from the defense team and excerpts from documents still sealed from public view. The sequence Powell lays out shows that a team of \u201chigh-ranking FBI officials orchestrated an ambush-interview of the new president\u2019s National Security Advisor, not for the purpose of discovering any evidence of criminal activity\u2014they already had tapes of all the relevant conversations about which they questioned Mr. Flynn\u2014but for the purpose of trapping him into making statements they could allege as false.\u201d [\u2026] \u2026quoting from a sealed statement by Strzok, Powell reveals that over next two weeks, there were \u201cmany meetings\u201d between Strzok and [FBI Deputy Director Andrew] McCabe to discuss \u201cwhether to interview [] National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and if so, what interview strategies to use.\u201d And \u201con January 23, the day before the interview, the upper echelon of the FBI met to orchestrate it all. Deputy Director McCabe, General Counsel James Baker, Lisa Page, Strzok, David Bowdich, Trish Anderson, and Jen Boone strategized to talk with Mr. Flynn in such a way as to keep from alerting him from understanding that he was being interviewed in a criminal investigation of which he was the target.\u201d Next came \u201cComey\u2019s direction to \u2018screw it\u2019 in contravention of longstanding DOJ protocols,\u201d leading McCabe to personally call Flynn to schedule the interview. Yet none of Comey\u2019s notes on the decision to interview Flynn were turned over to defense. Even Obama-holdover \u201cDeputy Attorney General Sally Yates candidly opined that the interview \u2018was problematic\u2019 and \u2018it was not always clear what the FBI was doing to investigate Flynn,\u201d Powell stressed. Yet again, the prosecution did not turn over Yates\u2019 notes, but only \u201cdisclosed a seven-line summary of Ms. Yates statement six months after Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea.\u201d [\u2026] A sealed statement from Strzok confirmed that the \u201cagents did three briefings the day of the interview,\u201d and that Strzok had reported that Flynn \u201chad a sure demeanor, and he was telling the truth or believed he was\u2014even though he did not remember it all.\u201d This led the FBI and DOJ to then write \u201can internal memo dated January 30, 2017, exonerating Mr. Flynn of acting as an \u2018agent of Russia\u2019\u201d and expressing no concern of a possible Logan Act violation. [\u2026] On February 10, 2017, the news broke\u2014attributed to \u2018senior intelligence officials\u2019\u2014that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Ambassador Kislyak, contrary to what Vice President Pence had said on television previously.\u201d Following this leak, \u201covernight,\u201d Flynn\u2019s 302 was changed\u2014and substantively so. \u201cThose changes added an unequivocal statement that \u2018FLYNN stated he did not\u2019\u2014in response to whether Mr. Flynn had asked Kislyak to vote in a certain manner or slow down the UN vote.\u201d \u201cThis is a deceptive manipulation\u201d Powell highlighted, \u201cbecause, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on this issue. He had talked to dozens of countries.\u201d The overnight changes to the 302 also included the addition of a line, indicating Flynn had been question on whether \u201cKISLYAK described any Russian response to a request by FLYNN.\u201d But the agent\u2019s notes do not include that question or answer, Powell stressed, yet it was later made into the criminal offense charges against Flynn.\n\nThere are many more details about the discrepancies between what\u2019s in the official FBI report and what the agents wrote in their notes. These allegations are nasty business. It\u2019s one why we should always distrust and be fearful of government agents. No, fearful is not the right word. It\u2019s the FBI and the rest of the political class who should be afraid of us, the people. That notion that there are far more of us than there are of you\u2014who will smash your homes and livelihoods if you abuse power, should be ingrained into the psyches of the political class. It\u2019s the government that should be deathly afraid of the people. And after this Russia collusion nonsense and the impeachment circus that\u2019s engulfing House Democrats on the Hill, rule by fear might not be such a terrible protocol when it comes to keeping this D.C. scum in line.\n\nIn the meantime, this motion is before Judge Emmett Sullivan. We\u2019ll see what happens, but if this all turns out to be true\u2014and that Flynn was the target of a political hit job by the FBI\u2014Trump should pardon him immediately.", "description": ".10/25/2019 19:46:02PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/346/21b19db9-e35f-48b9-a1fa-53f3db70110e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
