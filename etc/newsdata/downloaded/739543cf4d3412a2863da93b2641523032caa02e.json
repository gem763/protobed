I decided to run Berlin because the course is so fast,\u201d Defar said.\n\nOther athletes are attempting to reach Olympic qualifying times - 2:11:30 for men and 2:29:30 for women, respectively - on the course.\n\nBut the majority of the record 46,983 registered runners for the 46th edition will be happy just to finish long after the favorites do.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Triple Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele is favored to make the most of Eliud Kipchoge's absence in Sunday's Berlin Marathon, where more world records have fallen than any other.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
