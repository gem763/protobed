There, just a few miles from Edgartown, sprawling nature preserves meet expansive ponds and sandy barrier beaches.\n\nA spokesperson for Mr. Obama and the listing agents for the property, Gerret Conover and Tom LeClair of Landvest, declined to comment on the potential deal, which was first reported by entertainment site TMZ. Mr. Grousbeck also declined to comment.\n\nMartha\u2019s Vineyard has long been a popular summer destination for top-shelf politicians, and the Obamas have spent several vacations there.

She initially worried that their security would drive away potential buyers and compound market difficulties. Fortunately, she said she has only noticed one car outside the home\u2019s entrance.\n\nThe property in question sits on Edgartown Great Pond, an 890-acre coastal body of water separated from the Atlantic by a slim barrier beach. It is known for its large wildlife population, which includes Herons, Kingfishers, otters, clams and oysters.\n\nOn more than 29 acres, the home is nearly 7,000 square feet and has seven bedrooms. Photo: LandVest\n\nOn more than 29 acres, the home is nearly 7,000 square feet, with seven bedrooms, a circular dining room surrounded by a wall of windows, vaulted ceilings with exposed steel beams and a large stone fireplace, according to the listing. There are two guest wings and a large master suite with a fireplace, a private sun deck and water views. The Obamas rented the home this summer, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have a lot of privacy given the amount of acreage,\u201d said Mark Jenkins of Wallace & Co. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, an agent who is listing property in the area but has no ties to the Obama house. \u201cNo one is going to be driving past the house and rubbernecking.\u201d\n\nMr. Grousbeck\u2019s property first came on the market for $22.5 million in 2015, according to Zillow. He acquired the site in 1998, and completed the home in 2003, records show.\n\nOwners of homes around the pond are often seen boating, kayaking or paddleboarding from their properties toward the barrier beaches, where they can go crabbing. While portions of the beaches are technically open to the public, they\u2019re most easily accessed by boat and therefore don\u2019t draw large crowds, according to real-estate agents in the area.\n\nOne prominent area resident is former talk show host David Letterman, whose sprawling waterfront estate occupies a property known as Herring Creek Farm, according to public records. Mr. Letterman\u2019s home sits on the eastern side of the pond, which is separated from the Obama home by a small cove. In 2001, Mr. Letterman and his neighbor Roger Bamford, a former principal engineer at Oracle , saved more than 200 acres in the area from development by purchasing it for $64 million through the local nature conservancy. A spokesman for Mr. Letterman declined to comment, as did Messrs. Conover and LeClair, the agents on the deal.\n\nOne prominent area resident is former talk show host David Letterman, whose home sits on the eastern side of the pond, separated from the Obama home by a small cove.

Barrack, Jr., the former head of President Donald Trump \u2019s inauguration committee, records show. Mr. Saltzman couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nPeyton Wallace, a local real-estate agent who said his family used to own a property abutting the Obama home and who is listing a $2.85 million parcel of land on the pond, recalled a blissful childhood. \u201cWe\u2019d go out to the beach in the morning, scoop up some crabs for dinner, and then come back and spend some time in the hammock,\u201d he said.\n\nAcross the street from the property reportedly being purchased by the Obamas is this home, which listed for $4.595 million. Photo: WPB3 Digital\n\nThere are more than 10 homes listed for sale around the pond, including two on the same peninsula as the Obama house, according to Zillow.\n\nA few houses away is a 3\u00bd-acre property with a four-bedroom, 2,723-square-foot house. It is asking $6.5 million. The most expensive home currently available on the pond is a $19.5 million estate with a 10,000-square-foot main house and sprawling landscaped grounds. Some of the available homes have been on the market for more than a year, and a number have recently undergone price cuts, Zillow shows. While the first half of the year was strong on the vineyard, the summer has been slow, said agents familiar with the area.\n\nThe property is about 18 miles east of Aquinnah, the area where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis\u2019s Red Gate Farm compound is located. That property is currently listed for $65 million. Photo: Getty Images\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unease nationally, and that always impacts the real-estate market, especially a second home market where buying is not a necessity,\u201d said Candy Da Rosa, the listing agent for the $6.5 million property.\n\nThe pond is about a 10-minute drive from Edgartown, the old whaling village known for its white-painted, 18th-century homes and historic lighthouse, and close to Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, where Mr. Obama has played.\n\nIt is about 18 miles east of Aquinnah, the area where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis \u2019s Red Gate Farm compound is located. That property is currently listed for $65 million by Ms. Kennedy\u2019s daughter, Caroline Kennedy.\n\nMs. Harman said most locals have enjoyed the Obama family\u2019s presence on the island. When they had dinner in town one night a few years ago, the Secret Service sprayed the letter \u201cO\u201d with temporary green paint on cars surrounding the restaurant, to mark which vehicles had been security checked.\n\n\u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t wash it off,\u201d she laughed.\n\nWrite to Katherine Clarke at katherine.clarke@wsj.com", "description": "The former first family is reportedly buying a $14.85 million home that sits on 29 acres along Edgartown Great Pond.", "authors": ["Katherine Clarke", "Katherine.Clarke Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EV438_obamam_TOP_20190828125654.jpg"}
