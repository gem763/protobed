Here we look at the history of the two sects of Islam, their differences and the distribution of their followers across the world.\n\nThe Shia (sometimes written Shi\u2019ite) movement within Islam has political origins; after the death of the Prophet Muhammed in AD 632, the founders of the Shia sect (who are collectively known as Shi\u2019a) wanted power to pass to the Prophet\u2019s son-in-law and cousin, Ali, and then to his male successors. Over the centuries that followed, religious differences developed between Shi\u2019a and non-Shi\u2019a Muslims alongside the initial political distinctions. The Shi\u2019a \u2013 who account for around 10-13% of the world\u2019s estimated 1,6 billion Muslim believers \u2013 acknowledge Ali as the divinely appointed Caliph (ruler of the nation of Islam) and his successors as Imams, who are blessed with divine knowledge.\n\nMuhammad didn\u2019t appoint his successor definitively and in the wake of his death the community of Arabic tribes he had converted to Islam a short time before, drifted to the edge of collapse.\n\nMuhammad\u2019s followers hastily appointed his successor as Caliph themselves, chosing his father- in-law, who also happened to be among his closest friends, Abu Bakr.\n\nAccording to some Shia sources, many Muslims believed Muhammad had appointed Ali, the husband of his daughter, as his successor. The division started at around this moment of history- those who backed Ali against Abu Bakr became the Shi\u2019a. The name itself comes from the Arabic word s\u00eda, which means \u2019party\u2019 or \u2019successors\u2019, referring to the first successors of Ali, namely the \u2019party of Ali\u2019 or \u2019s\u00edat Ali\u2019.\n\nAs it transpired Ali was selected to be the fourth Caliph, between AD 656 and AD 661. The division in Islam crystallised when Ali\u2019s son, Hussein, was killed in AD 680 in Karbala, Iraq by the ruling Caliph\u2019s troops. After Hussein\u2019s killing, the Sunni Caliphs seized and consolidated their political power, leaving the Shi\u2019a marginalised.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center\u2019s Forum on Religion & Public Life, in most countries in the Middle-East, at least 40% of Sunnis don\u2019t consider Shi\u2019a to be real Muslims; meanwhile, among Shi\u2019a criticism of Sunnis is sometimes an accusation that Sunni dogmatism can be a fertile breeding ground for Islamic extremist.\n\nDifferences in religious practices\n\nAside the fact that Shi\u2019a pray three times a day and Sunnis five times, there are also differences between Shi\u2019a and Sunni perception of Islam. Both branches are based on the teachings of the holy Quran, with the second most important source being the Sunnah, the exemplary way of life for Muslims as defined by both the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammed, known as Hadith. Shi\u2019a Muslims also consider the words of the imams as Hadith.\n\nOne of the most important differences between the ideology of the two sects is that the Shi\u2019a consider Imams to be divine and in possession of spiritual authority, a mediator between Allah and the believers. For Shi\u2019a, the Imam is not simply the deputy of the Prophet, but his representative on Earth. Thus the Shi\u2019a do not only make their pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca, but also to the tombs of 11 of the 12 Imams, who are considered saints (the 12th Imam, Mehdi, is considered \u2018hidden\u2019 or disappeared.\n\nSunni Muslims do not attach such reverence to an Imam and in Sunni Islam the term Imam refers to a contemporary mosque or Muslim community leader.\n\nThe five pillars of Islam \u2013 the declaration of Faith, Prayer, Fasting, Charity and Pilgrimage \u2013 while shared between Shi\u2019a and Sunni, are represented differently in the Shi\u2019a faith: Shi\u2019a Islam, as well as having five principal pillars different to those of Sunnis, also has 10 ancillaries, which incorporate the ideas expressed in the five Sunni pillars.\n\nThe five principal Shi\u2019a pillars are Tawhid (the Oneness of God), Nubuwwah (Prophethood), Resurrection, Divine Justice and Imamah (belief in the political and spiritual supremacy of the Prophet\u2019s successors). For the 10 ancillaries, the Shi\u2019a faith includes Prayer, Fasting, Charity and Pilgrimage, but adds Khums (the tax of one-fifth), Enjoining what is Just, Forbidding what is Evil, Tawall\u00e1 (loving what is Good) and Tabarra (disassociation with those who oppose Good and those who caused harm to Islam). Another ancillary in Shi\u2019a Islam is Jihad, the meaning of which continues to be debated by Islamic scholars. Traditionally Jihad is composed of two elements: an inner struggle with oneself to maintain the way of God and an outer struggle against Islam\u2019s enemies which can be either violent or non-violent.\n\nThe Shia Crescent\n\nMost of Shi\u2019a populations are found in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrain, and make up what\u2019s called the \u2019Shia crescent\u2019 because of the shape of these territories on a map.", "description": "With Arab world conflicts so often making headlines, the terms Shia and Sunni \u2013 the two main branches of Islam \u2013 are now familiar to many non-Muslims following world news, even if the characteristics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/320556/1000x563_320556.jpg", "published_at": "2016-08-01"}
