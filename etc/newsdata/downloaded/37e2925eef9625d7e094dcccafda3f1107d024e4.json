USA TODAY\n\nOXFORD, Miss. \u2014 Quarterback Grant Tisdale has left the Ole Miss football program as of Tuesday.\n\nTisdale was a four-star signee out of Texas who joined Ole Miss' Class of 2019 alongside fellow quarterbacks John Rhys Plumlee and Kinkead Dent. Tisdale has played in one game this season, going 2-for-2 with 56 yards and a touchdown against Alabama. He also ran twice for 10 yards.\n\nThe Clarion Ledger could not reach Tisdale for comment Tuesday when news broke of his departure.\n\nThroughout spring practice, Tisdale took a majority of the practice reps with the second team during the media viewing sessions of practice. When the team reconvened for fall practice and Plumlee joined the team, Plumlee and Tisdale split most of the second-team reps.\n\nTisdale met with the media last Wednesday and gave no indication of his intent to transfer. He did, however, say he intended to go home to Texas for the bye week.\n\nBowl projections: LSU moves in after Oklahoma falls out of College Football Playoff\n\nHeisman Watch: LSU quarterback Joe Burrow takes over as front-runner from Jalen Hurts\n\nRivals.com insider EJ Holland reported Tuesday night that Tisdale had entered the transfer portal. Tisdale's father, Mike, liked and retweeted multiple posts on Twitter about his son's decision.\n\nTisdale committed to Ole Miss on April 6, 2018, and signed with the Rebels in December. He did not report any other official visits after his commitment, but had previously reported offers from Baylor, SMU, Houston and Oklahoma State, as well as Ohio State, Oregon and Utah.\n\nTisdale had three SEC offers: Ole Miss, Mississippi State and Tennessee.\n\nOle Miss quarterback Grant Tisdale during Fall Camp in Oxford, MS, on Saturday, Aug. 3, 2019.

It is what it is. I just know great things are going to come his way.\"\n\nWith Tisdale out of the program, Ole Miss' remaining scholarship quarterbacks are Plumlee, Dent and redshirt freshman Matt Corral. The Rebels also have four-star quarterback Robby Ashford committed for the Class of 2020.", "description": "Ole Miss quarterback Grant Tisdale, a four-star recruit from their 2019 class, has left the program and entered the NCAA transfer portal.", "authors": ["Nick Suss", "Published P.M.
