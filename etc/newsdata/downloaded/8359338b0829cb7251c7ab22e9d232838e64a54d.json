The company also removed BackupHK, a separate app that served as mirror of the main HKlive.map app. Hong Kong police had no immediate comment.\n\nOn a Twitter an account believed to be owned by the HKlive.map app's developer said it disagreed with Apple's decision and there was no evidence to support the Hong Kong police's claims that the app had been used in ambushes.\n\nThe app consolidated content from public posts on social networks and that moderators would delete content that solicited criminal activity and would ban repeated attempts to post such content in the app, it said.\n\n\"The majority of user review(s) in App Store ... suggest HKmap IMPROVED public safety, not the opposite,\" it added.\n\nIn a separate move, Apple also removed the Quartz news app from its App Store in China because Chinese authorities said the app violated local laws.\n\nQuartz Chief Exeuctive Zach Seward told technology publication The Verge in a statement: \"We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nANGER IN HONG KONG\n\nThe HKlive.map app was removed from Apple's app store globally but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in Hong Kong, Reuters found. A web version was also still viewable on iPhones.\n\nOn Tuesday, the People's Daily said Apple did not have a sense of right and wrong, and ignored the truth. Making the app available on Apple's Hong Kong App Store at this time was \"opening the door\" to violent protesters in the former British colony, the newspaper wrote.\n\nUnder Apple's rules and policies, apps that meet its standards to appear in the App Store have sometimes been removed after their release if they were found to facilitate illegal activity or threaten public safety.\n\nIn 2011, Apple modified its app store to remove apps that listed locations for drunken driving checkpoints not previously published by law enforcement officials.\n\nWord of the HKmap.live app's removal spread quickly in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Does the entire world have to suck up to the garbage Communist Party?\" one commentator called Yip Lou Jie said in an online forum, LIHKG, which is used by protesters in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Additional reporting by Greg Mitchell in San Francisco and John Ruwitch in Hong Kong; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)", "description": "Apple Inc on Wednesday removed an app that protestors in Hong Kong have used to track police movements, saying the app violated its rules because it was used to ambush police and by criminals who used it to victimize residents in areas with no law enforcement.
