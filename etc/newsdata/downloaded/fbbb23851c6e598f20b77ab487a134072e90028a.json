The classrooms are empty and the playing fields muddied only by the changing weather.\n\nBut behind Hogwarts, as the old part of the school is affectionately known, sits the more modern sports centre. Here stands a reminder of how this leafy corner of Hertfordshire can be a gateway to sporting immortality.\n\nOn the wall alongside England lacrosse icon, Laura Merrifield, are pictures of four more former students. Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje, George Ford and Jack Singleton stare towards the doors below, where a solitary pair of black boots sit camouflaged by a layer of dirt.\n\nOwen Farrell and George Ford have made their way from St George\u2019s School to the World Cup\n\nThe posters chart each player\u2019s journey from Harpenden to Yokohama. On Saturday all four can become part of only the second England squad to rule the world.\n\nIt is an incredible return for a state comprehensive, albeit one with a proud rugby history.\n\nAnd when classes resume next week, the current crop will build up their strength in the Owen Farrell Fitness Suite, dreaming of a place on that wall of fame.\n\nThe last time England reached the final of the rugby World Cup, Farrell was a student, learning from the master. He and neighbour George Ford were teenagers in 2007 when they travelled to France to watch Jonny Wilkinson. Owen\u2019s father Andy was part of the England squad that lost the final to South Africa, while George\u2019s dad Mike was defence coach.\n\nFarrell, Ford, Maro Itoje and Jack Singleton all went to the comprehensive in Harpenden\n\nThe names of the four players feature proudly on the school's international honours board\n\nThe two youngsters had a kicking session with Wilkinson and on his return Farrell Jnr shared what he had learned with the school.\n\nAndy Bennett, a former St George\u2019s rugby coach who taught the England captain, said: \u2018He took a PE practical lesson with his year 10 and 11 friends and taught them the techniques of goal kicking after doing the same session with Jonny Wilkinson. He said, \u201cSir, can I take this on?\u201d I said, \u201cI think you\u2019re more suitable than I may be at this point!\u201d\u2019\n\nFarrell, now aged 28, will lead from the front once more when England face the Springboks. He, Itoje and Ford have been standout performers in Japan, while Singleton has played his part, too.\n\nThe Old Georgians are still influencing lessons back home. Neil Harris, the head of rugby, said: \u2018I often talk about Owen\u2019s passing technique and a lot of our goal kickers look at Owen\u2019s kicking.\n\n\u2018What is really nice is that new boys come to the school and look up at Maro, Owen, Jack and George. They\u2019re in the same uniform and rugby kit that those guys wore and they\u2019ve done so many things that connects them to those guys.\u2019\n\nRugby Master Neil Harris says the Old Georgians are still influencing lessons back home\n\nFarrell swapped Wigan for Harpenden when his dad switched codes and joined Saracens in 2005. Ford lived down the road after his dad began coaching at the Premiership club. Itoje was one of the few boys who boarded at the state school, while Singleton came from a strong sporting family.\n\nSt George\u2019s has a long rugby tradition, although their funding and facilities are a far cry from those at traditional public schools, the typical breeding grounds of English rugby.\n\nBut Bennett believes being a comprehensive and mixed works in St George\u2019s favour. \u2018They produce well-rounded students who if they want to achieve something have the self-belief to do so,\u2019 he says.\n\nNo one embodies that spirit more than Itoje. \u2018He will kill me for saying this but he wasn\u2019t the most natural, co-ordinated sportsman at 14. He\u2019s had to work exceptionally hard,\u2019 Harris says.\n\n\u2018He would ask to do extras at lunchtime or we would meet him before school in our sports hall and we\u2019d do extra restart takes. You can\u2019t coach someone to be 6ft 6in but you can enhance their skills.\n\nPosters on the school walls chart each player\u2019s journey from Harpenden to Yokohama\n\n\u2018I was convinced he would have made a great athlete so I spent a lot of time teaching him the shot put.\u2019 Itoje grew to become one of the country\u2019s best \u2014 ranked No 2 in the country at under 15 age group. \u2018But he insisted he was going to be a rugby player.\u2019\n\nThe game came more easily to Farrell, Ford, and Singleton. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen an 18-year-old with a kick and pass game like Owen\u2019s before,\u2019 Harris says.\n\nFarrell\u2019s strong northern accent \u2014 and his competitiveness \u2014 separated him from the crowd. Bennett said: \u2018Even if he was having a kickaround with his mates he wanted to win and he will go all out to do so. He wasn\u2019t the sportsman who plays up and acts the idiot. It would have been easy for him to be an absolute pain but he never went down that road.\u2019\n\nSingleton was another kid whose natural abilities put him a cut above the rest. He could play a number of positions and at Under 15 Harris suggested he give hooker a try. Now, aged 23, he is England\u2019s third choice No 2.\n\nFord left St George\u2019s after a year but he was there long enough for coaches to notice him\n\nFord left St George\u2019s after a year. But he was there long enough for former head of PE Steve Robins to notice him.\n\n\u2018He\u2019d come from a rugby league background,\u2019 Robins recalls. \u2018I did tell him that I\u2019d turn him from the dark side. I did get him into union. That was my promise to him,\u2019 he laughs. \u2018He won a book prize and I said to him, \u201cThe only book you can go out and buy is on skills of rugby union, you can\u2019t buy anything else!\u201d\u2019\n\nAs with England now, 26-year-old Ford led from the front in tandem with his close friend Farrell. \u2018The lads followed them because they respected them,\u2019 Robins says.\n\nTo this day, Itoje and Singleton still help out where they can. The pair have sent messages of good luck to the current crop, while Itoje has been back in recent years to meet the next generation.\n\nItoje donated an England shirt to the school from his time with the Under 18s side\n\nEven as his star has risen, the 25-year-old remains ruthlessly determined but kind and considerate. Just as his teachers remember. Only recently Itoje agreed to a 45-minute interview to help Harris with his coaching qualification assignment.\n\nThe England star texts Bennett, too, asking how his family is and referring to him as \u2018Mr B\u2019. Before Eddie Jones\u2019s squad flew to Japan, they were reunited. Itoje named Bennett as one of the coaches who helped him on his way, so the RFU invited his former teacher to surprise him. Itoje remembers the hours Bennett and Harris dedicated to help him develop, while his performances suggest he has not forgotten the skills he honed in that sports hall.\n\nHarris is doing his best to ensure this is not a one-off, too. \u2018There is no doubt they are inspiring a lot of boys, and certainly there are another couple that are worth keeping an eye on,\u2019 he says.\n\nLike Farrell and Ford before them, this crop could soon be learning from England World Cup winners. Four of them.", "description": "SPECIAL REPORT BY DANIEL MATTHEWS: It is half term at St George's School in Harpenden.
