Of course, with her already having discovered the truth about cheating fianc\u00e9 Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill), the question is: will the pair make it down the aisle?\n\nViewers have seen Michelle planning her big day, but \u2014 unbeknown to her \u2014 Robert is also secretly engaged to Vicky (Kerri Quinn). After an upcoming road-side accident leaves Robert fighting for his life, the truth about his secret double life is put at risk, as both Michelle and Vicky rush to be at their lover\u2019s bedside.\n\nCoronation Street has already confirmed that Michelle will discover the truth about her fiance\u2019s double-life, and thus she\u2019ll set out \u2014 with Carla (Alison King) by her side \u2014 to try and figure out what\u2019s going on. It doesn\u2019t take her long to do so, as she spots Robert publicly arguing with Vicky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens after Michelle\u2019s discovery remains to be seen, but it seems as if she\u2019s set to go through with her plans to marry Robert \u2014 or, at the very least, get him up the aisle.\n\n(Picture: Mark Campbell/MCPIX)\n\n(Picture: Mark Campbell/MCPIX)\n\nActress Kym has been spotted filming in a wedding dress on-location, but the question is: is Michelle simply determined to get her happy ending with Robert? Or will she seek revenge on her cheating fianc\u00e9 for all that he\u2019s put her through?\n\nIn typical Corrie fashion, it\u2019s set to be a big event, as several cobbles regulars including Carla and Jenny (Sally Ann Matthews) will all be present on the big day.\n\n(Picture: Mark Campbell/MCPIX)\n\nWeatherfield weddings have something of a habit for ending in disaster so \u2014 regardless of the outcome \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt going to be incredibly dramatic scenes in store for viewers\n\nThe wedding scenes were filmed on location in Manchester and will be broadcast in December.\n\nKym recently took to Twitter to reveal how she\u2019d received her final Corrie scripts, and \u2014 considering fellow actors Jennie McApline and Sally Ann Matthews have previewed the Christmas episodes after receiving their latest scripts, it\u2019s likely that Michelle is set to depart around Christmas time.\n\nIf so, then this could suggest that the events of her wedding play an instrumental part in her decision to leave the cobbles.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will the wedding go ahead?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/michelle-connor-corrie-wedding_1571130865.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
