We are going to have to be awake on that.\"\n\nAlun Wyn Jones v Eben Etzebeth\n\n\n\nAs the Prince of Wales told the Welsh players when he visited them at training this week, the Springboks are \"bloody big buggers\".\n\nThe lock pairing of Eben Etzebeth and Lood de Jager form a prime example of that, more than filling the enforcer role so long held by the likes of Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha.\n\nEtzebeth might facing charges of racial abuse, but that has not stopped him performing in Japan, the lynchpin of a Bok pack that will undoubtedly go toe-to-toe with Wales.\n\nJones will be at the heart of Welsh efforts to undermine the devastating South African rolling maul, dominant lineout and midfield ball-carrying by the forwards.\n\n\"They've gone back to their strengths,\" Wales coach Warren Gatland says of South Africa. \"And their strengths are definitely that physicality up front with driving lineouts and a strong scrum and ball-carrying and beating teams far side.\"\n\nDe Jager adds: \"It's been a big focus, and against Wales, there will be a massive focus on the lineout, maul and scrum.\n\n\"The team that wins that battle will most likely come away with the win on Sunday. We are going to put a big emphasis on the set piece for this game.\"\n\nJustin Tipuric v Pieter-Steph du Toit\n\n\n\nFlanker Tipuric is at the heart of Wales' blitz defence, a proven scavenger who is strong over the ball.\n\nHe has formed a sterling relationship with Aaron Wainwright, with Ross Moriarty at number eight, and that back row will have to be at their very best come Sunday.\n\nDu Toit is a rangy, solid player who is key for the Boks in the breakdown battle as de Klerk and Pollard look to set South Africa's outside backs free.\n\nBoth Tipuric and Du Toit are effective lineout jumpers and will have crucial roles to play in the battle for set-piece dominance.\n\nTeams:\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\nWales\n\n15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 George North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Ross Moriarty, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones, 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn Jones\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Aaron Shingler, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Owen Watkin", "description": "Wales and South Africa clash on Sunday in a blockbuster World Cup semi-final between the Six Nations champions and Rugby Championship title-holders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9500/4526796c451a46d2aef7249c53afd39f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
