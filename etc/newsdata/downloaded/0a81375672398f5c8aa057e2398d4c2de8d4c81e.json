Magical powers. The acclamation of Greta Thunberg is as profoundly irrational as the millenarian cult of purgation and redemption that she advocates \u2014 puritan in its authoritarian demands, lascivious in its sensitivity to pain. The intrusion of this kind of sub-religious foolishness into politics is always a bad sign. It shows that we are in an environmental crisis, and that the world is coming to an end. But which environment, and which world?\n\nThe environment that is dying is the liberal democratic order in which we live. The world that is coming to an end is political: the post-1945 order, led by the United States. The form of Great Thunberg\u2019s protest is familiar to any student of medieval Europe, the civilization that produced the Children\u2019s Crusade and Joan of Arc. The content of her protest is a deliquescence of Protestantism into narcissistic terror.\n\n\u2018We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth,\u2019 says Greta. She was five years old when the wheels came off the European economy in 2008, and stole the dreams of a generation. The Swedes, like most other Europeans, have given up on procreation. Their demography is sustained by massive immigration which, their leaders tell them, is necessary in order to maintain the tax base and the welfare system.", "description": "", "authors": ["Dominic Green", "Spectator.Us Apotheosis-St-Greta"], "top_image": ""}
