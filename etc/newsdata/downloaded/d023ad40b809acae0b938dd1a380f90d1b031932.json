But if passengers do not have the proper documents, \u201cthey will not be able to fly,\u201d Cogswell said.\n\nAs of Oct. 1st, 47 of 50 states were issuing REAL ID compliant licenses.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nOregon, Oklahoma, New Jersey -- along with the U.S. territories Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa -- are not issuing REAL IDs yet, but according to Anne Ferro, CEO of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, all states are on track to become compliant ahead of the October 2020 deadline.\n\nIf you do not a REAL ID compliant credential, what else can you use to board a flight?\n\nTSA will accept identification documents such as passports, military ID cards and Global Entry cards and provides a full list of acceptable identification documents on their website.\n\nPassengers being unable to fly could have a huge economic impact. It's estimated that if REAL ID were implemented today, it could result in up to $40.3 million in lost travel spending in the first day.\n\nOfficials encouraged the public to check their identification and make plans in advance. Without that, \u201cwe will have chaos at our airports,\u201d Kevin Burke, the CEO of the Airports Council International North America, said.", "description": "TSA officials are working to inform passengers about the upcoming change with a public awareness campaign that includes signs in airports and checkpoints.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/real-id-presser-ap-jef-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
