It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that [the European Council] endorses this deal,\u201d said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nSterling has jumped more than 1\u00a2 against the US dollar. But there's still a big challenge: getting a majority of MPs in Britain's hung parliament to back the deal.\n\nDespite being more than 40 MPs short of a majority, Mr Johnson appears to be betting he can get to 320 votes without the backing of the 10 legislators from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nThey issued a statement earlier on Thursday that they didn't back the deal \"as things stand\". After Mr Johnson announced the deal, the party said its statement \"still stands\".", "description": "After years of torturous negotiations, Britain and the European Union have finally agreed to a Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3445%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/eb1c15ba44c084e38ea3c3bbee3d446a0851c019", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
