Life is so unfair. The people\u2019s pop star, with her new photography book on shelves now, has retired to a lavish location, where she will now proceed to blow our minds via social media. Just last night, she posted a video of her catwalking outside a villa. A video that says everything from \u201cNo, I\u2019m not working on the album\u201d to \u201cJust because Fashion Month is over doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t take your gigs.\u201d The post has over 10 million views, over 90,000 comments, and only half of those views are from employees of Vulture.com (a sizable fraction from yours truly). Even though it\u2019s in slow motion, the video demands careful analysis.\n\nThe outfit? Relaxed and understated \u2014 her tattoos are the accessories. The bag? House of Fenty, of course. #IsItSponWhenYouRuntheCompany? Our wigs? Launched! Never to be seen again. Frankly, we don\u2019t want \u2019em back! If her evil plan was to get us to forget about R9 (and the alleged R10), congrats, it worked!", "description": "Rihanna posted a slow-motion video of her catwalking while on vacation and, honestly, it\u2019s better than an album.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/7-rihanna.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
