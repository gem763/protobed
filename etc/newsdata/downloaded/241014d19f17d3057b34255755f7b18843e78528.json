Dina Asher-Smith has the gold medal to prove it.\n\nWhere last Sunday she followed in footsteps few British women had ever taken when winning 100m silver, here she forged her own path in going one better. By breaking her own national record to win world 200m gold in 21.88 seconds, Asher-Smith made history as the first British woman ever to win a global sprint title.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nYet what she achieved in Doha stretches far beyond that one statistic, no matter how momentous it may be. This goes bigger.\n\nAsher-Smith has been the sprint queen of Britain for quite some time. Last year, she became the undisputed sprint queen of Europe. After Wednesday night\u2019s exploits, how can anyone else have a better claim to the title sprint queen of the world?\n\nAsher-Smith, alone, made both women\u2019s 100m and 200m podiums here in Doha. And while there were various reasons for the absence of many of her rivals, they should be treated as no more than that - circumstantial factors that bear no relevance to the outcome. Her winning time would have been good enough for gold in 13 of the 17 editions of the World Championships. So much for anyone who claims this was a soft gold medal.\n\nThere was just no stopping Dina Asher-Smith on her way to 200m gold Credit: Getty Images\n\nAfter crossing the finish line there was first disbelief. Then came pure elation. And finally, when she was reunited with her mother Julie, who travels the world watching her daughter race, came the tears.\n\nUltimately, the only words that matter are this: Asher-Smith, world champion.\n\n\u201cThis means so much,\u201d said Asher-Smith who is a Telegraph Women\u2019s Sport columnist. \u201cI woke up today thinking: \u2018this is it\u2019. This is the moment to do all the work for. Suddenly the tiredness disappeared.\n\n\u201cEveryone said \u2018you are the favourite\u2019, but you still have to go and do it and you have to perform. I was focused on that.\n\n\u201cI have dreamt of this and now it\u2019s real. I am getting all emotional, this means a lot, I am really happy.\u201d\n\nHaving routinely challenged herself against the best in world this year, it was no surprise to see Asher-Smith obliterate her rivals on Wednesday night. Because, truth be told, if the headline act had looked either side of her at any point during the 200m final she would have seen a cast of understudies.\n\nAsher-Smith holds high the Union Jack during her well-deserved victory lap Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe absentee list was long. A scheduling clash meant Shaunae Miller-Uibo, unbeaten in two years over 200m, was unable to contest the event; Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Marie-Josee Ta Lou, world gold and bronze 100m medallists last weekend, decided against putting their bodies through a second discipline; double world 200m champion Dafne Schippers and Olympic champion Elaine Thompson both withdrew injured; and Blessing Okagbare was disqualified in the heats.\n\nAs Asher-Smith\u2019s team-mate Adam Gemili put it before the race: \u201cIt\u2019s not about if she\u2019s going to win it, it\u2019s about how fast she can go.\u201d\n\nIn such circumstances, she could easily have cruised to gold with minimal exertion. Instead she went faster than she had ever gone before. The margin of victory was wide, with surprise silver medallist Brittany Brown, of the United States, clocking 22.22sec, and Switzerland\u2019s Mujinga Kambundji running 22.51sec for bronze. They were effectively competing in a different race from the superstar out front.\n\n\u201cObviously you want to run in front of a stacked field,\u201d said Asher-Smith, of her missing rivals. \u201cAt the same time, a World Championship title is a World Championship title. And 21.88 is still a good time in the final.\u201d This was not about those not there. This was Asher-Smith\u2019s day - the day she put British women\u2019s sprinting on the global map. A trailblazer.\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson in the shot put Credit: Getty Images\n\nIf Katarina Johnson-Thompson has her way, she will follow Asher-Smith to gold after an extraordinary opening-day performance meant she gained an overnight lead in the heptathlon above reigning Olympic, world and European champion Nafi Thiam.\n\nJohnson-Thompson set huge personal bests in the 100m hurdles, where she clocked 13.09 seconds, and shot put, which she launched 13.86m, as well as a championship record 1.95m high jump and season\u2019s best 23.08sec 200m. That gave her an overnight points tally of 4,138 - a lead of 96 over Thiam, with the rest of the field trailing some way back in their wake.\n\nAsked if she believes she can win gold, she replied: \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s something that I\u2019m aiming to do, something that I\u2019m in shape to do and I\u2019m in a very good position to do it. I\u2019ve worked very hard on my day two so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\n9:15PM\n\nVictory shot\n\nIt was a case of catch me if you can for Dina Asher-Smith on a memorable night in Doha.\n\nAsher-Smith crosses the line Credit: Reuters\n\nAsher-Smith leaves her rivals trailing in Doha Credit: AP\n\n9:08PM\n\nThe full results...\n\nForgive me for concentrating completely on Dina - she did make history after all - here are the full results of the race.\n\nIn second was American Brittany Brown and another European Mujinga Kambundji of Switzerland took the bronze.\n\nThe full results Credit: IAAF\n\n9:02PM\n\nTo anyone who says Dina was up against a weak field...\n\nDina Asher-Smith\u2019s 200m winning time of 21.88 seconds would have been good enough for gold at 13 of the 17 World Championships.

Why British sprint sensation Dina Asher-Smith is so good at the 200m?\n\nDina Asher-Smith is the favourite Credit: Getty Images\n\n8:05PM\n\nBritain's golden girl goes for global gold\n\nNo British woman has ever won a world sprint title. Not only that but no British woman won individual world medals in two events. This evening Dina Asher-Smith is looking to achieve both those feats.\n\nShe's already created history in Doha, becoming the first British woman since Kathy Smallwood-Cook in 1983 to win a global sprinting medal. Her silver in the 100m, achieved with a national record of 10.83 seconds, two hundredths inside her personal best, underlined her reputation for rising to the most daunting challenges, and has set her up for going one better in the 200m.\n\nThe 23 year old is the favourite tonight, partly due to the fact that most of her main rivals will not be lining up against her - following last night's withdrawal of Elaine Thompson. The Jamaican pulled out of last night's semi-finals due to a problem with her Achilles, and that means there's no Shaunae Miller-Uibo, no Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, no Dafne Schippers, no Marie-Josee Ta Lou, no Blessing Okagbare and now no Thompson, for Asher-Smith to beat.\n\nAs our own Ben Bloom put it: \"If you own a house, I reckon it's safe to stick it on Dina Asher-Smith winning gold.\"\n\nLet's hope Ben's right...", "description": "For the first time in history, Britain has a female sprinter who can call\u00a0 themselves the best in the world.
