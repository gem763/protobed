I mean, that\u2019s why I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an opinion, because they haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s underneath,\u201d Eilish has said. (Calvin Klein/YouTube)\n\nAnd with this look being perhaps her biggest and baggiest yet, we can\u2019t help but wonder \u2014 what\u2019s next? A tent?\n\nUntil we get our full campsite fantasy, here\u2019s a look back at some of the most odd and iconic looks Billie has turned to date.\n\nIkea bag realness\n\n(Vivian Killilea/Getty Images)\n\nIn May 2017, Eilish showed up to the Billboard Music Awards in a shawl that looked like an Ikea shopping bag. Question is, how much would she ring in at at checkout? Until we find out, we\u2019ll settle for some Swedish meatballs.\n\nSugar, spice and every bling nice\n\n(Ari Perilstein/Getty Images)\n\nEilish sported yet another \u201cpuffy\u201d look (get it?) to the ASCAP Pop Music Awards in May 2019, inspired by the hit superhero cartoon Powerpuff Girls from the early 2000s. Probably not the best thing to wear when fighting crime, though.\n\nPainting accident?\n\n(Joe Scarnici/Getty Images)\n\nAt Spotify\u2019s Billie Eilish Experience pop-up earlier this year, Eilish made a splash by rocking a bucket hat and outfit that looked like she walked under a ladder at the wrong time, paint-bucket-on-head style. Thankfully, this accident is a happy one.\n\nYou\u2019re one sick puppy\n\n(Leon Neal/Getty Images)\n\nThis outfit would definitely make for one scary-looking veterinarian. Thankfully, Eilish is too busy with her music career to look after sneezing puppies. The garment was unveiled in June as part of Stella McCartney\u2019s new collection, inspired by The Beatles.", "description": "Billie Eilish\u2019s sleeping bag couture from her Elle song association video and other odd looks from the teen superstar.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/Billie-Eilish.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
