This, along with Powell cementing a view toward additional rate cuts, should have provided ammunition for bulls, but it didn\u2019t. Though the (+0.26%) closed higher on the day, the (-0.17%) and (-0.47%) both finished lower.\n\nThe true tailwind for the SPX's weekly performance was the latest development in the ongoing U.S.-China trade relations roller coaster. The S&P 500 jumped 1.79% higher, with all 11 sectors in the green. (+2.75%) and shares (+2.48%) led the gains, while (+0.37%) lagged.\n\nSPX Daily\n\nTechnically, we are in a quandary regarding the S&P 500 index. We've been bearish on the benchmark due to congestion below the broken uptrend line since the December bottom.\n\nHowever, the price provided an upside breakout and closed above the uptrend line for a second day\u2014including ahead of a weekend, usually a very bullish signal.The difficulty with this pattern is that it\u2019s within an ascending triangle, presumably bullish, as buyers overtake sellers.\n\nStill, it's typically an interruption of an uptrend, though not after a 6.8% drop, seen from late-July to early-August. Also, it developed after falling below the uptrend line.\n\nOn the other hand, an ascending triangle could operate as a bottom. However, a 6% drop after a 29% advance since late-December, when it just broke below the uptrend line, doesn\u2019t strike us the stuff of a bottom. Our conclusion: the normal supply-demand mechanism seems to be out of sync in today\u2019s market.\n\nUST 3-M Daily\n\nTreasury yields finished mixed. While yields rose to 1.54% after Powell suggested the Fed\u2019s \u201cmidcycle adjustment\u201d might indeed turn into a policy change, the yield on the note dropped to 1.56%.\n\nNonetheless, the finished at 1.964%, so the yield curve remains inverted.\n\nDXY Daily\n\nThe dollar inched lower on Friday, for a fourth straight daily loss. Even so, the USD bounced well off the day\u2019s lows, for a second day, suggesting support toward the bottom of a rising channel since June.\n\nOil Daily\n\neked out a third daily gain, fueled by hopes on trade and a dovish Fed. However it stopped short of crossing above its downtrend line since Apr. 23, after Thursday\u2019s shooting star, which confirmed the downtrend line\u2019s resistance.\n\nIn other words, global slowdown fears continue to loom large. The 50 DMA and 2000 DMA have been wrestling with the trend since July.\n\nWeek Ahead\n\nAll times listed are EDT\n\nSunday\n\nMonday\n\n19:50: Japan \u2013: expected to come in at 1.3% from 1.8% YoY and 0.3% from 0.4% , bolstering the global slowdown scenario.\n\n4:30: UK \u2013 : seen to edge higher to -0.1% from -0.2% QoQ, bucking the global slowdown trend, and somewhat poignant amid the current disorderly Brexit situation.\n\n4:30: UK \u2013 : expected to increase to -0.1% from -0.2% MoM, reinforcing the GDP\u2019s implications.\n\nTuesday\n\n10:00: U.S. \u2013 : expected to fall to 7,300M from 7,348M previous.\n\nWednesday\n\n8:30: U.S. \u2013 : forecast to edge up to 0.1% from 0.2%.\n\n10:30: U.S. \u2013 : seen to jump to -2.488M from -4.771M. Still, inventory numbers have lately had negligible effect on prices since the macro environment remains dominated by U.S.-China trade.\n\nThursday\n\n7:45: Eurozone \u2013 : expected to remain at 0.00%.\n\n8:30: U.S. \u2013 : likely to edge lower to 0.2% from 0.3%.\n\n8:30: Eurozone \u2013 ; .\n\nFriday\n\n8:30: U.S. \u2013 : forecast to remain flat at 0.1%; expected to have dropped to 0.2% from 0.7% the previous month.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com covering: S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, US SmallCap 2000, US Dollar Index Futures.
