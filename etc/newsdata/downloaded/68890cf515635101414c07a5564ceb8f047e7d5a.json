It matched the highest ever wind speed recorded at landfall, and stayed over affected areas for two days.\n\nOfficials say hundreds, possibly thousands, are still missing and the final death toll could be \"staggering\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Great Abaco has been rendered virtually uninhabitable\n\nThe International Red Cross fears 45% of homes on Grand Bahama and the Abacos - some 13,000 properties - were severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nParts of the Bahamas received up to 35in (89cm) of rain, leaving vast areas flooded.\n\nThe island of Great Abaco is virtually uninhabitable, with bodies piled up, no water, power or food, and militias formed to prevent looting, local media report.\n\nAerial images over the Abacos showed mile upon mile of destruction, with roofs torn off, scattered debris, overturned cars, shipping containers and boats, and high water levels.\n\nUse our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured:\n\nHurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.\n\nWarm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\"\n\nTweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h\n\nSome minor flooding, little structural damage.\n\nStorm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h\n\nRoofs and trees could be damaged.\n\nStorm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h\n\nHouses suffer damage, severe flooding\n\nStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h\n\nSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.\n\nStorm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+\n\nSerious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.\n\nStorm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless \"For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.\"\n\nMayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...
