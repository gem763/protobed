I mean, for real. What happened to them, by the, by the early \u201870s, the late \u201860s, there was a whole generation that said, \u2018Enough.\u2019 The war in Vietnam was under way, and it was \u2014 a lot of you served in that war \u2014 and, uh, we were fighting like the devil to make sure that there was something dealing with cleaning up the environment, which was only beginning. We were in a position where the women\u2019s movement was just beginning to move. We should have, by now, long before, passed the ERA amendment, but that was another issue \u2026\u201d\n\nSticky-squeezed into plastic chairs, the torpid crowd used handed-out campaign paraphernalia to fan their sweaty faces. But at this mention of the equal rights amendment, somebody started to clap, and others followed suit, and the smattering of applause felt like an act of mercy \u2014 giving the characteristically discursive Biden a chance to reset and everybody else the opportunity to take a breath and maybe not think too hard about the fact that the former vice president had bungled by a decade the dates of two of the most jarring and consequential killings in modern American history.\n\nThere is an entire cohort of Biden supporters for whom his age \u2014 actual and perceived \u2014 is the very thing that recommends him\n\nAfter Biden finished talking, he spent the better part of an hour mingling with the many who wanted to stick around for selfies. Clad in brown loafers, trim tan slacks and a snug navy-blue polo shirt that accentuated the lean musculature of his tan upper arms, he worked the rope line with vigor and veteran aplomb, shaking hands, kissing cheeks and smiling to flash his teeth that are an even brighter shade than his wispy white hair.\n\nA young staffer with a clipboard asked a man within my earshot if he wanted to sign up to commit to caucus for Biden.\n\n\u201cAlready filled it out,\u201d the man responded. \u201cI think I did that in \u201987.\u201d The first time Biden ran for president \u2014 32 years ago.\n\nThis event, like every Biden event, couldn\u2019t help but highlight one of the defining realities of his 2020 candidacy: Next month, he turns 77 years old. His age is the subtext, and increasingly the text, too, of not only his bid but the Democratic Party\u2019s primary as a whole. Even as fading poll numbers loosen his status as the favorite and the mounting impeachment fervor over Ukraine threatens to exact a collateral toll, Biden\u2019s age remains an overarching issue.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue because of the simple math: Only three presidents have served in their 70s \u2014 Trump, Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower \u2014 and no president ever has finished a term at the age Biden would begin his. It\u2019s an issue because of things Biden has said and done \u2014 suggesting, for instance, he thought he was in Vermont when he actually was in New Hampshire, dropping that wince-worthy phrase that his \u201ctime is up\u201d in the first debate and oddly invoking a record player in the last debate. His lifelong habit of flubs, gaffes and often garbled speaking now can seem less like \u201cJoe being Joe\u201d and more like an ominous indicator of a creeping loss of mental acuity.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue because Biden himself has tried in sometimes awkward ways to keep it from being one, inviting a heckler to run with him during a parade and challenging a reporter to a wrestling match. And it\u2019s an issue because opponents, from Trump (\u201cSleepy Joe\u201d) to those in his own party trying to knock him off, have made it an issue \u2014 from Eric Swalwell sayingit was time to \u201cpass the torch\u201d to Tim Ryan saying he\u2019s \u201cdeclining\u201d to Julian Castro (dubiously) accusing him of \u201cforgetting\u201d things to Cory Booker dishing out readymade Republican attack ad fodder by bluntly declaring on CNN that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling\u201d and \u201cthere are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d Even the famously gracious Jimmy Carter, who just turned 95, delivered a candid if unhelpful assessment last month when he said he didn\u2019t believe he could have handled \u201cthe duties that I experienced when I was president\u201d if he had been 80.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about Biden\u2019s age \u2014 it\u2019s about ours, and the tension between a vast cohort of Baby Boomers who have trained themselves to believe they\u2019re only as old as they feel and a couple of impatient generations lined up behind them, wondering when they\u2019re going to get a chance to take over. And yet it\u2019s about far more than simply a number next to a name. Our sense of who is old in this primary has become entwined with our appetite for bold and new ideas. All three of the top-polling Democrats, after all, are in their 70s, but it\u2019s Biden, the centrist who advocates for a return to a pre-Trump time, who is getting dinged the most for his advanced age \u2014 not Elizabeth Warren, who wants \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and turned 70 in June. Up until this week when he had to have two heart stents implanted, neither was Bernie Sanders, who continues to call for his \u201crevolution\u201d and is in fact the oldest of the lot.\n\nBut there is an entire cohort of Biden supporters for whom his age \u2014 actual and perceived \u2014 is the very thing that recommends him. After the tumult of the Trump years, these voters crave the experience and order and stability Biden promises. For them, Biden is the beneficiary of shifting social and cultural notions that make it harder to pinpoint what it actually means to be old. Federal law protects workers from age discrimination starting at 40. People can join AARP at 50. They\u2019re usually eligible for Medicare at 65 and Social Security at 66. Scientifically, though, a half-dozen aging experts I talked to for this story told me, there\u2019s such vast variability in how people age that it\u2019s ill-advised and even irresponsible to try to draw conclusions about an individual based on a date of birth. \u201cThere are people at 80 who perform better than 20-year-olds,\u201d said Christopher Van Dyck of Yale University, \u201ceven on these cognitive speed, memory-type tasks.\u201d Furthermore, beyond decades of a healthy diet and sufficient exercise, a significant, intangible, practically mysterious part of the nature of anybody\u2019s aging, said Tracy Chippendale of New York University, is just \u2026 luck. Genes. Joe Biden\u2019s father died at 86. His mother died at 92. People, said Denise Park of the University of Texas at Dallas, have to make a determination \u201cbased on the behavior that they observe.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s essentially what Biden\u2019s repeatedly asked voters to do.\n\n\u201cWatch me,\u201d he said in June. \u201cJust watch me.\u201d\n\nOver the last six weeks, in three of the most important states in the primary process, I watched him \u2014 in South Carolina, in New Hampshire, and here in first-to-caucus Iowa.\n\nIn Prole, in an oversized lakeside gazebo, I watched him talk about the 1951 Chevy he drove in high school as he sweat through his shirt. \u201cI think we want to have him in the shade, guys,\u201d said an aide to the cluster of reporters who had gathered around him to ask questions. \u201cI don\u2019t want him standing in the sun again,\u201d said another. Biden was asked if he had thought about pledging to just one term to allay the concerns about his age. \u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Newton, blessedly inside at a renovated brick building that used to be a Maytag plant, I watched him tell a crowd about how he \u201cgot elected as a 29-year-old kid\u201d and how he\u2019s \u201cmet every single major foreign leader that has existed over the last 35 years.\u201d Attendees I talked to, many of whom had white or gray hair themselves, professed to be impressed. \u201cFor a guy that\u2019s as old as he is,\u201d Tom Spidle, 64, teeing up what came out as a backhanded compliment, told me, \u201che looks incredible.\u201d Chuck Walraven, 66, of Oskaloosa agreed. \u201cTo stand up there and talk as much as he did?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s not gonna fall over dead any more than you are, you know what I\u2019m saying? I mean, you could die tomorrow \u2014 right now \u2014 talking to me! He could live to be a hundred.\u201d Bruce Hoffmeier is the same age as Biden. He wore hearing aids and leaned on a cane. \u201cHe\u2019s not too old,\u201d Hoffmeier said on his way out. \u201cHe looks good.\u201d\n\nAnd at Living History Farms, I watched Biden keep working that rope line before turning to catch up with the man I\u2019d overheard tell the young staffer that he\u2019d committed to caucus better than three decades back.\n\nTom Rial of Des Moines was enrolled at the University of Northern Iowa, where he was the president of the student group for Biden. He supported him as well when he ran for the second time in 2007. He\u2019s supporting him again now.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just got stature,\u201d Rial, 52, told me. \u201cStature, maturity and experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good sides of age,\u201d I offered.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been around,\u201d Rial granted.\n\n* * *\n\nWe started freaking out about the age of our presidents because of something that happened exactly 100 years ago this week.\n\nOn October 2, 1919, Woodrow Wilson collapsed in a bathroom at the White House, felled by a stroke that paralyzed his left side and rendered him incapacitated for the last nearly year and a half of his term. He was, the White House head usher would recall, \u201chelpless.\u201d Wilson, 63 when he was stricken, didn\u2019t hold a cabinet meeting for more than seven months. His aides and his wife banded to do the work of the administration while attempting, too, to obscure the extent of his infirmity. But senators and staff who visited him saw \u201can emaciated old man\u201d and \u201ca very old man\u201d who \u201cacted like one.\u201d It was, in the assessment of one of Wilson\u2019s biographers, \u201cthe worst crisis of presidential disability in American history.\u201d\n\nWilson was on the mind of Vice President Richard Nixon more than 30 years later, when President Eisenhower had a heart attack in September of 1955. Eisenhower recovered, enough to run for and win re-election the following fall, standing in open cars, waving to clamoring crowds, convincing the public that \u201csuggestions that he was near death\u2019s door were visibly untrue.\u201d His ailing health in his second term, though, helped stoke the rise of John F. Kennedy, still the youngest president ever elected.\n\nBut the age-related episode the historians and operatives I talked to for this story brought up first unspooled over the course of two weeks in October of 1984.\n\nReagan, the oldest president ever elected until Trump, in the first of the two general election debates against Democratic nominee Walter Mondale that year appeared alarmingly ill-equipped and scatterbrained. He looked, according to Peter Goldman and Tony Fuller of Newsweek in their bookabout the campaign, \u201cto be searching his mind and coming up empty.\u201d He looked \u201cdamaged.\u201d He \u201clooked old,\u201d they wrote. Reagan was 73, and even the typically friendly Wall Street Journal published a front-page article asking if that was too old, quoting a professor of medicine who said Reagan was shifting from \u201cyoung-old\u201d to \u201cold-old.\u201d A pro-Reagan psychologist added, \u201cI\u2019d be concerned to put him into a corporate presidency. I\u2019d be all the more concerned to put him into the U.S. presidency.\u201d All three networks did stories on it as well, airing an especially discomfiting portion of his performance: \u201cThe system is still where it was in regard to the uh, the uh, the uh, the uh \u2026\u201d\n\nIn the second debate, though, Reagan the ex-actor uncorked what even Mondale would acknowledge as \u201cone of the great lines in the history of presidential debates.\u201d Asked by one of the moderators about his age and his ability \u201cto function,\u201d Reagan responded, \u201cI will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d The audience laughed. Mondalelaughed. But he knew he was done.\n\n\u201cThe joke,\u201d Mondale wrote in his memoir, \u201ccompletely disarmed people\u2019s doubts about his age and his capacities and allowed them to think, \u2018He\u2019s okay.\u2019 They wanted Reagan to be okay and now they could believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople didn\u2019t want him to fail,\u201d University of Texas at Austin presidential historian H.W. Brands told me in an email. \u201cHis ability to joke about the issue told them it couldn\u2019t be too serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody laughed,\u201d said longtime Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, who led Mondale\u2019s efforts in Iowa that cycle, \u201cand regardless of what the facts were about whether age was impacting him or not, it was over \u2014 that question was gone.\u201d\n\nBiden called a 24-year-old woman who asked about climate change \u201ckiddo.\u201d She said she found it \u201cpatronizing.\u201d\n\nAge matters. Because health matters. \u201cEventually, something like what happened to Woodrow Wilson is going to happen to us again,\u201d Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019ve seen almost everything \u2014 an assassination, two impeachments \u2014 in all my years as a watcher of politics. But I\u2019ve never seen a president die of natural causes in office \u2014 and, you know, we\u2019re due.\u201d But voters don\u2019t think like actuaries. Especially not right now. Democrats just want to beat Trump, and polls still say they think Biden\u2019s the best bet.\n\nAlso, the challenge for Mondale in the scenario in \u201984 looks in retrospect like a version of what Biden\u2019s opponents are dealing with now: He had to try to diminish Reagan while simultaneously showing something along the lines of deference. The late Pat Caddell, the madcap mastermind who that year was an adviser to Mondale, understood how delicate a task it was and how hard it would be. Mondale, he reasoned in a strategy memo, had to \u201cconvince voters that Reagan has \u2018lost it\u2019 and that he ought to be retired. \u2026 In short, we want to have the American electorate emulate the British electorate in 1945 when they turned on Winston Churchill.\u201d Still, the hit had to be deft. He all but likened it to putting a family elder in a nursing home \u2014 \u201csort of embracing a grandfather,\u201d Caddell wrote, \u201cand gently pushing him aside.\u201d\n\nMondale couldn\u2019t do it, and none of the younger 2020 candidates have managed it yet with Biden, either.\n\n* * *\n\nLast month in New Hampshire, in Laconia, on the top floor of \u201cthe oldest unaltered brick textile mill in the U.S.,\u201d according to the adjacent historical marker, I watched Biden tell people the salary for a senator back when he was first elected was $42,000 a year, briefly mix up Reagan with Nixon, and refer to Charlottesville as Charlotte before correcting himself two and a half minutes later.\n\n\u201cI found the vice president inspiring,\u201d David Huot told me outside. Almost eight months older than Biden, he\u2019s still a state representative. \u201cWhy the hell should I say he\u2019s old?\u201d Huot said. \u201cI\u2019m old.\u201d\n\nMore often than not, though, I didn\u2019t even have to ask about age.\n\nAfter Huot, for instance, I met Dr. Paul Sapir, 91, and his wife, Sylvia, 76, Rhode Island residents with a nearby summer home, and asked them open-endedly what they thought of Biden\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cI was very impressed,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been very worried about him in terms of his gaffes, but he seemed to know facts and figures, and they seemed to come to him easily.\u201d Her husband, a retired psychiatrist, joined in. \u201cIt was quite reassuring about him and his intactness and his coherence,\u201d he said. \u201cHe seems pretty intact.\u201d\n\nIntact. Sapir sounded like an archeologist describing a papyrus scroll.\n\nThat evening, in nippy New Castle over on the Atlantic coast, a man stoodat the rear of the crowd in an oceanfront park and poked fun with a held-high sign welcoming Biden back to Vermont. In the question-and-answer session after his talk, Biden called a 24-year-old woman who asked about climate change \u201ckiddo.\u201d She said she found it \u201cpatronizing.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, at the state Democratic Party convention at the sports arena in downtown Manchester, Biden was the first of all the presidential candidates to take the stage. The crowd was still sparse. He stifled coughs. By far the most memorable part of his speech was when he called Donald Trump \u201cDonald Hump.\u201d\n\nPeople snickered.\n\nBiden adlibbed. \u201cFreudian slip,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden remains the candidate to beat \u2014 in spite of the softening of his standing in some polls.\n\nThe malaprop made for a droplet of entertainment. But the more meaningful development of the day, it seemed, happened not out in the open hall but rather in the bowels of the venue, in a stuffy, fluorescent-lit room, in which the roster of Oval Office aspirants could come talk to the assembled throng of reporters. Biden opted not to show up. Virtually everybody else did, though, and what unfolded in his absence was a collective crescendo of talk about the age issue \u2014 a preview of sorts of what would come the following week during and after the Houston debate. Ryan, 46, pointed to \u201ca lack of clarity\u201d in the way Biden speaks. Buttigieg, 37, said Democrats traditionally win the presidency with new, fresh faces, not \u201cestablished and Washington-tenured figures.\u201d Booker, 50, managed to turn a question about climate change into a chance to call attention to his relative youth. \u201cI\u2019ve seen military reports about what\u2019s going to happen in the next 25 years \u2014 when, as another one of my colleagues says, I will still be younger than the president of the United States.\u201d And Castro, days before he would unleash toward Biden his \u201cforgetting\u201d fusillade, was explicit. \u201cI believe that we need a new generation of leadership,\u201d he said, citing party presidential antecedents Kennedy, Carter, Clinton and Obama. \u201cI believe people are looking for that again.\u201d\n\nBiden, however, remains the candidate to beat \u2014 in spite of the softening of his standing in some polls.\n\nOlder political hands think they know why.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly all right to call for a new generation of leadership,\u201d longtime Democratic strategist Bob Shrum told me. But he warned of \u201cthe danger of trying to go after Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is,\u201d former top Obama strategist David Axelrod emailed, \u201ca lot of affection and respect among Democrats for Biden. He is popular. Gratuitous attacks on him are not well received. And in an environment in which defeating Trump is the urgent concern of many Democrats, Biden seems like the safest, least risky choice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why Joe Trippi looks at the 2020 primary to this point and finds himself thinking back to the 2010 California gubernatorial campaign. Jerry Brown was pitted against Meg Whitman. Trippi worked for Brown. Whitman was 54 and was coming off a decade of having been the CEO of eBay. Brown, on the other hand, had been around for just about forever, and had done just about everything \u2014 governor already before, mayor of Oakland, attorney general, three times a presidential candidate. He was 72. But the political terrain in the state coming out of eight years with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and in the wake of the Great Recession was jangled. Trippi was \u201cblown away\u201d by what he learned from voters in focus groups.\n\n\u201cWe would give them this really stellar bio of Meg Whitman, and they all went, \u2018No way.\u2019 And you\u2019re like, \u2018What?\u2019 And it was like, \u2018No way \u2014 we tried somebody from outside government who didn\u2019t know what the hell they were doing. \u2026 It was just too chaotic. We don\u2019t want anybody new. We don\u2019t want anybody from outside. Just somebody who knows how to turn the lights on in Sacramento. \u2026 Can\u2019t you just give me an old shoe? I just want an old shoe.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the case of that race, Trippi explained, they won by looking not forward so much as back.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what\u2019s at work right now.\n\n\u201cWith age comes experience,\u201d he said, \u201cand with a chaotic president, the experience may count more than the age.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nIt may. But that's the exception to the rule. Usually it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nIn 1972, for example, Cale Boggs was a two-term U.S. senator from Delaware. He was 63. Reporters in their coverage of the campaign described his \u201cthinning hair\u201d and said he sometimes got \u201ctongue-tied.\u201d\n\nHis challenger, meanwhile, a one-term county councilman, was 29. Reporters called Joe Biden \u201cboyishly slim\u201d and noted that he often talked about \u201chow the old guard has bungled things.\u201d\n\nI was thinking about Delaware and 1972 a few weeks ago as I pulled in to park in a pecan orchard on the banks of the Little Pee Dee River in rural South Carolina. The first thing I saw on the door of a car was a big placard of a magnet bearing a rendering of the face of Pete Buttigieg. \u201cWe can\u2019t look for greatness,\u201d it said, \u201cin the past.\u201d\n\nUp the road a short way, outside the Galivants Ferry general store, vendors in trucks and tents hawked sweet tea, pimento cheese sliders and six-buck chicken bog. A bluegrass band was picking on the porch not far from the lectern made to look like a stump. Sticking out in the growing crowd was a ruddy man wearing flip-flops and a \u201cMAKE AMERICA GROOVE AGAIN\u201d hat and carrying a sign saying he was a \u201cREPUBLICAN FOR PETE.\u201d\n\n\u201cMayor Pete\u2019s a selfless servant,\u201d John Dabrowski told me. He\u2019s 37, lives on Pawleys Island and works in sales at a brewery in Myrtle Beach. He\u2019s not happy with Trump, whom he called \u201ca bully.\u201d After his wife, Peta, got turned on to Buttigieg by drinking wine and watching YouTube videos, Dabrowski, too, identified the alternative he was looking for. He thinks Buttigieg is the person who can beat the president. \u201cWe can\u2019t put somebody that\u2019s gonna ostracize Republicans that are moderates like me, fiscal conservatives but also super liberal in other, you know, social aspects.\u201d\n\nBut what about Biden?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s old guard. I believe in term limits, and Joe\u2019s not gonna do it for me. I mean, we don\u2019t need somebody that\u2019s been doing it for all these years. I want somebody that\u2019s gonna be around for the policies that they\u2019re gonna write, OK? Mayor Pete, if we put in some type of green policy or some type of coal policy, he\u2019s going to see the repercussions because he\u2019s going to be around for it. Biden\u2019s not gonna be around for 30 years to see the effects of his policies \u2014 and that matters to me. Doesn\u2019t that carry more weight? I want somebody to be living with their policy.\u201d\n\nDabrowski\u2019s friend chimed in. Buttigieg \u201cwill be president,\u201d said Ree Lawson, 54, a high school debate and public speaking teacher in Waccamaw. \u201cIt might not be this time.\u201d But next time? Or the time after that? And after that? \u201cWe could go through four more cycles. He could run and still be a young man.\u201d\n\nOn the docket for the evening at the Galivants Ferry Stump \u2014 where Democrats running for office have spoken since shortly after the Civil War \u2014 were four presidential candidates. First was Amy Klobuchar, and last was Bill de Blasio, who was a few days from dropping out \u2014 but in between was one heck of a Biden v. Boggs-like contrast.\n\nButtigieg, who was five years old when Biden first ran for president, bounded to his spot behind the stump, dressed in his uniform of dark slacks and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up.\n\n\u201cThis is a time to unify the American people. This is a time for ideas that are bold enough to get the job done and capable of bringing us together. And if you think about it, that\u2019s how Democrats win, from John F. Kennedy to Jimmy Carter to Bill Clinton to Barack Obama. We win when we offer leadership from a new generation, with new ideas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAre you ready to break from the past?\u201d\n\nThe cheer that went up from the people suggested that they were.\n\nThen, though, led to the stump by a stomping, gyrating, instrument-waggling troupe from Florence, the energetic marching band from that city\u2019s Wilson High, Biden was ready to respond. He spoke for his allotted 20 minutes, a faster, localized version of his standard spiel, citing another senator he once worked with (the recently deceased Fritz Hollings of South Carolina), stressing \u201chonesty,\u201d \u201cdignity\u201d and \u201cdecency,\u201d and extolling Obama not as one of the series of fresh-faced Democrats who won the White House but as the president he served.\n\n\u201cFolks,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna say it. I don\u2019t think we thank Barack Obama enough for the job he did as president!\u201d\n\nThe audience roared. Biden built to a crescendo of his own. Grabbing hold of a past that never fails to invigorate him, he clenched his fist.
