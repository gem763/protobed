The company on Sept. 19 outlined its own plan that will pay $17.9 billion for wildfire claims and caps payouts to victims at $8.4 billion and to insurers at $8.5 billion.\n\nEarlier this month, the company reached an $11 billion settlement to resolve most claims by insurance carriers related to the wildfires.\n\nAt the time of its Chapter 11 filing in January, PG&E projected it could face more than $30 billion in liabilities from wildfires, including last year's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire of California's modern history.", "description": "PG&E noteholders ready to invest $29.2 billion as part of reorganization plan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8P04X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
