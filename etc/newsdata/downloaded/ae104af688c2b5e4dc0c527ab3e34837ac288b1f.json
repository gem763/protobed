I still admire the way he dealt with the racism that was aimed at him when he was a player.\n\nThe picture of him backheeling a banana off the pitch at Goodison Park in 1988 is one of the most powerful images of the time. Barnes was a pioneer in football's fight against ignorance, a fight he handled with dignity and grace.\n\nI admire some of what he says about the same issues now, too. I agree with him when he says that fighting racism is just as much about dealing with what people think as what they say. I am also aware that it would be strange indeed for me, a white, middle-class, middle-aged, middle-of-the-road journalist to lecture him on what he should think about race.\n\nThe image of John Barnes backheeling a banana off the pitch at Goodison Park is still powerful\n\nI'm not going to do that. But when I heard Barnes on talkSport on Thursday night, arguing passionately that there was nothing wrong with Bernardo Silva tweeting a picture of a thick-lipped, dark-skinned cartoon character used to advertise a Spanish brand of chocolate peanuts called Conguitos and likening it to a picture of Benjamin Mendy, it made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nWe might as well be honest about this: there is zero similarity between the young Mendy and the Conguitos cartoon. It is not a likeness. It is not a caricature. It is not an approximation.\n\nI accept that Silva's intentions were not malicious but he might as well have put a picture of the golliwog from the Robertson's Jam label next to the image of Mendy. The effect would have been the same.\n\nPep Guardiola attempted to excuse Silva by saying he speaks five languages. Maybe he has six fingers, too. I don't know. It doesn't matter.\n\nHe could speak 20 languages and have a thousand telephones that don't ring and it wouldn't change the fact that juxtaposing those images on Twitter carried historical and cultural connotations in this country of which he was clearly unaware.\n\nBernardo Silva faced an angry backlash after posting this image on Twitter on Sunday\n\nI would not accuse Bernardo of being a racist. Nor would I argue he should be banned from playing. The advertising image used by Conguitos is culturally acceptable in Spain and Portugal.\n\nIt sells more than 30 million packets annually so there is little offence taken elsewhere. But here, because of our history, perhaps, it is different.\n\nAt a time when incidences of racism in football are on the rise again, when black players are routinely abused on social media and when Bernardo's City team-mate Raheem Sterling has been singled out for abuse inside and outside stadiums, it would have been better if Guardiola had formulated a response that went beyond: 'Nothing to see here.'\n\nWe have seen before that there is a fairly high bar for what offends managers when it comes to something one of their own players has done.\n\nRichard Keogh, Mason Bennett, Tom Lawrence et al appear to have just about cleared it at Derby County by smashing up two cars and filling a urinal with vomit but Silva, it seems, is very much in the clear with his boss.\n\nPep Guardiola defended Bernardo by talking up his character and ability to speak languages\n\nThere is still reason to think that in all other regards Bernardo may indeed be the 'exceptional person' Guardiola says he is. But when City have done so much good work around racism and have spoken so well on behalf of Sterling when he has been the subject of racist abuse, Guardiola's stance on the issue feels discordant.\n\nIt is the same with Barnes. Hearing him on the radio made me feel uncomfortable not just because of what he was saying but because I know that a man I still regard as an icon is in the process of trashing his reputation with the community he fought so hard to stand up for.\n\nHe is entitled to dismiss what I think but when his views are increasingly at odds with those now leading the fight against discrimination, it ought to give him pause for thought.\n\nBarnes has amassed a canon of work in this area that includes saying he thought Liam Neeson should be given a medal for his honesty in admitting he once entertained the idea of murdering a random black man, suggesting that highly paid footballers like Jadon Sancho should think about the discrimination less privileged black men and women face when they complain about abuse from the terraces and now saying he thinks it would be wrong were Bernardo to be punished for his tweet.\n\nSome of this, frankly, seems perverse. Barnes always argues with great conviction but it is hard to believe he cannot appreciate there is a wider context to images like the Conguitos cartoon.\n\nBarnes' views are increasingly at odds with those now leading the fight against discrimination\n\nYou do not have to be a super-vigilant advocate of political correctness to find a quasi-comic image of a little brown man-child from the Congo with thick, bright red lips, bulging eyes and a round belly redolent of an imperialist past when black people were regarded as an inferior, subservient race to be mocked and enslaved.\n\n'Barnes makes it harder for me to live my life as a black man,' the young writer Carl Anka wrote on The Athletic website last week. 'Both in the professional sense, trying to work in football, and in the personal one, trying to exist in the United Kingdom.\n\n'His default position of 'it's society's problem' makes him an easy rent-a-quote for people looking to silence others. Again and again, Barnes is there, ridiculing the racism that young black men face. To see a man who enlivened a generation of black football fans repeatedly silence the voices of another hurts immeasurably.'\n\nLook at the Barnes fan club on social media and the vast majority of them are white men. What Bernardo Silva did was far from the worst thing in the world. It was nothing the apology he has made to the FA would not fix.\n\nWhat was harder to countenance was the rush to defend him and the thought of how many real racists that will enable.\n\nYou're hilarious, Jose\n\nIt has not taken long for Jose Mourinho to prostitute himself to a gambling firm now that he is out of work but at least we know now he has got a sense of humour.\n\nActually, we knew that already. Because we have seen him sitting in a television studio saying he doesn't take any pleasure from the position Manchester United are in and saying it as if he had absolutely nothing to do with it.\n\nBefore the revisionism about his time at Old Trafford really kicks in, let's not forget United had won seven from 17 when he was sacked last season, were languishing in sixth and heading south.\n\nEd Woodward and the Glazers might be the architects of United's decline but Mourinho made the mess even worse. For him to sit there and pretend that never happened is very funny.\n\nJose Mourinho has shown his sense of humour by appearing in a new gambling commercial\n\nWhen we're talking about Derby's start to the season, 'car crash' just about covers it.\n\nA new manager who has only won two of his first nine games and a group of players who turn a team-bonding bender into a cross between a video nasty and an episode of Wacky Races.\n\nTwo players charged with drink-driving and the skipper, Richard Keogh, suffering a knee injury in the accident that happened when he, Mason Bennett and Tom Lawrence ignored cars laid on by the club to take them home.\n\nTo cap it off, they named Tom Huddlestone as skipper only to find out he had filmed Bennett vomiting in a urinal.", "description": "OLIVER HOLT - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER: I still have huge respect for John Barnes.
