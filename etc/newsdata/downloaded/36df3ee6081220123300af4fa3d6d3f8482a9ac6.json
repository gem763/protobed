According to the Associated Press, Carrey has co-written a novel with Dana Vachon titled Memoirs and Misinformation, which is described as a \u201cfearless and semiautobiographical deconstruction of persona.\u201d The book\u2019s publisher, Knopf, went further in a press release, explaining that the authors \u201chave fashioned a narrative about acting, Hollywood, agents, celebrity, privilege, friendship, loneliness, romance, addiction to relevance, fear of personal erasure, growing up in Canada, and a cataclysmic ending of the world \u2014 apocalypses within and without,\u201d with Carrey himself adding, \u201cNone of this is real and all of it is true.\u201d [Scratches head.]\n\nMemoirs and Misinformation is slated to be released sometime next May, and Carrey plans to go on tour to promote it. In the meantime, Carrey returns to Showtime next month with the season-two premiere of Kidding on Sunday, November 10. Just a few months later he\u2019ll return to the big screen as Dr. Robotnik in the Sonic movie, which was delayed after fans watched the trailer and really, really, really didn\u2019t like how their beloved hedgehog was portrayed onscreen. (Oh God, the teeth. The teeth.) Hopefully, director Jeff Fowler\u2019s decision to listen to the complaints of what Carrey called \u201cthe collective consciousness\u201d ends up being a good call.", "description": "Jim Carrey has co-written a novel titled \u2018Memoirs and Misinformation.\u2019 It will be published by Knopf and hit stores next May.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-jim-carrey.w1200.h630.jpg"}
