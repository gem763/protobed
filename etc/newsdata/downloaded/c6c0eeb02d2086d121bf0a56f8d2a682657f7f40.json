As Manchester City\u2019s premier defender came to terms with months of knee rehabilitation ahead, the need for the \u00a363million midfielder to move backward seemed somewhat far-fetched.\n\nThat has changed dramatically. Here was Rodri, alongside Fernandinho, in a back four costing towards \u00a3200m but unfathomably not boasting a central specialist. Both John Stones and Eric Garcia sat on the bench.\n\nRodri was forced to play at centre-back role because of Manchester City's defensive injuries\n\nFernandinho played in defence once again with John Stones only fit enough for the bench\n\nPep Guardiola will have his reasons for this. Stones, he argued, is still not fully fit and appears likely to play against Atalanta in the Champions League on Tuesday instead. Nicolas Otamendi suffered a kick to the back while on international duty with Argentina. Garcia is a real prospect but inexperienced, with only one Premier League substitute appearance to his name.\n\nEqually, City were always going to enjoy plenty of uncontested possession near their own goal. So while the selection felt bizarre at the time \u2013 one of Guardiola\u2019s \u201chave you seen this?\u201d line-ups \u2013 it was perhaps unsurprising in the grand scheme. Stones has also struggled for form when fit, and Crystal Palace\u2019s rigid five across midfield meant the prospect of sustained scrutiny was minimal.\n\nRodri has played there before as a youngster, albeit very occasionally. Interestingly, he has spoken openly about the difficulty of understanding the sheer amount of \u2018transitions\u2019 as a holding midfielder in this division, and you wonder whether the odd outing in defence might better help his appreciation of that role. That surely will not have entered Guardiola\u2019s thinking, given the points disparity with leaders Liverpool and desperate need for victory.\n\nPep Guardiola's men won against Crystal Palace despite the defensive readjustments\n\nThe Rodri-Fernandinho axis feels like Guardiola\u2019s hundredth defensive double-act already this season and Palace simply did not pressurise City\u2019s untried pairing enough.\n\nFor two men so comfortable on the ball, Fernandinho and Rodri did over-play on their own 18-yard line at one stage. Rodri, who made a super block from Patrick van Aanholt\u2019s goalbound effort, intercepted the ball intelligently in the main and the 23-year-old\u2019s reading of the game actually coincided with his most unfortunate moment of this.\n\nBenjamin Mendy had gallivanted into midfield and lost possession. Rodri, aware of a Palace counter developing, protected the yawning gap opened by Mendy\u2019s absence, but his eagerness to cover the left back saw him slip. Fortunately for both of them, Raheem Sterling raced back to track and eventually thwart the galloping Wilfried Zaha.\n\nGoing direct more often might have been profitable for Palace. Strangely, Christian Benteke remained on the bench until minute 76. Seconds later, he forced Ederson into a stunning save when climbing above Rodri at a corner. On came Stones shortly after and Rodri went into midfield.
