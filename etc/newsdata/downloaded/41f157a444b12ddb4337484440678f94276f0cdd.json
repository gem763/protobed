Saudi Arabia pumped about 9.78 million barrels per day (bpd) in August.\n\nStill, OPEC's output fell to the lowest in eight years in September at 28.9 million bpd, down 750,000 bpd from August's revised figure and the lowest monthly total since 2011, a separate Reuters survey found.\n\nOutput at the world's two largest producers, the United States and Russia, also fell in July and September, respectively.\n\nRussia's output declined to 11.24 million bpd in Sept. 1-29, down from 11.29 million bpd in the previous month, sources said, although it is still above the quotas set in an output deal between Russia and OPEC.\n\nU.S. crude oil output fell 276,000 bpd in July to 11.81 million bpd as federal offshore Gulf of Mexico production slid, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration monthly report released on Monday.\n\nU.S. production peaked at 12.12 million bpd in April.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. crude oil stockpiles likely rose 1.1 million barrels last week, while distillate stocks probably slipped, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.", "description": "Oil prices recover after output from U.S., Russia, OPEC drop", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF901T5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
