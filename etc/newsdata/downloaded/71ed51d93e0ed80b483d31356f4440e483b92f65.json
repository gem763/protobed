Arsenal are England champions, with players who were second in the World Cup, so for us it was a very tough situation. That is football. I hope in the future we will have groups, it will increase the level. We didn\u2019t have a chance against Arsenal but in a group maybe we could do something better.\u201d\n\nFiorentina, though, while not the toughest opponents the Gunners could have drawn, were not the easiest on paper either. In their third year in the competition, though having not progressed past the last 16, they readied themselves for the Arsenal onslaught, a back four swiftly reverting into a back five and sometimes six. That meant Arsenal struggled, despite controlling possession, to find the space to shoot in the opening phase of play.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal captain Kim Little was also on the scoresheet.

Less than 20 minutes in and Little sprung Miedema free in the box \u2013 she dropped a shoulder, switched on to her right foot and hesitated before swiping past Francesca Durante as she fell off balance.\u201cI struggled a bit with the pitch today,\u201d laughed Miedema. \u201cI fell over a couple of times, it was quite sticky. I don\u2019t know, I saw a little spot in the goal and I just knew I had to go there, so even when I did fall over I could still get it there.\u201d\n\nManchester City hit Lugano for second-half six in Champions League thrashing Read more\n\nThe home side\u2019s best play came from Lisa De Vanna, Janelle Cordia and Frederikke Th\u00f8rgersen dancing triangles down the right and catching out Katie McCabe. But just past the half-hour Arsenal had a second. Little and Miedema played a one-two to outfox a dishevelled back line and put the Scot clean through to stroke past Durante.\n\nArsenal\u2019s versatility helped them through a testing period of injury last season. Here though, the versatility was used as Montemurro has always intended it, to create a fluidity to their play.\u201cObviously we built the squad for that versatility, for that ability to rotate things, to play our football. You need to understand that we had 14 players away with national teams last week, a lot of them played 90 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt was inevitable that the games would catch up on us, so it was good that we could get the game under control and then make the necessary substitutions.\u201d\n\nThe former Gunner Janni Arnth handed Arsenal their third on a plate. The centre-back, who joined from Arsenal in the summer, dawdled in the box and Miedema pounced, driving low past Durante.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of the Arsenal fans at Stadio Artemio Franchi.

It was enough to make Montemurro feel able to rest some legs and off came Miedema, who missed Arsenal\u2019s season opener against West Ham with a knock, for Jordan Nobbs to get some vital minutes in her recovered knee, as the clock ran down on what was considered one of the toughest ties in the round. Miedema was glad for the rest: \u201cWe\u2019ve got Man United coming up on Monday and I just need to recover well and be ready for that game,\u201d she said.", "description": "Arsenal striker Vivianne Miedema scored twice to lead the team to a 4-0 first-leg victory against Fiorentina in the Women\u2019s Champions League", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50fafc9ac2615567461c3523b43c56eac0e3a80c/0_325_4190_2514/master/4190.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e4620a3bacef13a4a31c0bce2f730a63"}
