In Katy Perry\u2019s new video for \u201cHarleys in Hawaii,\u201d she\u2019s all about steamier locations. The pop singer treats us to visuals of her riding a motorcycle through Hawaiian fields in a leather jacket, which honestly is not very tropical. But, as this is a Katy Perry music video, she eventually seduces a hot mystery biker man (don\u2019t tell Orlando Bloom) on the beach. Then \u2026 parties with her girlfriends while eating hot Cheetos and smashing guitars? All totally Hawaiian activities, to be sure. On the song itself, Perry enlisted fellow pop star Charlie Puth for some help with writing and production, just like she did for previous single \u201cSmall Talk.\u201d While we\u2019re glad Katy got a fun Hawaiian vacation out of this one, let\u2019s hope she gets back to work on a new album soon.\n\nRelated", "description": "Katy Perry released \u201cHarleys in Hawaii,\u201d her third solo single since her 2017 album Witness, written and produced with fellow pop star Charlie Puth.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/16/16-katy-perry.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
