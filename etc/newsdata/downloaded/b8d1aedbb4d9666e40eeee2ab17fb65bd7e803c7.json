Otherwise, they would withdraw support and thus defeat Trudeau, forcing another election.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t forget the Conservatives. If the pipeline was at stake in a some kind of cooked-up vote, they might very well back the Liberals. They should, if their interest is the economy rather than just power,\u201d Braid wrote in his column.\n\nWe may not be so divided after all.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know this morning:\n\nStatistics Canada to release retail trade figures for August at 8:30 a.m. ET\n\nStatistics Canada to release retail trade figures for August at 8:30 a.m. ET Bank of Canada to release its business outlook survey and senior loan officer survey at 10:30 a.m. ET\n\nCorporate Earnings: Aimia Inc., Canadian National Railway Co.\n\nThe economy is in trouble and it\u2019s going to take politicians doing difficult things to encourage growth, writes Kevin Carmichael.\n\n\u201cTrudeau would have to acknowledge that Conservatives won 34 per cent of the popular vote, compared with about 33 per cent for his Liberals,\u201d Carmichael wrote. \u201cExcept that about 65 per cent of voters endorsed parties that support a carbon tax, which Scheer said he would scrap, so the Conservatives were put on notice too.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Please send your news, comments and stories to yhussain@postmedia.com. \u2014\n\nYadullah Hussain @yad_Fpenergy\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press, Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg", "description": "Stuff you need to know", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/liberals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
