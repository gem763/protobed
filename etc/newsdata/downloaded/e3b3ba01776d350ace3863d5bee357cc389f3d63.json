Murray defeated Stan Wawrinka in three sets to claim the European Open title.\n\nWhat a difference nine months makes.\n\nIt was early January that Murray broke down in a pre-Australian Open press conference and tearfully announced he could have played his last game.\n\nThe 31-year-old Scottish star said he\u2019d hoped to be able to get to Wimbledon in the middle of the year \u2014 when he planned to retire \u2014 but his body let him down but not before a five-set classic.\n\nStream live coverage of the WTA and ATP Tours with ESPN and beIN SPORTS on KAYO.

We\u2019re all really happy. I\u2019m sad I lost today but I\u2019m really happy to see you back.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an amazing champion and you deserve that. I\u2019ve lost today but in general, it was a great week.\u201d\n\nBut it was just the tip of the iceberg as the world rained down praise on the returning champion.\n\nIt is absolutely wonderful to see @andy_murray healthy and back in the winner\u2019s circle.
