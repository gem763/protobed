An investigation is underway.\n\nA message left Saturday seeking additional comment on the discovery was not returned by the Will County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigations department.\n\nKlopfer, who died Sept. 3, was a longtime doctor at an abortion clinic in South Bend, Indiana. It closed after the state revoked the clinic\u2019s license in 2015. The Indiana State Department of Health had previously issued complaints against the clinic, accusing it of lacking a registry of patients, policies regarding medical abortion, and a governing body to determine policies.\n\nThe state agency also accused the clinic of failing to document that patients get state-mandated education at least 18 hours before an abortion.\n\nKlopfer was believed to be Indiana\u2019s most prolific abortion doctor, with thousands of procedures performed in multiple Indiana counties over several decades, the South Bend Tribune reported.\n\nMike Fichter, the president of Indiana Right to Life, said in a statement sent Friday night that \u201cwe are horrified\u201d by the discovery of the fetal remains at Klopfer\u2019s Illinois residence. He called for Indiana authorities to help determine whether those remains have any connection to abortion operations in Indiana.\n\n\u201cThese sickening reports underscore why the abortion industry must be held to the highest scrutiny,\u201d Fichter said in the statement.\n\nA message left Saturday by The Associated Press for a spokesman for Gov. Eric Holcomb asking if Indiana officials would investigate was not immediately returned.\n\nKlopfer\u2019s license was suspended by Indiana\u2019s Medical Licensing Board in November 2016 after the panel found a number of violations, including a failure to ensure that qualified staff was present when patients received or recovered from medications given before and during abortion procedures.\n\nKlopfer was no longer practicing by that time, but he told the panel he had never lost a patient in 43 years of doing abortions and that he hoped to eventually re-open his clinics.\n\nIn June 2014, Klopfer was charged in St. Joseph County, Indiana, with a misdemeanor for failure to file a timely public report. He was accused of waiting months to report an abortion he provided to a 13-year-old girl in South Bend. That charge was later dropped after Klopfer completed a pre-trial diversion program.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Jackie Walorski, R-Indiana, called the discovery of the fetal remains \u201csickening beyond words\u201d in a statement released by her office.\n\n\u201cHe was responsible for thousands of abortions in Indiana, and his careless treatment of human remains is an outrage,\u201d she said in her statement.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Indiana law requiring the burial or cremation of fetal remains following abortions in the state. That law was signed by Vice President Mike Pence in 2016 when he was Indiana\u2019s governor, but it was the subject of legal challenges.\n\nThe Indiana State Department of Health, which oversees abortion clinic regulation, has integrated that law\u2019s provisions into the agency\u2019s existing licensing process.\n\nPrior to the ruling, Indiana clinics could turn over fetal remains to processors who handle the disposal of human tissues or other medical material by incineration.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "More than 2,000 medically preserved fetal remains have been found at the Illinois home of Ulrich Klopfer, a former Indiana abortion clinic doctor who died last week, authorities said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/fetal_remains_doctor_95978_c74-0-2000-1123_s1770x1032.jpg?4019589b94b1b4b8f56e50b4f14bcb23193c1bbe", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
