Excessive sitting is associated with the development of the 'big three' killer diseases: diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Obesity and weight gain: Human metabolism as good as shuts down when you sit for too long, which leads to significant weight gain, metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes. Back pain: Excessive sitting can cause chronic back and neck pain, and make existing conditions worse. Depression: Prolonged lack of physical activity leads to mental issues like depression and anxiety. Low energy and reduced productivity: Sitting all day may be the cause of the dreaded 'afternoon slump'. Many standing desk users report an increase in energy, concentration and productivity.\n\nIn recent years, standing desks have been hailed as the antidote to sitting-related disease.\n\nStanding for half a work day has been found to reduce blood pressure, improve circulation and increase productivity by 43 percent.\n\nAlternating between sitting and standing also burned an additional 200 calories per day, which equates to a staggering 48,000 calories per year.\n\nThat's the equivalent of cycling 1,500 kilometres, swimming 170 kilometres or running more than 18 marathons.\n\nStanding for half the work day has been found to increase productivity, improve circulation and reduce blood pressure (stock image)\n\nHow to build more movement into a day at the office 1. Get a standing desk: Standing desks are having their moment in the sun, with a wide variety now available including treadmill desks, bike desks and desktop converters for your existing desk. Switch from sitting to standing with the aim of standing for half your working day overall. StartStanding.org recommends standing on a shiatsu mat to stimulate nerves and relax muscles in your feet. 2. Park further from the entrance at work: Or, if you take public transport, hop off one stop early to build your daily step count. 3. Stand up for phone calls: Walking while talking on the phone is an easy way to increase your movement at work. According to a study from the University of Utah's School of Medicine, walking for just two minutes each hour may reduce the damage of extended periods of sitting. 4. Arrange walking meetings: Speak to your boss and colleagues about organising walking meetings outdoors. In terms of brain function, walking at any given pace has been found to improve working memory and recall, according to a study from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. 5. Exercise before work or during lunch: Set your alarm an hour early and kick start your metabolism with a morning gym session before work. If you can't peel yourself out of the sheets, find a studio nearby and head for a 30 minute workout during lunch. The Australian Health Department advises adults to engage in anywhere from two and a half to five hours of moderate physical activity, or one hour and fifteen minutes to two and a half hours of vigorous activity, each week. 6. Go for a stroll after lunch: StartStanding.org suggests taking a walk shortly after eating to improve digestion. 7. Drink plenty of water: Dietary guidelines advise adults to drink between two and three litres of water each day - equivalent to roughly eight glasses. Drinking plenty of water not only improves hydration, but also increases the number of bathroom breaks you'll take. Try walking to a bathroom on a floor above or below you, taking the stairs. 8. Avoid the lift: Take the stairs where possible. If you work tens of floors above ground, start by taking five flights and build up gradually. 9. Invest in a fitness tracker: Wearing a FitBit or similar movement tracker gives instant access to calories consumed and burned, steps taken and other important bodily functions like sleep quality and heart rate.\n\nGiving standing desks to 20 percent of all Australian office workers would save $84 million in healthcare costs by reducing obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, a 2018 study by the National Health and Medical Research Council found.\n\nResearch co-author Professor David Dunstan from the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute said it's time to change people's attitude to how they work.\n\n'If you can shift people's time spent sitting in total across the day, that can lower the risk of complications like heart disease and diabetes in the longer term,' he told ABC.\n\n'[It's also] the associated support, so to support individuals and organisations to facilitate changes in the workplace to be more conducive to less sitting, more standing, more movement throughout the day.\n\n'A key message from this study is that it's not only about, \"Here's your desk, go for it\". It's about providing the workstations and then coaching people on how to achieve a feasible approach to changing their sitting and standing throughout the day.'", "description": "It's well known that living a sedentary lifestyle leads to weight gain and generally poor health, but sobering new Australian statistics reveal the extent of the damage prolonged sitting has on our health.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/07/19240318-0-image-a-68_1570082703585.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
