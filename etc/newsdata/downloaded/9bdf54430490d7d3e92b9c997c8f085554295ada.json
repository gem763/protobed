Photo: jjwithers/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nMy friend has a Labradoodle named Oliver. Oliver is big, blond, and beautiful \u2014 a canine Armie Hammer type, I\u2019d say \u2014 which is why it pains me to say the following: Oliver, you were a mistake, a \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s monster,\u201d a perversion of science who should never have been brought into this world.\n\nI\u2019m sorry!! I don\u2019t feel that way, of course, but Wally Conron, the creator of the Labradoodle, does. As Conron told ABC Australia this week, the hybrid breed is one of his greatest regrets. He originally developed Labradoodles 30 years ago, when he was working as the breeding manager for the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia, after a blind woman in Hawaii contacted the association asking if they could breed a dog that could serve as her service animal, but without triggering her husband\u2019s dog allergies. Conron found a suitable standard poodle, bred it with a guide-dog Labrador bitch, and in 1989, the first litter of Labradoodles was born. One of the three puppies, Sultan, went to work with the woman in Hawaii.\n\nSoon, Labradoodle popularity skyrocketed, but Conron quickly saw that other breeders were not as scrupulous about breeding as he was.\n\n\u201cI realized what I had done within a matter of days,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cI realized the reason for these unethical, ruthless people [was] to breed these dogs and sell them for big bucks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI opened a Pandora\u2019s box and released a Frankenstein\u2019s monster,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, decades on, Conron says he can\u2019t help but look over the Labradoodles he sees on the street.\n\n\u201cI find that the biggest majority are either crazy or have a hereditary problem. I do see some damn nice Labradoodles but they\u2019re few and far between.\u201d\n\nMany Labradoodle owners don\u2019t share the creator\u2019s concerns, though. In a BBC story about Conron\u2019s remarks, several Labradoodle owners gushed about their pets. Like Barney, whose owner said, \u201cHe has the perfect mix of lovingness, intelligence and everything. When I\u2019m feeling down or stressed, he picks me up, comes for a cuddle and I feel better again.\u201d\n\nWho knows, maybe Conron would feel differently if he met Oliver.
