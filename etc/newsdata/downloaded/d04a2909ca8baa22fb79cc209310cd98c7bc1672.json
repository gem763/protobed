Once the district was notified of the comment, a message was sent to school staff and families, district spokeswoman Tara Thomas told Fox News.\n\nThe district's social media policies warn staffers to \"think twice before posting\" and to not post \"threats of physical or bodily harm.\"\n\nThunberg, 16, has made headlines for her calls to world leaders to take aggressive measures to combat the damaging effects of climate change.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nLast month, she testified before Congress and denounced world leaders at a United Nations summit for an insufficient action plan on climate change.\n\n\"You are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us,\" Thunberg said. \"But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.\u201d\n\nHer blunt nature has also come under criticism. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently said \"no one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and \u2026 people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden.\"\n\nDuring her appearance at the University of Iowa on Friday, she told a cheering crowd \u201cas we all know, the U.N. Climate Action Summit was a failure,\" according to Reuters. \u201cNo matter what, we need to continue.\"", "description": "An Iowa science teacher has been placed\u00a0after posting to social media that he didn't have a \"sniper rifle\" for climate change activist Greta Thunberg before her planned visit to the state.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19270801747789.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
