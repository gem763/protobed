The show will take place next Thursday, October 10th in the University Auditorium at 7pm! pic.twitter.com/I1ISZtt2C2 \u2014 ACCENT Speakers (@accentspeakers) October 1, 2019\n\nThe university faced a tremendous amount of backlash following the announcement, with outraged individuals calling it a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and a \u201cwaste of money.\u201d ACCENT is reportedly paying the pair $50,000 to speak at the event, which comes from students\u2019 activity fees.\n\nThe reaction spurred UF to defend ACCENT\u2019s decision to invite the duo to speak, reiterating its devotion to \u201cfreedom of expression\u201d and ensuring that a \u201cwide variety of viewpoints are heard on campus.\u201d\n\nUF stated:\n\nThe University, in its statement on freedom of expression, has committed itself to ensuring that a wide variety of viewpoints are heard on campus as well as to protecting the First Amendment rights of all those in attendance,\u201d UF said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe University believes it is an essential component of its academic mission to foster an environment where divergent ideas, opinions and philosophies, new and old, can be rigorously discussed and critically evaluated.\u201d\n\nWith Trump and Guilfoyle slated to speak, aggrieved UF students are planning a #ChompTrump protest on the University Auditorium lawn. One event on Facebook, titled \u201cProtest: Say NO to Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle,\u201d claims the pair\u2019s appearance is an \u201cinsult to the multicultural organizations that have had their funds stripped away from them by Student Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoin us at 5:30 PM outside the venue as we #ChompTrump and send a clear message to the Trumps that hatred and bigotry are not welcome on our campus,\u201d the event\u2019s description reads.\n\nOver 400 people marked that they are going to the protest, which begins at 5:30 p.m. EST.\n\n\u201cWe do NOT support the usage of our student fees to fund a Trump campaign event on OUR campus and further promote the hateful rhetoric of this Administration,\u201d one of the posts on the event\u2019s page reads. \u201c#CHOMPTRUMP.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudent fees should NOT be used to fund this toxic event,\u201d another post on the page adds.\n\nAnother group, No Nazis at UF, is demanding UF to cancel the event altogether.\n\nThe group is expected to hold its protest in the Turlington Plaza at 5 p.m. EST.\n\nThe group also advertised its Wednesday night event of Anti-Don Jr. Sign-Making in anticipation of his Thursday evening appearance.\n\nDespite the protesters\u2019 accusations of a lack of diversity in ACCENT speakers, ACCENT has extended invitations to 33 speakers over the last four years. Of those, \u201csix have been women and 11 have been people of color,\u201d Gainesville reported.", "description": "Students at UF are planning to protest Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle's appearance at the school on Thursday.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Donald-Trump-Jr.-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
