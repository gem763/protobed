These days, it\u2019s just become easier to see. YouTube readily delivers embarrassing evidence of high-profile flip-flops: videos of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) arguing for impeachment in the \u201990s have been a staple of Democratic Twitter accounts for weeks.\n\nYet the political stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for McConnell, the majority leader, and Schumer, the minority leader, if the Senate is forced to sit in judgment of Trump. He would be the first president to seek reelection after being impeached by the House, if the Senate does not remove him from office. And control of the Senate is up for grabs.\n\nSo, the scrutiny over every one of the Senate leaders\u2019 moves will be intense. The urge to compare and contrast what they said about Clinton and what they say about Trump will be irresistible. And both men will hammer the other with whatever they can dig out from the past.\n\n\u201cBeing served soup from 20 years ago, it never tastes the same,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who wanted to dismiss the impeachment trial of Clinton 20 years ago but now prefers deliberation on Trump. \u201cWe all look back, it\u2019s a different time and a different place.\u201d\n\nSome things are the same.\n\nThe president\u2019s party, then as now, is livid. The process is terrible and unfair, lawmakers complain, and what the president did was bad, but not impeachable.\n\nThe opposition sees things differently: Let\u2019s get all the facts \u2014 the allegations are breathtaking.\n\nToday, Schumer is urging impartiality as the House impeachment inquiry ramps up. The New York Democrat said Thursday that he\u2019s not \u201cprejudging\u201d the case against Trump.\n\n\u201cWe may be like a jury,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor. \u201cBut we want the facts to come out. Not some, but all. That is our responsibility \u2014 to get the facts out \u2014 all of us.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, though, Schumer sounded like McConnell does now in bashing the House process and aligning with the president. Running for the Senate as a House member who opposed Clinton\u2019s impeachment, Schumer actually ended up voting against Clinton\u2019s removal from office three times, a record that may never be broken.\n\nSchumer voted against the Clinton impeachment articles in the House Judiciary Committee, on the House floor and then again as a brand-new senator in the February 1999 Senate trial.\n\nDuring his Senate campaign, the New York Democrat was repeatedly pressed on how he could be impartial as a Senate juror if he opposed impeachment in the House.\n\n\u201cA vote for Chuck Schumer is a vote not to impeach the president?\u201d NBC's Lisa Myers asked in late October 1998.\n\n\u201cBased on the present evidence, that is correct,\u201d Schumer replied on the \"Today\" show.\n\nSchumer spokesman Justin Goodman said the quote \u201ccame after the Starr investigation had concluded and been made public for more than a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe believed then and still believes now that all of the facts must come out and then a decision can be made \u2014 in stark contrast to Republicans who are trying to impede this important fact-finding mission from moving forward,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nToday, McConnell is running for reelection in a Trump-loving state, vowing to block the president\u2019s removal with his power as majority leader.\n\n\u201cThe way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader,\u201d he said in a web ad. He\u2019s also introduced a resolution with Graham ripping the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry.\n\nYet McConnell\u2019s decades-old statements could be used verbatim by Democrats today to justify their inquiry into allegations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine unless Ukrainian officials began an investigation into Joe Biden and his family.\n\n\u201cThe president has engaged in a persistent pattern and practice of obstruction of justice. The allegations are grave, the investigation is legitimate, and ascertaining the truth \u2014 the whole truth, and nothing but the unqualified, unevasive truth \u2014 is absolutely critical,\u201d McConnell said at the time. He also pledged to be an impartial juror.\n\nMcConnell was then chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and Clinton\u2019s impeachment dominated Senate races, including Schumer\u2019s race against Republican Al D\u2019Amato, who was sitting on the fence on impeachment. Senate Republicans hoped for big gains in November 1998, dreaming of a filibuster-proof majority.\n\nBut the public soured on the GOP\u2019s drive to oust Clinton amid Democratic attacks on independent counsel Kenneth Starr and the GOP\u2019s handling of the impeachment process. Senate Republicans didn\u2019t pick up any seats. McConnell shrugged off the setback, served another term as NRSC chairman and eventually became the top Senate Republican and the majority leader.\n\n\u201cThey are very different \u2014 very different cases and different people in different times. So I haven\u2019t drawn any lessons,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), who like Schumer was a House member elected to the Senate in 1998. Crapo voted for Clinton\u2019s impeachment in both the House and Senate.\n\nCrapo conceded it was a \u201cfair observation\u201d that Republicans are making the same argument today that Democrats did in 1998. But he also echoed the current GOP line, criticizing House Democrats for holding closed-door hearings to depose witnesses on the Ukraine scandal. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her lieutenants are expected to hold public hearings at some point but haven\u2019t decided when.\n\n\u201cWhat we see right now is basically just secrecy,\u201d Crapo said in an interview.\n\nDemocrats note Starr was gathering evidence on Clinton and the House was holding closed-door witness depositions before the impeachment inquiry was formally approved by the chamber. They also say comparisons between the two cases aren\u2019t legitimate.\n\n\u201cIf they were going to try to get Donald Trump on all his many, many, many extramarital affairs, I\u2019d say, \u2018Why are we spending time on that?\u2019\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). \u201cBut an extramarital affair versus withholding American military aid to get political advantage, that\u2019s something totally different.\u201d\n\nLeahy reminisced of persuading then-Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) to hold a closed-door, senators-only meeting in the Old Senate Chamber to hash out the process before the Clinton impeachment trial began, a rare moment of bipartisanship in a toxic political environment. Schumer and McConnell may have to do the same.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) was opposed to Clinton\u2019s impeachment and pushed for a censure resolution instead, a proposal floated by Democrats after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke to signal condemnation of Clinton without removing him. Feinstein said she is keeping an open mind in the Trump case.\n\n\u201cThe issues are so different,\u201d said Feinstein, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cCensure is usually used in terms of one [episode.] I think this is just beginning. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. I don\u2019t think we should rush to judgment.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the senator most in conflict with his past positions is Graham. He said not complying with subpoenas could be an impeachable offense 20 years ago; these days, it\u2019s difficult to tell what could change his mind about Trump.\n\nAfter he unveiled his resolution with McConnell criticizing the House over its procedures, Graham was asked how he would have responded to that in 1998.\n\n\"If we were doing this, you'd be beating the shit out of us,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd we would deserve it.\u201d\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b9/60/2386542a48aebfe1b19e2942f6bd/191026-schumer-mcconnell-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
