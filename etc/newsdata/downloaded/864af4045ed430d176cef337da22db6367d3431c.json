Yet the effort to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller led Giuliani to Ukraine, which now entangles the former federal prosecutor and mayor in legal jeopardy and is central to the danger threatening the presidency he labored to protect.\n\nThe New York Times reported Friday, citing a pair of anonymous sources familiar with the matter, that the investigation is linked to Giuliani\u2019s efforts to undermine Marie Yovanovitch, formerly the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has declined to comment on the Times report.\n\nTwo Florida businessmen with ties to Giuliani were charged Thursday with federal campaign finance violations. Both played key roles in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to launch a corruption investigation into Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a gas company there.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump deployed in Giuliani\u2019s defense the same two-word phrase \u2014 \u201cWitch Hunt!\u201d \u2014 he repeatedly used to attack the legitimacy of the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and now the House impeachment inquiry against him.\n\n\u201cSo now they are after the legendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani,\u201d Trump tweeted while on the way to his northern Virginia golf club. \u201cHe may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer.\u201d\n\nLater Saturday, he told Jeanine Pirro during a telephone interview broadcast on her Fox News Channel program that Giuliani continues as his lawyer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great gentleman. He was a great mayor, one of the greatest, maybe the greatest mayor in the history of New York,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was a fantastic prosecutor. I know nothing about him being under investigation ... I can\u2019t imagine it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man that looks for corruption and whatever he does I really believe he\u2019s a totally, I mean, I know he\u2019s an honorable man,\u201d Trump added.\n\nA whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine led Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to open an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nThree House committees taking depositions in the impeachment probe heard Friday from Yovanovitch.\n\nThe former ambassador has said she was fired from her post in May after insisting that Giuliani\u2019s requests to Ukrainian officials for investigations be relayed through official channels, according to a former diplomat who has spoken with her. The former diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation.\n\nTrump seemed to try to create space between himself and Giuliani on Friday when reporters asked if Giuliani was still representing him.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy,\u201d Trump said as he left the White House for a trip to Louisiana, adding that the two spoke briefly on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good attorney, and he has been my attorney. Yeah, sure.\u201d\n\nAsked if he still represented Trump, Giuliani replied to The Associated Press with a one-word text message: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials have been flabbergasted by Giuliani\u2019s performance on Trump\u2019s behalf, particularly his habit of revealing embarrassing information without so much as a heads-up to the president\u2019s full-time aides.\n\nAides have come to view Giuliani\u2019s behavior much as they have their boss\u2019 \u2014 with resignation that they will rarely be consulted beforehand to develop a strategic plan, and that any plan will be ignored.\n\nOne White House aide said there was frustration among aides that they have borne the brunt of criticism from some in Trump\u2019s orbit for not having a more coordinated response to the impeachment probe, saying they were operating without visibility into what Giuliani has been doing. The aide and others who spoke on this subject did so on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhite House lawyers rarely deal with Giuliani directly, preferring to coordinate when necessary with Jay Sekulow, viewed as the more even-keeled lawyer on the president\u2019s outside team.\n\nAides who spoke on this subject said the general feeling among them is that Trump has yet to fully grasp the extent of Giuliani\u2019s side-dealings and hope Trump will eventually sour on his fellow New Yorker.\n\nGiuliani was first brought on as the public face of Trump\u2019s defense of the Russia investigation, with Trump valuing his pugnacious style from the 2016 campaign and his reputation as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor.\u201d\n\nGiuliani wanted to be secretary of state, but ended up withdrawing from consideration for a Cabinet post.\n\nBut Giuliani successfully pressed Trump\u2019s case on cable TV, even though some of the scattershot interviews seemed to do more harm than good. Even then, Giuliani at times let slip seemingly damaging information as a way to get ahead of a story, to normalize something while also lacing into the special counsel\u2019s credibility and undermining his investigation.\n\nHe also was part of a key decision to block Trump from conducting an in-person interview with Mueller.\n\nMany in the administration \u2014 including in the West Wing and at the State Department \u2014 have tried to distance themselves from Giuliani\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, eagerly leaking to reporters unflattering stories about the former mayor\u2019s clumsy investigative efforts.\n\nAnd while there is a grudging respect among some Trump allies and in the reelection campaign at Giuliani\u2019s willingness to defend the president on TV, something few others in the White House have done of late, many believe his interviews have become too hyperbolic and his undisciplined manner of speaking could put Trump at risk.\n\nBut though Trump himself has at time grown frustrated with Giuliani, he has defended the former mayor to people around him. Trump has spoken admiringly of Giuliani\u2019s no-nonsense style and willingness to go all-out to defend the administration and attack the president\u2019s Democratic foes and the news media, according to three White House officials and Republicans close to the White House. The officials insisted on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Giuliani withdrew his name from consideration for a Cabinet post and was not passed over by Trump.", "description": "Aides for the president said Trump has yet to fully grasp the extent of Giuliani\u2019s side-dealings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da27e45200000da065005fc.jpeg?cache=wiziwvunir&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
