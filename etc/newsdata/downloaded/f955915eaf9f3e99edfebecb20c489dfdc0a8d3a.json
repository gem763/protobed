Naval platforms adapt and evolve as a capability over time.\n\n\"And they are part of sophisticated systems \u2013 focusing only on the platform is a mistake.\"\n\nThe Turnbull government committed $90 billion to build 12 submarines, nine frigates and 12 patrol boats locally as part of the 2016 Defence White Paper.\n\nThe government is also locked into spending up to $20 billion on hundreds of new armoured vehicles for the army, while the air force has begun taking delivery of 72 Joint Strike Fighters, which will cost $17 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut analysts have warned too much taxpayers' money has been committed to manned mega-platforms while innovative research in unmanned and autonomous systems receives less than half a per cent of Defence's annual $37 billion budget.\n\nDefence think tank the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has urged some of the funding from the $50 billion submarine project be quarantined to acquire drones for the future boats.\n\nDefence Department officials last month admitted the budget did not include money for unmanned systems and it would have to be found elsewhere. Also, the size of drones would be unable to be bigger than a torpedo.\n\nThe threat from drone technology was highlighted last week during China's military parade, when it showcased two undersea robots, although their capabilities are unclear.\n\nBut Senator Reynolds will say naval platforms will need to remain large, complex and crewed out of necessity, whether it be for responding to natural disasters, protecting other shipping with high-tech warships fitted with air warfare capabilities and keeping sea lanes open through stealthy submarines.\n\n\"The importance of having the ability to exercise sea control \u2013 using air, surface and subsurface assets in unison \u2013 will not disappear,\" she will say.\n\n\"Nations still need the ability to exert their national power through the force of arms if required, and large naval platforms will remain part of that equation.\n\n\"The challenge for navy, for Defence and for the nation is how to remain flexible enough in defence acquisition to augment major platforms using new and emerging technologies to secure both our offensive and defensive advantage.\"\n\nSenator Reynolds will say maintaining the information advantage in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance technology was just as crucial as having a superior platform.\n\nShe also anticipates emerging threats that warships and submarines will need to be protected against include cyber attacks, hypersonic weapons that give just minutes warning of an attack, and railguns which use electromagnetic forces to fire projectiles at much greater speed and ranges.", "description": "Defence Minister Linda Reynolds has rejected criticism the Morrison government is wrong to spend $90 billion on warships and submarines at the expense of cheaper drones.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1886%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_32/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ef0f1815fb25c4d8ec0ef5b3835c04f6eb9e4a40", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
