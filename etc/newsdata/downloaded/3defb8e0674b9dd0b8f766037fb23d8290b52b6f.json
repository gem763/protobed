No,\u2019 said a source.\n\nIn a message shared with colleagues, another wrote: \u2018What a shocker. It\u2019s unbelievable in this day and age. How patronising.\u2019\n\nA further member of staff said it was a disgrace for Mr Lygo to \u2018belittle\u2019 the long-serving pair.\n\nThe row comes at the same time as the network is at the centre of a racism storm.\n\nLast week, The Mail on Sunday revealed how just one non-white presenter was used on screen during 18 hours of programming earlier this month.\n\nDaytime commissioning editors Jane Beacon (left) and Clare Ely (right) who share more than 40 years of service between them\n\nMs Beacon and Ms Ely share between them more than 40 years of service to ITV, including overseeing ratings hits such as This Morning and Lorraine.\n\nBoth women have young children and shared the role of commissioning editor \u2013 each working three days a week \u2013 to allow them to spend time with their families.\n\nIn his email to staff, Mr Lygo, 62, wrote: \u2018Alas, the time has come to say goodbye to Clare Ely and Jane Beacon. Clare and Jane have been doing a sterling job running Daytime Commissioning over the last few years, but have decided that after so many thousands of hours of daytime TV it\u2019s time for something new. So, deaf to my protestations, they will be heading off to sit on their own respective pink sofas. Whatever they do next I\u2019m sure it will be a huge success. They have been brilliant and I will miss them both very much.\u2019\n\nITV hit daytime show Loose Women starring (left to right) Andrea McLean , Saira Khan, Stacey Solomon and Kay Adams\n\nLast night, a female ITV employee told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018If Kevin thought he was making a joke about their daytime shows having pink sofas, it didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u2018This Morning has a blue sofa and Lorraine a grey one. There are no pink sofas at ITV, so that has to be a reference to their gender \u2013 the girlie-pink thing. These are two highly regarded and long-serving employees. It is a disgrace to belittle them like this.\u2019\n\nThe sexism controversy caps a disastrous week for ITV during which it was also criticised by MPs over unedited footage from the now-defunct Jeremy Kyle Show, which showed vulnerable guests being \u2018bullied and humiliated\u2019. Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, has written to ITV\u2019s managing director Julian Bellamy to demand an explanation for what MPs described as \u2018highly unethical\u2019 and \u2018demeaning and insulting\u2019 behaviour on the programme.\n\nThe show \u2013 which ITV has insisted took \u2018its responsibilities around duty of care to participants very seriously\u2019 \u2013 was axed in May following the death of Steve Dymond, 63. His appearance had been filmed but not aired.\n\nThe racism controversy was sparked when The Mail on Sunday revealed last week that there was just one non-white presenter on screen during 18 hours of programming on Tuesday, October 8.\n\nMail on Sunday story last week which revealed how just one non-white presenter was used on screen during 18 hours of programming earlier this month\n\nThat was newsreader Nina Hossain, whose father is from Bangladesh. She presented the ITV lunchtime news for 24 minutes.\n\nIn the wake of our story, it is understood that Mr Lygo \u2013 who worked at the BBC and Channel 4 before joining ITV in 2010 \u2013 called several of the network\u2019s ethnic minority stars, including Good Morning Britain\u2019s Andi Peters, to reassure them that improving diversity was a priority.\n\nThere was an increase in the number of non-white stars on the channel last week.\n\nThe daily chat show Loose Women featured non-white panellists every day apart from Thursday. They included former Apprentice runner-up Saira Khan on Monday and Friday, and singer Brenda Edwards on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nITV did not respond to requests for comment last night.", "description": "Director of TV Kevin Lygo announced the departures of daytime commissioning editors Jane Beacon and Clare Ely, suggesting the women were leaving to 'sit on their respective pink sofas'.", "authors": ["Katie Hind Showbusiness Editor For The Mail In Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19936314-0-image-a-58_1571519086169.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
