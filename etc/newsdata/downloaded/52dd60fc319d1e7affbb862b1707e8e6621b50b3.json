They\u2019re the frontrunners, after all. There is still a low hum of interest in candidates like Pete Buttigieg (the South Bend mayor responsible for more than one person in Brooklyn walking round in a T-shirt saying \u201cBOOT-EDGE-EDGE\u201d); Beto O\u2019Rourke (who was \u201cborn to be in it\u201d, then sorry that he said he was born to be in it); Amy Klobuchar (who famously ate a salad with a comb); Cory Booker (a real-life vegan and animal welfare activist, which upsets some people); and Julian Castro (whose solid debate performances and principled emphasis on immigration have kept him afloat in the polls.) But then there\u2019s Andrew Yang. Who the hell even is Andrew Yang?\n\nJust kidding \u2014 I know you know who Andrew Yang is. He\u2019s the one with the #YangGang and almost 800,000 Twitter followers. He\u2019s the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who wants to give out free money to anyone who\u2019ll listen. He\u2019s the candidate who tweeted earlier today: \u201cFor those wondering I will be crowdsurfing in sandals at Thursday\u2019s debate\u201d (prompting 12,390 engagements.)\n\nAndrew Yang wants people to go \u201cnot left. Not right. Forward\u201d. He believes in that campaign slogan so much that you can buy it on a T-shirt at the Yang 2020 online store. You can also buy one that says: \u201cMath. Money. Marijuana\u201d, as well as a water bottle that professes its support for a \u201ctrickle-up economy\u201d. His website is adorned with photos of people at rallies holding up signs that simply say \u201cMATH\u201d. And his central policy is a universal basic income \u2014 or Freedom Dividend \u2014 for every American over the age of 18, \u201cno strings attached, paid for by a new tax on the companies benefiting most from automation\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nYang is a startup entrepreneur, which leaves him open to accusations that he\u2019s drunk the San Francisco Kool-Aid and decided he can raid the coffers for all that money without regard for the consequences. He has reassuring credentials, though, including a degree in economics and legal training at Columbia. He believes in the Freedom Dividend so much that he\u2019s already paying three families an annual UBI out of his own pocket as a micro-experiment. He has a chatbot on his website that will direct you towards his main policies (UBI, \u201chuman-centered capitalism\u201d, and Medicare-for-All.)\n\nAnd here\u2019s a strange thing about Andrew Yang: People who used to vote for Bernie Sanders love him. The alt-right love him. People who have never been interested in politics love him. My British fianc\u00e9 is convinced he\u2019s going to be the presidential candidate. I put out a call on Twitter for anyone who was backing Andrew Yang to get in touch, and within minutes, my inbox was flooded with DMs. There were so many, I was up all hours of the night trying to reply to them. As a test, I tried the same with Bernie Sanders supporters and Elizabeth Warren supporters over the next couple of days; no \u201cBernie Bros\u201d got in touch, and just three Warren backers did. Even as I was trying to read those, my inbox was filling again with the thoughts of more members of the YangGang.\n\nWho are they? Well, they come from across the political spectrum. A few described themselves as \u201csocially liberal but fiscally conservative\u201d. Others told me they were \u201c100% progressive\u201d. Some could quote sections of Yang\u2019s book off by heart. A large number of them told me they\u2019d been previously disengaged, but were introduced to Yang\u2019s politics via The Joe Rogan Experience, a phenomenally popular podcast which aims to speak to your everyday \u201cAmerican bro\u201d and introduces its audience to \u201cthinkers\u201d in sometimes hours-long discussions with people as disparate as Elon Musk, Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, Jordan Peterson, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Russell Brand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Performance Theatre major, with a minor in English (concentration in Creative Writing),\u201d wrote someone who identified themselves as Jackson. \u201cAs an artist, I was immediately drawn to the idea of UBI when I first heard someone mention [Yang\u2019s] campaign about a year ago. Arts aren\u2019t wildly prosperous financially speaking, and I\u2019m often stressed and anxious about making a living in my career path. My best option is usually said to be find stable work in food service or some other industry to make a living and focus on arts as my side job. So when I hear food industry jobs are going to be automated, I realize that I have almost no feasible way to make a living while doing what I love. The Freedom Dividend would essentially allow me to pursue acting, or writing, or any medium of art, without the worry that not landing a gig won\u2019t mean I can\u2019t afford rent or my next meal. It would allow artists to pursue their craft full time, and revitalize local performance and visual art. It would essentially guarantee that I get a prosperous future, and that is a campaign I am willing to give my full support for.\u201d\n\nSo far, so progressive. Elsewhere, a tweeter called Nihaar Sinha told me he was a \u201cfirst-generation American son of immigrants with progressive views\u201d but also a \u201cformer investment banker and business owner who believes strongly in (well-regulated) capitalism\u201d. He doesn\u2019t agree with all of Andrew Yang\u2019s plans, he said, but he does feel Yang is the only one \u201coffering 21st century solutions for 21st century problems\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Freedom Dividend, for example, does not neatly fit out current political framework,\u201d he continued. \u201cI can call it progressive (strong safety net) or libertarian (no administrative bloat, money in hands of people instead of the government), socialist (redistribution of wealth) or capitalist (dividend to shareholders of our democracy, paid for my companies who've used public goods like broadband subsidies or public university research to grow). That's because it's not an ideological solution. It's a data-driven solution tailored to the unique 21st century problem of automation displacing millions of Americans, and supporting empirical research showing cash transfer is the most effective form of assistance.\n\n\u201cEspecially given how divided we are, I've seen Andrew win over everyone from The Breakfast Club to Tucker Carlson to Joe Rogan to Morning Joe to The Root to Ben Shapiro. He actually can deliver on \u201chealing the divide\u201d to which everyone pays lip service but most candidates ignore.\u201d\n\nOthers spoke just as passionately about Yang healing a political divide with his refusal to condemn right or left-wing politics.\n\nThen there were the slightly more kooky responses. One Twitter account whose name is Andrew Yang Is The Singularity (with the strange handle @Yang41344660) DM\u2019d me to tell me that Yang \u201cleads me to envision a future where more people get along, are happy, are optimistic, are more caring, more outwardly and community focused. A complete shift in what we immediately value. I've felt a change happen within myself, and I know other Yang supporters would agree.\u201d The writer continued: \u201cIt is this possibility of this drastic shift or leap towards peace and sanity that has me absolutely glued to this campaign.\u201d\n\nLike with Marianne Williamson, many have openly wondered whether the increasingly vocal support behind Andrew Yang is due to (in the words of one of my fellow political writers during a conversation about the YangGang) \u201cTrump folks trying to make trouble\u201d. They wonder about bots, or about entryists trying to make Democrats look ridiculous so Trump doesn\u2019t lose the presidency in 2020.\n\nEven weirder, some Redditors who habituate 4chan have said that Yang has an alt-right following because they believe his Freedom Dividend would destroy the US economy in the same the German economy suffered after the First World War and usher in \u201cWeimar solutions\u201d (it\u2019s a stretch, I know, but I\u2019m not the one who came up with the theory.) Another popular post on Reddit describes someone who had fallen into the depths of far-right ideology and was reintroduced to hope and optimism by the Yang campaign. While cautioning that he\u2019s still \u201cde-programming myself from the hate that I absorbed over the last five years\u201d, the writer says that Yang\u2019s \u201cperception that AI is currently the largest 'unseen' threat to the average American worker \u2014 me \u2014 couldn't have rung more strongly with me. His solutions just made sense to me in a way that I can't articulate. I tried to poke holes in the argument for a basic income, but could only come up short. For me, a thousand a month would let me spend more time with my sick mother, without working increasingly later shifts at work. It would give me the flexibility to care for my loved ones without sapping my own strength. I don't know why, but seeing the benefit to myself in such a dramatic manner just triggered some otherworldly type of empathy within me.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

And whether or not people are \u201cmaking trouble\u201d round his candidacy, it\u2019s clear Yang has touched a nerve with a lot of people who aren\u2019t used to having nerves touched. How long do you need to make trouble before real people start listening, anyway? And how much does it matter if someone with new and interesting ideas gets a platform because half the people engaging with him think he sounds nuts? How much does it matter if people fall for your politics because of how you make them feel, as opposed to what you\u2019ll be able to do (it did, after all, work for Trump)?\n\nAndrew Yang is currently polling at 3 per cent, which is pretty healthy for this stage of the game \u2014 to put that into perspective, he\u2019s polling well above Amy Klobuchar and Julian Castro, and his numbers are the same as Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke. He has, additionally, promised a \u201cbig\u201d surprise at tomorrow\u2019s third Democratic debate, to do something \u201cunprecedented\u201d. He\u2019s popular enough now for that to generate some media intrigue (and I don\u2019t just mean from me.) Along with hundreds of thousands of members of the YangGang, I\u2019ll be looking out for it.", "description": "You\u2019ve probably heard already that the ones to watch in this week\u2019s Democratic debate are Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
