Forbes CEO Conference 2019\n\nSince retiring in September, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has revealed plans to travel the world next year, visiting schools in different countries.\n\nHe now wants to teach children skills for the digital age, like wisdom.\n\nHe defined wisdom as living \u201clike a human\u201d, caring about others, and caring about the future.\n\nMa said he had already built up \u201ca bit of\u201d a kindergarten, a primary school, and a middle school, and hinted at more ideas.\n\nAsk Jack Ma what he\u2019s been working on since retiring, and he will tell you about his plans to visit schools and teachers around the world next year.\n\nThe retired founder of Chinese giant Alibaba revealed during a dialogue session during the Forbes CEO Conference in Singapore on Tuesday (Oct 15) that he had already built up \u201ca bit of a kindergarten\u201d, \u201ca bit of a primary school\u201d, and a middle school as part of his retirement plans to return to teaching.\n\nHe added that he had been working with teachers in rural areas for the past five years, and had ideas he wanted to develop.\n\nRead also: Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma \u2014 the richest person in China \u2014 is retiring with a net worth of $38 billion. Here\u2019s his incredible rags-to-riches story.\n\nTo laughter from the audience, Ma \u2013 who failed his primary school, middle school and university entrance exams \u2013 joked that he would never be accepted into Alibaba today amid competition from Stanford and Harvard graduates.\n\nTurning serious, he expressed concerned that the younger generation would be ill-equipped to survive the the digital era if education systems did not change within the next 20 to 30 years.\n\nDescribing smart people as those who used their brains, Ma said he was \u201cso proud\u201d of Alibaba\u2019s intelligent employees, but thought it infinitely preferable to be a wise person who used their heart.\n\nRead also: Chinese tech billionaire Jack Ma says it\u2019s a \u2018blessing\u2019 for his staff to work gruelling 12-hour shifts, 6 days a week\n\n\u201cMost smart people want to win. We want to make smart people learn how to live like a human, how to care about others. When smart people learn how to care about others, how to care about the future, how to be human, then a company becomes warm, (things go) smooth, and (it has) soft power. Otherwise, you have a group of gangsters,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is why I believe we need more wise people and leaders,\u201d Ma continued. \u201cA smart machine will be always smarter than you are; a machine can never be wiser.\u201d\n\n\u201cMachines don\u2019t have hearts, machines only have chips. So, this is what I think: human beings should always learn to be wise.\u201d\n\nThe former English teacher suggested the education system be changed to teach children how to \u201cbe a human\u201d in the AI era.\n\nHe identified skills like music, dancing, painting and sports as \u201cvery important\u201d, as these artistic pursuits engaged people\u2019s hearts.\n\nRead also: A Silicon Valley-inspired, S$30,000 per year preschool is opening in Funan mall \u2013 and it\u2019s promising to teach toddlers 21st century skills like coding and \u2018grit\u2019\n\nOther key skills he said he considered essential were independent thinking, innovation, and creativity.\n\n\u201cWhen young people learn (about success) too much, they think they can easily succeed,\u201d Ma said. \u201cLearn the mistakes, not avoid them. When you meet the mistake, you know how to face it, how to solve it, how to challenge it. This is called wisdom. This is what we should teach our kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to do more things about that,\u201d he said, to applause from the audience. \u201cIt is important. There are a lot of problems, but (there are) solutions. We have to do it.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire added that his focus was on young people.\n\n\u201cTrust the young people. I trust young people more than I trust senior people, successful people \u2013 because there\u2019s no expert of the future, there are only experts of yesterday,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWorking with most of the successful people \u2013 they only talk about yesterday. We are entering into a century, into a world, that is so new. Working with young people, you\u2019re talking about the future.\u201d\n\nRead also: 27 of the most brilliant quotes from Jack Ma, the cofounder of Alibaba and one of the richest people in the world", "description": "Business Insider - He suggested the education system be changed to teach children how to \"be a human\" in the AI era..
