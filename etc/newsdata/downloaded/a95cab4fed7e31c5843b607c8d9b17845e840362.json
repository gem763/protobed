From Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s advice on vaginal steaming to detoxing masks for your vulva, there is truly no end to the nonsense women are peddled.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to scorn the people who go in for such treatments. But it is little wonder we\u2019re confused about how best to look after our bits, given the conflicting information we receive.\n\nIn 2016, a research paper by the University of California found a correlation between pubic hair removal and increased rates of STIs. This week, a new study by Ohio State University suggests that women who wax or shave off all their pubic hair are not, after all, at greater risk of contracting STIs.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe link between depilation and disease seemed to confirm what many had long suspected: that women who want sex and who wish to make themselves appealing to sexual partners are gullible and irresponsible. So it\u2019s heartening to see that myth debunked. But this conversation is still rooted in a single truth: women cannot make choices about their own bodies without facing social repercussions.\n\nIn a 2017 survey, 30 per cent of men admitted that pubic hair would be a relationship deal-breaker. The same study found just 6 per cent of women left their pubic hair completely natural. Patriarchal beauty standards demand you make your body more feminine by removing hair, then blames you for getting infections.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 14 women using social media to change the world 1/14 Marley Dias @iammarleydias At just 11 years old, Marley Dias gained international attention in 2016 after becoming frustrated with the lack of diversity in her school curriculum. What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011. Over the years, the Mancunian has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. Witton is inspirationally confident and isn\u2019t afraid of talking about her sex life to her thousands of subscribers in videos such as 'How Many People Have I Slept With?' and 'The Benefits of Porn'. The vlogger is also a champion for body positivity (her most viewed video with over 8 million views is about the struggles of large boobs) and invisible illnesses \u2013 as she herself suffers from ulcerative colitis and proudly wears a stoma. Getty 8/14 Adwoa Aboah @adwoaaboah British model Adwoa Aboah is no stranger to the crippling effect of depression having suffered from it herself. This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV. The north London native champions the rights of women and immigrants on social media, with a Twitter account that is rife with political commentary with a humorous edge. Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers. AFP 12/14 Rowan Blanchard @rowanblanchard When Rowan Blanchard isn\u2019t taking over the world of acting, she\u2019s taking to Twitter and Instagram to talk to her 5.1 million followers about various activist pursuits. The 17-year-old uses her platform to discuss social and economic issues, with topics as diverse as human rights and gun control, and isn\u2019t afraid to give a voice to those who haven\u2019t been heard. Blanchard was very vocal in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas shootings earlier this year, talking with activists and highlighting their plight on social media. Getty 13/14 Liv Little @livlittle As the founder of Gal-dem, a magazine produced by women of colour, Liv Little has gained international recognition for her work in diversifying print media.

Either that, they said, or people who regularly engaged in what they called \u201cextreme grooming\u201d of their pubic area were more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour.\n\nOr it could be that people wax and shave more regularly when they are having more regular sex. This simply makes them statistically more likely to come into contact with STIs, and has absolutely nothing to do with the topiary of their nether regions.\n\nThe very fact that removing all your pubic hair is referred to as \u2018extreme grooming\u2019 by researchers suggests a degree of judgement. Ripping out some of your pubic hair with hot wax is fine, but don\u2019t go overboard\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there are no downsides to hair removal. Research shows that 60 per cent of women have experienced health complications such as abrasion and irritation as a result of waxing. But while I am happy to take full responsibility for my ingrown hairs, I will not accept liability for matters of public health.\n\nSTI rates are rising alarmingly in the UK. When funding for sexual health services is being cut and in some places clinics are being forced to close altogether, it\u2019s convenient to point to personal grooming habits as the culprit.\n\nUsing condoms and ensuring you\u2019ve had the HPV vaccine, if you\u2019re eligible for it, are far better ways to protect yourself from STIs than worrying about whether or not to wax. Furthermore, an STI cannot be contracted out of thin air, it must be caught from someone. Putting the focus on regular testing and equipping people with the information and confidence to discuss sexual health with their partners would be far more useful than shaming women for wanting to look sexy.\n\nThe very fact that removing all your pubic hair is referred to as \u201cextreme grooming\u201d by researchers suggests a degree of judgement. Ripping out some of your pubic hair with hot wax is fine, but don\u2019t go overboard. You don\u2019t want to be \u201cextreme\u201d. Let\u2019s keep it tasteful shall we, ladies?\n\nThese mixed messages about how our bodies should look and behave are not just damaging to our self-esteem, they get in the way of us accessing accurate information and sexual health and pleasure.\n\nWhen the creators of sexual wellness app Ferly were researching their target market, this was one of their biggest findings. \u201cWe found women lacked accurate information to make healthy and pleasurable decisions,\u201d co-founder Billie Quinlan told me recently. \u201cOn top of that, they felt shame and stigma around their sexuality which prevented them from really exploring their desires and asking for what they needed, and this was impacting their mental and emotional wellbeing.\u201d\n\nHappily this latest study will go some way to setting the record straight on STIs. Unpicking the stigma around female sexuality will take longer.
