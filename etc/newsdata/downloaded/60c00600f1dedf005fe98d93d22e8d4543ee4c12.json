Howley\u2019s departure from the Rugby World Cup has rocked the tournament in Japan and left Wales somehow attempting to move on from what has been a monumental distraction.\n\nWarren Gatland\u2019s side trained twice on Wednesday \u2013 once in the afternoon and again in the evening under floodlights to prepare for Monday\u2019s first game with Georgia \u2013 before travelling to Toyota via train. The evening session in Kitakyushu saw Gatland\u2019s men take out some of their frustration ahead of what will be a physical meeting in their World Cup opener. It is understood it was Wales\u2019 best session since arriving in Japan last Wednesday.\n\nWarren Gatland must plough on regardless amid Wales turmoil | Paul Rees Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to get on with it really\u201d said forwards coach Robin McBryde. \u201cGeorgia are our opponents, it\u2019s our opening game of the World Cup, and that has taken precedent over anything else. There is a duty we need to fulfil. The preparations have gone well up to date. There was a little bit of a feeling of circling the wagons and not allowing anything to influence the environment. It\u2019s important we start with a bang.\u201d\n\nMcBryde played with Howley \u2013 who is alleged to have breached World Rugby\u2019s regulation six which covers betting and anti-corruption \u2013 with Wales.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough. We\u2019ve been together for a quite a bit of time. It\u2019s unfortunate he [Howley] has to go through this. He\u2019s been a great servant both as a player and a coach,\u201d McBryde said. \u201cThis was our swansong as a coaching group so it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019ve got to go through this. He\u2019s a good man and a good friend. It\u2019s sad to see someone have to go through it. He was keen to explain the news to the other coaches, rather than us finding out second hand. He did that.\u201d\n\nWales were met in Toyota on Thursday by Stephen Jones who has been flown in to replace Howley as attack coach in emergency fashion. Somehow head coach Gatland must prepare his team for a game and the players are determined to have a backs-to-the-wall approach which may yet prove invaluable.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nGatland will name a strong side for Georgia, but rookie flanker Aaron Wainwright is set to start. McBryde believes the Dragons tyro \u2013 who is just 21 and only made his Test debut in Argentina in June 2018 \u2013 can have a better career than former Wales and British & Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton. Wainwright plays in the back-row like Warburton and Gatland is a big fan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a player with that growth still there. He\u2019s still learning the game,\u201d McBryde said of Wainwright. \u201cHe\u2019s in fantastic condition. He\u2019s put some good weight on and he\u2019s able to maintain that weight with all the running we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cHis skill work is still on the up and it\u2019s the same for his set-piece work as well, but he\u2019s going to be around for a number of years. The potential he has got is to grow. I don\u2019t like to compare people to other players, but he is very reminiscent of a young Sam Warburton with the way he carries the ball. Both in attack and defence, he\u2019s very physical. He enjoys that part of the game. He could even be better than Sam, though.\u201d", "description": "Wales players went hell for leather in training in a bid to put the investigation into Rob Howley\u2019s suspected breach of betting regulations behind them", "authors": ["Alex Bywater"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b029b9fa98de5554475f843d51fd883a93c42f8/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa1afb6a201152e0f77ea54cb162d142", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
