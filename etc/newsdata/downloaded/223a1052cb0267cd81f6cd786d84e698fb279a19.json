The transaction cost $600 in fees. The bigger question is, however, would you trust Bitcoin\u2019s network to transfer over $1 billion with a single mouse click?\n\n$1 Billion in BTC Transferred In a Single Transaction\n\nSomeone has transferred 94,504 BTC from multiple addresses to a single one today, September 6th. The recipient wallet is an unknown one and it appears to have been created today, specifically for this transaction.\n\nThe dollar value of the BTC sent is upwards of $1 billion which, needless to say, is a substantial amount of money. The cost of the transaction was $600 worth of fees and it received 31 confirmations.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s network has seen a serious increase in its hash rate, which is a sign that it\u2019s getting stronger and more secure, sending $1 billion in BTC definitely requires courage. There\u2019s no central institution guaranteeing the transfer and if something goes wrong, there\u2019s no one that could do anything about the amount.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s worth noting that yesterday Bitcoin\u2019s network marked yet another all-time high in terms of its hash rate which surpassed 88 quintillions TH/s.\n\nAnd while the network might provide zero insurance of the funds being transferred, it\u2019s also important to note that there\u2019s no banking institution that would transfer that amount for as little as $600. Moreover, the transaction was peer-to-peer and it was executed in a matter of minutes, which would also be impossible if using a regular bank.\n\nThe Reason Behind The Transfer?\n\nPresently, it\u2019s impossible to identify the reason behind the transfer. However, there are plenty of speculations surrounding it.\n\nSome people tend to believe that the amount was moved in preparation for storing it on Bakkt\u2019s warehouse. The Bitcoin futures contract trading platform is scheduled to launch on September 23rd but its warehousing solution will begin accepting cryptocurrency today.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a wild guess and perhaps speculation. The wallet doesn\u2019t seem to belong to any exchange.\n\nApart from that large transaction that transferred 94,504 BTC, there are also a few smaller ones and the current received balance of the address stands at 94,505 BTC.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "The popular bot which tracks the movement of large amounts of cryptocurrency, Whale Alert, has pinged today that someone transferred upwards of 94,000", "authors": ["George Georgiev", "View All Posts George Georgiev", "About The Author", "Georgi Georgiev Is A Seasoned Writer With Over Two Years Of Experience Writing About Blockchain", "Cryptocurrencies.
