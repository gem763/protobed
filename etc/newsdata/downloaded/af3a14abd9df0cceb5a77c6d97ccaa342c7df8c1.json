He was acquitted in a second trial last year.\n\nMr Winchester's murder remains unsolved.\n\nHis killing rocked the legal and political establishment and sparked one of the nation's largest-ever criminal investigations.\n\nMr Eastman, 74, had earlier rejected A$3.8m compensation offer from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government.\n\nIn earlier hearings, the ACT Supreme Court heard that Mr Eastman had lost the opportunity to have a family and a career because of his imprisonment. His mother and two younger siblings had also died during that time.\n\n\"He has lost a significant chunk of his life,\" his lawyer, Sam Tierney, said outside the ACT Supreme Court on Monday.\n\nLong battle for freedom\n\nMr Winchester was shot twice in the head outside his family home in Canberra, the nation's capital. He remains the most senior police officer to have been murdered in Australia.\n\nMr Eastman, then a public servant, was identified early on as a suspect because he had allegedly sent threats to police over the handling of an earlier criminal matter.\n\nAfter being imprisoned, Mr Eastman spent 19 years fighting his conviction - launching appeals in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2008, all of which failed.\n\nBut he successfully argued to be released in 2014 after a judicial inquiry ruled that he had suffered a \"substantial miscarriage of justice\" due to flaws in police evidence that was used at his trial.\n\nA second trial held last year, involving more than 100 witnesses, led to Mr Eastman being acquitted.\n\nHe launched his compensation claim shortly afterwards.", "description": "David Eastman was acquitted last year of killing one of Australia\u2019s most senior police officers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0F48/production/_109221930_gettyimages-1153996420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
