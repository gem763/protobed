Friends and family of the victim, however, described her as a fifth-grade student at Deerfield Elementary School.\n\nAlex Ortiz\u2014whose daughter attended school with the victim\u2014 told NJ.com that the elementary school would be offering grief counseling on Monday to those affected.\n\n\u201cYou come thinking the kids will be safe, not a freak accident,\u201d said Ortiz, a Deerfield Township resident who attends the festival with her four kids each year.\n\nAmusement rides and games were closed on Sunday, but the Deerfield Township Harvest Festival, run by the Deerfield Township Recreation Committee, stayed open for all other events.\n\nThe company that owns the amusement park rides, Skelly\u2019s Amusements, received permission from the state to reopen on Sunday, but stated in a Facebook post that it was \u201cheartbroken,\u201d adding that it was cooperating with the state police investigation into the incident.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely heartbroken. Words cannot express our feelings and we extend our deepest sympathies to the individual\u2019s family and loved ones. We ask that you keep them in your thoughts,\u201d the statement continued.", "description": "An annual New Jersey fall festival ended on a somber note Saturday night after a 10-year-old girl was ejected from a carnival ride and died.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-989556568-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
