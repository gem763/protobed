Photo: YouTube\n\nI keep hearing people invoke the Moulin Rouge soundtrack cover of \u201cLady Marmalade\u201d \u2014 starring Lil\u2019 Kim, M\u00fda, Pink, and Christina Aguilera \u2014 in speaking about the new Ariana Grande, Lana Del Rey, and Miley Cyrus Charlie\u2019s Angels soundtrack single \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel,\u201d and I sorta get it, but I also don\u2019t. It\u2019s a successor to the 2001 hit in the sense that, yes, multiple famous women are singing together on the same beat. That\u2019s the beginning and the end of it. \u201cMarmalade\u201d braided voices together that had been circling the same hip-hop and R&B/pop scene. \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d is something else, something that could maybe only happen in an era where everyone exists in their own tailor-made internet with their own little network of music-app playlists and Netflix and Hulu recommendations. \u201cAngel\u201d blends styles that sound fine alone but struggle to jell together, such is the vastness of the space between the singers present.\n\nThat\u2019s cool, though. Ari\u2019s in her zone skating around the elaborate network of interlocking notes designed by frequent collaborators Max Martin and Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Miley\u2019s Music City\u2013by\u2013way\u2013of\u2013the\u2013club drawl and timbre are adaptable enough to keep her from breaking anything here. \u201cAngels\u201d strains to figure out what to do with Lana, such as she exists now, as a singer who does her best work at half the speed of her peers in the biz, whose last album was closer in spirit to glacial \u201990s northwestern indie rock than anything on the radio in this decade. The beat here slows its tempo to accommodate Lana, which is fine because it ran a little fast in the first place. In the end, \u201cAngels\u201d is less of a meeting of like minds and more of a ride from the pulsing center of a city past the limits and into the laconic stretches outside.\n\nMaybe pop\u2019s done consolidating. Maybe the logical end of the algorithmification of mainstream music is that in the next decade, artists will get to occupy their own individual principalities of sound and trust that our tastes are limber enough to traverse between them, instead of always meeting us in the middle. Or maybe they won\u2019t! Time will tell. I\u2019m thankful for \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel,\u201d at the end of the day, because I\u2019ll take every opportunity to watch Lana Del Rey wield weapons. Thanks to director Hannah Lux Davis and everyone involved for a GIF gold mine full of throwing knives and nunchaku.", "description": "\u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Angel\u201d could maybe only happen in an era where everyone exists in their own tailor-made internet with their own little network of music app playlists and Netflix and Hulu recommendations.", "authors": ["Craig Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-dont-call-me-angel.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
