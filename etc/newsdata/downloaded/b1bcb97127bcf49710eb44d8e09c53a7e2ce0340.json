We did, however, give away 21 points, which we are not happy about.\n\n\u201cThat said, I was particularly impressed with the way the team fought and got better as the match progressed, so it was a good step-up from our last match.\n\n\u201cWe learned some good lessons as a team in the last three Tests, and that will bode well for us in the future.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the young talent coming through the ranks, Raubenheimer said: \u201cOur main goal with the Test matches we played this year was to try to build a group of players that we could work with going forward to the 2021 Rugby World Cup.\n\n\u201cSix players who played against Scotland today were Under-20 players, and some of them did well, while others now have a good idea of the demands of Test rugby, which is all part of the learning process.\u201d\n\nScotland No 8 Jade Konkel scored the first points of the match in the 10th minute after some good forward play close to the line, and Sarah Law (flyhalf) kicked the conversion to hand them a 7-0 lead.\n\nThe Springbok Women hit back with some good phases on attack and they managed to work their way close to the tryline minutes later, but a knock-on denied them from capitalising on the opportunity.\n\nScotland, in turn, crossed the tryline for the second time early in the second quarter thanks to Lisa Thomson (centre), and Konkel followed this up with her second try from more determined play close to the tryline to stretch their lead to 19-0.\n\nThe Springbok Women fought until the halftime hooter, and worked their way close to the tryline once again, but they settled for a penalty goal, which saw them enter the break 19-3 down.\n\nThe visitors came out firing in the second half with Abi Evans navigating her way through a gap in the defence in the opening exchanges, but the Springbok Women cancelled this out in the 49th minute as Aphiwe Ngwevu (replacement centre) scored their first try of the match from a pick-and-go. The successful conversion by Tayla Kinsey (replacement scrumhalf) took their score to 10 points.\n\nScotland winger Rhona Lloyd, however, increased their lead on the scoreboard minutes later, using her raw pace to dash through the defence for the team\u2019s fifth try, but again the Springbok Women hit back with hard-running replacement No 8, Aseza Hele, powering her way through the defence after some good forward play.\n\nThe hosts continued to fight to add to their score in the dying minutes and camped close to the tryline for several minutes, but they were unable to add to their score, while Scotland made the most of their last try-scoring opportunity with Lloyd crossing the chalk for her second try on the stroke of full time after dashing around on the outside for a 38-15 victory.\n\n- SA Rugby", "description": "Springbok Women\u2019s coach Stanley Raubenheimer has praised his team\u2019s character despite suffering a 38-15 defeat in their series decider against Scotland.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/44a7a269b09f4ad9b866613aa84784e6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
