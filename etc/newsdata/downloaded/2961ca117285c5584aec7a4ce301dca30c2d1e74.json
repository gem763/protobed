Trump declined to comment on whether he would meet with Maduro.\n\nAmong the names being floated as possible Bolton successors are Stephen Biegun, special US envoy on North Korea; Richard Grenell, US ambassador to Germany; US hostage negotiator Robert O'Brien; and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.\n\nTrump was asked whether he would consider easing sanctions on Iran to secure a meeting with its leader President Hassan Rouhani at this month's UN General Assembly and replied: \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\nNorth Korea has denounced Bolton as a \"war maniac\" and \"human scum.\"\n\nBolton has proposed using military force to overthrow the ruling Kim family and US officials have said he was responsible for the collapse of Trump and Kim's second summit in Vietnam in February.\n\nEfforts to engage with North Korea nearly fell apart after Trump followed Bolton's advice in Hanoi and handed Kim a piece of paper that bluntly called for the transfer of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the United States.\n\nThe document effectively reprised Bolton's long-held \"Libya model\" of unilateral denuclearization that North Korea has repeatedly rejected and that analysts said would have been seen by Kim as insulting and provocative.\n\nTrump announced he had fired Bolton a day after North Korea signaled a new willingness to resume stalled denuclearization talks, but then proceeded with the latest in a spate of missile launches.\n\nAnalysts say Bolton's removal could help US efforts to revive the talks but will not make Washington's aim of persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons any easier.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason, David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick; writing by Tim Ahmann; editing by Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was considering five very qualified people to replace John Bolton as his national security adviser.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7959432e22af0987013065-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
