According to a review in the Los Angeles Times, Gorsuch rejects what he claims to have learned in law school \u2014 \u201c\u2018the Constitution is a \u201cliving\u201d document,\u2019 and judges were supposed to decide cases by updating the law to reflect the more enlightened views of today.\u201d Instead, he was \u201cwon over\u201d by the views of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who \u201cargued judges should not act as politicians by changing the law in the guise of interpreting it.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Gorsuch reportedly tells his law clerks: \u201c\u2018Rule No. 1: Don\u2019t make stuff up,\u2019\u201d and \u201c\u2018when people beg, and say, \u2018Oh, the consequences are so important,\u2019 and when they say, \u2018You\u2019re a terrible, terrible, terrible person if you don\u2019t,\u2019 just refer back to Rule No. 1. And we\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: The implicit suggestion that the law and the Constitution are black and white \u2014 and that all that honorable judges need to do is apply its plain language and move on \u2014 is a myth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMembers of the public who haven\u2019t been to law school erroneously glean from this false dichotomy that there are \u201cbad\u201d judges who legislate from the bench by interpreting ambiguous text to serve their (mostly progressive) ideological goals. This would suggest \u201cgood\u201d judges stay in their lane and eschew (mostly conservative) politics because all they are doing is restating the obvious and leaving it to Congress to actually make policy.\n\nThis false dichotomy is a problem because well-meaning people cast votes in elections on the assumption that their preferred candidates will only put the \u201cgood\u201d judges on the Supreme Court.\n\nMuch of the law \u2014 like the Constitution \u2014 is grey. As I tell my law students, if the answers to legal questions were black and white, people could simply Google them. Nobody would pay lawyers hundreds of dollars an hour to simply read the plain words of legal text. The reality is that lawyers are hired to wrestle with ambiguity and argue for one interpretation over another. This is also why we have 5-to-4 decisions on the Supreme Court in cases involving the meaning of constitutional or statutory text. Words are often ambiguous.\n\nThe Constitution is old, too. Ratified in 1788, it\u2019s been amended 27 times, but not enough to set in stone all of the many nuances that its day-to-day application requires in modern life.\n\nThe Supreme Court resolves those nuances, and when it does, that resolution essentially becomes the law of the land. If the court decides to take up a question of the Constitution\u2019s meaning, the court\u2019s decision will operate as the practical equivalent of amending the Constitution \u2014 without the required two-thirds vote of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states. This is true, regardless of whether the decision captured a \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201cprogressive\u201d majority. Critics can assail the justices for \u201cact[ing] as politicians by changing the law under the guise of interpretation\u201d\u2014but it\u2019s an inevitable part of the job of judging.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Constitution is not alone in this regard. For centuries, people have debated the meaning of religious texts. People interpret poetry and fiction, too. We interpret emails and texts from friends, families and co-workers every day, often misconstruing the meaning of plain language in ways that the sender did not intend. Inescapably, a reader\u2019s subjective points of view affect how ambiguities in language are construed.\n\nWhen it comes to ambiguities in the Constitution or in legislation, a perfectly legitimate and honorable approach to interpretation is to start with the text\u2019s plain language. A judge might then look at dictionary definitions \u2014 which are not uniform and vary over time. One judge might believe that the definition in 1788 of the word \u201csearch\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, for example, is preferable to that of a modern-day dictionary. Others might disagree and look to dictionary.com.\n\nSome judges might look to the contemporaneous writings of the framers of the Constitution \u2014 writings that didn\u2019t make it into the Constitution\u2019s actual text \u2014 for interpretive guideposts.\n\nAcross the ideological spectrum, judges also routinely look to the goals and objectives of the Constitution itself in construing its ambiguous language. The Fourth Amendment\u2019s ban on warrantless searches was meant to protect one\u2019s privacy in the home from government intrusion. With that backdrop, a reader of the Constitution might legitimately conclude that the police\u2019s use of a thermal imaging device to monitor radiating heat from a person\u2019s home \u2014 and thus to detect marijuana growing inside \u2014 requires a warrant. In a 5-to-4 decision written by Scalia, the court deemed this activity a search \u2014 even though nobody in 1791 had thermal imaging technology.\n\nIn short, the framers of the Fourth Amendment could not have \u201cplainly\u201d intended that modern-day result by virtue of the \u201cplain\u201d language of that constitutional amendment. The result by the majority, instead, required that the justices balance competing arguments, consider various guideposts to interpretation and make a call.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe problem with originalism as framed by Gorsuch\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t make stuff up\u201d rule is that, by claiming there is only one viable construction of language in the Constitution, it allows judges to disguise their true motives by slapping on an originalist label. If the language is clear, the theory goes, there\u2019s no room for a judge to impose his subjective or political point of view, let alone invoke any compassion for the people affected by the case. Apply the plain language and move on.\n\nThe alternative approach to legal interpretation \u2014 which some people call \u201cfunctionalism\u201d or \u201cpurposivism\u201d \u2014 has judges put their policy goals on the table for the rest of us to see and evaluate.\n\nRecall that a search is about constraining overbearing government power to snoop on people. We can debate whether the warrantless use of a thermal heating device achieves that objective, but in any event, it helps if judges explain the function \u2014 or goal \u2014 of their inquiry and analysis. To suggest that Scalia wasn\u2019t making new law in deciding that use of a thermal heating device is a search is misguided \u2014 and misleading. It\u2019s easy to come up with loads of examples of \u201clawmaking\u201d by the Supreme Court on both ends of the ideological and political spectrum.\n\nJudges judge, after all.
