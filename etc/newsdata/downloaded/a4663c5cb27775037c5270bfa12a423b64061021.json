REUTERS/Yuya Shino\n\nChina\u2019s economy grew 6.0% in the third quarter, less than expected, and the weakest pace in at least 27-1/2 years, as the Sino-U.S. trade war hit demand at home and abroad.\n\nWhile the downbeat data raises the prospect that Chinese policymakers could prepare more measures to boost growth, analysts and market players said Beijing has relatively little room for significant easing.\n\n\u201cHow much traction is monetary policy going to get? If there is any short-term move (higher) here in Asia it will genuinely be only short-term players because we\u2019re not far from printing 5 (percent) in China GDP, and that\u2019s not going to be good for risk assets,\u201d said Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how excited you get about stimulus, it is not going to be good for risk assets.\u201d\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was down 0.17% by 0350 GMT, erasing earlier small gains. Australian shares dropped 0.61% and Chinese blue-chips .CSI300 were off 0.65%.\n\nThe disappointing Chinese data came as Japan\u2019s core inflation slowed to near 2-1/2-year lows in September, raising expectations that the Bank of Japan could add to its already massive monetary stimulus.\n\nJapan's Nikkei .N225 was last up 0.18%.\n\nSterling, which had enjoyed its biggest rising streak since October 1985 and hit a five-month high on the back of the Brexit deal, gave up ground on Friday morning amid doubts that the agreement would receive parliamentary approval. The pound eased 0.31% to buy $1.2848.
