REUTERS/Jose Cabezas\n\nCARACAS (Reuters) - Guatemala\u2019s president-elect on Saturday was denied entry to Venezuela, where he was scheduled to meet with opposition leader Juan Guaido, according to Venezuela\u2019s opposition.\n\nGuaido\u2019s office said on Twitter that Alejandro Giammattei, a conservative who won the Central American country\u2019s presidency in August, landed at the Simon Bolivar international airport near capital Caracas, but \u201cregime officials are impeding his entry.\u201d\n\nGuaido, who leads Venezuela\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly, was recognised as the country\u2019s rightful leader by dozens of other nations in January after invoking the constitution to assume an interim presidency, arguing President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.\n\n\u201cThis is a message for president Guaido: we are with you. Even though they have not let us enter, we will make our voice heard today across the whole continent,\u201d Giammattei said in a video filmed on an airplane and posted by Guaido on Twitter.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Maduro, a socialist, calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.\n\nMaduro has overseen an economic collapse in the once-prosperous OPEC nation, and is accused of corruption and human rights violations.\n\nIn a tweet before Giammattei was denied entry, Guaido\u2019s office called their planned meeting \u201chistoric and without precedent.\u201d", "description": "Guatemala's president-elect on Saturday was denied entry to Venezuela, where he was scheduled to meet with opposition leader Juan Guaido, according to Venezuela's opposition.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440077146&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0FX", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
