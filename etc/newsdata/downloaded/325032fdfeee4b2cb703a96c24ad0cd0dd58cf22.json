His contract expired at the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe Cubs made the playoffs in each of his first four seasons with the team and won a World Series title in 2016, but it became clear throughout the course of a disappointing 2019 that a new voice was needed.\n\nAccording to Mark Gonzales of the Chicago Tribune, the interview process is already underway, and bench coach Mark Loretta got the first crack last Thursday.\n\nJoe Girardi has also met with the team, undergoing an eight-hour interview on Wednesday, while David Ross and Will Venable are scheduled to interview. Carlos Beltran and Houston Astros bench coach Joe Espada join them on the candidate list, per Gordon Wittenmyer of the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nNot to discount the other candidates, but this might come down to Ross vs. Girardi.\n\nRoss has the respect of the clubhouse, but he's lacking in experience. It's also worth wondering if he's too close to the situation as several former teammates are still on the roster from his time with the squad in 2015 and 2016.\n\nGirardi has the experience with 11 seasons and a World Series title with the New York Yankees under his belt, and he comes with a no-nonsense reputation that would largely run counter to what Maddon brought to the table.\n\nIn the end, Ross would seem to provide the perfect mix of continuity and freshness that the team needs as it looks to bounce back.", "description": "The  MLB  manager carousel has been spinning at warp speed since the regular season came to a close.
