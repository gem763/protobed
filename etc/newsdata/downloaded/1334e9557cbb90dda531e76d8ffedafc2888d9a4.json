She had a ghost in her house but it was coffee-maker ghost. Her 48th birthday pi\u00f1ata was cursed (no candy, didn\u2019t even know about putting candy in pi\u00f1atas). She\u2019s referred to her scalp sweat as a \u201chair product\u201d (ok maybe that one is more wishful thinking than mysticism).\n\nAnd now we learn that Aniston has been dabbling in baby witchcraft for decades. I mean, really entry-level stuff, namely referring to her most poignant friend hangs as \u201cgoddess circles.\u201d Aniston told the New York Times in a recent profile that she completed the ritual again for her 50th birthday:\n\n\u201cSeated on cushions, cross-legged on the living room floor, they passed around a beechwood talking stick decorated with feathers and charms, much as they had done for every major event of their lives. They had circled before Aniston\u2019s weddings to Brad Pitt and Justin Theroux. They circled when babies were born, and when Aniston and Theroux had to put down their dog, Dolly. This time they set the circle\u2019s intention: to celebrate how far they\u2019ve come \u2014 and to toast Aniston\u2019s next chapter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so weird. There\u2019s so much doom around that number [50],\u201d Aniston told the Times. This iteration of the gathering was about rejecting that gloom. Aniston, perhaps hesitant to appropriate a term often employed by witches to describe a range of spiritual communions, added that she was wary of being associated in print with the term \u201cgoddess circle\u201d and asked the reporter if she should just call it a \u201ccircle.\u201d Too late!", "description": "In celebration of her 50th birthday Jennifer Aniston says she participated in a \u201cgoddess circle\u201d with some of her closest friends.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/11/11-jennifer-aniston.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
