The lofty idea is to create a global group \u2014 what some are calling a Supreme Court \u2014 by year\u2019s end and make it fully operational by next November. The independent board will judge appeals from users on material that has been taken down from the platform by the company, and it will review policy decisions that the company has submitted to the board.\n\nIt\u2019s much needed. It\u2019s hard to miss the rising dissatisfaction and frustration with Facebook. Users, regulators, politicians and the media have had enough with how it has evolved and how the co-creator and chief executive, Mr. Zuckerberg, has been responding to the many problems that seem to pop up daily.\n\nLast week, we saw yet another controversy over the company\u2019s year-old policy to exempt politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, allowing them to lie in paid advertisements. Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 the Democratic presidential candidate and Facebook\u2019s No. 1 government critic \u2014 gleefully produced a fake ad that appeared on the platform and falsely claimed that Mr. Zuckerberg and his social network support President Trump in the 2020 election.", "description": "The company\u2019s latest plan to police toxic social media content is intriguing \u2014 and even laudable.", "authors": ["Kara Swisher"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/17Swisher1/17Swisher1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
