Now Sokomani has tattoos of his favorites - the Coral Tree, Speckboom and Acacia - twining across his shoulder.\n\nThe Speckboom is a favorite at Sokomani's Shoots and Roots nursery. Spekboom can grow almost anywhere and absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere faster than most other trees in dry conditions, the United Nations says.\n\nLast year Sokomani went back to his school to plant 67 trees on Mandela Day, symbolizing the 67 years that Mandela spent in public service. He co-founded Township Farmers in 2017 to teach children about agriculture and plant trees in schools.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2018, South Africa lost 1.34 million hectares of tree cover, equivalent to a 22% decrease since 2000, according to Global Forest Watch, a monitoring organization run the Washington-based thinktank World Resource Institute.\n\n(Editing by Toby Chopra)", "description": "NAIROBI (Reuters) - This Sunday in South Africa, an accountant, an entrepreneur and a boxing executive are among 20 friends running the Cape Town marathon - with saplings strapped to their backs.", "authors": ["Katharine Houreld"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
