On top of her making headlines by publicly shaming a delivery driver for allegedly stealing her food, it hasn\u2019t been a great few months for the singer\u2019s reputation. So today's news has been a welcome change for Lizzo stans getting seriously tired out of the bad news cycle.\n\n\"I just took a DNA Test, turns out I'm a credited writer for the number one song on Billboard,\u201d tweeted British singer Mina Lioness, after Lizzo gave her an official writing accreditation for her song \u2018Truth Hurts.\u2019\n\nAs you\u2019ll probably be aware, \u2018Truth Hurts\u2019 opens with the line \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch.\u201d It\u2019s a phrase so iconic and inescapable that it\u2019s already become slightly annoying -- it\u2019s been referenced by everyone from Hillary Clinton to whoever runs the Twitter account of Virgin Trains.\n\nBut although Lizzo undeniably popularised the term, she didn\u2019t invent it - Mina Lioness tweeted the phrase in 2017, inspiring a meme in the process.\n\n\"In 2017, while working on a demo, I saw a meme that resonated with me,\u2019 Lizzo tweeted yesterday, \u2018... I later used the line in Truth Hurts... I later learned that a tweet inspired the meme. The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with...\" Lizzo said, to which Mina responded with a series of tweets thanking her.\n\n\"I have received nothing but love from her through our communications, so I truly do thank her\", Mina wrote. But things haven\u2019t always been so rosy between Mina and Lizzo (or Lizzo\u2019s management): the decision to credit Mina is a culmination of a months-long struggle, which began when Lizzo tried to copyright the \u2018DNA test\u2019 phrase, with the intention of using it on a range of merchandise.\n\nBack in August, Mina tweeted: \"What I cannot get over is how brazen Lizzo and her team have been in ignoring my whole presence. They\u2019re doing it because they know I have no capital to address her. I\u2019m just the poor Black girl from London that don\u2019t have a dog in the fight.\"\n\nShe continued: \"All these Black Women in the industry that have been ripped off and stolen from... and Lizzo sat back and let her co-writer steal from me?\"\n\nLizzo wasn\u2019t quite so conciliatory at the time, flatly denying ever having seen the tweet and describing the accusation she stole it as \u2018crazy'.\n\nIt would appear that this situation has now been resolved satisfactorily for both parties, but this isn\u2019t the end of Lizzo\u2019s legals troubles -- she is currently embroiled in a dispute with producer duo the Raisen brothers. They claim they should be given a credit for \u2018Truth Hurts\u2019 because the \u2018100% that bitch\u2019 line was used on \u2018Healthy\u2019, an unreleased track on which they collaborated with Lizzo, along with some other songwriters. Just how many people can claim credit for a single sentence?\n\nUnlike her (eventual) willingness to credit Mina Lioness, this is a charge that Lizzo categorically denies, so much so that she\u2019s taking the brothers to court. Her lawsuit claims that the brothers have \u2018\u2018embarked on an escalating campaign of harassment against [her]\".\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "This is becoming the most hotly contested sentence in music history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1855086c00a00925b9cf7/lede/1571915389776-lizzo-1.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
