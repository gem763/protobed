They said that my chest X-rays were one of the worst they\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNelson went to a local hospital in Payson in late July after several months of mild symptoms turned into a fever and vomiting. From there, she was transferred to Timpanagos Regional Hospital where she was admitted to the intensive care unit and placed in a medically induced coma for three days, according to Fox 13 Now.\n\n\u201cMy temperature was so high, my brain just completely shut off,\u201d she told the news outlet.\n\nMARYLAND REPORTS 5 'SEVERE' VAPING-LINKED LUNG ILLNESS CASES\n\nNelson said her family was told that her illness was caused by her vaping habits. She was eventually diagnosed with eosinophilic pneumonia, which according to the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine is an uncommon acute respiratory illness that varies in severity.\n\nSome cases have been associated with smoking or other inhalational exposures, medications and infections.\n\nAt one point, Nelson said her family was told she may not live.\n\n\u201cMy family seriously thought I had passed away, and when I found that out, it just made me so sad,\u201d she told Fox 13 Now.\n\nHundreds of vape-related illnesses have been reported in at least 22 states, with at least one death. Patients, including dozens of teens, have been reporting shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, fever, nausea and vomiting. Several patients have been placed in a coma and health officials continue speaking out about the uncertainty of long-term effects of vaping.\n\nAs for Nelson, she\u2019s uncertain about what her future holds and is still experiencing chest tightness and needs oxygen at night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very scary, because the doctors don\u2019t know the long-term effects of this,\u201d Nelson told Fox 13 Now. \u201cSo they don\u2019t know what the healing process is even supposed to look like.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, a pediatrician said she had the same discussion with her 17-year-old patient who also wound up in the ICU with lung issues.\n\n\u201cMachines were keeping Tryston alive,\u201d Dr. Mary Suzanne Withworth, medical director of Infectious Diseases at Cook Children\u2019s, said in a blog post.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhitworth said Tryston vowed he\u2019d \u201cnever touch the stuff again.\u201d The same can be said for Nelson.\n\n\u201cAfter going through that, I would never touch a vape again,\u201d she told Fox 13 Now.", "description": "\"After going through that, I would never touch a vape again.\"", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/30/694940094001_6080442962001_6080443754001-vs.jpg"}
