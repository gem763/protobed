After all, lots of the Democrats are doing the opposite: pretending they\u2019re not thinking about vice presidential maneuvering. But keeping your second-choice options open is crucial, and lots of Democrats are working hard to do just that.\n\nWhile offering voters another round of Joe Biden as vice president would be funny, Biden wouldn\u2019t think so, so we can rule that out. We can also rule out Bernie Sanders, who is too old and independent to line up like a party soldier. But just about everyone else, Elizabeth Warren included, would at least consider a number-two spot on the ticket, and some might even be hoping for it. So let\u2019s look at the consolation prize calculations for the non-Biden and non-Sanders candidates.\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nIf her present momentum is maintained, Warren will herself be the nominee, but she\u2019s still playing it safe. Does Sanders need a running mate? Warren has placed herself as much in his corner as possible without committing to a lot of it. Does Biden need a running mate? Hey, Medicare for All is nice, but \u201cI support a lot of plans.\u2026 This isn\u2019t some kind of contest.\u201d As for differences between Biden and Sanders, let Joe and Bernie duke it out. Warren is ready to stand aside and vault past them both, or to join the winner once one of the two is knocked out. She\u2019s kept things vague enough that she can join Bernie\u2019s program or Joe\u2019s depending on the wind, to which she has high insensitivity. If she fails to make the presidential or vice presidential cut, Warren also has more options. Several years ago, people were suggesting she be named Treasury secretary, an idea Warren called a \u201cfun thought.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris\n\nBy tradition, veeps play bad cop on the campaign trail, launching the nastier attacks while the presidential nominee sways above it all. (Donald Trump reversed this tradition, allowing Mike Pence to stay amicable while Trump stayed obnoxious and thus in his element, but Trump\u2019s approach doesn\u2019t demand the same of his opponents.) Cue Kamala Harris, who is combative, elastic, and calculating\u2014in short, perfectly vice presidential. She practices her attacks thoroughly, and, on the likability front, she isn\u2019t at risk of outdoing anyone. She would be appealing to Biden, because, given the zeitgeist, an old white male nominee will face pressure to pick someone younger, female, and nonwhite as a running mate. Since Harris has also attacked Biden for racial sensitivity, she has the power to grant him implicit absolution. If she didn\u2019t get picked as vice president, Harris could be confirmed as attorney general without much trouble. Still, she likes her job in the Senate too much to make that a likely possibility.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg beats Harris in the polls now, and he\u2019s a fine politician, but he doesn\u2019t bring seasoning, so he\u2019d be low on the list for Warren or Harris. He also doesn\u2019t bring economic leftism or racial or gender diversity, so he\u2019d be out of the running for Sanders. His best hope would be that Biden got the nomination and wanted to send a strong message of centrism and youth and implicit indifference to identity. But if picking Buttigieg would help win over wavering white male (and LGBTQ) voters, it would entail a loss of enthusiasm from many nonwhite, non-male voters. It would also cue a thousand \u201cslap in the face\u201d headlines, something no one wants to read, including those writing them.", "description": "Bernie\u2019s a loner and Warren wants to win, but Kamala, Pete, and Booker might be playing for the consolation prize.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "T.A.
