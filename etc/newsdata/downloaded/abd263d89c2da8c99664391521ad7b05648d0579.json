There has not been a 19th, as quarterbacks have won every year since, with only three runners garnering a vote.\n\nThat may change this year thanks to the force that is Christian McCaffrey.\n\nLeading the league in rushing attempts (127), rushing yards (618) and second in total touchdowns (9) through six weeks, the Carolina Panthers\u2019 star running back is morphing into a superstar in front of our eyes.\n\nMcCaffrey, who has also caught 35 passes for 305 yards, had 866 scrimmage yards through five games, which had him on pace for 2,771, a mark that would break Chris Johnson\u2019s NFL record by more than 250 yards.\n\nChristian McCaffrey (Flag & Anthem)\n\nWere it not for his versatility, McCaffrey \u2014 who is also a brand ambassador for Flag & Anthem and rocks their threads when he isn\u2019t rocking his Carolina uniform \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have a shot at breaking Johnson\u2019s record, but he\u2019s made himself into the biggest dual-threat in the NFL, and opposing defenses have yet to figure out how to stop him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to be versatile,\u201d McCaffrey tells InsideHook. \u201cFrom an offensive perspective, your game plan can change week to week based upon your opponent. As a running back, I need to be able to do multiple things in order to give us the best chance to win.\u201d\n\nOne of those things is catching the football, something McCaffrey excels at.\n\n\u201cIt is certainly something I have worked on throughout my career and continue doing so today,\u201d he says. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s part of wanting to be able to help the team as much as possible so being able to be used in multiple ways is my goal.\u201d\n\nThe 23-year-old probably got some pass-catching tips from his dad, three-time Super Bowl-winning wide receiver Ed McCaffrey, but apparently that\u2019s not the best advice he got.\n\nChristian McCaffrey with the ball against the Los Angeles Rams. (Grant Halverson/Getty)\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things he stressed was recovery,\u201d the younger McCaffrey says. \u201cThe NFL season is long, and you always want to be available to your team so taking the necessary steps in the training room is something he stressed to me early on.\u201d\n\nMcCaffrey also takes steps outside of the training room as his weekly routine includes sleeping almost 10 hours a night, a daily nap, a strict diet prepared by a personal chef and a mid-week recovery day that incorporates options like a pool workout, sauna time, a contrast bath and cryotherapy.\n\nOne thing his in-season routine doesn\u2019t include? Cheat days.\n\n\u201cDuring the season I really don\u2019t have a cheat day,\u201d McCaffrey says. \u201cMaybe during the bye week, I will indulge in something that I wouldn\u2019t normally eat during a regular week. Nutrition is such a vital component to feeling well and performing so I am always conscious of how I will be affected by what I put into my body.\u201d\n\nLuckily for McCaffrey, the Panther go on their bye this week after playing over the weekend in London against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nChristian McCaffrey (Flag & Anthem)\n\nIn addition to possibly indulging in a bag of Doritos or some sushi, McCaffrey may find time to play the drum kit he purchased after seeing Miles Teller in Whiplash.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about music and it is certainly a big part of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI just appreciate the work that it takes to become really good at something, and music is one of those things that can be so detail-oriented in terms of training but also allows for the most creativity.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen Run CMC discover holes in the line that don\u2019t exist and then burst through them with the precision of a surgeon, you know that playing running back the way he does requires the exact same blend of training and creativity.", "description": "Leading the league in rushing attempts (105), rushing yards (587) and second in total touchdowns (seven) entering Week 6, McCaffrey is becoming a superstar.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179872757-1-e1570815984207.jpg?fit=788%2C524", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
