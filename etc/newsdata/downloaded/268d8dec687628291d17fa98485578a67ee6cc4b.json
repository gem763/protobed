GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares edge up to 3-month high, dollar marks time before Fed\n\n* Asian stock markets : https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\n* MSCI ex-Japan rises for a third straight day\n\n* Japan's Nikkei hits decade high\n\n* Share sentiment boosted by trade talks, earnings\n\n* Eyes on U.S. Fed rate decision, Brexit developments\n\nBy Swati Pandey\n\nSYDNEY, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Monday to a\n\nthree-month high as risk assets got a fillip from hopes of a\n\nU.S.-China trade deal as soon as next month while the dollar\n\nmarked time as focus shifts to a U.S. rate decision.\n\nIn early Asian trades, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific\n\nshares outside Japan added 0.2% for its third\n\nstraight day of gains to 518.29, the highest since late July.\n\nJapan's Nikkei was also upbeat, rising 0.3% to a\n\ndecade high.\n\nThe gains came after a positive session in U.S. and European\n\nmarkets on Friday.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials are \"close to finalising\" some\n\nparts of a trade agreement after high-level telephone\n\ndiscussions on Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office\n\nand China's Commerce Ministry said, with talks to continue.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said he hopes to sign the\n\ndeal with China's President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in\n\nChile.\n\nThe protracted trade war between the world's largest\n\neconomies has hurt manufacturing activity, exports and business\n\nconfidence globally while denting profits of many major\n\nindustrial firms.\n\nOptimism that Beijing and Washington were finally close to\n\nresolving their dispute led the S&P500 to surpass its\n\nJuly 26 closing record of 3,025.86, though it ended a tad below\n\nthat level on Friday. The S&P 500's total return index\n\nposted an all-time high.\n\nE-mini futures for the S&P 500 started firm on\n\nMonday, extending the positive momentum from last week.\n\nStrong results from companies including Intel also\n\nboosted sentiment in equities market. More than 81% of U.S.\n\ncompanies have beaten Wall Street expectations so far this\n\nearnings season despite concerns about the trade war.\n\nInvestors next await earnings from the likes of Alphabet Inc\n\n, Apple , Facebook and Exxon XOM.N .\n\nActivity later in the week will be dominated by the U.S.\n\nFederal Reserve, which markets expect is all but certain to\n\nlower interest rates at its Wednesday meeting.\n\nThe Bank of Japan meets on Thursday. On Friday, indicators\n\nfor Chinese and U.S. manufacturing will be released.\n\n\"The outcome of the FOMC policy meeting will most likely\n\ndraw the largest market reaction,\" said Richard Grace,\n\nSydney-based chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.\n\n\"We also think the risk is the FOMC will articulate a\n\npause,\" for future rate decisions, Grace added.\n\n\"That means the 27.6% pricing for an additional 25 bps cut\n\nin December will quickly evaporate, sending U.S. yields and the\n\nUSD higher.\"\n\nIn currencies, the dollar index was unchanged at\n\n97.822 against a basket of six major currencies. The Japanese\n\nyen was a tad lower at 108.72.\n\nSterling was last trading at $1.2824, barely changed\n\nfrom Friday's close.\n\nThe European Union agreed to London's request for a Brexit\n\ndeadline extension but set no new departure date. That gave\n\nBritain's divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister\n\nBoris Johnson's call for a snap election. Earlier, sources told Reuters the 27 European Union\n\ncountries that will remain after Brexit hope to agree on Monday\n\nto delay Britain's divorce until Jan. 31 with an earlier\n\ndeparture possible. The euro EUR=D3 trod water too at $1.1083.\n\n\"It feels like the calm before a potential storm, where the\n\nevent risk heats up with political twists and turns, key\n\neconomic data and central bank meetings,\" said Chris Weston,\n\nSydney-based strategist at Pepperstone.\n\nOil prices climbed, supported by optimism on the trade front\n\nand by falling U.S. crude stocks. O/R\n\nU.S. crude CLcv1 rose 6 cents to $56.71 a barrel, while\n\nBrent LCOcv1 gained 5 cents to $62.08.\n\nAsia stock markets https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nAsia-Pacific valuations https://tmsnrt.rs/2Dr2BQA\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n(Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares edge up to 3-month high, dollar marks time before Fed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA7L0F3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
