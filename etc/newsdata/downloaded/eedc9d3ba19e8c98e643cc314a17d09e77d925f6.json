Torn between the legislative and executive branch directives, Kupperman filed a lawsuit last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia requesting that the court decide for him whether he \"should comply with the House's subpoena or with the President's assertion of immunity and instruction that he not appear and testify,\" Kupperman's attorney, Charles Kupperman said in a statement last week.\n\nAccording to his attorney, Kupperman took \"no position\" on whether Congress or the White House should prevail. He only wanted to do whatever the judicial branch deemed to be the lawful and binding course of action.\n\nAbsent a ruling, Kupperman's attorney said he would not appear \u2014 unless the court issues a ruling instructing him to appear.\n\nKupperman was on the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nBolton, too, has not ruled out appearing before Congress. Attorneys for the former national security adviser are consulting with lawmakers about possibly cooperating with the impeachment inquiry, CBS News' Paula Reid reported last week.\n\nReporting by Margaret Brennan.", "description": "Charles Kupperman faced both a congressional subpoena to appear and an order from the White House not to appear for a closed-door deposition Monday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/21/6f331b53-6f66-4c55-82e0-d2ca053a13e4/thumbnail/1200x630/91bb7ca9dedbc74599f503d67bc99d88/2018-12-21t205712z-426476742-rc1f0061de30-rtrmadp-3-usa-congress-budget.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
