(Charles Mcquillan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nVice President Pence arrived Monday in Ireland with an unusual itinerary: He would attend meetings with Irish leaders in Dublin during the day Tuesday \u2014 but spend two nights on the opposite side of the country, at a golf club owned by President Trump.\n\nPence spent both Monday and Tuesday nights at Trump International Golf Links & Hotel in Doonbeg, in a small town on Ireland\u2019s southwest coast, returning to the village after meetings with Ireland\u2019s top elected officials.\n\nPence defended that decision \u2014 which required him to fly to Dublin and back on Air Force Two \u2014 by saying that he wanted to visit Doonbeg so that he could have dinner with his family at Morrissey\u2019s, a pub here owned by a distant cousin.\n\nPence had visited the same relative in 2013, before Trump was president. In Doonbeg, Pence said, Trump\u2019s hotel was the only one that made sense.\n\n\u201cIf you have a chance to get to Doonbeg, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s a fairly small place, and the opportunity to stay at the Trump National in Doonbeg, to accommodate the unique footprint that comes with our security detail and other personnel, made it logical,\u201d Pence said at a news conference Tuesday outside the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence in Dublin.\n\nFor Pence, the choice to stay in Doonbeg meant about four hours in transit. On Tuesday, he spent one hour in a motorcade from the golf resort to Shannon Airport, then another hour or so on the 140-mile flight to Dublin, then took another motorcade to his meetings. Then he did it all over again, in reverse, that evening.\n\nFor Trump, however, that itinerary meant more revenue, as U.S. taxpayers paid for rooms for Pence and his traveling party.\n\nMarc Short, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, said that Trump himself had suggested that Pence stay at the Trump hotel, after hearing about Pence\u2019s trip.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when we went through the trip, it\u2019s like, \u2018Well, he\u2019s going to Doonbeg because that\u2019s where the Pence family is from,\u2019 \u201d Short said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you should stay at my place.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a, \u2018You must.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t like, \u2018You have to,\u2019 \u201d Short said. He added that the government had negotiated room rates with Trump\u2019s hotel. The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to questions about Pence\u2019s stay that were sent Tuesday afternoon.\n\n[Pence praises courage of Polish people on 80th anniversary of start of World War II]\n\nTrump himself visited the Doonbeg golf course earlier this year, during a trip to Europe to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day landings. Trump skipped Dublin altogether and instead met with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at an airport close to Doonbeg.\n\nThat means twice in one year, American leaders have now visited a quiet village in County Clare and stayed at a once-obscure golf resort that Irish business filings show has not turned a profit in years.\n\nTrump bought the Doonbeg course out of foreclosure in 2014, paying $11.9 million. The course then reported losing more than $1 million every year from 2014 to 2017, according to Irish corporate records.\n\nIn 2018, the course\u2019s revenue rose slightly \u2014 up about 2 percent from $14.2 million to $14.5 million, according to Trump\u2019s latest U.S. financial disclosures.\n\nBut those disclosures do not show whether the course turned a profit, and the Irish records that would show profit or loss are not yet available.\n\nDemocrats have seized on Pence\u2019s stay to suggest that Trump is seeking to enrich himself from government business.\n\nA tweet Monday from the Democratic National Committee noted that Trump was playing golf at one of his properties in Virginia at the same time Pence was staying at a Trump property in Ireland.\n\n\u201cYour tax dollars: making the Trump family richer,\u201d the tweet said.\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) also weighed in with a tweet directed at Pence.\n\n\u201cYou took an oath to the Constitution, not to @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Lieu wrote. \u201cFunneling taxpayer money to @POTUS by staying at this Trump resort is sooooooo corrupt.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution bars presidents from taking \u201cany other Emolument from the United States\u201d beyond the presidential salary. Trump\u2019s critics have charged that he is violating that provision when his hotels take payments from the federal government. Trump says there is no violation if the government is only paying him for services rendered.\n\nConservative commentator Bill Kristol, a frequent Trump critic, also faulted the arrangement, suggesting Pence was trying to curry favor with Trump so that he would remain on the Republican ticket next year.\n\n\u201cHow worried must Pence be about being dumped from the ticket to go these lengths to spend . . . taxpayer dollars at a Trump resort?\u201d Kristol wrote.\n\nPence\u2019s visit to Ireland was planned for later this month. It was rescheduled after Trump decided to skip a ceremony in Poland to mark the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II, citing the need to monitor Hurricane Dorian. Pence took his place, and moved up the Ireland trip so he could go on the way to Poland.\n\nWith the trip suddenly moved up, aides said it was too difficult to find a secure location elsewhere in Ireland on short notice. So Pence went to Doonbeg for two nights.\n\n\u201cWe took the Ireland component that was at the back end of the trip and moved it to the front, because it had already been secured by Secret Service. They had done all the advance work. And the facility, we knew, was safe and protected.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Trump\u2019s earlier taxpayer-funded visit paved the way for Pence\u2019s: Short said the White House was already familiar with the property.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind, the Secret Service has protected that facility for him, too, so they sort of know the realities, they know the logistics around that facility,\u201d Short said.\n\nShort said he thinks this is the first time Pence has stayed at a Trump property. But his political action committee has spent money at a Trump property before: In January of this year, Pence\u2019s Great America Committee spent about $87,000 to hold a \u201cMAGA Leadership Summit Dinner\u201d at Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2013, Pence and his family traveled to Doonbeg, where Hugh McNally, a distant cousin of the vice president, runs Morrissey\u2019s pub.\n\nPence returned to Morrissey\u2019s, also known as Morrissey\u2019s Bar & Restaurant, Tuesday evening after returning from Dublin. McNally greeted Pence and his family as a crowd gathered and cheered his arrival.\n\nTrump\u2019s sons, Don Jr. and Eric, visited the pub in early June. It is a short drive from the Trump property.\n\nThe last vice president to visit Dublin was Joe Biden, in 2016: He stayed at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence, according to news coverage.", "description": "The vice president and Marc Short, his chief of staff, defended an arrangement on a government trip that has drawn criticism from Democrats, who contend it is helping to enrich Trump.", "authors": ["Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress", "David A.
