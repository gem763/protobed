There are, of course, many coming of age films but none, I think, as poetic and haunting as this. It was the first film my eldest son took me to see and at 18 he was just emerging out of the chaos of adolescence meanwhile his two younger brothers were still in the labyrinth... with some years to go. As a mother and a teacher no other film has come close to reminding me how hard it is to leave, or be forced to leave, the relative certainties of childhood and form your own moral code in an adult world beset by compromises.\n\nLives of Others (2006)\n\n\u2018I expected to see it in the top 10\u2019: skoolboyerror\n\nI expected to see The Lives of Others and Pan\u2019s Labyrinth in the top 10. Mainly because Ted is in at No. 60. Much as I love Seth McFarlane, his film doesn\u2019t deserve to be anywhere near either of those masterpieces.\n\nI cannot fathom how The Lives of Others is not listed. The greatest and most poignant last line of any film ever. cwiseman\n\nNo Country for Old Men (2007)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Kubrickianly good\u2019: sulcus\n\nNo Country for Old Men was better than There Will Be Blood in 2007 and still is. It\u2019s more exciting, but underneath that, it\u2019s about how our society\u2019s changing structure has gradually but steadily rewarded the behaviour of psychopaths, and punished the behaviour of the socially motivated. That\u2019s not an over deep reading of the film. That\u2019s what Tommy Lee Jones actually discusses in voiceover. This encroaching darkness he can\u2019t understand, compared to his father\u2019s experiences in the same job. It\u2019s fantastic in every way, right up to its abrupt end with a random car accident. It\u2019s clearly the best film of this century so far, it\u2019s Kubrickianly good. Better than most of the Kubricks actually, it\u2019s close to perfect.\n\nPaddington 2 (2017)\n\n\u2018Basically it\u2019s amazing\u2019: Invader_Ace\n\nPaddington 2 is perfect. A solid simple story, with every little throwaway joke actually a set up for something bigger later on. All the cast are on point and it has a superb ending that finishes at exactly the right point. It commits to its emotional moments without the need to undercut with a sarcastic jibe or punchline. Basically it\u2019s amazing and if you aren\u2019t moved by that final shot you\u2019re basically dead inside. I wish my kids watched it more often and that is something no parent says about any family/kids film ever.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paddington 2 Photograph: PR Company Handout\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)\n\n\u2018I thought it was amazing\u2019: Laoi Primorac \u00d3 Murch\u00fa\n\nIt was the weekend of the Spurs West Ham FA Cup match (if League or League Cup please shout). Was watching in a bar off the main street with girlfriend and friends. We\u2019d already mused the possibility of the cinema that day and CTHD was on at some hour cutting into the game. Okay, whatever, off we went, me and my blonde bombshell. I thought it was amazing, still do. She said it was the most stupid movie ever. I missed the Hammers in action for that sort of reaction? I knew then it was not to be.\n\nSon of Saul (2015)\n\n\u2018Traumatic subject, devastating film\u2019: Veltatecla\n\nSon of Saul for me. I took twice the length of the film to watch it, paused it often to breathe. It\u2019s a film I wouldn\u2019t watch in a cinema, I had to watch it privately. Traumatic subject, devastating film, I was almost glad when the group died as they inevitably would so there was no chance of being returned. The appearance of the little boy and the only smile in the film, half smile, slight smile, made it OK for the man to die. It\u2019s not my right to be thankful that people died so maybe I took the cowardly way out by being something akin to relieved that I didn\u2019t have to see, think and feel anymore.\n\nYour Name (2016)\n\n\u2018It covers every emotion I want in a film\u2019: bcdcdude\n\nWhen thinking of my best films of this decade (I have yet to work out the best between 2000 and 2009), it was a three-way tie between The Tree of Life, Our Little Sister (by Shoplifters director Hirokazu Kore-eda) and Your Name. I\u2019ve decided to go for Your Name, for the simple reason that it covers almost every emotion I want in a film; joy, wonder, sadness, curiosity, longing, loving and the sheer thrill of being alive to watch something so amazing. I\u2019ve watched it three times and each time, it makes me cry. Very few films have ever done that, but to make me cry with simultaneous joy and sadness is a very rare feat.\n\nTimbuktu (2014)\n\n\u2018Funny and tragic\u2019: ID4460697\n\nGreat list, but my top winge is the omission of Timbuktu. Against a stunning landscape and the old city, the Taliban enforce their version of Islam on tolerant ancient local Muslim culture. Some really cinematic acts of defiance the boys show such as forbidden to play football they play with an imaginary ball. A woman stately as a queen, her bright African prints trailing the dirt owns the street in her defiance of sharia fashion. Funny and tragic.\n\nThe Fall (2006)\n\n\u2018I can watch this over and over again\u2019: Cheryl, 60, Leeds\n\nI love this film because it is so multi layered. On the surface is the intriguing situation of the main players in the hospital where they are being treated, Roy, the paralysed stuntman who is clearly seeing his life unravel after a life changing accident on a film set and young Alexandria, the little girl who has broken her arm and initially seems to be the silent narrator as the film unfolds as observed by her. The relationship that develops between them provides a growing emotional tension as he begins to narrate a fairy tale for her in exchange for her collusion in helping him procure the drugs he needs to end his life. The film sets, colour and imagery in this film make it something I can watch over and over again alongside the superb acting of the key characters.\n\nDownfall (2004)\n\n\u2018A tremendous performance from the late Bruno Ganz\u2019: Heather, 38, London\n\nIt\u2019s a controversial choice, but I love 20th century history, so this biopic of Hitler\u2019s last days in the bunker is a film that has stayed with me over the years. It\u2019s a great film, with a tremendous, underrated performance from the late Bruno Ganz. It is both fascinating, horrifying and tragic. And, of course, it\u2019s the only film to have an afterlife as a YouTube meme, a specific 21st Century phenomenon, with that brilliant scene of Hitler realising the war is lost, being overdubbed with all sorts of daft stuff.", "description": "From No Country for Old Men to Paddington 2, Guardian readers on the best films of the 21st century so far", "authors": ["Guardian Readers", "Rachel Obordo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fcbcedf1f283e34874f02ceeb1f7b72f13eddc1/0_50_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75d4fedf0c25097c879afc79badf1c08", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
