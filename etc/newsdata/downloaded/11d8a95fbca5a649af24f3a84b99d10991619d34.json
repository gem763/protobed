They're all groups, but they're all different'.\n\n\"Sometimes you've got to take a break of at least a year, two years, between signing one kind of group and then launching another.\n\n\"It's the same with The X Factor . You can't just keep making the same show that it was 14 years ago and expect it to be the same show today.\n\n\"You've got to take a step back for a little while.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
