(Speaking of, where is our Gritty origin movie? Is he an alien or something? What\u2019s with his bellybutton?). But we have to assume we\u2019re going to get some backstory in Disney\u2019s upcoming live-action Inspector Gadget movie, based on the 1983 animated series, which featured Get Smart actor Don Adams as the voice of its titular detective.

French Stewart starred as Inspector Gadget in the movie\u2019s 2003 sequel, leaving the door open for a newer, darker, much more violent portrayal in the upcoming reboot. Oh, that\u2019s right.
