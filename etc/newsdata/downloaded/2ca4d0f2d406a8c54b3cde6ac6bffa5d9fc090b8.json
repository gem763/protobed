Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, objected to continuing the hearing without a response from the White House to a letter requesting that all senators on the committee be allowed to see the Federal Bureau of Investigations\u2019s background check investigation into Mr. Issa, who served in Congress from 2001 to 2019.\n\nIt was unclear what in the file was objectionable. Mr. Menendez, however, said he wanted the committee to see the file because it contained \u201cpotentially disqualifying information.\u201d\n\nMr. Issa, reached after the hearing, said he believes it pertained to him using fake identification when he was a member of the Army when he was 17-years-old.\n\n\u201cCandidly what he\u2019s referring to in the file, goes back 48 years,\u201d Mr. Issa said. \u201cI was disciplined for having an ID card that falsely indicated I was older than when I was.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Menendez didn\u2019t supply more information on the reason why he objected to Mr. Issa\u2019s confirmation. A spokeswoman for Committee Chairman Jim Risch didn\u2019t say if Mr. Issa\u2019s fake identification was what was of concern to Mr. Menendez.\n\nFBI background checks are standard for nominees and generally only seen by a two members of the committee because they may contain sensitive information.\n\nSenators from both parties asked to view the file. Mr. Risch eventually announced the confirmation would be delayed until the White House made the file available. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get this file open,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Menendez also objected to information in the FBI file of Marshall Billingslea, who was nominated to lead the State Department\u2019s human rights activities, but that confirmation hearing proceeded as scheduled.\n\nAs of Thursday, it had been a year since Mr. Issa was nominated to lead the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. The delay may fuel his political ambitions to once again run for a House seat.\n\nThe former congressman has lived a colorful life that has led to financial success. After his military service in the 1970s, he was indicted on charges of auto theft but was never prosecuted. Mr. Issa has described the accusations as cases of mistaken identity. He went on to build a successful vehicle alarm company.\n\nDuring his tenure in Congress he was one of its wealthiest members. As chair of the Oversight Committee, he investigated the Obama administration. After surviving a tight race in 2016 for his San Diego-area seat, he didn\u2019t run for re-election last year.\n\nNow, Mr. Issa, 65 years old, is considering challenging GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter for his Southern California seat. Mr. Hunter was indicted last year on charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, and violating campaign finance laws, and Democrats hope to use the legal challenges to make the seat competitive.\n\n\u201cIt really boils down to somebody\u2019s going to have to run that can be elected to hold that seat if we\u2019re going to retake the House now or in the future,\u201d Mr. Issa said. Republicans must win a net 19 seats in 2020 to retake the House majority.\n\nMr. Issa represented part of Mr. Hunter\u2019s district during his time in Congress. Last year, a Democrat won the seat that Mr. Issa held previously.\n\nAsked on Thursday about Mr. Issa potentially entering the race, Mr. Hunter shrugged and said, \u201cThat\u2019s politics.\u201d\n\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com", "description": "Darrell Issa\u2019s effort to take a Trump administration trade job hit another snag when the former GOP congressman\u2019s hearing was delayed because lawmakers objected to not being able to see his FBI background file.", "authors": ["Natalie Andrews", "Natalie.Andrews Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108963/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
