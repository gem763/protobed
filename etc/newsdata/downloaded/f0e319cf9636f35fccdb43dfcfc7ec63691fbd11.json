Well!", "language": "en", "text": "Candidates accepted this invitation to wax nostalgic about their wide-ranging lives. \u201cWell, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives,\u201d said South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nA vocal cross-section of the debate audience, however, bristled at an Ellen-premised question in light of the session\u2019s omissions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLAST QUESTION IS ABOUT BIPARTISAN FRIENDSHIP AND NOT CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THIS.\n\n\n\nI JUST... I can't. \u2014 Leah Stokes (@leahstokes) October 16, 2019\n\nThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration.\n\n\n\nClimate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.\n\n\n\nBut you know, Ellen.#DemocraticDebate \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 16, 2019\n\nThe debate indeed stayed away from climate change, so we asked the New York Times and CNN: Why? The New York Times declined to comment on the matter. A CNN source responded that the network had recently staged a seven-hour town hall event on the climate crisis with Democratic candidates. Here was an opportunity, said the source, to get to other topics.\n\nAnother way of looking at the same set of facts: If your network feels that climate change is sufficiently important to warrant a marathon town hall event, why isn\u2019t it sufficiently important to warrant a single question at a more widely viewed debate? It would have fit nicely at any point over the three-hour affair, including at the very outset.\n\nThe chance for another hard-edged public policy question at Tuesday night\u2019s clash, however, fell victim to a shibboleth of television news. For decades, television producers have group-thought their way into the idea that viewers need fluff toward the end of their broadcasts. Tune in to most cable-news shows, and you\u2019ll see the spawn of this mind-set \u2014 a segment about a dog or a family reunion, or a funny video or some other triviality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cEllen question\u201d is the primary-debate incarnation of this TV-news tradition. And it\u2019s by no means the worst of its kind. Consider that during an October 2007 debate with Republican presidential candidates, then-CNBC host Maria Bartiromo asked then-Sen. Fred D. Thompson (Tenn.) at the end of the affair: \u201cSenator Thompson, this was your first debate. How did it feel?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like home,\u201d responded Thompson. \u201cI didn\u2019t say which kind of home.\u201d\n\nA late-stage question to Texas Gov. Rick Perry during a January 2012 Republican debate hosted by ABC News, Yahoo! and New Hampshire television station WMUR went like this: \u201cSo if you weren\u2019t here running for president, Governor Perry, what would you be doing on a Saturday night?\u201d asked George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. Perry responded, \u201cI\u2019d probably be at the shooting range.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn May 2007, Chris Matthews \u2014 the glib, longtime MSNBC host \u2014 stretched the format a bit when he asked Republican candidates quite a hypothetical. \u201cSeriously, would it be good for America to have Bill Clinton back living in the White House?\u201d Clinton had completed two terms in office years before, so the question was a touch moot on a constitutional level. \u201cYou have got to be kidding,\u201d quipped candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nOthers: During the 2016 primary cycle, CNN\u2019s Cooper asked Democratic candidates in a closing question to cite they enemy they\u2019re most proud of. Jake Tapper, also of CNN, pressed Republican candidates on which woman they\u2019d put on the $10 bill, what Secret Service codename they\u2019d prefer (Sen. Rand Paul: \u201cJustice Never Sleeps\u201d) and how the world would \u201clook different\u201d at their end of their presidencies.\n\nMark Lukasiewicz, dean of the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, says that the close-out question is often the result of compromise between the host network and the candidates. In those negotiations, the candidates commonly lobby for closing statements, the better to speak their mind on issues that may have been neglected in the proceedings; the networks commonly \u2014 and correctly \u2014 counter that closing statements are boring. So they agree that the moderator will throw out queries like Tuesday\u2019s \"Ellen question\" to be answered by each candidate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s \u201croom\u201d for such close-out questions, argues former CNN/U.S. president Jonathan Klein, so long as the debate hosts don\u2019t sacrifice time for policy matters. \u201cIt\u2019s just as okay for them to do that as it is for the Washington Post to have a comics section,\u201d says Klein, who now serves as chairman of subscription video platform TappTV.\n\nOne hundred percent. Yet the late-stage debate questions about personality, codenames and whatnot are obsolescing as the media world splinters. The candidates \u201cappear on \u2018Ellen\u2019 and \u2018The View\u2019 and [Stephen] Colbert and other programs \u2014 plenty of places to show that lighter side of themselves,\u201d says Lukasiewicz, who served as senior vice president of specials for NBC News. Though Lukasiewicz thought the debate moderators performed well, the dissatisfaction with the \"Ellen question\" means something: \u201cI think people say, \u2018No, when they\u2019re on the stage to debate, let\u2019s have them debate.' \u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Soft, stupid question from Tuesday night's Democratic debate follows in a puny tradition.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-ztYxw1KHtLHOYzSWN9QpYYW7q8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3LG3J6XP7YI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
