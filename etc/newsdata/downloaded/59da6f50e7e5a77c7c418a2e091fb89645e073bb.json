Baldwin is a board member of the group and has been an outspoken critic of Trump.\n\nVirginia is one of only four states holding legislative elections this year and the only one where partisan control of the legislature is up for grabs. National groups view Virginia as a warmup to the 2020 presidential cycle and are pouring money into the state.\n\nBaldwin has been very vocal about his distaste for the Trump administration in the past, most notably by way of his over-the-top impression of the president on \u201cSNL.\u201d Although he\u2019s previously stated he\u2019d rather a meteor take out the building than continue to play Trump on the hit sketch series, he confirmed he'll still do it. Baldwin recently revealed to \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon that the show\u2019s creator, Lorne Michaels, convinced him to stick around a little longer.\n\nALEC BALDWIN, WIFE HILARIA REVEAL SEX OF BABY NO. 5 SIX MONTHS AFTER ANNOUNCING MISCARRIAGE\n\n\u201cI said to them, and it was not with any malice or any lack of affection for them, I said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t want to do that anymore, I don\u2019t want to do the Trump thing again. I\u2019m going to stop.\u2019 And I don\u2019t need to tell you about the Lorne Michaels\u2019 Jedi Mind Trick thing,\u201d Baldwin explained.\n\nHe continued: \u201c[Lorne] gets me on the phone the Friday before the show, the day before the show, and he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand,\u2019 and I go, \u2018What don\u2019t I understand? I\u2019ve been thinking about it all summer. Every day I\u2019ve been thinking about it.\u2019 And he said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you understand how important this is.\u2019\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cSo [Lorne] said to me, \u2018You should come and do it, your audience demands it\u2019 or something like that,\u201d Baldwin concluded. \u201cSo I came, and I did it. And I\u2019m going to do it a few times.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Alec Baldwin is taking a step away from political satire toward political activism by campaigning for Virginia Democrats.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Alec-Baldwin-Getty-001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
