China denies meddling in the city.\n\nThe initially peaceful protests have degenerated into encounters between baton-wielding riot police and activists, leading to scores of injuries and about 1,300 arrests.\n\nThe demonstrations have taken a toll on Hong Kong's economy, which is on the verge of its first recession in a decade. Hong Kong visitor arrivals plunged nearly 40% in August from a year earlier as tourists steered clear of the city.\n\nStephen Schwarz, head of sovereign ratings for the Asia-Pacific region at Fitch Ratings, said the agency's downgrade of Hong Kong last week reflected damage to the city's reputation as a place to do business.\n\n\"The downgrade reflects months of ongoing conflict environment which are testing the 'one country, two systems' framework and which have inflicted damage to the international perception of the quality and effectiveness of Hong Kong's governance and rule of law as well as the stability of its business environment,\" Schwarz said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFOREIGN FORCES\n\nChinese officials have accused foreign forces of trying to hurt Beijing by creating chaos in Hong Kong, and they have warned outsiders to keep out of what they call an internal affair.\n\nOn Monday, former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the anti-government protests were not an internal Chinese matter and the United States should offer at least moral support to the demonstrators.\n\nAfter three months of unrest, Lam last week withdrew a controversial extradition bill that had triggered the unrest, but the gesture failed to appease many demonstrators.\n\nAnger over the now-shelved extradition bill has triggered opposition to Beijing that had waned after 2014, when authorities faced down 79 days of pro-democracy protests in the central business district.\n\nNow, three months of protests have evolved into a broader backlash against the government with demands for democracy re-emerging as a rallying cry.\n\nLam called for dialogue.\n\n\"Escalation and continuation of violence cannot solve the issues faced by our society now,\" she told a news conference.\n\n\"It will only deepen the conflict, contradiction, splits, and even hatred in society.\"\n\nThe protests, beamed live to the world since June, have prompted some of the city's powerful tycoons to appeal for calm.\n\nIn his first speech mentioning the unrest, billionaire Li Ka-shing urged political leaders to offer young people an olive branch, calling them \"masters of our future\", according to an online video of remarks to a small crowd during a monastery visit on Sunday.\n\nLam said her administration's actions, including the bill's formal withdrawal, were \"not directly to stop these protests and violence\".\n\n\"It is really to express my sincerity to start a dialogue with the people,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting By Clare Jim, Felix Tam, Farah Master, Lukas Jobs, Donny Kwok, Noah, Sin, James Pomfret, Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel)", "description": "An escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in Hong Kong, the leader of the Chinese-ruled city, Carrie Lam, said on Tuesday, adding that she deeply regretted interference by foreign parliaments in the Asian financial hub's matters.  \"It's extremely inappropriate for foreign parliaments", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Farah Master"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/N4iQzaKpVwlukHViVDj7hg--~B/aD0yOTk7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/334704a5f2504c2b33cdffa8d25bec2f", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
