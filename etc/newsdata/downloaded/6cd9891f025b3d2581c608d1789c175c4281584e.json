We are going to impose a moratorium on deportations,\u201d Mr. Sanders said Saturday at an event focused on Latino voters. \u201cThere are some things that a president can do with executive orders and some things you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCritics of Mr. Sanders, including many conservatives, seized on the comments, saying such a deportation policy would be akin to having open borders. A spokeswoman for Mr. Sanders said the moratorium would be in place temporarily while an audit is completed.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s current perch among the most immigration-friendly 2020 candidates differs sharply from his situation in his previous presidential bid. At the time, the Vermont lawmaker was forced to defend comments in which he described some forms of legal immigration as detrimental to American jobs, a sentiment echoed by President Trump as well as many labor unions.\n\nMr. Sanders opposes ICE raids and deportations because \u2018immigrants make our communities and our economy stronger,\u2019 a spokeswoman said.

Mr. Sanders said the bill didn\u2019t have sufficient protections for labor.\n\n\u201cIf poverty is increasing, and if wages are going down,\u201c Mr. Sanders, then a freshman senator, told CNN in 2007, \u201dI don\u2019t know why we need millions of people to be coming into this country as guest workers who will work for lower wages than American workers and drive wages down even lower than they are right now.\"\n\nSo far in 2020, Mr. Sanders\u2019s rhetoric has hewed closer to the pro-immigration wing of his party, but his views appear unchanged. A spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign said he opposes ICE raids and deportations because he \u201cbelieves that immigrants make our communities and our economy stronger.\u201d She said, however, that he is calling for changes to visa programs because he believes large corporations \u201chave exploited an underclass of guest workers.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal this summer, Mr. Sanders said he wasn\u2019t opposed to guest-worker programs, but he felt that Americans should be given first priority for jobs.\n\n\u201cHere we have in the state of Vermont \u2026 thousands of young people who are snowboarding, and they\u2019re skiing, and they know how to do these things pretty well. And yet, if you go to some of the resorts, what you would find is that people from Europe and elsewhere were coming in as ski instructors,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\n\n\u201cIf there is nobody who wants to do it, fine, you bring in people from elsewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you certainly make it clear that people in this country have first dibs on those jobs.\u201d\n\nHis pushes to make it tougher for employers to bring in high-skilled foreign workers have been supported by a slate of labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, which has called for changes to the current guest-worker visa programs.\n\nA Sanders administration would require higher wages for people receiving high-skilled H1-B visas and would make such visas portable so recipients don\u2019t have to stay at one company to maintain their work status, according to his campaign. Mr. Sanders would also raise enforcement standards to make sure foreign-worker visas can be used only to fill gaps and not displace existing workers.\n\nThe Trump administration, since taking power in 2017, has changed the allocation process for H1-B visas, which are coveted by Silicon Valley companies, while reducing the number of visas secured through outsourcing companies.\n\nMr. Sanders and some other liberal Democrats voted to kill the 2007 immigration package, joining with most Senate Republicans. Two of Mr. Sanders\u2019s rivals for the presidential nomination in 2020, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden, voted in favor of the legislation.\n\nMr. Sanders later voted for a bill to give people who came to the U.S. as minors legal status, and he supported a bipartisan 2013 immigration bill that would have created a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He also criticized the Obama administration for carrying out large-scale ICE raids and deportations.\n\nAli Noorani, executive director of centrist advocacy group America Is Better, said that Mr. Sanders is attempting to satisfy both immigration activists and labor but that he could struggle to get bipartisan support for his ideas if he is elected.\n\nSo far, Mr. Sanders appears to be appealing to both constituencies.\n\nAdrian Reyna, strategy director for immigration group United We Dream, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s deportation pause would offer immigrant families breathing room as policy makers \u201cdo the work of laying out the vision for the way the current immigration status quo should change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s really important for the next president to take action to stop the pain that\u2019s being caused in the immigrant communities,\u201d Mr. Reyna said.\n\nJoe Burkhimer, a union member and electrical lineman from Bucks County, Pa., said he supports limits on legal immigration because some trades worry about immigrants taking their jobs for lower wages.\n\nBut he said antiunion laws have hurt American workers most. \u201cImmigrants aren\u2019t the problem,\u201d Mr. Burkhimer said.\n\n\u2014Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Eliza Collins at eliza.collins@wsj.com. and Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders wants to temporarily halt deportations, decriminalize crossing the border and end ICE raids, despite his long-held concern that too much immigration could hurt American workers.", "authors": ["Eliza Collins", "Joshua Jamerson", "Eliza.Collins Wsj.Com", "Joshua.Jamerson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108135/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
