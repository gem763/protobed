Debbie Lesko, Arizona Republican, said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is centered on allegations that President Trump attempted to pressure Ukrainian President Zelensky to open investigations for his own personal gain, lead by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees.\n\nOver the past two weeks, several Republicans not on those committees have tried to get access to the secret depositions and transcripts of those meetings, but this is the largest group to attempt it.\n\nHowever, as the minority party, Republicans don\u2019t have many options to force their hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate that they [Democrats] have the votes and apparently they are not following any procedures, any precedents, any rules,\u201d Ms. Lesko told The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, if we are in the majority, I would not allow this kind of unfair process to go on,\u201d she added.\n\nFor weeks Republicans have slammed the process as a \u201csham\u201d that has shut the American people out of the process by keeping the meetings with witnesses behind closed doors. They\u2019re repeatedly demanding Democrats need to hold a vote to authorize the investigation and accused those running the investigations of ushering out \u201ccherry-picked\u201d leaks.\n\nThey\u2019ve decried what they see as a lack of due process for the president, arguing the identity of the whistleblower that first put forward the allegations should be revealed.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats are bypassing constitutional norms and basic standards of due process with their impeachment obsession,\u201d Rep. Mark Walker, North Carolina Republican, said. \u201cThe president is not above justice. But, as you know, neither is he below it.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats have launched their own defense of the investigation, arguing it\u2019s akin to the special prosecutor investigations that were a part of the Nixon and Clinton impeachment.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated a letter from more than 300 members of the American Constitution Society that argued there is no right to having the whistleblower come forward publicly nor are House Democrats constitutionally obligated to authorize the investigation with a full House vote.\n\nThey did, however, argue the Senate must have a public trial, should the process get that far.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
