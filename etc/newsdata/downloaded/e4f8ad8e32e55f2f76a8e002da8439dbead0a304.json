Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to questions from the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, The Wall Street Journal reported that the government is shutting down half of its oil output after the drone strikes, which amounts to a loss of about five million barrels a day - or roughly 5 percent of the world's daily production of crude oil. Sources said Saudi Aramco held an emergency board meeting on Saturday to manage the unfolding crisis.\n\nThe oil facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then later transports onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\nThe Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.\n\nThe plant has been targeted in the past by militants. Al Qaeda claimed suicide bombers tried but failed to attack the oil complex in February 2006.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Riyadh said it was unaware of any injuries to Americans. Saudi Aramco employs a number of U.S. citizens, some of whom live in guarded compounds in the kingdom near the site.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the wake of the drone strikes and expressed the United States' readiness to cooperate with the kingdom in supporting its security and stability, according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington. Trump said recent attacks against Saudi state-run oil facilities have had a negative impact on the U.S. and global economies.\n\n\"These attacks against critical infrastructure endanger civilians, are unacceptable, and sooner or later will result in innocent lives being lost,\" U.S. Ambassador John Abizaid, a former Army general, said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition has been battling the rebels since March 2015. The Iranian-backed Houthis hold Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world's poorest country.\n\nThe war has become the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The violence has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and killed more than 90,000 people since 2015, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks the conflict.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The world's largest oil processing facility and a nearby oil field in Saudi Arabia were set ablaze early Saturday morning after reported drone attacks by Yemen rebels.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/aramco-fire-Reuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
