(\u201cOink for your sausages, piggy!\u201d Logan yells, during a game whose rules he has written, to people whose livelihoods depend on his largesse.) But humiliation is also currency within the series that tells the Roys\u2019 story. Succession is an itchy show. It is a uniquely visceral show. It takes characters who assume that their wealth makes them meaningfully different from everyone else and finds new ways to remind them that they are incorrect. Greg may stand to inherit, through an accident of chromosomal collision, a quarter of a billion dollars; the sand mites that have taken residence on his person, however, care not at all about that. This is the crux of Succession\u2019s satire: Whatever the show\u2019s characters might have to say about it, nature has a way of biting back.\n\nIn August, as Succession\u2019s second season was getting underway, the writer Aaron Bady argued that the show\u2019s execution, and its \u201chalf-baked class politics,\u201d failed to condemn the Roys in the way early episodes had suggested it might. Succession likes its characters too much, Bady suggested\u2014and therefore makes its viewers like its characters too much\u2014to interrogate the problems of unfettered capitalism as sharply as that subject deserves. \u201cIt is amazing who you can be made to sympathize with, if you are made to watch them suffer,\u201d he noted, citing Kendall\u2019s tragedies, Roman\u2019s comedies, and Shiv\u2019s attempts to secure the approval of a father who doubles as a boss. When King Lear is told through the eyes of the children, those children, Bady wrote, \u201cbecome too pitiful to hate.\u201d Eating the rich becomes much less appealing when the rich are so wounded and charming.\n\nA show about extreme wealth\u2014particularly one that aims for satire\u2014will always walk a fine line. Succession laughs at the Roys, and it laughs with the Roys, and viewers might well find it difficult to determine where the one ends and the other begins. But the idea that Succession is too soft on its subject overlooks the aspect of the show that is both ambient and elemental: its gross physicality\u2014its ongoing suggestion that the world the Roys inhabit is at once impossibly expensive and deeply disgusting. Succession might have empathy for its characters; it has exactly zero sympathy, however, for the environment that contains them.\n\nAmericans are accustomed to discussing the corporate world in ecological terms: landscapes, ecosystems, poaching, pouncing, clashes between the victors and the vanquished. Succession, in one way, capitulates to the metaphors. The Roy family considers capitalism itself, for the most part, a struggle to be won. They hunt. They regard people as prey. They try their best to bag the elephants. But they also treat money the way only very wealthy people are able to: as a mere abstraction. Roman buys a Scottish football team just because he can. Logan forgets how many houses he owns. Connor, not content with a role as a Broadway producer, launches a presidential campaign\u2014one premised on the idea that the wealthy should pay no more in taxes than those who have not been so fortunate.", "description": "Infestation.
