(In fact, according to some economists, any time a company commands more than 25 percent of a given market, it can begin to exert anti-competitive pressure.) And that\u2019s the position that the search giant Google finds itself in.\n\nStatcounter, the analytics company, has the data. As of July 2019, Alphabet\u2019s Google search engine commanded 92.19 percent of online queries. Coming in second place was Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine, with a whopping share of 2.61 percent. Yahoo, the one time champion, didn\u2019t even crack 2 percent of the market.\n\nGoogle\u2019s astonishing stranglehold on search provides it with an extraordinary amount of power, both economic and cultural. The search engine is by far the largest generator of online ad revenue; in 2019, Google expects to book nearly $46 billion in advertising dollars. In second place is the social media giant Facebook, projecting more than $25 billion in ad takings this year. Those two sites essentially constitute an online advertising duopoly, gobbling up ever larger percentages of Internet ad spending. Other sites \u2014 be they newspapers, also-ran social media networks and search engines, or entertainment sites \u2014 have seen ad revenues decline as the duopoly grows ever stronger. This situation does not a healthy marketplace make.\n\nGoogle\u2019s search dominance creates a positive feedback loop whereby competitors are unable to gain a foothold. Advertisers, after all, want to place spots where the eyeballs are. And the eyeballs are at Google. So, other search engines are unable to scare up enough revenue to challenge Google meaningfully. Meanwhile, the company has gotten in trouble, notably in Europe, for favoring its own sites on its search engine. Talk about the company store.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of Google\u2019s immense cultural and political power. Billions of Google searches occur a day. The company\u2019s algorithm, which (opaquely) determines which results are favored and which are suppressed, therefore has a profound effect on what information people have access to \u2014 or don\u2019t. This can be both witting and unwitting. There is not necessarily a knowing conspiracy to favor certain sites and punish others; that could just be the bloodless work of the almighty algorithm. But it\u2019s odd that Google\u2019s auto-complete search, for instance, suggests searching \u201cInstagram,\u201d \u201cMighty Ducks\u201d and \u201cnet worth,\u201d when one types in the name \u201cJussie Smollett.\u201d None of the top nine suggested queries is \u201choax.\u201d\n\nState attorneys general, both Democratic and Republican, are standing up and taking notice.\n\n\u201c[A] bipartisan coalition of state attorneys general plans to launch as soon as next month a multistate antitrust investigation into major technology companies, including such household names as Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, which owns Google,\u201d this newspaper reported on Aug. 20. \u201cTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, and seven others met in June with U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr \u2018to talk about the real concerns consumers across the country have with Big Tech companies stifling competition on the internet.\u2019 The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, released a statement acknowledging that \u2018we continue to engage in bipartisan conversations about the unchecked power of large tech companies.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are very real concerns about the immense market power of tech companies from Amazon to Apple. We seem to be living in an era of profound market concentration and ever-growing monopolies. Reining in Google might be a good place to start.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
