When he couldn't produce any ID, he was handcuffed and detained for two hours until Ottawa police arrived.\n\nBoyce wasn't charged with any crime, and was released.\n\nToronto lawyer Esi Codjoe, former vice-chair of the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, was asked to investigate the incident itself, as well as how the university's security policies may have contributed to it.\n\nOn Tuesday, U of O president Jacques Fr\u00e9mont released Codjoe's report.\n\n\"The report concludes that race was a factor in the incident,\" Fr\u00e9mont said. \"It also concludes that the university's outdated operational procedures and inadequate training was a second factor in the incident. I accept this report and its findings.\"\n\nJacques Fr\u00e9mont, president of the University of Ottawa, said the report concluded that race and inadequate training played a role in a June carding incident involving a black student. 0:48\n\nFr\u00e9mont said he was initially surprised to hear about the incident, \"yet, as a human rights lawyer I should not have been. I know how much the pursuit of inclusivity remains an ongoing struggle in society at large.\"\n\nWithout naming Boyce, Fr\u00e9mont then offered an apology.\n\n\"I'm deeply sorry for the way you were treated and for the humiliation you experienced. I apologize to you for what happened. It was unacceptable and it was wrong.\"\n\nJamal Boyce called the June incident 'humiliating and messed up.' (@Jamal_KB/Twitter)\n\nFr\u00e9mont then apologized to the community at large, and especially to members of the university's racialized community.\n\nFr\u00e9mont outlined the steps the university has taken to prevent similar incidents, and said he has met with Boyce and asked him to join an advisory committee looking at ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\n\"I continue to have full confidence in our protection services officers,\" Fr\u00e9mont said. \"It was my belief before the incident, and it is still my belief now, that overall the University of Ottawa remains a safe, accepting and inclusive community.\"\n\nIn September, another black U of O student, Wiliston Mason, said he was shocked when a security guard blocked his way and demanded identification at a university residence, where Mason works as a community adviser.\n\nIn a statement, the U of O said the security guard worked for a private firm under contract with the university, and would no longer be allowed on campus.", "description": "An independent investigator hired by the University of Ottawa to look into a carding incident involving a black student\u00a0has found that both race and inadequate training played a role in the incident.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5148153.1558702752!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/university-of-ottawa-generic-stock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
