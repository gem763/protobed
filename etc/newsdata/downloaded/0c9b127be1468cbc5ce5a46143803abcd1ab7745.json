Passengers urged him to sit down and asked the crew to get him off the plane.\n\nJust about to take from London city airport.

He was ultimately forced off by police and arrested when the plane returned to the gate. A statement from Aer Lingus said he was scheduled to travel on the flight and was removed \u201cdue to disruptive behavior on board.\u201d The plane underwent a full security check before leaving at 11:16 a.m. local time.\n\nIt was just one of many acts of protest Thursday at the airport, where dozens of activists from the Extinction Rebellion movement had planted themselves at an entrance, according to the Guardian. Some had glued themselves to the floor, the paper said.\n\n\u201cBy non-violently shutting down this airport, in homage to the style of the Hong Kong democracy protesters, we are demonstrating the utter frailty of the transport systems that countries such as ours, unwisely, have come to depend upon,\u201d said an Extinction Rebellion spokesman, Rupert Read, according to the Guardian.\n\nVideo footage showed a man climbing on top of a British Airways jet that was bound for Amsterdam. A woman streaming video of the act from the Facebook account Extinction Rebellion UK said he was a partially sighted former Paralympic athlete named James Brown.\n\n[Extinction Rebellion: Meet the climate protesters blocking traffic in cities around the world]\n\n\u201cWe need to encourage people to fly less,\u201d the woman said. Her video stream ended after about 22 minutes when police told her she was under arrest on suspicion of aiding and abetting the endangerment of an aircraft \u2014 apparently for helping the man get a ticket \u2014 and public nuisance. At that point, the man remained sprawled on top of the plane.\n\nA British Airways statement said people from that flight have been booked on alternative flights to Amsterdam, and the airport confirmed in an update at 2 p.m. local time that a booked passenger had climbed on top of a plane and said other operations were unaffected.\n\n\u201cMetropolitan Police are in attendance and we are working with all partners to investigate, and ensure the safe and secure continuation of service,\u201d the update said, adding that \u201ca number\u201d of protesters were still outside the front of the terminal.\n\nPolice said in the early afternoon that they had arrested \u201ca number of people\u201d outside the airport and one person on a flight on the runway. Authorities said they would deal with activists \u201crobustly but proportionately.\u201d\n\n[Europe\u2019s \u2018flight shame\u2019 movement doesn\u2019t stand a chance in the U.S.]\n\n\u201cOur policing plan is aimed at preventing criminal activity which poses a significant safety and security risk to the airport, and the thousands of passengers using it,\u201d Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said in a statement.\n\n\u201cTargeting an airport and inconveniencing travelers in this way is wholly unacceptable and irresponsible,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe consequences of committing offenses at airports are serious; individuals breaking the law are being, and will continue to be, arrested and prosecuted where appropriate.\u201d\n\nAs of 9 a.m. United Kingdom time Thursday, police had made 842 arrests, totaled over the course of several days, across London that are connected to the Extinction Rebellion protests.
