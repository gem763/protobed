Last week, Spanish giant Barcelona announced it expected to pass the \u20ac1bn ($1.1bn; \u00a3883m) income mark for the first time this season.\n\n'Rebuilding'\n\nDespite the record revenues executive, Manchester United's vice-chairman Ed Woodward said the club still valued playing success on the field most highly.\n\nHe said: \"We remain focused on our plan of rebuilding the team and continuing to strengthen our youth system, in line with the philosophy of the club and the manager.\n\n\"Everyone at Manchester United is committed to delivering on our primary objective of winning trophies.\"\n\nFor the current financial year he forecast revenue of \u00a3560m to \u00a3580m, down from \u00a3627.1m, and core profit of \u00a3155m to \u00a3165m, down from \u00a3185.8m.\n\nThe club said that during the past year it had signed three new first team players and completed several key player contract extensions.\n\nPlayer wages\n\nIt said it had also announced 10 new or renewed global sponsorship deals, and that - as measured by Kantar - its total number of fans and followers globally had increased to 1.1 billion.\n\nDuring the year the Old Trafford club also made an operating profit of \u00a350m.\n\nStaff wages for the year, mostly spent on players, were \u00a3332.3m, an increase of \u00a336.m, or 12.3%, on the previous year, \"primarily due to investment in the first team squad\".\n\nThe club spent more than half of its income on player wages, despite a campaign in which no trophies were won.", "description": "However, the team expects revenue to fall in 2019-20 after failing to make the Champions League.", "authors": ["Bill Wilson", "Business Reporter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14F7A/production/_108928858_mediaitem108928857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
