It didn\u2019t go down well with China banning the Comedy Central series and removing all references to the show from its internet.\n\nNow, Zedd has revealed he\u2019s no longer allowed in China and has been asked to cancel any scheduled shows he had in the country.\n\nTaking to Instagram, he told followers: \u2018I just got permanently banned from China because I liked a @southpark tweet. Just to clarify this is NOT a joke.\n\n\u2018The government informed our promoters that if they don\u2019t cancel my scheduled shows in China, they would pull their cultural permits.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeeze.\n\nZedd\u2019s publicist later confirmed the news to CNBC, adding: \u2018This is true, yes, but we don\u2019t have any more info to give you at this time.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has reached out to Zedd\u2019s rep for further comment.\n\nSouth Park doesn\u2019t officially air in China, but many people in the country watch the series via the internet.\n\nNow, any reference or link to South Park has officially been wiped and the show\u2019s creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, released a statement offering an \u2018official apology\u2019 to China amid the drama.\n\nAlthough, we\u2019re not sure how much Chinese officials will like it.\n\nTweeting a link to the full episode, Stone and Parker wrote: \u2018Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy.\n\nRebekah Vardy in floods of tears as she arrives home amid Coleen Rooney's bombshell claims\n\n\u2018Xi doesn\u2019t look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn\u2019s sorghum harvest be bountiful!
