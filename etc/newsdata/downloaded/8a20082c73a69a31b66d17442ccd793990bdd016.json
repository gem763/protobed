He will be only the second CEO at Under Armour.\n\nPlank will remain as executive chairman and brand chief. The 56-year-old Frisk will report to Plank and will take a seat on the board.\n\n\"Having earned the trust and respect of our teammates, customers and shareholders, Patrik's proven track record of industry experience, straightforward leadership style and championship of our brand and culture makes him uniquely positioned to smartly capitalize on the opportunities in front of us,\" Plank said in a statement.\n\nUnder Armour has threatened Nike, landing major deals with Major League Baseball and star athletes like the NBA's Stephen Curry.
