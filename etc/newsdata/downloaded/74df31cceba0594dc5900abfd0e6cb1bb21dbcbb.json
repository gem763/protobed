This \"fleet learning\" capability is an advantage that Tesla CEO Elon Musk says will help the company develop self-driving cars faster.\n\n\"Every time the customers drive the car, they're training the systems to be better. I'm just not sure how anyone competes with that.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk, on Q4 earnings call with analysts\n\nMost important, Tesla uses data from its vehicles to crowdsource advanced technology features like high-precision maps and improvements to Autopilot.\n\n\"What makes Tesla unique is the two-way nature of its data capability.\"\n\n\u2014 Bryant Walker Smith, assistant law professor and AV expert, University of South Carolina\n\nWhat you can do:\n\nYou can contact Tesla to stop sharing basic data, but that could affect your car's operation, prevent software updates and disable some features, Tesla says.\n\nto stop sharing basic data, but that could affect your car's operation, prevent software updates and disable some features, Tesla says.

It recently joined a host of American companies and government agencies in an effort to help define a new international standard for consumer privacy protection.\n\nThe big picture: Big data captured from cars could be worth $450 billion to $750 billion globally by 2030, according to McKinsey.\n\nYes, but: It's not always clear who owns the data captured by vehicles and their networks, an issue that will only get fuzzier once shared, autonomous vehicles are here.\n\nIt's not always clear who owns the data captured by vehicles and their networks, an issue that will only get fuzzier once shared, autonomous vehicles are here.

In 2014, 20 automakers signed a voluntary set of automotive privacy principles.

It might be too late to stop the flow of information, but the challenge is to control how it is used and shared.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "The data it collects can reveal as much about you as about your car.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/bFUKLFDCvulauzhcN5eJqCH9yy4=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/03/12/1552410876358.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-13"}
