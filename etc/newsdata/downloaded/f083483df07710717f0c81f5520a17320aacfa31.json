How right were we? On the list was Charleston, US; recently linked to London via a twice-weekly British Airways flight. We made the case for Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Plovdiv in Bulgaria, both second cities that deserved more tourists. We also predicted that responsible tourism would go mainstream: and in 2019 this one turned out to be the truest of them all.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThere are issues with choosing destinations based on their \u201chot\u201d factor. Last year, Lonely Planet selected Sri Lanka as the number one country to visit in 2019 \u2013 something The Independent\u2019s travel correspondent labelled as \u201ccontroversial\u201d at the time. Just four months into 2019, the Easter Sunday bombings precipitated a Foreign Office travel ban for the country and tourism is still struggling to recover.\n\nSo how do we choose our picks? We\u2019ve always favoured second cities and under-represented destinations around the world \u2013 Osaka instead of Tokyo; Leipzig rather than Berlin; Pittsburgh not New York. We consider places where your money can go much further: city breaks in Kiev, Athens and Vilnius rather than Paris, Barcelona or Rome. And we will be thinking about where we can get to by train, rather than choosing to fly. That covers off most of northern Europe, as well as on the new service to connect Amsterdam to Vienna. One travel desk colleague is ambitiously planning to get the train all the way to Rijeka, Croatia\u2019s third-largest city, which has been anointed a 2020 Capital of Culture. Or perhaps 2020\u2019s prediction will be third cities, rather than second cities?\n\nWe\u2019ll be publishing our best in travel for 2020 list at the end of November \u2013 keep an eye out for it.\n\nYours,\n\nCathy Adams\n\nTravel editor", "description": "This is the time of year where newspapers, book publishers and travel agencies start making predictions about where people will be going next year.
