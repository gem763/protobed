I'm just keeping everything crossed.\n\n(Image: handout)\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\n\"The baby is doing really well. I'm having regular growth scans and they are very happy with his growth.\n\n\"I had a MRI scan halfway through my chemo and they were quite happy that everything seems to be shrinking. It is a relief but it still preys on my mind.\"\n\nRoberta \u2013 mum to Noah, four, and Ezra who is almost two \u2013 discovered she had cancer after her husband Jason, 27, noticed an unusual lump on her neck when she was around six weeks pregnant.\n\nThe nursing assistant, from Stannington, near Morpeth, was referred for hospital tests by her GP.\n\n(Image: handout)\n\nAfter a series of tests, which included three biopsies, she was eventually diagnosed with Hogkin's lymphoma.\n\nDoctors said her best chance of beating the disease would be to start a course of chemotherapy immediately, but they also warned the treatment could pose risks to her unborn child.\n\n\n\nFurther tests revealed Roberta's cancer was a 'stage 2' and that the tumours had spread to her chest.\n\nAnd as the chemotherapy drugs began to cause her hair to fall out, Roberta took the bold decision to shave her head herself.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nBut now, half-way through her treatment, Roberta's tumours appear to be shrinking, although due to her pregnancy she is not able to have a 'positron emission tomography' (PET) scan, the type of scan that would normally be used to monitor the disease.\n\nShe explained: \"I can't have a PET scan. That's the type of scan they would usually use in these circumstances, it's a bit more accurate, but it uses radiation so they don't like to do that when you are pregnant. But they are still happy with the results of the MRI scan.\"\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nDespite her relief coping with cancer and pregnancy has been unsurprisingly tough for Roberta, who is now 28 weeks pregant.\n\n\"It's not great,\" she said. \"It's incredibly tiring. I have had a cold for about eight weeks which I can't shift and I have got gestational diabetes. And I am constantly stabbing myself with needles.\"\n\nBut having two young boys and another on the way does not give her much time to swell on the disease.\n\nAnd the determined mum has now bought a beautiful near silver wig to wear on the days when she just wants to 'feel normal'.\n\nShe added: \"I don't wear it every day. But it's nice if I want to go out the house and just feel normal.\"", "description": "Roberta Burton is expecting her third child and has spoken of her joy as her latest scan revealed images of a healthy th", "authors": ["Sophie Doughty", "Image", "Handout", "Newcastle Chronicle"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740414.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_sdr_040919_roberta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
