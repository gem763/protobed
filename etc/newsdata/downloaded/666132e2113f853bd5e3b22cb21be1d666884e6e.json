Instead they suggested any giveaways could be made from sustainable materials.\n\nJust hours before Burger King announced its change of policy, rival chain McDonald's said it had no plans to scrap its toy giveaways. Instead customers would be given the option of swapping the toy for a sachet of fruit if they wished.\n\nMcDonald's also plans a trial from early next year, enabling parents to choose between a book or a toy.\n\n\"The gifts provide fun for many families and children. That's why we'll be running these trials, in order to give our customers a choice; they also can choose not to have a toy or gift at all,\" said Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald's UK and Ireland.\n\nBut Burger King said it wanted to undertake \"significant action\" to address the issue of plastic waste.\n\nThe fast-food restaurant chain will provide bins in its restaurants to collect old toys. It said the move would save 320 tonnes of plastic a year.\n\nImage copyright McDonald's Image caption McDonald's says it will still have toys in its Happy Meals, but that toys can be swapped for fruit\n\nHelen Bird, from sustainability campaign group Wrap, described Burger King's response as a \"bold move\", welcoming the in-store collections since plastic toys can't be recycled with plastic packaging at home.\n\nPentatonic, which makes consumer goods from recycled materials, is working with Burger King to recycle collected plastic toys into restaurant items such as trays and play areas.\n\nMost toys today are made from three polymers - polypropylene, ABF and PET.\n\nPentatonic said no harmful gasses would be released to the environment, when these plastics were melted. The melted plastic forms a continuous strip and can then be cut into beads or pellets which are used to manufacture new plastic products, the firm said.\n\n\"If we were to use recycled polypropylene to make a tray, instead of new plastic, total energy consumption would be reduced by approximately 88% and carbon emissions would be cut by approximately 70%,\" Pentatonic's chief executive Johann Boedecker told the BBC.", "description": "The fast food chain says it will no longer give away plastic toys with children's meals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BC93/production/_108857284_detective-picachu-bk1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
