Meanwhile some antibiotics, when mixed with alcohol, can cause sickness and dizziness.\n\n\u201cA DR50 charge means 10 points on your licence and a hefty fine. Our advice would be to swerve the drinks entirely if you know you\u2019re going to be behind the wheel,\u201d Tongue added.\n\nA similar conviction also exists for drug use.\n\nA DR90 conviction - \u2018in charge of a vehicle when unfit through drugs\u2019 - also means 10 penalty points on your licence and a fine of up to \u00a32,500.\n\nA DR50 or DR90 will also stay on your license for four years from the date of the conviction.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, being \u2018In charge of a vehicle\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean driving it. If you\u2019re inside the car and in possession of the keys, you could still be prosecuted.\n\nUK motoring lawyer Emma Patterson, from Patterson Law, said the DR50 and the DR90 codes are a remnant of the old fashioned way the police used to detect and charge people - without having a particular reading relating to either drugs or alcohol.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut it\u2019s still relevant in modern courts, typically used as a form of legal \u2018backstop\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou have a number of potential offences where you can be charged and convicted without being above the \u2018legal limit\u2019,\" Emma said.\n\n\u201cThe sentiment was that the police really disliked having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that somebody was \u2018unfit\u2019 to drive through drink or drugs because they had to prove that the standard of driving was reduced or impaired by alcohol or drugs.\n\n\u201cWhen legal limits were introduced it was far more black and white.\n\n\u201cHowever, the police now tend to use the \u2018unfit\u2019 charge when they are in difficulties, perhaps, for example, when the breathalyser machine does not work properly, or if somebody fails to give a specimen for analysis.\n\n\u201cAnd by reverting to the old charge of being \u2018unfit\u2019, the prosecutor at court can simply refer to their demeanor when arrested and the standard of driving.\n\n\u201cIt tends to be used as a sort of legal backstop.\u201d\n\nEmma added that \u2018potential charges where no reading is required\u2019 could involve a \u2018minimum mandatory 12 month ban\u2019.", "description": "There\u2019s another type of conviction - a DR50 - which means you can still be prosecuted without ever failing a breathalyser test", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18962600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1161575198.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
