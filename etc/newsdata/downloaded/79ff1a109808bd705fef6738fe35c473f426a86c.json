Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) talks to reporters following a Democratic caucus meeting on Sept. 10. (Jonathan Ernst)\n\n\u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) described Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019sinfluence to a New York Times columnist over the summer. Meaning: Her star status and sway on social media are not translating to influencing legislation.\n\nOcasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) just took a step to tangibly measure her influence on Pelosi by shaping who serves in her caucus.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez announced she\u2019s backing a challenger to a sitting House Democrat, Rep. Daniel Lipinski in Illinois. It\u2019s a roundabout way for Ocasio-Cortez to try to influence those actual votes that Pelosi says she has a handle on, by electing people more in line with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s worldview.\n\nFor one House Democrat to try to oust another is a rare thing in traditional Democratic politics, but not from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s perspective. She won election by challenging one of the most entrenched Democratic politicians in the House, Joseph Crowley. If there\u2019s one place she has proven to wield significant influence in reshaping the House Democratic caucus, it\u2019s in a Democratic primary. At least, in her own.\n\nAfter her surprise win in 2018, she promised to help liberal candidates across the country do the same. Lipinski is the first test of her influence outside her own Bronx district.\n\nLipinski isn\u2019t the most dramatic target in the world for Ocasio-Cortez to flex her strength against. A handful of other House Democrats have supported his challenger in the past because he is so conservative for a Democrat; he opposes abortion rights and votes against bills that the LGBTQ community supports, and he voted against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn 2018, groups such as the Human Rights Campaign, NARAL, Emily\u2019s List and Planned Parenthood actively tried to oust him by boosting his primary challenger, Marie Newman.\n\nNewman lost that primary by just two percentage points, and she is running again. Enter Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed her Tuesday. Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) endorsed Newman last week.\n\nThese endorsements didn\u2019t come out of the blue. Ocasio-Cortez and Warren seem to be following the lead of Justice Democrats, a liberal group founded by people who worked for the presidential bid of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2016 and who actively supported Ocasio-Cortez in her primary. So, she has the backing of an entire structured group and a presidential candidate to help make good on her endorsement.\n\nShe would be a little more out on a limb if she endorsed, say, Jessica Cisneros, a primary challenger to another abortion rights opponent, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.). Justice Democrats and Warren want Cuellar out, too, but she would be the first House Democrat to endorse his opponent. For comparison\u2019s sake, we should note that the New York Times reported in January that she pushed back on an article that said she was trying to knock off Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), a Pelosi ally in leadership. That would have been an extremely bold move, and it doesn\u2019t seem like Ocasio-Cortez is going there.\n\nStill, she\u2019s lending her star power to try to tilt a competitive primary race in Illinois right as the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm is trying to tamp down any primary challengers to their elected lawmakers.\n\nThis spring, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (whose leader is closely aligned with Pelosi) announced that its vendors would need to work with incumbents only; they cannot work with primary challengers. The message from the top was clear: The Democratic establishment won\u2019t tolerate primary challengers.\n\nThat led to Ocasio-Cortez to tell her 5.4 million Twitter followers to donate directly to campaigns and circumvent the party's campaign arm.\n\nThe @DCCC\u2019s new rule to blacklist+boycott anyone who does business w/ primary challengers is extremely divisive & harmful to the party.\n\n\n\nMy recommendation, if you\u2019re a small-dollar donor: pause your donations to DCCC & give directly to swing candidates instead.\n\n\n\nSome great ones: \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 30, 2019\n\nThe DCCC said it would not tolerate infighting, and what it got from Ocasio-Cortez was exactly that. On Tuesday, the DCCC didn\u2019t officially respond. But it has not proven receptive to progressive pressure in the not-too-recent past. In May, the DCCC\u2019s chairwoman, Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), decided not to attend a fundraiser for her Illinois colleague, Lipinski, after getting pressure from progressives that the party was supporting an antiabortion Democrat.\n\n[Why the DCCC is in disarray]\n\nTrying to oust that Democrat is the next logical step in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s quest to challenge and change the existing Democratic structure. And it\u2019s the first tangible test of her ability to shape the House Democratic caucus since her own impressive primary win.", "description": "She\u2019s endorsing a primary challenger to one of her colleagues, even though House Democratic leadership is actively trying to discourage primary challengers.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QeelCz8H8qmM4L5jFZn0V1uwjg8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATDH6NGT2YI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
