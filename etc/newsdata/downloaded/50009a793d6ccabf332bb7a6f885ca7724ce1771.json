STICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE! \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nThe White House claims the complaint \"shows nothing improper.\"\n\nPress secretary Stephanie Grisham argued the complaint \"is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings.\"\n\nGrisham said Trump released a rough transcript of his call with Zelensky on Wednesday \"because he has nothing to hide.\"\n\nShe said, \"The White House will continue to push back on the hysteria and false narratives being peddled by Democrats and many in the mainstream media.\"\n\nHowever, House Democrats who have read the document say it's \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nIn opening Thursday's House intelligence committee session, chair Adam Schiff said Trump's actions as detailed read like \"a classic organized crime shakedown.\"\n\nSchiff said the whistleblower shows \"more of a dedication of country, more of an understanding of the president's oath of office, than the president himself.\"", "description": "A redacted version of a whistleblower complaint at the centre of an impeachment probe against U.S. President Donald Trump was released Thursday, and alleges Trump abused his office's power during a phone call with Ukraine's president.
