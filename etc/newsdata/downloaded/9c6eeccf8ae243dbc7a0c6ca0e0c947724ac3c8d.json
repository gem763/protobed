Videos taken from the app have very quickly gone viral, with users sharing videos of themselves swapped into famous scenes from Game of Thrones or the films of Leonardo di Caprio.\n\nBut the huge success has led to immediate questions over what exactly the app is doing with people\u2019s faces and how similar technology could be abused in the future.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOne of the chief concerns is about the privacy of the app. When a user signs up to use it, they approve its terms and conditions and then upload photographs of their face.\n\nThat face is then used to swap into videos including sports or film stars. They can then be passed onto friends.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

ZAO can therefore use personal images, which appear to have been uploaded only to have fun with the app, for its own marketing images.\n\nZAO responded to those concerns on Chinese social media site Weibo. But it did not make clear what exactly it would do, or how it was using those images at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe thoroughly understand the anxiety people have towards privacy concerns,\u201d the company said, in a statement reported by Reuters. \u201cWe have received the questions you have sent us. We will correct the areas we have not considered and require some time.\u201d\n\nThe app has also led to concern around \u201cdeepfakes\u201d \u2013 the technology that allows people to convincingly swap faces into other videos, or to use AI to generate videos of people saying things they have not said. AI experts have repeatedly warned that the technology seen in ZAO could be used to undermine trust, by creating false videos of real people saying or doing entirely fake things.", "description": "A new app that lets people substitute their faces with celebrities\u2019, with uncanny accuracy, has led to major concerns about what else it is doing with its users\u2019 likeness.", "authors": ["Andrew Griffin"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/29/17/iphone.jpg"}
