Give them space and time and they move the ball well and have an offloading game and put you under pressure.\u201d\n\nAfter wins already in Japan over Georgia (43-14)and Australia (29-25), a shock loss to Fiji would not this time end the tournament for Wales, but it would make it harder for them to claim the top spot in Pool D.\n\nAlthough they have already beaten their biggest threat Australia, Jones said that performance was not good enough and they have to lift their game.\n\n\u201cAgainst Australia, first-half we moved some ball quite well but we weren\u2019t as clinical as we\u2019d like to be. Second-half, Australia kept the ball and we were quite limited. From our attacking aspect, we have certainly got factors we need to improve,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrom a personal perspective, I am fully aware of how good they (Fiji) are. We have got to make sure from an attacking element when we have got the ball we keep the ball.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Challenge and an opportunity\u2019 \u2013\n\nHead coach Warren Gatland, who has kept most of his first choice line up together for the first two matches, has called for an explosive start \u201cto hopefully take a little bit of that excitement away from Fiji.\u201d\n\nHe has also demanded an 80-minute defensive effort, mindful that France were almost tipped over by a strong finishing Tonga on Sunday, and it was a later try that won it for Fiji in 2007.\n\nGatland said he has stressed why winning the pool undefeated is important regardless of who they will likely play in the quarter-finals \u2014 which will be decided by next weekend\u2019s clash between England and France.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of benefits about winning the group in terms of turnaround time and choices of hotels and stuff. Psychologically, if you win the group and win your four games, you are up against a team that has lost a game,\u201d he said.\n\nFiji have only a mathematical chance of making the quarter-finals and their realistic best hope is to finish third in their pool to automatically qualify for the 2023 World Cup in France.\n\nCoach John McKee said the historic 2007 result was \u201cone of the great Fijian performances\u201d and he has been using it to inspire his players.\n\nFiji played exceptional rugby in their opener against Australia until early in the second half when a 21-20 lead faded to a 39-21 loss and they were then shocked 30-27 by Uruguay before bouncing back to thump Georgia 45-10.\n\n\u201cWe see this final pool game as both a challenge and an opportunity, it is important to finish the pool stage on a high note,\u201d McKee said.", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Wales will look to ramp up their performance to another level against Fiji on Wednesday, amid constant reminders of their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/af45d0_wales-head-coach-warren-gatland-is-hoping-top-pool-wales-wary-fiji-giantkiller-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
