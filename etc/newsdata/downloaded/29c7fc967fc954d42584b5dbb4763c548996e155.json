And from the very next movement, he picked up from the base of a scrum and crashed into the referee Nic Berry - the Australian official who may claim he deserves to be credited with a tackle on the statistics sheets.\n\nThe Italians conceded a try in the sixth minute to Namibia scrumhalf Damian Stevens against the run of play and wasted three good scoring chances but recovered to post three tries for a 21-7 lead before halftime.\n\nThe Italians scored four more tries in the second half, after some heavy rain, and Namibia added another two to cut the final margin to 25.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of tension among the team - we have been preparing a long time for this game,\u201d said Parisse, who joined former teammate Mauro Bergamasco and Samoa\u2019s Brian Lima as the only players to compete in five Rugby World Cups. \u201cThe important thing was to win, to take the five points. Congratulations to Namibia as well because they never gave up, they played until the end, so congrats to both teams.\u201d\n\nThe Italians finally turned pressure into points and took the lead when Tommaso Allan burst onto a pass and crashed off the upright to score under the posts after a swerving, surging run from center Luca Morisi in the 26th. Scrumhalf Tito Tebaldi darted down the left flank and dived over after receiving an improbable no-look pass from lock Federico Ruzza right on halftime.\n\nThe bonus point was secured four minutes after the break when winger Edoardo Padovani ran onto Morisi\u2019s angled grubber kick to the left corner, and the result was beyond doubt in the 47th when replacement Carlo Canna scored and converted to make it 35-7.\n\nIt rained heavily during halftime, making the ball slippery and reducing the opportunities for attack, but the weather cleared later.\n\nThe Namibians finished strongly, reducing the margin to 35-15 with a penalty goal to Cliven Loubser and a well-worked backline move from a set piece that resulted in JC Greyling scoring untouched in the 57th.\n\nJake Polledri and Matteo Minozzi added the sixth and seventh tries for Italy before winger Chad Plato sprinted 40 meters for a crowd-pleasing try for Namibia at the end.\n\nWhile it was a positive start to the tournament, it extended an unwanted record for Namibia, which has now played 20 games at the Rugby World Cup without a win.\n\nNamibia hadn\u2019t played a test since June, and was the lowest-ranked team at the tournament, at No. 23.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of the players, the way we adapted to the speed of the game,\u201d Namibia coach Phil Davies said. \u201cSome of the tries we scored and some of the resolute defense, I was really happy. But credit to Italy, they put a bit of pressure on and scored at crucial times.\u201d\n\nThe Namibians will play South Africa next Saturday, while Italy has a shorter turnaround and takes on Canada at Fukuoka on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to move on from that pretty quickly. It wasn\u2019t very pretty,\u201d Italy coach Conor O\u2019Shea said. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed with the way we played. We have a job to do in these first two games and you know that\u2019s not the true version of us. But we\u2019ll take five points and we\u2019ll move on quickly.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sergio Parisse started his fifth Rugby World Cup by guiding Italy to a 47-22 win over Namibia on Sunday, and going oh-so-close to celebrating the milestone with a try.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/japan_rugby_wcup_italy_namibia_04000_c0-212-3968-2525_s1770x1032.jpg?0fda21c9ad41b4834762704886d28cbe226dab60", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
