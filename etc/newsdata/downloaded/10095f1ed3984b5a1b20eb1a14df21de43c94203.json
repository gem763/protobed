The order is part of state prosecutors\u2019 investigation into whether The Trump Organization illegally reported a hush money reimbursement as a business expense.\n\n\u201cIn response to the subpoenas issued by the New York County District Attorney, we have filed a lawsuit this morning in federal court on behalf of the President in order to address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case,\u201d Jay Sekulow, a personal attorney for Trump, said in a statement.\n\nA federal investigation into the hush money payments led to the arrest of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to violating campaign finance law and lying to Congress. Shortly before the 2016 presidential election, Cohen gave adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged sexual relationship with Trump. He is now serving out a three-year prison term.\n\nWhile the president has made various promises about releasing his tax returns \u2015 including the apparent lie that he was under audit and could not release them until that process concluded \u2015 he has so far refused to make them public, breaking with decades of presidential tradition.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s sued to prevent them from seeing the light of day. Back in July, he filed suit against House Democrats after the Ways and Means Committee demanded six years\u2019 worth of tax returns.", "description": "The American public has seen personal tax information for every president from Nixon to Obama.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8399a4230000580557d061.jpeg?cache=xj2rlypmgm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
