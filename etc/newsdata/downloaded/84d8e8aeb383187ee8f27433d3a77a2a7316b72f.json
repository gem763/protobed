Then the truth came out.", "language": "en", "text": "Hardly any of the mourners packing Sarasota National Cemetery for the full military funeral on Oct. 1 had met the man they were there to honor. Instead, they had come because of a brief obituary that had gone viral, saying that the elderly veteran had no immediate family and inviting the public to attend his memorial service.\n\nIt was a heartwarming story. But the truth turned out to be slightly more complicated.\n\nAD\n\nAs Sarasota Herald-Tribune columnist Chris Anderson recently discovered, Pearson actually had two sons and had walked out on his family when the boys were teenagers. Until their father\u2019s obituary went viral, they had been under the impression that he was dead. But even though the two men came forward the day before the service, the funeral home didn\u2019t inform the public that Pearson did, indeed, have living family members.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt the very least, it should have been mentioned at the service that family had been found,\u201d Anderson wrote on Tuesday. \u201cIt was not mentioned. Instead, a Legacy Options funeral director spoke about the services his business provides.\u201d\n\nGod bless you, Sarasota. And especially God bless you, Mr. Edward Pearson. We are forever grateful for your service to us and our country. Go rest, Solider. You did a great job. pic.twitter.com/dDuIEnncvZ \u2014 the real slim sadie (@itssadieee) October 1, 2019\n\nOver the past year, services for unclaimed veterans in Tennessee, Michigan, Nebraska and Massachusetts have drawn hundreds of strangers, with veterans\u2019 groups and funeral homes spreading the word on social media. In January, after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper encouraged people to attend an Air Force veteran\u2019s funeral in Texas, more than 1,000 people showed up, creating a traffic jam that stretched for miles. Though the man had been thought to have no family, his daughter saw the media coverage and came forward after the funeral.\n\nAD\n\nPearson\u2019s obituary went viral in a similar fashion. The resident of Naples, Fla., who had served in the Army from 1962 to 1964, died of natural causes on Aug. 31, the Herald-Tribune reported. At the time, there were no known survivors, and a social worker contacted a nearby funeral home that provides free burials for indigent veterans. On Sept. 29, Legacy Options Funeral and Cremation Services published a short obituary in the Naples Daily News, letting people know when Pearson\u2019s memorial service would take place.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis Veteran has no immediate family,\u201d the notice concluded, \u201call are welcome to attend.\u201d\n\nMike Hoyt, the funeral home\u2019s director, told the Herald-Tribune last week that he made \u201ca couple phone calls\u201d to veterans\u2019 organizations, thinking that maybe 100 people would show up. But after local news outlets picked up on the story, it took on a life of its own, and the likes of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tapper and the American Legion encouraged people to show their respects. One Sarasota restaurant even offered a free pizza to anyone who attended, the Herald-Tribune reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe result was a crowd so large that Hoyt, who had driven two hours from Naples, needed a police escort to get to the service. John Rosentrater, the director of the Sarasota National Cemetery, told the Tampa Bay Times that it was the largest turnout he had seen for an unclaimed veteran\u2019s funeral in the cemetery\u2019s 10-year-old history. He suspected that people had been touched by the photo that ran alongside Pearson\u2019s obituary, featuring a smiling, bespectacled man.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a very endearing picture,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cIt could have been my grandpa.\u201d\n\nMany of the strangers who showed up said they were inspired by family members who had served in the military, or that they were veterans themselves. The thought of an elderly man dying alone seemed to strike a chord, and many said they felt a duty to thank Pearson for his service to the country.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just felt the urge to be here,\u201d one veteran told WTSP. \u201cTo make sure that he was not alone.\u201d\n\n.@jaketapper it\u2019s fair to say that Army Vet Edward Pearson was not buried alone in Sarasota, FL today.\n\n\n\n4,000 showed up to #HonorPearson\n\n\n\nThank you for using your platform to get the word out about these unclaimed veteran funerals. pic.twitter.com/DhoDyCzBjD \u2014 Christian Ziegler \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 @FloridaGOP Vice Chair (@ChrisMZiegler) October 1, 2019\n\nFeel-good stories about the impressive turnout appeared in outlets including CNN and USA Today. But for Pearson\u2019s two sons, the funeral provoked a more complicated set of emotions.\n\n\u201cI was kind of surprised he was still alive all this time and I never knew about it,\u201d Edward Pearson Jr. told the Herald-Tribune. \u201cI\u2019m hurt because all these years I could have talked to him and found out why he did what he did to us and why we were lied to.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe 55-year-old told the paper that his father never paid child support after abruptly abandoning his family, and that the last time they spoke was in 1983. For reasons that remain unclear, his father\u2019s second wife passed along the message that Pearson Sr. had died while being electrocuted at work, and, for years, that was what the family believed.\n\nAD\n\nThen, on the day before the funeral, Pearson\u2019s sons found out about their father\u2019s death the same way that thousands of other people did: through social media.\n\nThough it was too late to make plans to travel to Sarasota, the two men contacted the funeral home that same day to identify themselves as the veteran\u2019s immediate family. Blair McFarlane, a member of the Patriot Guard Riders, which volunteers at unclaimed veterans\u2019 funerals, told the Herald-Tribune that it\u2019s not uncommon for relatives to come out of the woodwork at the last possible moment, and that his group will typically get a \u201cstand down\u201d request when that happens.\n\nAD\n\nBut that didn\u2019t happen in Pearson\u2019s case, and the public was never notified that the veteran\u2019s family had been found, even as stories about the funeral proliferated in local and national news outlets. When asked about the omission last week, Hoyt initially told the Herald-Tribune\u2019s Anderson that the family hadn\u2019t wanted their existence to be public knowledge, but later admitted he hadn\u2019t been told that personally.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt first the funeral home stated the family did not want to be involved, but then backtracked,\u201d Anderson wrote in a follow-up column on Tuesday. \u201cLiz Pearson, Edward Pearson Jr.\u2019s wife, said the family would have attended had they learned of the service earlier. The funeral home hung up when asked if they thought they deceived the public.\u201d\n\nThe funeral home did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post late Wednesday night.\n\nMcFarlane had his own theory. If the funeral home had told the full story, \u201cthey don\u2019t get the publicity,\u201d he told the Herald-Tribune. \u201cThey don\u2019t get the crowd for Mr. Pearson.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Edward K.
