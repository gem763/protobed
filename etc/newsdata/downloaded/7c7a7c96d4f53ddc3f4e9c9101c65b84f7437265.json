Dobbins, Chase Young power No. 4 Ohio State past No. 13 Wisconsin", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE SportsPulse: USA TODAY Sports' Paul Myerberg provides his opinion of the top three programs in the history of college football. USA TODAY\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2013 No entity has defeated the Ohio State football team this season, including sloppy, rainy weather.\n\nPlaying mostly in a drizzle and occasionally in a downpour, the No. 3 Buckeyes (8-0, 5-0) rained down enough offensive might to hammer the No. 13-Wisconsin Badgers (6-2, 3-2) 38-7 in a battle of Big Ten heavyweights.\n\nGiven the weather conditions hampered the passing game, this may have been one of the Buckeyes\u2019 most impressive performances this season.\n\nHere are three takeaways from the game:\n\nDon\u2019t forget about J.K. Dobbins: Transfer quarterback Justin Fields and defensive star Chase Young have received most of the attention for the Buckeyes\u2019 undefeated season.\n\nBut Dobbins has been as important as any Buckeye. He rushed for 163 yards (and two touchdowns) against Wisconsin to pass the 1,000-yard mark this season. Dobbins, a junior, is the first Ohio State running back to rush for 1,000 or more in each of his first three seasons.\n\nDobbins has rushed for 100 or more yards in six of Ohio State\u2019s eight games this season and ran 91 yards in another game.\n\nOhio State running back J.K.

But Ohio State\u2019s Chase Young clearly deserves a good look this season.\n\nYoung, projected to be an early NFL draft pick, had a school record-tying four more sacks against Wisconsin to give him 13.5 for the season. He forced two fumbles giving him five the season and had five tackles for loss, giving him 15.5 for the season.\n\nHe led a Ohio State defense that did an effective job limiting Wisconsin\u2019s dynamic running back Jonathon Taylor to 2.6 yards per carry.\n\nUnstoppable offense: The Buckeyes, in bad conditions, put up 38 points and 431 yards against the Badgers, who entered the game ranked No. 1 in total defense.\n\nThey boast a wide array of offensive weapons. The Buckeyes now have 13 rushing gains of 30 or more yards, including five by Dobbins. Last season, they only six ground gains of 30 or more.\n\nNo team this season has held the Buckeyes under 34 points.", "description": "Ohio State running back J.K.
