They basically saved the Syrian regime from collapse.\" Wimmen said.\n\n\"It's become clear that Russia is central to the military equation, simply because of the amount of commitment that they decided to undertake - of money, material and men.\"\n\n\"They've put a lot in this basket.\"\n\nFilling the western vacuum\n\n\"The Russians are in a sense filling the vacuum created by the US departure. While Russia has doubled down on its commitment to Syria, all the western players have continually looked for an exit strategy, one that's now being consolidated by Trump's decision,\" Barnes-Dacey told Euronews.\n\n\"There's nobody else. The Europeans are absent, the Gulf States are absent... almost by default, all runs towards Moscow,\" Wimmen said.\n\nThe situation in northeastern Syria \"has been a complete disaster for Washington and what is a disaster for Washington, almost by default, becomes a success for Moscow, \" the expert added.\n\nPax Russica?\n\nThe Kurds, a longtime western ally, now seem to have no other choice than to abide by the new Pax Russica.\n\n\"Putin has succeeded in looking at both his relationship with Assad but also with Turkey in an extremely strong fashion. And now he offers the Kurds perhaps the only way of mediating between these two actors,\" Barnes-Dacey said ahead of the visit.\n\n\"It all depends on how the SDF and YPG leadership responds to this. It's again an agreement that is made at their expense. It doesn't really look like they were consulted,\" Wimmen told Euronews on Tuesday after the details of the deal were known.\n\n\"But I can't really see they have a choice. If the Russians are behind it and the Turks are behind it, there is nothing they can do about it.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, at least, this will prevent more people from dying and more displacement,\" Wimmer said.\n\nAccording to OCHA, the UN's humanitarian wing, an estimated 180,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or shelters after two weeks of fighting in northeastern Syria. All are in \"desperate need of humanitarian assistance,\" the agency said.", "description": "The Russian-brokered agreement concluded on Tuesday highlights how central President Vladimir Putin has become in the Syrian conflict, experts told Euronews.", "authors": ["Sandrine Amiel"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/23/96/1000x563_cmsv2_cb78d340-1e5d-5f22-9d26-7911c7498595-4252396.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
