US-China trade talks have been the focus of dealers\u2019 attention in the past few weeks. Yesterday Donald Trump tweeted that China's want to make a deal, but do I?\u2019 It was the latest trade themed tweet from Trump, and hours later, the US president said trade talks were going \u2018really well.\u2019\n\n\n\nStocks markets in Europe plus the US rallied yesterday. The positive mood spilled over to Asia, too, as equity markets are showing gains.\n\n\n\nIn the past couple of days, there were reports the US was contemplating concessions regarding Huawei, as well as not pressing ahead with additional tariffs on Chinese imports, in exchange for a pact on the currency markets. Neither side wants to seem to be desperate for a trade deal, but both are clearly interested in making some sort of progress. Otherwise, the negotiations wouldn\u2019t be going ahead.\n\n\n\nSterling soared yesterday after Prime Minister Johnson and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar said the Brexit talks were very positive and very promising\u2019 in addition to that, the heads of government see \u2018a pathway\u2019 for a deal being struck. The process has dragged on, and there have been a few bumps along the way, but yesterday\u2019s message was one of the more upbeat updates. There have been a number of false starts in the ordeal, but for now, traders are content to snap up sterling.\n\n\n\nYesterday we saw some mixed data out of Europe. The UK estimate of three-month growth until August was 0.3%, which topped the forecast of 0.1%. German exports in August declined by 1.8%, while French industrial production dropped by 0.9% in August. The UK, as well as the eurozone, stand to lose out in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and it is clear there continue to be economic woes in Continental Europe, so some clarity regarding Brexit would be welcomed.\n\n\n\nHeadline CPI in the US was unchanged at 1.7%, but traders were expecting it to tick up to 1.8%. The core CPI level held steady at 2.4%, which met economists\u2019 forecasts. The score report is a more accurate reflation of underlying demand, so consumer appetites are unchanged. The labor market remains to be in rude health as the jobless claims report was 210,000, a drop from 220,000 last week. The economic reports shouldn\u2019t put pressure on the Fed to cut rates.\n\n\n\nAt 7 am (UK time), the final reading of German inflation will be posted, and it is tipped to remain unchanged from the flash at 0.9%.\n\n\n\nCanadian unemployment is expected to hold steady at 5.7%, while the employment change is anticipated to show an increase of 10,000. The report will be posted at 1.30 pm (UK time).\n\n\n\nThe preliminary reading of the University of Michigan consumer sentiment is expected to cool to 92, from 93.2 in September. The report will be revealed at 3 pm. This will be closely watched in light of the trade spat with China.\n\n\n\n\u2013 remains in the wider bearish trend, and if the negative move continues, it might target 1.0800. A snapback might encounter resistance in the 1.1100 area.\n\n\n\n\u2013 surged yesterday, and while it holds above the 50-day moving average at 1.2260, it might target the 1.2600 marks. A break below the 1.2200 regions might put the 1.2000 area on the radar.\n\n\n\n\u2013 yesterday\u2019s daily candle has the potential to be a bearish key day reversal, and while it holds below the 0.8900 marks, it might retest 0.8813 \u2013 the 200-day moving average. A break above the 50-day moving average at 0.9014, might bring 0.9148 into play.\n\n\n\nUSD/JPY \u2013 while it holds above the 50-day moving average at 106.91, it could push higher, and 108.47 might be retested. A break below 106.48 might send it to 106.00.\n\n\n\nis expected to open 22 points lower at 7,164\n\n\n\nis expected to open 44 points higher at 12,208\n\n\n\nis expected to open 17 points higher at 5,586\n\nDISCLAIMER: CMC Markets is an execution-only provider.
