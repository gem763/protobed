My source believes the lunch won't happen at all.\"\n\nAugust 29, 2019: Tron communications director Cliff Edwards tells Blocktv the Buffett lunch is being rescheduled. \"It took about two months for us to get all nine people to come to San Francisco and sit in one room for five hours with Warren Buffett,\" he said. \"We are in the process of corralling all of those nine people again to get it back on track.\"", "description": "Crypto whiz kid Justin Sun paid $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett, and invited several blockchain bosses and President Donald Trump to join t...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d77a18c2e22af17f64f39a5-1298/warren-buffett-justin-sun.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
