We raised our children to be as honest as the day is long. Her children must be suffering.\n\n\u2018We believe two of them were in the car and we can\u2019t imagine what they are going through either. She needs to do the right thing and make that decision herself.\u2019\n\nCharlotte also told presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid that she had pleaded with Trump directly to help the family get justice for Harry.\n\nShe appealed directly to Anne Sacoolas and asked her to \u2018get on a plane\u2019 (Picture: ITV)\n\nShe said: \u2018At the end, while leaving the room, he shook all our hands again and I was last in line.\n\n\u2018When he held my hand, I gripped it a lot tighter and I was honest with him and just said, \u201cIf this was your son, surely you\u2019d be doing the same thing\u201d.\n\nMan arrested over family found in secret bunker after nine years is not their dad\n\n\u2018He actually gripped my hand a little bit tighter and said, \u201cYes, I would be\u201d. I told him to please, please, do the right thing, please just try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He said he would try to look at this from another angle. I don\u2019t really know what he meant by that or what time scale we\u2019re expecting, but it felt sincere.\u2019\n\nHarry was killed in a head-on collision with a Volvo, which had been on the wrong side of the road, near RAF Croughton, on August 27.\n\nMrs Sacoolas had been granted diplomatic immunity at first\n\nMrs Sacoolas has previously said she was \u2018terribly sorry\u2019 about the incident, adding that she had \u2018no time to react\u2019 when she saw his motorbike.\n\nShe had been interviewed by police after the crash but then returned to the US after claiming diplomatic immunity through her husband, who is a US intelligence official.\n\nHowever that protection is now in dispute, with the Foreign Office stating it no longer applies because Mrs Sacoolas left the UK.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
