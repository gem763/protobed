Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe tweet was quickly deleted, but not before China took note. On Sunday, the Rockets\u2019 Chinese sponsors, sportswear brand Li-Ning and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center, announced that they were suspending their support of the team. China\u2019s basketball association also said it will stop cooperating with the Texas team.\n\nSoon after, the Chinese government got involved. \u201cWe are deeply shocked by the erroneous comments on Hong Kong made by Mr. Daryl Morey,\u201d the Chinese consulate in Houston wrote in a statement on Sunday. \u201cWe have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets are a popular team in China due to their 2002 drafting of Chinese-born Yao Ming, the most famous Chinese basketball player of all time.\n\nMorey issued a statement in response to the backlash Sunday evening. Falling short of apologizing for his original tweet, he wrote that he \u201cdid not intend to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China\u201d and said he has had time to \u201cconsider other perspectives\u201d since sharing his support for the protesters on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday night, the NBA stepped into the fray, saying in a statement:\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
