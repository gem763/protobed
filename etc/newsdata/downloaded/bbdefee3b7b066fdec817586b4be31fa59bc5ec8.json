HOWEVER there is hope!\"\n\nChad wrote that he had found an American survivor of RMC who had been treated at the Houston clinic.\n\n(Image: chadalexanderuk/Instagram)\n\nHe made swift contact with the clinic and claims they told him an initial appointment alone would cost US $25,000 (about \u00a320,000) before treatment, flights and accommodation.\n\nHe said he and his partner, a nurse, live in Basingstoke with their children.\n\nThey were asking the public and the DJ's fans for help coming up with the funds, which has forced them onto a single income as Chad has been left unable to work due to his illness.\n\nHe wrote: \"Any money you are able to donate will be so greatly appreciated but also please spread the word.\n\n\"If you know anyone who is a sickle cell trait carrier or has sickle cell disease please make them aware of Renal Medullary Carcinoma. My symptoms included blood in the urine, back/ flank pain and weight loss.\"\n\nAccording to the National Organisation for Rare Diseases, RMC is one of the most aggressive forms of kidney cancers, and predominantly affects young men of African descent who carry the sickle cell trait for the disease.\n\nAccording to WebMD , while renal cell carcinoma-type cancers like RMC can be treated, radiation and chemotherapy have limited effectiveness.\n\nScientists are currently exploring new and better treatments and working on drug trials in hopes of fighting the disease.\n\nYou can donate to Chad's fundraising page here .", "description": "DJ Chad Alexander, 30, is desperate to access cutting-edge treatment in the USA for Renal Medullary Carcinoma", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Chadalexanderuk Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20710943.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_rit-dad-of-two-with-cancer-so-rare-hes-second-person-ever-to-be-diagnosed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
