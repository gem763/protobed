Trump recalled Yovanovitch from her U.S. ambassadorship to Ukraine last May after unfounded claims she sought to undermine his policies.\n\nIn her prepared testimony, the former ambassador said the decision by her superiors to remove her was based on \"unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\" The longtime diplomat said she was \"incredulous\" over her removal from the position, despite the State Department's belief she had \"done nothing wrong.\"\n\nYovanovitch on Friday testified privately before House committees leading the impeachment inquiry into Trump, despite previous efforts by the State Department to block officials from being deposed.\n\nThe White House is refusing to participate in the impeachment inquiry, calling it \"unconstitutional\" and the State Department has, thus far, blocked U.S. ambassador to the European Union and Trump donor Gordon Sondland from giving voluntary testimony. Trump continues to maintain that his July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy -- which prompted the impeachment inquiry -- was innocuous.\n\nZelenskiy has also stated that there was \"no blackmail\" in the call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.\n\nAfter President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier in the day stated there was \"no blackmail\" in the July 25 call with Trump, the U.S. leader told reporters, \"We released a perfect conversation. The president of Ukraine just confirmed that and that should be case over.\"\n\nTrump alleges that when Biden was vice president, he threatened to withhold loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the government stopped investigating a gas company on which Hunter Biden held a board seat.", "description": "Ex-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Says Trump Applied Pressure to Remove Her from Post", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/12/2019101200373_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
