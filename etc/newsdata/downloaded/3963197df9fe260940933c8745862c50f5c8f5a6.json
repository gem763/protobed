It\u2019s Alec Baldwin at the front door: Virginia Democrats import celebrity firepower.", "language": "en", "text": "AD\n\nIt was the latest salvo in the celebrity onslaught Democrats are unleashing this year on Virginia voters. Amped up at the prospect of winning control of the General Assembly on Nov. 5, the party has turned to high-profile surrogates to help stir excitement and push voter turnout.\n\nNational groups are eager to sprinkle stardust on Virginia\u2019s normally sleepy off-off year races, when no federal or statewide offices are on the ballot to draw attention. Four states have elections this year but Virginia is the only one where control of the legislature is at stake, providing a tuneup for next year\u2019s presidential showdown.\n\nAD\n\nAll 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for election, and Republicans are defending slight majorities of 20-19 in the Senate and 51-48 in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each chamber.\n\nAD\n\nThrough a Brooklyn-based nonprofit called the Hometown Project, actors and musicians with ties to Virginia have been posting short videos on social media to tout candidates in places where they grew up. Singer Jason Mraz improvised tunes on guitar or piano for several Richmond-area Democrats, somehow setting melodies to lines such as, \u201cand she is running for state Senate District 10, which includes parts of Chesterfield and Powhatan counties and Richmond.\u201d\n\nComedian Wanda Sykes included a shout-out to alma mater Hampton University in praising Hampton Roads area candidates; TV actor Jason George reminisced about growing up in Virginia Beach in several spots for Democrats there; actor Patton Oswalt recorded testimonials not only for Senate candidate John Bell but also for candidates for Loudoun County sheriff and school board.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans are not star-struck.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have accomplishments, or a message, or enthusiasm, you call in C-list celebrities. Which is why Republicans will not be asking for celebrity help,\u201d Garren Shipley, spokesman for House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah), said.\n\nOther than a Northern Virginia fundraiser with Vice President Pence, the state GOP has brought in few outsiders this year. Republicans argue that they are focused on Virginia while Democrats are beholden to interest groups and big national money.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats have hauled in more money from outside the state as they set records for fundraising this year. By the end of August, Democratic candidates had raised about 29 percent of their total contributions from out of state, including both individual donors and single-interest groups, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans had raised only 12 percent from such sources, VPAP found.\n\nBut Democrats had also raised more money from within Virginia, and more from small donors, according to VPAP.\n\nOn Tuesday, Baldwin said there\u2019s a reason a New York-based film and TV star would come to Virginia to visit campaigns in Chesterfield, Fredericksburg and Fairfax Station: If Democrats take majorities in the legislature, he said, they would pass the Equal Rights Amendment \u2014 the 38th and final state needed for the measure to be ratified nationally.\n\n\u201cWhich is something that I\u2019ve always been fairly obsessed about,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cHere\u2019s our chance.\u201d\n\nHe said he had read up on the race between Pohl, a social worker, and the incumbent Chase, who styles herself as a swaggering iconoclast in the mold of President Trump.\n\nAD\n\nBefore Baldwin\u2019s visit, Chase posted a message on Facebook listing his various brushes with authorities \u2014 from getting thrown off a commercial flight in 2011 to last year\u2019s legal dust up in a dispute over a parking space in New York.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe embodies and represents everything [Pohl] claims that she\u2019s against,\u201d said Chase, who campaigned with a celebrity of her own \u2014 singer and Trump supporter Joy Villa appeared at her recent fundraiser at the Country Club of Virginia.\n\nBaldwin said he had read about Chase\u2019s own parking-related drama, in which she cursed at a Capitol Police officer who wouldn\u2019t let her into a restricted area.\n\n\u201cWe have a roll of quarters we\u2019re going to give to Amanda Chase,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWhen she loses this race, she\u2019ll have all the time she needs to drive around Richmond and look for a parking space.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter making a speech to about 70 campaign volunteers and media, Baldwin strode through the neighborhood, chatting with reporters and dropping in on two houses selected by the campaign. The occupants had not been warned, however \u2014 and at Robinson\u2019s house, her grandfather was napping and missed the whole thing.\n\nAD\n\nPohl said she wasn\u2019t worried about campaigning in a district that voted for Trump in 2016 with the man who famously parodies him on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (and Baldwin said he\u2019ll make an appearance on this week\u2019s show).\n\n\u201cPeople are tired of the rhetoric they\u2019re hearing in D.C.,\u201d she said.\n\nAs he prepared to leave, Baldwin hopped into a black SUV and had it turn around just a bit farther down the street \u2014 right in front of Chase\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cI promise you we weren\u2019t trying to troll her,\u201d Pohl said.\n\nChase took note later on Facebook: \u201cSorry! Everyone on this street is Republican and they sure won\u2019t be supporting a socialist. By the way, at 3 p.m. we are all at work.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Outside interest is strong before key Nov. 5 election; GOP says rivals are not focused on Virginia.", "authors": ["Gregory S.
