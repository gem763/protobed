His fantasy proposals to deal with the Northern Ireland border issue have been met with scepticism from the EU and Ireland.\n\n\u201cHis lawyers have revealed he will have to seek an extension to Article 50 despite him saying he would rather \u2018die in a ditch\u2019 than do so. And now ministers in his government are admitting they have \u2018no plan\u2019 for how to proceed after that.\n\n\u201cThis government\u2019s Brexit policy is in total disarray.\u201d\n\nIn a series of newspaper articles, Mr Johnson declared he had growing support for his plan among MPs, who he was encouraged to discover were not \u201cso recalcitrant\u201d in supporting his plans as Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nBut Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes of securing a deal with Brussels in time were dealt a blow, when Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins said the prospect was a \u201cbit of a long shot\u201d.\n\nMr Karins told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cIf we consider that the bulk of the withdrawal agreement has already been agreed upon and we are now fine tuning one issue, albeit a very important issue, but fine tuning one issue, it conceivably is possible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a gambling man so I won\u2019t say what I think the odds are...It may be a little bit of a long shot.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Brexit secretary Steve Barclay signalled the government could shift over the plan to offer Stormont a veto on the plans on its plans for an all-island regulatory system after Brexit.\n\nNo 10 has previous suggested that this was the government\u2019s \u201cfinal offer\u201d.\n\nAsked if they might move on the method, he said: \u201cThe key issue if you\u2019re going to have a regulatory zone in which laws apply in Northern Ireland there has to be consent to that. That is the key issue of principle.\n\n\u201cNow, the mechanism, we\u2019ve set out proposals in our legal text, we can obviously as part of the intense negotiations in the coming days discuss that mechanism.\u201d\n\nMr Barclay said he wanted to get into \u201cintensive negotiations\u201d with Brussels in the coming days and confirmed that talks were underway with Labour MPs to win support for the plans, ahead of a possible Commons vote\n\nHowever, Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy \u2013 who represents Leave-backing Wigan \u2013 said she could support a deal but the \u201cproblem is at the moment, we don\u2019t have a deal\u201d.\n\nShadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti said parliament must be able to scrutinise his proposals but she said his current plan \u201ccannot get through\u201d.\n\nLabour is expected to try to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on Monday to demand the full legal text of the prime minister\u2019s Brexit plan.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cThe legal text is important because we suspect it will confirm that the government\u2019s proposals unavoidably mean the introduction of infrastructure in Northern Ireland, and that this will contradict the assurances Johnson gave in the House on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe also think the text will show how the government plans to replace the current commitments to protect workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Scotland\u2019s highest civil court is expected to deliver a verdict on what sanctions could be applied if the PM refuses to comply with the law.", "description": "Boris Johnson\u2018s government has \u201cno plan\u201d for what might happen if parliament blocks a no-deal Brexit, a cabinet minister has said,\u00a0amid warnings from EU leaders that\u00a0an agreement was a \u201clong shot\u201d.
