Without Alarcon and her army of three other food ninjas (as she calls them) trying out all sorts of fast food possibilities in the HQ test kitchen, Popeyes wouldn\u2019t have a fried chicken sandwich blowing up social media and parent company Restaurant Brands\u2019 (QSR) sales.\n\n\u201cFor us, to watch something like this you created come to life, it\u2019s just an indescribable feeling,\u201d Alarcon told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWhat took so long for this delicacy?!\n\nDespite being one of America\u2019s most beloved fast food chicken chains since it was founded in 1972 by entrepreneur Al Copeland, Popeyes hasn\u2019t had a chicken sandwich on its U.S. menus until now. The focus has always been on serving up flavorful chicken breasts, thighs and legs alongside a host of sides, just like heated rival KFC (which has never been big on sandwiches, either).\n\nAnd that has been a missed opportunity for Popeyes and its rival KFC (YUM).\n\n\u201c[Restaurant Brands International] has indicated the boneless chicken category makes up ~20% of Popeyes\u2019 entr\u00e9e sales mix, highlighting chicken sandwiches could be a meaningful unlock to grow the boneless chicken mix,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSo after two years of finally tinkering with a chicken sandwich that would cater to a more on-the-go U.S. population, the Popeyes team was ready to release its long-awaited creation to the public on August 12. The sandwiches would be offered in two versions: the regular and spicy and retail for $3.99.\n\nIt was time for Popeyes to power up its sales. It was a debut that Alarcon, her veteran team and Popeyes executives didn\u2019t take lightly. After all, Popeyes fans have long clamored for a chicken sandwich \u2014 Alarcon wasn\u2019t about to let them down.\n\n\u201cThe challenge at the time was to come up with something transformational. We set out to say \u2018sandwiches are simple\u2019 but with four ingredients, they have to be the best that they can be,\u201d Alarcon explained.\n\nChallenge won.\n\nWith four seemingly simple ingredients \u2014 a buttered brioche bun, cajun-inspired mayonnaise, a crispy fried chicken filet and naturally-brined pickles, Popeyes had no idea it was about to change the fast food chicken sandwich game in America. Its sandwich blew up the tried and true fast food product release model and most notably how an item is marketed for the first time.\n\n(Yahoo Finance/David Foster) More\n\n\u201cThis is a big moment for our brand. This has been the biggest launch in the history of Popeyes, if not QSR,\u201d Popeyes America\u2019s President Felipe Athayde told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a cultural phenomenon. We just launched the iPhone of chicken sandwiches.\u201d\n\nLet the chicken wars begin\n\nWith all due respect to KFC, Popeyes\u2019 most heated rival through the years has proven to be Chick-fil-A. With an extensive menu of fried chicken sandwiches, Chick-fil-A has a cult-like following and a fan base that swears it is the best chicken sandwich in the U.S.\n\nChick-fil-A\u2019s sandwiches are also simple but the chicken chain doesn\u2019t compromise on quality. The Chick-fil-A sandwiches boast chicken that has no added fillers or hormones, and is breaded daily by hand in its restaurants rather than pressure fried.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Yahoo Finance took a look inside one of the most epic fast-food launches.", "authors": ["Brian Sozzi", "Heidi Chung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/s1DknjTsNajlh1jaRPcbIA--~B/aD0xMDc5O3c9MTA3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/a8d26840-d340-11e9-aecf-73e1dffb1903", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
