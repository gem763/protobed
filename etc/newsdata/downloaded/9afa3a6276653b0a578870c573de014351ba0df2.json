(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping have plenty of reasons to call off their trade war.\n\nBoth face weakening economies that would likely further deteriorate if their conflict escalates.\n\nBoth are up against a formidable adversary that shows no inclination to yield.\n\nBoth are tangled in political turmoil \u2014 Trump with impeachment proceedings, Xi with angry protests in Hong Kong.\n\nBoth, in short, would welcome some good news.\n\nYet the 13th round of U.S.-China trade negotiations, set to begin Thursday in Washington, is unlikely to prove any more successful than the previous 12 in resolving tensions that have rattled markets, threatened global growth and paralyzed business investment in the United States.\n\nThe issues that divide the world's two biggest economies \u2014 mainly over allegations that Beijing deploys illicit tactics in a drive to acquire and develop cutting-edge technology \u2014 are likely too daunting to produce the kind of \"big deal\" that Trump says he wants.\n\nAt least anytime soon.\n\nThe already slim prospects for success grew dimmer Monday when the U.S. Commerce Department blacklisted a group of Chinese tech companies. The Trump administration charges that facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology developed by those companies is being used to repress China's Muslim minority. Beijing demanded that Commerce reverse the move.\n\n\"We urge the United States to immediately correct its wrong practices, withdraw the relevant decisions and stop interfering in China's internal affairs,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.\n\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry warned in a separate statement that Beijing will \"take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard Chinese interests\" but gave no details of possible retaliation.\n\nThe U.S. stock market tumbled Tuesday \u2014 the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 314 points, or 1.2% \u2014 partly on diminishing hopes for an end to the trade war.\n\n\"Given the current level of hostility (and) distrust between the two sides, the possibility of negotiating a durable and broad deal seems quite remote,\" said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist who formerly led the China division at the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe Trump administration last year accused China of using predatory tactics in its drive to develop global competitors in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and electric cars. The administration alleges, and many China analysts agree, that these tactics include stealing sensitive technology and forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets.\n\nTrump has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese goods and plans to tax an additional $160 billion of imports on Dec. 15. This would extend U.S. tariffs to just about everything China ships to the United States.\n\n\"The U.S. has made very clear to China what sort of changes they need to make,\" said Stephen Vaughn, a partner at the King & Spalding law firm and former general counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Trump. \"Our president is prepared to make a deal. But it's got to be a deal that makes sense to us.\"\n\nInstead of yielding, China so far has counterpunched by taxing $120 billion in U.S. exports, notably soybeans and other farm goods that are critically important to Trump supporters in rural America.\n\nAs the trade war has dragged on for 15 months, economic damage has been inflicted on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nThe Chinese economy this year is expected to register its slowest growth since 1990.\n\nIn the United States, already struggling manufacturers are suffering from the higher costs that Trump's tariffs have imposed on components from China and are paralyzed by uncertainty over whether, when and how the trade hostilities might end.\n\nA private survey last week found that U.S. manufacturing output fell for a second straight month in September, reaching its lowest level since the recession year 2009.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the White House's top economic adviser, sounded an optimistic note as Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin prepared for two days of meetings with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He.\n\n\"Recently some of the statements coming out of Beijing have been a little more positive,\" Kudlow said on the Fox News Channel. \"They've been in the market buying some agriculture commodities from the U.S. \u2014 soybeans, pork, and wheat and other things. That's a good sign. The mood music \u2014 the psychology \u2014 seems to be a little better, so let's see what they come up with.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping have plenty of reasons to call off their trade war.
