Junior was born around 1995, meaning he preceded Dolly the cloned sheep by a year or so. This is the perfect time period to pinpoint as the birth of Will Smith (or at least a Will Smith) because it corresponds almost exactly with Smith\u2019s ascent into movie stardom: Bad Boys came out in 1995, followed by Independence Day in 1996. This is also the approximate time period that actually birthed Gemini Man, a script that\u2019s been kicking around Hollywood for well over 20 years, at one point as a possible vehicle for late director Tony Scott.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that plenty of Gemini Man feels like a slightly musty cable-replay staple, with that 1990s Jerry Bruckheimer military jocularity and a loving reverence for its lead actor\u2019s movie-star face. But it\u2019s also directed by Ang Lee, still trying out the 120-frames-per-second cinematography that gives 3D extra clarity. Lee played with 3D in the Oscar-winning Life of Pi, then added a high frame rate for the interesting but decidedly not-Oscar-winning Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk. In Gemini Man, he tries to balance one more technological breakthrough with the digital de-aging process that lets Smith play opposite his younger self. Applying this cutting-edge tech and some of Lee\u2019s earnest sensitivity to a junky popcorn film yields simultaneously futuristic and deeply, strangely retro results.\n\nGemini Man\u2019s time-warped weirdness is appropriate to Will Smith\u2019s blockbuster career; he makes a lot of high-tech science fiction movies, but he always seems to keep one foot in the past. Independence Day is as much a 1970s disaster-movie throwback as an alien invasion picture. I, Robot turned a seminal science fiction text into a generic cop action thriller. Even the snappy Men in Black is largely a streamlined Ghostbusters riff. On top of all that, Smith famously turned down the forward-thinking futurist classic The Matrix and wound up doing a different, vastly less iconic 1999 science fiction / action picture instead: Wild Wild West.\n\nTwenty years ago, Wild Wild West was considered Smith\u2019s first major financial and critical misfire. Though these days, a movie star getting his critically reviled project over $100 million single-handedly would seem pretty impressive. Gemini Man is a better movie in many ways, but it still has an odd kinship with Smith\u2019s most notorious (though far from worst) big-budget endeavor. Wild Wild West certainly wasn\u2019t an equivalent technological marvel in its day. Even in 1999, its green-screen effects were dodgy, and its massive computer-animated mechanical spider was unconvincing. From its clunky special effects to its steampunk-Western aesthetic to its TV source material to its employment of Kenneth Branagh as a legless Confederate general, almost nothing about Wild Wild West could be called influential. On the contrary, it felt like a sign that the 1990s\u2019 favorite formulas \u2014 big movie stars and formerly popular brand names \u2014 were no longer luring in audiences. Compared to scrappier 1999 hits like The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, or American Pie, even the quirkier aspects of Wild Wild West felt bloated and outmoded.\n\nYet Wild Wild West\u2019s magical thinking about the power of intellectual property is basically gospel in contemporary Hollywood. It\u2019s part of what makes a movie like Gemini Man feel like more of an outlier in 2019. Even Smith, who for years logged non-franchise hits, has acquiesced to this reality. His biggest recent movies plug him into gigantic IP like DC Comics and Disney animation. Suicide Squad and Aladdin share a mishmash-y quality (and disreputable entertainment value) with Wild Wild West, which turned out to be prescient about the quantity-over-quality approach to simulated mirth.\n\nGemini Man isn\u2019t a mishmash \u2014 tonally, it\u2019s more Enemy of the State than Wild Wild West \u2014 but it shares a different kinship with Wild Wild West, enough to raise the question of whether it will also leave its own accidental mark on Smith\u2019s career. Both Gemini Man and Wild Wild West are star vehicles made weirder by their deviation from Smith\u2019s usual levels of assembly line polish. While Wild Wild West lacked the snazzy Men in Black sheen, the high frame rate in Gemini Man is like an overabundance of polish: the movie gleams with an uncanny, sometimes discomfiting vividness that recalls a live broadcast blown up to impossible sizes.\n\nUltra-high frame rates are a fascinating way to capture a big star, displaying so much facial detail that close-ups become unusually detailed and piercing. Lee understands this, and pays a lot of attention to his faces, both real and digital, often holding his close-ups a beat or two longer than standard cinematic language would dictate. The movie\u2019s many settings often appear curiously de-populated, exacerbating Henry\u2019s sense of loneliness, and emphasizing the way Smith\u2019s faces become the vividly rendered suns the rest of the film orbits around.\n\nYet as prominent as Smith\u2019s faces are, the film doesn\u2019t play as a commentary on Smith\u2019s classic persona. It would be easy enough to have Henry\u2019s clone wisecrack his way through the action to signify carefree youth, but the clone, raised to be a super-soldier, has the social inexperience of a kid (his room is filled with model kits) and the creeping soul-sickness of a practiced killer. This is a compellingly odd use of digital de-aging technology, reproducing a younger Smith without many of his star-making trademarks.\n\nMeanwhile, the older Smith subdues his charm without erasing it. Henry says he\u2019s starting to have trouble looking at himself in the mirror, but Smith wears that self-doubt lightly, as if he\u2019s wary of bothering anyone with his \u201cghosts,\u201d as he calls them. He\u2019s good in the film, in both roles, though the best moments are the action sequences. They merge Lee\u2019s patient, painterly sensibilities with his technology\u2019s hyper-real intensity. And projected at 120 fps, they look like nothing else at the movies right now.\n\nThe fact that the 120 fps project is only available in select cities is a sign that this technology, beloved by Ang Lee, Peter Jackson, and seemingly not many others, may not catch on. And the fact that de-aging technology is also used this fall in an awards-caliber movie like The Irishman indicates that Gemini Man won\u2019t be remembered as a creative breakthrough on that front, either.\n\nBut the movie may have a life as a star study or even a blueprint for the ways that star power can be adjusted like a special effect. For de-aging effects to make sense at all, they must involve the deeply familiar faces of stars; otherwise, there\u2019s no reason not to simply cast a younger actor. (As much as some of us may love, say, Scoot McNairy, it would not be particularly thrilling to see him realistically portray a 22-year-old.) Gemini Man has an old-school respect for Smith\u2019s star power but a futuristic sense of how it might be modulated with cutting-edge technology. So much of the movie depends on quiet reminders of Smith\u2019s charisma, rather than a full-on charm offensive.\n\nThe \u201cyoung\u201d Will Smith has an uncanny effect, but it would arguably be weirder to see a computer-generated version of his old shtick, performed by the actor in middle age. This kind of virtual agility, providing something familiar (young Will Smith) and something new (playing an uncharacteristically somber role) may become a necessity for stars hoping to stay in the blockbuster game, especially if they want to manage their own brands without submitting to superheroics or Disney remakes.\n\nWhether Gemini Man\u2019s most interesting aspects ultimately give it a better reputation than Wild Wild West, this is clearly not Will Smith\u2019s second shot at The Matrix. But as celebrated as that movie still is (with a legacy sequel in the works), the sleek, mind-bending stylishness of The Matrix feels less like a dominant blockbuster aesthetic than the sweaty, overspending, intermittent charm of Wild Wild West. (For that matter, the latter beats that Smith-less fourth Men in Black movie any day.) Gemini Man may appear misbegotten and outmoded now. Just don\u2019t be surprised if once the technology that went into it has had time to settle, it beats the odds and winds up looking like the future.", "description": "Ang Lee\u2019s new movie Gemini Man stars Will Smith both as a hunted assassin and as the digitally de-aged younger clone hunting him. It\u2019s from a 20-year-old screenplay, and it feels like a throwback to an earlier era of Jerry Bruckheimer blockbusters. But its specific way of dealing with Smith\u2019s star power as a digital asset may be a model for future films.", "authors": ["Jesse Hassenger", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zga9pv6UIdTz3-UKR3tdW0wdw8=/0x0:6000x3141/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19293027/gm07584r.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
