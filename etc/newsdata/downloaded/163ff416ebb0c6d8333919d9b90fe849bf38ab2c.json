(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThe president is calling McGahn a liar, and it looks as if a lot of people will throw the former White House counsel under the bus.\n\nSo Don McGahn is in the president\u2019s crosshairs. Whose side are you on?\n\nI ask because this is perhaps the perfect test for a special subgroup of Donald Trump supporters. Call them the \u201cBut Gorsuchers.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the Trump administration, when things got off to a rocky start, the go-to response from many Trump boosters was some version of \u201cYes, but we got Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.\u201d As things got more chaotic, it became a joke to say, \u201cYeah, but Gorsuch\u201d after every embarrassing revelation or disturbing tweet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut from a conservative perspective that places a high priority on the court, this was an utterly defensible point of view. Many Republicans who were reluctant to vote for Trump came around only after he promised to pick judges exclusively from a list vetted by the conservative Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. This reassured the voters who had taken Trump seriously when he talked about putting his sister on the Supreme Court.\n\nIf the opportunity to put a conservative on the court \u2014 or deny Hillary Clinton a chance to do so \u2014 was why you ultimately voted for him, then \u201cBut Gorsuch\u201d was a fair retort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t hear \u201cBut Gorsuch\u201d often these days, for two reasons. The first is entirely to Trump\u2019s credit \u2014 again from a certain Republican or conservative perspective. Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, too. Scores of excellent judges have been appointed to the lower courts. We\u2019ve seen tax cuts, deregulation, the partial dismantling of Obamacare, and a number of other conservative accomplishments on Trump\u2019s watch. His supporters \u2014 reluctant and wholehearted alike \u2014 have every reason to count these things in the \u201cpro\u201d column.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s the second reason, which is less favorable to Trump. Whether you call it the party line, right-wing political correctness, or simply a desire to cater to the president\u2019s fragile ego, it\u2019s simply not acceptable to publicly criticize Trump on the right. Prominent religious leaders feel compelled to dismiss Trump\u2019s sordid sexual history. Passionate constitutionalists simply shrug or celebrate Trump\u2019s words and deeds, no matter how contrary they may be to constitutional principles. You have to gush about his genius when there\u2019s little discernible wisdom in what he does, and you must marvel at his courage when there\u2019s none to be seen. Credit for Trump\u2019s wins is all his; blame for his losses is all somebody else\u2019s.\n\nThe \u201cBut Gorsuch\u201d argument is also known as the transactional case for Trump. You don\u2019t have to like or approve of what he does, but it\u2019s worth putting up with because of the results. This is what you hear when you talk to Republican politicians and many prominent conservative activists and donors in private. But when was the last time you heard it on TV or talk radio?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, the demand that everyone see the emperor\u2019s new clothes is so powerful that criticizing \u2014 or even being inconvenient to \u2014 the president\u2019s preferred messaging is seen not only as a kind of treason but as proof that the critic isn\u2019t really a conservative at all.\n\nWhich brings me to McGahn, who until recently was considered a widely respected, unimpeachably conservative lawyer. I have no idea what the former White House counsel\u2019s personal views on Trump are. But based on his actions, he was at minimum a conservative transactionalist. He didn\u2019t attack the president; he joined Trump\u2019s team. It was McGahn\u2019s job to shepherd Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and other judges through the confirmation process. By the time McGahn left the White House last year, not only had he scored two Supreme Court victories for the president, he\u2019d been a sherpa to 59 other federal judgeships.\n\nAlso, according to the Mueller report, McGahn may well have saved the Trump presidency by refusing to follow the president\u2019s orders to derail the Mueller probe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcGahn cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. He didn\u2019t want to; he was told to by Trump and his legal team.\n\nNow, Trump is calling McGahn a liar. The president denies he told McGahn to fire Mueller. Trump and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have insinuated that McGahn\u2019s handwritten notes from his conversations with the president are somehow fraudulent.\n\nWe\u2019ll see how things unfold, but it looks as if a lot of people, when forced to choose, will opt to throw McGahn under the bus, because loyalty to the president is now the definition of what it means to be a Republican or a conservative. And saying \u201cBut Gorsuch\u201d won\u2019t help McGahn.\n\n(C) 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY, LLC", "description": "The president is calling McGahn a liar, and it looks as if a lot of people will throw the former White House counsel under the bus.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
