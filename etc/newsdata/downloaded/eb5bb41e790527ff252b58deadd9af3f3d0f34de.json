That field in Huambo is now a busy street. The southern African nation is now years past a grinding civil war and hopes to be land mine-free by 2025.\n\n\u201cLand mines are an unhealed scar of war,\u201d Prince Harry said in the town of Dirico. \u201cBy clearing the land mines we can help this community find peace, and with peace comes opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe Angola country director for mine-clearing organization The HALO Trust said Diana\u2019s visit is still very much discussed today in Huambo after people were struck by her warmth and willingness to acknowledge their devastating 27-year conflict.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She was a great advocate for a land mine ban, and \u201cher willingness to visit an actual mine field, to place herself right in that context, provided great impetus and gave it a great boost.\u201d\n\nThe international ban on anti-personnel mines was signed that year and entered into force two years later. So far 164 countries have signed on. \u201cMore than 48 million stockpiled mines have been destroyed and 31 countries have been completely cleared of land mines,\u201d The HALO Trust said, while production of the weapons has almost dried up.\n\nPrince Harry on his visit also remotely detonated a mine, met with mine-clearing teams and was visiting the orthopedic hospital his mother visited for her meetings with mine victims.\n\n\u201cI think that will be a very poignant moment of coming full circle,\u201d Legg said. \u201cVery striking once people compare those images from the two visits to see how far Angola has come.\u201d\n\nThe world, however, is hardly free of mines, and Legg said Angola itself still has about 650 mine fields left to clear. Some countries that remain heavily mined include Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen.\n\nAngola now hopes to turn some of its mine-free areas into sites for wildlife conservation and ecotourism. The prince will unveil a project meant to protect wildlife corridors near the sprawling Okavango Delta, a rare inland delta in neighboring Botswana that doesn\u2019t flow into a sea or ocean and is home to several endangered species.\n\nHarry\u2019s first official family tour with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their baby, Archie, will continue with stops in Malawi and further events in South Africa with a focus on issues including mental health and women\u2019s empowerment.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Princess Diana's 1997 walk through an active mine field in Angola helped to lead to a global ban on the deadly weapons", "authors": ["Cara Anna"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/harry-diana-angola-mine-field-walk.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
