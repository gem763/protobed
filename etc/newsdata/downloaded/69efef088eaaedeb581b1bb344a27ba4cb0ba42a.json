It's meant to help alleviate stress, but in a world where education has been set up as a competition, it's often a mixed signal.\n\nStudents are worried, and have many valid reasons to be. Instead of telling them not to worry, listen to their concerns and help correct misunderstandings.\n\nHelp them work through different options, and guide them towards the support they need.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nI was moderating a panel recently that was meant to give high school students advice before they go off to college. Almost all of the panelists gave tips that boiled down to, \"Don't worry.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about choosing your major. You won't even use it in your job.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about graduating on a set timetable. Go at your own pace.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about going to the right college, because where you go doesn't matter as much as you think.\"\n\nI understand the intention behind that advice \u2014 young people are stressed out about what they'll have to do to succeed in life, so \"don't worry\" is simply a well-meaning attempt to ease students' anxiety. The problem is, most students have been taught to focus on achievement since childhood. High test scores, a 4.0 GPA, AP classes, and accelerated \"math lanes\" have prepped them to view their education as a competition.\n\nBut when students are suddenly told, \"Oh, don't worry. It doesn't really matter. You can go at your own pace,\" they feel like they're getting mixed signals.\n\nThey're confused \u2014 and develop even more anxiety. In fact, almost every student came up to me after that panel and said they felt more stressed. Their concerns about college weren't alleviated or acknowledged.\n\nStudents know that college is ridiculously expensive, and it doesn't guarantee a job that will help them pay off loans after graduation. They're worried, and they have every reason to be.", "description": "Students are often worried about the future \u2014 and they have many reasons to be.
