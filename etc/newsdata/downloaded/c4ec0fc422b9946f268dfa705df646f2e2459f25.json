Recently there has been an onslaught of media coverage about him hitting back at trolls, or about viewers complaining that he\u2019s \u2018ruining\u2019 their favourite shows.\n\nAnd judging by the sheer hysteria in the replies to the Strictly Twitter account after his first It Takes Two episode, you\u2019d think he\u2019d set fire to the stage and locked Zoe Ball in a sequinned dungeon.\n\nWell I\u2019m sorry, but if liking Rylan is wrong, then frankly I don\u2019t want to be right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been this way, though. Initially I was far from a Rylan stan.\n\nFlash your minds back to 7 October 2012. Almost exactly seven years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s the first live results show of The X Factor\u2019s ninth season. Christopher Maloney, Ella Henderson, James Arthur, Union J and Jahmene Douglas are all through to next week. Rylan is in the bottom two with Carolynne Poole.\n\nIt was tough to take him too seriously at first (Picture: ITV Picture Desk) Nicole Scherzinger, his mentor, saves him. Gary Barlow, Carolynne\u2019s mentor, saves her \u2013 making a handful of needlessly spiteful remarks at Rylan\u2019s expense. Tulisa votes the same way, but does so nicely.\n\nThen it gets to Louis Walsh. Oh boy. It\u2019s one of the most iconic results show controversies in X Factor history (Lucie Jones vs Jedward? Forget it!) as he flaps around for what feels like eight and a half years and even appears to change his mind once or twice before finally sending home Carolynne. It\u2019s a tie. Two votes each. We\u2019re in deadlock.\n\nGary\u2019s on his feet; he\u2019s going to pass out from the rage. Poor Carolynne just wants to be put out of her misery. The crowd are absolutely beside themselves. And finally Dermot O\u2019Leary reveals it was Carolynne who polled the fewest votes from the viewers. Rylan stays \u2013 and becomes public enemy number one.\n\nLike a lot of viewers at the time, I was fuming. Fuming! See, I took that show very seriously back then: Once my brother put up a wall chart for the football World Cup in the family kitchen and I incredulously asked what would happen if I put up a wall chart for The X Factor live shows. He laughed. I wasn\u2019t joking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I took it so seriously, I was never a fan of the contestants who were (arguably) there more for the sake of creating an entertaining TV show than finding a viable pop star. And though Rylan certainly wasn\u2019t in the same ballpark as Wagner and Honey G, it also didn\u2019t feel like he was on the cusp of international music superstardom.\n\nBut despite all the controversy, he was consistently voted for by the public. His popularity was growing. There was a self-awareness about him; the sense that he was taking his performances seriously \u2013 but he wasn\u2019t taking himself seriously at the same time. He also realised that the best way to overcome Gary Barlow was to (lightly) rib him back; and in an otherwise very serious year (James Arthur and Christopher Maloney hardly scream \u2018club night\u2019, do they), he was the only one who brought the fun.\n\nI, like millions of others, really warmed to him. He made it to the final five, was on Celebrity Big Brother within weeks, landed a co-hosting gig on Big Brother\u2019s Bit On The Side, and the rest is history.\n\nHis initial forays into TV presenting weren\u2019t perfect, and given the amount of reality stars who land those sorts of jobs on a short term basis, it was tough to take him too seriously at first.\n\nHosting is way harder than it looks \u2013 especially when it\u2019s live (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nBut as time went on, it became obvious that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. His natural warmth and humour made him a skilled host, and slowly more projects began to stack up. Now, it seems, he is inescapable; and along the way, he\u2019s become one of the best (and most in-demand) TV personalities in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, despite all the love (and make no mistake, he is very popular), not everyone is happy about his recent domination.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s annoying!\u2019 cry some people. \u2018He makes me feel sick!\u2019 tweet others. He\u2019s a \u2018talentless waste of space trying to be the centre of attention,\u2019 moaned one Twitter user who perhaps hasn\u2019t had a nice cuddle in a good few years.\n\nI don\u2019t get it \u2013 Rylan\u2019s a natural. If Olly Murs fronting The X Factor in 2015 taught us anything, it\u2019s that hosting is way harder than it looks \u2013 especially when it\u2019s live.\n\nThat the likes of Emma Willis, Ant and Dec, Ore Oduba and Phil and Holly are able to make it look easy is a testament to their skill, and Rylan is similarly effortless. He always seems in control, he has a sincerity that never boils over into forced earnestness\u2026 Heck, he has a sense of humour!\n\nI worry that some of the pushback he gets is rooted in veiled classism and homophobia. When certain snobby people hear a strong Essex accent, they immediately think \u2018annoying\u2019; and when they see a gay man showing exuberance and passion, femme-shaming is sure to follow (remember when Jonathan Van Ness had to call out a BuzzFeed quiz for suggesting his personality \u2018might not be for everyone\u2019?). I saw one tweet saying \u2018ditch the diva\u2019 which is\u2026 well, it\u2019s certainly telling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been seven years since Rylan became a household name. And \u2013 like fellow telly-contestant-turned-host Alison Hammond \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t have stayed the course if he didn\u2019t deserve it.\n\nThrough hard work, kindness and sheer determination, he has become one of the best people on British television.\n\nLong may his reign continue.\n\nMORE: I never thought I\u2019d agree with Piers Morgan but he\u2019s right about Strictly same-sex pairings\n\nMORE: Why do people hate vegans?\n\nMORE: When you have a Bake Off disaster, the GBBO tent is a lonely place", "description": "Rylan Clark-Neal entered the public eye seven years ago - it's time he gets the recognition he deserves, argues Shaun Kitchener.", "authors": ["Shaun Kitchener", "Screenwriter", "Playwright", "Entertainment Journalist"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18818085-low_res-it-takes-two-2019-a819-e1569672306542_1570015938.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
