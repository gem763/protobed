From American Pastoral to Life, Itself, the TIFF bomb has a hallowed legacy among Oscar-watchers as a would-be awards vehicle whose ambitions do not survive first contact with actual North American moviegoers. One of them was surely lurking in this year\u2019s lineup. What would it be?\n\nHalfway through the festival, TIFF seems to have picked this year\u2019s catastrophe: The Goldfinch, John Crowley\u2019s adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel. The film was one of the crown jewels of this year\u2019s lineup, and after its world premiere Sunday night, the film has been treated to even more scathing reviews than Jojo Rabbit. Collider called it \u201cextremely long and incredibly gross.\u201d Indiewire called it a \u201cstately, lugubrious mess.\u201d These and other, less dismissive reactions were then collected by Jezebel, which announced \u201cEveryone already hates The Goldfinch.\u201d Now, that pendulum has swung back to Toronto: In the press lounge Tuesday afternoon, a few journalists mentioned that they\u2019d dropped the film from their schedules as swiftly as they\u2019d once dropped Life, Itself.\n\nBut the thing is, I didn\u2019t hate The Goldfinch! In fact, I didn\u2019t hate The Goldfinch so much that I now feel mildly compelled to defend it. The first misconception I must dispel concerns the booing. The Jezebel post mentions the film debuted to \u201ca warm round of boos, \u201d which has been picked up by outsiders to mean that the notoriously nice Toronto audience suddenly turned into those jackals at Cannes. However, that reference to booing appears to be metaphorical \u2014 I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that the film was booed during its official premiere, and it certainly wasn\u2019t booed during the critics\u2019 screening I attended earlier in the festival. Did my co-attendees that night leave the theater muttering under their breaths about how the movie was an utter piece of shit? Yes, they did. But did they actually boo? No, they did not.\n\nThe second misconception I must address is that the film is a lifeless bore. That\u2019s admittedly a matter of taste, but for most of The Goldfinch, I found much to occupy my attention. When people call a movie \u201chandsome,\u201d this is the kind of movie they\u2019re talking about. The Goldfinch takes place in rarefied spaces \u2014 a luxurious Upper East Side apartment, an eclectic antiques store in the West Village, a deserted, post-crash version of exurban Las Vegas. Spending time in these places is no substitute for fascinating characters or a crackling plot, but it\u2019s not nothing, either. I spent my whole screening fantasizing about acquiring Jeffrey Wright\u2019s character\u2019s entire wardrobe, and I could think of worse ways to spend two hours.\n\nThe third misconception I must dispute concerns the acting. Ever since he broke out with The Fault in Our Stars, Ansel Elgort has been the subject of one frequent criticism: that he seems, in the immortal words of my former colleague Margaret Lyons, \u201clike a chode.\u201d There are some young male stars you actually lose sympathy for the more you see of them, and no question, Elgort is one. (Shia LaBeouf circa 2010 was another.) However, I venture that this actually makes The Goldfinch work better! As an orphan with a tragic past who\u2019s grown into a shady antiques dealer, Elgort\u2019s Theo is supposed to be slightly smug and insufferable. Wanting to punch him in the face is the whole point. And, I venture, many of the supporting performers are legitimately good. Wright and Nicole Kidman are playing roles they\u2019ve played many times before \u2014 avuncular mentor and genteel surrogate mother, respectively \u2014 but they inhabit each part with genuine warmth. And in a tiny, slimy cameo, Denis O\u2019Hare gets another chance to show why he\u2019s one of our top character actors.\n\nThe fourth and final misconception I need to mention is that the film\u2019s editing is a total mess, and here I can only say that this is not a misconception at all. The editing is genuinely baffling: Rather than simply proceeding in chronological order, or flashing back regularly between past and present, the film attempts to mimic Tartt\u2019s time-jumping structure, which doesn\u2019t work at all. We\u2019ll be in the present for 15 minutes, the past for the rest of the first act, back in the present for two scenes, then again in the past for 45 minutes. For a few minutes I was convinced poor Finn Wolfhard\u2019s Boris had been cut from the film entirely, but nope, we just had to spend some completely random time with Ansel before we could get to him. And we haven\u2019t even gotten to the film\u2019s incredibly rushed climax, where you can practically hear the first AD saying \u201cgotta wrap it up, gotta wrap it up\u201d from offscreen.\n\nBut even this haphazard editing isn\u2019t enough to make the film a disaster. In the end, I net out somewhere close to Vanity Fair\u2019s Richard Lawson, who wrote that he \u201cleft the film appreciative of its style and strong performances, but not emotionally altered in any lingering way.\u201d If I was feeling uncharitable, I could mention that many of the film\u2019s detractors seem to share a certain type of cinephile\u2019s disdain for the sumptuous, the literary, the feminine. But I\u2019m not! So instead I\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s a shame to dub The Goldfinch this year\u2019s disaster when there are still so many more contenders waiting in the wings. There\u2019s one biopic set to screen that I\u2019ve heard is particularly horrid. I can\u2019t wait to see it.", "description": "Halfway through the Toronto International Film Festival, critics seem to have picked this year\u2019s catastrophe: The Goldfinch.
