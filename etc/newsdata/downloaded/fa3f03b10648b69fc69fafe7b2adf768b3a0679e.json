Apple will let you trade in your iPhone XR in good working condition for up to $370 if you want the iPhone 11, bringing the iPhone 11\u2019s price tag down to $330. You\u2019ll have to gauge whether its extra features are worth $330 on top of what you paid for the iPhone XR in 2018.\n\nHere are the most important things to consider when choosing between the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11:\n\nBattery: The iPhone 11 lasts up to one hour longer than the iPhone XR.\n\nsource Apple\n\nApple doesn\u2019t list battery sizes, but according to GSM Arena, the iPhone 11\u2019s battery is slightly bigger, at 3,110 mAh, than the iPhone XR\u2019s 2,942-mAh battery.\n\nScreen: The iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 have the same screen \u2014 same 6.1-inch size, same 828p resolution, same bezels, same everything.\n\nsource Apple\n\nDesign, size, and weight: The iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 are exactly the same size and weight. They look identical, except for the iPhone 11\u2019s rear camera system.\n\nsource Apple\n\nPower: The iPhone 11 runs on Apple\u2019s new A13 chip, while the iPhone XR runs on last year\u2019s A12 chip. The A12 might be older, but it\u2019s no slouch.\n\nsource Apple/YouTube\n\nThe iPhone XR runs on Apple\u2019s 2018 A12 chip with 3 GB of RAM, while the iPhone 11 runs on 2019\u2019s A13 chip with 4 GB of RAM. (Apple doesn\u2019t list how much RAM each phone has, so the RAM number is according to GSM Arena.)\n\nIt\u2019s tough to gauge the difference that the iPhone 11\u2019s specs will make. New iPhones are always more powerful and faster than older iPhones, but the performance gap between the old and new is narrowing more and more every year.\n\nFace ID: Apple says Face ID on the iPhone 11 is 30% faster than the previous generation, including the iPhone XR.\n\nsource Apple\n\nRear cameras: The iPhone XR has a single-lens 12-megapixel camera, and the iPhone 11 has a 12-megapixel dual-lens camera system.

The iPhone XR can do only 5x digital zoom. Digital zoom is artificial and not as good as natural optical zoom.\n\nThe iPhone 11 can take portrait-mode photos of pets and objects, while the iPhone XR can take portrait shots only of people.\n\nThe iPhone 11\u2019s portrait mode has Apple\u2019s lighting effects, like studio, stage, and high-key mono. The iPhone XR\u2019s portrait mode doesn\u2019t have those effects.\n\nThe iPhone 11 has Apple\u2019s new night mode for better low-light shots.\n\nThe iPhone 11 has Apple\u2019s \u201cnext-generation\u201d smart HDR for photos, which Apple says is better than the iPhone XR\u2019s smart HDR.\n\nSource: Apple, and a photo taken with the iPhone 11\u2019s ultrawide camera\n\nSelfie camera: The iPhone XR has a 7-megapixel selfie camera, while the iPhone 11 has a 12-megapixel selfie camera.

It also supports WiFi 6.\n\nsource Apple\n\nApple says you can download things up to 38% faster on WiFi 6 \u2013 but you\u2019d need a WiFi 6 router and the internet speeds to take full advantage of WiFi 6.\n\nAirDrop: iPhone 11 has an improved AirDrop function, powered by Apple\u2019s new U1 chip, letting you AirDrop things more easily when you\u2019re pointing the iPhone 11 toward other Apple devices with the chip.", "description": "Business Insider - For $100 more, the iPhone 11 offers a few things you might want to consider before buying the iPhone XR..
