The loan was put on hold last week, after the Italia Nostra group had argued that the sketch was too fragile to be transported to France, where a major exhibition about Leonardo will open on October 24, in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the artist's death.\n\nThe group launched an appeal with a court in Veneto, home region to the city of Venice and its Gallerie dell'Accademia, the institution that owns the drawing. That appeal was rejected on Wednesday.\n\n\"Vitruvian Man\" is rarely displayed because light exposure can damage the 500-year-old paper sketch. As a result, it is exhibited only every few years. The last time it was visible to the public was last summer, when a Leonardo show centered around it was launched at Gallerie dell'Accademia.\n\n\"Vitruvian Man\" (1490) a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, on show in Venice, in 2013.
