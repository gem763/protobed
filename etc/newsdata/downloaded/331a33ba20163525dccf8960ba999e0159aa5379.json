It was quickly followed by two further blackface pictures\n\nMr Trudeau also brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change but rescued a stalled pipeline expansion project to get Alberta's oil to international markets.\n\nHe also negotiated a new free trade deal for Canada with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by President Donald Trump to scrap it.\n\nSensing trouble for Mr Trudeau, former U.S. President Barack Obama chimed in with an unusual endorsement to back the Liberal leader for re-election.\n\nAt final campaign stops in British Columbia on Sunday, Mr Trudeau called for a 'strong, progressive government that will unite Canadians and fight climate change'.\n\nHis challenger Mr Scheer, 40, is a career politician described as bland even by some of his own party colleagues.\n\nHowever, his allies hope his prudent, minivan-driving dad persona will appeal to Canadians weary of Mr Trudeau.\n\nThe Conservative leader calls Mr Trudeau a phony who can not even recall how many times he has worn blackface.\n\nCanadians 'cannot afford' a Liberal government propped up by the third-place New Democrats, Mr Scheer said at the end of a marathon last push from coast to coast.\n\nElection battle: Justin Trudeau (pictured at a fire station in Hamilton, Ontario on Saturday) may be forced to negotiate with smaller parties or turfed out of power altogether\n\nRival: Andrew Scheer's allies hope his prudent, minivan-driving dad persona will appeal to Canadians weary of Mr Trudeau\n\n'We can only imagine what the NDP's price would be to keep Justin Trudeau in power,' he said.\n\n'Whatever it is, we know Trudeau would pay any price to stay in power and he'd use your money to do it.'\n\nJason Kenney, Alberta's premier and a close friend of Mr Scheer, has called the Conservative leader 'an extremely normal Canadian' who is so nice he 'can't fake being mean'.\n\nMr Scheer, however, has so relentlessly attacked Mr Trudeau that Nik Nanos, a Canadian pollster, said he has not been himself.\n\n'Scheer has been hostage to the message,' Mr Nanos said. 'His campaign has made him into an attack machine.'\n\nMr Scheer has found himself on the back foot late in the campaign over revelations of his American dual citizenship.\n\nThere ave also been allegations that his party hired a communications firm to 'destroy' the upstart People's Party, led by former Conservative foreign minister Maxime Bernier.\n\nMr Trudeau has accused the Conservatives of running one of the 'dirtiest, nastiest' election campaigns.\n\nEndorsement: Mr Trudeau's campaign received backing from former U.S. President Barack Obama (pictured together in November 2016)\n\nBacking: Former President Obama chimed in on Twitter to offer his support to his former counterpart in an unusual intervention\n\nThe nation's top bureaucrat earlier this year warned that public discourse had fallen to such a low level that he 'worried that somebody is going to be shot... during the political campaign.'\n\nAt one rally, Mr Trudeau was forced to wear a bulletproof vest.\n\nAt a rally on Saturday there were chants of 'lock him up' when Mr Scheer said he would investigate the attorney general row - echoing the chant used by Trump supporters against Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, Mr Scheer moved to calm the crown and changed the chant to 'Vote him out'.\n\nMr Scheer is also promising to end the carbon tax and cut government spending, including foreign aid, by 25 per cent.\n\n'That money belongs to you, not to them,' Mr Scheer said.\n\nBecause of Canada's extreme size, the largest electoral district, Nunavut, is several times larger than the UK.\n\nPreliminary results across six time zones are expected shortly after 7pm Ottawa time (7pm on the U.S. East Coast, midnight in Britain).", "description": "Justin Trudeau (pictured in Ontario) and his Liberal party, who came to power in 2015, are now neck-and-neck with the Conservatives in opinion polls and predicted to lose their majority.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/10/19984818-0-image-a-16_1571651866202.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
