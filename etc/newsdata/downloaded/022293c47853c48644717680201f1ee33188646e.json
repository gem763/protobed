Mr. Pearson, who is also on the union\u2019s executive board, also was charged with fraud and money laundering.\n\nMr. Pearson is the first sitting union official charged in the yearslong investigation, which had previously ensnared former union officials and executives at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and has since spread to the union\u2019s General Motors Co. department.\n\n\u201cWhile these allegations are very concerning, we strongly believe that the government has misconstrued any number of facts,\u201d the union said Thursday. \u201cWe will not let this distract us from the critical negotiations underway with GM.\u201d\n\nMr. Pearson couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for comment.\n\nLast month, federal agents also searched the homes of UAW President Gary Jones and his predecessor, Dennis Williams, marking a significant escalation of the investigation. Mr. Jones led the Region 5 office before he became president last year. The union has said it is cooperating with the investigation and that there was no need for the search warrants. Neither man has been charged with a crime.\n\nThe charges against Mr. Pearson come two days before the UAW\u2019s contracts with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler are set to expire. The union\u2019s top officials are negotiating first with GM. Union leaders from GM\u2019s factories across the country are expected to meet Sunday in Detroit for an update on the talks.\n\n\u201cGM is outraged and deeply concerned by the conduct of union officials as uncovered by the government\u2019s investigation,\u201d the company said Thursday. \u201cThese serious allegations represent a stunning abuse of power and trust.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s investigation has resulted in nine convictions, including a prison sentence for Fiat Chrysler\u2019s former head of labor relations.\n\nIn a federal criminal complaint, Mr. Pearson, 58 years old, is accused of conspiring with other union officials to conceal lavish personal expenses, paid for with union money, during UAW Region 5 conferences held in California and Missouri between 2014 and 2018.\n\nMr. Pearson led UAW\u2019s Region 5 office since June 2018, covering 17 states in the western and southwestern U.S. He was previously the office\u2019s assistant director under Mr. Jones, who hosted Region 5 conferences when he served as director.\n\nThe gatherings typically lasted about a week, but prosecutors allege Mr. Pearson and other unnamed UAW officials paid for weeks- or monthslong trips to Palm Springs, Calif., with union funds. Some $60,000 in UAW funds spent there were falsely represented as part of the conference, according to Mr. Pearson\u2019s charging document.\n\nA scandal that began with what federal prosecutors say was a conspiracy by Fiat Chrysler executives to keep UAW officials \u201cfat, dumb and happy\u201d has now ensnared a range of union officials. Former UAW Vice President Norwood Jewell, who as a top-ranking official led bargaining with Fiat Chrysler, was recently sentenced to 15 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to violating the Labor Management Relations Act. Prosecutors revealed in his sentencing memo that Mr. Jewell had used union training-center funds to rent private villas in Palm Springs.\n\nProsecutors say Mr. Pearson and other UAW leaders bought more than $100,000 worth of golf clubs, golf clothing, golf balls and other accessories at various pro shops in California and Missouri. Investigators also claim to have uncovered evidence of designer clothing, steak houses, spa visits, exotic sports cars and high-end shotguns paid for with funds designated for worker training.\n\nDuring the search warrant executed at Mr. Pearson\u2019s office and home in Missouri, agents found dozens of cigars, high-end bottles of liquor, and tens of thousands of dollars in cash, prosecutors said.", "description": "Vance Pearson, director of the UAW\u2019s Region 5 office in Missouri, was charged with embezzlement of union money in an expanding federal corruption investigation just as contract talks with auto makers pick up.", "authors": ["Nora Naughton", "Nora.Naughton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106699/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
