The CNN report indicates that the agent was removed at least in part over concerns that Mr Trump had mishandled classified information during an Oval Office meeting with then-Russian ambassador to the US Sergei Kislyak and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nThe information Mr Trump disclosed to the Russians was related to intelligence about Isis in Syria, and had been provided by Israel.\n\nWhile that intelligence was not directly related to the spy in the Russian government, the disclosure is nevertheless thought to have sparked a discussion among intelligence officials about potential exposure.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Mr Trump confiscated notes taken by an interpreter at the end of that meeting \u2013 an unusual action for a president, and one that suggests an added layer of secrecy.\n\nThere had been mounting concern over the safety of the asset, beginning at least at the end of the Obama administration when officials became concerned about the length of time the agent spent co-operating with the US.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
