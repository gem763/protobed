Uighur locals and activists have accused China of attempting to erase the ethnic minority\u2019s history and uproot them from their ancestral home.\n\nThe Communist Party has also built thousands of concentration camps in Xinjiang holding millions of Uighurs \u2013 and used the camps to excuse the replacement of private burials with \u201cburial management centers,\u201d arguing that they are necessary because not enough young men remain free from the concentration camps to help carry bodies and perform burial rites.\n\nSurvivors of the concentration camps say Beijing is subjecting Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz people, and other minorities to a host of human rights atrocities, including murder, rape, forced sterilization, and organ harvesting.\n\nThe use of government force to kill, sterilize, or rape a people out of existence fits the United Nations international legal definition of genocide.\n\nThe AFP\u2019s reporters visit 13 destroyed cemeteries in Xinjiang and reported finding human remains thoughtlessly strewn across the empty plots where tombs used to be. Local officials dismissed concerns about disrespecting the dead, denying that the bones were human (AFP scientific sources confirmed that bone fragments found did indeed belong to people). The news agency found evidence for the destruction of at least 45 Uighur cemeteries:\n\nIn Urumqi, the regional capital, a cemetery near the international airport was cleared to make way for an urban \u201creconstruction\u201d project. In Shayar, where the local government has built new cemeteries near some of the old sites, an official told AFP the program was aimed at \u201cstandardization.\u201d The rebuilt sites \u201csaved space, protected the ecosystem\u201d and were \u201ccivilized,\u201d it said. \u201cThe new cemeteries are standardised, clean, and they\u2019re convenient for residents,\u201d Kadier Kasimu, deputy director of Shayar\u2019s cultural affairs bureau, told AFP.\n\nUighur families are often buried in the same cemeteries for generations, meaning that the sites serve as historical milestones where individuals can come to study their genealogy and their culture. Uyghur Islamic tradition requires family the have the ability to clean the body, then offer it to family for prayers before ultimately burying the person with their ancestors.\n\nUighurs whose cemeteries have been destroyed told the AFP that they feel that the Communist Party has launched a campaign to erase them from the history of China. Far from Beijing, Uighur identity developed distinctly in Xinjiang and has little in common with the Han Chinese culture dominant in the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is all part of China\u2019s campaign to effectively eradicate any evidence of who we are, to effectively make us like the Han Chinese,\u201d Salih Hudayar, who lost the tombs of great-grandparents, told AFP. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re destroying all of these historical sites, these cemeteries, to disconnect us from our history, from our fathers and our ancestors.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you destroy that cemetery \u2026 you\u2019re uprooting whoever\u2019s on that land, whoever\u2019s connected to that land,\u201d Nurgul Sawut, another local, told AFP.\n\nThe destruction of Uighur graveyards is not new. The Print reported in July that the Communist Party began rapidly constructing \u201cburial management centers\u201d throughout the region after destroying at least three cemeteries in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. One was turned into an \u201cecological\u201d park; Chinese authorities have also used a green agenda as an excuse to eradicate Uighur holy sites.\n\nThe cemetery where the grave of one of the Uyghurs' most revered poets, Lutpulla Mutellip, once stood now looks like this. Big @AFP story shows that China's desecration of minority ethnicity graveyards is much more than widespread than previously known.https://t.co/QHNopsUAzz pic.twitter.com/j8axYlUqKx \u2014 Rian Thum (@RianThum) October 9, 2019\n\nIn Hotan, another major Xinjiang city, the Chinese regime razed a 1000-year-old cemetery holding the remains of several historic figures, including Muslim crusaders from the late second millennium who brought the religion to western China.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA), which has pioneered reporting on the destruction of Uighur identity in Xinjiang, began warning of authorities forcing Uighurs to use \u201cburial management centers\u201d instead of burying their loved ones privately in April 2018.\n\n\u201cRecent posts on a social media channel used by the mostly-Muslim Uyghur community included a photo of a notice informing residents of the construction of a center in Keriye (Yutian) county\u2019s Arish township to conduct the burial of local residents,\u201d the outlet noted then.\n\n\u201cThe a\u0131m of the Ch\u0131nese government \u0131s to suffocate us \u0131n every aspect of our daily l\u0131fe by restricting our cultural and rel\u0131g\u0131ous trad\u0131t\u0131ons, which often leads people to rebel\u2014and that g\u0131ves the authorities a leg\u0131t\u0131mate reason to respond with deadly force,\u201d Zumret, identified as a Uyghur political analyst, told RFA at the time. \u201cThe Ch\u0131nese have burial management centers from where corpses are sent for cremation before be\u0131ng bur\u0131ed, and this is the type of procedure the Ch\u0131nese government wants the Uyghurs to adhere to.\u201d\n\nBy June of that year, RFA was warning of the Communist Party \u201crapidly constructing crematoria\u201d not just to force Uighurs to abandon their cultural traditions, but to hide the evidence of the mass murder of Uighurs and other minorities in concentration camps.
