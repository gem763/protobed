But that\u2019s not enough for EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who said in a 2016 ruling that Apple\u2019s tax deals with Ireland allowed the company to pay far less than other businesses. The court must now weigh whether regulators were right to levy a record \u20ac13bn (\u00a311.6bn) tax bill.\n\nApple\u2019s haggling over tax comes after its market valuation hit $1 trillion last week on the back of a new aggressive pricing strategy that may stoke demand for some smartphones and watches. The company\u2019s huge revenue \u2014 and those of other technology firms \u2014 have attracted close scrutiny in Europe, focusing on complicated company structures for transferring profits generated from intellectual property.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

She\u2019s also been tasked with coming up with a \u201cfair European tax\u201d by the end of 2020 if global efforts to reform digital taxation don\u2019t make progress.\n\n\u201cPolitically, this will have very big consequences,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a Green member of the European Parliament. \u201cIf Apple wins this case, the calls for tax harmonisation in Europe will take on a different dynamic, you can count on that.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The move addresses criticism by the same court handling the Apple challenge. A February judgment threw out her 2016 order for them to pay back about \u20ac800m.\n\nAt the same time she\u2019s pushing for \u201cfair international tax rules so that digitisation doesn\u2019t allow companies to avoid paying their fair share of tax,\u201d according to a speech to German ambassadors last month. She urged them to use \u201cour influence to build an international environment that helps us reach our goals\u201d in talks on a new global agreement to tax technology firms.\n\nApple\u2019s fury at its 2016 EU order saw chief executive Tim Cook blasting the EU move as \u201ctotal political crap.\u201d The company\u2019s legal challenge claims the EU wrongly targeted profits that should be taxed in the US and \u201cretroactively changed the rules\u201d on how global authorities calculate what\u2019s owed to them.\n\nThe US Treasury weighed in too, saying the EU was making itself a \u201csupra-national tax authority\u201d that could threaten global tax reform efforts. President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been silent either, saying Vestager \u201chates the United States\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s suing all our companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a lot at stake given the high-profile nature of the case, as well as the concerns that have been raised from the US Treasury that the investigations risk undermining the international tax system,\u201d said Nicole Robins, a partner at economics consultancy Oxera in Brussels.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The European Commission also declined to comment. Ireland said it \u201cprofoundly\u201d disagreed with the EU\u2019s findings.\n\nRichard Murphy, a professor at London\u2019s City University, said the EU\u2019s case \u201cis about making clear that no company should be beyond the geographic limits of tax law.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelective attempts to get round the law \u2014 which is what tax avoidance is \u2014 are unacceptable when companies seek the protection and support of that same law\u201d in the rest of their business,\u201d Mr Murphy said.\n\nVestager has also fined Google some $9bn. She\u2019s ordered Amazon to pay back taxes \u2014 a mere \u20ac250m \u2014 and is probing Nike Inc.\u2019s tax affairs and looking into Google\u2019s taxation in Ireland.\n\nThe first hints of how the Apple case may turn out will come from a pair of rulings scheduled for 24 September.\n\nThe General Court will rule on whether the EU was right to demand unpaid taxes from Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler. Those judgments could set an important precedent on how far the EU can question tax decisions national governments make on how companies should be treated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the largest companies in the world \u2014 the frightful five I call them \u2014 are hardly paying taxes,\u201d said Paul Tang, a socialist Dutch MEP. \u201cCases like these, Amazon in Luxembourg or Apple in Ireland, started to build public and political pressure\u201d for tax reform in Europe.\n\nThe legal battles may go on for a few years more. The General Court rulings can be appealed once more to the EU\u2019s highest tribunal, the EU Court of Justice. Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s back taxes \u2014 \u20ac14.3bn including interest \u2014 sit in an escrow account and can\u2019t be paid to Ireland until the final legal challenges are exhausted.\n\nFor Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network campaign group, the issue is already in the past and \u201cit\u2019s not even the biggest tax scandal that Apple has\u201d after reports on other structures it may use. Tax reforms under discussion \u201cwill ensure much closer alignment of taxable profits and the real economic activity\u201d generated by them.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "Apple fights the world\u2019s biggest tax case in a quiet courtroom this week, trying to rein in the European Union\u2019s powerful antitrust chief ahead of a potential new crackdown on internet giants.", "authors": ["Stephanie Bodoni"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/11/best-new-iphone-11-pro-max-price.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
