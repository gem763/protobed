Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy. China denies the accusation of meddling in the city.\n\nLam said her administration's actions, including the bill's formal withdrawal, were \"not directly to stop these protests and violence.\"\n\nShe added, \"It is really to express my sincerity to start a dialogue with the people.\"", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday an escalation of violence cannot solve social issues in the Chinese-ruled city and that she deeply regrets foreign parliaments' interference in the financial hub's matters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106108117-1567486158988gettyimages-1165787043.jpeg?v=1567486197", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
