We've known the new Pixelbook would be called the \"Pixelbook Go,\" but other than a few details from Chrome OS commits the device has mostly been a mystery. Google takes its title as \"least secretive device manufacturer\" very seriously, though, and recently 9to5Google managed to just get a Pixelbook Go ahead of the event. They took a bunch of pictures and video.\n\nUnlike the fairly unique design of the original Pixelbook and the Pixel Slate, the Pixelbook Go mostly just looks like a MacBook. 9to5Google got that vibe from the device in person, too, writing: \"We can\u2019t fathom that this laptop won\u2019t immediately be labeled 'Google\u2019s MacBook.'\" The one unique design aspect is the bottom, which is a brightly colored, ribbed pad that covers the entire bottom of the device. This device is a near-final prototype, with placeholder logos and product names.\n\nThe report doesn't nail down the material used to build the laptop (aluminum?), but it does say the laptop has \"what appears to be a painted on coating similar to that of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL.\" The Pixel 2 was a metal phone with a thick coating of paint on top, but this time the finish seems to be smoother and softer.\n\n9to5Google reports the keyboard is \"just as good or better than the first Pixelbook\" and it \"feels great to type on.\" The trackpad is \"a traditional \u201cdiving board\u201d trackpad and seemed sufficiently responsive and \"clicky.\"\n\nThere are single USB-C ports on the left and right side of the laptop, along with LEDs indicating the device's charging status. Like with past Pixelbooks, it seems like you can charge the device from either port. On the right side is also a headphone jack.\n\nThe report also has a full spec sheet:\n\nIntel Core m3, i5, and i7 configurations\n\nEither 8GB or 16GB of RAM\n\n64GB, 128GB, or 256GB of storage\n\n2 front-firing speakers\n\n2MP front-facing camera \u2013 1080p at 60fps\n\nTitan C chip\n\nNormal Wifi and Bluetooth\n\n13.3-inch touch screen\n\n16:9 aspect ratio, both Full HD or 4K \u201cMolecular Display\u201d options\n\nTwo USB-C ports (each with an accompanying LED)\n\n3.5mm headphone jack\n\nTwo colors: \u201cJust Black\u201d and a \u201cNot Pink\u201d\n\nNot included in the spec sheet: a fingerprint reader.\n\nGoogle's tablet and hardware division reportedly received cutbacks in early 2019. After it was clear the company's latest product Chrome OS product, the Microsoft Surface-like Pixel Slate, was a flop, Google Hardware SVP Rick Osterloh admitted the hardware group was cutting back on its portfolio. He said it would no longer make tablets or Surface-style devices.\n\nThe key thing not shown in these leaks is the price. Google Hardware products have typically been very expensive compared to the competition. We'll know more next Tuesday.", "description": "Google's followup to the Pixel Slate is in a much more traditional form factor.", "authors": ["Ron Amadeo"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pixelbook_go_prototype_hands_on_22-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
