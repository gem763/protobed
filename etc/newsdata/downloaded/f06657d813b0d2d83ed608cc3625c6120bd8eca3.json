It is hard to fight to restore the integrity of the court. It is much easier to act like this is normal.\u201d\n\nThe protester went on to falsely claim that Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers had credible evidence against him despite the reality that none of the so-called \u201cevidence\u201d would actually hold up in a court of law.\n\n\u201cIt is easier to continue to treat the justices as gods than to call out the fact that one third of the men on the bench have been credibly accused of sexual harassment and sexual assault,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still believe Anita Hill, and we still believe Christine Blasey Ford, and we still believe Deborah Ramirez.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawyers created this mess, and lawyers have an obligation to our country to fix it,\u201d affirmed the protester.\n\n\u201cSo if I were Brett Kavanaugh, I would not get too comfortable in my new job. A new generation of lawyers is coming, and we will not accept this,\u201d she warned. \u201cThe way the legal profession has operated for too long is ending, and it is ending now.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "One protester\u00a0proclaimed on Sunday that Justice Kavanaugh \"should not get too comfortable\" on the Supreme Court of the United States.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/protester-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
