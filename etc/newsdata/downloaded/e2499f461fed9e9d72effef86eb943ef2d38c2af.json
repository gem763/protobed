And, even after all your hard work squeezing an unnecessary life\u2019s worth of clothes and gear into a getaway bag, there\u2019s still the chance that someone will snag it or it\u2019ll lose its way en route to baggage claim. But these packing products will make it a whole lot easier and keep your stuff safe while you\u2019re on the road. Here are seven packing essentials I can\u2019t travel without.\n\nTile Mate, $25 on Amazon: Tile Mate is a simple Bluetooth tile that hooks onto your luggage and uses a corresponding app to track it in case it gets lost or stolen. The app will show you a map of your luggage\u2019s last known location. And it doesn\u2019t only track your luggage, but it also looks out for your phone. Press the Tile twice to make your phone ring, even if it\u2019s on silent. If you\u2019ve lost everything, log into the Tile Mate website to use the map or make your phone ring from there. Your Tile Mate comes with replaceable batteries and has been engineered to last a year without any maintenance. If you do need to replace it, you can upgrade at a discount through Tile Mate\u2019s replacement program.\n\nMaster Lock Bluetooth Padlock, $120 at Home Depot: One of the smartest items you can pack when traveling is your own padlock so you can lock up your luggage in the airport, at a hostel or hotel, in a luggage storage unit, or anywhere else. This Master Lock Bluetooth padlock is a solid option that features a wide metal body for durability. The shackle also offers maximum resistance to cutting and sawing, so it\u2019ll prove difficult for anyone trying to break in. It\u2019s connected to the free Master Lock Vault eLocks app on your smartphone, which allows you to open it and share access to others to open it, as well. You\u2019ll never have to remember a combination again, and you can monitor access history and receive tamper alerts to keep peace of mind.\n\nPacsafe Luggage Protector, $80 on Amazon: Not all accommodations have lockers, and that can feel disconcerting\u2014unless you\u2019ve got a Pacsafe luggage protector on hand. This anti-theft, patented eXomesh locking system is adjustable to fit over a 55L to an 85L backpack or bag (though there are other size options available). It\u2019s made of high-tensile stainless steel to give thieves a virtually impossible, tough time getting through.\n\nMatador FlatPak Toiletry Bottle, 3-Pack, $35 at Backcountry: Matador\u2019s FlatPak toiletry bottle is a reusable, eco-friendly option for storing your liquid, gel, and paste toiletries\u2014everything from shampoos and conditioners to toothpastes and face scrubs. Not only can you reuse it, but it\u2019s also five times lighter and 3.5 times more compact than traditional silicone travel bottles to save you some serious space in your luggage. At three ounces, it\u2019s TSA approved.\n\nThis is Ground Cord Taco, $9 on Amazon: Clean up the tangled up earbuds, USB cords and other small wires tossed in your backpack or suitcase. These 100% premium leather cord tacos from This is Ground will house your wires in a safe space to prevent them from intertwining, knotting, and splitting. Plus, they\u2019re only 3.25 inches, so they won\u2019t take up any significant space.\n\nEagle Creek\u2019s Pack-It Original Compression Cube Set, $37 on Amazon: Eagle Creek\u2019s original Pack-It Cubes will change the way you pack forever, even if you\u2019re an avid roller. (You can still roll your belongings inside, and fit even more!) They\u2019re lightweight, so you won\u2019t have to worry about exceeding your carry-on weight limits. They boast two-way zippered mouths for maximum compression. And the mesh top allows for breathability and enables you to peek inside, so you don\u2019t have to play any guessing games digging around.\n\nSeal Line Bulkhead Compression Dry Bag, $18-$50 on Amazon: Dry bags come in handy for all sorts of adventures\u2014whether you\u2019re whitewater rafting down the Ganges or going for a hike in fickle weather. But they\u2019re also convenient for packing up wet garments and dirty laundry that you\u2019d really rather not mix in with your clean clothes. Separate it all by stuffing it into a dry bag like this Seal Line Bulkhead compression dry bag. You can roll it up and clip it to compress it, save space, and keep any poor odors from seeping out. The bag is made of 70D nylon ripstop with a polyurethane coating, so what dampness or smelliness goes in isn\u2019t coming out.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
