As a result is is really exciting that a vaccine has been shown to improve on this natural immunity.\"\n\nDr Lewinsohn said the new vaccine had cleared a key \"mid-phase development, and it is designed to test both safety and to provide an early indicator of efficacy\".\n\n\"It is likely that the vaccine will need to be tested in additional populations, and possibly bigger trials before it will be licensed. Assuming the data holds up in the remaining trials, which seems likely, this vaccine has the potential to revolutionise TB treatment.\"\n\nHe estimates, that if if all goes well, the vaccine should be reach people who most need it by about 2028 or so.\n\nResearchers say proving that the vaccine works often requires studies that are much larger than required for viral disease such as measles. Drug firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has been working on the TB vaccine for nearly 20 years.\n\nAn estimated 10 million people fell ill with TB in 2018, a number that has been relatively stable in recent years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), while nearly a quarter of the world's population has latent TB infection.\n\nThis means they carry the bacteria in an inactive form, are not ill and do not transmit the disease to others. People with latent TB have a 5 to 10% risk in their lifetimes of developing active TB.\n\nMeanwhile, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) - a type of tuberculosis which is unresponsive or resistant to at least two of the first line of anti-TB drugs - continues to be a major public health threat. Drug-resistant TB is harder and more expensive to diagnose and treat.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption A sample that tested positive for tuberculosis is seen from a microscope\n\nEight countries account for two thirds of the global TB cases: India (27%), China (9%), Indonesia (8%), the Philippines (6%), Pakistan (6%), Nigeria (4%), Bangladesh (4%) and South Africa (3%).\n\nWith just over one in four of all estimated global cases, India has the highest burden of TB cases in the world.\n\nThe country records nearly 3 million new tuberculosis cases annually, of which more than 100,000 are multi-drug resistant, according to the WHO.\n\nThe disease also kills 400,000 Indians annually, and costs the government around $24bn ($18.68bn) annually.\n\n\"We cannot eliminate TB globally unless we end it in India,\" said Jamhoih Tonsing, director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease's office in Delhi.\n\nThe Union is convenor of the 50th Union World Conference on Lung Health being held in Hyderabad this week.\n\n\"The number of people with TB in India is falling and that is good news. But let\u00b4s be honest - TB is still not falling nearly fast enough in India, progress is still too slow to meet the targets. We need to step up the pace of treatment and prevention,\" she said.\n\nTuberculosis facts", "description": "TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide and kills 1.5 million people each year.", "authors": ["Soutik Biswas", "Bbc India Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8770/production/_109427643_mediaitem109427642.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
