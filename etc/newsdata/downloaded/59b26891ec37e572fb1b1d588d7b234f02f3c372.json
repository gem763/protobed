It\u2019s the second round of grants tied to sweeping opioid legislation that Congress passed on a bipartisan basis last year.\n\n\u201cDifferent states have different needs and different resources of their own. The structure of these grants recognize that,\u201d Health Secretary Alex Azar said.\n\n\u201cStarting with the initial grants last year, however, we did impose one requirement: that treatment providers funded by these grants must make available medication-assisted treatment, which is the gold standard of treatment for opioid addiction.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using $900 million over three years to help state and local governments track overdoses. Roughly $300 million will be disbursed in the first year of the program.\n\nMr. Azar said the nation faced a 12-month lag time in reporting overdose data when Mr. Trump took office, though it\u2019s down to six months. He said the grant money should help states direct their resources more effectively.\n\nMr. Trump has made the opioid fight a signature issue. He declared drug addiction a public health emergency in late 2017, and he\u2019s pressing China to rein in shipments of synthetic opioids before they reach U.S. communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I saw firsthand during the campaign. And I couldn\u2019t believe, when I looked at certain states in particular, how bad it was,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president also touted a new campaign ad to prevent young people from using drugs in the first place.\n\nMr. Azar said provisional data show some progress \u2014 there was a 5% decrease in drug-overdose deaths from 2017 to 2018.\n\n\u201cBut we know we have more work to do,\u201d the secretary said. \u201cMore Americans still need treatment. More Americans need support in entering recovery. And more needs to be done to prevent Americans from becoming addicted in the first place.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
