But after one user posted a behind-the-scenes look, it has people talking about American bakery Panera\u2019s macaroni cheese, which is reheated from a frozen state to a servile temperature in \u2014 horror of horrors \u2014 plastic bags.\n\nThis is fine. In fact, as someone who cooks a lot of food in similar bags, I\u2019m delighted! There\u2019s no reason to be even mildly scandalised, as all Panera is doing is reheating an already cooked product \u2014 something that is very common in the fast food industry \u2014 in a constant temperature water bath. If you\u2019re a regular around these parts, you know the method as \u201cprecision cooking.\u201d\n\nPrecision cooking systems are fantastic meal-planning tools, and this is actually the best possible way for bakeries \u2014 or anyone \u2014 to reheat macaroni and cheese, as it\u2019s a wonderful, proven method for cooking and/or reheating delicate sauces and custards. Unlike microwave ovens or stove burners, the gentle, temperature-controlled water bath heats the mac in the most even way possible (without supervision), gently coaxing it up to its serving temperature while ensuring the cheesy sauce stays emulsified. There\u2019s no breaking or scorching, just perfectly heated, creamy macaroni.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing to be ashamed or or scandalised by, is what I\u2019m saying. In fact, instead of firing the young woman who posted the video, Panera should make like Starbucks, and capitalise on current food trends by rebranding the dish to \u201cPrecision Cooked Mac and Cheese,\u201d which sounds fancy and technically is not a lie.\n\nPrecision cooking, and Panera\u2019s use of it, is a hack that is definitely not wack, and one we can apply in the comfort of our own homes. Just scoop it into a precision cooking bag, close the bag or clip it to the side of the tub, and reheat in a 60-degree water bath for half an hour or more (depending on how much you\u2019re reheating), agitating the bag needed to speed up the heating process. The only thing I would change about Panera\u2019s is a final broiling step with even more cheese \u2014 adding a layer of bubbly, crispy cheese on top of gooey, liquid cheese is perhaps the ultimate mac and cheese hack.", "description": "Besides forcing society to examine what comedy really is, TikTok drives all sorts of discourse, both political and not.
