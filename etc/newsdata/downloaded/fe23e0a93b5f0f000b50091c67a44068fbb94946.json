That was far bigger than the last number that Facebook had disclosed of 400 app suspensions in August 2018.\n\nThe extent of how many apps Facebook had cut off was revealed in court filings that were unsealed later on Friday by a state court in Boston, as part of an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general into the technology company. The documents showed that Facebook had suspended 69,000 apps. Of those, the majority were terminated because the developers did not cooperate with Facebook\u2019s investigation; 10,000 were flagged for potentially misappropriating personal data from Facebook users.\n\nThe disclosures about app suspensions renew questions about whether people\u2019s personal information on Facebook is secure, even after the company has been under fire for more than a year for its privacy practices.", "description": "The scale of suspensions, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was far larger than the social network had previously revealed.", "authors": ["Kate Conger", "Gabriel J.X.
