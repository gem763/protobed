On October 10, a new generation of drivers will test their mettle on the one of Australia's toughest Supercar circuits: the Bathurst 1000. Here's how to watch the race live, free and online in Australia.\n\nWhere Is The Bathurst 1000?\n\nThe Bathurst 1000 is held in Bathurst, New South Wales on the Mount Panorama Circuit.\n\nWhen Is The Bathurst 1000?\n\nThe 161 lap race that is the marquee event of the weekend occurs on Sunday, October 13 at 11:30am Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT). The race will conclude at approximately 6:30pm on the same day.\n\nHere\u2019s the times in all Australian capital cities:\n\nPerth, WA: 8:30am\n\n8:30am Darwin, NT: 10am\n\n10am Brisbane, QLD: 10:30am\n\n10:30am Adelaide, SA: 11am\n\n11am Sydney, NSW: 11:30am\n\n11:30am Canberra, ACT: 11:30am\n\n11:30am Melbourne, VIC: 11:30am\n\n11:30am Hobart, TAS: 11:30am\n\nIf you're keen to watch the preceding Supercar races - of which there are more than 30 - the action starts on Thursday, October 10.\n\nOn Saturday, October 12, there is a practice session at 9:40 AEDT before the Top Ten Shootout, which takes place at 5:05pm AEDT. (You can check out the full schedule below.)\n\nHow To Stream The Bathurst 1000 In Australia\n\nIf you\u2019re without a TV and want to stream the race, your best bet is to use Kayo Sports. This is Foxtel's dedicated sports streaming platform which will be showing all the races including the ultimate Virgin Australia Supercars Championship.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t signed up to Kayo before, you can activate a two week trial for free. After the trial, pricing starts at $25 per month but there's no lock-in contract, so you can cancel at any time.\n\nHow To Watch The Bathurst 1000 On TV\n\nIf you\u2019re in Australia, you\u2019ve got a couple of options \u2013 the most obvious would be to catch it on free to air TV, with Channel Ten broadcasting all the action from Friday to Sunday. Unfortunately, if you were looking to stream it online, via the tenplay app, this will not be possible for any of the Bathurst coverage.\n\nFox Sports channel 506, on Foxtel, will be covering all the events, starting as early as 7:15am AEDT each day.\n\nWhere Can I Get Tickets To The Bathurst 1000?\n\nTicketek is the official provider of tickets to the Bathurst 1000. If you are looking to go to the event and trek up the mountain, then you will need to click here to purchase.\n\nHow To Watch The Bathurst 1000 Overseas\n\nNew Zealanders can use the Sky Go platform to stream the race, but you will need to sign up for Sky and download the Sky Go app or go to the live desktop site.\n\nIf you live outside of Australia and New Zealand, you may need to invest in Superview, which is the streaming subscription offered by the Supercar championship. This gives you livestreaming access to every race of the Supercar season, not just Bathurst, but it will set you back approximately $40.\n\nAlternatively, shop around for a VPN provider with access to Australian servers and then sign up to the aforementioned Foxtel Now free trial. Here are some recommended VPNs to consider.\n\nYou can also sign up for Motor Trend On Demand, a live streaming and on demand content service specifically for automotive events. Currently, they offer a 14 day free trial period just like with Foxtel Now. (If you're in Australia, you can still use this service, but you will have to access it through a VPN.)\n\nBathurst 1000 on Reddit\n\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to keep one eye firmly planted on the Reddit group for the V8 Supercars. In addition to having fun discussions with like-minded auto fans via IRC, the group will direct you to broadcast feeds of race control and potentially other streams that become available on free streaming sites.\n\nA second Reddit community, r/motorsportsstreams, provides links to motor sports events around the world, including Bathurst. (To use the streams provided here, you will need VLC Media Player.)\n\nTo load the stream link into VLC, open VLC, click on 'Media' in the toolbar, then 'Open Network Stream' and paste the link in the dialog box. Be wary, these streams may buffer frequently, depending on their origin.\n\nBathurst 1000 Race Schedule\n\nHere's the full schedule for the die-hard rev heads out there:\n\nTHURSDAY OCTOBER 10", "description": "It's been nigh on 60 years since the first 'Great Race' in Bathurst's Mount Panorama.
