Anthony Johnson\n\nMr Davis \u2013 who will leave Bank of Queensland this month \u2013 concedes that rugby has changed since he played the game, especially since it went professional in 1995. The rough and tumble nature of the amateur days has mostly been rubbed out.\n\n\"It's a very different game to what it was in the old days, it's much more athletic,\" he said.\n\n\"The rules are very technical now. It's television and video too \u2013 everyone has a camera. The benefits of slow motion. It's changed the way we play the game.\"\n\nMr Davis said World Rugby was following the lead of the NFL in the United States, which is expected to pay out close to $1 billion in concussion settlements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Movies like Concussion, the impact of that has really heightened awareness of what can happen down the line after you finish playing and the benefit of science, and they are right to focus on this stuff,\" he said.\n\nMost former players will begrudgingly admit it's been a positive move for the rugby governing body to ban contact with the head. But they would prefer some consistency in the application of the laws.\n\nRampaging Wallaby centre Samu Kerevi's punishment for an aggressive ball carry in last week's loss against Wales was the latest decision that left fans scratching their heads.\n\nFormer Wallabies winger Drew Mitchell said players accepted there was a risk when they played the game, but he was worried that officialdom had gone too far.\n\n\u201cWe sign up to play rugby and sometimes there is going to be contact to the head. It\u2019s just part of it and as players, we accept that,\" he told Fox Sports.\n\n\"I fear that this is the World Cup that\u2019s remembered for yellow cards, red cards and sanctions.\"\n\nAustralia's quest to win a third World Cup continues when they take on Uruguay in Oita on Saturday where the much-hyped 19-year-old winger Jordan Petaia will make his Test debut.\n\nDespite the loss to Wales last weekend, the Michael Cheika-coached Australia should beat Uruguay and Georgia to finish second in their pool.\n\nThis would most likely mean a quarter-final against England, coached by former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones.", "description": "The spate of bans at the Rugby World Cup in Japan has raised fears that referees are ruining the game.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2612%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_301%2C$y_15/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f675e72586d8f03bc20ef9939a1c512816d1eaad", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
