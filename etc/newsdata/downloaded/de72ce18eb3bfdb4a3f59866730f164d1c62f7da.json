They said the company should \u201creconsider\u201d its recent punishments, but otherwise made no specific demands or threatened any follow-up actions by Congress.\n\n\u201cWe write to express our deep concern over Activision Blizzard\u2019s decision to make player Ng Wai Chung forfeit prize money and ban him from participating in tournaments for a year after he voiced support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong,\u201d the letter said.\n\nActivision Blizzard punished Chung after he said \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,\u201d on a post-match stream on October 6. The punishment upset fans, politicians, and commentators, who condemned Activision Blizzard for censoring a player over his politics. The perception was that Activision Blizzard took action because it does a lot of business in China and didn\u2019t want to upset Beijing.\n\n\u201cYour company claims to stand by \u2018one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions,\u2019 yet many of your own employees believe that Activision Blizzard\u2019s decision to punish Mr. Chung runs counter to those values,\u201d the politicians said in their letter.\n\nThe letter comes after a week of controversy for Activision Blizzard. Some employees felt that the gaming company had abandoned its core values and failed to communicate its workers. Streamers and commentators publicly cut ties with Blizzard. Late on a Friday night last week, a time when most people have logged off for the weekend, Activision Blizzard broke its silence in a public statement and promised to return Chung\u2019s prize money and half the length of his suspension. But it still reserved the right to silence players at will.\n\nAccess Now, a group that campaigns for human rights around the world,condemned Blizzard after it the gaming company made its public statement. Blizzard canceled a public event to celebrate the of the Switch port of Overwatch, postponed a World of Warcraft event in Taiwan, and suspended three more Hearthstone players for additional pro-Hong Kong protests..\n\nTwo Blizzard employees spoke with VICE on condition of anonymity, due to fear of retaliation for speaking out and said that the mood in the office has been \u201cnegative\u201d and it only got worse after Blizzard made its official statement.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to understand how we waited so long for such a tepid, timid, and frankly tone-deaf response,\u201d one employee said. \u201cI just feel that much more forlorn knowing that this was the best effort after four tense days, particularly since we're unlikely to see further action. I'm sure many headed home today feeling even more bewildered at the state of things and merely relieved that this seemingly endless week is finally over.\u201d\n\n\"The mood around the offices initially appeared to be...\u2018The situation sucks, but it was the better choice for the business as otherwise it could severely hurt our growth in China,\u2019\u2019 another employee said. \u201cAfter the post, everything seemed to change. Far more employees were willing to speak out on Slack about how the message was tone deaf, not well thought out, and overall negative views toward leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thoughts keep returning this week to Colin Kaepernick,\u201d one Blizzard employee said, recalling the football player\u2019s protest of police violence during the National Anthem at NFL games. \u201cIt really seems that in running our esport, we've learned exactly the wrong lessons from the NFL's handling of another courageous man speaking up for so many who can't.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYour company claims to stand by \u2018one\u2019s right to express individual thoughts and opinions,\u2019 yet many of your own employees believe that Activision Blizzard\u2019s decision to punish Mr. Chung runs counter to those values.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daa22568434b4000a443147/lede/1571431617679-GettyImages-1173479824-copy.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
