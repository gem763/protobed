It is believed the home had been owned by the Telfer family.\n\n\u201cOur house was the only one that had a phone \u2014 so anyone who needed the doctor or whatever would come here to make a call,\u201d Ms Childs said.\n\n\u201cWe know one of the owner\u2019s sons went off to war and I think the mother put the penny in the concrete as a lucky symbol that he would come home.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know much about the soldier although I did try to look him up online but with no luck so I haven\u2019t been able to verify the story.\u201d\n\nThe home has a north-facing parklike rear garden with mature trees and sprawling lawn.\n\nIt is an idyllic outdoor space for families that is hard to find in newer housing estates of today.\n\nThe residence also has charming street appeal with its box bay window, veranda and terracotta tiled roof.\n\nStepping inside its renovated interior, it is clear that the bungalow\u2019s character has not been lost even with its contemporary updates.\n\nDramatic dark walls contrast with bright white ceilings and skirting boards. It has high ceilings, decorative cornices, picture rails, polished floorboards and slash style windows.\n\nInside Sam Armytage's country retreat Inside Sam Armytage's country retreat\n\nThe kitchen, with stone benchtops and Bosch gas appliances, adjoins the open planned family and meals area. A wall of sliding French timber doors opens up to reveal a large deck overlooking the garden.\n\nA separate lounge room, with a jetmaster wood-burning fireplace, is the perfect winter retreat and offers a second living space. The updated bathroom is also in keeping with the home\u2019s 1939 vintage.\n\nAfter 17 years of ownership, the family have decided it is time to move one but admit it will be hard to leave.\n\n\u201cI think our favourite spot has been the backyard and also the open flow to the house,\u201d Ms Childs said.\n\n\u201cWe have the backdoors wide open and we can see the beautiful tree out the back \u2014 it feels like you are in the outdoors even when you are sitting inside. It really does look like a park and that is what I will miss the most.\u201d\n\nThe property is being auctioned on Saturday November 9 at 10.45am though Jennifer Carr from Louis Carr Real Estate.", "description": "Underneath the clothesline in the backyard of this Baulkham Hills home is a 1939 penny set in a concrete base.", "authors": ["Katrina Creer"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9af6f72502634a791f2f8d9f916de087?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
