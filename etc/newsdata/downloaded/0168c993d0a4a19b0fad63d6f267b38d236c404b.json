This includes taxidermy animals, skulls and ancient weapons.\n\nMichael Diamond was given the doll Mr Fritz (pictured in glass cabinet), made by a prisoner at the World War II Stalag II-B camp, three months ago\n\nMr Diamond added how he gets 'emotionally attached' to his collections and the reason why is a 'million dollar question'.\n\nWhile he is married to Sally and has two children, Amber, 19 and Caleb, 11, he wants to give his doll a permanent home.\n\n'I have no idea myself. I don't even know where to start. There are no open windows in the room and no airflow. The door is on a latch so shouldn't just swing open.\n\nHe set up a GoPro camera over September 18 and 19 after noticing the door kept swinging open and to his horror, saw the doll blinking its eyes and opening its mouth when he watched the footage\n\n'I have told Sally and Amber about it and they don't like it at all. To stop it from happening I've chained the box up and covered it in a blanket.'\n\nThe father-of-two speculates that the prisoner, who created the doll, worked as a ventriloquist before being taken prisoner at Stalag II-B.\n\nThis camp was one of the first Nazi concentration camps in 1933 for German communists and went on to become a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish soldiers from the Pomorze Army.\n\nMr Fritz was allegedly taken to America after the end of the war and was owned by an antiques shop in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, before arriving in the UK.", "description": "Michael Diamond was given the doll Mr Fritz, made by a prisoner at the World War II Stalag II-B camp, in July.
