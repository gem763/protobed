One estimate indicates 9 percent of those experiencing homelessness are veterans, nearly 38,000 individuals in total.\n\nThe mention of people experiencing homelessness might seem like something of a non sequitur, an unusual topic that had found its way into Trump\u2019s speech. As The Washington Post has reported during the past week, though, Trump\u2019s administration has quietly been planning a crackdown on homeless camps in California, including visiting unused government facilities to determine if they could serve as housing.\n\nAn administration official wanted to assure The Post that things hadn\u2019t progressed too far, telling Jeff Stein, Josh Dawsey and Tracy Jan that \u201cwe\u2019re not rounding people up or anything yet.\u201d\n\nFrom New Mexico, Trump on Tuesday flew to the San Francisco Peninsula in California. San Francisco is one of the cities that have been an apparent target of Trump\u2019s frustration over homelessness, and, we learned Monday, that problem overlaps with America\u2019s veterans.\n\nTrump was asked about possible plans to address homelessness on the flight and said it was something he was considering.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump said, according to a report from the White House news pool. \u201cAnd I\u2019m speaking to tenants \u2014 in some cases foreign people, foreign tenants \u2014 but they have where they\u2019re tenants in buildings throughout various cities in California, and other places \u2026 where they want to leave the country. They can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned police getting sick of addressing homelessness problems, then returning to those tenants.\n\n\u201cWe have people living in our \u2026 best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings and pay tremendous taxes, where people in those buildings pay tremendous taxes, where they went to those locations because of the prestige,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many cases, they came from other countries, and they moved to Los Angeles or they moved to San Francisco because of the prestige of the city, and all of a sudden they have tents. Hundreds and hundreds of tents and people living at the entrance to their office building. And they want to leave.\n\n\u201cAnd the people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re looking at it, and we\u2019ll be doing something about it.\u201d\n\nWhen The Post first reported on the possibility that Trump wanted to address the homelessness issue, we noted it had been something of a focus of conservative media. Back in July, Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson raised the issue of homelessness and urban decay in an interview with Trump. Then Trump inexplicably declared it was \u201ca phenomena that started two years ago\u201d and blamed Democratic leaders.\n\nHis answer on Tuesday makes a lot more sense. The focus of his concern, as presented to reporters on Air Force One, wasn\u2019t Americans or veterans, but foreigners who rent or buy high-end real estate, people who get frustrated at seeing those experiencing homelessness at the entrance to their office buildings. It\u2019s the sort of complaint that might resonate with someone who owns real estate in major U.S. cities that is used for housing or office space.\n\nSomeone, in other words, like Donald Trump, whose Trump Organization owns 30 percent of what used to be known as the Bank of America tower in San Francisco, an office building in that city. The Trump Organization also owns properties in Los Angeles and, of course, New York City. Trump has been in the business of appealing to real estate investors for a lot longer than he\u2019s been in the business of running the United States, so it\u2019s not really a surprise he would view the homelessness problem through the lens of someone who needs to get people to see Trump Tower as the pinnacle of refinement.\n\nTrump is well aware of how people experiencing homelessness can make a property less appealing. As CNN reported during the campaign, Trump once proposed housing people who are homeless in one of his buildings \u2014 in an apparent effort to oust rent-controlled tenants from the property.\n\nIt\u2019s remarkable, though, that Trump went as far as to frame this as a concern for foreign tenants. Foreign investors are central to much of the high-end real estate market, prompting Donald Trump Jr. in 2008 to remark that \u201c[i]n terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\u201d But even if that is a central concern of Trump\u2019s in this case, it seems odd to mention it explicitly. To the rally crowd, concern for the veterans. To reporters, it\u2019s apparently about tax bases and appealing to the foreign market.\n\nThese, it seems, are the sorts of immigrants that Trump is happy to welcome, the sorts who want to ensure the properties they buy are prestigious. If we need to move those experiencing homelessness to an old FAA building, so be it.\n\nFirst things first.", "description": "An out-of-the-blue insistence suddenly makes more sense.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/57SLESGIFQI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
