Our businesses will be destroyed,\u201d said Mkhitar Stepanyan, who sells medicinal herbs.\n\n\u201cNobody will buy my herbs in fear they are poisoned by the discharges from the mine,\u201d he said, looking anxiously at sheaves of chamomile, St. John\u2019s wort, and mint piled up at his kiosk.\n\nThe planned mine is near the sources of rivers which flow into picturesque Lake Sevan, another tourist draw and the country\u2019s main source of drinking water.\n\nDemonstrations against the mine have spread to the capital Yerevan, where thousands of people took to the streets last month chanting: \u201cNo to ecological disaster!\u201d\n\nIn August, protesters blockaded the country\u2019s presidential palace and parliament, demanding the project be ditched.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Unmanageable ecological consequences\u2019 \u2013\n\nLydian, which has already spent some $400 million to develop Amulsar\u2019s deposits of gold ore \u2014 which contain an estimated 40 tons of pure gold \u2014 has dismissed ecologists\u2019 fears as unsubstantiated.\n\nThe company denounced an \u201cenormous misinformation around the Amulsar project\u201d as part of a \u201ccampaign by rival mining companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cLydian has been fully transparent in its environmental and operating practices. Those practices meet or exceed all applicable international standards,\u201d the company\u2019s managing director, Hayk Aloyan, told AFP.\n\nBut local ecologists have warned of the potential dangers.\n\nKarine Danielyan, head of the NGO Association For Sustainable Human Development, said chemicals used in the mining process could lead to the oxidation of water in major rivers.\n\nThis would make them \u201cunusable for irrigation and drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWater pollution could harm irreparably the ecosystem of the Lake Sevan and the mineral water sources in Jermuk,\u201d the resort which gave its name to Armenia\u2019s most famous mineral water brand, she said.\n\nThe director of Armenia\u2019s Institute of Chemical Physics, Seyran Minasyan, warned of \u201cunmanageable ecological consequences\u201d if the project is given the go-ahead.\n\n\u201cAll the mines in Armenia are being operated barbarically, with no respect of ecological norms,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 Shaken public trust \u2013\n\nIn a video statement posted when protests broke out in Yerevan, Pashinyan insisted the project would be completed and downplayed potential ecological risks.\n\nHe said Armenia\u2019s investment climate will be seriously damaged if the project \u2014 which will boost Armenia\u2019s GDP by $185 million annually and create hundreds of well-paid jobs \u2014 goes under.\n\nPolitical analysts said Pashinyan\u2019s backing of the project has shaken public trust in the leader, who has enjoyed widespread popularity among Armenians, long frustrated with the corrupt elites he has swept from power.\n\n\u201cThe Amulsar case might lead to divisions within Pashinyan\u2019s ruling-party majority in parliament,\u201d said analyst Vigen Hakobyan.\n\n\u201cHe is under serious pressure both from civil society and from a big transnational corporation backed by the US and British governments.\u201d", "description": "Gndevaz (Armenia) (AFP) \u2013 Armenian villagers are locked in what they say is a David-and-Goliath style battle for the environment and their", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/fe45fa_cows-graze-armenian-village-gndevaz-locals-are-angry-goldmining-plans-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
