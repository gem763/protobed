REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s Tianqi Lithium Corp (002466.SZ), one of the world\u2019s biggest lithium producers, said on Tuesday that its Australian unit had signed a long-term supply agreement with Swedish battery maker Northvolt.\n\nTianqi Lithium Kwinana, which recently launched a processing plant in Western Australia, will supply lithium hydroxide, a chemical used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, to Northvolt Ett from 2020-25, Tianqi said in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\n\nNorthvolt Ett is the name of Northvolt\u2019s planned lithium-ion battery plant in northern Sweden. What will be Europe\u2019s largest such plant is due to begin production in 2021 and counts German automakers Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) among its investors.\n\nThe filing gave no absolute tonnage figure for the deal but said that the volume supplied each year would be no lower than 6-10% of Tianqi Kwinana\u2019s annual capacity.\n\nThe deal marks the second major customer win for Tianqi in a little more than a month. The company announced on Aug. 22 that it had signed up South Korea\u2019s LG Chem (051910.KS) on a three-year deal covering 2020-22 for no less than 15% of Kwinana\u2019s annual capacity.\n\nTianqi Lithium Kwinana started production of lithium hydroxide this month, with its first phase output to ramp up to the full 24,000 tonnes a year over the next 12-18 months.\n\nCapacity will double to 48,000 tonnes with a second stage, though Tianqi has put that on hold until the ramp-up of the first phase is complete because lithium prices remain depressed.\n\nAmid a wave of new supply and adjustments to EV subsidies in China, lithium hydroxide prices AM-LIOH0002-LHM, as assessed by industry information provider Asian Metal, have fallen by 36.8% this year to 67,000 yuan ($9,428.25) a tonne.", "description": "China's Tianqi Lithium Corp <002466.SZ>, one of the world's biggest lithium producers, said on Tuesday that its Australian unit had signed a long-term supply agreement with Swedish battery maker Northvolt.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433343539&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N15I", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
