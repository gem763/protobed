Lots of airlines have felt some level of impact from the destructive hurricane, but JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) have been the worst hit, due to their big footprints in the state.\n\nThis hurricane is hitting at a particularly inopportune time for Spirit Airlines. The budget carrier had already experienced a big jump in flight cancellations during the spring and summer, due to an unfortunate combination of overly aggressive flight schedules (leaving little margin for error), runway construction in Fort Lauderdale, and bad weather. As a result, management expects the carrier's profit margin to sink this quarter. A hurricane-related surge in flight cancellations to end the Labor Day long weekend will only add to its woes.\n\nWhy JetBlue and Spirit Airlines are feeling the biggest impacts\n\nHigh winds forced numerous airports in Florida to close while Hurricane Dorian paused offshore. This included two of the three busiest airports in the state: Orlando International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. (Miami International Airport, despite its proximity to Fort Lauderdale, was able to remain open.)\n\nBoth airports are low-cost carrier meccas. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando are JetBlue focus cities, although they are smaller than the carrier's main bases in New York and Boston. Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines is headquartered near Fort Lauderdale, where it maintains its largest focus city. (Indeed, JetBlue and Spirit -- in that order -- are the two largest airlines in Fort Lauderdale.) And in recent years, Spirit Airlines has built up a sizable operation in Orlando.\n\nA yellow Spirit Airlines jet parked at a gate.

This may have been due to airlines trying to get their planes out of the path of the storm ahead of the airport's planned closure at 2 a.m. on Monday. Ultimately, Orlando International Airport stayed open on Monday due to a change in the storm's path, closing at 2 a.m. on Tuesday instead. Nevertheless, about a third of the airport's scheduled flights were canceled on Monday. The airport didn't reopen until around noon on Wednesday.\n\nThe airport in Fort Lauderdale closed at noon on Monday and reopened 24 hours later, at noon on Tuesday. Consequently, nearly three-quarters of its scheduled flights were canceled on Monday, followed by the cancellation of about 40% of its flights on Tuesday.\n\nAssessing the damage\n\nThe net result of all these airport closures and other disruption was that Spirit Airlines canceled 150 flights on Sunday, 272 flights on Monday, and 192 flights on Tuesday. That accounted for approximately 20%, 37%, and 26% of its scheduled flights on each day. Due to this high volume of flight cancellations -- and its lack of interline agreements with other carriers -- Spirit could be forced to spend huge sums of money to buy full-price tickets on other airlines to get its customers where they need to be.", "description": "Flight cancellations have been a big problem for Spirit Airlines all spring and summer, so a big, slow-moving hurricane was the last thing it needed to close out Labor Day weekend.", "authors": ["Adam Levine-Weinberg", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LlZO5bHKgkaUxCuXBz_ywQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/149a9addb63dcee560eb6d93c0c5514a"}
