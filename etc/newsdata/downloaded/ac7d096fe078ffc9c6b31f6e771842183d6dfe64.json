I physically feel as though I am going to be sick each time I go by.\u201d\n\nIn the correspondence from February, which was released following a Freedom of Information request by the New Statesman, she also expressed concern that the homeless had stacked up bedding at the station, which she said \u201ccould be used by some unscrupulous people as a cover up for an explosive device\u201d.\n\nHudson-Wilkin went on to say that she had asked to speak with an official at Transport for London on a number of occasions but had been directed Westminster council.\n\n\u201cI really am beginning to feel unsafe personally and equally for everyone else who uses that exit/entrance,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a statement released to the Guardian via the Diocese of Canterbury, she said: \u201cEvery week in my prayers in the chapel, I pray for those who are homeless in our city and those who have died on our streets.\n\n\u201cThese comments arose not only out of my concern for the safety and wellbeing of parliamentary staff, but also out of concern for those for whom this is their daily reality. We may find it unpleasant and concerning to walk through the underground station on the way to work or home, but for those who have to live like this \u2013 forgotten and overlooked by society \u2013 it is so much worse. Nobody should have to live like this.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cmoving people on\u201d would not solve the issue, which required national and systemic problems being addressed.\n\nThe email to Natzler and Hepburn was sent two months after the death of Gyula Remes, 43, a homeless man whose body was found in an underpass linking Westminster tube station to an entrance leading to the Houses of Parliament.\n\nIn February 2018 the death of Marcos Amaral Gourgel drew widespread media attention after he died in freezing weather at Westminster tube station next parliament.", "description": "Rose Hudson-Wilkin also complained about security risk of Westminster homeless", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/3500_(4).jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=840ed6c3a4718d50067a583b782fbad5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
