The dominance a footnote.\n\nBy the end of the first 45 minutes in Bulgaria, a football match became a test of whether world football is still prepared to tolerate young black men being abused on the basis of the colour of their skin.\n\nAnswer: It is. In this sport the game comes first at any cost. So they played on.\n\nWould we ask female athletes to perform through clearly audible sexist abuse? No we wouldn\u2019t.\n\nWould we stomach homophobic abuse? Same answer.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nYet thugs around the world continue to get chance after chance to hurl their racist filth and nazi salutes at black footballers.\n\nOne day we will look back and wonder how on earth we could have allowed this to happen.\n\nFor now - yet again - we\u2019ve left it to the authorities. Let\u2019s find out what they actually do.\n\nBear in mind the officials didn\u2019t even acknowledge the first-half monkey chanting until they were alerted to it by the Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings. What a sad England debut for him.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nAdded to that, on past form UEFA, European football\u2019s governing body, has shown itself utterly incapable of ensuring the punishment for racism fits the crime. Why should this occasion be any different? With zero black representation at decision-making level they simply don\u2019t care.\n\nExpect a fine of around \u00a3100,000 for Bulgaria in a few months time.\n\nHome fans were turning up to the stadium wearing tops emblazoned with the message: \u2018UEFA Mafia - No respect\u2019.\n\nYes, after the second appeal on the PA system for the Bulgarian ultras to stop abusing England\u2019s black stars a significant number of them left.\n\nBut the abuse did not go away in the second half.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFor all the triumphalism about the success of the three-step protocol - warning fans to stop or risk seeing the game abandoned - many will feel it did not work.\n\nUEFA argued during the second half that there were only \u2018isolated\u2019 pockets of abuse during the second half. So that\u2019s alright then.\n\nThe truth is that the black players don\u2019t want to experience any of it, their white colleagues don\u2019t want to have to support them through it and we as a public are sick of having to witness it. They should have walked off.\n\nThe England stars in Bulgaria later explained they wanted to continue the game. The widely-held view, however, it that it is bigger than them. It is about drawing a line in the sand for all of us.\n\n(Image: Sportimage)\n\n(Image: GEORGI LICOVSKI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nAt some point a high-profile player or team will have to do what NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick did when he took a knee?\n\nOr what Jon Carlos and Tommie Smith did with their Black Power salute at the 1969 Olympics in pursuit of social justice. Sometimes the issue is bigger than the sport.\n\nAnd what to do about Bulgaria? The answer is simple.\n\nThrow countries guilty of racist behaviour out of competitions. Internationally and domestically. Issue them with a suspended sentence ahead of the other forthcoming competitions. If they offend again, they are out.\n\nDraconian maybe but a solution that would send shock waves through a lot of countries - and clubs. It would also focus a few minds here in England on actually getting their house in order.\n\nFines don\u2019t work. Nor do stadium closures. Slogans don\u2019t work. Soundbites and condemnations aren\u2019t worth the paper they are written on.\n\nFootball has had decades to address the cancer of racism with which it is riddled.\n\nIt has taken the full, naked, ugly truth to present itself in a crucial match in a major competition for the wider world to wake up.", "description": "England stars suffered racist abuse at the hands of Bulgaria fans during their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Andy Commins", "Daily Mirror", "Getty Images", "Sportimage", "Georgi Licovski Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20581069.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
