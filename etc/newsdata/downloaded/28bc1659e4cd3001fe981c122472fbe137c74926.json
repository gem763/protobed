After the report, oil dropped more than 2.6% at about 12:30 p.m. on Monday in London.\n\nReuters, citing an unnamed source, reported that Saudi Arabia has already got about 75% of its output up and running since the attacks on Saudi Aramco fields last weekend.\n\n\"Saudi's oil production from Khurais is now at more than 1.3 million barrels per day, while current production from Abqaiq is at about 3 million barrels per day,\" Reuters said, citing one unnamed source.\n\nBut less than 24 hours before, oil had soared after a vastly different headline from Wall Street Journal: \"Aramco's Repairs Could Take Months Longer Than Company Anticipates, Contractors Say.\" Oil has rallied almost 1% on the back of that report.\n\nWhile investors are selling, for now, \"It's a mess of conflicting reports,\" said Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com. \"No one knows what is accurate info.\"\n\nTwo of Saudi's main oil-producing facilities on September 14 were hit by strikes, temporarily wiping out half of the country's oil production.\n\nMarkets skyrocketed, with prices initially surging 20% after the attacks. Since then, prices have remained much higher, as on Monday Brent crude oil is hovering at about 5% higher than before the attacks.\n\nIn response, Saudi said that its oil production would be up and running much sooner than initially anticipated - within 10 weeks according to Saudi officials.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing Saudi officials and contractors, the Journal reported that the 10 weeks would be a fraction of the time it would take to repair the damage.", "description": "The drop followed a rally after a weekend report that production would take longer than thought. \"No one knows what\u2019s accurate info!\" said one analyst.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9389/1284535d1bd2422082aad6928aa04d47.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
