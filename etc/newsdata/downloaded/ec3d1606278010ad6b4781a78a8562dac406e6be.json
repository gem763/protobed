It\u2019s becoming very, very difficult to care which one you have \u2013 so I always feel faintly sorry for Apple, with its commitment to epic annual launch events where CEO Tim Cook reveals a roster of identical phones as if he\u2019s unveiling the Ten Commandments.\n\nIt lacks bells and whistles, such as the zoom lens and sharper OLED screen of the Pro models, but the iPhone 11 a competent little phone. Just don\u2019t expect it to revolutionise your life\n\nBut I tried the modest iPhone 11 (rather than the \u00a31,049+ Pro handsets), and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been hanging on to an ancient, half-dead handset with the obligatory smashed screen, waiting for the \u2018right\u2019 iPhone to upgrade to, this \u00a3729 handset is a decent choice.\n\nThe key change is that Apple no longer lags behind Google and Samsung on the camera front (although iPhone 11 misses some of the gizmos you find in top-end Samsungs such as the ability to charge other phones wirelessly from your own, a power my wife abuses constantly).\n\nThe key change is that Apple no longer lags behind Google and Samsung on the camera front\n\nNight mode is the star performer here, meaning you can finally take shots after 7pm. It turns on automatically, sprucing up pictures so you can no longer escape the all-seeing eye of social media, even at night. It lacks bells and whistles, such as the zoom lens and sharper OLED screen of the Pro models, but it\u2019s a competent little phone.
