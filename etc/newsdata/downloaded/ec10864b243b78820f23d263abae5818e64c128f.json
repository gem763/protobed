It was just unbelievable. You know that theoretically everyone has the chance at winning when they play, but you never think it would be you.\n\n\"It was just before Christmas and it absolutely changed our lives. I was going to retire in the February but could retire early and Steve now works four days a week.\n\n\"We were renting a house off the housing association but we now have our own and have helped our kids get on the property ladder too, as well as going on cruises, and still have money left over.\n\n\"Steve really is proud of his man cave that we had built - he had a wooden shed in the other house with a booze fridge in it but now he has his own proper place to go to. I join him there now and again for a drink, but I've got my own gym shack to go to as well.\"\n\nSteve's man shed is set to feature in a unique and uplifting photo exhibition to mark the 25th birthday of The National Lottery.\n\nThe photo exhibition will be placed at the historic lottery-funded Fulham Palace in London and runs from October 30 to November 10.\n\nIt showcases the inspiring, obscure and heartfelt stories behind what winners of The National Lottery have purchased with their prize money.", "description": "Steve and Jill Walsh, from Hull, won the huge sum of money on the Lotto Millionaire Raffle in 2016", "authors": ["Anna Riley", "Tanveer Mann", "Image", "Nigel Roddis Hull Daily Mail", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703192.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Steve-and-Jill-Walsh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
