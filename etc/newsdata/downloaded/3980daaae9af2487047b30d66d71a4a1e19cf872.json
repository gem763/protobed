Doe claimed Riff Raff then took a bag full of the cash that the women had earned earlier that night as dancers and said, \u201cIf you want this money back, you are both going to fuck me,\u201d and, \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not going to like what\u2019s going to happen and you are not getting your precious money back.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, Jane Doe said the women agreed to have sex with Riff Raff and DollaBillGates, after which the rappers gave them their money back.\n\nRiff Raff denied the allegations, saying in a court declaration from Sept. 14, 2016: \u201cI did not sexually assault [Jane Doe], nor did I have any sexual contact with her whatsoever.\u201d\n\nPitchfork reports the other woman, Sara, also denied their had been any sexual assault in an interview with cops, saying she was not \u201cfearful,\u201d nor did she \u201cfeel forced\u201d and that Jane Doe was \u201cjust trying to make up stories.\u201d\n\nThe criminal case was closed, with the investigating detective saying Doe\u2019s \u201cunbelievable and ever-changing accounts preclude this investigation from continuing further.\u201d He cited 14 discrepancies in the case, Pitchfork says.\n\nHowever, Doe\u2019s civil suit remained open.\n\nEarlier this year, Riff Raff was accused of rape by an Australian woman who alleged he sexually assaulted her in 2013, when she was 19 years old, after drugging her with codeine and alcohol.\n\nIn a disturbing Facebook post, Eliza Stafford, an Australian woman from Melbourne, accused Riff Raff of drugging and raping her.\n\nAfter being invited backstage, Staffford alleges she was \u201coffered a 60ml \u2018party\u2019 shot. I took the shot, it was syrup and I immediately asked what it was. Riff Raff and his support act told me that it was codeine and started laughing. I don\u2019t remember anything from that point. I woke up as Riff Raff was pulling out of me and getting into the shower.\u201d\n\nShe spoke out after Riff Raff announced a new tour of Australia, which was swiftly canceled by the promoters.\n\nHe denied the allegations. In a video called \u201cTrial by Media,\u201d he stated, \u201cNever once have I forced a girl to have sex. Never once have I forced a girl to do any type of drugs. I don\u2019t want to have a girl drunk and sleepy.\u201d\n\nDays later, another woman came forward to accuse Riff Raff of sexual misconduct. Kelsey Doucette alleged Riff Raff tried to coerce her into sex when she was just 17, during the Milwaukee stop of Warped Tour 2015.\n\nAfter getting the rapper\u2019s number during a meet-and-greet, Doucette told Jezebel that she was invited on to his tour bus, where he allegedly touched her forcefully before she managed to get away.\n\nDoucette tweeted about the incident at the time.\n\nPitchfork reports Doe\u2019s legal case now references these allegations, saying they make her alleged assault \u201cpart of a pattern of perversion preceded by multiple other undisclosed acts of perverted conduct and sexual assault of young women.\u201d\n\nPitchfork says the motion also cites another incident, an allegation by two women who accused the rapper of masturbating in front of them without their consent.\n\nWhen contacted by Pitchfork, Riff Raff\u2019s lawyer said in a statement, \u201cMr. Simco and his representatives take allegations of sexual misconduct very seriously. This case is set for a jury trial in May of 2019, and Mr. Simco looks forward to the opportunity to clear his name.\u201d", "description": "Allegation was tossed by police in 2014, but a civil suit remained open.
