L\u2019Or\u00e9al CEO Jean-Paul Agon told Barron\u2019s that the growth in makeup would \u2018\u2018reaccelerate\u2019\u2019 with new products and repositioning of brands. \u201cWe are doing everything to restimulate the market,\u201d he says about the U.S.\n\nOver the past five years, the maker of Maybelline, Garnier, and Lanc\u00f4me has been a stock market star, and strong growth in sales and profit helped lift the shares 96.2%, compared with a 53% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nIn July, the stock (ticker: OR:France) posted a 12.1% rise in half-year operating profit to 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion) on the back of a 10.6% increase in reported sales to \u20ac14.8 billion. The shares lost 4.1% on the day due to missing some forecasts, and have rebounded since to about \u20ac251.\n\nDespite the stock fetching a hefty 31 times this year\u2019s expected earnings, broker Mainfirst rated it Outperform in an August note, with a \u20ac270 price target, 7.5% ahead of the recent close. Mainfirst analyst Marion Boucheron wrote that L\u2019Or\u00e9al should continue to grow about twice as fast as most home- and personal-care players.\n\nShe forecasts a 33% increase in earnings before interest and taxes margin, which doesn\u2019t include exceptional costs, to \u20ac6.4 billion by 2021. Broker Liberum estimates a 29% rise to \u20ac6.2 billion of Ebit, but on an adjusted basis, due to better margins from innovations, and savings from the efficient use of digital advertising.\n\n\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al was founded in 1909 by Eugene Schueller, a French chemist of German descent, and went public in 1963. It has a market value of \u20ac141.9 billion and is geographically spread out over 130 countries with 86,000 employees. It has a 12% share of the \u20ac175 billion market and produces a wide range of branded skin care (31.8% of sales), makeup (27.4%), hair care and colorants (27.1%), and perfumes (9.3%), which are sold via four major divisions.\n\nEach division\u2014professional products, consumer products, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Luxe (upscale cosmetics and fragrances), and Active Cosmetics (skin-care and beauty products sold in health-care outlets)\u2014targets a different channel. The largest division, consumer products (44.1% of sales), focuses on the mass market.\n\nLast week, Agon appointed the boss of L\u2019Or\u00e9al China, St\u00e9phane Rinderknech, as president and CEO of L\u2019Or\u00e9al USA. \u201cWe really intend to bounce back in the U.S., but it may take some time,\u201d Agon says.\n\nPierre Tegner, an analyst at broker Oddo BHF, said that with new management, \u201cthe group has given itself the means to change the trend in North America.\u201d But North America isn\u2019t L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s biggest market; it contributes 25.7% of group sales. The leader is \u201cnew markets\u201d including Asia-Pacific, contributing 45.9% of group sales, and western Europe, at 28.4%.\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al looks to capitalize on demand for skin-care products and growth in e-commerce, especially in China. \u201cWe are perfectly on plan for this year for the group,\u2019\u2019 Agon says. \u201cThis first half is one of the best we have ever had.\u2019\u2019\n\nIf Agon is able to fix the blemish on its U.S. business, the stock will continue its stellar growth.", "description": "The French cosmetics giant has changed its top executive at the U.S. division.
