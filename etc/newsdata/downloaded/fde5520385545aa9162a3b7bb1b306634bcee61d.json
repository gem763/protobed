We as the community have only received letter instructing us to stay away from the river, which is a source of food,\u201d the memorandum said.\n\nCommunity representative Mzwa Goge said even councillors from the affected wards had not received a programme of action besides being instructed to tell residents to stay away from the river.\n\n\u201cThere are people that have been directly affected by what has happened. We only read about the incident in newspapers and saw it on TV, yet it affects us on a daily basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want the company to come up with an action plan that will bring relief to these residents.\u201d\n\nA resident who asked to remain unnamed, who makes about R900 on a good day from selling fish that he catches using a cast net, said he was becoming increasingly desperate.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t made a cent since the incident happened, and the only money now to feed his children comes from his mother\u2019s social grant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fishing since I was a little boy. I don\u2019t have a job, so this is how I support my children. People around here buy from me. I catch nice sizes and the fish sell fast,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. All I can do is wait for them to tell us the water is clean. That\u2019s why I came down here.\u201d\n\nFaye Brownell, of the Duzi-uMngeni Conservation Trust (Duct), said according to talks at a meeting they had with the Water and Sanitation Department, the water is still highly contaminated.\n\n\u201cThe officials have not had conclusive results,\u201d Brownell said.\n\nThobeka Mafumbatha, Msunduzi Municipality\u2019s spokesperson, said the clean-up at the river was ongoing.\n\n\u201cUpon completion of the clean-up, the watercourse and environs will need to be rehabilitated,\u201d she said.\n\nMafumbatha said although the pH levels in the Duzi River normalised after a few days, the river had been heavily contaminated for many years. \u201cE. coli monitoring in the city\u2019s tributaries has always been a concern, with results indicating extreme levels of contamination.\u201d\n\nWillowton Oil was asked to respond, but no response was received by late on Monday.", "description": "Residents from Sobantu, Eastwood, Cinderella Park, Madiba and Pavilion informal settlements staged a protest outside Willowton Oil Mills offices on Monday, following a massive effluent spill into the Duzi River last month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9337/29b27c19eb2841d48f49e6d45d8d9a18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
