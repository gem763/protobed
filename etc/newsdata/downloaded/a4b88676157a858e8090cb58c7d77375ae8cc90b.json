I don\u2019t know what anybody expected. This is Arsenal now. It\u2019s just lacklustre. There\u2019s no urgency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018People say they wouldn\u2019t know if this was Arsene Wenger\u2019s team, I don\u2019t know about that because defensively they looked comfortable. David Luiz just played in first gear.\n\n\u2018But going forward, they\u2019ve got no guile. It looked like Chris Wilder knew exactly what he wanted from his side. But with Arsenal and Unai Emery, it was almost like: \u201cSee you at half-time and full-time.\u201d\n\n\u2018I kept thinking: \u201cWhat would this Arsenal side look like if Chris Wilder was in charge?\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s accepted. Nobody is going to work this morning and saying: \u201cOh my God, did you see Arsenal getting beat by Sheffield United?\u201d\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Those days are gone. It\u2019s accepted through the club, the fans, the manager, everyone. Sheffield United played as much football as Arsenal, they didn\u2019t kick them off the pitch.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Arsenal legend added: \u2018What has improved [at Arsenal]? Really, what has improved? Not a lot, at all.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s nobody in that midfield who can open up a can. No matter how bad Arsenal are, everybody will come and sit 10 behind the ball against Arsenal, bar a couple of the big boys.\n\n\u2018Therefore you need special players in midfield to open things up. They haven\u2019t got that pass, that eye-of-the-needle pass.\n\n\u2018Even at the end, with four minutes to go, I\u2019m thinking: \u201cDo they know how long is left? I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an electric clock at Sheffield United, there was when I played there! Is there going to be a bit of urgency?\u201d\u2018\n\nArsenal, who are currently fifth in the Premier League, face Portuguese side Vitoria de Guimarae in the Europa League on Thursday night.\n\nMORE: Ian Wright speaks out on Bukayo Saka penalty incident against Sheffield United", "description": "Paul Merson has slammed Unai Emery's Arsenal and says nothing has changed since Arsene Wenger left the club.
