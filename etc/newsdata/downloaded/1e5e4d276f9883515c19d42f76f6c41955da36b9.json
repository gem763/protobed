And it proved a tipping point for the House speaker, who has long believed that impeachment could boomerang on the Democrats without ultimately ousting Trump, who she sees as highly vulnerable in 2020. But with 175 of her members, including some moderates, hopping on the impeachment bandwagon, Pelosi could no longer stem the tide.\n\nHOW TRUMP AND ALLIES ARE SHIFTING THE UKRAINE SPOTLIGHT TO BIDEN\n\nIn a flag-bedecked speech, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine \u201chave seriously violated the Constitution,\u201d that he \u201cmust be held accountable,\u201d and announcing an \u201cofficial\u201d investigation by a half-dozen committees.\n\nAs strange as it sounds, Pelosi\u2019s reluctant move could in some ways help Trump, because it shifts the terms of debate.\n\nTrump\u2019s preferred mode of defense is to go on offense\u2014whether it\u2019s against Crooked Hillary, Mueller\u2019s angry Democrats or Sleepy Joe\u2019s alleged transgressions. It\u2019s all about demonizing the other side, just as the left does to Trump.\n\nEspecially after his planned release today of a transcript of his July call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, the president and his allies can argue that even if he went too far in bringing up Joe Biden with a foreign leader, it does not warrant the drastic remedy of impeachment.\n\nHe\u2019s already called it \u201cwitch hunt garbage,\u201d and will undoubtedly cast it as one perpetrated by his enemies in the opposition party, the press and the Deep State. He can energize his supporters, who will see their hero in danger of being forced from office. And the resulting fireworks will not only obliterate any semblance of a Democratic agenda, it will overshadow what Biden, Bernie, Elizabeth and the rest are doing on the trail.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nTrump asked, not unreasonably, how Pelosi could take this step without even having seen the details of the phone call.\n\nOutside the hothouse of the media and political world, I don\u2019t sense that Ukraine has quite reached the level of a political earthquake. And that, for the moment, has the president\u2019s critics baffled.\n\nI believe the media coverage is a key factor, as I\u2019ll explain in a moment.\n\nBut first, there\u2019s no doubt that the Washington Post moved the ball with a report that Trump told his acting chief of staff \u201cto hold back almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine at least a week before a phone call in which Trump is said to have pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the son of former vice president Joe Biden, according to three senior administration officials.\u201d\n\nThe piece says that OMB officials relayed Trump\u2019s order to State and the Pentagon, and were ordered to give members of Congress no explanation beyond that the delay was part of an \u201cinteragency process.\u201d\n\nThe story also quoted Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy as saying that Ukrainian President Zelensky told him during a visit this month that the aid was cut off as a \u201cconsequence\u201d of his unwillingness to launch a probe of the Bidens. (The money has since been released.)\n\nThe president did not deny the story but shifted his explanation, saying he held up the money because he wanted Europe to pay more for Ukraine\u2019s defense. He also scoffed at the notion of impeachment before his speech at the U.N., telling reporters: \u201cWhat Joe Biden did for his son, that\u2019s something they should be looking at.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 Peter Baker reported yesterday morning that Trump now seems to be saying, as the headline puts it, \u201cSo What If I Did?\u201d\n\nThe piece calls this \u201can astonishing breach of the norms governing the American presidency\u2026If anything, the president has grown even more defiant since Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, almost as if having avoided charges, he is daring the establishment to come after him again. The man who once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan without consequence seems to be testing whether he can do the political equivalent.\u201d\n\nWith more House Democrats coming out for impeachment\u2014more than two-thirds of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s caucus is now in that camp\u2014the question of whether Ukraine is a dramatic tipping point looms large.\n\nMy sense is that there\u2019s a fatigue factor for Trump scandals. And besides the president and Rudy Giuliani trying to shift the spotlight to the Bidens, as I wrote yesterday, the media coverage of the last few years is coloring the current climate.\n\nTake the Bob Mueller probe. While I\u2019ve always argued the Russia investigation was a legitimately big story that led to several high-level indictments, can anyone really dispute that the coverage was so histrionic as to be misleading? The constant drumbeat was so relentless and so negative that it seemed only a matter of time before Trump was run out of town. Every minor development was cranked up to 11.\n\nAnd while the final report contained disturbing material, it also found no evidence that Trump actively cooperated with Russian operatives or hackers, and Mueller\u2019s halting testimony was the final nail in the coffin.\n\nWhen the media fixated for more than a week on Sharpie-gate\u2014and yes, Trump fueled the coverage with daily blasts about his handling of the hurricane\u2014it was another case of runaway hype.\n\nThe same was true in episode after episode: Porn stars! Michael Cohen! S-hole countries! Omarosa! Tax returns! Greenland! Go back where they came from! Rat-infested Baltimore!\n\nMost of these controversies were very real, sometimes troubling, and yet trumpeted with a this-time-he\u2019s-gone-too-far tone until each story faded. Trump\u2019s constant pushback against the \u201cfake news media,\u201d and his attacks on Democrats and \u201cwitch hunt\u201d investigators, added to the feeling that these were nothing more than partisan brawls.\n\nIn other words, journalists are suffering from boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome. Now that they have extremely serious allegations to pursue, the ensuing uproar sounds too much like so many other scandals and mini-scandals that, fairly or unfairly, didn\u2019t move the needle.\n\nThere\u2019s also an emerging theory, argued for some time by the Federalist\u2019s Ben Domenech, that Trump wants to be impeached.\n\nRoss Douthat, the conservative, anti-Trump New York Times columnist, expanded on this view yesterday:\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats impeach him they will be doing something unpopular instead of something popular\u2026 the likely Democratic nominees are all more popular than Trump, and so anything that puts the Democrats on the wrong side of public opinion may look better, through Trump\u2019s eyes, than the status quo\u2026\n\n\u201cTrump is happy to pit his overt abuses of power against the soft corruption of his foes. This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president\u2019s critics find particularly infuriating \u2014 the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself.\u201d\n\nWhether or not you agree that he did something wrong, he excels at these dual-corruption debates, that it\u2019s the other side that should face prison terms.\n\nNo president, not even Donald Trump, wants to be impeached. But if past journalistic excesses help convince the public that the Ukraine story is just more exaggeration, and if the press is viewed as a pro-impeachment movement, Trump will paint the media as helping the Democrats try to end his term.", "description": "With Nancy Pelosi finally bowing to Democratic pressure and launching a formal impeachment inquiry, many in the media may be getting their wish.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/24/694940094001_6089133591001_6089129333001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
