All of that stuff is historically atypical.\u201d\n\nSen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) disagreed, arguing that Republicans got what they wanted and should declare victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the House has responded, and they're going to have transparent proceedings,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve wanted to see.\u201d\n\nThe conflict underscores how Senate Republicans have struggled to unite on a response to the House\u2019s fast-moving impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, which centers on his alleged efforts to withhold military aide to Ukraine without securing an investigation into his political rivals like Joe Biden.\n\nIn fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell never committed to a floor vote on the measure in the first place.\n\nThe resolution, introduced last week by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and McConnell, came after Trump complained that Republicans were not doing enough to defend him on impeachment.\n\nThe nonbinding Senate resolution would call for the House to hold a vote to open the impeachment inquiry, provide Trump with \u201cdue process\u201d and give House Republicans subpoena power.\n\nThe measure now has support from 50 of the 53 Senate Republicans, with Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) the holdouts.\n\nAnd Trump has been positively ebullient about the new defense effort.\n\n....in the basement of the United States Capitol! They cannot win at the ballot box. Their sham for the past 3 years continues. The good news is that the American People get it, which will be proven once again on November 3, 2020! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2019\n\n\"I appreciate the support of [Graham and McConnell] and their Great Senate Republican colleagues, on the resolution condemning the Do Nothing Democrats for their Witch Hunt Impeachment inquiry, behind closed doors....in the basement of the United States Capitol!\u201d Trump tweeted on Friday after Graham introduced the resolution.\n\nRepublicans have focused their impeachment complaints on the House\u2019s impeachment process, lambasting closed-door hearings and the leaking of testimony from key witnesses. But the planned House vote this week \u2014 which signals a move into a more public phase \u2014 could put those complaints to rest.\n\nGraham, a close Trump apply, credited himself and his colleagues for \u201cmaking the House [Democrats\u2019] position untenable.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming response House Democrats heard from the American people and Senate Republicans in support of my resolution forced their hand,\u201d Graham said in a statement after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced this week\u2019s vote.\n\nBut McConnell never promised to hold a vote of his own.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican notably referred the resolution to the Senate Rules Committee rather than bringing it directly to the floor.\n\nWhile that follows the Senate\u2019s regular order process, it also could be shelved there for weeks before it sees a committee vote. After that, the resolution could be tied up on the Senate floor if Democrats force procedural votes, which seems likely. And while a vote on the Senate resolution could show the president that Republicans are standing up for him, it also could take limited floor time away from other priorities like funding the government and confirming more judicial nominees.\n\nSenate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said whether his committee takes action on the Senate resolution depends on how Pelosi\u2019s move this week plays out.\n\n\u201cI read her letter and it could mean not very much or maybe it will be more than \u2018we\u2019re just going to formalize the unfair way we\u2019ve been doing things,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt does mean we should see what she says.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s resolution had an uncertain launch at first, as more than a dozen Republicans didn\u2019t initially co-sponsor the resolution. But support quickly built within the GOP on Thursday and Friday, so that only the three Republicans have not endorsed it.\n\n\u201cI read her letter and it could mean not very much or maybe it will be more than \u2018we\u2019re just going to formalize the unfair way we\u2019ve been doing things.' It does mean we should see what she says.\u201d - Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)\n\nAnd Collins said Monday that she did not plan to co-sponsor the resolution. She added that she has not yet decided on whether she would vote for it if it came to the floor.\n\n\u201cI have been critical of the House not holding a vote to authorize the inquiry, but the House determines its own procedures,\u201d Collins said. \u201cJust as I don\u2019t like it when House members try to tell us to abolish the filibuster, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s productive for the Senate to try to dictate to the House how to conduct the inquiry.\u201d\n\nRomney said in an interview Monday that he would look at the resolution but noted that may no longer be necessary.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning I've been reluctant to weigh in on process, and it looks like Speaker Pelosi has scheduled a vote so that may be overtaken by events,\" Romney said.\n\nSeveral senators reiterated that the decision to bring the resolution up to a vote rests with McConnell.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be entirely up to the leader at this point,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019d asked me this morning I\u2019d say yes,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on whether the Senate should vote on the Graham-McConnell resolution. \u201cNow with Pelosi announcing that they\u2019re going to take a vote in the House I think that may factor in... That\u2019s something.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Senate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt", "R-Mo."], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ad/ee/ed2d97c2449780b415f8f9af93b7/191028-collins-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
