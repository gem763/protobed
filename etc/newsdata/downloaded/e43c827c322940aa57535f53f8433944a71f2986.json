As an example, the report says 42 percent of storage objects measured with recorded DLP incidents were misconfigured.\n\nCNET: Amazon looks to expand Alexa's world amid growing privacy concerns\n\nThe report says that the top ten most commonly-misconfigured settings in AWS, the most popular IaaS provider for enterprise firms alongside Microsoft Azure, are as below:\n\nEBS Data Encryption\n\nUnrestricted Outbound Access\n\nEC2 Security Group Port Config\n\nProvisioning Access to Resources using IAM Roles\n\nUnrestricted Access to Non-Http/Https ports\n\nUnrestricted Inbound Access on Uncommon Ports\n\nUnused Security Groups\n\nUnrestricted ICMP Access\n\nEC2 Security Group Inbound Access Configuration\n\nEC2 Instance Belongs to a VPC\n\nClose to a quarter of survey respondents admitted it can take longer than 24 hours to correct reported misconfigurations, and in some serious cases, fixes can take over a month.\n\nTechRepublic: Governments still struggling to contend with weaponized social media platforms\n\n\"In the rush toward IaaS adoption, many organizations overlook the shared responsibility model for the cloud and assume that security is taken care of completely by the cloud provider,\" said Rajiv Gupta, senior vice president of Cloud Security at McAfee. \"However, the security of what customers put in the cloud, most importantly sensitive data, is their responsibility.\"\n\nAccording to research agency Gartner, the worldwide public cloud services market is expected to grow by 17.5 percent over 2019, reaching $214.3 billion. The IaaS segment is predicted to experience the strongest and quickest growth, climbing 27.5 percent to be worth $38.9 billion, up from $30.5 billion in 2018.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
