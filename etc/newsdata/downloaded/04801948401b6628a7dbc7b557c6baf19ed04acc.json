Though medication may be the right choice for other women in my position, I chose instead to work with my therapist to shift my perspective on what emotions I \u201cshould\u201d be feeling during pregnancy. I chose to give myself permission to go through matrescence, which like my own adolescence 20 years earlier, proved to be a time both thrilling and fraught.\n\nWhen it comes to pregnancy, society has, as Grose told me, \u201ca moral halo around anything construed as natural.\u201d This might lead people to believe that there is a right way to be pregnant, or that there is a script for a normal pregnancy. But \u201cthere\u2019s a wide range of normal that nobody knows about,\u201d Birndorf told me.\n\n\u201cHow distressed are you by these thoughts and feelings that you\u2019re having?\u201d she asks women to consider. \u201cHow much is it impacting your functioning? How much is it changing how you move through the world? If those answers to those questions are \u2018a lot,\u2019 then you\u2019re talking about something else.\u201d\n\nNormal or natural pregnancy for me, I came to realize, involved the same mild depression I\u2019d been living with for years. The more I looked at my feelings\u2014with the support of my therapist and my husband; in a daily journaling practice; sometimes with friends\u2014the more it helped to think of myself as going through \u201cmatrescence.\u201d I was never diagnosed with prenatal depression, perhaps because my depression was not, and will not, be confined to pregnancy. My therapist helped me to acknowledge the fear, the ambivalence, and the profound change that becoming a mother entails. Maybe pregnancy was a chance for me to transform my relationship with depression, with control, and with my body, he offered; maybe I would meet this challenge and give birth to two new people in the fall.\n\nI did not expect that being depressed during pregnancy could lead to wellness, but 10 days from this writing, when I meet my son, I\u2019ll do so knowing that I\u2019m as healthy as I\u2019ve ever been in my life, with greater self-awareness, a firmer grip on my own coping skills, and a clearer voice with which to reach out. \u201cIf you can figure out how to help yourself or get the help you need during your pregnancy, you may not end up with a postpartum problem, because you\u2019ve dealt with it during pregnancy,\u201d Birndorf said. If pregnancy is a time to prepare for the arrival of a new life, I\u2019ve done all I can.", "description": "For many people, pregnancy can be one of the most emotionally taxing experiences of their lives.", "authors": ["Joanna Novak"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/finish/facebook.jpg?1571692005", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
