This was not because she did not think Trump\u2019s behaviour in regard to Russian interference, or his attempt to derail Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible obstruction of justice, merited it.\n\nRather, her calculation was solely made on the grounds of how this would play out for the party in 2020, and she feared it would be damaging. There was little public support, polls told her, for another lengthy, drawn-out investigation of the president.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Revelations about Trump\u2019s 25 July phonecall to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky when he asked him to investigate Joe Biden and his son \u2013 two days after Mueller testified before Congress \u2013 struck a chord with many.\n\nHow could Trump be so brazen as to narrowly escape censure over Russia\u2019s actions in 2016, only to then seek help from another eastern European capital in regard to the 2020 showdown?\n\nThat was an argument the public could understand, Pelosi figured, and she ordered six House committees to focus on Trump\u2019s actions under an impeachment umbrella. Those committees are likely to see not only the transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky, but hear directly from the US intelligence official who first drew attention to what they considered an inappropriate conversation.\n\n\u201cSecretary of state Pompeo, received permission from Ukraine government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their president,\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday evening. \u201cThey don\u2019t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!\u201d\n\nIn triggering the impeachment inquiry, Pelosi has taken the US onto rarely trodden ground. And while she can control the actions of her committee chairs, she is gambling as to how Trump and his supporters will respond.\n\nWill they dig up fresh dirt on Biden and his son? If so, will it stick? Will it hurt his chances as Democrats prepare to select a presidential challenger to Trump? Will Republicans strand by the president, or will more \u2013 perhaps the likes of John Kasich or even Nikki Haley \u2013 feel emboldened enough to mount a serious primary challenge to him?\n\n\u201cSpeaker Pelosi happens to be the speaker of this House but she does not speak for America when it comes to this issue,\u201d said House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. \u201cThis election is over. It\u2019s time to put the public before politics.\u201d\n\nWhat is certain is that what was already set to be an ugly 2020 contest, will now be dragged down right into the mud.\n\nPelosi reckons the trade off is worth it, and she is banking on the American public thinking so too.", "description": "Lots of people would like to ask Nancy Pelosi one simple question: what took you so long?", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/19/pelosi-gamble.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
