Yet, according to CNN they don't like the label of 'influencer'.\n\nThey have, however, come under fire in the past for their risky photographic techniques - in particular a snap of Kody dangling Kelly over the edge of a swimming pool in Bali. But the couple says that they use tricks of the photographic trade to create these seemingly death-defying illusions - i.e. it's all in the angle, it's a perspective shot.\n\nREAD: Never Instagram or share your boarding pass on social media - here's why\n\nThey want to convey 'trust' in their pictures, and use bold techniques to achieve this.

Flashing your bum in famous places is now a social media trend (NSFW)\n\nThis particular couple said that the train was moving super slow at the time they snapped this pic, but still...\n\nBut these guys won't stop just because a few people complained, that's for sure. They'll continue to push boundaries to make bank.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
