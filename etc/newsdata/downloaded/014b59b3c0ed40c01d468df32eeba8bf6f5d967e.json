The government and the UK aviation watchdog are preparing to launch a rescue plan codenamed Operation Matterhorn.\n\nThe foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said the government had contingency plans in place for passengers in case rescue talks failed, and sought to reassure holidaymakers that they will not end up stuck overseas. However, he downplayed the prospect of a government bailout for the firm.\n\nThomas Cook: planes put on standby to rescue travellers as talks go to wire Read more\n\n\u201cWe would wait to see and hope that [Thomas Cook] can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we\u2019ve got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded,\u201d Raab told the BBC.\n\nThe last-ditch meeting was taking place at a City law firm, where participants included Thomas Cook\u2019s creditors and its biggest shareholder, Chinese conglomerate Fosun. It came as holidaymakers at a hotel in Tunisia reported being locked in by security guards as the hotel demanded extra money, fearing it would not be paid by Thomas Cook.\n\nThomas Cook continued to reassure worried customers on Saturday night that their flights continue to operate as normal and all their package holidays are protected under the Atol scheme, which guarantees holidaymakers\u2019 bookings.\n\nHowever, tourists at the Les Orangers beach resort in the town of Hammamet, near Tunis, said their hotel was refusing to let guests leave while demanding extra money.\n\nQuick guide The history of Thomas Cook Show Hide Thomas Cook owes its name to a humble and deeply religious 32-year-old cabinet-maker who, one June morning in 1841, hiked the 15 miles from his home in Market Harborough to Leicester, to attend a temperance meeting. The former Baptist preacher believed that the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol and, presumably fatigued from his walk, realised he could deploy the power of Britain\u2019s flourishing rail network to help spread the word. Addressing the temperance meeting, he suggested that a train be hired to carry the movement\u2019s supporters to the next meeting in Loughborough. Thus, on 5 July 1841, some 500 passengers travelled by a special train for the 24-mile round trip, paying a shilling apiece. Over the next few years, Cook laid on ever more trains, introducing thousands of Britons to train travel for the first time. The first such outing to be run for commercial purposes was a trip to Liverpool in 1845. Over the next decade or so, the business expanded to offer overseas trips, to France, Switzerland, Italy and beyond, to the US, Egypt and India. His more business-minded son John expanded the tour operator and its reach was such that the government enlisted its expertise in an effort, ultimately in vain, to relieve General Gordon at the siege of Khartoum in 1885. John\u2019s three sons inherited the business, which incorporated as Thos Cook & Son Ltd in 1924 and benefited from the increasing ease of international travel. Its first flirtation with collapse came during the second world war, when the government requisitioned some of its assets and it was sold to Britain\u2019s railway companies, effectively a nationalisation. But it boomed in the postwar years as growing prosperity fuelled the appetite for holidays and it returned to private ownership in 1972. Since then, it has changed hands and changed shape via a series of mergers and takeovers. It nearly collapsed in 2011 but averted its demise with a bailout deal funded by banks. Now, after 178 years of operation, it is relying on its largest shareholder \u2013 the Chinese conglomerate Fosun \u2013 to survive.\n\nRyan Farmer, from Leicestershire, told BBC Radio Five\u2019s Stephen Nolan show the hotel had on Saturday afternoon summoned all guests who were due to leave to go to reception \u201cto pay additional fees, obviously because of the situation with Thomas Cook\u201d.\n\nWith many tourists refusing pay on the grounds they had already paid Thomas Cook, security guards were keeping the hotel\u2019s gates shut, refusing to allow guests out, or to let new visitors enter.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t leave the hotel. I\u2019d describe it as exactly the same as being held hostage,\u201d Mr Farmer said.\n\nHoliday nightmare: big debts and bad luck push Thomas Cook to the brink Read more\n\nThe Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), which represents workers at the company, said the British government should be ready to assist with \u201creal financial support\u201d.\n\nGeneral secretary Manuel Cortes called for an urgent meeting with the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom. However, a government financial rescue is thought highly unlikely.\n\nCortes said in a letter: \u201cIt is incumbent upon the government to act if required and save this iconic cornerstone of the British high street and the thousands of jobs that go with it.\u201d\n\nThe shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, said: \u201cThis is yet more evidence of this government\u2019s indifference to British jobs and businesses going under. All viable options must be explored by Thomas Cook and the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis.\u201d\n\nIt is understood that Thomas Cook has approached the British government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding.\n\nA government spokesman said: \u201cWe recognise it\u2019s a worrying time for holidaymakers and employees.\n\n\u201cThe financial circumstances of individual businesses are a commercial matter, but the government and the Civil Aviation Authority are monitoring the situation closely.\u201d", "description": "Up to 150,000 UK holidaymakers affected with 9,000 British jobs at risk as firm looks for \u00a3200m in funds", "authors": ["Simon Goodley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbefc3d486ca0712e8acebb2494b3bfa3a190c87/0_263_2627_1576/master/2627.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af9b969664793e84e9442081fb038dce", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
