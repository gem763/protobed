There is no research to support the common misconception that the maximum age gap is half your age plus seven. However, research does show that the bigger the age gap the more difficulties a couple will face and the greater the risk of divorce. That risk decreases the older we get, as our experiences, life stages, goals, and resources become more aligned.\n\n'When it comes to love there's no magic formula, relationships are as unique as the people in them, however couples with large age gaps do face a unique set of challenges that can put their relationship at risk,' she told FEMAIL.\n\nThese include dealing with social disapproval - mainly because individuals believe the younger lover is 'exploiting' the older partner - being at different life stages and not being able to relate to each other's friends and peers.\n\n'Couples at different life stages also experience differences in financial and career stability and this can have an impact on the relationship,' Ms Loisel said.\n\nIf the pairing has contrasting values and interests this can put a strain on their love, however this can be a problem faced by any couple.\n\nWhat you do need to be mindful of in a large age-gap relationship is that children from previous marriages can feel 'uncomfortable', particularly if a partner is of a similar age to them.\n\nOn average a man prefers to partner with a woman three years their junior and for women it's three years their senior.\n\nWhile most people are happy to explore different age ranges, this doesn't always work long term.\n\nSome of the major 'warning signs' to look for if you enter into a relationship with an older or younger partner is someone trying to 'hide' that they are in a relationship, they're critical of your friends, many of your closest family members disapprove, they are trying to control or change you in any way or you're not on the same page in terms of life goals and commitment.\n\nIf you're finding it difficult to detect any red flags, it might be easier to note their body language to decipher whether they are 'The One' for you.\n\nThe pair have sent 'shockwaves' through the court precinct as a result of their impending nuptials\n\nWhat are some of the major warning signs to watch out for? * You're not on equal footing and one partner has more power in the relationship. * One of you wants to hide your relationship from friends and family. * They're critical of your friends and peer group. * They're not on the same page as you in terms of life goals, children and commitment. * Their friends and family don't approve of your relationship. * They show signs of trying to control you and the relationship, be it emotionally, financially or socially. * They try and change you.\n\n'Our non-verbal communication and body language reflects how we feel and can reveal resentment, disapproval, and contempt, and waning love if we look closely enough,' Ms Loisel said.\n\nWe subconsciously move closer to people we are happy to be around and away from those who are making us feel uncomfortable.\n\n'Keep an eye out for a signs of distancing and blocking including moving their torso and feet away from you, averted gaze, hand to face gestures (including partial hand over the mouth), hidden palms and disappearing legs,' she said.\n\nLip biting is a subconscious response to stress and anxiety - a fairly reliable indication that something might be wrong.\n\nCouples with large age-gaps can struggle with being at different life stages\n\nAs is crossing your legs, fidgeting, wringing your hands out and twisting your feet around a leg chair.\n\nWhile sometimes our bodies can be difficult to read, if any of the queues are noticeable it might be time to have a conversation about how either partner is feeling.\n\nFor those who are currently in a large age-gap relationship, Ms Loisel has some simple advice.\n\n'Be very honest about your life goals and what you want from the relationship and from life,' she said.\n\n'Age-gap relationships can be taxing, so nurture your support network and friendships, they will be your lifeline.'", "description": "An Australian relationship and body language expert has revealed whether couples with large age-gap ever have a chance of lasting long term.", "authors": ["Matilda Rudd", "Laura House For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/00/19516268-0-image-a-11_1570662667879.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
