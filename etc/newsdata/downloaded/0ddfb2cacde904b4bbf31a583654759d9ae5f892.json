Fuel oil, which can be used instead of crude for power generation, has also been bought. Exports of naphtha -- a building-block product for making gasoline and plastics -- have also been disrupted.\n\nWhile the kingdom does import fuels from time to time anyway, traders say the scale of its current purchasing is well above normal. On Saturday, vital oil-production facilities at Abqaiq were attacked, resulting in a temporary halt to a large swath of the nation\u2019s output capacity. To keep crude flowing to customers, Saudi Arabia cut processing at its own refineries by 1 million barrels a day, and stepped up fuel imports.\n\n\u201cIf you take off a good portion of Middle Eastern refinery capacity then there\u2019s a void in the market and it needs to be filled,\u201d Eugene Lindell, head of downstream analysis at JBC Energy GmbH, said by phone. \u201cLuckily, we just happen to have ramping up of Asian capacity -- particularly in China -- and that will help fill the void.\u201d\n\nAramco purchased cargoes of diesel early this week. The company was also seeking to defer some supplies of naphtha to its customers, according to a buyer who received such a request from Aramco. Separately, it was also seeking spot supplies of jet fuel, according to traders who buy and sell the aviation oil. Aramco also bought at least two high-sulfur fuel oil cargoes, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nGasoline?\n\nAlthough there were no signs of Aramco Trading buying gasoline, there have been indications that more of the fuel could flow to the region. Since Friday, several tankers have been booked to ship the fuel from northwest Europe to the Middle East on what would be a relatively rare trade route.\n\nThey may not end up there since all have options to sail to Singapore. It\u2019s also hard to say whether those charters would be a consequence of the weekend attacks, especially as U.S. imports from Europe have fallen of late, suggesting cargoes from the continent may be looking for a new home anyway.\n\nSaudi Aramco declined to comment.\n\nRead: Saudis May Curb LPG Cargoes in Wake of Attacks, Affecting China\n\nThe flurry of demand supported prices in Asia where the cost of naphtha for immediate supply surged over later-loading shipments. The spread known as backwardation, a key indicator of physical supply and demand balances, strengthened to $12.50 a ton, its highest in more than five years, on Tuesday. It was at $6 backwardation as of 7:24 a.m. in London.\n\nThe premium of prompt jet fuel supplies in the region\u2019s trading hub of Singapore also surged to its highest since April 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Europe\u2019s jet fuel market has strengthened since Friday, with stronger premiums to both Brent crude and ICE gasoil seen in the forward market.\n\nIn Singapore, the world\u2019s largest marine fueling hub, high-sulfur fuel oil forward markets showed the product rocketing as measured against Dubai crude in the days after the attack, with the same dynamic seen in Europe. One of the attack\u2019s consequences is that Saudi Arabia is likely to burn more fuel oil in its power generation plants, according to analysts.\n\nSaudi Arabia has become an increasingly important refining center in recent years as the nation tries to maximize the value of its oil. The kingdom processed about 2.8 million barrels a day last year, according to data from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That\u2019s more than any individual European nation, and makes it the seventh-largest oil processor in the world.\n\nStepping up imports is unavoidable for the time being, said Olivier Jakob, managing director at consultants Petromatrix GmbH in Zug, Switzerland.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be otherwise as they are trimming refinery runs to maintain some crude exports,\u201d he said.\n\n(Updates with Saudi Aramco responses in eighth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Prejula Prem and Andrew Janes.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Heesu Lee in Seoul at hlee425@bloomberg.net;Jack Wittels in London at jwittels1@bloomberg.net;Saket Sundria in Singapore at ssundria@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaric Nightingale at anightingal1@bloomberg.net, ;Serene Cheong at scheong20@bloomberg.net, Brian Wingfield\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest crude exporter and a powerhouse of the oil refining industry, is scouring global fuel markets for cargoes in the wake of unprecedented attacks on its energy industry.Aramco Trading Co., which buys and sells fuels on behalf of the state oil company, purchased", "authors": ["Heesu Lee", "Jack Wittels", "Saket Sundria"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SocWD8JbXVvVZhs2Cxc0cw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/1d7739f0348f93950646392c23fa6581", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
