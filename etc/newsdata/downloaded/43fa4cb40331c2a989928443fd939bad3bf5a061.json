Office tends to be more cyclical in a downturn and that's because tenants tend to be businesses and so in a struggling economy, they cut back staff and they don't need as much office space,\" Mrs Kumaru said.\n\n\"In multifamily what you tend to find is that it is more defensive in down markets and that's because people need somewhere to live, so if you're in a good location, particularly in the city, it creates a closer, cheaper option and the income can tend to be more stable in down markets.\"\n\nMrs Kumaru added that while QSuper would like to increase its exposure to BTR, every decision was assessed on a risk-adjusted return basis.\n\n\"Historically, we've found it challenging to buy these assets at an appropriate risk-adjusted returns relative to the other investments that we had been shown.\"", "description": "Eagerness among institutional investors to focus on defensive property assets in an uncertain economic environment is pushing Australian capital into build-to-rent projects in the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1506%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_23/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b629b854dc79ba093b1a5daefd5f1f8ea2542b4b", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
