They outshot Buffalo 44-18.\n\nJoonas Korpisalo had 15 saves for Columbus.\n\nMarcus Johansson and Jeff Skinner also scored for Buffalo and Ullmark, making his first start of the season, had 40 saves.\n\nBjorkstrand, playing in his 200th NHL game, got his first goal of the season with 1:51 left in the first when he grabbed a carom off the back boards and shot from a sharp angle, bouncing the puck in off Ullmark's back.\n\nThe Blue Jackets struck again quickly when Atkinson \u2014 just 9 seconds into a power play \u2014 scored from the bottom of the right circle off a sharp behind-the-net feed from Alexander Wennberg.\n\nEarly in the second period, it was Buffalo's turn to capitalize on a power play. Johansson, signed as an unrestricted free agent in the summer, got his first goal with the Sabres on a one-timer from the right circle to cut Columbus' lead to 2-1.\n\nSkinner tied the score for Buffalo later in the second when he picked Ryan Murray's pocket in the defensive zone on the Blue Jackets' transition and rifled a shot past Korpisalo from 30 feet.\n\nFoligno batted in a bouncing puck amid heavy traffic to give Columbus the lead again on a power play 6:46 into the third.\n\nNOTES: Columbus F Sonny Milano replaced Josh Anderson, who was injured Saturday in a 7-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. ... Blue Jackets D Markus Nutivaara replaced Dean Kukan after being a healthy scratch Saturday. ... Columbus rookie F Emil Bemstrom got his first NHL point with an assist on Foligno's goal.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSabres: Host Montreal on Wednesday night.\n\nBlue Jackets: Host Anaheim on Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mitchstacy\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
