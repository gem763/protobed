Tesla CEO Elon Musk kicked off the call with some explanatory remarks on the V3 Solar Roof, and then took a number of questions. The company says it\u2019ll begin installations in the coming weeks (Musk says some installations have already begun) and that it hopes to ramp production to as many as 1,000 new roofs per week.\n\nTesla\u2019s solar roof tiles \u2014 which are designed to look just like normal roof tiles when installed on a house, while doubling as solar panels to generate power \u2014 are something of a work-in-progress. The company is still tinkering with the product three years after announcing the concept, having done trial installations with two different iterations so far. \u201cVersions one and two we were still figuring things out,\u201d said Elon Musk on an earnings call earlier this week, adding that he thinks \u201cversion three is finally ready for the big time.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s Solar Roof website now includes a pricing estimator, which lists $42,500 as the total price for the average 2,000 square-foot home, with 10kW solar panels. It also lists $33,950 as the price after an $8,550 federal tax incentive. You can also enter your address and get an updated estimate that takes into account local costs and incentives, and add on any Powerwalls (with three as the default for a 2,000 square-foot roof).\n\n\u201cThe solarglass roof is not going to make financial sense for somebody who has a relatively new roof, because this is itself a roof, that has integrated solar power generation,\u201d Musk explained. He went on to note that Tesla has managed with this version three product to achieve a price point that is \u201cless than what the average roof costs, plus the solar panels\u201d that you would add on top of said roof.\n\n\u201cFiguring out how to install it effectively is very non-trivial. And we\u2019re actually going to have [\u2026] \u2018installathons,\u2019 \u201d Musk said, which will pit two teams against each other to see who can roof one of two similar-sized/designed roofs faster. Musk reiterated later that there\u2019s \u201cquite a bit of R&D just in the installation process itself.\u201d\n\nMusk also said that while it\u2019s hiring and training specialized installers at first, the plan is to ultimately expand installations to any third-party contractors as well. On the call, he and the Tesla team discussed how they focused on getting the installation time down to where it\u2019s faster than installing traditional shingles, plus solar panels on top of that. Musk added that his ultimate goal is to install the solar glass tiles even faster than comparative shingles. This is a significant change from version two of the solar roof, Musk later said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing installations as fast as we possibly can, starting in the next few weeks,\u201d Musk said about availability, adding that the goal is to \u201cget to 1,000 roofs per week\u201d sometime in \u201cthe next several months.\u201d\n\nA report from CNBC from September 2018 found that Tesla still hadn\u2019t performed many actual installations of its solar roof tile, despite the two-year gap between announcement and the date of their investigation, and a January announcement about the initiation of solar roof tile production at Tesla\u2019s Buffalo-based Gigafactory. During the company\u2019s annual general shareholder meeting in June, Musk said that the third iteration of the tile was being worked on, and while he didn\u2019t detail the actual number of installations, he did say that they were in progress in eight different states across the U.S. at that point.\n\nMusk addressed some of the production delays to date, addressing the installation complexity of previous generations, but also citing the Tesla Model 3 production ramp, which he said \u201creally stripped resources from solar for a year or a year-and-a-half.\u201d Now that Model 3 production is in a good place, Musk said that that has unblocked significantly some of the company\u2019s ability to focus on this challenge.\n\nThe total addressable market that Musk sees for this product is somewhere on the order of 100 million houses worldwide, and Musk stressed that the company does indeed intend to make this available worldwide.\n\nWhile at launch there will be only one available look for the Solar Roof, the Tesla CEO also said that the company will roll out additional variants as quickly as it can, including tiles that resemble clay and other alternatives.\n\nThe tiles and roof installation carry a warranty of 25 years, which includes their protective weatherization (including 130 MPH wind resistance) and their power generation capability. On balance, the Solar Roof provides more energy generation than a similarly sized roof retrofitted with traditional tiles, though individually, the tile\u2019s power-gathering cells themselves are less energy-efficient than a traditional solar cell. The Solar Roof is better performing, however, because it covers more surface area of a home.", "description": "Tesla has launched the third iteration of its solar roof tile for residential home use, which it officially detailed in a blog post on Friday and in a call with media.
