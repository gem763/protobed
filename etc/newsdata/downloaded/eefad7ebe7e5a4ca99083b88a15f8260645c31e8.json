The second-half was a horror show, with Serge Gnabry, the former Arsenal winger, scoring four times as Bayern ran riot. The German champions twisted the knife with three goals in the final seven minutes.\n\nPochettino kept his players inside the dressing-room for some time after the final whistle but when he emerged, he stressed that calm analysis had to be the order of a traumatic evening. His message was that he and the players needed to accept the defeat and deal with the consequences.\n\n\u201cThe feeling at the end when we conceded the three goals \u2013 it was like the team was tired and gave up a little bit,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cMaybe that showed a little bit our frustration with the game because up until 82 minutes, the team were alive, we were fighting, trying to create chances to score [for 4-3].\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cI told you many weeks ago that this is going to be a tough season. After the final of the Champions League last season [when Spurs lost to Liverpool], it was a chapter closed and now the club is in a period when they need to open another chapter and decide a project \u2013 medium, long-term. You need to show your quality like a man first; to face [the defeat] like a professional, like a man. What comes after is the professional side. Now we need to be men and be strong all together; try to bounce back and change the feeling.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mauricio Pochettino blows out his cheeks during an awful night for Tottenham Hotspur.

We are so disappointed. I feel so bad because when you concede seven goals it is tough.\n\n\u201cBut you need to face up to this type of situation. When you play the final of the Champions League, it was nice to put your face up after the wins we had at Manchester City and Ajax. Now I have to put my same face up and accept we were not as good as we expected.\u201d\n\nIrresistible Gnabry shreds Spurs after Lewandowski\u2019s decisive incision | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nSpurs have won only three of 10 matches in all competitions this season and, joint-bottom of Champions League Group B with Olympiakos, they face an uphill battle to qualify for the last 16 with back-to-back games against Red Star Belgrade up next.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to talk now,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI said nothing [to the players]. It\u2019s a situation where we have to be calm first. We will talk tomorrow. We are not going to fix anything by shouting; when the emotion is on the skin. It\u2019s more psychological now. To try to move on and no damage between us.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, after 30 minutes or the first-half, it was my best feeling managing the team this season. It is so difficult to accept how the feeling changed in the second-half. Nobody in that stadium expected this type of result in the end. It was a little bit of a strange game.\u201d", "description": "Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham gave up towards the end of their 7-2 Champions League mauling by Bayern Munich", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0cdc47127b6a044a176541ac4c4d9ba78dcb974/374_538_4109_2466/master/4109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0c5b537d795d699041ac26c35402136", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
