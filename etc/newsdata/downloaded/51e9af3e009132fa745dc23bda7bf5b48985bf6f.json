I don\u2019t recognise my country. What is going on? Absolutely horrible.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"People just trying to get to work for goodness sake. On the train which is electric anyway. I just don\u2019t understand. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me.\"\n\nLorraine admitted she does understand where the protesters are coming from but criticised their methods.\n\nThe climate change protesters were trying to paralyse the London Underground network by halting the Jubilee Line and unfurling a banner which read: \"Business as usual = death\".\n\n(Image: mahatir_pasha/Twitter)\n\nLorraine said: \"I think all of us have sympathy people for what they\u2019re trying to do. And then it's the way they\u2019re going about it is just so toxic and divisive.\n\n\"Someone's going to get killed. It's absolutely nuts.\"\n\nThe British Transport police says four arrests have been made and there has been a strong police presence on the tube network.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEarlier on Good Morning Britain, the presenters spoke on the phone to Mahatir Pasha, who recorded the shocking footage of a protester being hauled off the top of a train.\n\nHe said: \"A lot of people around were [scared]. I saw one lady crying. She was visibly traumatised. A lot of people round there were shocked.\"\n\n*Lorraine airs weekdays on ITV at 8.30am", "description": "The much-loved presenter admitted she doesn't recognise her country after protesters climbed on top of a train at Canning Town station", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Mahatir_Pasha Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639372.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RLP_MDG_18674JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
