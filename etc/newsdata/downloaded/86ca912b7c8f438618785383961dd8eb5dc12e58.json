Sivan, head of the Indian Space Research Organization, told the news agency ANI that the mission\u2019s orbiter had clicked a thermal image of the lander from its cameras. \u201cWe are trying to establish contact. It will be communicated soon,\u201d he said.\n\nVikram, the lander of Chandrayaan-2, which blasted off in July, was scheduled to soft-land on the lunar south pole early Saturday. While its descent began as planned, communication with it snapped minutes before touchdown, leading to heartbreak across the nation.\n\nAn emotional Sivan was hugged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In his address to the nation, Modi told the space agency that the entire country was proud of it. Support for the scientists leading India\u2019s ambitious but scrappy space exploration efforts poured in from across the world. \u201cYou have inspired us,\u201d NASA said in a tweet commending the Indian space agency\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe multiple payloads abroad Chandrayaan-2 for conducting scientific experiments included a NASA payload. India had hoped to become the fourth country after the United States, Russia and China to land on the moon. The mission, which the agency described as \u201chighly complex,\u201d was aiming to land in the previously unexplored south pole region. The goal was to look for water on the moon and study its topography.\n\nThe success rate of landing on the moon is about 50 percent. Earlier this year, an Israeli spacecraft, Beresheet, attempting to land on the moon crashed in its final moment.\n\nIndia\u2019s homegrown and low-cost space exploration program has notched previous successes. In 2014, it became the first country to reach Mars on its first attempt, making space for itself in the elite global space club. It has announced plans to send its first manned mission to space by 2022.\n\nIndia\u2019s first moon mission, Chandrayaan-1, launched in 2008 and was instrumental in the discovery of water molecules on the lunar surface.\n\nRead more:\n\nIndia\u2019s moon mission signals country\u2019s growing space ambitions\n\nIndia shoots down satellite in test of space defense, Modi announces\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "With Chandrayaan-2, India had hoped to become the fourth country to land on the moon.", "authors": ["Niha Masih", "Foreign Correspondent Covering India", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GGI_X4AWWoC3vlOCGzrJKq1QYw0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GLULAIGSMAI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
