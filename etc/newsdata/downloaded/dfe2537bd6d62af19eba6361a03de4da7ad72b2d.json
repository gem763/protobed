Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAmerica has a present for you: It\u2019s called the Constitution.\n\nIn between jetting off to Denmark for climate change activism and getting haircuts that cost a week\u2019s salary for the very type of downtrodden people you say you represent \u2014 perhaps you could read it.\n\nAnd therein lies the second biggest problem with socialists: their hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cSpending the day in Denmark after C40, enjoying the social democracy that treats healthcare & education as rights, zero-carbon as priority, & infrastructure as a key public good,\u201d she tweeted over the weekend, above a video clip of herself as she moseyed across stones steps in a pool of water, pausing to give a perky shrug the camera lens\u2019 way.\n\nMy, how carefree is the life of a socialist.\n\nThis is the woman who, a little more than a year ago, was the secular world\u2019s prime example of Nobody.\n\nShe was a bartender and waitress.\n\nShe was an underachiever, a reported cum laude graduate of Boston University who had nonetheless put her degree in international relations to work slinging beer and shots for the rowdy party-going types.\n\nThen she ran for the House. Then she defeated Democratic long-timer Joe Crowley \u2014 10-term long-timer \u2014 as well as Republican opponent Anthony Pappas. Then she became a political shining star, carting a Democratic Socialists of America card and a hard-charging \u201clet them eat from the taxpayer dole\u201d devil-may-care \u2018tude toward hard-working Americans\u2019 dollars. After all, taking from the rich and giving to the poor can be such fun \u2014 and oh so lucrative for political careers. Yes?\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s pinned tweet, since July of 2018, has been a series of checkmarks by \u201cMedicare for All; A Living Wage & Labor Rights; K-16 schooling, aka Public Colleges; 100% Renewable Energy; Fixing the pipes in Flint; Not Hurting Immigrants; Holding Wall Street Accountable.\u201d And her rhetoric, post-election, has been nothing shy of demanding more, more, more for those who don\u2019t work for it, haven\u2019t earned it and certainly see no need in trying to work or earn it.\n\nIt\u2019s her contribution to the American Dream.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder of how many \u201crights\u201d she believes people are born with \u2014 and how many tax dollars she needs to pay for these \u201crights.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the matter to mull: Does Ocasio-Cortez truly believe that a country that provides for its citizens all the services that accompany these unicorn wishes could survive economic collapse? After all, when Ocasio-Cortez touts \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d or A Living Wage, or Public Colleges, what she\u2019s really touting is taxpayer-provided health care, taxpayer-funded paychecks and tax-paid college educations.\n\nThat there is any money in America\u2019s coffers at all is due solely to the private sector \u2014 the free market.\n\nTake away the free market, you take away the money that feeds the government. That\u2019s how it works, folks. Government doesn\u2019t generate its own revenue stream, absent taxation.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s failure to recognize that is not just ignorance. It\u2019s hypocrisy.\n\nThe very system that allowed Ocasio-Cortez to rise from humble beginnings, grab the reigns of power and travel to overseas destinations to enjoy the beauty of serenity of select spots in foreign lands, the very system that gives her such freedom and independence and opportunity \u2014 capitalism \u2014 is the very system she condemns. It\u2019s the very system she seeks in America to destroy.\n\nOcasio-Cortez ought to be saying thank you to taxpayers \u2014 to America, land of the free, home of the brave, country of the capitalistic opportunity. Instead, she\u2019s biting the hand that feeds. And smiling and shrugging for selfie shots in the process. Hypocrisy. Hypocrite.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the second-worst thing about socialists. The first?\n\nThe worst thing about socialists is they have no rightful place in America\u2019s government. They don\u2019t belong.\n\nThe fact they serve at all is an affront to the country, the Constitution and the blood, sweat and tears shed by so, so many who formed, fought and continue to fight for our nation of exceptionalism.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
