The rebuff is at least a temporary win for gun-rights advocates hoping the court will use the case to bolster the constitutional right to bear arms.\n\nThe argument will be the court\u2019s first in a decade over the reach of the Second Amendment. The court agreed in January to hear the case.\n\nThree New York City handgun owners and an advocacy group are fighting what they say are the most extreme firearm-transportation restrictions in the country.\n\nUnder the original New York City rules, people with a licensed handgun at home were allowed to take it to one of seven shooting ranges in the city but almost nowhere else. Weapons had to be locked and unloaded during travel, and ammunition had to be put in a separate container.\n\nThe residents who sued said the rules undercut their constitutional right to have a handgun in a house or apartment for self-protection. They said they wanted to be able to take their handguns to more convenient target ranges outside the city and, in the case of a Staten Island man, to his second home.\n\nRevised Regulations\n\nThe city said those things are now permissible after changes to its regulations and a related state law. The city said the revisions left the Supreme Court with nothing left to decide.\n\n\u201cAn intervening change in law entitling plaintiffs to everything they seek is a classic event that renders litigation moot,\u201d the city argued.\n\nThe residents said even the revised regulations are too strict, forbidding a handgun owner from stopping on the way out of town, requiring written permission to take a weapon to a gunsmith, and precluding transport to a summer rental house. They urged the Supreme Court not to reward New York\u2019s \u201cundisguised effort to avoid a precedent-setting loss.\u201d\n\nThe court hasn\u2019t heard a Second Amendment case since it threw out a Chicago handgun ban in 2010. That followed a 2008 decision that for the first time said the Constitution protects individual gun rights.\n\nA federal appeals court in New York upheld the restrictions, saying New Yorkers could go to local shooting ranges, use rented weapons at out-of-town facilities, and acquire additional weapons for second homes.\n\nMichael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, is a donor to groups that support gun control, including Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nThe case is New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. New York, 18-280.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Greg Stohr in Washington at gstohr@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o, Ros Krasny\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court said it will keep a Second Amendment showdown on its argument calendar, even after New York City loosened the gun-transportation restrictions at the center of the fight.The justices rejected the city\u2019s request to dismiss a challenge to the rules as moot, though the", "authors": ["Greg Stohr"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HZzDVhwx9KabI2dQlLPnxQ--~B/aD0zOTY7dz01OTQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/013c4274d8a5deafa8be01f1d04864bd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
