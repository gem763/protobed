Many of us wrote to the actions group to ask that the event be stopped.\n\n\u2018A poll was run with a significant majority voting against it.\n\n\u2018Many of us felt it was wrong to target the Tube and disrupt people using a form of transport that is part of the solution in a zero-carbon world.\n\n\u2018Secondly, many of us felt that targeting stations in poorer parts of London, that are home to people economically on the edge, was deeply problematic.\n\n\u2018It gave strength to the damaging narrative that XR is largely white, privileged and middle class, with little understanding of issues that, at root, are closely related to the immediate issues that we are attempting to meet.\u2019\n\nOther activists said it distracted from other protests outside an arms fair.\n\nXR reportedly carried out an internal poll to question members how they felt about action on the London underground \u2013 which handles around five million journeys per day.\n\nSome 72% were completely opposed while a further 14% did not want it to happen if people might be blocked underground.\n\nAround 7% of those who replied to the poll said they approved of action against the tube network if trains would not get blocked underground.\n\nJust 4% approved of causing chaos on the transport network saying it was \u2018up to the affinity groups to decide how to do it.\u2019\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters glued themselves to trains (Picture: Twitter)\n\nThe activists caused chaos to Londoners trying to use public transport to get to work (Picture: Twitter)\n\nCommuters pleaded to be allowed to get to work, pointing out they had families to feed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXR spokesperson Robin Boardman, 21, said the move was not designed to \u2018inconvenience ordinary people\u2019 but it was the only way to get the government to \u2018take notice\u2019.\n\nHe continued: \u2018That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this in the morning when it will impact business as usual, and not in the evening, when people want to get home to be with their loved ones.\u2019\n\nThe action was intended to only disrupt Tube lines leading into the \u2018richest part of London\u2019, and cause a negative impact on business as a result, a statement from XR said.\n\nAn activist is dragged off the train\n\nThey targeted Stratford, Shadwell and Canning Town station (Picture: Vladimir Morozov/ akxmedia @lepkirk)\n\nThe action is the latest in a series from the anti-climate change group, who have been banned from protesting in London.\n\nAny assembly of more than two people linked to the XR Autumn Uprising action is now illegal in the capital.\n\nSince last week, protesters have targeted London City Airport, shut down areas around Parliament and the Bank of England, and blockaded Google\u2019s HQ, with more than 1,600 people arrested.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion activists have apologised for the disruption caused when a handful of supporters brought parts of the tube network to a standstill.
