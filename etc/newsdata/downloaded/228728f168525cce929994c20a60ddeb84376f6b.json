I don't like the shift to the left.\"\n\nThey'll open the market if Warren wins, it will just be \"a hell of a lot lower,\" Cooperman later said on CNBC. \"It would be a bear market and they go on for a year and go down 25%,\" Cooperman said.\n\nWarren, a Massachusetts senator, has been moving up in the crowded Democratic presidential field, polling only second to former Vice President Joe Biden in a new NBC/WSJ poll. She has been a champion of the left wing for her bank bashing and wealth tax proposals.\n\nWarren has made aggressive economic populism the signature of her White House bid. She has proposed a wealth tax on assets above $50 million and a minimum tax on the profits of the largest corporations, to help finance new government benefits for child care, health care, housing and education.\n\n\"Her policies are counterproductive,\" Cooperman said on CNBC. \"They're negative for capitalism, and capitalism is what brought America into the position we're in today.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNBC in January, Warren said, \"I want these billionaires to stop being freeloaders.\"\n\nCooperman, CEO of Omega Advisors, said the market is still \"in a zone of fair valuation,\" but the policies of the left could be detrimental to the stock market going forward.\n\n\"It looks like she's a credible alternative; I think the stock market will run into some problems,\" Cooperman said. \"Biden's OK; he's a centrist ... but I don't know that he's acceptable to the progressives.\"\n\nWarren's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "Hedge fund titan Leon Cooperman said he's concerned about a shift to the left in the political landscape, which could harm the economy and the stock market.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106138845-1568907930798img_9409.jpg?v=1568908218", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
