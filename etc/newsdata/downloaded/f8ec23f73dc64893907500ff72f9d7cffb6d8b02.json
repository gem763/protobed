Probably not. There's the international break to come and that might be the time to give them 10-14 days extra to get them ready for the Liverpool game.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Solskjaer confirmed that some of those who played in midweek are in line to keep their places for the league clash.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nAlthough goalkeeper David De Gea is almost certain to keep his place in goal, Victor Lindelof looks set to be only survivor from the back four that played against AZ.\n\nHarry Maguire was an unused substitute in that game and is expected to partner the Swede in the heart of defence, while captain Ashley Young is also expected to return after missing the trip altogether.\n\nAxel Tuanzebe, who remained on the bench with Maguire in midweek, is expected to cover for Aaron Wan-Bissaka once again, with question marks still remaining over the full-back's fitness.\n\nDespite recent struggles with a minor groin problem, Marcus Rashford is also in line to return to the starting XI after a cameo appearance in Holland, while Andreas Pereira and Scott McTominay are set for recalls to join Nemanja Matic in midfield after featuring against Arsenal a week ago.\n\nMeanwhile, Solskjaer is set to stick with youngsters Mason Greenwood and Daniel James, with both making impressive starts to their Old Trafford careers.\n\nMan Utd predicted XI: De Gea, Tuanzebe, Maguire, Lindelof, Young, McTominay, Matic, Pereira, James, Rashford, Greenwood", "description": "After their goalless draw with AZ Alkmaar in the Europa, Manchester United return to Premier League action at St James' Park", "authors": ["Hassan Rashed", "Image", "Pa", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20329435.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-AC-Milan-International-Champions-Cup-Principality-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
