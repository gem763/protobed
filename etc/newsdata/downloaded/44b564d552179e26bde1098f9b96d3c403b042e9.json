By mid-2020, Zillow expects to have launched Zillow Offers in 26 cities across the U.S. Right now it\u2019s available in Phoenix, Atlanta and Dallas, among many cities.\n\nPeople who take advantage of this option will have the ability to choose an extended closing time, between seven days and eight months. This feature was designed to make it easier for buyers as they manage overseeing the construction of a new home while still living in their old one.

When Zillow buys a home, the company said it aims \u201cto present an offer that reflects the current market value\u201d of the property. Zillow deducts a service fee and estimated repair and closing costs from the purchase price. (The company said the service fee is comparable to real-estate company fees.)\n\nCustomers who sold their homes to an iBuyer netted 11% less than people who sold their homes on the open market, a MarketWatch analysis found.\n\nA recent MarketWatch investigation also showed that home sellers who go this route are potentially leaving thousands of dollars on the table. On average, customers who sold their homes to an iBuyer netted 11% less than people who sold their homes on the open market, MarketWatch\u2019s analysis found.\n\n\u201cOne of the last things buyers want to deal with when searching for a new home is the stress and hassle that comes along with selling their existing home,\u201d said Zillow brand president Jeremy Wacksman.\n\nBuyers\u2019 need to sell an existing home also poses a risk for home builders. A report from John Burns Real Estate Consulting found that in the last 12 months, publicly-traded builders experienced cancellation rates \u2014 where the buyer pulls out of a deal to buy a newly built home \u2014 of 16% on average. One of the major drivers of cancelled projects was people not being able to sell their existing home in time.\n\nAlso see: Home-builder confidence rises, despite growing concerns about the economy\n\nZillow has partnered with more than 10 home builders across the country, including Brookfield Residential BAM, -0.48%, M/I Homes MHO, -0.84% and PulteGroup PHM, +0.62%.\n\nInstant offer or iBuying programs like Zillow Offers have gained a foothold among people who find the process of selling a home stressful.\n\nShares of Zillow are down nearly 32% over the past three months, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.59% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.49% are up around 1.1% and 1.6% respectively.", "description": "People who buy newly-constructed homes from some builders will be able to sell their current homes to Zillow.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR782_newhom_ZG_20190920143132.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
