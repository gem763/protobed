A devastating drought made Balkisa\u2019s harvests fail, made food prices soar, and then forced her family apart. Her husband migrated in search of work to earn money to provide for his young family, leaving her heavily pregnant and alone. \u201cSometimes if my husband had money he sent it to me so I could eat. Sometimes the money just doesn\u2019t come,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to give birth.\u201d But seven-month-old twins Hassan and Ousseni are lucky, they were born the night after Red Cross support came to Tombokiery village, Niger. The Niger Red Cross provided the family with a small cash grant. \u201cA Niger Red Cross volunteer told me to go first because she saw how exhausted I was. I used the money to buy food, then I went back home to sleep feeling relieved. Before sunrise I had given birth to my twins.\u201d\n\nYuki Sugiura/British Red Cross", "description": "Food photographer Yuk Sugiura\u00a0has spent\u00a0most of her working life capturing the elaborate culinary creations of the world's elite chefs.
