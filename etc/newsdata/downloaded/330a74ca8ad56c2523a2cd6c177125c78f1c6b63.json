And that is just what was happening Friday when a star-studded guest list descended for the nuptials of Bahrain-born fashion designer Misha Nonoo and her American oil-tycoon fianc\u00e9 Michael Hess.\n\nIt is hard to imagine how anything could ruin such a fine event, except maybe an international incident like a potential face-off between Meghan Markle and Ivanka Trump, who have not been in the same room since Ivanka\u2019s dad\u2014aka the president of the United States\u2014called the American royal \u201cnasty\u201d last June.\n\nBoth Americans are expected to be guests of honor at Nonoo\u2019s glitzy wedding alongside the likes of Prince Harry, Jared Kushner, and his brother Joshua\u2014both dear friends of the groom, who attended Harvard with Joshua\u2014and Joshua\u2019s wife, model Karlie Kloss, along with Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and a host of other media darlings.\n\nNonoo is famously credited with playing cupid to Meghan and Harry, and has been a guest at a myriad of recent royal events as well as Meghan\u2019s Manhattan baby shower before Archie was born this year. Meghan and Harry flew by commercial jet to Rome late Thursday, having left Archie at home with the royal babysitters.\n\nThe wedding kicks off with an intimate gala lunch Friday deep inside Rome\u2019s Cinecitta film studios, where much of Federico Fellini\u2019s 1950s film La Dolce Vita was shot. The Daily Beast has learned that guests are, in fact, required to dress in attire from that era all weekend, which could range from cat suits to Anita Ekberg-style gowns made famous when the actress waded into the Rome\u2019s Trevi Fountain in the film. Men will be surely be wearing all manner of slim suits with pencil ties. Expect a few Borsalino hats as well.\n\nIvanka and Jared, who had not yet arrived in Rome by Friday morning, are not expected to attend the Friday lunch, which is said to be meant for Nonoo\u2019s closest pals only. But they are expected to be in attendance at the nuptial ceremony to be held in Rome\u2019s sumptuous 17th-century Villa Aurelia overlooking Rome, which is owned by the prestigious American Academy. A police source confirmed to The Daily Beast that U.S. Secret Service agents have already combed the area in anticipation of the first daughter\u2019s arrival.\n\nThe spacious villa is a mainstay among Roman gliterrati for special events, and Nonoo has timed the ceremony to coincide with sunset so guests can be dazzled by some of the best views of the city from the Janiculum Hill. Guests will reportedly be banned from posting anything on social media from the wedding until official photos have been released.\n\nThe wedding celebration continues Saturday when guests will be treated to bespoke guided tours of Rome before another gala event back at the Cinecitta studios Saturday night to include dancing in the original La Dolce Vita film set.\n\nIt is not known if Ivanka and Jared, or Meghan and Harry, who leave for a royal visit to Africa on Monday, will stay for the Saturday night soiree.", "description": "Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are among those on the star-studded guest list for  fashionista Misha Nonoo\u2019s \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d-themed wedding in Rome on Friday.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568971597/ivankaMeghan_dnxt8q", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
