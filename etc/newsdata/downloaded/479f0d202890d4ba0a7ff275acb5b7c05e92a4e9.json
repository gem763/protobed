It now has 192 members.\n\n\u201cIf the United States leaves, you\u2019ll get those piles, because somehow every country has to figure out how to send mail to the United States\u2026 A major disruption is on the way if we don\u2019t solve the problem today.\u201d\n\nWere the United States to quit the UPU, US stamps would no longer be valid abroad, he said. He said he was \u201cvery optimistic\u201d that a compromise could be reached.\n\nTrump pulls US out of UN postal scheme on China price concerns Read more\n\n\u201cA departure of the United States from the union would mean there is a total disruption of the service to the country,\u201d Hussein said.\n\nThe UPU is one of the oldest international organisations, set up in 1874 to ensure that mail could be delivered anywhere on earth. It establishes a system for calculating the fees, known as \u201cterminal dues\u201d, that countries collect from each other to deliver mail that arrives from abroad.\n\nWashington says the fees are too low, which unfairly benefits exporters from countries such as China, who can send goods ordered online to US customers while the US Postal Service bears part of the cost of delivering them.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who heads the U.S. delegation, called for fixing a system \u201cthat everyone in this room knows is broken\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe mission here today is to retool this system for the brave new world of e-commerce,\u201d he told the three-day talks.\n\nNavarro said the system meant the US Postal Service was effectively spending $300m-$500m to subsidise the cost of delivering imports, including counterfeit goods and drugs mailed to the United States from China.\n\nWarnings have also been sounded about the implications for US military members abroad sending packages home, and for Americans abroad wanting to vote by postal ballots.\n\nHussein said he was \u201cvery optimistic that we are going to find a solution\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have a track record of solving things. We have survived two world wars, and the United Postal Union has always really reinvented itself.\u201d", "description": "Trump says UPU rules unfairly benefit China and wants to charge other countries more than rules permit for deliveries in the US", "authors": ["Staff", "Agencies In Geneva"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa2f392ee33b2f4e2b0d4fa29168258f6c5d231/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=151272356b132421a9f441e31e848533", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
