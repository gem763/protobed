Johnson lost his governing majority Tuesday when one of his party's disgruntled members defected to the opposition party, the Liberal Democrats. A crucial vote Tuesday night meant opposition lawmakers together with a small number of Johnson's fellow Conservatives could introduce a piece of fresh legislation Wednesday afternoon to block the government from pursuing an exit from the European Union without a negotiated withdrawal settlement at the end of October. Johnson has argued that this threat of a \"no-deal Brexit\" is necessary for him to win a compromise in negotiations with the EU, because of the expectation of economic damage that it would inflict on Europe. And he has insisted that if the legislation to block what his opponents call a \"disorderly\" Brexit passes on Wednesday, only an election will help decide, in Johnson's words, \"who goes to Brussels to sort this out,\" at the next summit of European leaders scheduled for mid-October. The order paper for the House of Commons, the lower chamber in the British Parliament, includes a proposal from Johnson that calls for \"early general election.\" That, too, will face a vote on Wednesday evening, but only after that earlier vote on the legislation to block a no deal Brexit.\n\nAnd this sequence of events may reflect a real-world chronology if opposition lawmakers get their way. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Tuesday night that the government will have to wait for the final passage of the legislation introduced on Wednesday before Labour \u2014 as the largest opposition party \u2014 would assent to a fresh election. \"Get the bill through first, in order to take no deal off the table,\" he thundered at a tired-looking Johnson. Under current electoral rules the prime minister cannot trigger an election on his own, since he lacks a parliamentary majority. But that did not stop Johnson from taunting Corbyn over his hesitation to automatically embark on an electoral campaign. \"The leader of the opposition has been begging for an election for years,\" he responded. One way Corbyn hopes to hold on to his party's core voters, who are in favor of continued European Union membership, is to offer the public a second referendum \u2014 an assurance repeated Tuesday night in Parliament. On Wednesday morning, Keir Starmer, Labour's spokesperson on Brexit, said his party would not be \"dancing to Boris Johnson's tune\" when it comes to the timing of a fresh national vote. \"We're going to complete the job in hand, we're going to insure our country against leaving the EU without a deal,\" he told Sky News. \"Then, of course, a general election.\" Analysts say this situation is unprecedented in recent British history. \"This would typically result in an election. But these are not normal times,\" Richard Mylles, a political analyst at Absolute Strategy Research, said in a note to CNBC. He said opposition lawmakers do not trust Johnson and his advisors to set an election date \"in good faith.\" The decision over specific electoral timing would ultimately rest with Downing Street, and critics have expressed concern that a date close to or after Oct. 31 \u2014 the current deadline for Brexit \u2014 could result in an \"accidental\" no-deal scenario. One possible date for a national ballot is Oct. 15, just two days before the start of the Brussels summit, but there is huge uncertainty over what it would bring in Britain's fractious political environment. \"It's very hard to read the political tea leaves,\" Tom Brake, Liberal Democrats' spokesperson on Brexit, acknowledged in an interview with CNBC.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is about to ask Parliament to approve a new general election.", "authors": ["Willem Marx"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105933939-1558902596697gettyimages-1145581438.jpeg?v=1558902662"}
