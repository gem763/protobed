Madam, objectively speaking, we know who and what was done. There is no uncertainty about that. Why your confusion?\u201d Haros asked. \u201cOn that day, 19 Islamic terrorist members of al-Qaeda killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage. Is that clear?\u201d\n\nOmar offered the flippant description of the 9/11 attacks earlier this year during a speech before the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Her speech focused on the federal government\u2019s encroachment on the civil liberties of Muslims in the wake of the attacks, which, she falsely claimed, served as the impetus for CAIR\u2019s founding.\n\n\u201cCAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,\u201d Omar said. CAIR was actually founded in 1994.\n\nHaros concluded his remarks by admonishing Omar \u2014 and the three fellow freshman progressive lawmakers who together refer to themselves as \u201cthe squad\u201d \u2014 not to use the events of September 11th to score cheap political points.\n\n\u201cStop. Stop. Please stop using the bones and ashes of our loved ones as props for your political theater,\u201d Haros said. \u201cTheir lives, sacrifices, and death are worth so much more. Let\u2019s not trivialize them or us. It hurts.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "During a 9/11 memorial service on Tuesday, the son of a woman who died in the World Trade Center castigated Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) for the dismissive way she recently characterized the attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans.Nicholas Haros Jr., wearing a black shirt emblazoned", "authors": ["Jack Crowe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cev1I6xfru1g017wAGf4UA--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/fba4047a63170501417295e3f864994a", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
