As examples, he brought up the basketball league penalizing a manager after comments made in support of protesters in Hong Kong, at which Chinese authorities were offended.\n\n\u201cSome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\u201d Pence said.\n\nIn siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\n\nPence also went after the sportswear company Nike, which famously partnered with social justice activist Colin Kaepernick for a domestic advertising campaign about the importance of values.\n\n\"Nike promotes itself as a so called \u2018social-justice champion,\u2019 but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\" the VP said.\n\nEmbracing censorship \u201cis not just wrong, it\u2019s un-American,\u201d he said. Instead, he argued, US corporations \u201cshould stand up for American values, here at home and around the world.\u201d It is unclear whether the use of \u201cstand up\u201d was deliberate here, given the NBA and Nike\u2019s support for athletes who kneel in protest at the US national anthem.\n\nAlso on rt.com Apple removes app that Hong Kong protesters used to track police movements following vandalism, attacks on officers\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s administration has taken a hard line on China over trade, and Pence explained that they seek a \u201cfundamental restructuring\u201d of Washington\u2019s relationship with Beijing. Using the phrases familiar to Cubans, Iranians, Venezuelans and every other country targeted by the US for regime change, he also said that Washington has no problem with the Chinese people, only their government.\n\nPence also admitted that the US had sought to \u201ctransform\u201d China into a \u201cfree and open society\u201d through trade, but that this approach did not work, and held up democracy as practiced in Taiwan \u2013 an island claimed by China but ruled by the defeated nationalists who escaped the mainland in 1949 \u2013 as a \u201cbetter path for all Chinese people.\u201d\n\nWhile Pence talked about \u201cmutual respect\u201d in US-Chinese relations, he did not explain how US support for separatism in Hong Kong and Taiwan would be respectful to Chinese values \u2013 namely, territorial integrity.\n\nMuch of the destiny of the 21st century will hinge on the US relationship with China.\n\nAfter all that, Pence said that the US wants to continue doing business with China, and relying on Beijing\u2019s cooperation in denuclearizing North Korea and enforcing US sanctions against Iran \u2013 something China has no obligation to do.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
