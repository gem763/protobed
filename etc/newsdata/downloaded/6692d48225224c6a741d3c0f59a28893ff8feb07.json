Add Interest\n\nThe social media giant has \"a responsibility to pull false advertising and ... to intervene when there is advertising that would contribute to voter suppression,\" Butttigieg told reporters after hosting an economic policy event in New Hampshire.\n\nThe mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has come under criticism from 2020 rival Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who charges that Buttigieg is too cozy with Facebook. Buttigieg's aides confirmed this week that his campaign hired two digital analytics staff recommended by Facebook founder and CEO and his wife, Priscilla Chan.\n\nZuckerberg has defended Facebook's refusal to take down content it considers newsworthy \"even if it goes against our standards,\" in an effort to steer clear of criticism that Facebook was infringing on First Amendment rights to free speech. In response to a question last week on fact-checking during his appearance at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg said, \"We think people should be able to see for themselves.\"\n\nWarren also has called for breaking up Zuckerberg's conglomerate, which includes Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nButtigieg, at 37, is the first candidate of the Facebook generation, and was an early adopter of the social media platform. But he said Thursday that federal regulators, with the power to protect consumers and address \"anti-competitive practices,\" should consider remedies that include a breakup.\n\n\"Yes, I believe that breakup of big companies is a remedy that should be on the table,\" he said. \"Now, I don't think that that should be declared in advance by a politician.\"\n\nWarren told reporters in Iowa on Monday that Facebook and its affiliates \"already have way too much influence in Washington.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
