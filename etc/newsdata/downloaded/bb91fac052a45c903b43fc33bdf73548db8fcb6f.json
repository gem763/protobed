Cipollone also accuses House Democrats of violating the due process rights of the president and insists that impeachment is invalid if it isn\u2019t begun by an official resolution. He continues: \u201cYour transparent rush to judgment, lack of democratically accountable authorization, and violation of basic rights in the current proceedings make clear the illegitimate, partisan purpose of this purported \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all a little dramatic. Cipollone goes on:\n\nYour unprecedented action has left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the executive branch and all future occupants of the office of the presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\n\nMost of this is nonsense. The Constitution only specifies the basics of impeachment: The House initiates it and the Senate votes on it. Everything else is left to the respective chambers. No particular process is required. The House is fully empowered to collect evidence, take testimony and subpoena witnesses without passing a resolution to announce it is considering impeachment. The House acts as a kind of grand jury \u2014 where the \u201cArticles of Impeachment\u201d correspond to the counts in an indictment \u2014 with no obligation to take witnesses from the defense. That will come later, if the House impeaches and the Senate holds a trial. In addition to its nakedly partisan claims, the White House is also making its case with constitutional language, but there is no constitutional support for its arguments.\n\nBut we shouldn\u2019t get bogged down in the particulars of the letter or its tenuous relationship to the facts. The problem with the White House response is not that it\u2019s wrong, but that it\u2019s an assertion of unaccountable power. To call impeachment \u201cillegitimate\u201d and reject Congress\u2019s ability to conduct oversight is to put forth a doctrine of presidential infallibility, an extreme form of Richard Nixon\u2019s quip that \u201cwhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d To refuse cooperation and compliance is to challenge the constitutional prerogative of a coequal branch of government.\n\nThe framers understood that re-election wasn\u2019t enough to compel good behavior from the chief executive. As James Madison argued during the constitutional convention of 1787, impeachment exists as a safeguard against the \u201cincapacity, negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate.\u201d But Trump, speaking through Cipollone, rejects this. To this White House, elections are the only acceptable form of accountability. \u201cThe decision as to who will be elected President in 2020 should rest with the people of the United States, exactly where the Constitution places it.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that, according to a longstanding opinion from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, a president cannot be indicted while still in office. If impeachment is illegitimate and Trump intends to defy all congressional subpoenas and investigation, then he\u2019s suddenly untethered the office from the entire constitutional system. He becomes what the framers feared \u2014 an elected king, answerable only to his supporters. (Here it\u2019s worth noting the hypocrisy of relying on the Constitution when it justifies his own power \u2014 Trump is only president because of the Electoral College \u2014 and rejecting it when that power is challenged.)", "description": "His emerging constitutional doctrine leaves no room for the House or the courts.", "authors": ["Jamelle Bouie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/opinion/11bouieWeb/11bouieWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
