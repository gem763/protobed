Andrew Cuomo's executive action to ban sales of most flavored e-cigarettes. This ban would stand for 90 days as a piece of emergency legislation. It would need to be renewed to continue.\n\nThe only two flavors customers will be able to buy are tobacco and menthol. New York state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in the emergency meeting that officials would take a closer look at menthol to decide whether it should be banned as well.\n\nMembers of the Special Codes Committee of the Public Health and Health Planning Council, which is part of the New York State Department of Health, voted to recommend the flavor ban and the full council voted in favor of emergency adoption.\n\nThere needed to be \"urgent action,\" Zucker said. The state could not wait for federal action or the state legislature to come back into session.\n\nThe ban is aimed at cutting the number of children who vape. Zucker presented data to the council that showed New York state high school student use of tobacco products rose 160% from 2014 to 2018. Surveys showed that 40% of 12th-grade students in New York state had used e-cigarettes.", "description": "New York state health officials voted Tuesday to carry out Gov.
