Companies are removed if their float-adjusted market capitalization falls below 0.025% of the overall value of the index.\n\nFirms have to wait a year to get back in and will be admitted only if their value is at least 0.04% of the index. McCrea said that would be equivalent to just under C$1 billion ($754.26 million).\n\n\u201cEnergy companies in Canada have taken quite a bit of a hit lately,\u201d said S&P Global spokesman Ray McConville. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a matter of their stock prices having fallen to the point where their market capitalization is no longer eligible.\u201d\n\nEnergy makes up 17% of the index, down from 25% in 2014. McConville could not say whether so many energy firms had ever been removed in one hit before.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that inclusion or exclusion from the index impacts the ability to raise capital, however, ETF (exchange-traded) funds that tracked the TSX Composite Index will no longer hold these energy names now that they are no longer part of the index,\u201d Kelt Exploration spokeswomen Sara Stark said in an email.\n\nTravis McPherson, vice president of corporate development at NexGen Energy, said being removed from the index did not affect its business at all \u201cother than the unfortunate short-term impact to the share price as a result of short-term investors pre-positioning ahead of any action.\u201d\n\nBirchcliff Energy and NuVista Energy said there would be no impact.\n\nThe other companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "description": "Eight Canadian energy companies were booted out of the S&P/TSX Composite Index on Monday because their market capitalization has dropped below minimum requirements, the latest sign of difficulties facing the country's oil and gas sector.", "authors": ["Nia Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
