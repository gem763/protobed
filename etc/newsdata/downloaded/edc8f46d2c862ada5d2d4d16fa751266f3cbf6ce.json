(Image: Fox Searchlight)\n\nTaika Waititi\u2019s anti-hate satire might feel like it was created as a response to the wave of Trump-era fascism, but Waititi has been trying to make Jojo Rabbit happen for almost a decade.\n\nIn a new interview, Waititi discussed the long road for the film and why, just because it wasn\u2019t created for the here and now, doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s not why it exists.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something where it felt like, \u2018We better make our film now because Nazis are popular again,\u2019\u201d Waititi told the Hollywood Reporter, as part of a long-ranging interview about the movie\u2014about a young member of the Hitler Youth and his imaginary friend, a childlike, idiotic recreation of Adolf Hitler who discovers that his family is secretly safeguarding a young Jewish girl from Nazi persecution.\n\nWaititi shared that he\u2019s been working on Jojo Rabbit since 2011, basing his screenplay on Christine Leunens\u2019 novel Caging Skies\u2014which has a similar narrative, although the idea to have Hitler as the imaginary foil to young Jojo, played by Roman Griffin Davis in the film, was his own.\n\nHe started pitching the project to producers in 2012, but found that, perhaps unsurprisingly, he was having a hard time selling a parody about a young Nazi who\u2019s friends with an imaginary Hitler. It didn\u2019t help that Waititi wanted an A-list actor to play Hitler, as part of a \u201cpackage deal\u201d for potential studios, but couldn\u2019t find anyone willing to take it on, for equally unsurprising reasons according to Waititi:\n\nMost people really loved the script. I think it was a little difficult for people to figure out if it was a good career move, and I can fucking totally understand. Who really wants to see themselves as Adolf Hitler on a poster?\n\nThe film ended up on the Hollywood Black List, and it wasn\u2019t until around 2018 that Fox Searchlight came onboard. According to THR, it was on one condition: They wanted Waititi to play Hitler, as they felt he would \u201cembody the part with the nuances as he\u2019d written them.\u201d\n\nWaititi said he originally wasn\u2019t super comfortable with the idea\u2014in part due to his own heritage of being of Russian-Jewish descent and as Waititi told THR flatly, \u201cI hate Nazis\u201d \u2014 but ultimately agreed.\n\nAnd now, the movie is coming out at a time when it feels more, well, timely than ever\u2014so much so, a Disney executive was reportedly nervous about releasing it, so as not to hurt the brand\u2019s image. Waititi said the creation and release of Jojo Rabbit wasn\u2019t an intentional commentary on where things are in 2019, as the movie\u2019s been in the works for a long time. But he does recognise that it may not entirely be a coincidence that the movie is coming out now.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t something where it felt like, \u201cWe better make our film now because Nazis are popular again. Yay!\u201d I\u2019m not one of these people who\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you know that Mercury is in retrograde, so that\u2019s why this happened today.\u201d I do believe that things happen when they need to happen, and you can\u2019t force it\u2014or maybe it\u2019s just that things happen when you notice them.\n\nJojo Rabbit comes out on Boxing Day in Australia.", "description": "Taika Waititi\u2019s anti-hate satire might feel like it was created as a response to the wave of Trump-era fascism, but Waititi has been trying to make Jojo Rabbit happen for almost a decade.
