There are not many people who do anything for you these days.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"He understands the difficulty that I can't stop and he's never moaned about it - he just does it for me.\n\n\"He's a great guy, a top guy. I laugh because he runs out in his sandals.\n\n\"I had a time when my daughter Emily Grace [six] wasn't too good.\n\n\"I had to take a lot of time off work and it's a lot of financial strain to keep a house going.\n\n\"Arslan would just say 'leave it, I don't want it' [when I went to pay] and I just grew a friendship with him.\n\n\"He's a great person. He has children of his own and when I was in hospital with my daughter he came up and greeted us.\n\n\"I've never seen him as the takeaway guy, he's always been a friend - always nice, polite and helpful whenever I've needed him.\n\n\"I just wasn't expecting [the reaction to my Facebook post]. I just put it up for a bit of a laugh - I didn't expect 17,000 people to find it funny.\n\n\"I've had loads of people messaging me saying 'that's the funniest video I've ever seen'.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"There are people I don't even know messaging me about Arslan and stuff he's done for them and saying 'he's a great guy'.\"\n\nAbout once a week, David drives past the shop in his truck and rings up Arslan to asks if he can deliver his order through the window.\n\nDavid drives up slowly to the traffic lights outside the shop. As the lights go amber, he gives a toot of his horn and Arslan runs out.\n\nDavid said: \"There's nowhere to stop in a truck [around there] so I can't pull up just to go in and get some tea.\n\n\"And there's no time to stop these days in transport - you've gotta just keep going.\n\n\"So it's just practical that as I drive past he throws it in the window.\n\n\"It all started when I had a passenger with me and there was a massive traffic jam around there.\n\n\"The passenger who was with me at the time just leaned out the window and grabbed it. But when I don't have a passenger, how is [Arslan] going to do it?\n\n\"So once I just rang him up and said 'I'm in the truck - is there any chance you can run outside and pass it up to me and I'll pay you next time?'\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nArslan said: \"I was chuffed with the video. A lot of my friends and customers on Facebook are sharing it.\n\n\"I didn't know he was making the video so my reaction was natural. If I knew what he was doing my reaction probably would have been different.\n\n\"[I do this for David because] he's a nice lad, he's had a few hard times.\n\n\"It's just the way he's been from day one - the way he approaches you and calls you 'brother' - it just gives you a different kind of feeling.\"\n\nDavid posted the video on Facebook straight after he filmed it with the comment 'No place to stop in the truck? No problems - flying doner wraps available'.\n\nHis post has racked up more than 28,500 views, 70 comments and 460 shares with people commenting about Arslan's dedication to getting David his doner wrap.\n\nTom Taylor said: \"Dedication that.\"\n\nSarah G New said: \"When the takeaway guy has your back.\"\n\nDavid replied: \"He's my hero.\"", "description": "David Crossley, 25, was driving past Sizzlers Shaw in, Oldham, Greater Manchester, when owner Arslan Anwar Saifi bolted from the shop to hand deliver a doner wrap", "authors": ["Jonny Wilkinson", "Todd Fitzgerald", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540146.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-KNM_FLYING_DONER_THROUGH_WINDOW_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
