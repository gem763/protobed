Let\u2019s explore the issue with the help of a chart.\n\nPlease click here for an annotated chart of S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.86%.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 The chart shows initial positive reaction in the stock market to the jobs report.\n\n\u2022 The jobs report has a strong headline: The unemployment rate fell to 3.5% vs. 3.7% consensus.\n\n\u2022 Digging beneath the surface, there is significant weakness.\n\n\u2022 Non-farm private payrolls came in at 114,000 vs. 120,000 consensus.\n\n\u2022 Non-farm payrolls came in at 136,000 vs. 145,000 consensus.\n\n\u2022 Most importantly, average hourly earnings were flat vs. 0.3% consensus.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that long-term Arora portfolios are up to 62% protected at this time. The protection is reviewed daily.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows the Arora signal to start a short-term trade by short-selling Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +1.13%. For those who could not short but are aggressive, a signal was given to buy leveraged inverse ETF SQQQ, -3.19% for a short-term trade. This inverse ETF rises when the stock market falls.\n\n\u2022 Both short-term trades are profitable as of this writing. Partial profits have been taken on them.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that, when weaker-than-expected ISM manufacturing data was released, the stock market fell.\n\n\u2022 Manufacturing is only a small part of the U.S. economy.\n\n\u2022 More important is ISM non-manufacturing data.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that near the lows, President Trump made positive comments about a trade deal with China and invited China to investigate Joe Biden, his Democratic rival.\n\n\u2022 The chart shows that the market reversed and ended the day higher on Trump\u2019s comments.\n\n\u2022 Trump has consistently shown impeccable timing to stop the market decline and reverse it. Please see \u201cTrump talks up the stock market, but this chart tells the real story\u201d and \u201cTrump claims the stock market would be higher if he hadn\u2019t confronted China \u2014 is he right?\u201d\n\n\u2022 The Arora Report recently wrote before the market reversal to the upside at a time when the market was falling: \u201cThe chart shows that RSI [relative strength index] is oversold. In plain English, this means that the stock market can easily stage a big jump up on the slightest bit of good news.\u201d\n\n\u2022 As shown on the chart, RSI was very oversold when Trump made his comment, and that is the main reason that the market started rising. Once the market started rising, a short-squeeze took place, moving the market higher.\n\n\u2022 According to algorithms at The Arora Report, about one-third of the up move on Trump\u2019s comment was attributable to short-covering.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.
