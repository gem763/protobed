Nadiya is a fantastic teacher, I want to be a fantastic student, but we\u2019re on Strictly Come Dancing, not Love Island or some other show where people get themselves together.\u2019\n\nHe said he\u2019s on Strictly not Love Island (Picture: PA)\n\nHe added: \u2018As I said, I think the chemistry between the two of us is perfect because we know what we\u2019re here for and we\u2019re enjoying the process, even though being in the dance-off isn\u2019t fun.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple will be heading into the third live show with a quickstep to The Greatest Showman\u2019s From Now On.\n\nAnd if it appears they have sexual chemistry, the former goalkeeper is more than okay with that.\n\nHe stated: \u2018If that\u2019s what it looks like then we\u2019re happy.\u2019\n\nThe pair will be quickstepping their way into the third week (Picture: PA)\n\nThey\u2019re not the first partnership to have fallen under scrutiny this year, as AJ Pritchard and his celeb dancing buddy Saffron Barker have had to defend themselves over speculation.\n\nAfter pictures emerged of them looking cosy together, the blogger\u2019s reps told Metro.co.uk: \u2018AJ and Saffron are great friends and have been training really hard for their performance on Saturday evening \u2013 this is clearly only what these pictures show.\n\n\u2018They are loving the competition and cannot wait to perform their Cha-Cha to the Nation.\u2019\n\nAJ is, of course, dating dancer Abbie Quinnen, while Saffron is currently single.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing continues Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
