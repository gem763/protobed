When you drive in it looks like a normal service area, like any other motorway services. There's the Esso garage, Starbucks and McDonalds,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Essex live WS)\n\n\"It was at the end of a shift, I finished at lunchtime and had to go visit a friend so thought I'll get something to eat, so I went to McDonald\u2019s.\n\n\"I had parked there previously and all of a sudden this fine comes out of the blue.\n\n\"You walk in and they just watch you. There's CCTV everywhere. It was like they were watching me leave.\"\n\nMr Duncan has since been back to the car park, curious to find out how many people get caught out.\n\nIn just thirty minutes, he claims he saw 10 cars park in Starbucks but walk over to McDonalds.\n\n\"I sat by the window watching,\" he said.\n\n\"This family bounced across to McDonalds with their kids, seemingly unaware. It's a nice treat for the kids that\u2019s going to cost them \u00a3100.\"\n\nHe told the families that they may have been fined and warned them to park elsewhere next time.\n\nHe said: \"It's beyond a joke.\n\n(Image: Essex live WS)\n\n\"Something has got to be done about it, it\u2019s not clearly signed.\"\n\nAfter his first appeal, the letter from Met Parking Services said: \u201cThe car park you parked in is not McDonald\u2019s car park, their car park is adjacent to their restaurant.\n\n\"The terms and conditions of use of the car park are clearly stated on signs prominently displayed in this area. These include that the car park is for the use of Southgate Park customers while they are on the premises only, that McDonald's is NOT on Southgate Park and that there is no free parking for McDonald's.\n\n\"You have acknowledged that you left your vehicle in this car park while you went to McDonald's therefore we believe the charge notice was issued correctly and we are upholding it.\"\n\nMet Parking Services has been approached for comment.", "description": "The Starbucks car park near Stansted Airport has become notorious for people landing parking tickets, after they wrongly assume they can also go into McDonald's, just four metres away, next door", "authors": ["Louise Lazell", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Essex Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20642069.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Dad-fights-against-parking-ticket-in-most-ridiculous-car-park.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
