It will also allow Global Strike to practice how it conducts bomber operations from a forward operating location, the release said.\n\nBy training with their counterparts in allied or partner militaries, the airmen in the task force become familiar with how operations are carried out in different parts of the world, the release said.\n\nGlobal Strike Command said it would not discuss details of future operations for security reasons. In an email, US Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa said that the bombers will be deployed until their missions conclude but did not say how long that might be.\n\nB-52s were last at Fairford in April, when a task force of six Stratofortresses from Barksdale's 2nd BW concluded a months-long deployment. It was the largest deployment of a single bomber platform since the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nB-52s from Barksdale also deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in May to fly deterrence missions against Iran.", "description": "US Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa said that the bombers will be deployed until their missions conclude but did not say how long that might be.", "authors": ["Stephen Losey", "Air Force Times"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5936cda9b74af446008b6b08?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
