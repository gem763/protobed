I am absolutely disgusted.\n\n\u2018If it had been a man who had attacked me I\u2019m sure the consequences would have been completely different.\n\n\u2018I am in despair as to how this whole case has been handled and I feel I have received no justice. The whole thing is diabolical\u2019.\n\nGabriella M'rabet, 25, (left on the day of the attack) says Eliza Peereboom, 23, (right outside court) has been let off 'scot-free' despite being convicted of ABH and assault after attacks on three women on a train as it pulled into Reading station last summer\n\nPeereboom clamped down on Miss M'rabet's knee for up to 15 seconds, leaving her with this wound and severe bruising\n\nMs M'rabat had been at Newbury racecourse with her father and brother on August 20 last year.\n\nShe tried to leave the train passing Peereboom, who was already rowing with two other women and then pulled her hair.\n\nMs M'rabet, 25, has told MailOnline that she and Peereboom's two other victims, Ciara Jones and her friend Nicole Deadfield, have been 'denied justice'\n\nDaniella kicked her attacker who then sank her teeth into her leg just above the knee and didn't let go for up to 15 seconds, taking out a lump of flesh.\n\nDescribing her ordeal she said: \u2018I woken by my father to get off for our connecting train as I walked towards the back of the carriage to exit off the train, I realised there was some sort of commotion going on between other females.\n\n'Suddenly my hair was violently pulled. I kicked out to get her off me and she bit me on the leg. I screamed and jumped and was helped by my family and friends off the train.\n\n\u2018The police turned up and acted as if I was the criminal. I was given no medical treatment despite me repeatedly telling them I had been bitten and they put me in handcuffs. Meanwhile my attacker wasn\u2019t [cuffed] and the officers spent their time checking she was ok. The only reason the case went to trail is due to chasing the police to take a statement following the incident'.\n\nDuring the fight Peereboom also pulled the hair of Ciara Jones and her friend Nicole Deadfield before she bit the leg of Gabriella M'rabet.\n\nMailOnline has asked British Transport Police and the Courts and Tribunals Service for comment.\n\nWhen she appeared at Reading Crown Court yesterday, Peereboom also dramatically sacked her barrister Thomas Quinton after she took exception to how he referred to her in court.\n\nPeereboom had arrived at the dock looking like 'a million dollars' according to Mr Quinton, who attempted to paint a picture of the defendant as buying her clothes from Primark and 'wearing \u00a32 sunglasses.'\n\nEliza Peereboom (pictured) had been travelling home from celebrating at Newbury racecourse when she bit the leg of another passenger - causing a permanent scar and leaving her needing tetanus jabs\n\nGabriella M'rabet, was travelling back to Oxford from Newbury racecourse (pictured second left with her father and brother and friends) but was bitten as she tried to change at Reading\n\nHe told Judge Sarah Campbell: 'She is doing the best she can to feel some value, that has been her focus.'\n\nBut after a pause in proceedings to allow Mr Quinton to take instructions from Peereboom, he re-entered announcing to the court that Peereboom was not speaking to him.\n\n'The defendant is very unhappy with what I have said in court so Miss Kate Parker will be defending her from now on. The defendant is not talking to me, she is talking directly to the Probation service,' he added.\n\nAt an earlier hearing, the court had heard details of the leg biting incident - which occurred as the train pulled into Reading train station and a row began between Peereboom, Miss Jones and Miss Deadfield.\n\nThe jury at Reading Crown court were shown 23 minutes of CCTV footage which caught the fracas.\n\nIt was also shown pictures taken by Ms Marabet of her bite injury the day after the incident.\n\nShe said: 'I had a bite mark and a sore head from where my hair was pulled. I went to the doctors and I had to receive a Tetanus jab once a month for three months and a course of antibiotics. I have a scar now.'\n\nPeereboom currently resides with family friends in Amsterdam, and questions were raised in court today over how she might come back to carry out unpaid work as part of her sentence\n\nA judge at Reading Crown Court said she was going to defer sentencing for two months while Peereboom could either find a place to live in the UK to undertake her unpaid work or get herself a job to pay compensation\n\nThe court also heard- when Mr Quinton was still representing Peereboom - that the Dutch-born model and actress currently resides with family friends in Amsterdam.\n\nThis caused difficulties for the Probation Service as she would be required to undertake seven hours of unpaid work a week, meaning Peereboom would have to return to the UK every weekend.\n\nMr Quinton said: 'The defendant's understanding of an overnight coach to the UK every weekend to do the hours was that she does not need to spend any money other than the \u00a38 coach fare - there seems to be a lack of understanding of the practicalities.'\n\nAfter the change of barristers, Judge Campbell said: 'I feel I am left with not many options. You are 23 years of age and you were found guilty of assault by beating and causing actual bodily harm while on a busy train, which in my view, was deeply unpleasant and animalistic.\n\n'Your sarcastic demeanour could be seen on the CCTV footage as you pulled a victim's hair hard and removed it from her head in clumps.\n\n'What ensued can only be described as a scrum and you lost control of yourself. Miss Marabet was trying to get past you when her leg was bitten causing a permanent scar and needing tetanus jabs.'\n\nThe judge added that Peereboom's previous warning in 2011 for biting a police officer when she was 15 years old and her difficult upbringing, having been put in care at the age of 14, had to be taken into consideration.\n\nShe suggested that under the exceptional circumstances, she was going to defer sentencing for two months while Peereboom could either find a place to live in the UK to undertake her unpaid work or get herself a job to pay compensation.\n\nThe sentencing will take place in December.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Gabriella M'rabet, 25, says\u00a0Eliza Peereboom, 23, has been let off 'scot-free' despite being convicted of ABH after attacks on three women at Reading station last summer.", "authors": ["Martin Robinson", "Chief Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/17/19599488-0-image-a-81_1570812395815.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
