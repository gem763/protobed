We got a huge backlash, and I wanted to make clear that [the organization] has no [political] position. We're here to play basketball and not to offend anybody.\"\n\nCNN gave an overview of the Hong Kong protests:\n\n\"It all started in June when millions came out to oppose a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to China. Carrie Lam, the city's leader, has shelved the bill, but the protests have morphed into something bigger. Some are now calling for Lam to step down, greater democracy and an inquiry into alleged policy brutality.\n\n\"As the demonstrations have dragged on, protesters have embraced more extreme, sometimes violent, tactics. And police have done the same.\"\n\nThe Rockets have traveled to Asia for a pair of preseason games against the Toronto Raptors at Saitama Super Arena in Japan on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nFertitta, whom Forbes estimates has a net worth of $4.8 billion, purchased the team in October 2017.", "description": "Houston Rockets  owner Tilman Fertitta said the  NBA  organization doesn't hold political views after general manager  Daryl Morey  posted an image of support for protesters in Hong Kong...", "authors": ["Tim Daniels"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/831/555/hi-res-21556e48408e835992bef45bf0b97863_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
