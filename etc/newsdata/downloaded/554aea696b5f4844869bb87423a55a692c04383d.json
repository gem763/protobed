I thought England were outstanding last night but they have a very good chance. They might have to be a bit more expansive the way they want to play. They had a pretty simple game plan tonight in terms of the scrums and box kicking from De Klerk and Pollard.\n\n\u201cIt was very effective and for them it was about making the final and doing whatever it took to do that.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They were strong and physical at the scrum and drove pretty well and their collision stuff was good. They were willing to take us on up front. There was not a lot of flowing rugby played, we tried to move the ball a little bit in the first-half and we went through the arm wrestle and there was a lot of attrition. But I am very proud of the boys in never giving up. With a little bit of luck and a bounce of the ball it might have been different.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s progression to the final continues their remarkable turnaround under head coach Rassie Erasmus, who took charge of a Springboks side in disarray two years ago and could potentially transform them into World Cup winners in the short time he\u2019s been in the job.\n\nWhen told of Gatland\u2019s belief that they can successfully challenge England, Erasmus said: \u201cIt\u2019s good we can go all the way, that\u2019s great!\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re a team that\u2019s been together for 25 test matches, we\u2019ve had personnel changes coming in and we\u2019ve played teams with different styles. We\u2019re still in a place where we suddenly have to adapt to play teams, like New Zealand with a fast running game, we\u2019re used to that, but a team like Wales with a long kicking game is different for us to try and play from our own 22 and so on.\n\n\u201cI think [Gatland\u2019s] right, there are definitely some areas of our game that we need to improve. But we\u2019ve given ourselves a chance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played four games with England in the last 18 months and it\u2019s 2-2. The three test matches in SA and then the last one in Twickenham, so we adapt to the way they play but they\u2019re obviously a lot better than when we last played them and we saw last night in the way that they dismantled New Zealand. But we give ourselves a chance with a six-day turnaround. I\u2019m not 100 per cent sure that the World Cup final will be won by a very expansive style and wonderful tries \u2013 it might be, I might be wrong \u2013 but I think we\u2019ll go and try and grind it out.\u201d\n\nThe defeat does not end Wales\u2019s campaign, with Gatland set to lead his side for the final time in the third-place play-off that will hand him one last attempt to beat the All Blacks for the first time before heading back to his homeland to coach the Chiefs and start his preparations for his third consecutive Lions tour as head coach where he will come up once again against Erasmus\u2019s South Africa side.\n\n\u201cFor me, my last game in charge against the All Blacks will be hugely monumental,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cAs a coach, apart from being with the Lions, it\u2019s the team I haven\u2019t beat with Wales.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to be able to achieve that and then I\u2019ve got some excitement ahead about the challenges going back to New Zealand with the Chiefs and then back to the Lions in 12 months or so and then try to have some revenge on tonight\u2019s game against South Africa. Maybe in a couple of years against the Lions we\u2019ll be able to do that.\u201d", "description": "Warren Gatland believes South Africa\u00a0can beat England\u00a0in the Rugby World Cup\u00a0final after his Wales\u00a0side came up agonisingly short in a 19-16 semi-final defeat.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/13/Warren-Gatland-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
