They\u2019re part of the game.\u201d\n\nFederer looked razor sharp to start the match but was not able to maintain his usual high level against the gritty Bulgarian.\n\nThe turning point came in the fourth set, Dimitrov fighting off five break points to win the set and level match at 2-2.\n\n\u201cI was trying to stay in that game and make him stay on the court as much as possible,\u201d said Dimitrov. \u201cAfter that he started slowing down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a best of five sets. Anything can happen.\u201d\n\nAnd something unexpected did.\n\nBefore the start of the fifth set Federer called for the trainer, who, after a brief conversation with the 38-year-old, escorted him off the court for a medical time out to deal with a back problem.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nWhen play resumed Dimitrov seized his chance, breaking Federer to open the fifth and then a second time with the Swiss unable to mount any defence as the Bulgarian went on to claim the biggest win of his career.\n\n\u201cI just needed some treatment on my upper - what is it - back, neck,\u201d said Federer. \u201cJust needed to try to loosen it up, crack it and see if it was going to be better.\u201d", "description": "Grigor Dimitrov stepped out of Roger Federer's shadow on Tuesday to claim a spot in the U.S. Open semi-finals with a shock 3-6 6-4 3-6 6-4 6-2 win over the wounded Swiss.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426005561&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830C2"}
