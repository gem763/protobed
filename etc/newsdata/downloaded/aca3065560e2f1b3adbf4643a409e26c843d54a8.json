Oil prices dip on weak demand outlook, supply concerns\n\nBy Roslan Khasawneh\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Monday\n\namid persistent concerns about the global economic outlook and\n\nthe impact on oil demand, while Russia again missed its target\n\nto cut oil output last month.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude oil futures fell by 10\n\ncents, or 0.2%, to $59.32 a barrel by 0108 GMT.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures were down by 9 cents, or 0.2%,\n\nto $53.69.\n\n\"Commodity markets continue to struggle amid weak economic\n\ndata,\" said ANX Bank in a note.\n\nChina's economic growth slowed to 6% year-on-year in the\n\nthird quarter, its weakest in 27-1/2 years and short of\n\nexpectations due to soft factory production and continuing trade\n\ntensions. Still, a 9.4% year on year increase in China's refinery\n\nthroughput for September signalled that petroleum demand from\n\nthe world's biggest oil importer remained robust. On the supply side, Russia said on Sunday it produced more\n\noil in September than envisaged by a global deal due to an\n\nincrease in gas condensate output as the country prepared for\n\nwinter. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\n\n(OPEC), Russia and other oil producers, an alliance known as\n\nOPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million\n\nbarrels per day (bpd) from the start of this year.\n\nBut several countries, including OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia,\n\nhave complained about Russia's failure to comply with the deal\n\nin full.\n\nTalks between OPEC members Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to\n\nrestart oil production from jointly-operated fields in the\n\n500,000 bpd Neutral Zone added to concerns of rising supplies.\n\nKuwait's deputy foreign minister on Saturday said\n\nnegotiations were \"very positive\" after Kuwaiti media, citing\n\nunidentified sources, said the two Gulf oil producers had agreed\n\nto resume crude output from oilfields in the Saudi\u2013Kuwaiti\n\ndivided zone. \"Those extra barrels will come to market at a most unwelcome\n\ntime,\" said Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader\n\nreferring to crude oil production from the Neutral Zone.", "description": "Oil prices dip on weak demand outlook, supply concerns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0Q0D0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
