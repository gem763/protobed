The consensus around Rihanna\u2019s entry into the lingerie space is that today's biggest name in intimates apparel could never. L Brands had an opportunity to prove otherwise.\n\nAccording to Fortune, at Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Victoria\u2019s Secret chief executive officer John Mehas, who joined the company from Tory Burch last year, expressed confidence that the path to success was evolution and putting women at the center of the brand. \u201cWe need to be led by her, for her,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Mehas, the future of Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2014a brand that hasn\u2019t cast size-inclusive models and whose parent company\u2019s stock has fallen 28 percent since the beginning of the year\u2014will look different by way of more wireless bras, a push toward matching bra and underwear sets, and a new approach to sales-associate training, CNBC reports. \u201c[Customers have] been very vocal about what [they\u2019d] like to see from us in terms of inclusivity, #MeToo, rethinking the fashion show,\u201d Mehas said. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially in agreement at this.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting, sister brand VS Pink revealed images of its new direction as well\u2014one aimed to win back its Gen Z market. As Wall Street Journal reporter Khadeeja Safdar shared on Twitter, its creative team teased an upcoming campaign that featured a group of models of different sizes wearing brightly colored clothing. The image suggested a more body-positive approach to product and advertising, but any information about potential size expansion has yet to be confirmed.\n\nPink\u2019s CEO Amy Hauk (who, like Mehas, assumed the position last year) promised at the meeting that the brand is \u201ccommitted to learning\u201d and shifting its focus to the \u201cpower of femininity,\u201d according to Fortune. But at the main Victoria\u2019s Secret line, a clear vision has not yet been shared. \u201cAmy and the team are a little further ahead than we are,\u201d Mehas said. Hauk was also the only female executive to present on stage at the investor meeting.\n\nThese investor meetings come a little over a month since L Brand\u2019s former chief marketing officer Ed Razek left his post. A 36-year Victoria\u2019s Secret vet, he was at the helm throughout the time when the brand\u2019s identity was made iconic, i.e., the era of the VS Angel. Thin cis-gender models, in heavily padded bras, oozed sex appeal that felt intended for the male gaze. A \u201cfantasy,\u201d as Razek would call it, but one that excluded anyone who didn\u2019t fit those parameters\u2014something the former executive confirmed in an interview with Vogue last year.\n\nIt\u2019s either perfect or unfortunate timing that the investor meeting was shortly followed by the Savage x Fenty show. Rihanna\u2019s lingerie brand is led by and speaks directly to women, and has embraced all intersections of female identity across body types, sizes, races, sexualities, and abilities.\n\nCEO Les Wexner would later close the day\u2019s session by commenting that leadership at L Brands is \u201cbetter than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d Even if that\u2019s the case, Rihanna was mere hours away from suggesting that \u201cbetter than ever\u201d is perhaps still not enough.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Glamour\n\n", "description": "At L Brands investor meetings in Ohio, executives announced a new direction and look for Victoria's Secret.
