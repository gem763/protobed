This is something that we\u2019re able to do through the Commerce Clause and this is something that is not prevented from, wouldn\u2019t prevent the United States from doing by the Second Amendment. So this is constitutionally sound,\" O'Rourke explained.\"This is absolutely necessary if we care about the lives of our fellow Americans.\"\n\nOnce again, he referenced a conversation with gun owners that took place at an Arkansas gun show, as a reason that his proposal is \"constitutionally sound.\"\n\nHe claimed those who own AR-15s approached him and said, \"'I own one of these guns, don\u2019t need it to hunt, don\u2019t need it for self-defense. This is the right thing to do, I would gladly give it up because I also have kids who are in school and I fear for their safety or I have grandkids and want to make sure that this country is safe for them.'\"\n\n\"So not only is this constitutionally sound, I think there\u2019s support beyond the Democratic Party to include Republicans, independents, gun owners, and non-gun owners alike to do the right thing,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nBeto needs a reality check. He doesn't seem to understand the difference between wanting something and actually having it. He can want a mandatory confiscation of AR-15s because \"it's the right thing to do\" but that doesn't mean that it's constitutionally sound. Just because he believes this policy proposal should become a reality doesn't mean what he's saying is legal.\n\nHe's naive if he thinks every single person is going to willingly turn in their guns. The Founding Fathers protected the right to keep and bear arms because they knew an armed society was a controlled society. They wanted to protect the people and keep the government from becoming tyrannical. Beto's plan is a step in the direction we were warned about.", "description": "Facepalm..09/15/2019 19:07:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/baacaca6-4152-48bb-81e1-75c7736d8b69.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
