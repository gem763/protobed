Don\u2019t sign a contract. Why would give as much of two years of your life to a provider? Their service could get worse. You could find a better offer. Hell, in that time, 5G could become a viable NBN alternative.\n\nThankfully, shackling yourself to a telco isn\u2019t your only choice, with many providers offering contract-free plans now. If signing a long-term contract fills you with dread, you can always opt for a more flexible option where you can leave whenever you want, for whatever reason.\n\nYou could be moving overseas, unhappy with your service, or sick of it all and abandoning modern society to live out the rest of your days as a forest witch. Most NBN providers have an optional modem you can buy, but some force you to buy a model they range. To make it a bit easier, we\u2019re only looking at plans where a modem purchase is optional, and where you won't get hit with any upfront setup fees. Here are some of our favourite no-contract NBN plans with no setup fees:\n\nNBN 50 plans with no-contract and at least 500GB\n\nIn most cases, you can nab yourself a contract-free NBN 50 plan for less than $70 per month. \"Premium\" providers can and will charge a little extra, but there are plenty of options priced between $60 and $70.\n\nSome of this is thanks to promotional pricing. For example, Tangerine will give you your first six months at a discounted rate. You\u2019ll pay $59.90 per month for your first half-a-year, and $69.90 thereafter. It\u2019s worth remembering this plan is contract-free, so you always have the option of leaving after your discount runs out.\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer a plan free from timed promotional pricing, you could consider SpinTel. $64.95 per month will get you an unlimited data NBN 50.\n\nNew provider on the block Superloop is also running a promotional discount, but for the life of your plan. If you sign up before January 31 next year, you\u2019ll get $5 off your monthly plan fee on NBN 50 plans. That means you can get a 500GB plan for $69.95 per month. Considering the telco\u2019s high reported evening speeds, it could be worth considering.\n\nNBN 100 plans with no-contract and at least 500GB\n\nNBN 100 plans have gotten a bit more expensive in recent months, but there are still cheaper options around. Thanks to a promo, you can pay as little as $79.90 per month for an NBN 100 plan with Tangerine. This discount will apply for your first six months; you\u2019ll pay $89.90 thereafter.\n\nIf you don\u2019t need unlimited data, Superloop has an NBN 100 plan with 500GB for $79.95 per month. Superloop reports typical evening speeds of 90Mbps on its NBN 100 plans, besting the likes of Aussie Broadband, TPG, iiNet, and more.\n\nAt the higher end of the pricing spectrum, you've got unlimited NBN 100 plans from the likes of Aussie Broadband at $99 per month. Aussie Broadband is one of the only ISPs that provides data about how much NBN capacity it buys, which can help provide a much better idea of the actual speeds you can expect.\n\nAlex Choros is Managing Editor at WhistleOut, Australia's phone and internet comparison website.", "description": "Looking for a new NBN plan?
