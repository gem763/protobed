If they miss impeachment proceedings it won\u2019t look good,\u201d the strategist said.\n\nBasil Smikle, the former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party, said talking about impeachment and not health care and other policies could cost candidates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a concern that the more candidates spend time talking about impeachment, the less they can talk policy, which helped Democrats retake the House in 2018,\u201d Smikle said.\n\nPolls show growing support for an impeachment inquiry, but they also show a majority of voters want Trump\u2019s fate to be decided in next year\u2019s election.\n\nFifty-two percent of respondents to an NPR-PBS Newshour and Marist poll last week said they backed an impeachment inquiry, but 58 percent said Trump\u2019s future should be decided by voters next year.\n\nThe candidates have been taking a wait-and-see approach to the inquiry.\n\nAsked if there is concern about impeachment taking Sanders off the trail, his campaign manager Faiz Shakir told The Hill in an email, \u201cNot at the moment. The House has a lot of work still to do before we get to that stage.\u201d\n\nA Democratic aide close to the Warren campaign said \u201cthe action is happening in the early states now.\u201d Another ally said she\u2019s \u201ca senator first. Candidate second.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with NPR this week, Sen.

That\u2019s going to be a real moment for her,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis would be an opportunity to break through. Politically there\u2019s no downside.\u201d\n\nDemocratic strategist Karen Finney said the candidates also \u201chave an opportunity to draw a stark contrast between the way they would lead and deal with corruption and any appearance of it with the drama and corruption of the Trump White House and the chaos of the GOP.\u201d\n\nJulian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University said the inquiry would not be \u201cnecessarily problematic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will take them off the road, but it will also allow the legislators to participate in a potentially damaging debate for Republicans about the corruption of the president and the complicity of the GOP,\u201d Zelizer said.\n\nThe candidates who should be concerned are the ones who don\u2019t serve in the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou want to be at the center of the conversation rather than trying to light your hair on fire,\u201d Petkanas said.", "description": "Democrats are concerned the House impeachment inquiry could bleed into the primary season and take presidential candidates such as Sens.
