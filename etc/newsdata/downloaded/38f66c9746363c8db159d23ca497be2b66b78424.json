The defense surrendered 380 yards passing and three TDs to Case Keenum, didn\u2019t get much pressure up front and looked suspect in the secondary before stepping up in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt was the difference between the two halves,\u201d coach Doug Pederson said Monday. \u201cYou think about defensively we couldn\u2019t get off the field on third down in the first half, but yet we did in the second half, and offensively we couldn\u2019t convert a third down, and in the second half we did. It\u2019s just a credit to the guys making subtle adjustments at halftime, but it just boiled down to execution, and the only way we were going to get back in the game was to convert those, honestly, and they did a nice job doing that.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nJackson\u2019s ability to stretch the field was quite evident on the two deep balls, and his presence makes a talented offense even more dangerous because it opens up things for other receivers. Alshon Jeffery had five catches for 49 yards and one TD, plus he turned a backward pass into a 2-yard TD run. Zach Ertz had five catches for 54 yards. Nelson Agholor and Dallas Goedert weren\u2019t big factors only because there\u2019s one ball. The offense didn\u2019t just rely on the pass. Darren Sproles, Jordan Howard and Miles Sanders combined for 116 yards rushing.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe pass rush was an area of concern entering the season and the lack of pressure on Keenum was obvious. He was sacked once and had too much time in the pocket to pick apart the secondary. The Eagles need more from their front four to take the burden off the defensive backs.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nHoward averaged a team-high 7.3 yards per carry, finishing with 44 yards. He also reached down to make a nice grab on one of his two catches for 11 yards. Howard ran hard, was tough to bring down, and could see an increased workload.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nRasul Douglas got a slightly surprise start over Sidney Jones at one of the outside cornerback spots. Both got beaten by Terry McLaurin on deep passes, but Keenum overthrew the one pass that Jones had in coverage. Douglas was burned for a TD.\n\nINJURED\n\nDefensive tackle Malik Jackson, a key signing in free agency, suffered an injury to his left foot late in the game and wore a walking boot afterward. Pederson said the team is waiting for more test results but called the injury \u201csignificant\u201d and expects Jackson to miss a lot of time.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n12 of 13 - Wentz was 12 of 13 for 197 yards and three TDs on third down. The offense converted 11 of 17 third downs.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Eagles (1-0) hit the road to face the Atlanta Falcons (0-1) on Sunday night. Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and Co. are trying to avenge losses in Philly in a divisional-round playoff game two years ago and the NFL season opener in 2018.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carson Wentz shook off the rust quickly and DeSean Jackson provided the spark the Philadelphia Eagles needed to offset a shaky defense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Maaddi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/redskins_eagles_football_54868_c0-116-2767-1729_s1770x1032.jpg?67b72efc301f17ac5a6749c510aec6486b3f473a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
