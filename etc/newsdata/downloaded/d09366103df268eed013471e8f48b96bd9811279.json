Previously, Facebook only allowed users to enable or disable whether the social network used facial recognition software to suggest tagging them in photos. With the new expanded setting, users have the capability to toggle face recognition on or off for a wider array of uses, most of which Facebook did not specify.\n\n\u201c[The setting] provides an easy on or off switch for a broader set of uses of face recognition, such as helping you protect your identity on Facebook,\u201d Narayanan wrote.\n\nIn a help section linked from the settings menu, Facebook provides a clearer picture of what happens when you turn Face Recognition off. The company states that it will \u201cdelete your face recognition template\u201d which it uses to track your face across the platform.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t use face recognition to suggest that people tag you in photos,\u201d Facebook clarifies. \u201cThis means that you\u2019ll still be able to be tagged in photos, but we won\u2019t suggest tags based on a face recognition template.\u201d\n\nThe changes go into effect today for all Facebook users worldwide and will apply to new Facebook users as well. People still operating under \u201cTag Suggestions,\u201d Facebook\u2019s shorthand for facial recognition used to recommend tagging a user in photos, will see a notice in their News Feed notifying them of the change. Tag Suggestions will no longer be available.\n\nLast month, the FTC imposed a $5 billion fine on Facebook for deceptive privacy practices, including turning on \u201cTag Suggestions\u201d by default for new users while suggesting Facebook\u2019s facial recognition was opt-in.\n\nThe default mode of the new setting is opt-in, according to the post: \u201cIf you do nothing, face recognition will remain off for you.\u201d\n\nNarayanan attempted to polish Facebook\u2019s spotty recent privacy record in the first line of his blog post: \u201cFacebook has always given you control over whether we use face recognition technology to recognize you in photos.\u201d\n\nBut for nearly two years, some people had broader controls over how Facebook used their faces than others. The social network bestowed the on-off feature for facial recognition on \u201csome people\u201d in December 2017, according to the post, likely in a beta test.\n\nTo clear up suspicions about how Facebook is using facial recognition systems, Narayanan added that Facebook does not share facial data with third parties nor does it sell the technology.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to request for comment.", "description": "The FTC called Facebook\u2019s previous facial recognition system \u201cdeceptive.\u201d", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567539767/facebook-GettyImages-936215654_m3hk7o"}
