Robberies in central Cambridge, with an average household income of \u00a370,900 per annum, are up by almost 50 per cent.\n\nPolice leaders have attributed the rise to the impact of the county lines drugs trade, with more than 2,000 networks operating across the UK raking in up to \u00a3800,000 a year each.\n\nThe number of county lines operations \u2013 gangs from big cities expanding their operations to smaller towns using dedicated mobile phone lines to sell drugs \u2013 has increased from 720 in 2017 to more than 2,000 today.\n\nThe number of county lines operations \u2013 gangs from big cities expanding their operations to smaller towns using dedicated mobile phone lines to sell drugs \u2013 has increased from 720 in 2017 to more than 2,000 today (file image)\n\nSeparate figures published by the Office for National Statistics last week showed that there has been an 11 per cent year-on-year increase in robbery to 88,177 offences, or 242 a day.\n\nThe ONS said it was likely to have been caused by a rise in the number of robberies rather than any change in police recording practices.\n\nTheft has also risen by 11 per cent in the past two years with more than two million offences recorded between July 2018 to June 2019.\n\nPolice minister Kit Malthouse singled out county lines operations, saying: 'With 20,000 more police officers in the pipeline and urgent action on a number of fronts, not least drug-dealing county lines, we are making progress.\n\n'But there is a lot more to do and we have to get smarter and more focused.'\n\nYesterday, Anthony Stansfield, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Thames Valley, said: 'This shows the challenges of tackling drug crime are not limited to the big cities, which is why we have been calling on the Home Office to review the police funding formula... to tackle the very real problems we experience.'\n\nMichael Lane, the Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner, said: 'Whilst the figures highlighted refer to a very small number of low-level crimes, drug use on our streets does create fear and insecurities amongst residents.\n\n'County lines and criminals preying on the vulnerable is a security matter for us all. National, regional and local policing action is key.'", "description": "The number of robbery, theft and drug offences in the wealthiest districts is outstripping the national average by up to four times as criminal gangs branch out from urban areas.", "authors": ["Rebecca Camber Chief Crime Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19969894-0-image-a-87_1571613830765.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
