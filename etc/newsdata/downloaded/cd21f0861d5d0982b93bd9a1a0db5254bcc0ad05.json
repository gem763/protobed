Let me be simple and clear, this competition must be fair. The level of ambition of our future FTA [free-trade agreement] will clearly depend on [that],\" he said.\n\nOn the state of current talks, which U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week were making \"huge progress,\" Barnier gave a very different assessment. \"I see no reason today for optimism.\" But he added that \"work will continue at a technical level over the next days.\"\n\n\"I sometimes say Brexit is a school of patience and determination ... We are open to looking at the U.K.'s ideas and proposals,\" Barnier added.\n\nThe French politician said the EU has no ideological attachment to the backstop arrangement, which Johnson insists must be removed from the Withdrawal Agreement before the end of October. But Barnier added that \"concrete solutions\" are needed to avoid hard border checks on the Irish border. He did not offer an opinion on written proposals put forward by the British government last week, but described talks with Johnson in Luxembourg earlier this month as \"very useful and very cordial.\"\n\nBarnier was speaking at an event organized by the Association of German Newspaper Publishers and hosted by the CEO of Axel Springer, a co-owner of POLITICO Europe.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Barnier will meet Economy Minister Peter Altmaier and Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer \u2014 both members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democratic Union.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
