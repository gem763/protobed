And Peloton is not the the only company to falter since holding an IPO this year. High-profile names like Uber, Lyft and SmileDirectClub are all trading in the red, and following the WeWork IPO debacle, the Street is becoming less forgiving of companies that do not turn a profit \u2014 like Peloton.\n\n\"I feel like we're six or seven different companies in one,\" Peloton CEO John Foley told CNBC, but some have ridiculed the company after it claimed to be a \"technology, media, software, product, experience, fitness, design, retail, apparel [and] logistics\" company in its prospectus. The timing of its IPO was also somewhat unfortunate in that it coincided with many on the Street calling out WeWork for claiming to be a tech, rather than real estate, company.\n\nBut Komp believes that investors need to approach Peloton with a longer-term time horizon in mind given its loyal user base and growth prospects.\n\n\"Key satisfaction/engagement measures are very positive and we see a sizable potential market. While achieving GAAP profitability may prove difficult over the next ~5 years due to investments, PTON possesses substantial long-term sales/profit upside,\" he said in a note to clients.\n\nKomp acknowledges that the IPO was \"disappointing,\" but has a \"positive outlook\" for the company, especially if it delivers \"strong early results.\" His bottom line is that it was a \"broken IPO,\" but \"not a broken company.\"\n\nPeloton shares were up 2% early Wednesday.\n\nDisclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC's parent company NBCUniversal, is an investor in Peloton.", "description": "Baird initiated coverage of Peloton with an outperform rating and $28 target, saying that while the company might not be profitable for five years, there's a \"sizable potential market.\"", "authors": ["Pippa Stevens"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105826143-1554137108529robinarzon_5.jpg?v=1554137212", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
