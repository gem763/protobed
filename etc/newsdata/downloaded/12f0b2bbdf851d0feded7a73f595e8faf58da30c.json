He already had more than 100 scrimmage yards before halftime with 114, 66 rushing and 48 receiving. Jones was closing in on his career high of 172 scrimmage yards.\n\nJones grew up in El Paso in far West Texas and went to his hometown school at UTEP.\n\n\u2014 Schuyler Dixon reporting in Arlington, Texas\n\n___\n\n4:50 p.m.\n\nBroncos cornerback De\u2019Vante Bausby has been strapped to a backboard and taken off the field on a cart in the second quarter of Denver\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nBausby was hurt when he collided with Denver teammate Alexander Johnson while making a tackle on the Chargers\u2019 Austin Ekeler.\n\nThe defensive back didn\u2019t appear to be moving, but appeared to be talking to trainers while they helped him.\n\nSeveral Broncos knelt around Bausby while he was aided.\n\nThe third-year NFL pro signed with Denver in April. He made 11 tackles in the Broncos\u2019 first four games.\n\n\u2014 Greg Beacham reporting from Carson, California\n\n___\n\n3:55 p.m.\n\nChristian McCaffrey is having a special day for the Carolina Panthers.\n\nThe running back has 235 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns against the Jaguars, marking the fourth time in five games he has recorded at least 175 yards from scrimmage.\n\nMcCaffrey is currently on pace for 2,764 yards this season, which would shatter the NFL record set by Tennessee\u2019s Chris Johnson in 2009 (2,509).\n\n\u2014 Steven Reed reporting from Charlotte.\n\n___\n\n3:35 p.m.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater has thrown for a fourth touchdown against the Buccaneers beleaguered secondary to give New Orleans a 31-17 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Saints are finding all kinds of ways to pass against the Bucs. During their latest scoring drive, running back Alvin Kamara completed a 13-yard, first down pass to tight end Josh Hill. Earlier in the game, reserve QB Taysom Hill completed an 18 yard pass to star receiver Michael Thomas. Bridgewater, meanwhile, has a season high 300 yards passing as he looks to go 3-0 as a starter in place of the injured Drew Brees.\n\n\u2014 Brett Martel reporting from New Orleans\n\n___\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady has moved into third place on the NFL career list for passing yards.\n\nNew England\u2019s 42-year-old star passed Brett Favre, who compiled 71,838 yards with three teams. Brady surpassed that total in the third quarter against the Redskins on a 15-yard pass to Julian Edelman. That gave Brady 271 yards in the game and 71,846 over his brilliant career.\n\n\u2014 David Ginsburg reporting from Landover, Maryland\n\n___\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nGiants wide receiver Sterling Shepard was asked to leave the field with 4:04 left in the third quarter to be evaluated for a concussion.\n\nHe was shaken up falling to the ground trying to make a catch. He looked woozy. Shepard sustained a concussion in the season opener against Dallas and didn\u2019t tell anyone nor was it noticed.\n\n\u2014 Tom Canavan reporting from East Rutherford, New Jersey\n\n___\n\n3:10 p.m.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph left in the third quarter during Sunday\u2019s game against Baltimore after taking a hit to the head from Ravens safety Earl Thomas.\n\nRudolph had just released a pass to teammate James Washington when Thomas hit Rudolph in the chin. The quarterback fell to the Heinz Field turn and lay motionless on the turf. Thomas was flagged for roughing the passer on the play.\n\nRudolph was able to walk off the field after several minutes after trainers cut off his face mask. He was replaced by backup Devlin Hodges with the Steelers trailing 17-13.\n\n\u2014 Will Graves reporting from Pittsburgh\n\n___\n\n3:08 p.m.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles running back and punt returner Darren Sproles moved past Tim Brown into fifth place on the NFL\u2019s all-time list for all-purpose yards with a 4-yard return on a punt in the third quarter against the Jets.\n\nBrown had 19,682 yards. Jerry Rice is first at 23,546.\n\n\u2014 Rob Maaddi reporting from Philadelphia\n\n___\n\n2:55 p.m.\n\nThe Panthers inducted four former players into the Hall of Honor at halftime \u2014 quarterback Jake Delhomme, wide receiver Steve Smith, tight end Wesley Walls and offensive tackle Jordan Gross.\n\nThey join former linebacker Sam Mills and former team president Mike McCormack as the only members of the Hall of Honor in the team\u2019s 25-year history.\n\nSmith received the biggest ovation and during his speech said he never thought he would be able to wear the Panthers\u2019 No. 89 jersey again after being released late in his career. Smith then paused and peeled off his ceremonial Panthers blue jacket to reveal he was wearing his No. 89 jersey underneath, sending the crowd into hysterics. Smith then turned to Panthers owner David Tepper and said \u201cmake sure nobody wears that jersey again.\u201d\n\nDelhomme called it the greatest sporting day of his life and said \u201cNothing can be finer than to be in Carolina.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Steve Reed reporting from Charlotte, North Carolina\n\n___\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nThe New York Giants have lost another running back.\n\nWayne Gallman, who starting for the injured Saquon Barkley, has been knocked out of the Giants\u2019 game the Minnesota Vikings with a concussion.\n\nRookie Jon Hilliman, the Rutgers rookie who spent the first three weeks on the practice squad, has replaced Gallman. He apparently was hurt at the end of an 11-yard run in the first quarter.\n\nThe Giants came into the game with three running backs. Eli Penny is the other. He has been used as a blocker mostly with the Giants.\n\nBarkley sustained a high sprain to his right ankle against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sept. 15. He practiced on a limited basis on Friday but was ruled out.\n\n\u2014 Tom Canavan reporting from East Rutherford, New Jersey\n\n___\n\n2:30 p.m.\n\nThe Oakland Raiders are dominating the Chicago Bears at halftime in London.\n\nOakland has taken a 17-0 lead thanks to TD runs by Josh Jacobs and DeAndre Washington and have outgained Chicago 208-44 at the break. This matches Oakland\u2019s biggest lead at any point in a game since coach Jon Gruden returned last season.\n\nThe Raiders have controlled the matchup against their former star edge rusher Khalil Mack by rushing for 99 yards and allowing no sacks.\n\nOakland has three sacks of its own against backup quarterback Chase Daniel.\n\nThe performance might leave the Bears questioning their decision to arrive in London only two days before the game. The Raiders spent the entire week here.\n\n\u2014 Josh Dubow reporting from London\n\n___\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nOfficials have ejected Tampa Bay starting cornerback Carlton Davis from Sunday\u2019s game against New Orleans because of a heavy, blind hit to the helmet of tight end Jared Cook.\n\nDavis was assessed a 15-yard personal foul for the play and after a short delay the hit was judged to have been flagrant enough to warrant an ejection. The decision, coming in a 10-10 game in the second quarter, thinned the ranks of a Tampa Bay defensive backfield that entered the game ranked second to last in the NFL against the pass.\n\n\u2014 Brett Martel reporting from New Orleans\n\n___\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nThe Saints have ended a streak of 13 possessions without a touchdown and taken a 10-7 lead over Tampa Bay in the process.\n\nSaints quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, starting his third straight game for the injured Drew Brees, found Michael Thomas for a 14-yard catch and run to the left pylon for the score.\n\nIn Week 4, the Saints beat Dallas, 12-10, with four field goals. The Saints hadn\u2019t scored a TD since their second-to-last possession of a victory at Seattle in Week 3.\n\nBridgewater also has had his first completion longer that 30 yards this season against the Bucs, also to Thomas, who has five catches for 94 yards before the midway point of the second quarter.\n\n\u2014 Brett Martel reporting from New Orleans\n\n___\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nGiants running back Wayne Gallman is being evaluated for a concussion in the first quarter of New York\u2019s matchup with Minnesota.\n\nGallman started in place of injured starter Saquon Barkley (ankle), who is out for the second straight week. Gallman\u2019s injury leaves rookie Jon Hilliman to carry the load in the running game. Eli Penny is the other option with Barkley out\n\n\u2014Tom Canavan reporting from East Rutherford, New Jersey\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nThe winless Redskins have taken an early 7-6 lead over the unbeaten New England Patriots.\n\nWide receiver Steven Sims Jr. ran for a 65-yard touchdown on an end-around the right side. Washington has Colt McCoy at quarterback, who\u2019s seeing his first action since breaking his leg against Philadelphia last December. McCoy was sacked to end the Redskins\u2019 first possession, and Tom Brady was sacked to end New England\u2019s opening drive.\n\nThe Patriots quickly responded with a six-play, 75-yard drive capped by a 6-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Julian Edelman. But veteran kicker Mike Nugent, signed this week after Stephen Gostkowski was placed on injured reserve, missed the extra point wide right.\n\n\u2014 David Ginsburg reporting from Landover, Maryland\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nJosh Allen is back and starting for the Buffalo Bills.\n\nThe quarterback was in the concussion protocol after a helmet-to-helmet hit early in the fourth quarter of a 16-10 loss to New England last weekend. He was a limited participant in practice Wednesday and Thursday before practicing fully on Friday, when Buffalo listed his status as questionable.\n\nAllen has rallied the Bills from deficits in each of their three victories this season. Turnovers have been an issue. The second-year starter has thrown six interceptions and lost two fumbles.\n\nHe completed both passes on the Bills\u2019 opening drive for 23 yards. But he scrambled on third down and was sacked forcing Buffalo to punt.\n\n\u2014 Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n___\n\nKhalil Mack went all the way to Europe for a chance to sack his former teammate Derek Carr as the NFL kicks off the first of four games in London.\n\nMack and the Bears (3-1) enter Week 5 tied for first in the NFC South while the Raiders (2-2) are tied for second in the AFC West. Mack faces the Raiders at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium 13 months after being traded to Chicago following a contract dispute.\n\nMack has 17 sacks and 10 forced fumbles since joining the Bears last season compared to a Raiders defense that has just 18 sacks and eight forced fumbles from the entire unit.\n\nNext Sunday, NFC South rivals Carolina and Tampa Bay will also play at Tottenham. It\u2019s already their second meeting of the season after the Buccaneers beat the Panthers 20-14 on Thursday night in Week 2.\n\nIn Week 8, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor, the former quarterbacks coach for the Rams, will lead Cincinnati as it faces the NFC champions in Wembley Stadium.\n\nAnd in Week 9, the London games conclude as Houston plays its first game in London in an AFC South matchup against Jacksonville, which will be playing its seventh annual \u201chome\u201d game in the city. This will also be the second matchup of the season for the teams. Houston won the first meeting 13-12 in Week 2 as the Jaguars failed on a late 2-point conversion attempt.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "The Latest on NFL Week 5 (all times EDT) 6:55 p.m. Green Bay running back Aaron Jones keeps building on a career day at the Dallas Cowboys.
