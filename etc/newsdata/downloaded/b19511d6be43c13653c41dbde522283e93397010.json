The articles alleged that the commission had sent Zuma an 11-page document filled with 80 questions ahead of his next appearance.\n\n\u201cThe chairperson [Judge Zondo] raised the commission\u2019s concerns about the article at the hearing on Tuesday, October 8, and made it clear that the statements in the article that the commission had sent Mr Zuma questions in advance of his appearance before it is simply factually untrue. It must also be stated that the commission has never agreed to furnish Mr Zuma with any questions in advance,\u201d the statement said.\n\nInstead, the commission has said that the document was sent to Zuma\u2019s legal team and outlined the areas of interest which were agreed upon on July 19.\n\nZuma is expected to appear at the commission later this month.", "description": "The commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture has finally released the areas of interest around which former president Jacob Zuma will be cross-examined when he next appears before it.", "authors": ["Mandisa Nyathi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9155/6246775ec199442883f53cd0630f2456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
