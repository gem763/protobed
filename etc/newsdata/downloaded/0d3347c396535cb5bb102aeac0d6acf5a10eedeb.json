USA TODAY\n\nThe thing we too often forget is that college football is a game played by young men who are not yet at their physical peak, who must spend time every week going to math or history classes and who aren\u2019t paid to perform.\n\nIn other words, they\u2019re sometimes going to look like college kids \u2014 which is, technically, what they are.\n\nThat\u2019s about the only fair way to explain Florida 24, Auburn 13 in a game that was tense, sloppy, mistake-filled, oddly coached and generally impossible to figure out from possession to possession.\n\nAfter four turnovers apiece and a whole bunch of other weirdness, it was No. 8 Florida blowing the game open on Lamical Perine\u2019s 88-yard touchdown run with 9:04 remaining, giving the Gators a terrific win and a 6-0 record despite some very clear flaws.\n\nAnd for No. 7 Auburn, it was a reality check about life with a true freshman quarterback in Bo Nix, who seemed rather overwhelmed with the whole thing and made some truly terrible decisions under pressure.\n\nFlorida defensive lineman Tedarrell Slaton (56) and teammates celebrate after defeating Auburn. (Photo: Douglas DeFelice, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAuburn played poorly, no doubt, gaining just 269 yards of offense in the Swamp and committing nine penalties. And maybe it was bound to happen, as the series of tough opponents the Tigers had to tackle early in the season left their tank a little bit empty going into Gainesville.\n\nBut it would be silly to write off Auburn at this point. The defense is real and created all kinds of havoc for Florida. Nix will get better, and he\u2019s got a bye week coming at a really good time. Auburn should be recharged by the time it plays at LSU on Oct. 26, and don\u2019t forget the Tigers will have Georgia and Alabama at home.\n\nIn the end, though, the only real takeaway from that game is that you never know what you\u2019re going to get with college players. Unlike the NFL, where everything is buttoned up and mistakes are kept to a minimum, college games can take a turn into crazyville. But that\u2019s also why we love it.\n\nWeek 6: Winners and losers led by Michigan\n\nHere are nine other takeaways from Week 6 in college football:\n\nThe Buckeyes handled their first real challenge\n\nThough No. 5 Ohio State had looked terrific on both sides of the ball over the first five weeks of the season, its marshmallow-soft schedule had left some lingering questions about what those blowout scores really meant.\n\nBut in their first test against a good team, the Buckeyes still looked pretty dominant, putting away No. 23 Michigan State 34-10 in Columbus. Though Ohio State didn\u2019t get off to a flying start on offense, it scored touchdowns on three straight possessions in the second quarter and was able to run the ball pretty effectively behind J.K. Dobbins, who had 172 yards on 24 carries. Quarterback Justin Fields was solid against the first top-quality defense he\u2019s seen as a starter, completing 17-of-25 passes for 206 yards with two touchdowns and mostly taking what Michigan State gave him rather than trying to force the issue. (Fields did throw his first interception of the season trying to force something off the back foot.)\n\nAlthough Michigan State is probably no more than a borderline top-25 team, this is how you\u2019re supposed to look if you\u2019re a real contender to win the national championship. The Buckeyes have a bunch of new players in key positions and a first-year head coach in Ryan Day, but they look remarkably organized and smooth for this early in the season \u2014 with plenty of room to still improve.\n\nThe Pac-12 averted disaster\n\nWith Oregon trailing Cal for much of the evening in Eugene, the Pac-12 was facing its worst-case scenario for the College Football Playoff. With Cal having already beaten Washington earlier this year, the Bears would have held tiebreakers over both of the still-alive playoff contenders while not really being one themselves. Needless to say, Cal winning the Pac-12 North would have basically meant a third straight year being shut out of the Playoff.\n\nMore: Oregon running back Cyrus Habibi-Likio tackles fan who ran onto the field\n\nBut the Pac-12 got a huge sigh of relief when Oregon finally scored a touchdown late in the third quarter and held on for a 17-7 win. Though the Ducks still look fairly sloppy on offense, they\u2019re 4-1 and still on track for an Oct. 19 meeting at Washington that will loom large if they can both win out.\n\nOklahoma State turned in its annual stinker\n\nAs much success as Mike Gundy has had at his alma mater, his program is developing a rather odd habit of turning in one completely out-of-nowhere brutal performance per season against an unranked opponent. In 2016, it was a home loss to Central Michigan. In 2017, the Cowboys were ranked No. 10 and got swamped at home by Kansas State, trailing by as many as 29 points in the third quarter. Then last season, Oklahoma State was 3-0 after a big win over Boise State only to lose 41-17 at home the very next week to Texas Tech. And Saturday, the Red Raiders were able to pull the upset again, jetting out to a 27-7 lead and holding on for a 45-35 win.\n\nWhen you\u2019re minus-5 in the turnover battle as 25th-ranked Oklahoma State was on Saturday \u2014 including three interceptions from quarterback Spencer Sanders \u2014 you\u2019re not going to beat anyone. But also, Texas Tech racked up 586 yards of offense, which is quite a lot for a team that didn\u2019t do much with the ball last week against Oklahoma and scored just 14 earlier this year against Arizona.\n\nOklahoma State is certainly going to factor into the Big 12 race, if for no other reason than its tendency to play well against good teams makes them a scary matchup. But the inconsistency, particularly against teams Oklahoma State should be beating, is starting to take some shine off what Gundy accomplished during his prime years from 2010-16.\n\nWest Virginia is winning respect\n\nThe Mountaineers didn\u2019t beat No. 12 Texas on Saturday, but their 42-31 loss was the kind that should earn them a lot of respect for how far they\u2019ve come this season. It appeared early this season like Neal Brown inherited a real roster mess from Dana Holgorsen, whose best players last year went to the NFL. But the Mountaineers have really improved in a pretty short time, notching wins over N.C. State and Kansas before giving the Longhorns a real fight in Morgantown.\n\nMore: 6-7, 300-pound Texas offensive lineman scores touchdown vs. West Virginia on trick play\n\nWest Virginia put up 463 yards on a banged-up Texas defense but was undone by four interceptions from quarterback Austin Kendall and a couple missed field goals early on when the game was in doubt.\n\nBut even in defeat, West Virginia has served notice that it won\u2019t be an easy out in the Big 12. And in the bigger picture, what Mountaineer fans have seen the last few weeks should be reassuring that they hired the right guy in the 39-year-old Brown, whose first season at Troy in 2015 looked similar in terms of improvement and competitiveness even though the team won just four games. Brown went on to notch three double-digit win seasons before going to West Virginia, and now he\u2019s got a more national platform to show that he\u2019s a quality head coach.\n\nTulane looks like a legit AAC threat\n\nAmong the 28 FBS coaching changes that followed the 2015 season, few have looked better in retrospect than Tulane grabbing Willie Fritz from Georgia Southern. Though Fritz had dominated the Sun Belt during his two years there, losing just two conference games and going 17-7 overall, he didn\u2019t get a ton of interest from the Power Five. Perhaps that was a product of the option-hybrid offense he ran in Statesboro, which carries a stigma for big-time schools. Or maybe it was Fritz\u2019s coaching pedigree, which had been built on years of toiling in Div. II and the FCS.\n\nBut give Tulane athletics director Troy Dannen full credit for recognizing that Fritz could turn around the Green Wave\u2019s floundering program, a promise he has fully delivered on in his fourth season. After a 42-33 win at Army on Saturday, Tulane looks like a sneaky contender in the suddenly rugged AAC West alongside Memphis and SMU and could very well land in the Top 25 for the first time since 1998.\n\nUntil this season, the most noticeable thing about Tulane had been its uniforms, which almost always look terrific with alternate helmet logos and a heavy dose of powder blue. But now the football product is getting some traction, starting two weeks ago in its 38-31 win over Houston with a fake kneel-down play at the end of regulation followed by a 53-yard touchdown pass with three seconds left. But winning in West Point, where Army hasn\u2019t lost since Nov. 5, 2016, adds some real heft to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Alongside a competitive 24-6 loss at Auburn in Week 2, Tulane looks on track to have its best season since at least 2002 when it won eight games.\n\nMichigan-Iowa should never be spoken of again\n\nCan we just forget that ever happened? If you\u2019re a fan of aesthetically pleasing football, you weren\u2019t going to find it in Ann Arbor as No. 18 Michigan plodded to a 10-3 win. You rarely see a game these days where neither team reaches 300 yards of offense, but Michigan finished with 267 and 14th-ranked Iowa had 261 with just one net yard rushing. Both quarterbacks played poorly in this one, but Iowa\u2019s Nate Stanley went 23-for-42 with three interceptions while also taking eight sacks. And despite all that, Iowa was driving to potentially tie the game inside the final five minutes with a first down at Michigan\u2019s 25-yard line. But then, the Hawkeyes went into full circus mode, committing back-to-back holding penalties, getting called for an ineligible man downfield and then a false start to back themselves into third-and-24. To put the cherry on top, Stanley was sacked to remove any possibility of a field-goal attempt. When you botch one of your few promising drives that badly, you don\u2019t deserve to win.\n\nUCF\u2019s amazing run is over\n\nThough it probably shouldn\u2019t have been a huge surprise, it was nonetheless a landmark result Friday night when Cincinnati held off No. 19 UCF, 27-24, delivering the Knights\u2019 first conference loss since the final regular season game of the 2016 season. It also ends an era, in a sense, given the prominent place UCF has had in the national college football discussion.\n\nNo matter how you felt about the Knights declaring themselves national champions in 2017 or arguing that they deserved a spot in the College Football Playoff last year or campaigning for a higher ranking this season after they dominated Stanford, let\u2019s be very clear: UCF has been extremely relevant for the last two-plus years.\n\nThough some of the aggressive tactics from athletics director Danny White to put UCF in the conversation irritated his colleagues around the country, the Knights lost nothing from becoming a polarizing program. In fact, if anything, they elevated their profile around the country and sparked some interesting and important debates about whether four teams is enough for the playoff.\n\nNow, those conversations will be hard to have. UCF\u2019s second loss will make it almost impossible for them to be the Group of Five representative in a New Year\u2019s Six bowl game. Moreover, there\u2019s not much of a gap this year between the Knights and the other top teams in the AAC, which means they could very well lose again and currently wouldn\u2019t be favored to win the conference title. That means the spotlight ends, at least for now. But it was a heck of a ride.\n\nArizona is just fine after all\n\nThere were some ominous rumblings coming out of Tucson after Arizona\u2019s season-opening loss at Hawaii, but credit Kevin Sumlin and the Wildcats for bouncing back and putting themselves in pretty good position to be a factor in the Pac-12 South at 4-1 overall and 2-0 in the league.\n\nOne of the draws for quarterback Khalil Tate to stay at Arizona after Rich Rodriguez was fired a couple years ago was the chance to play in a system where he could develop his passing skills. It seems to be paying off, as Tate threw for a career-high 404 yards on 31-of-41 completions Saturday in a 35-30 win at Colorado.\n\nThings are about to get much tougher for the Wildcats, who host Washington next Saturday and then go to USC after that. But for a program that was pretty underwhelming in Sumlin\u2019s first season at 5-7, getting some of these early wins will remove some doubts about whether Arizona hired the right coach.\n\nMemphis has another insane running back\n\nOver the last three years, running back Darrell Henderson made Memphis one of the nation\u2019s must-watch teams due to his sheer ability to explode through holes and accelerate away from defenders for long touchdown runs. Henderson had some truly absurd games, breaking the 200-yard mark three times last season and posted a per-carry average of 8.9 yards over his final two seasons before going to the NFL.\n\nNow it appears No. 23-ranked Memphis has a player in the same mold in fellow Mississippi product Kenneth Gainwell, who has announced himself as a potential star through the first five games of his career. In Memphis\u2019 52-33 win Saturday at Louisiana-Monroe, Gainwell finished with 209 yards on just 14 carries, including touchdown runs of 68 and 40 yards. Gainwell had 104 yards on 14 carries last week against Navy and 145 yards on 16 touches against South Alabama, where he took over the starting job due to Patrick Taylor\u2019s injury.\n\nTo date, Gainwell is averaging 8.2 yards every time he takes a handoff, which puts him very much on a Henderson-like pace.", "description": "Florida's win over Auburn was proof you never really know what you're going to get from college players, and other lessons learned from Week 6.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published A.M.
