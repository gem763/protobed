To confirm it was him, they stole a pair of al-Baghdadi\u2019s underwear \u2014 long, white boxers \u2014 and obtained a blood sample, both for DNA testing, the force\u2019s commander, Mazlum Abdi, said in a phone interview Monday.\n\nU.S. officials would not discuss the specific intelligence provided by the Kurds, but said that their role in finding al-Baghdadi was essential \u2014 more so than all other countries combined, as one put it \u2014 contradicting President Donald Trump\u2019s assertion over the weekend that the United States \u201cgot very little help.\u201d\n\nYet even as the Syrian Kurdish fighters were risking their lives in the hunt that led to al-Baghdadi\u2019s death this weekend, Trump abruptly shattered a five-year U.S. partnership with them.\n\nHe decided to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, leaving the Kurds suddenly vulnerable to an invasion by Turkey and feeling stung by an American betrayal, and throwing the al-Baghdadi operation into turmoil as the Kurds suspended their security cooperation with the United States to rush off and defend their land.\n\n\u201cWe thought that America would keep its promises,\u201d said Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. \u201cBut in the end there was weakness \u2014 and disappointment.\u201d\n\nThe United States joined forces with Abdi\u2019s group five years ago, when it was looking for skilled Syrian fighters who could effectively serve as ground troops for a U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State. As the alliance matured, the United States armed and trained Kurdish-led fighters and pressed them to shift their priorities to serve U.S. interests.\n\nThe United States pushed them to take the fight against ISIS to areas outside their traditional homeland, costing them many lives. It also discouraged them from negotiating a deal with the Syrian government, telling them that sticking with the United States would win them a stake in the country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWe said being associated with the U.S. coalition would put you in a position where you would be represented,\u201d Gen. Joseph L. Votel, former head of the military\u2019s Special Operations and Central commands, said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019d be on the winning team.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to placate Turkey, the United States convinced the Kurds to destroy their defenses, softening them up for a Turkish attack. It also sought their help in the United States\u2019 regional struggle with Iran, a cause they had little stake in.\n\nFor the Kurdish-led forces, the sting was not that U.S. troops were withdrawing from Syria, which they knew would happen eventually. It was that after five years of their fighting and dying alongside U.S. troops in the battle against ISIS, Trump pulled the plug so suddenly that they were ill-prepared for what came next.\n\n\u201cIt was a stab in the back,\u201d said Nesrin Abdullah, a spokeswoman for the Kurdish women\u2019s militia. \u201cThe Americans kept saying they would not allow the Turks to enter, but in the end that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem was that U.S. officials sent conflicting messages about how long the United States would stay in Syria and what it was doing there.\n\nObama administration officials told their Kurdish allies that the partnership would last through the defeat of ISIS, but that the United States would help them play a role in Syria\u2019s future. That message grew even more muddled over the last year, as Trump vowed to withdraw U.S. troops while other officials in his administration said they would stay until Iran had left the country and there was a political solution in Damascus.\n\nWhile there may not have been explicit promises, to the Kurds these messages pointed to a continued U.S. presence. In fact, even during the weeks before the withdrawal, U.S. diplomats were advising them on programs to improve governance and security \u2014 topics that did not suggest an imminent rush for the exit.\n\nThe swift dissolution of a powerful partnership, reconstructed here through more than a dozen interviews with United States and Kurdish officials, pained not only Syria\u2019s Kurds but also Americans who worked with them to defeat the Islamic State.", "description": "QAMISHLI, Syria -- When the international manhunt for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, zoomed in on a village in northwestern Syria, the United States turned to its local allies to help track the world's most-wanted terrorist.The U.S. allies, a Kurdish-led force that had partnered", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard", "Eric Schmitt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fshBXM2NtUIoT1an3t0p1w--~B/aD0yMjAwO3c9MzMwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/7ce8b520865fdf37cbdc3abd61c30112", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
