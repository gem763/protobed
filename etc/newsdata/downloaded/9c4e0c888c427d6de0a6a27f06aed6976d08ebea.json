(Mike Segar/Reuters)\n\nAccording to the latest Marquette Law School poll of registered voters in Wisconsin, Joe Biden leads Donald Trump 51 percent to 42 percent, while Elizabeth Warren and Trump are tied at 45 percent. Trump is also tied with Kamala Harris at 44 percent, while Bernie Sanders narrowly leads Trump 48 percent to 44 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Marquette survey is another data point backing up the argument that Biden is actually more electable than his Democratic rivals. He leads Trump by 9.4 points in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, while Warren leads Trump by 3.6 points in the RCP average and Harris leads by 3.0.\n\nIn 2016, of course, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.1 points, but lost the Electoral College because 78,000 voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan gave Trump the edge.\n\nTrump can afford to let Pennsylvania and Michigan flip in 2020, but he would still win the Electoral College 270 to 268 if he holds Wisconsin and the rest of the 2016 map stays the same.\n\nWisconsin remains a strong contender to be the \u201ctipping-point\u201d state in the Electoral College in 2020, and Biden will likely be touting the fact that the \u201cgold-standard\u201d pollster in Wisconsin shows him with a big lead, while his rivals would make the race a toss-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden\u2019s rivals can counter by pointing out that at this point in the 2016 presidential race (when Trump had been running in the GOP primary for less than three months) Marquette showed Hillary Clinton leading Trump 51 percent to 35 percent.", "description": "According to the latest Marquette poll, Joe Biden leads Donald Trump 51 percent to 42 percent, while Elizabeth Warren and Trump are tied at 45 percent.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Andrew C.
