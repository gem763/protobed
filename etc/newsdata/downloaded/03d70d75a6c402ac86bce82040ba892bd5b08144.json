Those of you who are part of that crowd might be more interested in the Surface Pro. It's a Windows 10 convertible, and at this price, it's hard to ignore.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot for $22 ($28 off)\n\nSee it now: Amazon Echo Dot\n\nLet's be real: Amazon's smallest Echo is always on sale.

The possibilities are endless with Alexa devices.\n\nAmazon Echo for $50 ($50 off)\n\nSee it now: Amazon Echo\n\nOf course, if you desire more sound quality from your Echo, there's also the bigger, more powerful Echo on sale at Best Buy.\n\nAmazon Kindle Oasis for $204 ($75 off)\n\nSee it now: Amazon Kindle Oasis\n\nIt's always a good idea to pick up a Kindle if you can find a good deal. These e-readers offer an e-ink reading experience and fewer distractions than you'd get with a tablet such as the Fire HD 7. It also provides access to Amazon's massive library of ebooks.\n\nSony XB950N1 headphones for $150 ($100 off)\n\nSee it now: Sony XB950N1\n\nOpen offices have perks, but there are also downsides, such as the constant distractions and noisy environment.

They're nearly half off and worth every cent.\n\nWD 1TB My Passport SSD + 64GB USB drive for $130 ($40 off)\n\nSee it now: WD My Passport + USB drive combo\n\nCloud storage is all the rage right now, but some of us still prefer to back up all our work files and personal files on local storage. And with this combination deal, you can do just that -- on not only an SSD but also a flash drive.\n\nHP OfficeJet Pro 6968 wireless printer for $60 ($90 off)\n\nSee it now: HP OfficeJet Pro 6968\n\nPrinters aren't as flashy as an iPad or Echo, but they're necessary for work, and this one is 60% off during Best Buy's three-day sale.\n\nFor more great deals on devices, gadgetry, and tech for your enterprise, business, or home office, see ZDNet's Business Bargain Hunter blog.
