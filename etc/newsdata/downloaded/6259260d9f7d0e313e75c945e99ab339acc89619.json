USA TODAY\n\nSTEVENS POINT, Wis.\u2014 Two Democratic activists in this swing district knocked on the door to the home of one of the big white whales of the 2020 election cycle: The elusive Obama-to-Trump voter.\n\nHayley Bird, a canvasser from the local College Democrats club, introduced herself and asked the voter a neutrally-worded question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the most important issue we\u2019re facing as a state or country?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s psychotic,\u201d responded 68-year-old Alvin White, referring to President Donald Trump. He then told Bird he voted for Trump in 2016 after twice casting ballots for Obama.\n\nWhite grumbled that he was embarrassed by the president\u2019s attempt to buy Greenland, insistence on building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and frequent provocative rhetoric to the news media and on Twitter.\n\nBut when Bird\u2019s fellow canvasser Joan Garski asked White to rate Trump on a scale of 1 (awful) to 10 (awesome), the retiree was more charitable.\n\n\u201cI would give him a 5,\u201d said White, who added he was leaning toward voting for former Vice President Joe Biden in 2020 if he wins the Democratic nomination but was less enthusiastic about the rest of the field. \u201cI got to give Trump credit \u2014 the job market is doing pretty good.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa caucuses that will kick off the Democratic nomination fight are still more than three months away.\n\nBut already top Democratic Party officials are looking down the road and shaping their strategy to win back voters like White in the general election. In the process, they\u2019re posing a bigger question that's pivotal no matter who they nominate: What will it take to beat Trump in November 2020?\n\nIn this Oct. 26, 2018 file photo, former President Barack Obama poses with Democrats after speaking at a rally in support of Wisconsin Democratic candidates, in Milwaukee.

(Photo: Morry Gash, AP)\n\nFour states in particular \u2014 Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 are seen as among the most pivotal for Democrats to move back into their column. Trump carried all four in 2016 by a combined margin of less than 200,000 votes after Barack Obama won all of them in both 2008 and 2012.\n\nAnd Democrats also are dealing with a new dynamic in the race after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry of Trump over allegations that he abused his power by pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden, one of his top political rivals, and the former vice president's son, Hunter Biden. Trump has insisted he did nothing improper.\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed more than two dozen Democratic National Committee officials, county Democratic chairpersons, elected officials and rank-and-file activists in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin about the path to victory. They highlighted an increased effort on the ground in early states, a desire to make the message to voters more issue-driven, and warned against ignoring voters who may have been overlooked in 2016.\n\nHere is how they think the Democrats can win.\n\nDeveloping a robust ground game\n\nThe old adage \"it comes down to turnout\" is clich\u00e9 \u2014 but true. And to drive turnout, you have to have people on the ground, making contact with voters.\n\nDNC officials say they have identified seven battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 that Trump won in 2016 for special focus. The party is in the midst of hiring 1,000 organizers across those states to try to turn the tide.\n\nThe DNC has also purchased nearly 7 million voter cell phone numbers in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as they attempt to bolster data bases and reach more voters in those key states, officials said.\n\nAnd after a falloff in black voter participation in 2016, the DNC has put an early emphasis on voter outreach in communities of color. That includes a multi-million dollar investment by the DNC and progressive partners to recruit, pay and train young voter outreach workers in black and Latino communities in places like Milwaukee and Philadelphia, where minority turnout is key to Democrats\u2019 hopes of winning Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump won by nearly 11,000 votes in 2016, marking the first time a Republican presidential nominee took the state since George H.W. Bush in 1988.\n\n\u201cI will own the party\u2019s part in falling short in 2016,\u201d said Lavora Barnes, the Michigan Democratic Party chairwoman. \u201cWhat we did not do is prepare ourselves to run a ground game. We sat back and waited for the national campaign \u2014 waited for the nominee to be chosen and then tried to stand up a campaign right around the time of the convention. It was too late. We have vowed as a party that that will never let this happen to us again.\u201d\n\nWhen talking to voters, Brian Kerrigan, chairman of the Marquette County Democratic Committee, said activists and candidates need to stay focused on bread-and-butter issues where Trump has fallen short \u2014 including failure to get an infrastructure deal, slow wage growth and trade wars that have complicated business for farmers and manufacturers in the Rust Belt.\n\nHe and elected Democrats throughout the sprawling 100-square mile county in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have begun to hold listening tours to ask voters what issues are most important to them, with the intent of filtering up that information to state Democrats and eventually the national party.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took Marquette County by four points in 2016 but won about 2,000 fewer votes than Obama did in 2012. If activists can help the 2020 Democratic nominee pick up even a few hundred votes more than Clinton did, it could prove to be significant in changing the fate of Michigan in 2020, Kerrigan said.\n\nRonald Reagan posed to voters in his successful 1980 run against Jimmy Carter: Are you better off than four years ago? How the electorate has answered that question has largely determined whether incumbent presidents since the 40th president have been ultimately successful in winning reelection.\n\nKerrigan countered that Trump\u2019s booming economy has not helped many working-class Americans. \u201cThe better question is, \u2018Where do we want to go in our communities, in our state and in the country,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMore: Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide\n\nTrump, for his part, has attempted to keep the spotlight on a strong economy. Unemployment is hovering near 50 year low and the economy grew by a solid 2.5% last year, but still short of the 3% growth Trump promised with his push for tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nTrump has lashed out at Pelosi over the impeachment inquiry and slammed the opposing party as \u201cdo nothing Democrats\u201d pursuing impeachment because they fear running against him on the issue of the economy.\n\nHe'll have a huge war chest to make his pitch to voters.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced it jointly raised $125 million with the Trump reelection campaign in the third quarter of this year alone. Trump broke precedent by starting to fundraise for his reelection immediately after his 2017 inauguration.\n\n\"When you have the president announce his reelect early and when you have the RNC chairwoman (Ronna McDaniel) raising record amounts of money every single month,\" said Rick Gorka, the RNC's communication director for battleground states, it allows you to reinvest more into the data and the ground game.\"\n\nOpinion: Trump raids military families, national security to pay for border wall: Vets in Congress\n\nPresident Donald Trump participates a briefing on Hurricane Dorian in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on September 4, 2019. (Photo: MICHAEL REYNOLDS, EPA-EFE)\n\nIt can't be just about Trump\n\nWhile pointing out where Democrats believe Trump has failed may resonate with some voters, voters and activists also said candidates need to talk about more than just the president.\n\nTo varying degrees, top-tier Democratic candidates have sought to flip the script and define Trump as a candidate who may have been good for the rich but bad for workers, the environment, women and minorities.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has repeatedly warned on the campaign trail that every time Democrats are talking about Trump, they\u2019re missing an opportunity to talk about the lives of voters.\n\nBiden \u2014 who in recent days has found himself spending a fair amount of energy pushing back against Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations of misdeeds in Ukraine by him and his son \u2014 has centered his campaign as an attempt restore \u201cthe soul of this country,\u201d to bolster the middle class and to unify the nation.\n\nElizabeth Warren, the first major Democratic candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, has told voters they need to demand their elected officials are doing more than talking about their differences with Trump. The election of the president in 2016 was a symptom of a greater illness, she\u2019s argued.\n\n\u201cThis dark moment requires more than being \u2018not Trump\u2019, because a country that elects someone like Donald Trump is a country that\u2019s already in serious trouble,\u201d Warren said in a speech at last month's Massachusetts Democratic Convention.\n\nDemocratic Party activists Hayley Bird (right) and Joan Garski canvass in Stevens Point, Wis. more than 13 months before the 2020 presidential election. (Photo: Aamer Madhani)\n\nAs Bird and Garski canvassed in Stevens Point on the recent afternoon, they heard less outrage from voters about the president and more anxiety about whether Trump \u2014 and politicians in Washington writ large \u2014 are in tune with what\u2019s keeping average Americans up at night.\n\nOne voter, John Strassburg, told the canvassers he was concerned about states tightening voter identification rules \u2014 creating roadblocks for many Americans, particularly minorities and low-income people, who want to cast their ballots. \u201cBefore anything else we have to improve voter registration laws,\u201d he said.\n\nKody Lutz told Garski and Bird he was concerned about the trickle-down effect of Trump\u2019s trade war with China on Wisconsin businesses and his livelihood.\n\nHe works at one of 11 railroad companies that operate in the state and he\u2019s anxious as railway traffic has slowed down. Total U.S. carload traffic for the first nine months of 2019 was down 3.8% from the same period last year, according to the American Association Railroads. The railroad group says the slowdown is due in part to trade uncertainty.\n\n\u201cPeople at work have been talking about layoffs,\u201d Lutz told Garski and Bird.\n\nDonald Trump supporters gather outside of an arena in Manchester before a scheduled evening rally by Trump on August 15, 2019 in Manchester, New Hampshire. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nGary Stark, chairman of the Kent County Democratic Party in western Michigan, said the eventual nominee needs to remind voters about the failures of the Trump administration and spend less energy on outrage over the president's bluster, misstatements and lies.\n\n\"In his victory he speech, he said he was going to be president of all the country, we know where that's gone,\" Stark said. \"Things like reminding voters that he said Mexico is going to pay for the wall, I think, might have more traction. We should remind voters of the trade war and the impact it's having on things, the impact of the trade war on farmers, the impact of his failure of action on health care. I think if we stay focused on what his failed promises are doing to average people it will have more impact voters.\"\n\nCome to voters where they are\n\nBert Sise, Democratic County chairwoman in Monroe County, Fla., recently had an older acquaintance and once-staunch Trump backer approach her to tell her he\u2019s finally had it with Trump.\n\nThe last straw was the administration\u2019s decision to postpone more than 100 Pentagon projects \u2014 including nine schools for troops' children and repairs to military facilities damaged by hurricanes in Puerto Rico \u2014 so the president could divert about $3.6 billion to his long sought after border wall.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made some conversions, as I like to call them,\u201d Sise said. \u201cFor some of them, the scales are dropping from their eyes, but not enough in my estimation. There are still those who think he can do no wrong, and they say if he does wrong, they say, \u2018Who cares?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut at the same time, Sise said that Trump has been a \u201cgreat recruiter for the Democratic party.\u201d\n\nIn her county that includes the Florida Keys \u2014 an area Obama took by about five percentage points in 2008 but Trump won by 7 points in 2016 \u2014 Sise said there are signs that Democrats can turn things around.\n\nHer committee\u2019s meetings \u2014 Democrats hold three meetings a month in the different parts of the sprawling county \u2014 used to attract only about 10 people but now regularly attract dozens.\n\nSise, 71, who spent more than 30 years managing a truck terminal, said she feels some optimism for Democrats, because Trump \u201csteps on his (penis) every day\u201d and demonstrates a penchant for offending huge parts of the electorate.\n\n\u201cDemocrats and the nominee need to remember: Don\u2019t talk down to people,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Hillary had a problem with that. The nominee needs to be genuine, and find a way to show them how our policies relate to them. And on the ground game, we need to make sure we train our people to make the argument without getting into a pissing contest.\u201d\n\nVaughn Derderian, the Oakland County, Michigan, Democratic Party chairman, said Democrats too often suffer from a measure of arrogance that \u201cbecause our ideas are better, we will win.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 midterms offer Democrats a measure of confidence about their chances of turning the state blue in again 2020.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, cruised to victory, winning by more than 400,000 votes. The party also flipped two Republican-held U.S. House seats. And incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow's margin of victory was more than 4 points higher in Michigan counties that Clinton won in 2016 than the presidential nominee. Meanwhile, her Republican opponent\u2019s margin of victory in Trump counties was nearly 9 percentage less.\n\nBut Derderian thinks about his own overconfidence in a state House race he worked on in 2018. The day before the 2018 midterms, Derderian sat in the living room of his candidate reviewing early her voting metrics that suggested his candidate should take the race. The next day, his candidate lost.\n\n\u201cI think we have to always be looking in the rearview mirror,\u201d Derderian said. \u201cNo matter how comfortably we think we should be able to win, we should spend everyday thinking that we\u2019re on the edge of losing.\u201d\n\nBadger State Poll: Fox News poll shows Trump nine points behind Biden in Wisconsin, a key swing state\n\nMonster GOP haul: Trump campaign, RNC to report record $125 million third quarter fundraising haul\n\nBe careful who you ignore\n\nIn places like Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, and Seminole County, Fla., Democratic officials say the electorate offers a near perfect mirror of the United State population as a whole, but place like these get short shrift from Democratic candidates.\n\nDauphin, which includes the state capital of Harrisburg, is by many measures the statistically closest to resembling American as a whole, according a study the Washington-based political research firm Echelon Insight.\n\nThe county went for Clinton by 2.9 percentage points, while the popular vote margin in the country as a whole was 2.1 points. The median household income is $54,968, just off the national average of $57,805. Just more than 29% of adults over 25 graduated from college, compared to the national average of 30.3%. At 47.8%, the percentage of the population that belonged to a religious congregation in 2010 is very close to the national average of 48.8%, the Echelon study notes.\n\n\u201cMy advice to candidates is take notice of all of Pennsylvania and just don\u2019t spend all your time in Philadelphia,\u201d said Rogette Harris, the Dauphin County Democratic Committee chairwoman.\n\nBrittany Nethers, the Democratic committee chairwoman in central Florida\u2019s Seminole County, said that whoever is the party\u2019s presidential nomination would do well by following the lead of 2018 gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and his approach in her neck of the woods.\n\nThe county, which includes the growing suburbs north of Orlando, was once solidly Republican but Democrats have made headway as the area has become more diverse. The county ranked as the seventh most representative of the U.S. as a whole in the Echelon study.\n\nTrump took Seminole County by 1.5 percentage points in 2016, while the GOP nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, took the county by more than six percentage points.\n\nGillum, the former Tallahassee, Fla., mayor, managed to win the county by two percentage points in the 2018 gubernatorial race in which he narrowly lost the state to Rep. Ron DeSantis. In 2014, then-Republican Gov. Rick Scott won the county by more than seven percentage points.\n\n\u201cHaving the candidates come to these areas \u2014 not just the main cities \u2014 would be vital to help drum up support for whoever is the nominee,\u201d Nethers said. \u201cWe saw it with Andrew Gillum, who made three or four stops here, and it ultimately helped him.\u201d\n\nDaniel Henry, Democratic committee chairman for Duval County in Northern Florida, said that in the early going, both state and national Democratic officials are taking a different tact and recognizing that there are votes to be won in areas like his \u2014 one that has historically favored Republicans but has become a voter-rich battleground for Democrats in recent cycles.\n\nFor example, state Democrats during the 2014 election only assigned two or three field organizers at a time to the county, which includes the city of Jacksonville and for decades had long trended Republican, Henry said.\n\nIn 2016, Clinton\u2019s campaign had only a small presence in the county before her campaign and Democrats built up presence months before Election Day. She ended up losing the county by about 1.4 percentage points.\n\nBut by the 2018 election cycle, the state party had assigned 15-to-18 field organizers at time assigned to the Jacksonville area. (Republicans won the gubernatorial race in the county by more than 12 percentage points in 2014, but Gillum took the county by more than four percentage points in 2018 race.)\n\n\u201cThe difference I see is there is a recognition (by state and national Democratic party leaders) that in order for them to get the vote margin they need, they must increase output in all urban areas,\u201d Henry said. \u201cJacksonville has a unique history of being a location in Florida that has a large African American voters. If you\u2019re going to win statewide in Florida, you have to get a large number of African American voters to actually show.\u201d\n\nWhoever wins the nomination will certainly need to make a marked improvement from Clinton\u2019s showing with black voters in 2016. At 59.6%, the 2016 black turnout was the lowest rate since 2000 and about six points behind that of the white turnout rate.\n\nHarris, the Dauphin County Democratic chairwoman, recalled raising concerns to a Pennsylvania state party leader about Democrats needing to do better job at embracing diversity \u2014 including candidates making certain that their campaign teams look like America. The leader, she recalled, responded, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have anywhere to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have that attitude,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take any vote for granted. People might not vote for Trump, but they can stay home.\u201d\n\nChelsea and Hillary Clinton pose with their new book \"The Book of Gutsy Women\" on October 03, 2019 in New York City. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images)\n\nDon't repeat Clinton's mistakes\n\nIn central Wisconsin, Garski, a longtime Democratic activist, made her first 2020 canvass more than nine months earlier than the last election cycle.\n\nClinton in her post-campaign memoir, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d acknowledged that \u201cif there\u2019s one place where we were caught by surprise, it was Wisconsin,\u201d saying that polls showed her ahead until the end. She skipped campaigning in Wisconsin and instead relied on surrogates to blanket the state.\n\nAs Garski knocked on doors in Stevens Point, she recalled the disappointment of 2016 and says the loss still gnaws at her. Portage County had been a reliably Democratic stronghold \u2014 Obama won it by about 28 points in 2008 and nearly 14 points in 2012. Clinton took the area by less than 4 points in 2016.\n\nFrom conversations she\u2019s had with friends and neighbors following the 2016 election, Garski says it is clear to her that Democrats\u2019 failure to reunite after a hard-fought primary battle between Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders played a big part in Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks at a rally Saturday, April 2, 2016, at UW-Eau Claire in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. (Photo: Ron Page/USA Today Network-Wisco)\n\nToo many Sanders voters, who thought the nomination process unfairly favored establishment candidates like Clinton, sat out the general election or even voted instead for Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein, she said. Sanders won the 2016 Democratic primary in Wisconsin.\n\nThe DNC has taken steps to underscore the importance of Wisconsin \u2014 which awards 10 delegates \u2014 by selecting Milwaukee to host the party\u2019s nominating convention.\n\nThe DNC also dialed back the importance of superdelegates, unpledged Democratic officials and party activist who choose for themselves whom they vote for at the convention. In 2020, superdelegates will be excluded unless no candidate wins a majority of the delegates on the first ballot at the national convention.\n\nGarski said she\u2019s trying to remain optimistic that Democrats will close ranks behind whoever the nominee is and won\u2019t see a repeat of 2016 in key states like hers.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful, but you just never know,\u201d Garski said.\n\nAfter several hours of canvassing on the recent afternoon in Stevens Point, Garski raced to catch the tail-end of the \u201cFighting\u201d Bob Fest, a gathering of progressive Democrats to honor the rabble-rousing grandfather of the state\u2019s progressive politics, Robert La Follette.\n\nShe arrived to catch the festival's closing session in which two of the state\u2019s more liberal lawmakers, state Sen. Jeff Smith and state Rep. Katrina Shankland, argued that Democratic candidates can win up and down the ballot by focusing on health care, education, wage growth and repairing the state and nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAll paths lead to Wisconsin and through Wisconsin, and Wisconsin, we have the opportunity to send our electoral votes to a strong progressive,\u201d Shankland told the gathering. \u201cThe path to a better White House, the path to a better Congress, to a better assembly runs across districts like this.\u201d\n\nBut as the festival wound down, one attendee told Shankland and Smith that she couldn\u2019t stomach casting a vote for the bulk of the Democratic field \u2014 most notably Biden \u2014 who she said haven\u2019t demonstrated that they \u201care good for my people.\u201d\n\n\u201cA $15 minimum wage is good for my people, getting Medicare for All is good for my people,\u201d said Lenore Hitchler, 71, a retired nanny and Sanders supporter who said she would support Sanders or Warren in 2020 but would not commit to the rest of the field. \u201cI want the Democratic party to know that even though I\u2019m a member of the party, they don\u2019t have my vote locked up.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/14/2020-election-how-do-democrats-beat-trump/3899108002/", "description": "More than two dozen Democratic party leaders in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin talking to USA TODAY about the keys to beating Trump in 2020.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Published A.M.
