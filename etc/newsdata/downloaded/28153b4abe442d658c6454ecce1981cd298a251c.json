They also ambushed General Flynn in the White House for an interview, and we know how that went down. It was James Comey who asked his deputy director Andy McCabe to send agents down there to go after General Flynn.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nSmith remarked, \u201cKeep in mind, this is a very, very large operation against General Flynn that started long before Donald Trump was elected, and this was the other terrific thing that Sydney Powell has done with her work.\u201d\n\n\u201cStefan Halper, who was identified by the Washington Post and the New York Times as the confidential human source who was sent to spy on the Trump campaign,\u201d noted Smith. \u201cNow, what Sydney Powell has found, is that he had a handler at the Pentagon. So we\u2019re talking about the Department of Justice, we\u2019re talking about the FBI, but we\u2019re also talking about the Pentagon. We are talking about a number of different agencies involved in targeting General Flynn.\u201d\n\nFBI agents are often able to claim their interview subjects \u201clie,\u201d noted Smith, given the FBI\u2019s convention to rely on notes from interviewing agents as opposed to actual recordings of interviews.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to people about this [perjury trap],\u201d shared Smith, \u201cformer FBI agents who have said [and] who have pointed out quite correctly that these people are experienced in doing interrogation. They can get basically anyone to catch themselves up and lie or make an error, say something wrong, and then, if the prosecutor wants to take someone down and hurt someone, they\u2019ll do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wanted to both knock [Michael Flynn] out of power, knock him out of the White House, and to bankrupt him, and these are things that they\u2019ve done to him,\u201d Smith said.\n\nFlynn sought to combat waste and fraud across intelligence agencies as President Donald Trump\u2019s national security advisor via audits, said Smith.\n\n\u201cWhen General Flynn was coming to the White House, [he] was talking about conducting an audit across the intelligence community,\u201d Smith explained. \u201cHe recognized the amount of waste [and] the amount of money that had been misspent. He knew what people were doing. He knew that people were hiding these things in different black programs, and he was going to look and start to inspect budgets.\u201d\n\nSmith continued, \u201cHe was going to get the entire senior intelligence service to hand in their resignations. Now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he was going to fire everyone. What it means, though, is he wanted everyone to prove what they were doing, that they were doing their jobs, they were doing good for the country, they weren\u2019t wasting money, they weren\u2019t wasting time, and they weren\u2019t running operations like the one they ran against General Flynn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community, at that point \u2014 what has correctly and colorfully became known as the deep state \u2014 they rose nearly as one and they realized that General Flynn was an existential threat,\u201d assessed Smith. \u201cHe was actually going to start looking at their budgets and start looking at what they did. They had to find a way to fight him.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "The deep state launched a criminal conspiracy to destroy Michael Flynn to prevent audits of intelligence agency operations, said Lee Smith.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/GettyImages-1074359516.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
