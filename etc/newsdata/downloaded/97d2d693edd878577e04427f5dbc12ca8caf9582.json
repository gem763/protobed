I don\u2019t feel that in this group.\n\n\u201cWe have a mindset of \u2018bring it on\u2019. We talk a lot about \u2018bring on the challenges\u2019. We embrace it and look forward to trying to take it as opposed to shying away from it.\n\n\u201cWe focus less on the fear factor, more on the opportunity. So while there are only four boys who have been in a World Cup quarter-final before, with our bring-it-on mentality we will embrace any nervousness and use it as positive energy to drive us on.\u201d\n\nMarler, 29, says he came out of international retirement to play in this tournament because he sensed England were on the cusp of something special.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cPart of the reason was that I want to be part of a squad that wins the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see the potential in this group and I wanted a taste of that.\u201d\n\nGetting himself back so quickly to the position where he is England\u2019s first-choice loosehead, albeit helped by injury to Mako Vunipola, has taken some effort.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI have worked my buns off to try and get back into an emotional and mental state capable of contributing to the squad the best I can.\n\n\u201cThe physical side has been even harder. You come out of it for a year and you forget how quick and fast they do everything.\u201d\n\nEngland name their team tomorrow and have the option of starting both Vunipolas together for the first time since February.\n\nNumber eight Billy, sidelined by an ankle injury since half-time in the win over Argentina, trained in Beppu yesterday and defence coach John Mitchell later said he was \u201cvery likely\u201d to play.", "description": "England face Australia for a place in the Rugby World Cup semi-final on Saturday morning", "authors": ["Alex Spink", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587766.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-Media-Access.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
