Adam Schiff, leader of the House Democratic effort to impeach President Trump, pressed former United States special representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker to testify that Ukrainian officials felt pressured to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter as a result of Trump withholding U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Volker denied that was the case, noting that Ukrainian leaders did not even know the aid was being withheld and that they believed their relationship with the U.S. was moving along satisfactorily, without them having done anything Trump mentioned in his notorious July 25 phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When Volker repeatedly declined to agree to Schiff\u2019s characterization of events, Schiff said, \u201cAmbassador, you\u2019re making this much more complicated than it has to be.\u201d\n\nWow, this is SO shameful. Schiff all but trying to lead Volker into testifying to something that was not true.\n\nWe wish we could say this is unreal BUT it\u2019s just not.\n\nSearching for \"facts\" he wants to hear, while not listening to the actual facts. \u2014 Becky (@ReformedLib928) October 17, 2019\n\nWhat is happening in this country, to our legitimately elected President, is frightening. I don\u2019t believe that Schiff and his cohorts will be successful, but the fact that they feel emboldened to try to upend the 2016 election is unnerving. \u2014 Susan F (@SMF904) October 17, 2019\n\nThey\u2019ve spent three years trying to destroy Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s all they\u2019ve done.\n\nAnd whether you like the guy or not, this gross abuse of power has been pretty damn terrifying.\n\nSchiff is awful \u2014 Michael Rice \ud83c\udf7b (@MikeRice74) October 17, 2019\n\nSounds more like witness intimidation than a deposition. \u2014 Merri Moon (@merri_116) October 17, 2019\n\nThe TRUTH always seems to complicate things for Democrats\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 Ranger Dave Kauffman (@DaveKauffman7) October 17, 2019\n\nAnd THAT\u2019S the truth.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve SEEN it\u2019: Mollie Hemingway uses CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto\u2019s tweet to embarrass media for their \u2018whistleblower\u2019 reporting\n\nSomeone needs a Snickers bar!
