He settled in Nottingham after extending his military service and married his wife, Nellie, with whom he had six children.\n\nBlack history matters to everyone \u2013 it\u2019s a crucial part of our nations\u2019 story | Lonnie Bunch Read more\n\nIrons worked at the Chilwell ordnance depot in the 1950s where he was one of the few black employees. He campaigned through the Nottingham and District Trades Council, as well as community and church groups for improved opportunities and against discrimination.\n\nA ban on black people working for a city transport company was overturned as a result of his efforts and Irons helped Nottingham city council address problems following race riots in 1958.\n\nFour years later, in 1962, he made history when he became Britain\u2019s first black magistrate or justice of the peace. His endeavours to advance equality and champion social justice were recognised when he was awarded an OBE in 1978.\n\nIrons continued to serve on the bench in Nottingham for 29 years until retiring in 1991. He died in 2007. In a joint statement, his sons said: \u201cThis plaque is a wonderful way to secure the legacy of our father, Eric Irons, as a man who devoted his whole life to serving people of all colours, religion, age and the whole community.\n\n\u201c[Our] father received a number of honours throughout his life, including the OBE, Jamaican badge of honour, an honorary degree from Nottingham University, and first black justice of the peace in Britain. This plaque would have given him equal pleasure.\u201d\n\nBev Baker, senior curator at the National Justice Museum, said: \u201cWe are incredibly honoured to be marking and celebrating the contribution that Eric Irons made to the justice system in Nottingham and his dedication as a campaigner for social justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also fitting that this celebration is taking place on the first day of Black History Month, as it is vitally important to champion diversity in our city and diversity within our justice system.\u201d", "description": "Memorial commemorating Britain\u2019s first black magistrate marks start of Black History Month", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3855efd5ad70b800159dd91a892a341c04ab15c/0_37_864_518/master/864.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b3333231b163cd7cadbafc232dd4d66", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
