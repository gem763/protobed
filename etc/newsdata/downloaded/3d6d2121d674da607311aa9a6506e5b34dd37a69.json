Koch Theater, the company honored his milestone with showers of confetti, garlands of flowers and a special ballet choreographed by Tharp, \u201cA Gathering of Ghosts.\u201d\n\nThe evening began with Cornejo, all in white, performing the title role in George Balanchine\u2019s \u201cApollo,\u201d debuting in the classic role at the seasoned age of 38. It proved a perfect match for his dramatic sensibilities and his physical gifts of a feather-light jump and superb control. Dancing opposite him as Terpsichore was ballerina Misty Copeland, a longtime and frequent partner.\n\nNext came a short film in which Cornejo, as narrator, introduced himself. \u201cDance has given me a beautiful way of living,\u201d he said, noting how he first became enamored with ballet as an 8-year-old boy in Buenos Aires, when he saw a production of \u201cSpartacus.\u201d He spoke of the influence of his sister, Erica Cornejo, a former ABT dancer who recently retired from Boston Ballet.\n\nThen Erica Cornejo herself came onstage for \u201cEl Chamuyo,\u201d a tango-inspired duet with her brother, a brief but crowd-pleasing piece to music by Francisco Canaro and choreography by Ana Maria Steckelman.\n\nThe evening ended with Tharp\u2019s new work, a whimsical piece in which Cornejo, in a matador-like jumpsuit in black and shiny silver, played \u201chost\u201d to ghosts including Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette, Proust and a character called \u201cGreased Lightning.\u201d\n\nThen came the curtain calls, the ovations, the confetti descending from the rafters, and Tharp, extremely limber at 78, leaping into Cornejo\u2019s arms and wrapping her legs around him.\n\nCornejo joined ABT in 1999 and swiftly moved through the ranks, becoming a soloist in 2000 and a principal in 2003. Though he captured the hearts of audiences with his superb technique, his relatively short height - he is 5-foot-6 - prevented him at first from getting the romantic leads in traditional story ballets.\n\nBut that gradually changed, and he now dances roles like Romeo, Siegfried in \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d and the prince in \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty,\u201d among many others.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "On a night full of balletic leaps, the most joyous came during curtain calls, when iconic American choreographer Twyla Tharp bounded into the arms of dancer Herman Cornejo to celebrate his 20th anniversary on the New York stage.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jocelyn Noveck"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/27/dance_abt_cornejo_82824_c0-175-3000-1925_s1200x700.jpg?07581b4ef7e131d37e0fa0ea1b5a286d8f3ae4dd", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
