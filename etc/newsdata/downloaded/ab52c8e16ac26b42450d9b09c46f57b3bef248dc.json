(Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters)\n\nThe greatest risk in giving our government any power to control our speech is that it would then have a vehicle to prohibit speech that was critical of it.\n\nA piece published late last week in the New York Times argues that our free-speech rights are literally endangering us \u2014 but the truth is, they keep us safe.\n\nIn a piece titled \u201cFree Speech Is Killing Us,\u201d Andrew Marantz argues that \u201cnoxious speech is causing tangible harm,\u201d using tragedies such as Heather Heyer\u2019s murder in Charlottesville, the massacre at the Walmart in El Paso, and the shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, as evidence of this. Marantz then declares that, in order to stay safe, we have no choice but to start treating the First Amendment the way that our government currently treats the Second \u2014 by watering it down with regulations rather than treating it as an absolute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, throughout the piece, Marantz states that, although he may have aligned with the views of free-speech absolutists in the past, he now disagrees, considering the \u201cfree speech\u201d argument to be \u201cintellectually dishonest\u201d and \u201cmorally bankrupt.\u201d\n\nGuess what? I also used to be a free-speech absolutist. Guess what else? I still am. Completely, totally, and without exception. Does that make me, as Marantz suggests, \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d?\n\nNope. See, believe it or not, I actually support complete free speech not because I don\u2019t care about the welfare of the American people. I support it because I do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee, Marantz repeatedly reminded the reader that what he had an issue with was \u201chate speech\u201d specifically. In fact, he even summarized a comment from University of California law professor John A. Powell, which was that someday the \u201cblanket protections of hate speech\u201d seen in our current laws will eventually be viewed as \u201cridiculous in retrospect.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: As concerned as Marantz may be about \u201chate speech,\u201d at no place in his entire piece did he even attempt to define what it actually is.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t do so. In fact, I think I can guess: The phrase can be difficult, if not impossible, to define \u2014 because it so often means quite different things to different people.\n\nIt\u2019s true: What one person might consider \u201chate speech,\u201d another might consider to be harmless, or even funny. In recent years, I have noticed that there are many people, particularly in liberal circles and on college campuses, who have a very different view of what is and is not acceptable speech than I, or I\u2019d argue even most, do. In the years I\u2019ve spent covering political correctness for National Review, I have been straight-up floored by some of the speech people have claimed to be \u201coffensive\u201d or otherwise unacceptable. I am not kidding: The phrase \u201clong time no see,\u201d the conjunction \u201cbut,\u201d and the word \u201ccyclist\u201d are among the many examples of things that some have declared problematic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me be clear: It\u2019s not that I like hate speech. No \u2014 I absolutely detest what I consider to be \u201chate speech,\u201d but with that qualifier comes the problem: It is totally subjective. Do we really want to give the government the power to define the undefinable, and risk living in a time where telling someone \u201cLong time no see!\u201d could result in criminal prosecution?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe worst part about it, though, is that that risk isn\u2019t even the most serious one. The greatest risk in giving our government any power to control our speech is that it would then have a vehicle to prohibit speech that was critical of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee, one of the greatest things about living in the United States is that we have the absolute freedom to say whatever we want about our government, while being protected against government retaliation. This is very important \u2014 not only for the emotional relief that can come with free expression, but also as a legitimate, impactful check on government corruption. In other countries, it\u2019s not like that. In other countries, you can be killed for the exact same kinds of things that you\u2019re completely allowed to say here.\n\nI\u2019m not, of course, suggesting that implementing Marantz\u2019s ideas would result in our government murdering us over speech. What I am saying, though, is that it would unquestionably open the door for it to be able to take away a very sacred freedom: The freedom to speak out against public injustices. In an environment like that, without that check on government power, it would be far easier for injustice to prevail. That is what would present a real danger to us \u2014 one far greater than that of any speech itself.\n\nBut what about that huge violence problem that Marantz describes free speech as causing, you might ask? What about how we are all going to be massacred and killed, Timpf? Well, a look at the actual facts might suggest that his correlation between speech and violent death may be more rooted in hysteria and a media-perpetuated narrative than in truth. In fact, as Reason\u2019s Robby Soave notes:\n\nToday the U.S. has greater protections for free speech and less violence. The Supreme Court has recognized increasingly fewer exceptions to the First Amendment over the last several decades. The result has not been an increase in violence: The violent crime rate has plummeted since the early 1990s.\n\nIt is, of course, true that speech has motivated some awful people to do some awful things \u2014 recently, particularly in the form of white nationalism. The truth is, though, we already have a way to fight speech that we don\u2019t like in this country: Countering it with our own.", "description": "Give government power to control our speech and it would have a vehicle to prohibit speech that was critical of it.", "authors": ["Katherine Timpf", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "A.
