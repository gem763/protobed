Full-back Kearney missed Ireland\u2019s 47-5 thrashing over Samoa having failed to train fully in the week leading up to that seven-try win in Fukuoka.\n\nLeinster\u2019s Larmour impressed against the Samoans as Ireland sealed the bonus-point win required to book their place in the last eight. But now head coach Joe Schmidt has restored 94-cap Kearney to what amounts to Ireland\u2019s strongest starting XV, barring the suspended Bundee Aki.\n\nSchmidt admitted it was a tight call to select Kearney ahead of Larmour. \u201cYeah, there were probably half a dozen reasonably tight selection decisions,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cAnd you weigh up the experiences, previous performances against other opposition. You can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ve got any decision right until the game is completed.\u201d\n\nGarry Ringrose returns at outside centre with Robbie Henshaw stepping inside to No 12 to offset the absence of Aki, who was sent off against Samoa. Peter O\u2019Mahony slots in ahead of Tadhg Beirne at blindside flanker, with Rory Best captaining the side in an unchanged tight five.\n\nFor New Zealand, the scrum-half Aaron Smith and the centre Jack Goodhue are the only starting backs who survive from Dublin while Beauden Barrett, who started at full-back that evening before switching to full-back when Richie Mo\u2019unga came off the bench in the second-half, will wear the 15 jersey.\n\n\u201cWe were in the good position of having all 31 players to consider,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cIt was a case of having more players good enough to start than leave out. The likes of Ryan Crotty and Ben Smith are not in the 23, but that does not mean it will be the case in the next game, if we get to that stage.\n\n\u201cI am really comfortable with the group we have gone with. I am not thinking that it may be my last match with the All Blacks. That is not important and it is something to reflect on only when our tournament is over. All I am focused on is an important international against a good side.\u201d\n\nHansen has picked Brodie Retallick even though the second row has only had 30 minutes of rugby this tournament. \u201cHe will go for as long as we want him to,\u201d said the coach. \u201cHe has a big motor and there are no question marks about his fitness. And we have Scott Barrett on the bench, a very good player.\u201d\n\nIreland have never won a World Cup quarter-final while New Zealand\u2019s last defeat in the tournament was at this stage 12 years ago when they were beaten by the then-hosts France in Cardiff.\n\n\u201cIreland are probably feeling it is their turn to win one,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cThat does not guarantee they will. I bumped into Andy Farrell [Ireland\u2019s defence coach] on Wednesday and we talked about the fact that one of us will be going home after the match.\n\n\u201cIt is the cold reality at this stage of a World Cup. Ireland know what it is like to go home at this stage, as I do, and they will be doing their darnedest to ensure it does not happen again. So will we. I just hope that it is an exciting game of rugby that is not affected by cards and that at the end of it no one has any excuses, taking defeat on the chin.\u201d\n\nThe match will be refereed by Welshman Nigel Owens, the most experienced official in the tournament. \u201cWe will have to watch out for his sense of humour because he is pretty good with one-liners,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cHe has his idiosyncrasies, but we know him, as do Ireland. What I like about him is that over the years he has shown himself to be good under pressure. I would not want anyone else.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand were stifled by Ireland\u2019s rush defence in Dublin, but they have picked a team to run here with George Bridge and Sevu Reece on the wings, Goodhue and Anton Leinert-Brown in the midfield, prompted by the attacking axis of Mo\u2019unga and Barrett.\n\n\u201cWe may not be the most experienced backline, but I would not say we are raw when you look at what we have achieved in Super Rugby,\u201d said Bridge. \u201cWe have come through some pretty big games together and we just want to go out there and perform. We know Ireland like to kick a lot but we are confident of winning the aerial battle.\u201d\n\nLike Hansen, it could be Read\u2019s final match for the All Blacks as he is moving to Japan at the end of the tournament. \u201cThat\u2019s not on my mind,\u201d Read said. \u201cI am just really excited to be playing in a World Cup knock-out again. We have a lot of respect for Ireland and we have to make sure we have learned the lessons from our two defeats to them in the last few years.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand: 15-Beauden Barrett, 14-Sevu Reece, 13-Jack Goodhue, 12-Anton Lienert-Brown, 11-George Bridge, 10-Richie Mo\u2019unga, 9-Aaron Smith, 8-Kieran Read (captain), 7-Sam Cane, 6-Ardie Savea, 5-Sam Whitelock, 4-Brodie Retallick, 3-Nepo Laulala, 2-Codie Taylor, 1-Joe Moody.
