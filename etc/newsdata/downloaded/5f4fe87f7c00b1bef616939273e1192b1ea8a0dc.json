This represents a profoundly corrupt misuse of the machinery of government for personal gain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to stress, however, that even without these surrounding circumstances (or even if some of them depend upon contested facts), what\u2019s within the four corners of the White House account of the July 25 call, standing alone, reflects a gross abuse of office.\n\nIt also easily satisfies the constitutional standards for impeachment. Recent debates about whether Trump violated federal election law are misplaced and trivialize what\u2019s really at stake here. The president\u2019s derelictions are far more profound and more fundamental to the constitutional order than a mere violation of the criminal code. To use scholar Charles Black\u2019s canonical test for whether impeachment is warranted, Trump engaged in (1) extremely serious conduct that (2) corrupts or subverts the political and governmental process and \u201ctend[s] seriously to undermine and corrupt the political order\u201d and (3) is \u201cplainly wrong in [itself] to a person of honor, or to a good citizen, regardless of words on the statute books.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Black\u2019s hypothetical case illuminating the operation of this test was eerily prescient: \u201cSuppose,\u201d he wrote, that \u201ca president were shown by convincing evidence to have used the federal tax system consistently and massively as a means of harassing and punishing his political opponents. As far as I know, this conduct is not criminal in the ordinary sense. But does such gross misuse of what is supposed to be a politically neutral arm of government not tend seriously to undermine and corrupt the political order? Is it not obviously wrong, to any man of ordinary honor? If these questions are answered \u2018yes,\u2019 then this offense, as lawyers might say, is eiusdem generis, of the same kind, with treason and bribery\u2026. If it is not a crime under statute, then it is the kind of offense which ought to be held impeachable, though not criminal in the ordinary sense.\u201d\n\nAnd yet there\u2019s another important feature of Donald Trump\u2019s conduct with respect to the July 25 phone call, one that hasn\u2019t received nearly the attention it deserves, that provides even more compelling proof of his unfitness to serve as chief executive\u2014namely, what Trump thinks and says about that phone call today.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t deny that he urged Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Yet he\u2019s not the least bit contrite about it. He doesn\u2019t admit that he erred in an unguarded moment, and he certainly will never pledge to refrain from ever using his diplomatic authorities to advance his own electoral prospects. To the contrary: Trump insists that his conversation was \u201cpitch perfect.\u201d Just as he believes an attorney general\u2019s job is to protect the President, regardless of any ethics constraints or norms of prosecutorial independence from the White House, it appears Trump sincerely believes there\u2019s nothing wrong with using the levers of presidential diplomacy, and control of military aid, to induce foreign officials to dig up dirt on his political opponents. (The Washington Post reports that \u201ceven privately, Trump did not believe his conversation with the Ukrainian president was problematic, according to four people with whom he spoke.\u201d).", "description": "Even if they won\u2019t vote to impeach or convict the president, members of Congress should still condemn it\u2014before his misdeeds become standard operating procedure.", "authors": ["Marty Lederman", "Benjamin Wittes", "Professor At The Georgetown University Law Center", "Contributing Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX6JSKI/facebook.jpg?1569886068", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
