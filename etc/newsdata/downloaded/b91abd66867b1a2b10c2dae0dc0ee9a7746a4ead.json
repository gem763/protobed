REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google expects to triple its customer workforce to support cloud computing services in Latin America by the end of next year, Google Cloud\u2019s director in Brazil, Jo\u00e3o Bolonha, said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis growth has already started and we\u2019ve been expanding teams in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Colombia,\u201d he told journalists at the Google Cloud Summit in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nAccording to the U.S. tech giant, its total capital expenditures globally hit $47 billion (37.8 billion pounds) over the past three years and the plan is to keep investing.\n\n\u201cInside Latin America, Brazil is our largest market (in cloud computing) and the one with the fastest growth,\u201d Bolonha said, adding that customer consumption of cloud computing solutions rose over 300% in 2018.\n\nHe gave no details on the current size of Google\u2019s Latin American workforce, or on the number of cloud computing services jobs it planned to add.\n\nBut Bolonha said less than 20% of the companies in Brazil are currently using cloud computing services in their operations, meaning there is still a lot of room to grow despite increasing competition from other players such as Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit of U.S. e-commerce group Amazon.com (AMZN.O).\n\n\u201cCompetition is fiercer in some specific industries such as retail, but there is still 80 percent of the market to be explored,\u201d Bolonha said.\n\n(The story corrects paragraph 3 as Google says capex information it erroneously provided was global total, not just for cloud computing services.)", "description": "Alphabet Inc's Google expects to triple its customer workforce to support cloud computing services in Latin America by the end of next year, Google Cloud's director in Brazil, Jo\u00e3o Bolonha, said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439448196&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991T7", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
