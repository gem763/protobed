And Elahe Izadi examines the rarefied place in pop culture that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d Kenan Thompson occupies.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\n\u2018A very political process\u2019: Covering the Nixon, Clinton and Trump impeachment inquiries\n\nChief political correspondent Dan Balz has covered politics since the 1960s. That means he\u2019s tracked two impeachment inquiries in his tenure \u2014 into presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the country heads into its third impeachment inquiry in half a century, Balz says there\u2019s a long road ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s a multi-step process and we\u2019re only at the front-end of it,\u201d Balz says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Kenan Thompson went from child star to indispensable steady hand\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d Kenan Thompson is hyper-aware of camera positions, timing and the ripple effect his actions have on people trying to do their jobs on set. That serious professionalism, his colleagues tell pop culture writer Elahe Izadi , is the other side to what television audiences see at home \u2014 the breeziness of a natural performer who can summon humor everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a talent that puts him everywhere: as the straight man, the bad guy, the steady anchor in an iffy sketch centered on a newbie. \u201cIf you go back and watch some sketches where he\u2019s not supposed to be the one delivering the laughs,\u201d Izadi says, \u201ceven in the straight character he\u2019s playing, he\u2019s able to amp everything up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s a commitment that\u2019s helped him become the longest-tenured cast member on a famously challenging show to endure, where comedy icons are molded and tend to leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI would always represent hard work and dedication and professionalism, and just focus on the fact that the world needs a laugh,\u201d says Thompson, who is entering his 17th season of SNL.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Chief political correspondent Dan Balz on covering two presidential impeachment inquiries.
