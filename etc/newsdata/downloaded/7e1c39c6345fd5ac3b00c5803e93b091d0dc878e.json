More than 100,000 people are expected to attend the game on Saturday, with officials preparing to see the iconic footy field awash with black, yellow, and orange of Richmond and GWS supporters. Australian music legend Paul Kelly will headline the Grand Final with Tones and I and Dean Lewis also set to perform. Image: Getty\n\nIt is officially the year of breakout pop artist Tones and I, with her smash hit Dance Monkey topping the 2019 ARIA Awards leader board with eight nominations.\n\nIn just over a year, the infectiously unique 19-year-old artist has gone from quitting her retail job to busk in Byron Bay to holding No.1 on the ARIA singles chart for a historic 10 weeks and also claim No.1 in the UK last week.\n\nHer rags to riches story, from living in her van while building audiences of hundreds busking on the streets of Byron to performing in front of 100,000 at the AFL Grand Final, is both a tale of doing it old school and finding a global audience in the streaming era.\n\nShe has more than 300 million streams, has hit No.1 in seven other countries around the world and topped the Global Shazam charts, signalling there are still more fans discovering her music each week.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Dance Monkey earworming its way into the pop Zeitgeist, with Never Seen The Rain and her debut singleJohnny Run Away also bouncing around the top 50.\n\nWhile Tones represents the future of Australian pop, soul blues band Teskey Brothers prove there is still a heartland for rock here, winning seven nominations for their second album Run Home Slow.\n\nEqual with seven nominations are hip hop heroes Hilltop Hoods, currently on tour in Europe, whose Great Expanse album and tour cemented their place as the country\u2019s biggest band this year. Both are up for the coveted Album of the Year award.\n\nMore breakthrough female artists were recognised for their contributions to the Australian soundtrack in 2019, with the sweet-singing, tough-talking Thelma Plum and Julia Jacklin each receiving six nominations.\n\nIf you needed evidence that Paul Kelly is the GOAT, a truly remarkable musical superstar who can do anything, he has made ARIA history this year with three different records nominated across three different genres in his clutch of five nominations.\n\nThirteen Ways To Look At Birds, his classical collaboration with James Ledger, won Best Classical Album at the nominations event in Sydney on Thursday where the artisan and fine arts trophies are given out ahead of the televised awards on November 27.\n\nMORE NEWS\n\nMiley and Cody\u2019s bizarre PDA\n\nUber\u2019s new reward for best behaved riders revealed\n\nIkea fridge among year\u2019s worst products\n\nHis Nature record is up for the Best Adult Contemporary gong while his Live At The Opera Housealbum has been nominated in the Best Blues and Roots category.\n\nLast year\u2019s ARIA awards stars Amy Shark and Dean Lewis are carry-over champions in 2019, each receiving four nominations including Song of the Year.\n\nAnd Guy Sebastian, host of the 2019 ARIA Awards, and the artist most likely robbed of a No.1 for his brilliant song Choir, has received four nominations, including Best Pop Release.\n\nAfter several years of frustration among the hip hop and r&b communities about being lumped into the Best Urban Release, they each got their own categories this year with Best Hip Hop and Best Soul/R&B Release.\n\nThe 2019 ARIA Awards will be held at the Star in Sydney on November 27.\n\nAlbum Of The Year\n\nDean Lewis - A Place We Knew\n\nHilltop Hoods - The Great Expanse\n\nR\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL - Solace\n\nThe Teskey Brothers - Run Home Slow\n\nThelma Plum - Better In Blak\n\nBest Male Artist\n\nDean Lewis - A Place We Knew\n\nGuy Sebastian - Choir\n\nHayden James - Between Us\n\nMatt Corby - Rainbow Valley\n\nPaul Kelly - Nature\n\nBest Female Artist\n\nAmy Shark - Mess Her Up\n\nJessica Mauboy - Little Things\n\nJulia Jacklin - Crushing\n\nThelma Plum - Better In Blak\n\nTones And I - Dance Monkey\n\nBest Dance Release\n\nDom Dolla - Take It\n\nFISHER - You Little Beauty\n\nPeking Duk & Jack River - Sugar\n\nPNAU - Solid Gold\n\nR\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL - Solace\n\nBest Group\n\n5 Seconds Of Summer - Easier\n\nBirds Of Tokyo - Good Lord\n\nHilltop Hoods - The Great Expanse\n\nR\u00dcF\u00dcS DU SOL - Solace\n\nThe Teskey Brothers - Run Home Slow\n\nBreakthrough Artist\n\nG Flip - About Us\n\nStella Donnelly - Beware Of The Dogs\n\nThe Teskey Brothers - Run Home Slow\n\nThelma Plum - Better In Blak\n\nTones And I - Dance Monkey\n\nBest Pop Release\n\nAmy Shark - Mess Her Up\n\nDean Lewis - A Place We Knew\n\nGuy Sebastian - Choir\n\nThelma Plum - Better In Blak\n\nTones And I - Dance Monkey\n\nBest Hip Hop Release\n\nBaker Boy - Cool As Hell\n\nHilltop Hoods - The Great Expanse\n\nIlly - Then What\n\nSampa The Great - Final Form\n\nTkay Maidza - Awake feat.
