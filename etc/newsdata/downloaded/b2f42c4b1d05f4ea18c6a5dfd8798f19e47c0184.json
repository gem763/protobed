He\u2019s played the youngsters and I\u2019m pleased to see them in there, with Saka.\n\n\u2018But Saka, for an 18-year-old, if you\u2019re leaving Ozil totally out of the squad, then we have to see more from him [Saka], we have to see more from Joe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, it was a game where it passed them both by and then it comes down to the manager and his choices.\u2019\n\nOdds on which Premier League managers could get sacked According to Betfair Exchange, the odds on the next EPL manager to leave are: Marco Silva \u2013 12/5 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer \u2013 12/5 Mauricio Pochettino \u2013 16/5 Ralph Hasenhuttl \u2013 6/1 Unai Emery \u2013 8/1 Steve Bruce \u2013 11/1 Quique Sanchez Flores \u2013 14/1 Dean Smith \u2013 14/1\n\nAfter the match, the odds that the Gunners\u2019 head coach Unai Emery will end up getting the sack were slashed from 23/1 to 8/1.\n\nOn the subject of his team\u2019s loss, Emery said: \u2018Yes, we\u2019re very disappointed with that result.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018There is the result, and secondly is how we managed the 90 minutes in the match. Really I think we created more chances than them, the better chances, but tonight we didn\u2019t achieve the efficiency to win that match.\n\n\u2018We conceded more corners to them than we wanted, and from one they scored. Also, when they are pushing and they are taking a lot of corners, they can do that.\n\n\u2018We created more corners, 12 [compared to] seven or eight for them, and also we had the chances and had a very clear penalty to Sokratis.\n\n\u2018In the second half it was not easy to get chances, I think we controlled the ball more with possession because they conceded metres on the pitch and we had chances to score, but we didn\u2019t achieve that goal to draw and the try to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think we deserved more, I don\u2019t think we deserved to lose that match but also I appreciate their work and they are here with their supporters and with that result, they felt strong to achieve that result. But we worked, but I can say for our players their attitude was good, they tried and I think we deserved more.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAfter, Arsenal\u2019s defeat, former Manchester United captain Patrice Evra slammed the Gunners, calling them \u2018my babies\u2019.\n\nEvra told Sky Sports: \u2018Sheffield United deserved the win, but I\u2019m not surprised about Arsenal. I said before the game that they had to make sure they didn\u2019t fall into the trap.\n\n\u2018I used to call them \u2018my babies\u2019 10 years ago, and they are still when I look at them and think they are \u2018my babies\u2019 and that\u2019s the truth \u2013 I\u2019m not being disrespectful when I say that.\n\n\u2018They look pretty, but they don\u2019t look like a winning team. They like playing good football, but I was so happy to play against them, because I knew I was going to win.\n\nPatrice Evra was not overly impressed by Arsenal\u2019s display against Sheffield United (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Even when Robin van Persie came, and on the first day I shook his hand, and I said \u201cwelcome to a man club\u201d. At the beginning he was upset, but after one month he said \u2018you were completely right Patrice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Guuendouzi was paying in midfield, but before he was playing in the French second league and he was not even playing regularly \u2013 and he\u2019s the best player in this team.\n\n\u2018I respect Aubameyang and Lacazette, but if those two guys don\u2019t score, they\u2019re in trouble.\u2019\n\nWhen asked about Evra\u2019s comments, Granit Xhaka replied: \u2018A lot of people speak too much.\n\n\u2018I have a lot of respect for him because he was a great player, but you have to be careful what you say.\n\n\u2018He knows what these situations well, but it\u2019s not only him. A lot of people speak a lot of bulls*** and it\u2019s always the same.\u2019\n\nMORE: Sheffield United 1-0 Arsenal: Lys Mousset strikes from close-range to down Gunners", "description": "After THAT Arsenal game against Sheffield United, here are the latest odds on managers who could be getting the sack in the future.", "authors": ["Aidan Milan"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182549279_1571747396.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
