But really his preparation for the draft began more than three months ago, when he was unveiled as Manchester Originals head coach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of planning around strategy and looking at options around different price bands tracking form and looking at all the data,\u201d says Katich, who has been a coach since retiring five years ago from a playing career that included 56 Tests for Australia.\n\nIn July, he visited Manchester to begin draft planning, and has been thinking about how to build his squad ever since. \u201cBetween myself and all our support staff and analyst there\u2019s been a fair bit of effort put in to try and get what we think will work on draft night.\u201d\n\nAnd yet there is an essential uncertainty to this process: for all the meticulous preparation, the night itself will still throw up unexpected challenges and opportunities. \u201cYou can have the best-laid plans but ultimately it can become a bit of a lottery on draft night because you can\u2019t predict who wants who.\u201d\n\nFrom experiences in the Caribbean Premier League draft and the Indian Premier League auction \u2013 he was involved in the Knight Riders stable of franchises and is now Royal Challengers Bangalore head coach \u2013 Katich has learnt of the need to be flexible when the clock is ticking. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have backup plans,\u201d he says. When a rival snares a player his team are seeking just before his turn to pick, \u201cyou might flip it to grab a different type of player\u201d \u2013 getting a bowler, say, when the plan had been to recruit a batsman next pick.", "description": "Simon Katich touched down in London on Thursday, three days before the inaugural Hundred draft.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000202709511-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
