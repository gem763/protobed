The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine announced that Ukraine requested the weapons on July 7.\n\nThe transaction, which was first reported by Bloomberg, follows the sale of 210 missiles and 37 launchers in March 2018 for $47 million.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said that the department won't \"comment on or confirm potential defense sales and transfers until they have been formally notified to Congress.\" Congress has 30 days to object once it receives official notification.\n\nThe Javelins have played a central role in the steady U.S. effort to provide military support and training to the Ukrainians since the Russian invasion of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nIn addition to the weapons sales, the United States has provided $1.5 billion in military assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and June 2019, according to an updated analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ce/34/92e974a44d5a9029a616931bb791/190826-state-department-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
