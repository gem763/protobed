One attractive feature is that it uses existing simple technology developed for storing and compressing liquefied natural gas (LNG), so unlike battery storage it does not require mining for rare minerals.\n\nThe key innovation is to store the excess heat given out when the air is compressed and use it to re-heat the liquified air when it is needed.\n\nThe idea was promoted by self-taught engineer Peter Dearman from his garage in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire.\n\nHe had been developing a car run on similar principles with liquid hydrogen and saw the potential for applying the technology to electricity storage.\n\nHe is now a passive shareholder in Highview, which is hoping to play in the big league of storage.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"It\u2019s great news - very exciting. There\u2019s such a lot of potential in these technologies.\"\n\n'Carbon free future'\n\nThe proposed grid-scale project will supply electricity to around 25,000 homes for a day, although realistically it will only be used for short periods to cover sudden peaks in demand.\n\nThe firm's boss, Javier Cavada, said the plant will be built on the site of a former disused power plant.\n\nHe said: \"This plant will provide the critical services needed to help maintain a stable and reliable grid. Giga-scale energy storage will be key to a 100% carbon-free future.\"\n\nProfessor John Loughhead, Chief Scientific Adviser at the government\u2019s business and energy department, has previously praised the technology.\n\nThe Electricity System Operator, which manages supply and demand in Britain, said they expected the Highview plant to bid for contracts in the market for flexible electricity.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin", "description": "The UK will build the first ever liquid air energy storage plant, based on an idea from a backyard inventor.", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1059C/production/_109327966_highviewpower-50mw-250mwh-cryobattery-002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
