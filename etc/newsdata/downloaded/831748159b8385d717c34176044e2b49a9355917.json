The proposal, while limited to remote areas in South America and to married men already ordained as deacons in the church, is seen by many as setting a precedent that could bring an end to the restriction on married Catholic priests throughout the world.\n\nThe proposals were contained in a final document approved yesterday at the end of a three-week synod on the Amazon held at the Vatican. The synod was called by Pope Francis in 2017 to focus attention on saving the rainforest and better ministering to its indigenous peoples.\n\nThe document approved by the bishops noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have \u201cenormous difficulties\u201d in receiving communion and seeing a priest. It proposed to \u201cordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community\u201d, who had already had \u201cfruitful\u201d experiences as deacons and who \u201creceive an adequate formation for the priesthood, having a legitimately constituted and stable family\u201d.\n\nThe celibate priesthood has been a tradition since the 11th century, imposed in part for financial reasons to ensure priests\u2019 assets pass to the church and not to their heirs. Married priests are permitted in some eastern Catholic churches as well as where married Anglican priests have converted.\n\nReformers say the change is crucial to meet the needs of the pan-Amazonian region but acknowledge it could lead to similar reforms elsewhere. Shortages of priests are so bad that some Amazon communities go months without a proper mass.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, the pope said he would reopen the work of a 2016 commission that studied the issue of women deacons. He promised that the Vatican would continue to study the role of women in the early years of the church. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t grasped the significance of women in the church. Their role must go well beyond questions of function,\u201d he said.\n\nSome conservatives and traditionalists warn that any papal opening to married priests or women deacons would lead the church to ruin. They accused the synod organisers, and even the pope himself, of heresy for even considering flexibility on mandatory priestly celibacy.\n\nThe celibacy idea was supported 128-41 by the bishops. The report noted that some participants wanted a more \u201cuniversal approach\u201d, suggesting support for married priests elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe pope, who is from Argentina, has long said he appreciates the discipline and the gift of celibacy, but that it can change, given that it is not doctrine.\n\nBishops in the Amazon say Protestant and evangelical churches are wooing away Catholic souls in the absence of vibrant communities where the Eucharist can be regularly celebrated.", "description": "They also urged the Vatican to re\u00adopen the debate on ordaining women as deacons", "authors": ["David Connett"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075798ecf33debb75697a0a9271cc617d8255e18/0_295_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3176c9795d751c9e51362de37293853f", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
