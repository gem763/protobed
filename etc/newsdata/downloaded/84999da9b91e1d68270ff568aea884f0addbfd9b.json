REUTERS/Akintunde Akinleye\n\nThe country, Africa\u2019s top oil producer and the continent\u2019s largest economy, is faced with the choice of boosting growth in the face of lower oil revenues or fixing its dilapidated road and rail networks, while paying off debts and funding the higher minimum wage.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday presented a record 10.33 trillion-naira ($33.8 billion) budget for 2020 to lawmakers as he aimed to spur growth at the start of his second term in office.\n\nThe spending plan includes a value-added tax increase from 5% to 7.5% and a minimum monthly wage increase to 30,000 naira ($98) from 18,000 to implement a change that was signed into law in April.\n\n\u201cInflation will likely pick up in 2020 following rising minimum wages and a higher VAT rate, despite a tight monetary policy,\u201d the IMF said in a statement late on Tuesday. \u201cThe outlook under current policies remains challenging.\u201d\n\nInflation, which has fallen steadily since May, dropped to a 3-1/2 year low in August on lower food prices, increasing the chances of an interest rate cut. However, the central bank has kept rates tight to support the naira.\n\nThe price index peaked at 18.7 percent in January last year, and has been in double digits for three years, outside a central bank\u2019s target of 6-9%. The bank has said it would maintain its tight stance in 2019, and sees inflation at 11.31 percent, rising to 12 percent this year before moderating.\n\nThe budget unveiled on Tuesday tops the previous record spending plan, which was the 9.12 trillion-naira budget for 2018.\n\nBuhari\u2019s government has repeatedly rolled out record spending plans but struggled to fund them due to lower oil output and an inability to boost non-oil exports. This has kept the government dependent on expensive borrowing, the IMF said.\n\n\u201cOver-optimistic revenue projections have led to higher financing needs than initially envisaged, resulting in over-reliance on the expensive borrowing from the central bank to finance the deficit,\u201d the Fund said.\n\nThe IMF said Nigeria\u2019s economy was recovering, albeit slowly after a 2016 recession, with its dollar buffers declining due to rising capital flight. It said bigger deficits make monetary policy complex owing to the government\u2019s reliance on central bank for funding.\n\nEconomic growth slowed to 1.94% in the three months to the end of June, the second quarter in a row to see deceleration. The Fund said growth could pick up this year to 2.3% on the back of a good harvest and as the oil sector recovery continues.\n\n($1 = 306.0000 naira)", "description": "Nigeria's government may drive up inflation when it increases a sales tax to partly finance its record 2020 budget and implements a new minimum wage, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned.", "authors": ["Paul Carsten", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438884685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981H8-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
