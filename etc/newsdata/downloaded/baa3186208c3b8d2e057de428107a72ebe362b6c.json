Whatever happens this weekend, is set to determine the party\u2019s direction and hopefully provide clarity on its policies.\n\nDA national spokesperson Solly Malatsi reiterated Maimane\u2019s call for the policy conference and confirmed that Maimane requested an early conference despite the possibilities of the conference being swayed towards removing him as a leader.\n\nMalatsi said this at a media briefing update, on Saturday, at the party\u2019s headquarters in Johannesburg.\n\nThe gathering was expected to discuss a report of the organisational review panel, which was commissioned to look into the party\u2019s dismal performance in this year\u2019s elections. It\u2019s understood the report recommends, among other things, that Maimane and now former DA CEO Paul Boughey should step down.\n\nThis weekend will help unsettle all the curiosity on everyone\u2019s mind about what is happening in the DA DA national spokesperson, Solly Malatsi\n\nThe latter this week tended in his resignation in accordance with the recommendations, however, Maimane remains adamant that he is still the right person for the job. Malatsi said that the outcomes of this weekend\u2019s meeting would help unsettle the questions that have been brewing in the media.\n\n\u201cThis weekend will help unsettle all the curiosity on everyone\u2019s mind about what is happening in the DA,\u201d said Malatsi\n\nWe must broaden our appeal to attract more black South Africans too Solly Malatsi, DA national spokesperson\n\nHe said just as South Africa needed to implement reforms if it was to grow its economy and prosper, the DA also needed to change if it was to grow. He stressed that as challenging as this may be, the DA needed to win the trust of the majority of South Africans, adding that the party could not content itself with being the voice of minorities.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must broaden our appeal to attract more black South Africans too.\u201d Writing in his weekly Bokamoso newsletter, Maimane said the party could not only be \u201cthe voice of minorities\u201d.\n\n\u201cTherefore, however challenging it may be, the DA needs to win the trust of the majority of South Africans. We cannot contend ourselves with being the voice of minorities; we must broaden our appeal to attract more black South Africans too.\u201d\n\nMalatsi said that Maimane called for party discipline in the meeting. When asked about the mood in the briefing, Malatsi described the mood as calm.\n\n\u201cThe mood is quite civil, tranquil and robust, no chairs have flown yet,\u201d said Malatsi.\n\nThis week, DA chief executive officer Boughey announced his resignation from the party on Thursday afternoon. The party said it \u201cnoted\u201d his decision and wished him \u201call the best in his future endeavours and thank him for his service to the DA and commitment to the broader democratic project\u201d.\n\nWhen questions of whether the same fate was to happen to Maimane arose, Malatsi said the council would revert to the media.", "description": "Under normal circumstances, the DA\u2019s federal council would meet once in every three years to discuss policy and other matters, but DA leader Mmusi Maimane has called for the first policy conference since the inception of the DA to broaden the discuss", "authors": ["Mandisa Nyathi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/131/2255fa50c0604e8c908a51ee6f522e63.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
