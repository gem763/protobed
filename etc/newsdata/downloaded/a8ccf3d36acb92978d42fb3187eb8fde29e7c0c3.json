Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nWhile none of the decisions were completely dispositive, we know Donald Trump interprets virtually every event \u2014 every sparrow that falls to the ground \u2014 as a personal W or L. So he probably wasn\u2019t happy today at three adverse developments in federal court.\n\nArguably the largest, given his effort to hide his many tracks, was a decision by a three-judge panel of the nation\u2019s most important appeals court, as the New York Times reports:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s accounting firm must comply with a House committee\u2019s demands for eight years of his financial records, a federal appeals court panel ruled on Friday in a major victory for House Democrats in their struggle against his vow to stonewall \u201call\u201d of their oversight subpoenas.\n\nIn a 66-page ruling, the panel rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that Congress had no legitimate legislative authority to seek his business records from the firm, Mazars USA, because the committee was trying to determine whether he broke existing laws \u2014 not weighing whether to enact a new one.\n\n\u201cHaving considered the weighty issues at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable,\u201d wrote Judge David S. Tatel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nA Republican-appointed judge on the panel dissented, saying the subpoena exceeded Congress\u2019s legislative powers. The administration will almost certainly appeal the ruling either to the full D.C. Circuit or to the Supreme Court. But it could face more headwinds since the courts may give greater deference to Congress\u2019s subpoena powers now that it is formally engaged in an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe records the House Oversight Committee is seeking, be it noted, include closely guarded Trump tax records.\n\nTeam Trump also experienced two legal setbacks on the president\u2019s signature immigration turf. It was hit with a bicoastal double whammy against the administration\u2019s efforts to block immigration via an expanded notion of what constitutes a \u201cpublic charge\u201d \u2014 a burden on U.S. taxpayers. NBC News explains:\n\nFederal judges in New York and California on Friday ordered a nationwide block in cases challenging a Trump administration policy that would make it far easier for the government to deny legal status to immigrants who use or are deemed likely to use public assistance. The rule was set to go into effect next week.\n\nJudge George B. Daniels, of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, ordered preliminary injunctions Friday afternoon in two related cases against the administration\u2019s new \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule that could have denied legal permanent residency and other forms of legal status to many immigrants in the country who are deemed likely to use public assistance \u2026\n\nLater on Friday afternoon, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton issued a preliminary injunction in a case announced by California attorney general Xavier Becerra. California was joined by Maine, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C., in the lawsuit.\n\nIn the California decision, Hamilton wrote that the counties and states had demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm \u201cbased on their loss of Medicaid funding from the federal government and increased operational costs they are likely to carry.\u201d\n\nFor dessert in this judicial three-course meal of bad chow, Trump had another setback to his efforts to divert federal funds to pay for the border wall that Congress has refused to finance to his satisfaction. Politico has the story:\n\nAnother federal judge ruled against President Donald Trump\u2019s unorthodox plan to use billions of dollars in federal funds to extend the wall on the Mexican border, despite Congress\u2019s refusal to appropriate money for that purpose.\n\nEl Paso, Texas\u2013based U.S. District Court Judge David Briones\u2019s Friday decision not only rejected the funding scheme but went further than past rulings by specifically declaring \u201cunlawful\u201d an emergency proclamation Trump issued in February seeking to unlock money to fulfill one of his key campaign promises.\n\nLast year, a district-court judge in California blocked the funds as well, but the Supreme Court put the injunction aside on murky procedural grounds related to the plaintiff\u2019s standing to sue. It\u2019s unclear whether similar issues will bring SCOTUS to the administration\u2019s rescue once again.\n\nAll in all, it was a Friday to forget for this most litigious of presidents. At least the public bore the cost of his lawyers in these cases.", "description": "Trump lost three times in federal courts today, as a D.C. appeals court approved a congressional subpoena for financial records while one judge blocked his border wall gambit and another his effort to keep out immigrants as a burden on taxpayers.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/08/08-donald-trump-polygraph.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
