REUTERS/Sonali Paul\n\nTheir sentiments, reflected in passport paperwork and in interviews with residents, migration agents and real estate brokers across the globe, show the potential for human and capital flight out of Hong Kong.\n\nSince an abortive push to allow extradition to mainland China sparked unrest in the former British colony three months ago, emigration seminars have been overflowing, organizers and attendees say.\n\nRequests for police-record printouts, which cost HK$225 ($29) and are only issued for visa applications or child adoptions, jumped 54% to 3,649 in August compared with last year. There have been more requests in 2019 so far than at the same point in any of the previous five years.\n\nIn 2017, the most recent year for which figures are available, there were 75 adoptions in Hong Kong, a number comparable to previous years. The Hong Kong government estimates that last year about 7,600 people left the city for good, roughly one-third the number who sought police-record printouts.\n\nAuthorities in Malaysia, Australia and Taiwan have reported spikes in migration enquiries, and property agents from Melbourne to Vancouver say their phones are running hot.\n\n\u201cThere are many uncertainties in Hong Kong,\u201d one investor on a property agent\u2019s late-August tour of suburban Melbourne said before, laying out A$600,000 ($410,000) for a house-and-land package.\n\n\u201cPeople like me in their 40s and 50s - we think about our child,\u201d said the investor, who gave only her family name, Lee, because her employer forbids speaking to the media.\n\n\u201cWe want a back-up home, a better place to live,\u201d she added. \u201cAt least if something bad happens, they have a back-up plan, an exit plan.\u201d\n\nAnd she is not alone: Lee\u2019s sentiments were echoed in interviews with 10 other families or individuals considering emigrating.\n\nChina has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and the Hong Kong government has sought to head off further trouble by accepting one of the protesters\u2019 demands and withdrawing the extradition bill.\n\nA mass march scheduled for Sunday will test how far that has allayed public anger.\n\nPASSPORT PLEASE\n\nAs Hong Kong\u2019s protests have expanded during the summer, swelling to million-strong marches and calls for democracy, so too have Hong Kongers\u2019 searches for safe havens.\n\nIn June, lawyers and bankers told Reuters that wealthy tycoons were shifting their fortunes to places like Singapore.\n\nNow, migration agents say, middle-class families are checking out cheaper alternatives.\n\n\u201cThe numbers are the highest in recent years, even higher than 2014,\u201d said Peggy Lau, a sales director at Uni Immigration Consultancy in Hong Kong, where enquiries have surged sevenfold since protests began in June.\n\nTo be sure, there is no official data tracking emigration applications from Hong Kong, which has a population of about 7 million. Nor is there evidence of departures or cash outflows on the scale of those in the aftermath of the 1997 handover from Britain to China.\n\nBut there are firm signs of preparations.\n\nFavored destinations such as Malaysia, which is relatively cheap, and Taiwan, which is culturally similar to Hong Kong, show sharp rises in interest.\n\nAt Johor, near Malaysia\u2019s southern tip, property consultant Bruce Lee said Hong Kongers have poured into a project called Forest City, developed by China\u2019s Country Garden Holdings Co Ltd, buying 800 units since June.\n\nThat compares with 200 units purchased between then and 2016, when sales began.\n\nThe number of visas issued to Hong Kongers in Taiwan in June and July was 38% higher, at 884, than in the same period a year ago, according to the island\u2019s Ministry of the Interior National Immigration Agency.\n\nEnquiries by Hong Kongers at Immigration@SG LLP, an immigration consultancy in Singapore, rose by roughly a quarter in the past two months compared with earlier in the year, said a company spokesman, Muhammad Ryhan.\n\nState authorities in Australia have noted a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in visa enquiries from Hong Kong, but declined to give details. Immigration agents have said there is also growing interest in Canada, the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nIn New Zealand, the number of monthly applicants for residency visas from Hong Kong passport holders hit 34 in June and 44 in July, modestly higher than the average of 29.\n\n\u2018A SAFE HAVEN\u2019\n\nThere are signs that property investors are laying the groundwork for a move as well.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s famously frothy real estate market, worth $1.3 trillion, is shrinking, with prices edging lower for a second consecutive month in July and transaction volumes forecast to hit a six-month low.\n\nPeter Wong, a property agent in Sydney, has taken a half-dozen calls from Hong Kong buyers in the last month, the first he can remember in decades. Some agents have also reported sudden interest in Taiwan and Vancouver.\n\nThere are no signs yet of an effect on prices in destination markets, but demand is strong enough that agents and developers say they have begun actively courting Hong Kongers.\n\n\u201cWe see there is an opportunity,\u201d said Ken Dodds, sales director at Melbourne homebuilder Resimax, which hosted 43 Hong Kong investors last month, after previously focusing on buyers from Malaysia and Singapore.\n\n\u201cPeople are keen to look for a safe haven,\u201d he said, adding that the investors bought or reserved a dozen properties, which he described as a \u201cgreat\u201d result.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nIt is a trend some in the market expect to continue.\n\n\u201cThis episode has planted a seed in many Hong Kongers with Canadian ties to begin the process of moving money, assets, and family out of Hong Kong and back to Canada,\u201d Dan Scarrow, president of Vancouver-based Macdonald Realty told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThis process will play out over the coming years, not over the coming weeks,\u201d he said.", "description": "As protests in Hong Kong stretch from summer into autumn with little sign of resolution, a surge in migration applications suggests more locals are making plans to leave the special administrative region.", "authors": ["Clare Jim", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429371900&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C05I", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
