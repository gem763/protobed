Visa\u2019s continued interest in Libra stems from our belief that well-regulated blockchain-based networks could extend the value of secure digital payments to a greater number of people and places, particularly in emerging and developing markets.\u201d\n\nLibra\u2019s payment partners just got a lot thinner now that Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard are leaving the project. (Screenshot: Libra Association)\n\nThe concern about Libra meeting regulatory guidelines is especially pertinent as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify in front of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services on October 24.\n\nNow that PayPal, Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard have left the Libra Association, there are only two remaining payment partners in Libra\u2019s stable\u2014Mercado Pago and PayU\u2014neither of which have major footprints in the U.S.\n\nAnd with so many big names having recently pulled back their support for Libra, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if even more partners caught a case of cold feet and decided to leave as well. Additionally, big established institutions working with Facebook on the cryptocurrency has been a key factor in its efforts to give the project legitimacy and assuage any fears based on Facebook\u2019s sketchy reputation.\n\nHowever, it seems the Libra Association remains undeterred, with a statement from the company\u2019s head of communication Dante Disparte saying: \u201cWe are focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association of some of the world\u2019s leading enterprises, social impact organisations and other stakeholders to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-friendly implementation of a global payment system that breaks down financial barriers for billions of people.\u201d\n\nOK, well good luck with that.", "description": "Following the departure of PayPal from Facebook\u2019s Libra project\u2014a cryptocurrency that promises to \u201creinvent money\u201d and \u201ctransform the global economy\u201d\u2014a new wave of departures has rocked the platform as eBay, Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard have all announced that they are abandoning ship....", "authors": ["George Dvorsky", "Jennings Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/bk628lbkrmxsb0ylviva.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
