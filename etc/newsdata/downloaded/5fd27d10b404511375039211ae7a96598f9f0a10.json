Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s remarks about his legal plans were made over the weekend in a series of calls with Yahoo News, amid cable news appearances in which he continued to aggressively defend the president. That defense was blunted by news of an additional whistleblower who would reportedly corroborate how Trump allegedly pressured the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, into investigating Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate.\n\nRudolph Giuliani and Rep. Adam Schiff (Photos: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters, Mark Wilson/Getty Images) More\n\nIn several conversations with Yahoo News, Giuliani dismissed at least one critic of such a lawsuit as a \u201cnitwit,\u201d arguing that there were no constitutional constraints on bringing such litigation against sitting members of Congress.\n\n\u201cI got the highest grade in constitutional law,\u201d said Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. He revealed that private lawyers are studying public statements by Schiff and others to argue that they were not merely prosecuting a case against Trump but attempting to \u201cdeprive him of civil rights\" and were engaging in a \u201cconspiracy to remove the president at all costs.\u201d Giuliani charged that Schiff was seeking to \u201cinhibit me in my ability to defend\u201d Trump.\n\nHe cited Tlaib\u2019s appearance at a recent town hall, in which she appeared to agree with a speaker who said that if White House officials were issued subpoenas and refused to comply with them, federal marshals should \u201chunt down\u201d those officials. Giuliani said that was tantamount to witness intimidation, though it is not clear that Tlaib strayed outside her First Amendment rights.\n\nTrump is certainly fond of litigation as a means of bringing opponents to heel, but suing sitting U.S. representatives would be an extraordinary development in an already extraordinary episode in American politics. Giuliani says that \u201ca very established law firm\u201d is already at work on that effort, though he would not say which one.\n\nRep.

If nothing else, the whole Ukraine affair has been a lesson in the Roy Cohn method of crisis management. And even as others are running away from what could be a presidency in nuclear meltdown, Giuliani is running right into the radioactive fire.\n\nIn recent days, he has defended Trump with unrestrained bluster that recalled some of his more colorful days as New York City\u2019s mayor. In one Fox News exchange, he called a skeptical fellow panelist a \u201cmoron.\u201d There have been so many such appearances that the Biden presidential campaign has asked television programs to no longer book the former federal prosecutor.\n\nCalls like that are likely to only enrage Giuliani further. And they aren\u2019t likely to quiet a man who, as the mayor of New York during the 1990s, relished battle with everyone from ferret owners to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.", "description": "Rudolph Giuliani says he is working with outside lawyers to prepare lawsuits against prominent Democrats such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California and Rep.
