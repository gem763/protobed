Franck Robichon/File Photo\n\nMILAN (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Ignazio Visco said on Saturday recent expansionary measures agreed by the bank were necessary to counter the risk of a return to deflation in the euro area.\n\nEarlier this month the ECB, in Mario Draghi\u2019s last policy meeting as the central bank\u2019s chief, pledged new indefinite stimulus to revive an ailing euro zone economy, a decision opposed by a third of the policymakers.\n\n\u201cWe must counter the significant risk that the economic slowdown and the low level of inflation translate into a permanent reduction in inflation expectations or a re-emergence of the threat of deflation,\u201d Visco said during a conference.\n\nVisco, the governor of the Italian central bank, added that experience gathered during the global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis taught that \u201cin these circumstances excessive prudence is counter-productive\u201d.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s move towards further monetary stimulus prompted open and strong criticism from several euro zone policymakers, including the central bank chiefs of Germany, France and the Netherlands, who voiced doubts about the need and effectiveness of a package that could consume most of the bank\u2019s remaining firepower.\n\nThis week, Sabine Lautenschlaeger, a German member of the ECB\u2019s board, decided to step down in what was seen as a further backlash against the latest stimulus measures.\n\nUsually soft-spoken, Visco said he did not think comments made by some governors after September\u2019s policy meeting were guided by preconceived ideas or by political considerations.\n\nHowever, he added it was important \u201cto avoid the risk that, also due to the extemporaneous nature of the remarks made, the positions of the individual council members be interpreted as an expression of national perspectives or interests\u201d.", "description": "European Central Bank policymaker Ignazio Visco said on Saturday recent expansionary measures agreed by the bank were necessary to counter the risk of a return to deflation in the euro area.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434951820&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0OJ", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
