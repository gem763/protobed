HARTNELL barrier (TBC) J Cummings \u2014 B Rawiller 58kg $\n\nSo honest, so good, for so long, so richly deserves one of the big Group 1 wins.\n\n2. MIRAGE DANCER barrier (TBC) T Busuttin/N Young \u2014 B Melham 56kg $\n\nMust lump a big weight but the son of Frankel has good form around England\u2019s best stayers.\n\n3. MER DE GLACE barrier (TBC) H Shimiu \u2014 D Lane 55.5kg $\n\nA three-time Group 3 winner in Japan going for five consecutive wins. Top contender.\n\n4. MUSTAJEER barrier (TBC) K Lees \u2014 D Oliver 55.5kg $\n\nHas the right jockey to be in the finish but Ebor winners have not had a lot of luck Down Under.\n\n5. ROSTROPOVICH barrier (TBC) D Hayes, B Hayes & T Dabernig \u2014 D Dunn 55.5kg $\n\nOne-time Lindsay Park spring flagbearer before Home Of The Brave\u2019s emphatic win, would want to improve.\n\n6. FINCHE barrier (TBC) C Waller \u2014 M Walker 54.5kg $\n\nThe flashy chestnut, who deserves to be favourite, would win Fashions on the Field hands down. Striking animal.\n\n7. GOLD MOUNT barrier (TBC) I Williams \u2014 M Du Plessis 54.5kg $\n\nShould be strong at the back end of the race but all eyes on first Tuesday in November.\n\n8. RED VERDON barrier (TBC) E Dunlop \u2014 P Cosgrave 54.5kg $\n\nSame owner, same trainer as popular Melbourne Cup runner Red Cadeaux so should be considered for exotics.\n\n9. ANGEL OF TRUTH barrier (TBC) G Markwell \u2014 D Yendall 54kg $\n\nWon the Australian Derby with a leg in the air but has been beaten a long way out in three starts this time in.\n\n10. BIG DUKE barrier (TBC) K Lees \u2014 B Prebble 54kg $\n\nOld stager motored late in The Metropolitan to finish fifth, will be thereabouts but looking for further.\n\n11. CONSTANTINOPLE barrier (TBC) D Hayes, B Hayes & T Dabernig \u2014 L Nolen 53kg $\n\nIf Lindsay Park supremo David Hayes is excited about the import bought specifically with Cups riches in mind then who are we to knock that? Stable on fire.\n\n12. MR QUICKIE barrier (TBC) P Stokes \u2014 J Allen 53kg $\n\nRedemption time? The distance will not be an issue and as long as the Turnbull run is an aberration can win.\n\n13. CROWN PROSECUTOR barrier (TBC) S Marsh \u2014 C Grylls 52.5kg $\n\nCapable Kiwi visitor, who savaged the line last start at Group 1 level across the ditch, not without a chance.\n\n14. VOW AND DECLARE barrier (TBC) D O\u2019Brien \u2014 C Williams 52.5kg $\n\nWeighted to be in the finish, if not win, and put in the pick of the Cup \u201ctrials\u201d in the Turnbull Stakes.\n\n15. BRIMHAM ROCKS barrier (TBC) C Waller \u2014 M Dee 52kg $\n\nWon at big odds at Caulfield then did nothing in the Metropolitan. Top 10 maybe.\n\n16. THE CHOSEN ONE barrier (TBC) M Baker & A Forsman \u2014 S Baster 52kg $\n\nNeeded to improve third up and did with emphatic win. Quick back, lightly weight just needs a gate.\n\n17. QAFILA barrier (TBC) D Hayes, B Hayes & T Dabernig \u2014 C Parish 51.5kg $\n\nOnly battled last start and despite winning SA Derby deep in preparation just not going well enough.\n\n18. WOLFE barrier (TBC) G Waterhouse, A Bott \u2014 B Mertens 51.5kg $\n\nLightly-raced and gutsy effort to qualify but a bridge too far on extreme back-up from Wednesday.\n\nEMERGENCIES\n\n19.
