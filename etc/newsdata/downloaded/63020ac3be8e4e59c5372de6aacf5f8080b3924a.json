They had Chinese flags and signs which say, \"It's everyone's duty to eradicate pests.\"\n\n\n\nThis flag ended up on the floor and squished by one of their signs.#Photography #Photojournalism #China #\u7231\u56fd pic.twitter.com/aZTvT0gHkR\n\nIn Birmingham, Hong Kong students at an event in the city on 12 October said they had been followed and filmed by older Chinese men and grabbed by one who attempted to remove a student\u2019s mask. The next day, the same men turned up at Aston University\u2019s campus at a documentary film screening by Hong Kong students, and were later blocked by security.\n\nThe university told the Guardian that its security team had refused re-entry to the event to a small number of individuals whose behaviour had been disruptive. Adding that it was aware of incidents in the city centre, the university said its priority was to ensure the safety of students, while protecting freedom of speech.\n\nOne Hong Kong student said: \u201cAlthough physical assaults are also one of our major concerns, what worries me the most is how they would use the footage and photos that they took during these events.\u201d\n\nIn Leeds, Hong Kong activists accused the city\u2019s university of protecting its image after it contacted them to express concerns about a planned event bordering on university property that was expected to be the focus of a counter-protest by pro-Bejing Chinese students.\n\nIn an email seen by the Guardian, the university wrote to the students to insist it was committed to freedom of expression, but the number of people expected to attend the event and the proximity to a road meant \u201cwe were not persuaded that adequate arrangements could be made to safeguard all members of our community within the vicinity\u201d.\n\nIn Newcastle, about 30 Hong Kong protesters encountered more than 100 pro-Beijing counter-protesters in the city centre, watched over by a handful of police.\n\nOne activist who was handing out flyers for the Hong Kong protest told of being photographed and filmed and having conversations with passersby interrupted.\n\n\u201cThe mainland Chinese didn\u2019t stop chanting and shouting and even swore at some of us. It was intimidating and hindering,\u201d the student said, adding that the rally had been brought to an end 45 minutes earlier than planned on the basis of police advice.\n\nOther university cities where Hong Kong student activists have complained of being harassed include Reading and Manchester, which has the largest population of Chinese students in Europe. About 5,000 attend the University of Manchester, which has a high profile in China.\n\nPosts on Chinese language social media platforms by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association Manchester (CSSA-MAN), a network of Chinese students and scholars in the north-west whose website states that they are backed by the Chinese government, have highlighted the location and times of events being held by Hong Kong activists. Counter-protests were also encouraged by the Leeds branch of the CSSA.\n\nHong Kong activists who took part in a protest on 13 October in Manchester told the Guardian of being filmed and having eggs thrown at them. Counter-protesters waving Chinese flags attempted to drown them out with loud music when they tried to speak to local people.\n\nOne activist who attended the protest said they had been receiving \u201cdisturbing\u201d messages after the encounter between the two groups: \u201cI am quite intimidated by their threatening behaviour. I think some Chinese students have recognised me even under the mask and proceeded to create fake accounts just for the purpose of anonymous cyber-harassment.\u201d\n\nApplications from Chinese students to study at UK universities have gone up 30% since last year, with numbers exceeding those from Northern Ireland for the first time. The Ucas university admissions agency received almost 20,000 undergraduate applications from Chinese students. The overseas student community is estimated to be worth \u00a320bn to the UK economy.", "description": "Police have been called to intervene and separate groups at events in university cities", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897f1d5d561762c75145aca0faab9dbf39f3d039/0_85_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe4579f8dc55fd95e4d871f43adde81f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
