The Liberals\u2019 share of the popular vote fell throughout the country as it was losing its hold over the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the fact that the shine has come off the Trudeau brand,\u201d said Andrew McDougall, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Canada Elections-Canada-Results.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
