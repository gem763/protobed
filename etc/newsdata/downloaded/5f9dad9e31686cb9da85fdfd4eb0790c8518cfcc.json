She said in response to a question from journalist Katie Couric that the site doesn\u2019t run ads for money, as it is a \u201cvery small part of our revenue,\u201d acknowledging that the ads are also \u201cvery controversial.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo one of the most controversial things out there right now is what ads do we take, what ads do others take, and do we fact check political ads?\u201d she said in response to Couric. \u201cAnd it is a hard conversation and emotions are running really high on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why are we doing this?\u201d Sandberg posited. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the money. Let\u2019s start there. This is a very small part of our revenue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take political ads because we really believe they are part of political discourse and that taking political ads means that people can speak,\u201d Sandberg said at the summit, per a video of the event. \u201cIf you look at this over time, the people who have the most benefited from being able to run ads are people who are not covered by the media so they can\u2019t get their message out otherwise, people who are challenging an in incumbent \u2026 and people who have different points of view.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump reportedly spent $1.6 million on advertising on Facebook with misleading and debunked claims about former Vice President Joe Biden in relation to the whistleblower scandal in which both politicians are entangled. Facebook did take down one of Trump\u2019s ad, but only because he called Biden a \u201cb\u2014h,\u201d which violated the platform\u2019s policy on profanity.\n\nRead more: Facebook is strengthening its rules for political ads ahead of the 2020 election, but there\u2019s a big loophole that has nothing to do with Facebook\n\nThe social media site confirmed earlier this month that these ads were allowed to run, because Facebook ads from politicians are not eligible for third-party fact-checking. The platform\u2019s policies caught the ire of 2020 Democratic frontrunner Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who ran a fake ad about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg endorsing Trump\u2019s re-election to raise awareness of misinformation spreading on the site.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked,\u201d the ad read. \u201cAnd you might be thinking, \u2018how could this possibly be true?'\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not. (Sorry.)\u201d\n\nAt the summit, Sandberg also dismissed the notion that Facebook\u2019s algorithm displaying content that reinforces a user\u2019s belief. The COO said that 26% of the news a user sees on their newsfeed \u201cwill be from another point of view.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been under scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators over how the platform was used to spread of disinformation during the 2016 campaign, user privacy following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, antitrust issues, and its formation of a cryptocurrency. The Federal Trade Commission required Facebook to pay $5 billion as part of a settlement over privacy violations.\n\nOn Tuesday, 47 attorneys general are joining New York State Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 investigation into potential Facebook antitrust violations.\n\nSen. Warren has called for Facebook to be broken up. Sandberg was also asked about this issue.\n\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t want Facebook to be broken up, because we think we\u2019re able to provide in great services across the board,\u201d she said in response.\n\nSandberg also said she was staying out of the primary, when asked if she would support Warren if she were the Democratic nominee for president in 2020: \u201cI\u2019m not in the primary right now \u2026 but I\u2019m a very well-understood Democrat. I was a supporter of Hillary Clinton. I have spoken for many years about the desire for my daughter and yours to see a woman as president.\u201d", "description": "Business Insider - Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said the platform doesn't run ads for money, but because \"we really believe they are part of political discourse.\".
