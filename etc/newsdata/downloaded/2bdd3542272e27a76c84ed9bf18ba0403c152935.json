It bought the rights to \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and now it\u2019s using its outsized checkbook to bring beloved Japanese animation group Studio Ghibli\u2019s films onto the web exclusively on its platform for U.S. subscribers.\n\nAll 21 films from the studio \u2014 including classics like \u201cPrincess Mononoke,\u201d \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and \u201cHowl\u2019s Moving Castle\u201d \u2014 will be coming in 2020. \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d will be coming to the service in fall of 2020; the rest will come earlier in the spring.\n\nThis deal is hugely noteworthy for Studio Ghibli, as their classic films weren\u2019t available to watch or download online legally in any capacity. It also seems that much of that was on purpose, and it seems that this long-held belief was changed with some of that HBO moola.\n\nTerms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed, but here\u2019s what a representative told Polygon this year:\n\n\u201cStudio Ghibli does not make their films available digitally, whether for download or streaming, anywhere in the world\u2026 They continue to believe that presentation is vital and particularly appreciate opportunities for audiences to experience the films together in a theatrical setting.\u201d\n\nThis is a big win for HBO because anyone would\u2019ve assumed that Studio Ghibli would\u2019ve partnered with Disney, if anyone, for a streaming deal, given their long-term relationship. But HBO Max seems to be keeping the checkbook handy, and won this deal because of it.", "description": "HBO\u2019s streaming services have long succeeded on the strength of original programming, but in a post-AT&T acquisition world, the company is having to create a streaming service supergroup of exceptional content to lure consumers into coughing up more cash.
