You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nInstead, separate motions are expected to be put to a vote at the party's annual conference on Monday, one calling for Labour to back remain and another endorsing a policy of neutrality.\n\nLabour's gathering in Brighton has been dominated by infighting, after an abortive eve-of-conference effort to oust deputy leader Tom Watson, and the dramatic resignation of Mr Corbyn's senior aide Andrew Fisher.\n\nHowever John McDonnell, who has vowed to support Remain, dismissed the reports of splits as \"a bit of banter\" and said the leadership's position was \"logical\".\n\nLabour's plan, pushed by Mr Corbyn, says the party should only decide how to campaign in a referendum at a special conference held after a general election.\n\nBut pro-Remain activists stood firm during a late-night meeting in Brighton, where a motion championing their position was also put forward.\n\nAndrew Lewin, founder of Remain Labour, said: \"This is a huge step forward.\n\n\"Labour members will tomorrow have the chance to change party policy - so Labour commits to campaign to Remain in all circumstances.\"\n\nHowever the results will hinge on whether influential trade unions decide to back Mr Corbyn's position, or to shift towards a pro-Remain stance.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This reflects the opinion of the vast majority of our members and voters.\n\n\"Labour is already the only main party committed to a democratic vote on Brexit.\n\n\"If we add a commitment to Remain we will at last be providing the leadership the country needs, in contrast to the chaos offered by an increasingly extreme Conservative Party.\"\n\nAhead of the votes, Mr McDonnell said the party was simply engaged in \"honest, democratic debate\".\n\nThe shadow chancellor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"People have high emotions on this because they feel it's important. But that's not people respecting each other's views as well and there will be a bit of banter, of course there will.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
