(AP) - Losing both offensive tackles could have sunk the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nInstead, it made them tougher.\n\nThe 49ers (5-0) have continued to roll even though left tackle Joe Staley missed the past three games with a broken fibula and right tackle Mike McGlinchey missed the past game with cartilage damage in his knee.\n\nTheir replacements, Daniel Brunskill and Justin Skule, haven\u2019t been spectacular but they have helped the 49ers remain undefeated.\n\n\u201cThe two rookies did a great job stepping in and filling their roles,\u201d quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo said. \u201cThose guys are just battling up front. What they do in the run game and pass game is so impressive.\u201d\n\nBrunskill and Skule have replaced two of the best starting tackles in the NFL. McGlinchey and Staley are highly talented former first-round draft picks, and Staley is a six-time Pro Bowler. Brunskill and Skule don\u2019t have much pedigree. Skule is a rookie sixth-round pick, and Brunskill was an undrafted free agent in 2017.\n\n\u201cThey are both pretty quiet,\u201d Garoppolo said. \u201cThey will talk when they are in the conversation or something like that. On the field they\u2019re different, though. It\u2019s so cool, that dog that comes out in them. Screaming at people, in a good way.\u201d\n\nThird-year tight end George Kittle frequently lined up next to Brunskill and liked the right tackle\u2019s consistency. \u201cI guess that\u2019s all you can really ask for when you\u2019re replacing McGlinchey,\u201d Kittle said. \u201cDan went in there and did his job and did it well. No mistakes.\u201d\n\nBrunskill spent the past two seasons on the Atlanta Falcons practice squad, then played this spring for the San Diego Fleet in the now defunct Alliance of American Football. The 49ers signed him on April 12. Since then, he regularly has picked the brains of Staley and McGlinchey.\n\n\u201cThey see things you might not have seen about a guy that\u2019s rushing against you,\u201d Brunskill said. \u201cMike is a younger guy, so he can help me with different things he has been learning. Then you also have Joe, who knows everything and has seen it all.\u201d\n\nSkule played college football at Vanderbilt. He made his second career start at left tackle during Sunday\u2019s 20-7 victory over the Los Angeles Rams and gave up one sack to Aaron Donald.\n\n\u201cObviously, a lot to fix,\u201d Skule said. \u201cI gave up the sack and a couple other pressures. Definitely a ton to learn from.\u201d\n\nSkule was hard on himself but coach Kyle Shanahan gave him and Brunskill positive reviews for their performances against the Rams.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t perfect the entire game, but they\u2019re one of the reasons we won. They allowed us to run it and they played with toughness,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tough position to be in, especially (against) some of those pass rushers.\n\n\u201cThey got Donald one-on-one on Skule on the very first pass play, and he ended up giving up a sack. A lot of guys giving up a sack in a big game like that, they can kind of melt. They can lose their confidence and it takes some time to get it back. Skule went right back out there the next third down and did a good job blocking.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers hope Staley will return in Week 9 and expect McGlinchey to return between Week 9 and Week 11. Until then, the 49ers will embrace the challenge of playing without them.\n\n\u201cI think it has made our offense tougher,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cThe guys are a lot more resilient. I think the guys start to develop the mentality that it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s out there. It\u2019s been a credit to our guys that they\u2019ve been able to get that confidence now going on for a few weeks. We\u2019re going to need that to keep going for a few more weeks until we get some of these guys back.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Losing both offensive tackles could have sunk the San Francisco 49ers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Grant Cohn"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
