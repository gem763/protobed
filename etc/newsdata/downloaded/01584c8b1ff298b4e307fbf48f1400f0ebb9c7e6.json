The precious objects bringing comfort to Syrian refugees 1/26 Syrian refugee children attending Unicef Makani centres in Za'atari refugee camp share the stories behind the objects they brought from Syria and the powerful memories that they represent Photos Unicef/Christopher Herwig 2/26 Omar, 11, holds his teddy bear Ben 10 \u2018My Ben 10 transforms into an alien from space and he saves the world,\u2019 says the 11-year-old. \u2018I brought it from Syria. My brother gave it to me before he died.\u2019 Omar lost both of his older brothers in the conflict. His brother Abdulrahman was just 7 years old when he died. 'He bought it for me in the market and told me to take care of it. We used to watch the cartoon together. I still watch it now.' He doesn't remember much about his home in Syria but he thinks it was as big as a Unicef Makani centre, where he goes for learning and psychosocial support. 'Most of our stuff we had to leave behind but my mum packed Ben 10 so I could play with it. It's so important to me. This toy is as precious to me as my own brother. I'm going to keep it forever.' Unicef/Herwig 3/26 Omar The best part of Omar\u2019s day is sunset when he comes home from school and Makani, eats food and does his homework sitting with his family. His favourite subject is maths and he studies hard to achieve his dream. \u2018I want to become a pilot. I used to be afraid of planes but now I want to travel. Maybe if I get on a plane I won\u2019t be afraid anymore.\u2019 Omar now has two little sisters in Za\u2019atari Refugee Camp. He lets his youngest sister Islam play with Ben 10. When he gets dirty he puts him in the washing machine. \u2018I\u2019m the only boy now. I think my brother would be proud of me.\u2019 Makani (which translates as \u2018My Space\u2019) centres provide an integrated set of services to children in the camp, including learning support, community-based child protection, early childhood development, adolescent and youth participation, life skills and innovation labs Unicef/Herwig 4/26 Yahya, 13, holds a passport photo of himself \u2018This is a photo of me. It\u2019s my memory. It means a lot to me because it was taken for my school registration form. I was in the first grade for only one week and then we had to come here. I have memories from this time, both good and bad. I remember how my school looked, it was beautiful. I had started making friends and playing football. But the bad memories are of the war, when we were under bombing. I want to forget this memory and the memory of the journey here. It was night time when we left Syria and we could hardly see the road in front of us. We moved through valleys full of thorns that hurt when we stepped on them. People started throwing away their belongings because of how hard the journey was, anything heavy had to go. I had to leave behind my school books, my pens and my colours because my mum told me too. She said it wouldn\u2019t be long before we came back home. But it\u2019s been six years.\u2019 He is now in sixth grade Unicef/Herwig 5/26 Qusai, 13, holds a schoolbag \u2018I was in first grade in Syria and my dad gave me this schoolbag. I was only little then but now I\u2019m in the sixth grade.\u2019 Although the schoolbag is now too small for him, he keeps it safe. \u2018It\u2019s important to me because my father gave it to me as a gift and I remember him by it. Also because it is from my country.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 6/26 Qusai He still has happy memories from life in Syria, including going to school. \u2018I used to feel really happy when break came and I could go to the shop. I remember playing in the schoolyard, my friends chasing me and me chasing them.\u2019 Although he preferred his school in Syria, he still enjoys going to school in the camp. His favourite subject is English and he wants to become an English teacher. He has no plans to give up the old schoolbag. \u2018I will keep this schoolbag forever. I will tell my children my father gave this to me and I kept it safe for all these years to show you.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 7/26 Ayoub, 13, holds a set of spoons \u2018These are my spoons. I was six when I left Syria. I wanted to take them with me from Syria as a memory so I grabbed them as we were leaving the house and I carried them the whole way here. I used to eat my meals with them back at home so I thought that I am going to need them to eat when I come to the camp.\u2019 Ayoub has dropped out of school in the camp but he continues to attend a Makani centre for learning and psychosocial support. \u2018When I grow up, I want to be a taxi driver because I want to leave the camp and go everywhere. I\u2019ve been in a taxi before and I loved it. Inside the camp we don\u2019t have taxis, only bicycles. I\u2019m not in school so I can\u2019t be a doctor or an engineer but I think it\u2019s the easiest thing for me to do when I grow up. In Za'atari, there are 13 Makani centres serving over 7,000 children. Located in every district of the camp, vulnerable children, youth and communities have access to Makani, no matter where they live Unicef/Herwig 8/26 Hamza, 14, holds a handwritten note, from his teacher in Syria \u2018This note was written by my teacher when I was in first grade in Syria. It\u2019s a thank you letter to my family saying that I am a good student.\u2019 The note calls Hamza a star. \u2018I made sure to put it in my bag when we were coming here.\u2019 Hamza is now in the eighth grade and has made a big effort to keep achieving academically, despite the disruption to his education. \u2018It\u2019s important for me to keep it because it reminds me of when I was the best student in my class.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 9/26 Mohammad, 16, holds his hat \u2018This is my hat. My father used to work in Damascus. He bought it there and gave it to me. Life then was magnificent.\u2019 He still remembers the beginning of the conflict in Syria. \u2018Children were being killed and houses were being bombed. My father feared for our lives and for our future. When we had to leave Syria, it was winter. I remember crossing a valley and the ground being difficult to walk on. It was dangerous, cars were sliding on the ice.\u2019 Mohammad brought as much of his clothing as he could carry to Za\u2019atari but the hat remains his most loved item. \u2018I wore it all the way crossing to Jordan and I still wear it every winter. It\u2019s so precious, it reminds me of Syria. And it\u2019s a gift from my Dad which is why it means so much to me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 10/26 Mohammad Mohammad lives with his parents and brothers and sisters in the camp. He is in tenth grade and likes school. He feels like the camp is home because he is surrounded by his family and a bigger Syrian community who keep their memories alive. \u2018My parents tell me about when we were little. They say that Syria was beautiful. I will go back home to my village and continue living there. I will bring my hat and tell my children everything about my story.\u2019 When asked if it\u2019s important for children in Za\u2019atari to try to remember Syria when some of the memories are so traumatic, he replies straight away: \u2018Both. I think it\u2019s very important to keep memories but also to forget the horrors of war.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 11/26 Ahmad, 12, holds a key ring inscribed with his father's name \u2018This key ring belonged to my dad, I inherited it from him a long time ago. He died of a heart attack at the start of the war in Syria. I barely have any memories of my dad but the few I have are very precious. My favourite memory is the time he brought us to the river for a picnic and we played in the water. If I want to remember him, I take out his key ring and look at it.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 12/26 Ahmad Ahmad wants to be an architect when he grows us because his father worked in construction. \u2018I still have a long way to go as I am only in the sixth grade but I will do my best. It would make my Dad proud of me.\u2019 Ahmad lives with his grandmother and brother in the camp. Although they don\u2019t have much, he says that their love is enough for him Unicef/Herwig 13/26 Yara, 10, holds a doll \u2018This toy is from Syria. Her name is Farah.\u2019 Yara\u2019s father gave her Farah for her birthday. \u2018He used to buy me so many things.\u2019 She enjoys taking off Farah\u2019s dress, washing it and dressing her again. \u2018I take care of her because I love her. I feel happy when I\u2019m with her. I take her everywhere. I sleep with her. I tell her the story of Little Red Riding Hood \u2013 it\u2019s about a wolf - to put her to sleep.\u2019 Yara still has memories of her bedroom in Syria. \u2018It was white and I had teddy bears and one was really big. Bigger than me. It got scary in Syria. There were shootings. Dad said get your stuff together, we\u2019re going. I wanted to bring that teddy bear here but my parents said no, it was too big. So I put Farah in my bag. I told her we\u2019re going to Za\u2019atari. I told her don\u2019t made any sound because if you do, we can\u2019t go in. She was scared Unicef/Herwig 14/26 Yara We were both happy when we arrived in Za\u2019atari. I brought a pink dress too just like Farah\u2019s. I am never going to get rid of her. I have so many toys, even one that costs 5 JD, but I love this one.\u2019 Yara goes to school in the camp and wants to be a pharmacist when she grows up so she can give people medicine that will heal them. She wants to return to Syria. \u2018I will dress her up and get her ready and we will go. But this time, I\u2019m bringing all of my toys Unicef/Herwig 15/26 Hala, 11, holding a photo of her and her older brother in Syria \u2018My favourite photo is me and my brother together. It was a Friday. My mum had dressed me nicely for Friday prayer, then we went to the market and a restaurant. After that we went to a photographer\u2019s studio where this photo was taken.\u2019 Hala keeps her photos from Syria hidden in her closet to keep them safe. She takes them out from time to time to look at them. \u2018I only remember the war. I used to be so afraid. Bombs used to fall all around our house. Without photos, I wouldn\u2019t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren\u2019t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It\u2019s pure happiness.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 16/26 Hala Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. \u2018I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.\u2019 As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. \u2018I have to be courageous and not fear anything.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 17/26 Rudaina, 11, holds house keys \u2018These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I\u2019m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 18/26 Rudaina Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. \u2018We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I\u2019m so far away from home. Unicef/Herwig 19/26 Nour, 12, holds a blanket \u2018This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That\u2019s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 20/26 Nour Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. \u2018I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I\u2019m going to keep it as long as I can.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 21/26 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She\u2019s a gift from my mum so she\u2019s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 22/26 Iman These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad. She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. \u2018I will keep Lulu forever.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 23/26 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father \u2018That\u2019s my father\u2019s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn\u2019t bring with me.\u2019 Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. \u2018I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father\u2019s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.\u2019 *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig 24/26 Shatha, 15, holds a toy dog \u2018I brought this dog,\u2019 says Shath. \u2018I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don\u2019t remember much. When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za\u2019atari. \u2018The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we\u2019re getting an education. We have friends and parties Unicef/Herwig 25/26 Shatha Shatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. \u2018I love the Makani, it\u2019s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. \u2018My toy dog will always be with me. I\u2019ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it\u2019s the same as mine.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 26/26 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father \u2018That photo was taken in Syria. It\u2019s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn\u2019t come with us and he died in Syria.\u2019 Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. \u2018I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.\u2019 If my dad was here now he would ask me \u201cwhat do you want to be when your grow up\u201d and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you\u2019. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig 1/26 Syrian refugee children attending Unicef Makani centres in Za'atari refugee camp share the stories behind the objects they brought from Syria and the powerful memories that they represent Photos Unicef/Christopher Herwig 2/26 Omar, 11, holds his teddy bear Ben 10 \u2018My Ben 10 transforms into an alien from space and he saves the world,\u2019 says the 11-year-old. \u2018I brought it from Syria.

Without photos, I wouldn\u2019t know what it was like to be a kid in Syria. Because Syria is in my heart, it is my country where I was born. When I look at this photo, I remember those days again. There aren\u2019t enough words to describe the life I see in these photos. It\u2019s pure happiness.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 16/26 Hala Hala missed two years of her education because of the conflict, one in Syria and one in Jordan. Now she is in the fourth grade. \u2018I love school a lot. Arabic is my favourite subject and I want to be a surgeon. My mum told me that it was her dream when she was a child to become one but she got married instead. I want her to fulfil her dream through me.\u2019 As well as getting a good education, Hala knows what it will take to achieve her dream. \u2018I have to be courageous and not fear anything.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 17/26 Rudaina, 11, holds house keys \u2018These are my house keys. I brought them with me because when we go back to Syria, I\u2019m going to be the one who opens the door. My parents tell me that Syria is beautiful. I was so little that I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 18/26 Rudaina Rudaina is in fourth grade and her favourite subject is Maths. She wants to be a pediatrician when she grows up. \u2018We once had a home but now we live in a caravan. I feel so sad when I hold the keys because I\u2019m so far away from home. Unicef/Herwig 19/26 Nour, 12, holds a blanket \u2018This is my blanket. When I was little and it was my birthday, my grandmother bought it for me. I remember that we had to flee because there was bombing. It was night time. That\u2019s why we came here. I was covered in it when I was little and I came here. It protected me against the cold and the rain. I was scared but my mum held me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 20/26 Nour Nour wants to be a teacher when she grows up. Her favourite subject is Social Studies because she likes it and her teacher. \u2018I still have feelings when I cover myself in this blanket. I feel sadness thinking about the old beautiful days in Syria. But I also feel protected and safe. I\u2019m going to keep it as long as I can.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 21/26 Iman, 13, holds her doll Her name is Lulu. She\u2019s a gift from my mum so she\u2019s very important. I love her! We brought her here from Syria. When I was little and upset, my parents would give me this toy and I would stop crying. I feel safe as long as Lulu is with me. When the war started and there was shooting, I used to hug her to feel safe. I remember coming here. It was at night and it was dark. On the journey I felt protected having her with me.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 22/26 Iman These days, having Lulu near still makes Iman feel better whenever she is afraid or sad. She keeps her hidden but still lets her little sister play with her. \u2018I will keep Lulu forever.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 23/26 Zaina*, 13, holding a framed photo of her father \u2018That\u2019s my father\u2019s photo. When I was in first grade he died in the war. I wanted to bring this with me when I came here. It was hanging on the wall. I saw my mother putting stuff together so I ran to the photo and took it off the wall and put it in her bag. I have many memories of all the toys he gave me that I couldn\u2019t bring with me.\u2019 Zaina has been living in the camp for six years. She is in sixth grade and her favourite subject is English. She wants to be a lawyer when she grows up. \u2018I wish to return to Syria and for life to be like it was before. I will put my father\u2019s photo back on the wall where it was hanging before.\u2019 *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig 24/26 Shatha, 15, holds a toy dog \u2018I brought this dog,\u2019 says Shath. \u2018I was little when we left Syria, only 8 or 9 years old. I don\u2019t remember much. When we had to leave, I took him with me, I was thinking he would protect me. I had so many toys to choose from but he was my favourite. I played with him a lot. I remember being on the bus here and sleeping a lot. I held him the whole way to Za\u2019atari. \u2018The camp was full of tents back then and life was hard, really hard. I kept getting lost. I never let go of my dog in those first days so he could protect me. Now life is sweet. We have these centres and schools and we\u2019re getting an education. We have friends and parties Unicef/Herwig 25/26 Shatha Shatha wants to be a lawyer when she grows up to protect herself and others. \u2018I love the Makani, it\u2019s my favourite place in the camp. We learn and we play here. I play lots of football and like the computers. \u2018My toy dog will always be with me. I\u2019ll tell my children my whole life story and his because it\u2019s the same as mine.\u2019 Unicef/Herwig 26/26 Sham*, 7, holding a photo of her father \u2018That photo was taken in Syria. It\u2019s important to me because my father died and I loved him so much. He used to tell me stories, stories about Syria. I loved his stories so much. One day he told me we were going to the camp in five days. He said the war is going to get bad so you have to go. He told me you will grow older and I need you to look after your mother. He wouldn\u2019t come with us and he died in Syria.\u2019 Sham says that if she ever lost the photos of her father, she would never stop looking for them. To keep them safe, she hides them in a bag and then hides the bag in their caravan. She goes to school and is in the second grade. \u2018I like to go to school to learn. Science is my favourite subject. I study hard so I can practice on my own without using the books.\u2019 If my dad was here now he would ask me \u201cwhat do you want to be when your grow up\u201d and I would say, I want to be an engineer just like you\u2019. He would be really proud of me. *name changed to protect identity Unicef/Herwig\n\nBut instead, through sheer grit and determination, he became the exception to the rule. This week, after a long and exhaustive selection process, he touched down in the UK to take up a scholarship at a prestigious boarding school in Wales.\n\nIn doing so he became one of only a handful of Syrian refugees to make it to the UK without being part of a resettlement programme and with no help from the government.\n\n\u201cI never dreamed I would be successful,\u201d he says, speaking to The Independent in his now empty apartment in the town of Bar Elias, just days before he is due to leave for the UK\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, when I first applied, I was really upset and miserable and hopeless. There are lots of programmes and scholarships like this. I was applying but I'm pretty sure it's not going to make any difference.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to see why Nour was so pessimistic. The town of Bar Elias, where he has spent the last three years of his life, is home to thousands of refugees from neighbouring Syria. It sits just off the main road between Beirut and Damascus, around ten miles from the Syrian border.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Seven years ago, when he was 10-years-old, his mother was killed by an airstrike that hit their neighbourhood. Less than a month later, his father suffered the same fate.\n\nNour was taken into the care of his brother, before he too was killed a year later. He was left with two sisters, but they were soon married and unable to care for him. He was on his way to an orphanage when a cousin stepped in to bring him to Lebanon.\n\nNour\u2019s love of school kept him going. He was a good student in Syria, and desperately wanted to carry on studying in Lebanon, but as soon as he arrived he was put to work in his cousin\u2019s dairy factory.\n\n\u201cI didn't have any free time for myself. I wanted to study English but I didn\u2019t even have time to read a book. My cousin wouldn't let me study,\u201d he says.\n\nThe same is true of many Syrian children. According to the United Nations children\u2019s charity, the average monthly income of refugee families in the Bekaa Valley is around $50 (\u00a341), while their expenses are close to $120. The result is that many children are sent to work to make up the difference.\n\nNour was still going to school while working for his cousin, but his job was getting in the way.\n\n\u201cLiving with him was really hard part in my life. I was suffering so much. That's why I decided to leave him and live on my own,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, at 15-years-old, a refugee in a country where most Syrians were struggling to survive, he moved into a one-room apartment on his own. He found a job painting houses, and on the weekend he worked in a restaurant chopping fruit.\n\n\u201cIt was the worst place I have ever lived. It didn't have a door even,\u201d he says. \u201cI was doing everything myself. Cooking, cleaning, and studying. I worked during my time off to support myself. I was only thinking about surviving.\u201d\n\nThere were other difficulties, too, not unique to Nour's life. Eight years into Syria\u2019s devastating civil war, more than a million refugees remain stuck in limbo here, too afraid to return home to a country still stricken by conflict, where forced conscription and arbitrary arrests are commonplace.\n\nLebanon was praised early on for its hospitality to Syrians, but as the war dragged on, pressure has increased for them to leave. Evictions and army raids on refugee camps are on the rise, towns have introduced curfews specifically for Syrians, ministers and politicians have made repeated calls for them to go home.\n\nA worsening Lebanese economy only added to these tensions. Nour felt that undercurrent of anger.\n\n\u201cI love Lebanon, but Lebanon doesn't love me,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a Syrian in the Lebanese society is really hard. Even though you have really close friends, you can't erase from his mind the idea that I'm a Syrian and you're a Lebanese.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had friends for more than five years and sometimes they something so racist to me, they really hurt me. Even though I was so integrated, they will still treat you like a foreigner.\u201d\n\nNour did more than survive. In his high school exams, he achieved the 28th highest marks in the entire country.\n\nCharity workers started to take notice. He began receiving some assistance from Save the Children to help him stay in school. In 2018, he was visited by its then CEO, the former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The meeting would have a profound impact on the course of his life.\n\n\u201cShe came to my house and she suggested that I apply to a boarding school. I had no idea what a boarding school was,\u201d he says. \u201cShe wrote the name of it on a piece of paper and a few months later I applied.\u201d\n\nThe boarding school, which The Independent is not naming to protect Nour\u2019s anonymity, offered a scholarship for refugees \u2014 but competition for the place was fierce. What followed gruelling process of online tests and interviews.\n\n\u201cAfter the first interview I said I don't care. I didn't think it would go any further. When I realised that things were getting more serious, I started to think about it more and more.\u201d\n\nHe waited and waited for news. When the day finally came, it was the worst possible timing. He was due to take three exams and he couldn\u2019t keep his mind off what could be the biggest decision of his life.\n\n\"I woke up at 5am I looked at my phone and found nothing. I thought \u2018oh my God, I have been rejected.\u2019 Then I remembered that the Wifi was turned off. I turned it on and I found the email.\u201d\n\n\u201cI started shouting. I didn't want to go to school to do the exams. I was writing and I was so sleepy. I couldn't concentrate. I wanted to go home. I wanted to dance.\u201d\n\nWhile Nour\u2019s story has a happy ending, there are some 2.5 million Syrian children scattered across the region who have little hope of following in his footsteps.\n\n\u201cNour\u2019s story illustrates how important education is for children. He fought against all odds to make it to the UK, and while we supported him throughout his application process, he did it by himself thanks to his remarkable will and high grades,\u201d says Allison Zelkowitz, Save the Children\u2019s country director in Lebanon.\n\n\u201cBut resettlement of Syrian refugees in countries outside of the region has decreased. The UK can play a key role to ensure that more resettlement places are accessible and increase access to other pathways for refugees, such as students visas. Supporting learning can be a lifeline to some of the highest performing Syrian refugees\u201d.\n\nIt would be a nervous few months while he made preparations for his new life. There were still so many things that could go wrong. It is not uncommon for Syrians to be detained at Beirut\u2019s airport for bureaucratic infractions and there was always the chance that he could face problems on the other end, in the UK.\n\nAs he sits beside his packed bags in his apartment, Nour is a bundle of excitement. He is fascinated with aviation, and airports especially, and has spent the last few weeks studying the layout of Heathrow Terminal 5, where he is due to land.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a clear idea of what he wants to do after school, only that he wants to tell his story to as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cAll I know about what I want to be in the future is that want to express all my opinions. When I was a kid I felt I was restricted by what I could say. I want to share my story. I don't want to be in one place. I want to move,\u201d he says.\n\n*Nour arrived in the UK this week and is now getting ready to start the school term.", "description": "There were many times throughout his life when 17-year-old Nour could have become just another grim statistic. The numbers were always against him. He was a young boy when the Syrian war began, and when his hometown of Moadamyeh was bombed and besieged by government forces. He could have easily become one of the more than 4,859 children who have been killed in Syria.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/19/ch1371283-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
