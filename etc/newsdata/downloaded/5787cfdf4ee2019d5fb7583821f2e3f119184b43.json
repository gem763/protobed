The benefits that will be derived from the production of industrial hemp are enormous and varied,\" he said.\n\nZimbabwe legalised the production of cannabis for medicinal or scientific use last year. But it was only in September that the government legalised production of cannabis for industrial use.\n\nUnlike marijuana, hemp contains a low count of psychoactive substance THC, while the plant requires minimal care and is adaptable to grow in most climates.\n\nIt can be processed into various products including cloth, ropes, bricks, paper and fibreglass.\n\nThe Harare-based ZIHT was the first organisation to be issued with a cannabis licence in the southern African country.\n\nThe company's founder, dentist Zorodzai Maroveke, said she discovered the opportunities in cannabis production when she bought a dress made from hemp fabric while studying in China.\n\nThe health ministry grants growers licences valid for up to five years, but they are limited to strict cultivation conditions.\n\nAlthough cannabis use was previously illegal in Zimbabwe, it is widely used in traditional medicine to treat conditions like asthma and epilepsy.\n\nPossession of recreational cannabis remains illegal and carries a jail sentence of up to 12 years.", "description": "A Zimbabwean company planted the country's first authorised hemp crop on Friday at a prison in the capital Harare after the production of industrial cannabis was legalised last month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9189/1f983546c17441f49eea72ae9c21aef3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
