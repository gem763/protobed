We take a look.\n\nFAST CARS IN SLOW TRAFFIC\n\nPlenty is made of the myriad qualities of Liverpool's attacking trio of Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino.\n\nThat's little surprise when the three have already scored 17 goals between them in the opening two months of the season.\n\nThe speed and intelligence of their passing and movement, plus the interchangeability of their positioning, causes dizziness to any defence, let alone one so vulnerable as United's.\n\nHowever, when the sides played out a goalless draw at Old Trafford back in February, United did find a way in highly unusual and tricky circumstances to not only hold Liverpool goalless but restrict them to just one shot on target.\n\nLiverpool's fearsome front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane\n\nJordan Henderson cuts a frustrated figure during the teams' goalless draw back in February\n\nAfter their attack, which had been firing on all cylinders during Solskjaer's temporary spell as manager, was blunted by the freakish scenario of first-half injuries to Ander Herrera, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard, United adapted.\n\nThey settled into a 4-3-1-2 formation and simply frustrated Liverpool's front line instead. It was more of a Jose Mourinho tactic but it proved effective on the day and stopped Liverpool going three points clear at the top.\n\nGiven that United are so brittle of confidence and really cannot afford another defeat, Solskjaer may well be tempted to start with this blocking tactic on Sunday.\n\nIn placing what was essentially a flat line of six across the edge of their penalty box, United succeeded in starving Salah, Firmino and Mane of any space in which to do their thing.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum is crowded out by Jesse Lingard and Scott McTominay at Old Trafford\n\nVictor Lindelof (left), Harry Maguire (middle) and Nemanja Matic need to be disciplined\n\nEvery time one of them received the ball, they'd be surrounded by two or three red shirts, with Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay deployed in defensive roles ahead of Victor Lindelof and Chris Smalling.\n\nEach Liverpool attack crumbled on the edge of the United box and, while it goes against their instincts and threatens to bore the fans, it wouldn't be surprising to see the trick repeated.\n\nGHOSTBUSTING ON THE EDGE OF THE BOX\n\nUnited have had a real problem this season with picking up opposition players who have 'ghosted' to the edge of their box and not been picked up.\n\nRuben Neves curled home from 20 yards following a right-side cut-back in the 1-1 draw at Molineux in August and Newcastle's Matty Longstaff drilled home from a similar position to give Newcastle three points a fortnight ago.\n\nGiven the strength of Liverpool out wide because of their attack-minded, overlapping wing-backs Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, we are going to see plenty of cut-backs in search of Firmino or one of their midfielders.\n\nDespite the attentions of four United players, Ruben Neves (right) was able to score from the edge of the box during the 1-1 draw at Wolves back in August\n\nUnited have the advantage of McTominay and Nemanja Matic, set to play in the continued injury absence of Pogba, being more deep-lying so they should be in the right areas just outside the box.\n\nBut they need to remain alert. McTominay wasn't when Longstaff scored at St James' Park and no fewer than four out-rushing United players failed to stop Neves picking out the top corner.\n\nIt's certainly an area Liverpool will look to exploit so United need to be disciplined, with Maguire taking responsibility for positioning his colleagues when Liverpool attack.\n\nMatty Longstaff was allowed plenty of room to drill home Newcastle's winner two weeks ago\n\nAshley Young might be targeted as the weak link by Liverpool down the right flank on Sunday\n\nIn terms of those in wider positions, you fear the worst for United if the speedy Mane takes on 34-year-old Ashley Young with Alexander-Arnold overlapping him.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka, just back from illness, should be better equipped to cope with whoever is on his flank but it won't take long to find out who Liverpool are targeting if Young starts on the opposite side.\n\nLOOSENING THE NOOSE OF THE HIGH PRESS\n\nKlopp's Liverpool are famous for their high press, setting those traps high up the field in order to snatch back possession as quickly as possible.\n\nThe midfielders like Georginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson will push forward, Salah and Mane will mark the wing-backs and Firmino will loiter in the middle for the quick pass to hoover up the scraps.\n\nThey will seek to exploit United's nervousness and sluggishness when passing the ball, something that has been evident in far too many of their games this season.\n\nSergio Romero is likely to play in goal for Manchester United on Sunday after De Gea's injury\n\nOne option would be for Sergio Romero, likely to deputise for the injured David De Gea, to just bypass it with long kicks and try to utilise the speed of Marcus Rashford, Daniel James and Anthony Martial in behind.\n\nTo be honest, given United's skittishness against even modest opposition this season, this would be far preferable than attempting to play out from the back and losing possession 30 yards from their own goal.\n\nA TEAM IN TRANSITION... IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY\n\nIt's time to stress test the theory that United are far better playing against teams that attack them than ones who sit back and defend.\n\nTheir most notable wins this season so far have been the 4-0 thrashing of Chelsea on the opening weekend of the season and the 1-0 home success over Leicester.\n\nOn both occasions, the opposition came to Old Trafford, weren't afraid to commit players forward and were picked open by a United quick in transition on the counter-attack.\n\nMarcus Rashford celebrates during United's demolition of Chelsea on the opening weekend\n\nLiverpool certainly won't hesitate in pushing forward this Sunday and Solskjaer believes it will play into United's hands.\n\n'Sometimes we've struggled more in games where we've had to break teams down,' he told Sky Sports this week.\n\n'We've had 75 or 80 per cent possession in games and we haven't been able to create the big chances.\n\n'The Chelsea and Leicester games at home were 50-50 possession, and we've had more spaces to attack into.\n\n'I can't see Liverpool coming to park the bus \u2013 that's just not in their mentality. So I can see it being an open game, which will suit us.'\n\nUnited need to be quick in transition to spring Rashford and Anthony Martial (left) into space\n\nIt's certainly true that United have looked pretty clueless when confronted with packed opposition ranks this season, all sideways passing and pedestrian build-up.\n\nThey will hope Liverpool's attacking opens up spaces they can exploit with the speed of their forward line but it depends on how quickly they can transition from defence to attack.\n\nIt would be beneficial for Solskjaer to show the players a tape of the Chelsea win when Rashford, Martial et al tore the Blues to shreds, especially in the second-half.", "description": "It's doubtful there has been any fixture between Liverpool and Manchester United since the late 1980s with the prospects so heavily stacked in favour of the Merseyside club.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/19/19934234-0-image-a-9_1571511520985.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
