James frequently talks about \"Taco Tuesday\" on social media, sharing videos of moments where his family was readying to devour tacos\u2026yes that is right\u2026on a Tuesday.\n\nWhile James loves his tacos on Tuesday, a trademark of the popular phrase was a bridge too far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnder [United States] trademark law, if a phrase is commonly used in everyday speech, the phrase is then unable to be registered as a trademark,\u201d patent and trademark attorney Josh Gerben told FOX Business. \u201cAt this point, Lebron's company could appeal the refusal. That said, this type of refusal is extremely difficult to overcome. It is very likely that this application will now just abandon.\u201d\n\nAccording to the application from James\u2019 company, LBJ Trademarks, the phrase was going to be used for \u201cOnline entertainment services, namely, providing a website featuring non-downloadable videos, and social media posts in the field of sports, entertainment, current events and popular culture.\u201d\n\nBut it turns out the denial might have in fact been a victory for James.\n\n\"Finding 'Taco Tuesday' as commonplace achieves precisely what the intended outcome was, which was getting the U.S. government to recognize that someone cannot be sued for its use,\" a spokesman for James told ESPN.\n\n\"Taco Tuesday\" has been popular for decades and has become part of the vernacular for many Americans.\n\nTaco John\u2019s, a restaurant chain in the Midwest, trademarked the phrase in 1979. The company, with over 400 locations, has been vigilant in pursuing the use of \"Taco Tuesday\" with hundreds of cease-and-desist orders since the trademark was approved.\n\nIt appears that James wanted to utilize the phrase of \"Taco Tuesday\" for his podcast and other online ventures, not to necessarily sell tacos.\n\n\u201cI think it is important to note that Lebron can still call his internet show 'Taco Tuesday.' This USPTO decision blocks his ability to register the phrase as a trademark,\u201d Gerben said. \u201cIt does not affect his ability to use the phrase.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "LeBron James faces an uphill battle to trademark 'Taco Tuesday' after his application was denied this week.
