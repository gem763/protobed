Hong Kong Free Press reported Saturday a large demonstration brawled with democracy protesters at a Kowloon Bay mall while also damaging pro-democracy placards set up across the island. RTHK confirmed the clashes between the two groups before police officers became involved.\n\nThe caveat is who it appeared HKPD targeted. RTHK reported officers were accused of being lenient towards pro-Beijing advocates while only arresting anti-extradition bill demonstrators. Stand News, which is pro-democracy, supported the report and noted officers pushed a photojournalist out of the way and into a wall.\n\nA pro-China protester was also injured after police left the area. RTHK reported the attack happened because he was spotted taking pictures of anti-government protesters. There\u2019s no defense of violence but it\u2019s likely there was fear he was an undercover cop sent to blend in with those who are against the government. The anxiety is understandable given the fact protesters have been arrested by police at their homes. It doesn\u2019t justify the violence but provides a bit of a lens into a possible motive.\n\nViolence broke out again today as demonstrators clogged the streets near the Hong Kong government offices in support of International Democracy Day. The march was originally canceled by police but thousands showed up anyway.\n\n\u201cEven though the police rejected our march today we will still come out because it is our right to do it,\u201d a registered nurse called \u2018Ms. Chow\u2019 by Hong Kong Free Press stated while holding a sign vowing protesters would not surrender to Hong Kong. \u201cI think the majority of Hong Kong people are not afraid of coming out.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment was shared by others taking part in the gathering.\n\n\u201cThis is the first rally since the withdrawal of the extradition bill,\u201d protester Terence Pang told South China Morning Post while he sat in a wheelchair. \u201cThat\u2019s important because we need to let the government know that our other demands have not been met. I\u2019m most concerned about having universal suffrage \u2013 that\u2019s the root of all our problems.\u201d\n\nHow the violence started is up for debate. South China Morning Post put the blame for the clashes on what they called \u201cradical protesters\u201d writing the group lobbed Molotov cocktails at police before they were struck with tear gas and rubber bullets. Hong Kong Free Press seemed to suggest the bombs and tear gas happened almost simultaneously. The truth may be somewhere in between.\n\nWhat happened next isn\u2019t debatable. Bricks and rubber bullets flew through the air as the pitched battle began between both sides. Police used water cannons and tear gas and HKFP reported some journalists ended up being struck by a tear gas canister. There are multiple reports one police water cannon truck was hit by a Molotov cocktail although no injuries were reported.\n\nOne curious thing is why pro-democracy demonstrators claim to be using petrol bombs. One person told RTHK they didn\u2019t want to hurt officers but just keep them away from gatherings. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are trying to aim for the police or anyone, they just throw it in the stairs.\u201d the 21-year-old claimed. \u201cGive us some time to retreat or something.\u201d\n\nThe night brought about more fights and arrests. Police took Democratic Party legislator Ted Hui into custody on claims he obstructed their operations. The crime? Telling officers to not abuse their power when they arrested a couple in black shirts walking in the streets. The female in the couple told officers she was just going home but police said she\u2019d been yelling. Odd reasons for an arrest.\n\nJournalists were also assaulted. SCMP reported two of their reporters were attacked by men wearing white. One female Apple Daily reporter suffered a hand injury when a white-clad man tried to take her phone. RTHK reported later the white-clad gang, for lack of a better term, went after anti-government demonstrators all while police watched and did nothing. A witness to a separate brawl claimed police broke up the fight but did not arrest any of the white-clad attackers.\n\nThe common refrain of observers of the Hong Kong situation is the island is headed towards destruction. George Will wrote in his syndicated column this weekend he believes China and the Hong Kong government made an error in judgment by not withdrawing the extradition bill immediately after the protests broke out. One Civic Party leader told Will some protesters carry their will in case the police kill them.\n\nIt would be too easy to blame the hardline protesters for not backing down with their demands. They seek five things: kill the extradition bill, drop all charges against protesters, classify the demonstrations as \u201cprotests,\u201d not riots, look into possible police brutality, and universal suffrage. The extradition bill is dead, thankfully, while the other four demands aren\u2019t necessarily untenable. Universal suffrage will take the longest to attain although it\u2019s still a worthy goal for the future.\n\nHong Kong burns. It can still be saved if everyone is willing.
