The journey involves an awkward encounter with US Customs & Border Protection in LA, and takes three hours longer than the Heathrow-Singapore-Auckland route.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But it faces direct competition with American Airlines, British Airways, United and Virgin Atlantic, as well as Norwegian from Gatwick.\n\nThe route will cease in October 2020, at the end of the summer season.\n\nAir New Zealand employs around 130 London-based staff, mainly cabin crew. The UK base will be closed, with the airline hoping to find alternative posts for the employees. The airline is expected to sell its daily slot pair at Heathrow for between \u00a310m and \u00a320m.\n\nAt the same time, Air New Zealand will begin nonstop flights between Auckland and New York. The 8,810-mile journey to and from Newark airport will be flown with a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, the same aircraft that Qantas uses between London and Perth.\n\nMr McDowall said: \u201cWe expect North America to continue to be New Zealand\u2019s fastest growing visitor market. This network reset puts us in the best position to take advantage of this while opening up the Big Apple for our customers.\u201d\n\nMost of the route is across the Pacific. The direct track from Auckland make landfall in North America at the southern tip of Baja California, crossing northern Mexico, Texas and the southern states of the US. It will be scheduled for 15h 40m eastbound, 17h 40m westbound.\n\nThe new service will enable British travellers to combine New York and New Zealand with a ticket on the Star Alliance carriers Air New Zealand and United.\n\nAt the weekend, Qantas made a test flight on the 9,950-mile link between Sydney and New York.", "description": "After 38 years linking London with Auckland via Los Angeles, Air New Zealand is to end its only route to and from Europe \u2013 and, at the same time, launch a non-stop from its hub to New York.
