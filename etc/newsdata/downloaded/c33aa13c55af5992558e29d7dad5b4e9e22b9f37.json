Lil Nas X invited the Charlotte rapper onto his single \u201cPanini\u201d from his new-ish EP, 7. After four remixes of \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d Lil Nas X pivoted to \u201cPanini\u201d and dropped a new version with a fresh verse from DaBaby. It wouldn\u2019t be a Lil Nas X remix if it didn\u2019t come with some sort of visual, but instead of a horse covered in $100 bills, the \u201cPanini\u201d remix got an entire music video animated to look like the old Cartoon Network show, Chowder. (The song is named after a bunny character.)\n\nRemixes are all over the Billboard Hot 100. Lizzo\u2019s \u201cTruth Hurts,\u201d which proudly sits at No. 1, got a remix with DaBaby earlier this summer. No. 2, Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cbad guy,\u201d has a remixed version with Justin Bieber. Then, of course, there\u2019s No. 5, \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d which broke the mold and \u201cPanini,\u201d down at No. 29, which wants the boost. Who\u2019s next? \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d remix?", "description": "DaBaby hopped onto Lil Nas X\u2019s song \u2018Panini\u2019 and they dropped a \u2018Chowder\u2019-themed music video to go with it.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-dababy-lil-nas-x.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
