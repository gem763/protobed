He\u2019ll also appear before the House committee on transportation on Wednesday.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with family members who were in the closed-door meeting. They said that the meeting, at times \u201ctense\u201d and \u201cemotional,\u201d covered a range of topics including Boeing\u2019s efforts to fix the troubled system that led to the two crashes.\n\nVisit Business Insider\u2019s homepage for more stories.\n\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met on Tuesday with more than a dozen family members of victims killed in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the second of two fatal 737 Max crashes that led to a worldwide grounding of the plane type.\n\nThe meeting between the family members \u2013 who have largely assumed roles as aviation safety advocates in the wake of the crash \u2013 and Muilenburg came after the executive spent more than two hours testifying in front of a Senate Commerce Committee hearing.\n\nDuring the hearing \u2013 which came a year to the day after the first crash, Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia \u2013 Muilenburg admitted that Boeing had made mistakes, and expressed sympathy for the victims. However, the sympathy left some family members sitting in the gallery feeling put out \u2013 they felt it was performative, made for the cameras, rather than them.\n\n\u201cIt was a good show, but his back was to us, and he never looked at us,\u201d Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya Stumo was killed in the Ethiopian crash, told Business Insider.\n\nSamya\u2019s mother expressed similar frustrations at the end of the hearing itself, as Muilenburg exited the chamber. \u201cTurn around and look at people when you say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d she said, prompting Muilenburg to turn and meet her eye before saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nDuring the private meeting with family members later in the afternoon, Muilenburg offered an apology that Stumo characterised as more satisfactory and appropriate.\n\n\u201cHe did his best to remedy that, talking with all of us privately in that meeting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe meeting, which took place at the Cannon House Office Building, began with a rearranging of chairs, according to Stumo. When families arrived early for the meeting, they found the conference room arranged \u201ctheatre-style, or classroom-style,\u201d Stumo said, with a table up front for Muilenburg and chairs throughout the room facing it.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t need to be sitting and listening to him like that,\u201d Stumo said, \u201cso we immediately went arranged the chairs in a circle.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg arrived shortly after.\n\n\u201cHe came in and greeted everyone,\u201d Chris Moore, whose daughter Danielle was also killed in the second crash, said. \u201cHe walked around the room, and everyone had a chance to tell him about their loved ones and how important they were, so he could understand the human perspective.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was originally supposed to be a half-hour, but ended up lasting more than an hour and 20 minutes, Stumo said.\n\nAt times, things were tense.\n\n\u201cIt was quite heated at some times,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a lot of anger that we have directed at Boeing, and he took it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was tense, it was emotional,\u201d Stumo added. \u201cThere was a lot of anger at him for their actions and inactions.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg and the families, many of whom have become well-versed in the technical aspects of the 737 Max\u2019s flaws, discussed a range of topics, including why the plane wasn\u2019t grounded after the first crash, and what Boeing is doing to get it cleared to fly again.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that everyone gets it right this time so there\u2019s no third crash,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about whether it\u2019s safe; it\u2019s about how we can know it\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe said we\u2019d trust what Boeing is doing if they disclose the Max fixes publicly, so we and third-party experts can validate that it\u2019s safe, not just the FAA,\u201d Stumo said. \u201cHe said he would work to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Boeing wants to build public trust, let public validation occur.\u201d\n\nWhile both Stumo and Moore said that the meeting was a positive step, it wasn\u2019t enough to assure them that all will be well \u2013 nor that the accountability they have sought will be handed out.\n\n\u201cHe should resign,\u201d Stumo said. \u201cBoeing can change internal personnel or structure, but they need to be more supportive of regulatory changes, too, with a safety culture insulated from the profit culture.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg is scheduled to testify before a House transportation committee panel on Wednesday.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
