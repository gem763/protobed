(Lola Gomez/Austin American-Statesman via AP) More\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan is to drum up public pressure, beginning on debate day, on banks and credit card companies to refuse to handle any transaction involving assault weapons and firearm sales without a background check, most often found online and at gun shows.\n\nAdditionally, he is calling on these financial institutions to deny services to all gun and ammunition manufacturers that produce or sell assault weapons. This call appears to be the first of its kind among the Democratic candidates.\n\n(MORE: What to watch for in ABC News' Democratic presidential debate )\n\nThe Texas-native, who narrowly lost a 2018 for a Texas U.S. Senate race seat, has maneuvered himself to the forefront of the more than 20 Democratic candidates on the gun violence issue since an attack by a gunman inside a Walmart killed 22 people in his hometown of El Paso on Aug. 3.\n\nO\u2019Rourke suspended his campaign operations then and returned to the trail nearly two weeks later as the first candidate to call for a mandatory government buyback of every assault weapon in the United States. A September ABC News/Washington Post poll shows 52 percent of Americans support such a program.\n\nPHOTO: Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke speaks during a rally against the visit of President Donald Trump after a shooting at a Walmart store, in El Paso, Texas, Aug. 7, 2019.

Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell their assault weapons.
