At least, that's how flex office providers describe the public perception of the industry.\n\nWhen WeWork was valued at $47 billion in its a SoftBank-rolled fundraising round and expanding into education and residential real estate, the association was welcomed, and competitors themselves have been benefiting from hefty venture funding.\n\nBut now WeWork has shelved its IPO after contemplating drastic valuation cuts to make it more palatable to investors, and CEO Adam Neumann has said he is 'humbled' by the company's collapsing valuation, according to media reports.\n\nAhead of news that WeWork was postponing its IPO, Business Insider spoke to executives at four coworking providers about their reactions to WeWork's suddenly unsustainable-seeming valuation.\n\nThe execs have been quick to point out differences between their business and WeWork's, though they highlighted WeWork's role as a growth driver in the flex-office space. Several also blamed a frothy news cycle for casting doubt on the industry. The most common argument? WeWork doesn't stand for the entire space.\n\nAll of these competitors are substantially smaller than WeWork. Knotel, which raised $400 million in a funding round last month, is the closest to catching up to WeWork's $1.7 billion Series G round. WeWork is the largest tenant in New York City, and only competes with much-older Regus in global square footage. WeWork is also looking to push its business towards asset-light management deals, similar to some of the competitors quoted in this article.", "description": "Flex-office execs say negative press around WeWork could have effects on their businesses, but argue criticism of the broad industry is unwarranted.", "authors": ["Alex Nicoll", "Meghan Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
