We all deserve health care and access to higher education, an economy where we all can thrive, not just the top one percent and a transformative foreign policy, one that is centered on peace and diplomacy,\" Sarsour told a crowd. \"A foreign policy that sees Palestinians as human beings deserving of human rights and self-determination.\"\n\n\"Bernie doesn't ask us how much these things will cost because only people don't believe we deserve these things will ask us how to pay for things like health care, but never ask us how to pay for endless and unjust wars,\" she explained.\n\nIt's rather ironic that Bernie, a Jewish man, is having an anti-Semite as a campaign surrogate. Maybe he forgot that Sarsour has deep ties to Louis Farrakhan. Not to mention that she agreed with Rep. Ilhan Omar's assessment that people have \"dual loyalty\" if they want to protect Israel. Or maybe the campaign was unaware that Sarsour influenced Democratic leadership to change their anti-Semitism resolution so it was more broadly focused.\n\nEither way, Sarsour has advocated for policies that deeply hurt the Jewish people \u2013 Bernie included. The fact that he's using her to advance his campaign is disgusting.", "description": "Geez..09/09/2019 22:17:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/26/0a1071be-2d69-4671-b720-0d9afb2267b1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
