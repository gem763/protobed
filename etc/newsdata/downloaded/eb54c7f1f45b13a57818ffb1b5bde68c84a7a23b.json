If you have employer-sponsored insurance, you'll soon be seeing those emails asking you to review your benefits. And if you have your own coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace, which includes Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) plans, open enrollment begins November 1st and closes December 15th.\n\nBut before you automatically choose the same plan, or choose a new plan too quickly, know that your selection can affect your finances, especially since healthcare costs are rising.\n\nFor instance, large employers predicted that the total cost of covering health insurance for workers and their families would average $15,375 per person in 2020 \u2014 an increase of 5%, according to a 2019 survey by the National Business Group on Health. And that can affect how much workers pay.\n\nSince medical bills are a leading cause of personal bankruptcy, ideally you can find a plan that works for you.\n\nYou may want to consider these four points (and any others for your situation), whether you're choosing an employer-sponsored plan, applying via the marketplace, or considering joining your partner's plan.\n\nLook beyond the monthly premium\n\nA low monthly premium isn't necessarily the best predictor of a plan's ultimate cost.\n\nFor instance, if the premium is low but the deductible (the amount you pay before the plan starts to pay expenses) is high, out-of-pocket costs may be more than you'd think. And with 58% of Americans having less than $1,000 in a savings account, according to one survey, these costs could put you in a financial pit.\n\nThe bottom line: Review the summary of benefits and consider the entire plan \u2014 including coverage for things like lab tests, prescriptions, and hospitalizations \u2014 and any deductible. Then evaluate costs overall.\n\nThink about your health and lifestyle\n\nHave you been putting off a surgery or some other health visit? See if a plan change can help.\n\n\"The first thing that I would do is make a list of all the things you're going to need for the next year,\" advises Brian Zimmerman, owner of BZI Group, an independent investment and insurance firm in Deptford, New Jersey.\n\nSince insurance plans can have limits (say, for the number of physical therapy visits), read the fine print. If you need dental or vision coverage, find out if they're covered.\n\nAnd for you adventurous types: If you're planning to try active sports or some other high-intensity activity, think ahead, says Alexandra Wilson, CFP and financial coach at SmartPath in Atlanta.\n\nEven if you're not planning to need health care, she adds, consider your \"lifestyle and lifestyle changes and how that could impact your needs.\" If you can find a plan that covers more of your needs, that could mean less money out-of-pocket if an accident or health issue happens.\n\nConsider your family size and life changes\n\nAre you planning to expand your family? Is it even a possibility? Examine your plan. The average cost to have a baby can run into the thousands, and health insurance can vary in how much of the costs you'd share.\n\nConsider reviewing your options (including those that your partner may have) and decide which plan best suits your situation.\n\nIf you have older children, you also can evaluate plans to see which has the best coverage for your needs. Even if you have an employer-sponsored plan, if you're paying for a spouse and children, this can get expensive, notes Zimmerman. \"If that's the case, you should definitely shop around to see if there's better coverage for less money,\" he advises.\n\nReview your providers\n\nInsurance won't help if your providers don't accept it. So if you have a favorite or critical provider, or if you (or anyone covered by the plan) has been referred to someone new, check on whether that provider participates with your plan.\n\nConsider your income\n\nIf your income has decreased, or will, check to see if you'll be eligible for Medicaid, which can have nominal cost-sharing for services, or a tax credit or other savings through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Visit healthcare.gov to learn more.\n\nAlso, if you have certain disabilities or will be age 65 or older, you may want to see if you'll be eligible for Medicare. That said, in general, if you ever have a life-changing event (like a marriage or divorce, having a baby, or losing health coverage), you can apply for benefits outside of open enrollment.", "description": "Your insurance selection can affect your finances, so looking at your plan every year is important \u2014 and can save you money.", "authors": ["Leslie Quander Wooldridge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9cdfbdee01920702bd789?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
