His campaign is focusing on getting corporate money out of U.S. politics.\n\nHe has worked for years on climate change and voter engagement and donated about $170 million since 2015 to his independent political action committees, Need to Impeach and NextGen America.\n\nDuring the 2017-2018 election cycle, he was the second-largest donor to Democratic and liberal candidates and causes, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nSteyer did not qualify for the third debate, which will take place in Houston this week with the top 10 candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "The 62-year-old former hedge fund manager from San Francisco, who is not well-known beyond political circles, will be one of 11 candidates who has met the Democratic National Committee's minimum requirements to participate in the Ohio debate on Oct. 15-16.  \"It\u2019s now more clear than ever that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w9MOtkGNMBgIvb7J9OxifQ--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/3f8b76f522b65539267170b66688b98f", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
