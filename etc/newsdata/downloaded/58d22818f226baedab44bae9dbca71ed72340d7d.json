His defence that he \u201cgave a peck on the lips to boost her confidence\u201d after she had been called \u201ca fat lass\u201d by other passengers might have played well with the jury, but it raises questions about what constitutes acceptable behaviour on public transport.\n\nThe woman concerned said that Gascoigne had tried to sit on her lap, grabbed her face and kissed her full on the lips, \u201ccompletely out of the blue\u201d. Gascoigne\u2019s lawyer said that his client might have kissed a woman who \u201cdidn\u2019t like it\u201d, but that didn\u2019t make him a sex offender.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He\u2019s clearly a man with issues, who has struggled with alcoholism, but that doesn\u2019t excuse revolting behaviour. He was also found not guilty on a lesser charge of assault by beating.\n\nHow can he walk out of court smiling and celebrating a \u201cvictory\u201d when his behaviour must have been thoroughly unpleasant, for one person at least?", "description": "Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been found not guilty on charges of sexual assault,\u00a0after kissing a woman he encountered on a train last August.
