It is: \u2018Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney replied. \u201cWe were holding up money at the same time for uh, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries so that they would change their policies on immigration.\u201d\n\nLater, responding to broad concerns about \u201cpolitical influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney said: \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump last month, weeks after a whistleblower in the intelligence community alleged that Trump called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his rivals in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nRead: Maybe Rudy Giuliani Should Hire a Lawyer\n\n\n\nThe White House has consistently denied that it engaged in a quid pro quo, even making that a specific talking point it shopped around to Republicans in Congress in the aftermath of the revelations.\n\n\u201cNo pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!\u201d Trump said on Twitter of his communications with Zelensky last month.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) told VICE News of the press conference, \"Mulvaney apparently decided it was OK to admit to an impeachable offense.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the textbook definition of an impeachable offense, and the White House chief of staff has just admitted it,\u201d Neal Katyal, the former acting solicitor general, tweeted Thursday.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s surprising candor comes hours after Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland testified before Congress that Trump told U.S. diplomats to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine policy \u2014 and that Rudy said Trump wanted investigations.\n\nSondland\u2019s testimony was only the latest damaging revelation to come from within Trump\u2019s own administration. Earlier this week, Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser described a State Department overtaken by Giuliani\u2019s shadow diplomacy campaign. Trump\u2019s former National Security Adviser, John Bolton, who resigned in September, called the Ukraine scheme a \u201cdrug deal,\u201d and reportedly referred to Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nGreg Walters and Cameron Joseph contributed reporting.\n\nCover: White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announces that the G7 will be held at Trump National Doral, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in Washington.
