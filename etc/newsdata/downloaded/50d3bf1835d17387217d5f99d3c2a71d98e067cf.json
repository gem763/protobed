As for David Cameron... | David Mitchell", "language": "en", "text": "Like most people, I enjoyed the news of the theft of that gold toilet. I\u2019m glad the gold toilet exists (or existed) and I\u2019m glad it was stolen. After all, if it hadn\u2019t been stolen, I probably wouldn\u2019t know it exists. I\u2019m also glad it was stolen from Blenheim Palace, that colossally vulgar stately home, because it\u2019s exactly the kind of place you imagine might have gold toilets.\n\nIt only slightly spoils it that it doesn\u2019t. The loos at Blenheim are, as far as I know, made from conventional materials. The gold loo, as well as being a loo, is a work of conceptual art and was part of an exhibition of other works of art that weren\u2019t also loos, or also gold. So the gold loo wasn\u2019t already there. Winston Churchill never s(h)at on it, though he was born just across the hall. On a non-gold bed, I regret to say.\n\nBut it\u2019s a proper loo. It\u2019s not just loo-shaped, it was a working loo before the burglars ripped it out. Visitors were each offered a three-minute go on it, which I reckon is rushing it for a poo (and a poo is obviously what most people would want to do in a gold loo \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s the anecdote), but plenty of time for a wee, the yellowness of which would presumably be hard to discern. A poo would show up brilliantly though and definitely be all sorts of metaphors.\n\nAgain, slightly spoiling it, the artist, Maurizio Cattelan, is ahead of us here. He offered the loo to Donald Trump and he\u2019s called it America. So, you know, he\u2019s doing the joke. And Donald Trump turned it down, which suggests even that idiot senses ribaldry because there\u2019s no doubt that, stripped of the potential metaphorical implications, he would definitely like to have a gold loo. Interior design by King Midas is absolutely Trump\u2019s domestic style and his penthouse is probably the only place on Earth more likely than Blenheim Palace to have a solid gold khazi.\n\nI hope whoever stole the golden loo gets away with it. It just seems fun, like an Ealing comedy\n\nBut it\u2019s still a great story, made more so by the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, and the current Duke of Marlborough\u2019s half-brother, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, having said of the loo last month: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the easiest thing to nick.\u201d True \u2013 that would probably be a pen from a meeting or a Twix from a newsagent. But traditionally thieves are willing to make a bit more of an effort for things that are made of solid, 18-carat gold.\n\n\u201cFirstly, it\u2019s plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate,\u201d Lord Edward continued. \u201cSo no, I don\u2019t plan to be guarding it.\u201d I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d be the man for the job anyway. Get some sort of professional security would be my advice. And I\u2019m not entirely clear why the thieves would need to know the identity or diet of the lavatory\u2019s previous occupant or why ignorance of those things would deter them. Does he just mean that no one would want to pinch all that gold because it might have poo and wee on it? Where there\u2019s muck there\u2019s brass, your lordship.\n\nI can\u2019t help wishing the thieves luck. At the time of writing, two people have been arrested, but there\u2019s still no sign of the missing bog and I hope whoever did it gets away with it. There\u2019s not much harm in that, is there? It doesn\u2019t make me an anarchist. It just seems fun, like an Ealing comedy. I reckon I\u2019d probably always have felt like that about it.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced, though. Another story made me doubt myself. This was last week\u2019s news that McDonald\u2019s has applied for planning permission to open a branch in Rutland, the only county in Britain that doesn\u2019t yet have one. Unsurprisingly, some Rutlanders are up in arms at the prospect.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this to our beautiful county. Let\u2019s stay the only county without one of these,\u201d implored resident Charnelle Els, while Joanna Aitkens told the council: \u201cI\u2019ve heard that it would bring Rutland into the 21st century. I\u2019m sure that even McDonald\u2019s would think that it\u2019s a sad world that pins its hopes on a cheap burger and fries to offer modernity and prosperity to a county.\u201d If McDonald\u2019s does think that, it\u2019s sliding into corporate self-loathing. Meanwhile, David Taylor said: \u201cIt will be an eyesore and attract the wrong sort of people.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m afraid this made me start hoping Rutland does get a McDonald\u2019s. All the complaining made me think: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t they have to have one like everyone else?\u201d It made me want to prick their picturesque bubble so that the whole county is full of McDonald\u2019s and nail bars and Ladbrokes and Wetherspoons, but not a single post office, just like everywhere else.\n\nI was surprised by my own spite and it made me question my motives for liking the lavatory theft. Maybe I wasn\u2019t really attracted to the enterprising underdog, but I\u2019m just pleased when things go wrong. Maybe, amid all the turmoil and division of the last few years, I\u2019m turning nasty.\n\nPlay Video 1:27 David Cameron on Brexit regrets, Boris Johnson and the expulsion of 21 Tory MPs \u2013 video\n\nWhich brings me to David Cameron. The former prime minister has been cutting a surprisingly sympathetic figure as he plugs his book, with apparently wholehearted contrition for some of his most egregious failures and beguilingly expressed condemnation of the arseholes those failures brought to power.\n\nBut the consequences keep mounting. Millions of us feel more confused, worried, conflicted, angry and just plain mean than ever before. David Dimbleby said last week: \u201cI lived through Suez, the miners\u2019 strike, I lived through the poll tax debate and\u2026 the Iraq demonstrations \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen the country so divided as this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s more David Cameron\u2019s fault than anyone else\u2019s. Yet, in terms of image, he\u2019s the beneficiary of his own blunders. He let the country down so catastrophically, and such ignoble fools and villains have come to prominence as a result, that, next to them, he looks comparatively statesmanlike. He stands tidily beside the mess he made. Like a bewildered aristocrat whose loo has been ripped out in the night, the clumsy and selfish architect of the wreckage surveys it in a spotless shirt.", "description": "Like the thieves who stole the glittering khazi, our memoir-hawking former prime minister seems to have got off scot-free", "authors": ["David Mitchell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7726e076dd2bb6110acc55a79a9bdc134dd9a266/0_0_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cb465b046ba20acc16308fae08b908bf", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
