Couples arrange elaborate photoshoots in the hope they go viral; Amazon Prime has made a TV series chronicling the lives of two wedding planners in Delhi; and one celebration in December 2018 \u2013 at which Beyonc\u00e9 performed \u2013 was rumoured to have cost as much as $100m (\u00a380m).\n\nYet the Bangalore photographer Mahesh Shantaram goes so far as to claim that \u201cthe wedding-industrial complex keeps the mighty wheels of the Indian economy turning\u201d. The images in his Matrimania project \u2013 taken at more than 150 weddings between 2008 and 2015 \u2013 document moments of humour in the conspicuous celebrations of the Indian upper- and middle-classes.\n\n\u201cEvery wedding is the greatest day of somebody\u2019s lives, and they\u2019re offering to share that with the rest of the world,\u201d Shantaram tells BBC Culture. \u201cIn India, it almost feels as though the rest of the world attends the wedding. It\u2019s rarely a small and intimate occasion.\u201d In his essay accompanying the photos, he writes: \u201cThings get a little crazy when the floodgates of the wedding season open days after Diwali. For example, on November 27, 2011, an estimated 60,000 couples tied the knot in Delhi alone, according to the Wall Street Journal\u2026 The great Indian wedding, like the great Indian waistline, has bloated to keep up with great Indian aspirations.\u201d\n\nMore like this:\n\n- Photos that reveal a secret identity\n\n- Spain\u2019s wild party after Fascism\n\n- Disarmingly intimate photos of women\n\nInstead of simply capturing details that might suggest a sense of excess, Shantaram sought out moments of humour that allowed reality to sneak through the polish. It\u2019s an approach with echoes in the work of British photographer Martin Parr, who is a fan, buying copies of the Matrimania book for himself and for Ian Weldon \u2013 another wedding photographer with an off-kilter perspective. \u201cYou could say my photos are outtakes from weddings, not the wedding photography itself,\u201d says Shantaram. \u201cIt\u2019s an inverse, a negative of the typical wedding album, that I make for my clients.\u201d\n\nHe started out with the aim of providing an alternative viewpoint to the usual wedding photographer. \u201cI had a personal history of wedding photos \u2013 I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of weddings, because I just saw them as events that impose upon young Indians old social traditions. I felt a way to respond to that would be through my photography \u2013 to bring photojournalism into wedding photography, which back in the late 2000s was an exercise in pure documenting of rituals. But none of the humorous observations that could be made at weddings \u2013 none of the excitement and energy \u2013 was captured, because wedding photographers thought they had a list of things that they needed to photograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s wedding photography was exactly the same, including my own \u2013 my wife and I simply rejected our wedding album, because it didn\u2019t capture the moments that we remembered, and we didn\u2019t want to remember these so-called moments that were in the book. So that\u2019s when I saw an opportunity to become a wedding photographer with something new to offer, and that\u2019s what I did. It caught on quickly, because people had a natural affinity to what wedding photography should look like in the modern era.\u201d\n\nMatrimania offers a counterpoint to traditional image-making. One photo of a horse has been cropped just to show its legs and a bare foot of the rider; another shows a worker setting off fireworks, forlornly staring at a diving spark. \u201cA typical wedding album, anywhere in the world, is really an edit,\u201d says Shantaram. \u201cIt\u2019s a happy edit, an edit with a purpose: to filter out any sort of critical observations or negativity, and it\u2019s an edit that is determinedly positive. My book is also a wedding album, but it\u2019s made with a different purpose in mind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a reflection of wider Indian society. \u201cThe wedding is where you have to accommodate all the friends and family and extended family, you\u2019ve got to keep them entertained, well-fed. So I\u2019m really looking at the wedding as an event rather than marriage as an institution. But they are interlinked, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cMatrimania is full of symbolism \u2013 you can see symbols of the class and caste divide, who\u2019s working and who are they working for, who\u2019s being served, and how each one knows their status and role in society.\u201d\n\nParr gave him some advice when he first started working on the project. \u201cMy work was mainly about the wedding sets that were left behind after the marriage, because that lent itself to a kind of commentary on what came before \u2013 and Martin told me it won\u2019t work without the people in it, you\u2019ve got to show the people,\u201d says Shantaram. \u201cSo that\u2019s when I started looking at all the people, the participants in this entire event; at the workers, who are an integral part of the operation; at the guests. Looking at everyone who has a role in this \u2013 a typical wedding photographer might say that a wedding is only about the bride and groom. But I wanted to open up the vision, to include all the other actors, to see the relationships between them.\u201d\n\nIn the book, writer Gita Aravamudan praises him for capturing \u201cthe detached moments of the wedding technicians \u2013 when they are momentarily away from the hustle and bustle\u201d. On the periphery, workers ease themselves out of costumes or line up behind refreshment stands, their faces bearing expressions that range between amusement, indifference and boredom.\n\nMatrimania also offers a prism through which we can see the tension between generations in India today. \u201cThere are two Indias going on at the same time, and these two Indias need to co-exist. There\u2019s the traditional India that my parents grew up in, and parents are always trying to foist that on the young Indians, who have one foot in the rest of the modern world and one foot in India. So they\u2019re trying to do that balancing act, and it\u2019s really the ongoing story of India.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Shantaram gave up photographing weddings because of those generational shifts. \u201cWhat you see in Matrimania is a phase that we were going through,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I see happening more and more is that weddings are compressing, because brides and grooms do not want the massive weddings, these are mainly for the parents.\u201d In the book, he writes: \u201cAn Indian couple typically gets married twice in their lifetime. The first is their own wedding, where they have no clue what to expect. The second time is by proxy when they marry their kids off.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the time your children marry, you\u2019ve got more wealth, and you can show who you are in society,\u201d he tells BBC Culture. \u201cThis often has disastrous consequences, because parents start saving up for their children\u2019s weddings from a very early age, and that puts a lot of pressure on it\u2026 What is changing is when young Indians believe this is not what they want to spend a large fraction of their savings or their parents\u2019 savings on \u2013 they\u2019d rather have an intimate wedding, and marry whoever they want \u2013 it could be from any religion, across faith. And when that happens, when Indians decide to get married for love or irrespective of artificial factors like faith, then the weddings become smaller. They want to spend the day only with those who really matter to them.\u201d\n\nYet this still carries a cost. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely controversial in India: people are killed for marrying outside their caste \u2013 it\u2019s not even inter-faith, just different castes within the same faith \u2013 by their own family, and in the name of honour\u2026 There\u2019s a dark underbelly to this otherwise happy occasion that a wedding ought to signify. At every wedding, there are people who are complicit in furthering society\u2019s biases to some extent.\u201d\n\nThat can make some ceremonies a bittersweet occasion, as one of Shantaram\u2019s images reveals. It shows a bride, dancing alone on a balcony \u2013 a joyful photo that also has a melancholic feel. \u201cThis was a wedding where they married for themselves, so the bride made a promise to her mother that she would marry in her home, up in the mountains,\u201d he says. \u201cThey married for love, which is rare in India. But the consequence of that was that the boy\u2019s family completely boycotted the wedding. So it was a very intimate occasion.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
