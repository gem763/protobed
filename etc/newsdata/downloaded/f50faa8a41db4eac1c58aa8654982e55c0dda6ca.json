However, it is reaching that stage where the contestants start to really get invested in the Bachie and we see some true colours coming out.\n\nWhile we\u2019ve seen Abbie\u2018s true colours for some time now, tonight it was Elly\u2018s turn to show the fuck UP. As always, my trusty colleague Mel is my recapping sidekick as we wade our way through this fascinating character study.\n\nMEL: So we started this episode with Matt driving through the countryside, which always baffles me \u2013 why are we always so close to countryside when the mansion is clearly in Sydney? Sure, I can believe Matt going for a short 2 hour drive out to Goulburn \u2013 what amused me to no end was Helena just standing on the side of the fucking highway like she\u2019d been dumped there at 6am.\n\nJOSIE: Shivering there in her white linen shorts and off the shoulder top in 8 degree weather, questioning all her life choices. Really, I think the countryside dates are a wonderful excuse for some Hyundai product placement, which they really ramped up to 11 tonight. When Helena looked admiringly at his dull soccer mom SVU and said \u2018Nice wheels!\u2019 you know they\u2019d taken the sponsorship promises one step too far.\n\nMEL: She said it like \u201cYieeeewwww sick wheeeels bro!\u201d too which like, it was a gunmetal blimp of a vehicle. I don\u2019t hate that car but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s on par with a Ferrari. So Matt picks up his hitchhiker and instead of murdering her, which would be a more helpful lesson to anyone viewing, he takes her to an empty cow field where there\u2019s a huge 10 year plan science diorama set up.\n\nJOSIE: Mel, we paused this date about 3 times because we had so many thoughts and feelings and honestly just couldn\u2019t stomach it in one go. I\u2019ve never seen anything more offensive on the Bachelor and we\u2019re talking about a season where someone got booted for doing a Trent from Punchy impersonation . WHAT WAS THIS \u201cDATE\u201d. I know it\u2019s a dating show so things are going to be a bit cooked, but why on earth did they think anyone would be okay with mapping out their 10 year plan with a guy they\u2019ve spent maybe 2 hours of solo time with who also happens to have 5 other girls on the go? Of COURSE Helena was going to be freaked out and awkward about doing that. MEL: I know, it was actually so fucked up. I know the Bachelor is a non-conventional way to meet the love of your life and you\u2019d have to go in understand that a) things are gonna go a bit 0-100 and b) cameras will be in your face at all times. But why should Helena, who has had one solo date and one group dinner party with Matt, have their next 10 years confidently mapped out already? She barely knows the guy \u2013 just let them go hang out with some champers and be slightly more normal with each other, you know?\n\nJOSIE: I think we were even more enraged because we thought it was going to be some vehicle to boot Helena, which would have been really unfair. But after she had a small meltdown about that element of the date, Matt dragged her through the bushes in the dark and for a moment I thought he might be a murderer. But it turned out there was a projection of the moon (because he\u2019s an aStRoPhYsiCisT remember) and a copper bathtub and this made her weep with joy, for some reason. And she managed to explain herself and her feelings a bit better, which was impressive to do whilst wedged into a tiny bathtub with a large man who she barely knows.

I can\u2019t imagine anyone weeping over that setup if they didn\u2019t kinda think Matt had made the moon disappear then re-appear. It was pretty but it wasn\u2019t emotional outburst pretty.\n\nI did like the way Helena expressed her feelings. She didn\u2019t gush over Matt like he was Brad Pitt with glasses. She was just like, I really like you and I can see myself falling in love with you. I\u2019m not a HUGE Helena fan in terms of Matt\u2019s life partner because I think she\u2019s a bit too fancy and proper for his goofy nature, but she has a good head on her shoulders as Alf from Home & Away would say.\n\nJOSIE: Yeah, she is probably one of the Bachelor contestants with the least BS to dish out, I reckon. So after all of that she got a rose, and I was glad because I thought that date was so fucked up. Then for the group date it was Chelsie\u2018s turn to have a complete meltdown but tbh I thought this was a slight overreaction? Like I understood Helena\u2019s reservations about the solo date activity but all Chelsie had to do on the group date was drink some wine and paint a silly picture of herself.\n\nMEL: Chelsie freaking out about putting \u201cherself\u201d into the artwork was a bit WTF. I understand she\u2019s saying she\u2019s holding back because of some bad past relationship, but you didn\u2019t actually have to paint the words ANXIETY and LOW SELF-ESTEEM on the painting. In fact, you were meant to do the opposite, kinda express what you\u2019d look like in drag.\n\nJOSIE: It was supposed to be a fun and zesty activity and the drag queen literally had to take her into a room and give her a pep talk. Somehow this pep talk gave Chelsie the confidence to paint rainbow hair on her self-portrait, which in turn greatly impressed Matt. Honestly, this show sometimes. I feel like if I tried to explain it to, like, my dad, he\u2019d think I was having some kind of stroke.\n\nMEL: \u201cAnd then Bachelor Matt chose Chelsie because she put glitter on her brain and painted a crack in the background to show she was broken but fixing herself\u201d.\n\nSo Chelsie and Matt choof off for some solo time, which is dead boring except for the bit where she alarmingly says, seemingly to me out of nowhere, that she\u2019s falling in love with the guy. Not \u201ccan see myself\u201d falling in love \u2013 she reckons she deadset is already.\n\nJOSIE: I mean for someone who was too shy and retiring to place some glitter on a canvas 30 minutes ago it was QUITE the 180. He obviously loved it, though. I feel like that \u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you\u201d line is like catnip to these Bachie men. It speaks straight to their ego and also to their penis. I reckon she booked herself a ticket to hometowns in that moment.\n\nMEL: Hard agree, even though I fucking hate it? Bitchhhhh you have had 2 dates with this guy you cannot possibly be falling in love with him, it simply doesn\u2019t happen that way. I don\u2019t believe it. She seems pretty honest though, I\u2019d say she hundo thinks she\u2019s falling in love but \u2013 as you said to me in passing \u2013 Chelsie is 28 going on 20 in our eyes.\n\nJOSIE: Oh I hate it too. I reckon it\u2019s game-playing from her, in a way. All the Bachelor men want is for the girls to \u201copen up\u201d even though the Bachelor men can never open up because they\u2019re dating 25 girls. Wonderful double standard! And yes there is something very awkward about her that reminds me of being in that weird late teens/early 20s phase when you don\u2019t know yourself or what the fuck is going on.\n\nMEL: Yes! I feel like she is not a mature 28, she\u2019s a young 28. I relate to this! That was me! And that\u2019s completely fine but this is a good example of how age isn\u2019t as important as some people on this show have made it out to be. You can be wise beyond your years at 24, or a baby at 30. Anyway, she gets a rose for saying she was in love almost, and then it\u2019s time for the fucken cocktail party. My favourite moment, always.\n\nJOSIE: Because there\u2019s so few girls left it\u2019s a really weird vibe don\u2019t you reckon? Because suddenly Matt has a lot more time to spend talking so it\u2019s more about who gets him first rather than who gets to talk to him at all. So after last night\u2019s debacle of being out-demoned by Abbie, Elly decided she wasn\u2019t going to be stomped on again because she \u201cneeded to talk to Matt first\u201d. But it didn\u2019t really work out that way because no one can outplay Abbie.\n\nMEL: Nope \u2013 Abbie positioned herself RIGHT where Matt walks in, and grabbed him. Which like \u2013 fair enough, I say. What does she owe Elly? I know people would say \u201cwell she took the date card from Elly last episode so she could at least let her have the time\u201d and I do think she could have, but I also see that Abbie\u2019s focused on her own relationship with Matt. She\u2019s playing The Bachelor like it\u2019s Survivor and I\u2019m not entirely sure it\u2019s\u2026 not a mood for me??\n\nJOSIE: On one hand it\u2019s like, Matt\u2019s not a prize and on Survivor you win a bunch of money. So I can see why people hate the way Abbie is, because she\u2019s extremely intense and competitive and ruthless and it\u2019s a dating show, not a show that is designed to test your game playing and manipulating skills like Survivor (she would win that show hands down). But on the other hand I also see her point of like, she\u2019s not her to make friends, she\u2019s here for Matt and she doesn\u2019t want to help others further their relationship with Matt? Like why would you if you also like Matt? A few weeks ago I thought she was just a two-dimensional villain character but now I\u2019m seeing her point of view a little more.\n\nMEL: SAME (stay tuned everyone for my very intense Bachelor thinkpiece on Abbie, coming to you in\u2026 5 minutes). I don\u2019t love her behaviour, but I don\u2019t entirely hate it. Anyway \u2013 Elly has had enough of this and walks over with a shit-eating grin on her face to interrupt the pair. Stunning stuff.\n\nJOSIE: I adored the shit-eating grin, I have to say. But maybe not what followed it? She came over and asked to speak to Matt about \u201csomething important\u201d, and then the \u201csomething important\u201d was just word for word what Sogand had been spouting about Abbie for 3 weeks. YAWN. It\u2019s like the spirit of dear, departed Sogand possessed the usually easygoing Elly. Like whyyyyy do they seem so set on the idea that Matt simply must know that Abbie\u2019s \u201cnot here for the right reasons\u201d?! Aside from the baby / marriage stuff there hasn\u2019t been that much evidence that she\u2019s not, tbh. It was a bit despo from Elly, who usually seems so chill.\n\nMEL: Yeah it was hugely not a vibe for me. I find any time someone backstabs another, even if they think they have good reason to, they come off as the asshole. Elly just looked petty and bogged down in the drama of the mansion! She should have used the time to just tell Bachelor Matt whatever she originally wanted to back before the date card saga, IMO.\n\nJOSIE: Just use the opportunity to reiterate how you\u2019re feeling, that you like him, that you \u201ccan see yourself falling in love with him\u201d, have a cheeky pash, whatever! Put your best self forward instead of trashing someone else, I reckon. It was all just a bit high school and like so out of character for her. It was honestly like Sogand had ripped out some of Elly\u2019s hair and cooked up a bloody polyjuice potion just to keep the I Hate Abbie movement going. Anyway, he took it on board and then it was rose ceremony time \u2013 between Elly, Abbie, Emma and Kristen. MEL: We were proper gripping our chairs with stress over this \u2013 I couldn\u2019t see Abbie going home after that next-level tension, producers surely wouldn\u2019t allow it. But I\u2019d considered Kristen a quiet front-runner for this whole season! Sadly, she wasn\u2019t one in Bachelor Matt\u2019s eyes, and she copped the boot. JOSIE: As you said to him in your best Julia Roberts voice: \u201cBig mistake. HUGE.\u201d But since they\u2019re both still here, I cannot wait for the Elly and Abbie drama to hit the proverbial fan.", "description": "The Bachelor Australia may be at that boring point but you know there's still drama to be had: this time courtesy of Elly and Abbie.", "authors": ["Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke", "Melissa Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/elly-fb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
