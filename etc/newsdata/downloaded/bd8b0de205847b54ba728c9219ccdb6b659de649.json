There's no chance we'll even discipline him.\"\n\nIn response, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the \"Chinese government never posed this requirement.\"\n\nShortly before the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets played a pair of preseason games in China last week, Morey posted and then deleted a tweet that read: \"Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe tweet was in reference to recent protests in Hong Kong regarding a bill that would allow suspected criminals to be extradited from Hong Kong to China despite there being no extradition agreement in place. Protesters believe the bill would threaten Hong Kong's autonomy if passed.\n\nIn the wake of backlash from China regarding the tweet, including multiple sponsors severing ties with the NBA and Chinese television station CCTV refusing to air the two preseason games, Silver released a statement:\n\nThe preseason games in China went ahead as scheduled, but players and coaches were not made available to the media.\n\nDuring Silver's appearance at the Time 100 Summit, he said: \"The losses have already been substantial. Our games are not back on the air in China as we speak, and we'll see what happens next. I don't know where we go from here. The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\"\n\nThe NBA has been a huge deal in China ever since the Rockets selected Yao Ming with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2002 draft, and preseason games have been held in China every year since 2012.", "description": "A  Chinese foreign ministry spokesman refuted a claim Friday by NBA Commissioner  Adam Silver  that the Chinese government asked him to fire Houston Rockets general manager Daryl ...", "authors": ["Mike"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/833/773/hi-res-4860948d8992495d028e279439473c4b_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
