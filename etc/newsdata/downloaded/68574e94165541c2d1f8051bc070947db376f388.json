I took my frustration in not getting a unification bout out on Takoucht.\u201d\n\nWarrington had pledged that he wanted a US fight against the other world champions after a past year in which he proved his world-class qualities with a triumph over Lee Selby to claim the belt, before defending against Carl Frampton.\n\n\u201cI have made it very clear I am open to any of them,\u201d said Warrington. \u201cGary Russell Jnr is kicking about. Shakur Stevenson could be fighting for the WBO [World Boxing Organistion] title. If Xu Can [a World Boxing Association champion] wants the fight, here I am.\u201d\n\nWarrington is expected to fight again next May, with promoter Frank Warren looking to bring one of the major names back to Elland Road. If not, Warrington is prepared to go on the road to fight.", "description": "Josh Warrington completed a third defence of his International Boxing Federation world featherweight title with a second-round stoppage victory over Frenchman Sofiane Takoucht in Leeds and put every rival on notice that he will pursue them for unification contests next year.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212859270-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqlnoKbsnqupgsmdP1L78oDUt3dIFmRH3kYeuhKPCWwP4.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
