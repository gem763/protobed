But it will be a huge break", "language": "en", "text": "By Sanjay Kirloskar\n\nIndia and the US are an odd couple. Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping conduct their two-day \u2018informal summit\u2019 in Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu, and despite the fact that the two democracies can\u2019t stop bickering under their breath, they do keep professing their love for each quite loudly.\n\nIndia and the US accuse each other of unfair trade practices and are among the most active litigants at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). And, yet, they are each other\u2019s anchor in their geopolitical strategy in the Asia Pacific \u2014 a region now significantly renamed Indo-Pacific according to the US\u2019 redrawn strategic map.\n\nThe public display of affection between Prime Minister Modi and US President Donald Trump is hard to ignore. Yet, progress on bilateral trade, investment and immigration issues has remained disjointed.\n\nThe trade ministers and officials of the two countries argued, while Modi and Trump hugged and sang paeans to each other. India and the US need to deepen both the economic and the strategic aspects of their relationship. Mutual strategic interest alone cannot sustain a meaningful relationship.\n\nThe governments of both countries need to settle on a framework of doing business with each other as soon as possible. Essentially, they need a free-trade agreement (FTA).\n\nIt does help that both Modi and Trump wear their nationalism on their sleeves, and can also see each other\u2019s point of view. A mutual agreement would be more meaningful to them than reliance on any multilateral arbitrator.\n\nThe US has been pushing India for an FTA for some time now, and Trump is keen to announce a trade deal with India \u2014 even an interim one \u2014 as soon as possible. He is on a mission to erase the US\u2019 trade deficit with every country, and he may like a quick feather in his cap by neutralising the $24 billion goods and services trade deficit with India.\n\nTrump promised to bring \u2018Made-in-America\u2019 products to Indian consumers at Modi\u2019s recent rally in Houston. The US has offered to make India an alternative business hub in the Indo-Pacific, if it signs an FTA.\n\nTrading Emotions\n\nBusiness leaders of the two countries are quite eager to see the trade niggle between them sorted out as quickly as possible, and that a clear, fair and stable agreement that assures policy and tariff certainty is established.\n\nA delegation of Indian CEOs attending the All India Management Association\u2019s (AIMA) US-India Conference at University of California Berkeley on September 27 voiced the need for the two countries to invest in each other\u2019s strengths.\n\nEven though India may not gain much in terms of tariff reductions from the US, since its tariffs are already very low, it can gain a lot by bargaining for an easier access to the US\u2019 high-paying market, plentiful capital and latest technologies.\n\nHowever, a common ground will have to be found between \u2018America First\u2019 and \u2018Make in India\u2019. India would struggle to lower its tariffs, which average about 13%, without hurting local producers and its tax revenues. It will have to be innovative in creating trade-offs that deliver positive net returns.\n\nAgriculture and dairy would be particularly contentious areas because of subsidy and phytosanitary issues. The digital economy has to be central to any FTA, given the rapid shift to digital technologies in both countries.\n\nAn FTA will have to reconcile data nationalism with the internet\u2019s innate globalism. India\u2019s linking of its sovereignty with possession of data, and the US\u2019 linking of its national security with origin of vendors, will pose significant challenges to FTA negotiators.\n\nBilateral trade in professional services would grow along with the growth in economic and strategic integration. It is always tricky to open up markets for licence-dependent professional services, such as audit, law and medicine. But associated services such as accounting, para-legal work and diagnostics can be traded aplenty.\n\nHowever, free mobility of professionals and data is a fundamental requirement. The two countries will have to work out ways to ensure that.\n\nIntellectual property (IP) has always been a big issue for the US. India will need to strengthen its patent and trademark regime to satisfy the Americans. India would want similar guarantees from the US for its IP, especially in the software, entertainment and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nDone Deal\n\nThe FTA will have to cover for non-tariff barriers to trade. Often, exporters are frustrated by harassment by customs, despite compliance. Recently, US companies have complained of Chinese officials dismantling built-up vehicles in the name of inspection.\n\nAchieving an FTA that makes everybody happy is unlikely. But having an FTA would be a huge improvement on not having one. Time has come to replace ad-hoc policies and tariffs with clear, long-term framework for trade and investment between the two countries.\n\nThe writer is president, All India Management Association (AIMA)", "description": "By Sanjay Kirloskar India and the US are an odd couple.
