Allotments are leased from landlords and plotholders pay rent to cover water and other general maintenance bills. These are estimated to cost a plotholder between \u00a325-\u00a3125 ($30-$151) a year.\n\nThe academic, who has written a paper on the subject for the Food Research Collaboration network, said allotments deserved greater support, providing far more food, far more sustainably and with far more benefits to their users than widely known.\n\nREAD MORE: France to treat Britain \u2018like South Africa\u2019 in Brexit dress rehearsal\n\n\u201cThere could be a campaign to encourage people to grow their own food, providing seeds and training which wouldn\u2019t cost much. It could be in people\u2019s gardens too,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a precedent and a parallel with the \u2018Dig for Victory\u2019 campaign. We were cut off from food supplies and that was very successful, producing an estimated 10% of our food from gardens and allotments.\n\n\u201cThen it was a matter of life and death; now it\u2019s to save the the planet in a different way. You can imagine Boris [Johnson] saying it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\n\n\u2018Allotments are surprisingly productive\u2019\n\nDave Goulson is pushing for an allotment boom.

Across the nation, open spaces were turned into vegetable patches, including public parks.\n\nIt is for this reason Goulson says we can should seriously consider allotments as a viable way of growing much more of Britain\u2019s food.\n\n\u201cThey are surprisingly productive. You might not think so as holders are only amateurs, but we quantified how much people produce and it\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he found in research some allotment holders were producing 35 tonnes per hectare, compared to between \u201ceight and 10\u201d hectares for many growers of wheat, one of Britain\u2019s major crops.\n\nBut Goulson said separate studies had shown allotments were also \u201csurprisingly rich in biodiversity,\u201d and even better than parks and gardens.\n\nREAD MORE: No-deal Brexit could wipe out \u2018more than half\u2019 of UK farms\n\n\u201cYou can have food and nature hand in hand \u2014 I think that\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d he said in an interview with Yahoo Finance UK.\n\nHe highlighted their environmental benefits, saying they tend to have more organic matter than many commercial farms. More carbon is stored in the soil and prevented from going into the atmosphere, he said.\n\nThe benefits to allotment holders themselves from physical activity, engaging with nature and with other people is also significant, he added, with one study suggesting they were consistently happier than their neighbours.", "description": "An expert calls for a home-grown food revolution, replacing EU subsidies with support for allotments, sustainable farming and seeds and training for the public.", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4wutyuKqY._vvaXe4PnahA--~B/aD0yNDg0O3c9Mzg2MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/d2b99870-cb0e-11e9-97df-2afc55159ef5"}
