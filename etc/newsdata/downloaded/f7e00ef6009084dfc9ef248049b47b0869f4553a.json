It never was", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE A year after a limousine crash in Schoharie, New York left 20 dead, communities and families are still figuring out their new way of life. Georgie Silvarole, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n\nALBANY, N.Y. \u2013 Workers at a Mavis Discount Tire shop falsified records to make it look as if they completed brake work on a limousine before it crashed and killed 20 in Schoharie, New York, last year, when in actuality the work was never performed, according to the shop's former manager.\n\nVirgil Park, who managed the shop until he was terminated in February, told prosecutors last month that he purchased a brake master cylinder on May 4, 2018, for the 2001 Ford Excursion stretch limo.\n\nBut the part, which converts force from the driver's foot into hydraulic pressure on the brakes, was never installed despite an invoice saying it was.\n\nPark claims the part was returned to Advance Auto Parts eight days later, according to a letter filed in court last week by Schoharie County District Attorney Susan Mallery, whose office conducted the interview.\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2018, the same stretch limo blew through an intersection before striking a parked vehicle in the parking lot of the Apple Barrel Country Store. The crash killed the driver, two bystanders and 17 passengers who were en route to celebrate a birthday.\n\n\"Although the invoice from May 11, 2018, indicates that this part was installed, Mr. Parks (sic) informed us that an employee, Chikezie Okoro, told him that the part was not installed,\" Mallery wrote in the letter, which was first reported by the Times Union of Albany.\n\nNew York limo crash: NTSB issues new safety recommendations for limo seating, seat belts\n\nNauman Hussain is brought into Cobleskill Town, N.Y., court for arraignment Wednesday, Oct. 10, 2018. Limousine service operator, Hussain, was charged Wednesday with criminally negligent homicide in a crash that killed 20 people, while police continued investigating what caused the wreck and whether anyone else will face charges.

The National Transportation Safety Board has not yet determined an official cause.\n\nNeither Park nor Okoro could immediately be located for comment Wednesday. A spokesman for Mavis Discount Tire did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nMallery's Oct. 7 letter was sent to Hussain's attorney under court rules requiring prosecutors to share potentially exonerating evidence to the defense.\n\nAccording to Mallery's letter, Park claimed the Mavis shop would falsify invoices \u2014 swapping out certain services for the work actually performed \u2014 in order to try and hit sales quotas established by the company's corporate office.\n\nThat includes June 2018 invoices that purported to show brake labor for the limousine involved in the Oct. 6, 2018 crash when no brake work was actually performed.\n\nPark also told prosecutors he did not perform a DMV inspection \u2014 the type performed on normal passenger vehicles, not high-capacity limos \u2014 of the vehicle but provided a certification card for it.\n\nAt the time of the wreck, the limo had a DMV inspection sticker but not the required DOT one.\n\nDefense says Mavis deserves blame\n\nA day after receiving Mallery's letter, Hussain's attorneys Joseph Tacopina and Chad Seigel sent their own letter to Bartlett, claiming Mavis' actions are to blame for the wreck.\n\n\"Despite billing for the preceding services, Mavis never performed them,\" Hussain's attorneys wrote. \"Stated otherwise, Mavis's fraudulent conduct \u2014 not anything undertaken by defendant Nauman Hussain \u2014 was the true legal cause of the accident.\"\n\nMallery did not immediately return a call to her office Wednesday morning.\n\nHussain is set to stand trial in March.\n\nSo far, at least three victims' families have filed suit against Mavis, faulting the auto shop chain's Saratoga Springs location for inspecting the limousine when it should have been subject to the more-rigorous, biannual DOT inspection.\n\n\u201cThis is about holding people accountable who played a role in this tragic and preventable accident, and we feel that Mavis did play a role,\" said Paul Davenport, an Albany-based attorney representing the estates of Shane and Erin McGowan, in an interview last month.\n\nFollow Jon Campbell on Twitter: @JonCampbellGAN\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/09/new-york-limo-crash-mavis-discount-tire-shop-falsified-brake-records/3920945002/", "description": "Records said brake work was completed on a\u00a0limousine before it\u00a0crashed and killed 20 in New York\u00a0last year.
