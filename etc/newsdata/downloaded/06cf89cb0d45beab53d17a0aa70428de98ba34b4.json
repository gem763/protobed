Hoehn's girlfriend, Brooke Crews, admitted she sliced Greywind's baby from her womb. She was sentenced to life without parole.\n\nJustices ruled in August that a judge mistakenly classified Hoehn as a dangerous special offender and he should not have received life. Hoehn now faces 21 years in prison on two charges.\n\nGloria Allred, Greywind family attorney, says Savanna's relatives were \"disappointed and upset\" about the ruling and hope Hoehn receives the maximum sentence at Monday's hearing.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
