Both carry political risks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe cheapest possible way to make sure that everyone gets health care is Medicare-for-all,\u201d the senator from Massachusetts said at the end of a town hall in Indianola, attended by about 475 people. \u201cWhat I see, though, is, we need to talk about costs.\u201d Over \u201cthe next few weeks,\u201d Warren added, she will offer a proposal for \u201cspecifically how we pay for it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Medicare-for-all legislation introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in 2017 does not lay out how the proposal would be funded. A separate \u201cwhite paper\u201d proposed some ideas, like a 4 percent \u201cpremium\u201d paid by families making more than $29,000 per year.\n\nSanders has not shied away from telling voters they will have to pay higher taxes under a Medicare-for-all plan. But, he\u2019s said, that cost would be more than offset by other savings.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health-care bills,\u201d Sanders said at last week\u2019s debate in Ohio. \u201cBut I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They\u2019re going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.\u201d\n\nWarren supports the Medicare-for-all bill unveiled by Sanders. But so far, she\u2019s refused to say taxes will go up for middle-class families, even when asked directly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a result, she has been taking fire on the cost question from her Democratic rivals. In a Sunday interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg scoffed at the idea that Warren might use \u201cpay-fors\u201d previously sketched out by Sanders.\n\n\u201cWe need to see how this is going to be paid for,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cRight now, whether you copy-paste the Bernie Sanders math or do it some other way, there is a hole amounting to trillions of dollars in how this is supposed to work.\u201d\n\nSingle-payer advocates have been frustrated by the tax and cost debate, pointing out that the cost of the entire program \u2014 usually pegged at $30 trillion over 10 years \u2014 does not factor in how much taxpayers shell out for insurance under the current system.\n\n\u201cThe single-payer taxation debate constantly, frustratingly, refuses to differentiate between literal compulsory taxes and virtually compulsory private taxes \u2014 premiums, hospital bills, etc.,\u201d said Timothy Faust, author of the Medicare-for-all tract \u201cHealth Justice Now,\u201d and a supporter of single-payer insurance. \u201cThe only reason to advocate for the public option is if you fundamentally believe that it is important to keep insurance companies profitable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWarren said Sunday that current estimates show Medicare-for-all will cost \u201ctrillions and trillions\u201d of dollars, and added that \u201cthere are a lot\u201d of potential revenue streams.\n\nShe also said that she\u2019s been working on her plan to pay for the proposal for \u201cmonths and months.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s just a little more work until it\u2019s finished.\u201d\n\nWarren, using a double negative, repeated a pledge that she won\u2019t sign a bill into law that \u201cdoes not reduce the cost of health care for middle class families.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a reporter after her town hall if her plan would include taxes on the middle class, Warren declined to answer saying: \u201cThe whole plan will be out \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to look at it.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "She continued to deflect questions about whether middle-class taxes would rise under her proposal.", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign", "David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/jSTDhM8n-JPW_DDhLVRmx1EWU3s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SXM6EJHTQ4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
