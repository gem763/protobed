To attribute the fraud of a trusted agent of the company to the company would denude the duty of any value in cases where it is most needed and be a retrograde step,\" the Supreme Court said.\n\n(Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by Jason Neely and Elaine Hardcastle)", "description": "By Huw JonesLONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Daiwa Capital Markets Europe  lost a court appeal on Wednesday that leaves the  Japanese bank facing a $150 million...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
