But most importantly, Waller-Bridge recaps her incredible night at the Emmys and also offers a drop of hope for Fleabag fans who don\u2019t want the show to be over for good. \u201cI quite like the idea of coming back to her \u2014 well, me \u2014 when I\u2019m 50, because I feel like she would\u2019ve had, you know, more life then, and God knows what she would\u2019ve gotten up to,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd actually seeing a character like that in a later stage of life, I think, is exciting. But I think for now, she\u2019s been through enough! We\u2019ve got to let her go!\u201d\n\nMeyers also asks Waller-Bridge about how much she knew about SNL before getting her hosting gig, and she admits that her knowledge of the show was mostly limited to clips of sketches on YouTube. \u201cIt was never aired in the U.K., so I didn\u2019t know the madness that it is and how you create it and how it\u2019s written,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just thought it was a sketch show that you have time to prepare for. And turns out you don\u2019t, do you?\u201d", "description": "During her appearance on NBC\u2019s \u2018Late Night,\u2019 Phoebe Waller-Bridge told host Seth Meyers that she might make more \u2018Fleabag\u2019 when she\u2019s 50.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-phoebe-waller-bridge.w1200.h630.jpg"}
