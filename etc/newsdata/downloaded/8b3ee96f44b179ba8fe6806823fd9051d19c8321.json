People now understand the situation within Saudi better than they ever had before.\n\nAssiri, who spoke to Khashoggi just days before he vanished, has faced numerous threats himself, and Amnesty International believes his phone was hacked due to his communications with the late journalist.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, there was a statement read at the UN human rights council signed by 15 EU member states, criticising the regime for its terrible human rights situation and demanding an international investigation into the murder of Khashoggi,\u201d Assiri continues.\n\n\u201cThis would never have happened before.\u201d\n\nMonitoring groups have repeatedly ranked Saudi Arabia as having one of the worst rights records in the world, including being among the last countries in the world to ban women drivers and to continue public executions. But at the same time, the Kingdom has been heralded as the West\u2019s vital moderate ally in the battle against extremism.\n\nHowever, since the devastating details of Khashoggi\u2019s killing were revealed, that has changed, Assiri argues. He said even he \u201ccould not believe the horrific details\" of what happened to his friend.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

I couldn\u2019t believe it, it did not seem possible,\u201d Asiri recalls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing. The credibility of the regime was completely destroyed.\u201d\n\nIyad Baghdadi, another fervent critic of the Saudi regime who knew Khashoggi well, agrees. Baghdadi has said that in April he was whisked away by agents in Norway, where he lives, after they informed him of a specific threat that emanated from Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe said he felt the world was finally paying attention, and the Norwegian authorities would not have acted so quickly in the past.\n\n\u201cIn a way Jamal is protecting us right now. His murder has made it so much more difficult for Mohamed Bin Salman to kill dissidents again,\u201d he tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that we're not safe, but we're also aware the Arab world's new Gaddafi has a lot to lose if he tries it again,\u201d he adds.\n\nJamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the 2 October to pick up divorce papers, as his fianc\u00e9e waited outside. He was never seen leaving the building; his body never found.\n\nDetails of his death were only revealed by Turkish intelligence officers who had been secretly tapping the consulate. Two experts on a UN investigating team who listened to 45 minutes of recordings revealed in interviews with the BBC this week that they heard members of the hit squad joking about butchery even before Khashoggi got there.\n\nBut the Saudis, who at first denied the killing took place in the consulate, then blamed the murder on rogue operatives who they said had intended to forcibly repatriate him. Saudi\u2019s public prosecutor said Khashoggi was killed after discussions for his return failed.\n\nThe prosecutor added that Saud al-Qahtani, a former top royal adviser who is believed to have given orders over Skype to the killers, briefed the hit team on Khashoggi\u2019s activities before the operation.\n\nThe whereabouts of al-Qahtani and other members of the killing team remain unknown. No one has been properly punished.\n\nMohamed Bin Salman, meanwhile, in two interviews with American networks over the last week has again denied ordering the killing but said he takes full responsibility, as it \u201chappened under my watch\u201d.\n\nUN expert Agn\u00e8s Callamard in her interview with BBC dismissed this defence as \u201cproblematic\u201d, saying \u201che is only taking corporate responsibility\u201d for the killing.\u200b Khashoggi had once been at the heart of the regime, serving as a media aide to Saudi\u2019s ambassadors abroad in the 2000s. He was also editor in chief of Saudi Arabian daily al-Watan.\n\nHe was later banned from writing for Saudis newspapers and in 2017 went into self-imposed exile in the US, where he held residency, and becoming a columnist for The Washington Post and a critic of the regime, albeit a gentle one.\n\nIn one of his first pieces for the American daily he wrote \u201cwe are not opposed to our government and care deeply about Saudi Arabia ... Yet we are the enemy.\u201d\n\nTen days before his murder, he spoke to Assiri about penning a letter to the crown prince urging him to free political prisoners, including a string of Saudi women\u2019s rights activists who disappeared into jails in the summer of 2018 for fighting oppressive legislation.\n\n\u201cEven in his last days he was trying to find a compromise. He wanted to send a nice letter to MBS, making it clear freeing prisoners of conscience would be good PR for him,\u201d Assiri tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cI disagreed with Jamal, telling him: \u2018You have tried so many times\u2019. He replied: \u2018Our friends behind bars deserve our best efforts to free them\u2019. They killed him before he could finish a draft.\u201d\n\nThe killing of such a prominent yet mildly-spoken critic of Saudi was so surprising it \u201copened Pandora\u2019s box\u201d, according to prominent London-based dissident Saad al-Faqih.\n\n\u201cPeople went back and re-examined the Saudi blockade on Qatar, the diplomatic clash with Canada, the war in Yemen, the [alleged Saudi kidnapping of] Lebanese Prime minister Saad Hariri,\u201d al-Faqih tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cLife for the dissident in terms of our message was easier to convey than before and much easier for people inside the country to digest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world's eyes are on MBS,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn Germany, a Saudi royal in exile who has watched distant members of his family vanish into house arrest, said that before Khashoggi's murder, German police would likely not have rushed to aid as they did 10 days ago, when he sounded the alarm about a potential threat.\n\nPrince Khalid bin Farhan al-Saudi said international uproar at Khashoggi\u2019s murder had also incentivised and empowered Saudi activists in exile to launch a slew of new projects.\n\nEarlier this year he started an organisation to help Saudi activists fleeing the Kingdom set up their lives abroad. More recently he formed a political movement calling for regime change and a constitutional monarchy, which is far more dangerous than any of Khashoggi\u2019s tempered criticism of the state.\n\nAnd that is why the prince believes he is constantly monitored by pro-Saudi regime figures.\n\nHe said someone stole all the plants from is balcony and his beloved a cat, \u201cas a kind of message\u201d last week, prompting the German police to guard his building. In the past he claimed the regime had attempted to lure him to Saudi's consulates much like Jamal.\n\n\u201cPeople take us seriously now, I have more protection,\u201d he tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cAlthough I still look left and right, and behind me wherever I go, although I can\u2019t go out in the evenings, I\u2019m pushing ahead with my new movement.\u201d\n\nHe claimed he is even enlisting the support of disgruntled princes within the Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile in Ireland, Abdulaziz Almoayyad, another activist in exile, worked with Khashoggi on an online resistance movement. Called the \u201cBee Army\u201d, it offers cyber protection to activists needing a safe platform to speak out within the Kingdom amid a surge in pro-Saudi automated Twitter accounts, known as \u201celectronic flies\u201d.\n\nAfter Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Almoayyad launched a new initiative enlisting journalists to write 1,000 articles imagining what Khashoggi would have written if he hadn\u2019t been killed.\n\n\u201cHe could have written 52 articles every week in the Washington Post over the last year if he was still alive. So, we are telling journalists keep his voice alive through us,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting back as hard as we can. Nobody has paid a price for Khashoggi\u2019s killing but we have public opinion on our side.\u201d\n\nWe are fighting back as hard as we can... we have public opinion on our side Abdulaziz Almoayyad. Saudi activist in Ireland\n\nIn an undisclosed location, a Saudi rights activist who operates under the pseudonym Regina Nasr, 30, says she is fighting to secure the freedom of as many as 17 female protesters who vanished in jails or are in unknown locations within Saudi Arabia.\n\nAmong them is Loujain al-Hathloul, also 30, who was arrested last May in a sweep of arrests, after fighting Saudi Arabia\u2019s archaic ban on women driving and its stifling male guardianship system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrific thing that happened but if there was one positive outcome: the world finally understands what is really happening in Saudi,\u201d she tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cBefore they dismissed us all as spoilt, rich and happy.
