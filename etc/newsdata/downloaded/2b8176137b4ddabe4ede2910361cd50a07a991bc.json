I knew straight away that it was Emma and there must be some breaking news 191 miles away.\n\n\u201cHi, love, you\u2019ll never guess... Max has had another offer of a heart. I\u2019ve just spoken with Lisa on the ward.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve not woken him, as there is no point. If it happens, it will be half past two in the afternoon when he goes to theatre. Can you make your way up in the morning?\u201d\n\nIt was at around two o\u2019clock when the transplant co-ordinator, Alison, came to confirm the transplant was going ahead and Max would be taken to theatre at around three.\n\nMax stood on his bed and asked me for a hug. I stood and held him tight, his soft blond hair gently tickling my cheek. Max later confessed that he wanted the hug, as he feared it may be our last.\n\n(Image: MDM)\n\nWhat a thing for my beautiful nine-year-old son to be thinking. Heartbreaking.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before he was taken to theatre, Max was given some medication, to help to detach him from the reality, nerves and outright worry of the situation.\n\nWe knew that it caused Max to become a little manic. We had been assured that he would not remember this \u2013 and he doesn't \u2013 but it was distressing to watch.\n\nCrying, laughing, shouting out or lying quietly; a veritable gamut of contrasting behaviours were teased out by this amnesia-inducing cocktail.\n\nThere is some footage which shows Max lying quietly on his bed as we began the move to theatre. It tugs at the heartstrings like little else. In those few seconds of footage, you see a small boy who looks scared, lost and so gut-wrenchingly \u00advulnerable... again.\n\nWhen he was taken to surgery for his heart pump, called LVAD (Left Ventricular \u00adAssist Device) to be fitted, Max didn\u2019t truly appreciate what was about to happen to him; how could he?\n\nNow, though, he had a frame of reference and the enormity of what he was about to go through was not lost on him.\n\nBy this stage, Max was singing at full tilt, My Heart Skips a Beat by Olly Murs.\n\nThe irony was not lost on us. Both Emma and I fought back our tears \u2013 it was so hard \u2013 but we didn\u2019t want to give Max any cause for additional worry.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the doors opened and we made our way along the sterile corridor and into the same theatre Max had been in for his LVAD operation.\n\nI noticed four very discreet cameras positioned around the operating table and saw again the machine that would keep Max alive \u2013 this time when his chest didn\u2019t have a heart in it.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nAs before, the anaesthetic was administered slowly.\n\nIncredibly, just before he fell asleep, Max became completely lucid, and perhaps in a moment of scared realisation, said: \u201cIt will be a while until I see you again. I love you both.\u201d \u201cWe love you too, Max,\u201d and as we said this, his beautiful eyes closed and he was gone.\n\nI kissed his \u00adforehead, whispered to him that I loved him and turned to leave the theatre. As I walked through the double doors and away from Max, I let out a doleful cry and tears cascaded down my cheeks.\n\nI knew that there was a 20% chance that I would never see Max again \u2013 I had lived with these Damoclean odds for months \u2013 but the reality of that situation and what it meant floored me. I felt sick, overwhelmed with grief. Please, God, bring him home.\n\nI sat and slowly regained my composure. Emma, too, had found the experience as challenging as I. To the left of me were\n\n(Image: xxxxxxxxxxx)\n\nbags of O-negative blood, with Max\u2019s name on them.\n\nNot only had some hero donated the organ of a loved one; other heroes had taken time to give lifesaving blood. Without them, this operation would not be taking place.\n\nAs ever, the staff team were so kind, arms around shoulders and kind words, \u201cGet out of here and try to relax. We\u2019ll call you if we need you.\u201d\n\nIt was 12.15am when the phone rang \u2013 exactly the time the transplant co-ordinator had said it would.\n\nWe climbed the stairs to the Paediatric Intensive Care and our little boy, and sat down, waiting for the surgeon and nurses to come and brief us.\n\nIn walked the surgeon. In his lilting Italian tone, Fabrizio informed us that the \u00adoperation had gone well, that the heart was good and that everything had gone to plan. I waited for the \u201cbut\u201d... surely, there must be a \u201cbut\u201d! Not on this occasion.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nThe next 24 hours would be critical, but as we sat in that room at around twenty to one in the morning, it seemed that we had much to be cautiously \u00adoptimistic about.\n\nUpon being shown into Max\u2019s cubicle, the \u00adenormity of the situation hit home. We had been told that his chest may be open, or that he may be on the ECMO machine.\n\nNeither possibility was welcome, \u00adespecially the latter, as this would mean that the new heart was not working properly and needed help; if this were the case, then the sands of time were made up of an \u00adalarmingly small number of grains.\n\nThankfully, Max\u2019s chest was closed. He had a breathing tube coming out of the right corner of his mouth.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nHis chest and abdomen were covered with wires \u2013 some with which we were entirely familiar, yet others, like his \u201cpacing wires\u201d (or \u201cjump leads\u201d as we called them) were clearly new and specific to the \u00adoperation he had had.\n\nMax just looked really pale, so fragile and beaten \u2013 for one so young, having been through such an ordeal.\n\nAs we left, I looked at the notice board on the wall in the cubicle. On it was written Max\u2019s name in shadow writing and underneath it, was a heart with a little arrow through it.\n\nBeneath was the signature of the artist \u2013 the surgeon, Fabrizio, who had \u00adtransplanted our son.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins / Daily Mirror)\n\nIn that moment, the sheer majesty and beauty of the care Max was under became so clear in my mind \u2013 in the months that he had been in hospital, the nameless acts of kindness and love bestowed by all of the staff had made the essence of his care somehow greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nUnderpinning all of this was a thought that struck me as I watched Max\u2019s chest, rising and falling in time with his ventilator and it has stayed with me ever since.\n\nSomewhere, possibly in Europe, but almost certainly in the UK, was a family grieving for the loss of a priceless child, who had made all of this possible; whose humanity and courage at the darkest, coldest and saddest time in their lives had given our son a chance of life.\n\nTheir child\u2019s \u201cGolden Heart\u201d was now beating in Max\u2019s chest, a part of him and a part of us... it is thanks to them that we were standing next to our son who now had a future, but there were times when we honestly thought we would never make it.", "description": "Max Johnson was at the centre of The Mirror\u2019s Change the Law for Life campaign that led to a change in the country's organ donation law", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Image", "Andy Commins", "Daily Mirror", "Mdm", "Xxxxxxxxxxx"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20648221.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Heart-transplant-patient-Max-Johnson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
