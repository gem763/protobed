Furman redshirt freshman quarterback Darren Grainger also is adept at throwing the ball.\n\nGrainger threw for 311 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions last week in a 48-42 loss at Georgia State, which was coming off a stunning opening weekend 38-30 victory against Tennessee.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar challenge from a different opponent for the Hokies after Atlantic Coast Conference foe Georgia Tech has changed its offense following Johnson\u2019s retirement.\n\n\u201cI watched the film last night and their quarterback is playing at an incredible level,\u201d Hokies fourth-year coach Justin Fuente said of Grainger. \u201cHe runs it, throws it, and then the triple-option spreads you out.\n\n\u201cThey do a little bit of everything. I was even more shocked to learn he\u2019s a redshirt freshman.\u201d\n\nFuente has experience with Furman coach Clay Hendrix, who objects to his offense being labeled as a triple-option because while they employ that style, they also do numerous other things in the course of a game.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see us as a triple-option team by any stretch,\u201d said Hendrix, who spent a decade as an assistant at Air Force. \u201cIt\u2019s part of who I am, it\u2019s part of who we\u2019re going to be whether it\u2019s triple-, whether it\u2019s double- - find a way to force somebody to be option sound, and then having the ability to throw off of it. \u2026 I think our strength is we are pretty multiple in what we do and we certainly have shown that we can throw the football.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had the option and everything else; that\u2019s a totally different animal that we got to be prepared for,\u201d said Fuente, who coached against Hendrix when Fuente was at TCU and Hendrix was an assistant at the academy.\n\nDefensively, the Paladins have been challenged, allowing an average of 517.5 yards per game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to tackle better. We\u2019ve just got the do the things that we have total control over, being where we\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d he said, noting that when things get difficult, \u201cwe start trying to do someone else\u2019s job.\n\n\u201cWe start trying to do too much and the next thing, we\u2019re not doing our job very well.\u201d\n\nThey will likely have to do their jobs better on Saturday.\n\nHere are some other things to watch for when Furman visits Virginia Tech:\n\nGRIND IT OUT\n\nVirginia Tech has averaged just 114.5 yards rushing per game, a figure that will have to improve to balance things and make it easier on quarterback Ryan Willis. Furman seems like a good opponent to help it happen.\n\nThe Paladins\u2019 Devin Wynn is averaging 107 rushing yards by himself through two games.\n\nNEED\n\nWith two FCS opponents - they play Rhode Island on Oct. 12, the Hokies have two FCS foes on their schedule after dispatching East Carolina from the slate following a dispute last season. Only one victory in such games counts toward the Hokies\u2019 bowl eligibility, and with a nation\u2019s best string of 26 straight bowls, they need this.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nThe Paladins\u2019 incorporation of triple- and double-option sets in their repertoire make them challenging for any opponent, and the added threat of passing effectively out of those formations could make them dangerous.\n\nINTANGIBLES\n\nTeams that are overmatched on paper typically make headlines with a mix of special teams and defensive plays that lead to easy scores. Do the Paladins have a \u2018Beamerball\u2019 performance in their arsenal?\n\nWHERE\u201dS GORDON\n\nThe Hokies would do well to pay attention to WR Thomas Gordon, who has caught 13 passes for 216 yards through two games. He\u2019s got just one touchdown, but will definitely be a focal point of the young Grainger.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Virginia Tech is once again game-planning to defend the triple option, only this time is not against Paul Johnson and Georgia Tech - it's Furman.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Hank Kurz Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/old_dominion_virginia_tech_football_58958_c0-290-3000-2039_s1770x1032.jpg?e216325a081b785a0530128513ccce63c3c5c0e3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
