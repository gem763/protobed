As Dina Asher-Smith explained yesterday, the post-Doha normalisation process will first involve a holiday and then some amateur interior design.\n\n\u2018There is a lot of purple in the team hotel and I want to put some in my living room,\u2019 she said, speaking on the morning after she became the first British athlete in history to take three medals at a World Championship.\n\nShe went on: \u2018I was taking pictures of the coffee shop here in the hotel and I wanted to make my kitchen look like it.\n\nDina Asher-Smith has taken her performances up a notch after a fantastic week in Doha\n\nThe British sprinter won one gold and two silvers in her events after a prolific week on the track\n\n\u2018I was sending all these pictures of the blues and purples to my mum.\u2019\n\nTrivial details, really, but the distraction once she gets back to her home in Kent will be no bad thing. The IAAF\u2019s president Seb Coe has already identified her as one of the poster figures of next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAnd based on the raised profile she experienced in 2018 after three gold medals at European level, this weightier haul of a gold and two silvers can be expected to take her up another few notches.\n\nWhile there were no obvious signs earlier this year of her resenting the attention that came from her Berlin wins, there tends to come a point when it is burdensome.\n\nLord Coe has described the 23-year-old as one of the poster figures of the 2020 Tokyo games\n\nOlympic years have a habit of hastening that process for athletes, let alone gold medal-winning sprinters, and how she responds in the next nine months could be a significant factor in her results at Tokyo 2020.\n\nShe touched on that subject yesterday ahead of returning to her flat for four days ahead of a holiday from Friday.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t been on social media so much so I haven\u2019t seen too much of the reaction,\u2019 she said. \u2018But I have mixed emotions about it. You guys have known me for ages and I am not one to be like, \u201cLook at me\u201d because I am not that kind of person.\n\n\u2018It is one of the things that I have had to deal with \u2014 the extra attention and people wanting selfies.\n\nAsher-Smith won silver in the 4x100m relay with Asha Philip, Ashleigh Nelson and Daryll Neita\n\n\u2018That is one of the big areas of personal improvement, getting comfortable with a higher profile, because that is not why I came into the sport. I like to run.\u2019\n\nThe topic of expectations has recurred across the past month, even before her 100m silver, 200m gold and the 4x100m silver she won with Asha Philip, Ashleigh Nelson and Daryll Neitta on Saturday.\n\nIt had been notable before and during these championships how Asher-Smith reduced her interaction with the press and cited it as a means of limiting the noise around her.\n\nWhile it\u2019s questionable whether that succeeded in capping the pressure on the 23-year-old, it is undisputable that she again exceeded predictions in Qatar.\n\nIt is on the track where she will be judged and currently all tests are being resoundingly passed.\n\nAlong with her relay team-mates and Katarina Johnson- Thompson, whose heptathlon gold was the standout result in the British set-up, it was a championship where the women vastly outshone the men.\n\nAsher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson were the standout British performers in Doha\n\nAsher-Smith said: \u2018I\u2019m happy we\u2019re getting positive things because it\u2019s been like \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be...?\u201d\n\n\u2018They are valid questions but it\u2019s always with a negative slant and you\u2019re like \u201cWe\u2019re just doing our jobs\u201d.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re training just as hard and going out there and winning medals.\u2019\n\nIt was Asher-Smith\u2019s 4x100m team-mate Ashleigh Nelson who best moved that point on yesterday, saying: \u2018Women shy away from being strong women. If a man is strong and independent that\u2019s great but if it\u2019s a women she\u2019s a bit of a b****.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s amazing that women\u2019s sport is motivating young women, because the drop-out rate is very high. I hope we can motivate young women to come through to take part.\n\n\u2018Just imagine in 10 to 20 years, if there\u2019s no-one doing it then this legacy will go to waste.\u2019", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN DOHA: While there were no obvious signs earlier this year of her resenting the attention that came from her Berlin wins, there tends to come a point when it is burdensome.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/18/19366978-0-image-a-7_1570384526891.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
