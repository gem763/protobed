More\n\nThe question caused Phoenix to mutter \"why would you\u2026? No\u2026 no,\" to the interviewer before walking out \u2013 only to return an hour later after the journalist did some 'peace-brokering with a Warner Bros PR'.\n\nExplaining his response, Phoenix said that the question hadn't crossed his mind before and then asked what an intelligent answer would have sounded like.\n\nPhoenix appears to have a habit of walking off, as Joker director Todd Phillips recently revealed he'd frequently leave the set in the middle of shooting scenes.\n\nPhoto credit: Niko Tavernise - Warner Bros. More\n\n\"In the middle of the scene, he'll just walk away and walk out,\" he explained. \"And the poor other actor thinks it's them and it was never them.\n\n\"It was always him, and he just wasn't feeling it.\"\n\n\n\nPhillips added that Phoenix would then take a breather and come back to set, ready to try again.\n\nJoker has a release date of October 4 in the US.\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "He wasn't laughing.", "authors": ["Stephanie Chase"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WFl4W2SEgAdMmeKJRio0eQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_mens_health_171/8151895a2847c3dc7ea7f86a2052e8a2", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
