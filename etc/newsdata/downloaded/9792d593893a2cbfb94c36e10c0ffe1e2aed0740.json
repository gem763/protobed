Zelenskiy agreed to Trump's requests, according to the memo.\n\nTrump made the request after withholding nearly $400 million in security aid approved by Congress to help Ukraine fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nVindman, who as a Ukraine specialist listened to the Trump-Zelenskiy call, told lawmakers on Tuesday the readout of the conversation released by the White House left out information he had sought to include, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe rough transcript left out an assertion by Trump that there were recordings of Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine and Zelenskiy's explicit mention of Burisma, the Times said, citing three people familiar with his testimony.\n\nMore witnesses are expected later this week, including Timothy Morrison, the National Security Council Senior Director for Europe and Russia, on Thursday and Robert Blair, a senior adviser to acting White House chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, on Friday.\n\nThe House is expected to vote this week on the formal process of moving forward with the impeachment inquiry after Republicans criticized the process as unfair to Trump.\n\nTrump has urged his allies to directly tackle the allegations against him.\n\n\"This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax,\" he tweeted Wednesday morning, urging Republicans to \"go with Substance and close it out!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle and Mark Hosenball; Writing by Susan Heavey, Editing by Timothy Heritage)", "description": "Two U.S. State Department officials will testify before House of Representatives investigators in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump on Wednesday while lawmakers prepare to weigh rules formalizing the impeachment process ahead.
