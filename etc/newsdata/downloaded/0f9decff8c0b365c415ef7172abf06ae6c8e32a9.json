Overall, sentiment this month remains cautious regarding near-term growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have now tariffed our way into a manufacturing recession in the U.S. and globally,\u201d Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, told CNBC. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost more than 250 points.\n\nThe new data also put a damper on recent reports that suggested manufacturing was making a comeback, as IHS Markit\u2019s final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index showed a rebound to 51.1 percent in September, the highest number in the last five months.\n\n\u201cNews of the PMI hitting a five-month high brings a sigh of relief, but manufacturing is not out of the woods yet,\u201d Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, reacted in a statement.\n\nPresident Trump blamed the low numbers on the Federal Reserve and chairman Jay Powell in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nAs I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don\u2019t have a clue. Pathetic! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data also comes in the midst of President Trump\u2019s strenuous use of tariffs to bring China to the negotiating table, a strategy largely opposed by U.S. business leaders. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that, in the midst of impeachment fervor, China could use the president\u2019s potential vulnerability as leverage in any trade discussions.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A gauge of the U.S. manufacturing sector released Tuesday showed that the month of September featured the largest contraction in the sector in more than ten years, due largely to the deleterious effect that Trump's trade war has had on exports.The report, released by the Institute for Supply Management", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1aZ8ywKPobn0CWyv23vHEQ--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/3d43446bb421190e69deffa0dde30181"}
