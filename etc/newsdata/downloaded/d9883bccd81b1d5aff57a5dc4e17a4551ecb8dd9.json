Shape Created with Sketch. 47 brilliant films that didn't receive a single Oscar nomination 1/47 American Psycho (2000) Starring future Oscar-winner Christian Bale, Mary Harron\u2019s adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel \u2013 in which the Vice star plays the psychopathic Patrick Bateman - didn\u2019t receive a single nomination. Rex Features 2/47 Before Sunrise (1995) While the final two chapters of Richard Linklater\u2019s Before\u2026 trilogy earned screenplay nominations, the film that introduced the world to future married couple Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) was criminally overlooked. Columbia Pictures 3/47 The Big Heat (1953) Fritz Lang had a number of films overlooked by the Academy; this noir, starring Glenn Ford, Lee Marvin and and Gloria Grahame, was one of them. Columbia Pictures 4/47 The Big Lebowski (1998) The Academy\u2019s generosity to the Coen brothers peaked when No Country for Old Men beat There Will Be Blood in one of the ceremony\u2019s closest Best Picture races of all time. It remains surprising that one of their few films to evade any nominations is this endlessly quotable mistaken identity comedy starring Jeff Bridges as The Dude. PolyGram Filmed Entertainment 5/47 Blow Out (1981) Brian De Palma doesn\u2019t exactly make films in the hope of winning award, but his political thriller - based on Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s Blow Up \u2013 would have deserved any Oscar it was nominated for. Filmways Pictures 6/47 Breathless (1960) Breathless' failure to receive a nomination is proof that the Oscars can\u2019t be trusted. Despite being one of the most studied films in the world, Jean Luc-Godard\u2019s French masterpiece has an Academy Award tally of zero. Films Around The World 7/47 Bringing Up Baby (1938) The Academy rewarded many notable screwball comedies, though this Howard Hawks-directed standout starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn - who\u2019d go on to hold the record for most wins - wasn't one of them. Courtesy of BFI 8/47 Don't Look Now (1973) Nicolas Roeg, who directed this Venice-set chiller, is one of the most unfairly overlooked directors in Oscars history. Rex Features 9/47 Donnie Darko (2004) Richard Kelly\u2019s science-fiction mind-bender, which made a star of Jake Gyllenhaal, was a festival favourite upon its debut in 2004. Many expected a screenplay nomination to manifest. Rex Features 10/47 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) It wouldn\u2019t be until the 1990s that western films found favour with the Academy. It was ironically thanks to Unforgiven, a film directed by Clint Eastwood whose career flourished after starring in this Sergio Leone film that many consider to be the genre\u2019s peak. 11/47 La haine (1995) Mathieu Kassovitz\u2019s black-and-white drama \u2013 translated in English as Hate \u2013 follows three young friends and their struggles living in the suburbs of Paris. 12/47 Halloween (1978) The Academy may not be frothing at the mouth to nominate horror films, but do have previous (see: The Exorcist and The Silence of the Lamb), which makes the absence of John Carpenter\u2019s influential Halloween a glaring oversight. Aquarius Releasing 13/47 Harold and Maude (1971) This offbeat romantic drama was a critical and commercial flop at the time of release, which probably accounts for its lack of Oscar nominations. Today, though, it\u2019s cult following ensures it remains in good favour with film fans. Paramount Pictures 14/47 Heat (1995) On paper, the big screen union of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in Michael Mann\u2019s cop drama was a shoo-in for awards, but no Oscar nominations manifested. Warner Bros 15/47 His Girl Friday (1940) Yet another Howard Hawks screwball comedy starring Cary Grant that criminally failed to secure a single Oscar nomination. L/Columbia/Koba/Rex/Shutterstock 16/47 Insomnia (2002) While falling short of Christopher Nolan\u2019s best, modest drama Insomnia \u2013 made years before Batman Begins \u2013 had enough strong performances (Al Pacino, Robin Wiliams, Hilary Swank) to warrant acting nominations. Alas, it received none. Warner Bros Pictures 17/47 Local Hero (1983) Bill Forsyth\u2019s beloved comedy-drama follows the mishaps of an American man sent to buy up a Scottish village where the oil company he works for wants to build a refinery. Forsyth won the Bafta for Best Director, but the film received no such love from the Academy. 20th Century Fox 18/47 M (1931) You\u2019d be mistaken for thinking the \u201cM\u201d stands for \u201cmasterpiece\u201d in Fritz Lang\u2019s German drama that follows the manhunt for a serial killer - not that the Academy agreed. 20th Century Fox 19/47 A Man Escaped (1956) Robert Bresson\u2019s adaptation of Andr\u00e9 Devigny\u2019s memoirs charts the French Resistance member\u2019s time as prisoner of the Germans during World War II, and is even more enthralling considering Bresson himself was held captive years before. Gaumont Film Company 20/47 Margaret (2011) Kenneth Lonergan would go on to win an Oscar for Manchester but he Sea, but Margaret - his three-hour plus drama featuring a searing performance from Anna Paquin - failed to secure a single nomination. Fox Searchlight Pictures 21/47 In the Mood for Love (2000) Wong Kar-wai set the benchmark for romance in film with his acclaimed Hong Kong drama following a man and woman (Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung) who develop feelings for one another after suspecting their respective spouses of having an affair together. defd Deutscher Fernsehdienst 22/47 The King of Comedy (1982) It may have taken him decades to win an Oscar, but the Academy has rarely balked at nominating Martin Scorsese films \u2013 especially for films starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy was an exception. 20th Century Fox 23/47 The Long Goodbye (1973) Robert Altman\u2019s superior thriller stars Elliott Gould as Raymond Chandler\u2019s private investigator Philip Marlowe in one of the director\u2019s most entertaining films. The director would go on to be the recipient of the Honorary Award in 2006. 24/47 The Man With Two Brains (1983) He may have hosted several times, but Steve Martin has never been nominated for an Oscar. One film he deserved recognition for was Carl Reiner's 1983 sci-fi comedy, The Man with Two Brains. Warner Bros. 25/47 A Matter of Life and Death (1946) The Academy Film Archive may have preserved A Matter of Life and Death in 1999, but voters failed to recognise the Powell & Pressburger\u2019s fantasy-romance at the time of its release in 1946. Eagle-Lion Films 26/47 Mean Streets (1973) It may not be credited as his debut, but Mean Streets is very much the first true Martin Scorsese film. The director would go on to win a belated Oscar for The Departed in 2007, but he\u2019d have to wait until 1975 for his first nomination (Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore). Warner Bros 27/47 Melancholia (2011) No Lars von Trier film has ever been nominated for Best Picture, though Dancer in the Dark came close (it settled for a Best Original Song nomination). He came close with Melancholia, but ultimately, the drama didn't get Canal+ 28/47 Miller's Crossing (1990) Despite being revered as a Coen brothers favourite, not to mention its notable performances from Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, Miller\u2019s Crossing is one of few Coen brother films not to receive a single Oscar nomination. 20th Century Fox 29/47 Once Upon a Time in America (1984) Though it's by no means a masterpiece, it\u2019s staggering to think that Sergio Leone\u2019s gangster epic - starring Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci - didn\u2019t acquire any Oscar nominations (the film's music was disqualified from consideration after Warner Bros accidentally omitted the composer's name from the opening credits when trimming the film\u2019s lengthy running time for its American release). Warner Bros 30/47 Paterson (2016) Critics assumed Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson would have been a shoo-in for awards recognition - most notably in the Best Actor category, thanks to a quietly fantastic performance from Adam Driver - but no such luck. Amazon Studios 31/47 Paths of Glory (1957) Stanley Kubrick never won Best Director despite being nominated four times. One of his films that didn\u2019t make the Oscars cut in any category was his black-and-white anti-war film, Paths of Glory. United Artists 32/47 Play Misty for Me (1971) Clint Eastwood would go onto become something of an Oscar darling thanks to Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River, but his directorial debut was ignored by the Academy. Univeral Pictures/Courtesy of Getty Images 33/47 Reservoir Dogs (1992) Reservoir Dogs may not touch Quentin Tarantino\u2019s best, but it remains a surprise that the filmmaker\u2019s debut didn\u2019t get recognised in the screenplay category, at least. Miramax Films 34/47 The Rider (2018) Of all the 2018 films to be snubbed at this year\u2019s Oscars, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2019s drama - which stars a real-life rodeo cowboy and his family - smacks as the most unfair. Sony Pictures Classics 35/47 The Searchers (1956) The role of Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards might be considered John Wayne\u2019s best role, but the Academy didn\u2019t agree: he would win his sole Oscar for True Grit in 1970. Warner Bros 36/47 The Shining (1980) Another Kubrick film that was completely ignored by the Academy is the director\u2019s Stephen King adaptation, The Shining. Today, it\u2019s considered one of his finest works as well as being one of the most revered horror films of all time. Warner Bros 37/47 The Shop Around the Corner (1953) It may have endured as one of the best loved romcoms of all time, but it has zero Oscar nominations to its name. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 38/47 Still Walking (2008) Japanese director Hirokazo Kore-eda's portrait of a family over roughly 24 hours as they commemorate the death of the eldest son was a glaring oversight by the Academy. IFC Films 39/47 Swingers Before he became Disney's go to, Jon Favreau (Iron Man, The Jungle Book and the forthcoming live-action Lion King) wrote this independent film about the lives of single, unemployed actors living in Hollywood, California during the 1990s swing revival. Rex Features 40/47 This Is England (2006 The 2007 ceremony would have been far better had Shane Meadows' coming-of-drama been in contention for awards. Optimum Releasing 41/47 Three Kings (1999) The Academy deemed Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle worthy of nominations, but not David O Russell\u2019s Three Kings, which remains one of his greatest films to this day. Warner Bros Pictures 42/47 Tokyo Story (1953) Tokyo Story is deemed Japanese filmmaker Yasujir\u014d Ozu's masterpiece and was named Sight & Sound's best film of all time in 2012. Rex Features 43/47 Touch of Evil (1958) Orson Welles' classic noir wasn't as well loved at the time of release as it is today. BFI 44/47 Tyrannosaur (2011) Olivia Colman may be in contention for Best Actress at this year\u2019s ceremony, but the fact she failed to earn a nomination (or Bafta, for that matter) for her role in Paddy Considine\u2019s hard-hitting drama Tyrannosaur is one of the biggest oversights in awards history. StudioCanal UK 45/47 Walkabout (1971) Another exceptional achievement in filmmaking from Nicolas Roeg that somehow failed to receive any Oscar nominations. 46/47 You Were Never Really Here (2018) Notch it down to bad timing, but Lynne Ramsay\u2019s You Were Never Really Here - starring Joaquin Phoenix - is a sensational piece of work worthy of reward. Amazon Studio 47/47 Zodiac (2007) Three years later, David Fincher would go head-to-head with The King Speech's Tom Hooper for The Social Network. In truth, serial killer drama Zodiac is every bit as good as the Facebook drama. Warner Bros Pictures 1/47 American Psycho (2000) Starring future Oscar-winner Christian Bale, Mary Harron\u2019s adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel \u2013 in which the Vice star plays the psychopathic Patrick Bateman - didn\u2019t receive a single nomination.
