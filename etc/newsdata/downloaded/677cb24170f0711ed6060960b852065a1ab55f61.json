Howard Dean, a 2004 presidential candidate. \u201cCash is the biggest, most important metric that tells us who can really compete and who can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSanders leads the field in cash on hand with $33.7 million, followed by Warren with $25.7 million. But after Buttigieg ($23.4 million), there is a steep drop-off to the next highest campaign account. Harris has $10.5 million on hand, followed by Biden. No other Democrat had more than $7 million in the bank at the end of the third quarter, and most of them are already spending faster than they are raising money \u2014 without even running a major TV ad campaign yet.\n\nOutside the top candidates, the cash crunch puts pressure on an already shrinking field to narrow further. Some candidates, assuming fundraising would be better, \u201cbuilt a house they can\u2019t pay for\u201d in the early states, said Doug Herman, a Democratic consultant who is unaffiliated in the presidential primary.\n\n\u201cIt leaves them with enough money to continue, but not enough money to change anything about their future,\u201d Herman said. \u201cThey won\u2019t have the ad budgets for when it matters.\u201d\n\nIndeed, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro burned 91 percent of the money he raised in the third quarter, leaving him with just $670,000 in the bank. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke used up 81 percent of his total and has $3.3 million left over, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar burned 79 percent of hers, leaving just $3.7 million in the bank. None of the three has qualified yet for the next Democratic debate in November.\n\n\u201cWith so many candidates in this race, making it so much more difficult to have a breakout moment, money in the bank is even more important than ever before,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, Polk County Democratic Party chairman.\n\nFailure to break out of the pack already proved lethal for a handful of candidates during the third quarter. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Seth Moulton, Rep. Eric Swalwell and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio all dropped out of the presidential race last quarter, and their financial reports show that many of them simply ran out of money while trying to make a splash in the crowded 2020 election.\n\n\u201cPolling and money go hand in hand because candidates who are out front raising the most money are polling the best, which then helps them raise more money,\u201d said Jefrey Pollock, a Democratic pollster who advised Gillibrand\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s usually the case, but it\u2019s particularly true this cycle, and it makes breaking into that top tier extremely difficult \u2014 even more so this late into it.\u201d\n\nFundraising isn\u2019t a problem for the quarter\u2019s biggest spender, billionaire Tom Steyer, who spent $47 million on his bid, almost entirely from his own bank account.\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang also stood out in his fundraising haul, bringing in nearly $10 million last quarter, easily topping some longtime members of Congress. He\u2019s sitting on $6.8 million in cash on hand.\n\nThe quarterly filings also cast new light on an ongoing debate within the Democratic Party about how candidates should raise money, and from whom. Earlier this week, Warren attacked her Democratic rivals for \u201chobnobbing with the rich\u201d and called on them to publicly disclose their bundlers and their private fundraising schedules.\n\nWarren and Sanders have both eschewed traditional high-dollar private fundraising events, and Warren recently pledged to no longer accept contributions over $200 from executives at \u201cbig tech companies, big banks, private equity firms or hedge funds.\u201d Warren and Sanders haven\u2019t suffered from their decision to reject traditional fundraising in the primary, relying instead on high-octane online fundraising. But Buttigieg warned that Democrats can\u2019t beat President Donald Trump \u201cwith pocket change\u201d and the party needs \u201cthe full spectrum of support in order to compete.\u201d\n\nBut Sanders and Warren\u2019s online success is a measure of where the party is going, said Bagniewski. \u201cIf I had to pick between ActBlue and the DNC\u2019s megadonor list, I\u2019d pick ActBlue every time,\u201d adding that the small-dollar fundraising platform \u201chas fundamentally changed the way we can raise money.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has also raised significant money online, but he, Biden and Harris have all leaned on high-dollar donors, too, frequently appearing at private fundraising events.\n\nAs Biden\u2019s campaign spending picked up over the summer, his reliance on maximum donors \u2014 who can only give once and are not a renewable campaign resource \u2014 meant that his fundraising could not keep pace. More than one-third of Biden\u2019s contributions came from maximum donors in the second quarter, and max-out donors comprised a similar portion of a smaller pie for Biden this quarter.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s campaign did appear to get a fundraising lift in the final 11 days of the quarter, after news broke Sept. 20 of a whistleblower complaint alleging that President Donald Trump improperly pressured Ukraine into investigating Biden and his son. The Biden campaign responded by fundraising aggressively off of the scandal, more than doubling its previous daily average donation total.\n\nAs the field narrows, Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is already eying bundlers for other candidates. On a call with members of its \u201cinvestors circle\u201d last week, Buttigieg staffers urged its top donors to start wooing bundlers for other campaigns, particularly those languishing in single digits, according to a Buttigieg donor.\n\n\u201cRight now, money is more important criteria for a candidate than your poll standing,\u201d Herman said. \u201cYou can change your poll standing with money, and you can\u2019t without it.\u201d\n\nMarc Caputo, Maggie Severns and Zach Montellaro contributed reporting.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ab/90/04562dee4f2fb8823a2dc16a99cd/191016-joe-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
