They weren\u2019t cruel \u2014 not really. More oafish and unnuanced and completely incurious about the world from anyone else\u2019s perspective. But then we saw the stats on police officers abusing their domestic partners (40 percent, wtf). And the utter breakdown in communication between police departments. And a court that just plumb doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s actually sending court dates to the right addresses. (Sorry for that warrant, Marie!) Let\u2019s not forget the incredibly charming Scott Parrish, who just rapes college ladies for funzies in his dorm room but walks away from charges because his daddy threatens to sue. Every single system, Unbelievable is saying, is deeply flawed, pockmarked and shredded into a pitted, pulpy mess. It\u2019s a rage-watch, something at which to aim all your anger about the brokenness of America and humanity. This is the death of the soul by a thousand bureaucratic cuts. And in this episode, we get a few more cuts courtesy of Lilly\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I can tell you that I didn\u2019t already tell Head Up His Ass Harkness a million times, but come on in,\u201d Lilly (Annaleigh Ashford, Tony Award winner and future Paula Jones in American Crime Story) says while welcoming Rasmussen into her house. Looking at her story is like trying to isolate a single color in a prism. She depicts it all so clearly. A masked intruder with a knife broke into her home. She dove off a second-floor balcony and onto a brick patio below to get away. She dragged her broken body (pelvis cracked, femur destroyed, ribs in bits) to get help, but really, not much help has been forthcoming.\n\nThe detective assigned to her case \u2014 real shocker here, another old dude \u2014 suddenly casts a whole new light on Lilly\u2019s perspective. He isn\u2019t some cartoon villain snickering with his face behind his hand and calling her a loon. Instead, he\u2019s the less explicit but still dangerous version of that, explaining to Duvall, \u201cI might have written her off entirely if not for her injuries.\u201d Why write off a woman who claims she was attacked? Well, because he thinks she\u2019s a little weird, which has been a smear against women since Salem officials locked up Tituba for making a \u201cwitch cake.\u201d It\u2019s an insidious thing, really, to think women are silly. To snicker to a fellow (female) cop that \u201csince the attack, her cat had been scratching people wearing black boots. She thought that was an important lead.\u201d To question if her assault was imagined, since she partakes of an herbal sedative. The subtext is so clear it practically showed up on the closed captioning: LADIES BE DOING SILLY SHIT.\n\nCoincidentally, Lilly\u2019s theory of who might have attacked her lines up with Rasmussen\u2019s. \u201cThey\u2019d do it if it was one of them,\u201d she says, meaning the cops might be protecting their own. It\u2019s titillating, right? This woman who claims to speak to friends through the ether, who worships a Spirit most of us find mystical, is also saying Rasmussen and Duvall are on the right track, as if she were divining the truth in this whole mess. \u201cNothing is unknowable,\u201d she reminds Rasmussen \u2014 which is either a philosophical treatise or a swift kick in the ass. Perhaps both.\n\nThe physical evidence from Lilly\u2019s house bolsters the team members\u2019 work too, since they can confirm the shoe prints and glove prints match those found at Amber\u2019s house. There is now definitive proof that these cases are linked.\n\nMore investigating commences. (And there is a case to be made here that Unbelievable is not ideal for bingeing \u2014 in isolation, these paperwork scavenger hunts are fascinating, but happening in episode after episode may dull that pleasure.) But the glorious intern whose name I absolutely can\u2019t recall ever being told really steps in it by mentioning that perhaps everyone should tailor their ViCAP targets to include members of law enforcement. (Sidenote: You can be an intern for these types of detectives? Yes, please.) Taggert must be reading my recaps, because he wisely notes that citizens, not just cops, would know how to wipe down a room and wash away DNA evidence. \u201cCSI has turned a generation of American TV viewers into crime-scene experts,\u201d he explains. The textbook (Rape Investigation Handbook) Duvall is later given by the Kansas detective only cements this theory. It sounds likely that a cop committed these rapes, but it\u2019s also possible one of those dark-web parasites got his mitts on a copy of this book and put it to disturbingly good use.\n\nOf course, Rasmussen\u2019s breakdown isn\u2019t entirely due to Taggert\u2019s (understandable) counterpoints. She has been reading the literature, and holy hell, it isn\u2019t good. And nobody is matching her outrage on this. Duvall demonstrates her dismay in a much lower key with more sadness than anger. But they\u2019re up against a serial rapist and their FBI contact once called him \u201cgarden-variety horrible\u201d and nobody is screaming or yelling and male cops are essentially getting away with both shoddy work and beating their wives and everyone is just casually sitting around a table, passing notes and digging into Chinese food like this is an ordinary job. I get her rage, and most of you probably do too. All these system breakdowns and small failures add up to a colossal miscarriage of justice for the thousands of women raped each year. The conversation Duvall and Rasmussen have outside that conference room is one a lot of us have had over the past few years. We\u2019re pissed and ready to smash up this shitty system, but we don\u2019t know exactly how to do it \u2014 or why everyone else isn\u2019t onboard. If a study came out saying 30 percent of female cops hit their kids, then yes, they\u2019d all lose their jobs. The scales of Justice are so lopsided it\u2019s a wonder she can stand. But as Duvall points out, \u201cYou sitting out here, screaming into the wind, does nothing to unfuck it.\u201d\n\nAnd lo and behold, they get a ViCAP hit that sends Duvall on a trip to Kansas to dig up any info she can on a rape that sounds indubitably like their own. All around the kitchen cock-a-doodle-doodle-doo! She turns up eight years of files and uses her badge to scare the bejesus out of one of those \u201cgarden variety\u201d pervs who make women uncomfortable for merely operating in a public space. I hope he goes home that night and shits himself in terror.\n\n(I also hope the intern\u2019s panty-theft idea goes somewhere. If I noticed my window ajar and some underwear gone, I would sure as hell call the police. But I do love the flummoxed stares from Rosemarie and Rasmussen when the only dude in the room chimes in with \u201cI had a thought!\u201d)\n\nIf Marie has been managing to keep most of her feelings bottled up since her attack, that calm visage is now slipping. Those thousand paper cuts are coming for her, too \u2014 she has been moved to the loading dock at work with nary a kind word from her boss, intimidated by yet another creep who uses his looming height and innuendo to suggest he just might have a little fun raping her, and then given a sensible talk by Connor when the last thing Marie wants is to be sensible.\n\nThe loneliness of her situation is compounded by the conversation between Duvall and Amber outside the detective\u2019s church. Marie hasn\u2019t just been abandoned and disbelieved; she\u2019s now being actively pursued for criminal charges. Even with support and love from friends, Amber is, as she puts it, \u201closing [her] mind,\u201d suddenly acting entirely out of character, buying a gun and sleeping with strange men. All the support in the world won\u2019t suddenly heal a trauma like hers, but Duvall\u2019s reassurance is a start. (It\u2019s an especially nice touch that the women are dressed so similarly \u2014 both have on black pants, a dark floral shirt, a black purse slung over their shoulder \u2014 like a visual sign of their kinship.) So try to imagine what Marie, now jobless, friendless, broke, and emotionally kneecapped, is keeping under that steely expression.\n\nWe, of course, know the case is inching along. That Colleen believes Marie\u2019s account enough to tip off a detective. That Rasmussen has a lead on James Massey, a tall, strong, blue-eyed cop who sounds an awful lot like a good fit for these rapes. But Marie is years in the past, quite alone, and entirely unknown to the only two women who care enough to do all the legwork.", "description": "The case is inching along, but Marie is years in the past, quite alone, and entirely unknown to the only women who care enough to do the legwork.
