And you don\u2019t get much more toasty than the classic chicken variety: simple, yet unfeasibly sustaining, and as clean and light as it is satisfying. No freezer should be without it.\n\nPrep 10 min\n\nCook 2\u00bd hr\n\nServes 6\n\n1kg chicken wings or drumsticks (or a mixture), plus a leftover chicken carcass, if you happen to have one\n\n2 sticks celery\n\n2 onions\n\n3 leeks\n\n3 carrots\n\n1 small bunch parsley, separated into stalks and leaves\n\n750ml chicken stock\n\n175g pearl barley\n\nSalt and pepper\n\n1 Drumsticks, wings or a whole bird?\n\nPut the chicken in a large stock pot \u2013 I prefer wings and drumsticks, because they yield a lot of bang per buck flavourwise, but you could use a whole bird and add some of the meat to the broth at the end (save the rest of the cooked meat for another meal). This is also a good place to stick a roast chicken carcass, to give your soup a bit of extra oomph.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wings and drumsticks yield the best flavour, but a whole bird will also do the trick.\n\n2 Boil and skim\n\nAdd enough cold water to the pot to cover the chicken entirely, then bring slowly to a boil. Skim off any froth that rises to the top \u2013 this is important, because it will taint the flavour of the finished soup, so don\u2019t be tempted to move on until you\u2019ve removed and discarded as much as possible.\n\nHow to make wild mushroom risotto \u2013 recipe | Felicity Cloake Read more\n\n3 Wash and chop the stock veg\n\nWhile the broth is simmering, wash and roughly chop the celery, onions, and two each of the leeks and carrots \u2013 there\u2019s no need to peel the onions or carrots unless they\u2019re dirty, or to be too precise with the chopping, because they\u2019re all going to be strained out once they\u2019ve given up their flavour, but do make sure there isn\u2019t any mud lurking in the folds of the leek.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Onions, carrots, celery and leeks make up the stock vegetables.\n\n4 Add the veg and simmer\n\nAdd the chopped veg to the skimmed pot with the parsley stalks and stock, then simmer for about two hours, stirring occasionally to make sure the aromatics are evenly distributed. Meanwhile, cook the barley in a pan of boiling water for 20-25 minutes, until tender, then drain. Peel the last carrot, and finely chop it and the remaining leek.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Add the vegetables to the pot and simmer for two hours.\n\n5 Strain, shred the meat and simmer again\n\nStrain the soup through a fine sieve and return the broth to the pot. Pick the meat off the chicken bones \u2013 bear in mind that if you\u2019re using wings and drumsticks, it will be rather tough, but it should still be pretty tasty \u2013 and add that to the pot. Discard the bones and everything in the sieve. Bring the soup back to a simmer, then add the chopped carrot and leek.\n\n6 Finishing touches\n\nCook for about 10 minutes more, until the vegetables are done to your liking, then stir in the cooked barley. While that\u2019s heating through, season the broth to taste. Divide it between bowls, then roughly chop the parsley leaves and scatter these on top before serving.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest When the vegetables are done, add the cooked barley.\n\n7 And if you\u2019d rather have dumplings \u2026\n\nIf you prefer dumplings to barley, instead of pre-cooking that in Step 4, mix 100g plain flour with a pinch of salt, a teaspoon of baking powder, 50g suet or grated butter and just enough cold water to make a dough. Roll into six dumplings, then add to the strained soup and cook for 15 minutes before adding the second batch of vegetables.\n\n8 \u2026 or an Asian flavour \u2026\n\nTo give the soup Asian notes, replace the parsley with coriander, and add a slit Thai chilli, a few slices of fresh ginger and a star anise when you put in the first batch of veg. Replace the barley with a block of rice noodles \u2013 just soften them in the hot strained soup \u2013 and top with chopped chilli, coriander and a wedge of lime.\n\n9 \u2026 or a creamy classic\n\nFor traditional cream of chicken soup, whisk 100ml double cream and an egg yolk in a small bowl. Once the soup is ready, take it off the heat and quickly beat in the cream mix. Check the seasoning again \u2013 I like a grating of nutmeg. You can top the soup with a sprinkling of chopped chives or tarragon leaves (in which case, use the stalks in Step 4) rather than parsley.", "description": "Forget the chilled soups and consomm\u00e9s of high summer; it\u2019s time to appreciate the heartier sort now that soup season proper is with us again", "authors": ["Felicity Cloake"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ab8c07f34999adb1ee500d0b1987273c227836/681_2016_6357_3814/master/6357.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ee65d22e708c5a62d355ba881e2721f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
