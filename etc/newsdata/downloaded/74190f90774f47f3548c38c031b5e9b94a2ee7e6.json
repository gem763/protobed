But Iowa State couldn\u2019t stop Baylor\u2019s 54-yard drive to the winning points while losing a Big 12 opener for the 16th time in 18 seasons - including all four under coach Matt Campbell.\n\nThe Bears fell behind for the first time this season on Purdy\u2019s 20-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Kolar with less than four minutes to go.\n\nCharlie Brewer answered with three third-down conversions on the 14-play march, which included completions of 15 and 13 yards to Tyquan Thornton. Mayers\u2019 kick into the wind was just inside the right post after he missed badly from the same distance - 38 yards - in the first half.\n\nBaylor was behind because of a botched PAT attempt after the second of three touchdown passes from Brewer when the snap went through holder Skyler Wetzel\u2019s hands.\n\nThornton had 11 catches for 141 yards and the last Baylor touchdown. Denzel Mims scored the first TDs and had 106 yards on six grabs.\n\nAfter a rough start, Purdy finished 27 of 45 for 342 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Johnnie Lang had a touchdown rushing and another receiving.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIowa State: Purdy\u2019s recovery a week after accounting for six touchdowns in a 72-20 loss to Louisiana-Monroe reversed what was looking like a miserable day. Still, the Cyclones will feel like they let one get away after they thought they had stolen one.\n\nBaylor: Instead of what would have been the worst loss under Rhule, the Bears have momentum in the Big 12 race. The Bears also avoided ending Rhule\u2019s 35-game winning streak when the coach\u2019s team was tied or leading going in the fourth quarter, including his Temple tenure.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa State: TCU at home next Saturday.\n\nBaylor: At Kansas State next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "John Mayers kicked a 38-yarder with 21 seconds left for the first field goal of the redshirt freshman's career, lifting Baylor to a 23-21 victory over Iowa State on Saturday after the Bears blew a 20-point lead in the fourth quarter.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Schuyler Dixon"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/iowa_state_baylor_football_64285_c0-172-3000-1921_s1770x1032.jpg?13092784dff4e53807a4960a7a8b145b195b5102", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
