REUTERS/ Gene Blevins/File Photo\n\nMindful of Southern California\u2019s vulnerability to fires and earthquakes, architect Richard Meier designed the $1.3 billion center with an array of special features to protect a collection that includes paintings by Van Gogh, Rembrandt and Manet, ancient Greek statues and an expansive array of manuscripts.\n\nBuilt in 1997 on a hilltop in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, about 13 miles (21 km) west of downtown, the center describes itself on its website as a \u201cmarvel of anti-fire engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe buildings are impervious to fire from the outside and they\u2019re constructed to be basically fire proof,\u201d said Lisa Lapin, spokeswoman for the Getty Trust, as a firefighting helicopter flew overhead.\n\n\u201cEvacuating the art would put it at greater danger. There\u2019s no need to move it, it\u2019s very, very safe,\u201d she said.\n\nBuildings on the center\u2019s campus, which house the J. Paul Getty Museum and other Getty Trust programs, are clad in stone and steel with stone rooftops that keep burning embers from igniting the structures.\n\nThe museum\u2019s galleries are double-walled and compartmentalized to prevent an interior fire spreading. They have systems that can recycle air to stop smoke and ash entering and remove oxygen from the air to extinguish any flames inside.\n\nSince Monday, a million-gallon water tank has allowed museum staff to irrigate grounds that act as a fire buffer zone around buildings, Lapin said by phone from the center.\n\nThe so-called Getty Fire had burned 656 acres (265 hectares) as of Tuesday afternoon, destroying eight homes and forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents, including celebrities such as NBA star LeBron James and actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nRelated Coverage Getty fire in LA likely caused by tree branch falling on power lines: fire officials\n\nThe flames have come within three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) of the Getty Center\u2019s office buildings, and a mile (1.6 km) from structures housing art, burning in a wildland area of the more than 600-acre complex, Lapin said.\n\nFirefighters are using the center as a rest area, eating at its caf\u00e9, and using it as a vantage point from which to manage their air attack, Lapin added.\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019ve extinguished all visible flames, we have countless smoldering hotspots and we have another severe wind event forecasted late tonight through Thursday,\u201d Los Angeles Fire Department spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said.", "description": "When a fast-moving wildfire licked up to the fringes of the sprawling Getty Center complex on Tuesday, the staff of the Los Angeles museum betrayed no sign of panic, confident that its priceless art was safe and secure within its walls.", "authors": ["Andrew Hay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446325994&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1YF", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
