We all know this government can\u2019t pass anything, we know all these promises are hollow electioneering, we know there will be an election very soon and everyone in parliament knows that we know all of that. What a tremendous waste of everyone\u2019s time. deGooder\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a funny thing when you realise you have more freedom than the Queen\u2019\n\nGood lord. She actually read that crap?! It\u2019s a funny thing when you realise you have more freedom and integrity than the Queen for a day! Daniel James\n\n\u2018It\u2019s time the UK joined the real world\u2019\n\nHow much lower can Johnson and his government sink? He\u2019s lied to and insulted the Queen and now he\u2019s using her to kick off his election campaign. The country is in chaos and on the brink of bringing the worst disaster since WWII upon itself and the focus is on a pageant? It\u2019s time the UK forgot its colonial past and ideas of \u201cwe rule the world\u201d and joined the real world! expatontour\n\n\u2018This makes Monty Python look like Panorama\u2019\n\nMy country must now be a laughing stock in the eyes of the world! This makes Monty Python look like Panorama! Barry Bennett\n\n\u2018They are using the Queen as a tool for their propaganda\u2019\n\nThis certainly is weird \u2013 a party that does not have a majority, whose leader has not won an election, at a point where there is very likely going to be another constitutional, and there\u2019s a Queen\u2019s Speech, as if nothing unusual was going on? The Tories are seriously taking the p*ss out of the monarchy. They are using her. There\u2019s no other way of describing it. Using the Queen as a tool for their propaganda. I hope she does something to upset their arrogance and complacency, like wearing an EU badge or blue and yellow shoes. Cyclist30mph\n\nPlay Video 1:17 Queen's speech: Brexit takes centre stage \u2013 video highlights\n\n\u2018Why is there no shame?\u2019\n\nYou know you are desperate when you feel sorry for the Queen being forced to slide around in Johnson\u2019s bullshit with Cummings lurking in the gloom. Why is there no shame at all? My daughter (year six) is doing a school trip to the houses of parliament next month. Why do I feel so ashamed to tell her about what the grown-ups have been getting up to in there? These people should think about the little children looking at their behaviour and saying \u201ccor\u201d to each other. My Race Is Human\n\n\u2018They\u2019re getting the Queen to announce a Tory manifesto\u2019\n\nOnce again the monarchy is allowing itself to be a political tool of Boris Johnson. This is becoming something of a habit. Much like the unlawful prorogation, on the surface it\u2019s not that odd to have a Queen\u2019s Speech. It is rather odd to have one right before a general election that the Tories have been campaigning for over the past month. They\u2019re getting the Queen to announce a Tory manifesto. pretentiouspenguin\n\n\u2018The hypocrisy is incredible\u2019\n\nThe Queen says the government is committed to the environment. There will be measures to improve air and water quality, and to promote the welfare of animals. The hypocrisy is incredible. This is the same govt thats being hauled through the courts by the people to ensure it abides by its own clean air act. mammonstool\n\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t it make you proud to see democracy in action?\u2019\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but today can be described as a rich great grandmother wearing costly jewels reading out in her plummy accent a list of various assorted right wing policies concocted by a \u201cgovernment\u201d that has yet to win a meaningful vote in parliament and one that has no majority. Doesn\u2019t it make you proud to see democracy in action? pipini\n\n\u2018The showiest most expensive party political broadcast\u2019\u2019\n\nThe showiest, most expensive party political broadcast ever. Paid for by taxpayers. On behalf of a party that is hopelessly divided. On behalf of a government that does not command a majority in parliament and has lost every one of six votes in a row. A Queen\u2019s speech that the government has no intention of implementing. Still, some of the flunkeys are wearing pretty frocks so it\u2019s all alright then.
