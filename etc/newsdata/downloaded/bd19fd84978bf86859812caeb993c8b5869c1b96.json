Lindsey Graham vowed to become Trump's 'worst nightmare' to protect the Kurds.\n\nGraham, who has been a Trump ally in fending off the Russia probe, blasted the president for abandoning Kurdish allies in Syria in an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, where evangelical leaders have been voicing concern about the risk to minorities including Christians in the region.\n\n'I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump's worst nightmare,' Graham vowed. 'I will not sit along the sidelines and watch a good ally, the Kurds, be slaughtered by Turkey.'\n\n'I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump's worst nightmare,' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday\n\nGraham cautioned: 'This is a defining moment for President Trump. He needs to up his game.'\n\nAnother forceful rebuke came in the vote tally for a House resolution to oppose 'the decision to end certain United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria.'\n\nAfter getting fast-tracked to the floor by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the resolution was backed by 354 lawmakers, with 60 voting against. The resolution said the Kurds fought 'courageously' against the 'brutality of ISIS.'\n\nThe resolution quotes from the surprise White House statement that announced the coming operation by Turkey and 'calls on the United States to continue supporting Syrian Kurdish communities through humanitarian support, including to those displaced or otherwise affected by ongoing violence in Syria.'\n\nIt also calls on the White House to 'present a clear and specific plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS,' amid fears captured fighters will get the chance to renew territorial gains that had been wiped out.\n\n'Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years,' said Trump. He urged Graham to 'focus' on his Judiciary Committee work, where his actions have insulated the president\n\nThis picture taken on October 15, 2019 shows smoke rising from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, from the Turkish side of the border at Ceylanpinar district in Sanliurfa, on the first week of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces\n\nUNDER CONTROL: President Donald Trump welcomed Russian intervention along with Syria to push back against Turkey's incursion into Syrian territory. Of the overall conflict, he said: 'It's a very semi-complicated \u2013 not too complicated if you're smart \u2013 but it's a semi-complicated problem, and I think it's a problem that we have nicely under control'\n\n'If Turkey goes into Syria it is between Turkey and Syria. It's not our problem,' Trump said Wednesday.

Graham chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, and has said he wants to probe the alleged FBI misconduct as Trump wants him to do.\n\n'Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers and fighting other people's wars,' Trump snapped. 'I want to get out of the Middle East. I think Lindsey should focus right now on Judiciary \u2013 like the Democrats, the do-nothing Democrats,' Trump admonished Graham.\n\n'And I think Lindsey should focus on Judiciary. He ought to find out about what happened with Comey, what happened with McCabe, Lisa, what happened with Peter Strzok, what happened with President Obama, what happened with Brennan,' Trump said, firing off names of national security and FBI officials from the Obama era who he blames for the Russia probe.\n\n'That\u2019s what Lindsey ought to focus on. That\u2019s what the people of South Carolina want him to focus on. The people of South Carolina don\u2019t want us to get into a war with Turkey \u2013 a NATO member \u2013 or with Syria. Let them fight their own wars. They\u2019ve been fighting for 1,000 years. Let them fight their own wars. The people of South Carolina want to see those troops come home. And I won an election based on that. And that\u2019s the way it is, whether it\u2019s good or bad. That\u2019s the way it is.'\n\nAt a White House press conference Wednesday, Trump welcomed further Russian military intervention in Syria, as Moscow teams with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and U.S. rival Iran to counter Turkey's attack on Kurds in Syrian territory \u2013 a conflagration about which Trump proclaimed 'Welcome to it.'\n\nThe president attacked U.S. allied Kurdish fighters as 'no angels,' and described them as a mercenary force, even as critics from both parties lamented a policy shift as leaving them victim to slaughter at the hands of the Turks.\n\n'Syria has a relationship with the Kurds \u2013 who by the way are not angels,' Trump told reporters alongside Italian President Sergio Mattarella. 'Who is an Angel? There aren't too many around. But Syria has a relationship with the Kurds. So they'll come in for their border. And they'll fight,' Trump said.\n\n'They may bring partners in, they could bring Russia in. And I say welcome to it,' Trump continued, after earlier in the day comparing the area to 'a lot of sand' that various sides can play with.\n\nAmid the pushback against his policy in Turkey and Syria, Trump indicated he would soon allow the release of a letter he penned to Turkish President Recep Erdogan shortly after he sent Turkish troops across the border into Syria.\n\nThe Oct. 9 letter encourages Erdogan to negotiate \u2013 but also taunts him not to be a 'tough guy' or the 'devil.'\n\n'History will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen,' Trump wrote.\n\n'Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!' he wrote, then added: 'I will call you later.'\n\nTrump told reporters he hadn't given Erdogan 'a green light' to invade, and claimed releasing 'a very powerful letter' would dispel misconceptions about the impact of his troop withdrawal from Syria days before he wrote it.\n\n'If anybody saw the letter, which can be released very easily if you\u2019d like \u2013 I could certainly release it,' he said.\n\n'But I wrote a letter right after that conversation \u2013 a very powerful letter. There was never given a green light.'\n\n'Let's work out a good deal!' he wrote. 'You don't want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don't want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy\u2014and I will.'\n\nTrump promised new concessions from Mazloum Kobani, commander of the Kurdish army known as the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\n'General Mazloum is willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past,' he wrote. 'I am confidently enclosing a copy of his letter to me, just received.'\n\nThe U.S. has funded and trained Mazloum's forces for at least five years.
