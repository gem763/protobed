Currey was greatly responsible for inflicting heavy losses in men and material on the enemy, for rescuing five comrades, two of whom were wounded, and for stemming an attack which threatened to flank his battalion\u2019s position.\u201d\n\nMr. Currey died on Tuesday at his home in Selkirk, N.Y., near Albany. He was 94. His death, which was confirmed by his son Michael, leaves two veterans who received the Medal of Honor in World War II still living.\n\nCharles Coolidge, 98, was cited for bravery in France while an Army technical sergeant. Hershel Williams, 96, was decorated for heroism in the battle for Iwo Jima while a Marine corporal.\n\nIn recalling his exploits of Dec. 21, 1944, long afterward, Mr. Currey once told The Times Union of Albany, \u201cIt was just one day of nine months of steady combat.\u201d\n\nBut it was an extraordinary day.\n\nThe firefight began about 4 a.m. with the American antitank units overrun. Private Currey and at least five other infantrymen, from their division\u2019s 20th Regiment, withdrew to an abandoned factory that had been used as an American military hospital before its doctors and patients were pulled out in the face of the German offensive.", "description": "Days after a massacre of G.I.s, he was a one-man onslaught in the face of German tanks, earning a Medal of Honor.
