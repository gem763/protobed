Mr. Martin said it was clear to him that \u201cTrump and the Republicans believe they can win and are doing everything to make it so.\u201d\n\nFew states in the Midwest exemplify Mr. Trump\u2019s strengths, such as popularity in rural areas, as well as his weaknesses, such as his shaky standing in suburban areas, the way Minnesota does. Which group turns out in bigger numbers could determine who wins the state on Election Day.\n\nIf Mr. Trump succeeds in flipping Minnesota\u2019s 10 electoral votes, it will probably mean that he has secured himself another four years in the White House. No Democratic candidate can carve a path to victory without Minnesota, and Trump officials are eager to put Democrats on defense there. One campaign official compared the dynamic to Republicans having to spend resources to defend a Republican stronghold like Indiana.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
