Until they have reached a decision, I must say we will pause this legislation,\" Johnson told the House of Commons.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he would recommend that European leaders accept the United Kindom's request for a Brexit extension.\n\nIt is not clear if the member states would meet at an emergency summit before October 31 to decide on an extension or whether they would agree on the matter by that is known as \"written procedure\".\n\nThere appears to be potential push-back from France on granting Britain a three-month extension or even a longer one.\n\nSpeaking before the Senate on Tuesday, French Deputy Minister for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin said Paris was ready to grant a \"technical\" extension for \"a few days\" so the UK parliament could complete the ratification process but would oppose a broader extension intended to \"rediscuss the agreement.\"\n\n\"We're being asked for an extension: for what purpose? What is the justification?,\" French minister for European affairs Amelie de Montchalin said, according to a transcript provided by her spokesman.\n\n\"We know that time alone won't provide the solution, but a political decision. We can't extend this situation indefinitely,\" she said.\n\nGermany said on Wednesday they would be open to granting Britain a short-term extension if it's for the right political reason.\n\nSpeaking to German media, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: \"We need to know: What will be the reason for this? If it will be about pushing back the date by two or three weeks to allow lawmakers in London to implement the ratification of the exit bill in a reasonable way, I think this will rather not be a problem.\"\n\nThe extension must be approved by all 27 members of the remaining member states.\n\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar welcomed the support for the deal in the Commons, saying: \"We will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension,\" Varadkar said.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson tweeted that the EU \"takes note\" of the result of the vote and expects the UK government to \"inform us about the next steps\".\n\nTusk is still \"consulting leaders on the UK's request for an extension until 31 January 2020,\" Mina Andreeva, the chief spokeswoman of the EU Commission tweeted.\n\nThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier did not respond to reporter questions after the vote, according to the BBC. But Barnier told the European Parliament earlier in the day that the transition period could go beyond December 2020.\"", "description": "EU leaders reacted to the UK's Brexit extension request after British MPs rejected Boris Johnson's accelerated timeline.", "authors": ["Lauren Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/16/56/1000x563_cmsv2_2ffcbb18-d8a7-53aa-8702-6ff113c29ea0-4251656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
