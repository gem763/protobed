Another of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, met privately with the president in Florida in March 2018, a month before the F.B.I. searched his home, hotel room and office. Mr. Trump publicly embraced Mr. Cohen, until it became clear he might speak against the president.\n\nA White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAsked over text message about the significance of the lunch, Mr. Giuliani directed a reporter to Mr. Trump\u2019s show of support on Twitter.\n\nHe said his relationship with Mr. Trump was \u201cthe same as ever,\u201d but declined to answer additional questions, explaining he was watching the New York Yankees\u2019 playoff baseball game against the Houston Astros.", "description": "The president\u2019s multiple shows of support for his personal lawyer on Saturday seemed meant to tamp down questions about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s standing.", "authors": ["Kenneth P.
