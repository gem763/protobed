Storm surges are expected to subside, the official said.\n\nThe National Hurricane Centre reports Hurricane Dorian is now moving parallel to the coast of Florida, and is moving northwest at 6mph (9km/h).\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hurricane Dorian rips into Bahamas, killing at least five\n\nFlorida, Georgia and North and South Carolina will still feel the impact of the storm and have all declared states of emergency, with mandatory evacuation orders across many areas.\n\nWalt Disney World, Legoland and other tourist parks have announced early closures in anticipation of the hurricane.\n\nIs climate change making hurricanes worse?\n\nScientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, said BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump\n\nSea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms\n\nUse our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured:", "description": "Prime Minister Hubert Minnis says the country can \"expect more deaths\" after the devastating storm.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10E8C/production/_108606296_tv056237873.jpg"}
