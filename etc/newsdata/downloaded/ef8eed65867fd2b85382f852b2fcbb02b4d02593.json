(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe body is wearing shorts, its legs now bent at impossible angles, its face frozen in a bloated grimace, under what\u2019s left of a collapsed cement roof. A man who knew him says his name was Sebely, and he was seeking shelter anywhere he could find it, just as hundreds of other poor residents in this town did when Hurricane Dorian struck.\n\n\u201cSix days! Six days and that body\u2019s still here!\u201d shouted Charite Alouivor, 55, a carpenter of Haitian descent. \u201cWhere are they? Where is the help? Where is the water? Where is the food? Where is the government? Why are there bodies still here?\u201d\n\nThis port city of more than 6,000 was once home to quaint island businesses, wood-frame homes and one of the largest urban slums in the Bahamas. When Dorian struck, Marsh Harbour was ground zero, the point of impact of one of the strongest cyclones on record. The storm made landfall here as a Category 5 hurricane, a deadly tempest that leveled homes, crushed cars, crumpled boats and killed people.\n\nOn Thursday, teams in hazmat suits were scouring Marsh Harbour, performing the grim, grueling duty of digging through the rubble for remains.\n\n\u201cThere are more bodies over there in the Mudd,\u201d said 12-year-old Ville Maurin. He pointed \u2014 through trees stripped bare and crushed \u2014 to the slum, which had been reduced to a field of dense debris.\n\nHe said he rode out the storm inside a refrigerator in his home.\n\n\u201cWhen I opened the door,\u201d he said. \u201cOh Lord, oh Lord. Everything gone.\u201d\n\n[First, 40 hours of terror. Then people ventured out, and saw their Bahamas in ruins]\n\nBahamian authorities continued Thursday to assess the destruction wrought by the most powerful storm to strike in decades. Officials raised the number of confirmed deaths to 30 but expect the toll will keep climbing.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, the British Royal Navy, relief organizations and volunteers continued to deliver emergency supplies and evacuate victims. But in a storm-ravaged nation of 400,000 spread across more than 700 islands, conditions and communications are challenging.\n\n\n\nA neighborhood in Marsh Harbour is reduced to rubble.

Eric Jones, commander of the Coast Guard\u2019s 7th District in Miami. Storm surge and debris in many areas have prevented helicopters from landing, boats from navigating and trucks from driving.\n\n\u201cPhysically, there\u2019s just roads that aren\u2019t there anymore,\u201d Jones said.\n\nMarsh Harbour, the largest town on the northern island of Great Abaco, has laid bare the inequality in natural disaster.\n\nSome wealthy islanders have paid private aviation firms upward of $20,000 to be airlifted out. But the people of the Mudd are stuck here. Some are squatting in broken, abandoned homes. Others are scrambling for floor space in shelters without steady food or water.\n\n\n\nDebris from Hurricane Dorian covers a neighborhood Thursday in Marsh Harbour. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nAt night, residents say, the sound of gunfire has echoed through the wreckage. For days, there has been virtually no law in the streets. The only armed guards visible on a busy Thursday were the security personnel at a local hospital.\n\n\u201cThe rich people, yeah, they can get out,\u201d said Charlese McIntosh, a 33-year-old waitress whose house was totaled in the storm. \u201cThey take their friends, their family, in helicopters and small planes.\u201d\n\nShe had salvaged a few items of clothing, and hung them on bushes outside the Marsh Harbour Healthcare Center. Hundreds of residents had sheltered there for days. On Thursday morning, they were cleared out.\n\nMcIntosh said she came to the hospital because she had heard a rumor that people would be evacuated from there to Nassau. By late Thursday, there was no sign of rescue.\n\n\u201cWe need to go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to get out of here. We have families, too.\u201d\n\n[\u2018There\u2019s nothing left\u2019: In the Bahamas, Hurricane Dorian reduces paradise to a miserable heap]\n\nSitha Silien, 25, sat outside with her 2-year-old son, Jaden. She said her mother was washed away by rushing water, and her brother died trying to save her.\n\nShe held up a passport.\n\n\u201cThis is my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is dead in the water.\u201d\n\nThe body remains near what\u2019s left of her house.\n\n\u201cWhere should I go?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nFrom the air, the Mudd is an expanse of broken rubble. The crushed huts are no longer recognizable among the splintered timber and twisted tin roofs. An enclave of poor immigrants mostly from Haiti, the Mudd was forgotten even before the storm, residents say. The better conditions that officials promised for more than a decade never materialized.\n\n\u201cNow they treat us like they did before,\u201d said Alexandre Licantel, a 42-year-old housepainter who lived 18 years in the Mudd. \u201cLike we don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nLicantel\u2019s two-room shack was smashed to pieces.\n\n\n\nFrom left, Marsh Harbor residents Allan George, Villefranc Michel and Tares Diefuerne on Thursday. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIslanders drove half-destroyed cars, some with their front windows blown out, gingerly around fallen power lines and debris. Some dragged rollaway suitcases toward the hospital in search of shelter and food.\n\nEmmanuel Nelson, a 46-year-old tradesman, sat on the stoop of a house blown off its foundation. He and five other men are squatting there now.\n\n\u201cWe have no aid. No one is helping us,\u201d he said. He said they have gone house to abandoned house in search of food.\n\n\u201cThis is survival,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to help ourselves.\u201d\n\nSome homeless islanders have sought shelter in a municipal building. Several said they were told Thursday to leave and find shelter elsewhere. Their accounts could not be immediately confirmed.\n\n\u201cWhere am I sleeping tonight, huh?\u201d said Javie Bienaimer, a 48-year-old repairman. \u201cWhat am I supposed to eat? What are any of us supposed to eat? Come on, man. it\u2019s been six days.\u201d\n\nAlouivor, the carpenter, said he hadn\u2019t been able to bathe, brush his teeth or change his clothes in six days.\n\nHaitian immigrants squatting in houses near the health center said they were doing what they could to survive.\n\n\u201cPlease take me with you,\u201d Licantel said. \u201cThey have forgotten us. If I stay here, I am going to die.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer Marsh Harbour fire chief Norwel Gordon surveys the damage Thursday.
