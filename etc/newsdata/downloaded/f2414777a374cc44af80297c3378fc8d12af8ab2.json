Handmade from 100 per cent cotton and super soft to the touch, it awarded our bathroom a rustic, Scandi look that brought instant calm \u2013 ideal for our home spa wants. Naturally high quality from The White Company, we found it kept its shape after a gentle machine wash and an easy reshape.\n\nBuy now\n\nEsprit cool stripes pink bath mat: From \u00a339, Modern Rugs\n\nThe international fashion brand known for its cool, preppy aesthetic offers a sideline in home accessories that\u2019s just as fresh. We loved the cheery colourway of this contemporary bath mat: rainbow brights on bubblegum pink. Its embossed stripy texture was a treat for our feet, stepping out of the bath onto quality carpet. The Modern Rugs site allows you to add a premium anti-slip underlay for extra reassurance.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Little House Shop textured bath mat: \u00a326.40, Not On The Highstreet\n\nWith its hammam-inspired tassels and loose geometric diamond pattern, this bath mat is a relaxed boho choice. We loved this design in our shower room: a mini version of our plush bedroom rug, in fact. But this one comes with a non-slip backing, keeping it reassuringly secure on our shiny tiles, despite its fluffy surface. And it kept its fluffiness after a 30 degree wash.\n\nBuy now\n\nTajo bath mat in \u2018green grey\u2019: \u00a345, Urbanara\n\nFrom the brand that delivers beautiful handcrafted textiles, ethically produced with natural materials, comes this intricately detailed bath mat in a pleasingly bumpy herringbone design. The mat, made from 100 per cent cotton in heavy looped weave, is available in three sizes to suit your bathroom space. We loved its quality craft-driven aesthetic in ours.\n\nBuy now\n\nPink chenille bath mat: \u00a36, George\n\nOffering both outstanding value for money, and a daring dash of Barbie pink in the bathroom, this is one of George at Asda\u2019s bestsellers \u2013 and it\u2019s little wonder why. Made from super absorbent microfibres, it\u2019s the chunky chenille texture that makes it so pleasing to step onto with wet feet. It\u2019s also quick-drying, fade-resistant, machine washable and will happily withstand a tumble dry without losing its shape.\n\nBuy now\n\nJules bath mat: \u00a338, Anthropologie\n\nAnother luxury bath mat that playfully mimics a conventional rug, this one is a traditional Persian carpet in miniature. Its colourful geometric motifs brought living room luxury into our bathing space, and we loved its quirky and incongruous presence. But make no mistake, this polyester rug is designed for the humid conditions of a bathroom and once properly unrolled, it stayed put despite the steam.\n\nBuy now\n\nDouble sided tufted bath rug: From \u00a325, Tielle Love Luxury\n\nWhen it comes to turning a bathroom into a spa-like sanctuary, for some, only snow white textiles will do. Enter Tielle Love Luxury, its fluffy offerings can be found in some of the world\u2019s most luxurious hotels \u2013 a true marker of quality in its pleasingly accessible wares. We tested the larger of the bath mats, which offered big impact for its size alone. Double sided, choose from feathery soft, or gratifyingly textured. Your feet will thank you for it.\n\nBuy now\n\nSofia bath mat: \u00a3158, Missoni\n\nWe couldn\u2019t wait to sink our toes into the deep pile of this luxurious rug. Daring in both colour and shape, it is the ultimate bath mat for the fashion set (alas, with a price tag to match). But it has real wow factor, as literally everyone who used our bathroom contended. Made from tufted cotton, its thickness makes it a standout piece, along with its striking purple petals that overshoot the edge. Move over Missoni stripes, we\u2019re all for the bold botanicals.\n\nBuy now\n\nKleine Wolke bamboo wood bath mat: From \u00a319.95, Victorian Plumbing\n\nGerman brand Kleine Wolke bring the outside in with this roll up bamboo bath mat. The sustainable material adds natural warmth to the bathroom and its soft, slatted surface is a pleasure to step onto \u2013 not unlike the feeling underfoot in a sauna.

Instant tranquillity.\n\nBuy now\n\nChristy supreme hygro bath mat in \u2018kingfisher\u2019, set of two: \u00a325, The Hut\n\nHomewares in rich jewel hues is a trend that keeps on giving, especially when offset with gleaming metallics. We love pairing this shade with gold-coloured faucets and fittings. Sold in a set of two, Christy\u2019s subtly textured bath mats are crafted from 100 per cent cotton and just like their matching towels, boast a high thread count, making them super soft. We loved the addition of this handsome pair: one for the bath, one for the shower cubicle.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Bath mats\n\nThe White Company\u2019s Toulouse bath mat is a standout piece for its chunky hand-knitted texture.
