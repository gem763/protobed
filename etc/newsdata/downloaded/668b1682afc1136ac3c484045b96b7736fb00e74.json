There's no rappelling into caves to uncover buried scrolls, no prowling the ocean floor in spherical subs, no tuning of immense, underground magnets in the hunt for ghostly subatomic particles.\n\nStill, psychologists do occasionally excavate the habits of lost civilisations. In a paper published in the latest issue of Current Directions in Psychological Science, a team of researchers reviewed studies of a once-widespread personal trait, one \"characterised by an ability to accurately acknowledge one's limitations and abilities, and an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented rather than self-focused\". Humility.\n\nIn an era that future historians might not immediately label 'The Age of the Mensch', the study of humility amounts to a bold contrary bet.\n\n\"Research on humility has been growing, and fast,\" says Daryl Van Tongeren, a psychologist at Hope College in Michigan and lead author of the new paper. \"It was time to bring people up to date and lay out the open questions to guide further research.\"\n\nIn an era that future historians might not immediately label \"The Age of the Mensch\", the study of humility amounts to a bold contrary bet. The word \"humble\" travels so often now as a verb that embodying its gentler spirit, the adjective, can be an invitation to online trolling, professional invisibility or worse. Oscar Wilde wrote that, before he found humility, he spent two years behind bars experiencing \"anguish that wept aloud\" and \"misery that could find no voice\" \u2013 which sounds more like defeat than victory.\n\nHumility is a relative newcomer to social and personality psychology, at least as a trait or behaviour to be studied on its own. It arrived as part of the effort, beginning in the 1990s, to build a \"positive\" psychology: a more complete understanding of sustaining qualities such as pride, forgiveness, grit and contentment.\n\nMore recently, humility has found a foothold in the most widely used measure of personality traits, the five-factor questionnaire. The wallflower is attracting some attention, and so far appears to be absorbing it well.\n\nIn one series of experiments, Elizabeth Krumrei Mancuso of California's Pepperdine University scored volunteers on a measure of what she called intellectual humility \u2014 an awareness of how incomplete and fallible their views on political and social issues were. This kind of humility was not related to IQ measures or political affiliation, she found; it was strongly linked to curiosity, reflection and open-mindedness.\n\nMahatma Gandhi is the epitome of humility.\n\nIn another study, which is developing, Krumrei Mancuso had 587 adults complete questionnaires intended to measure levels of intellectual humility. The participants rated how much they agreed with various statements, including \"I feel small when others disagree with me on topics that are close to my heart\" and \"For the most part, others have more to learn from me than I have to learn from them.\"", "description": "Humility might seem like a personality trait belonging to a long-gone civilisation \u2013 but psychologists says its time it made a comeback.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.349%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1133%2C$y_914/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/927f6ebe056db966e293259b226060845867cda6", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
