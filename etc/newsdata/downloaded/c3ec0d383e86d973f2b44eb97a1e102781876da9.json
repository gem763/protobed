In one corner is Disney, the undisputed king of visual entertainment. In the other; Apple with its legion of inbuilt customers and technical knowhow.\n\nBut which service will come out on top? Let's compare them and find out.\n\nDuring the iPhone 11 event, Apple finally announced it was entering the streaming market with Apple TV+. With both Disney and Apple+ heading to Australia later this year, we decided to compare them both to see which one deserves your money more. Here's how they stack up.\n\nApple TV Plus: Australian Release Date, Pricing And TV Shows Today's big Apple event was primarily focused on the iPhone 11 - but we also learned more about the company's Netflix competitor; Apple TV+. The new streaming entertainment service is chock-full of original content and will launch at a super low $7.99 per month. (There's also a way to get free access for a whole year!) Here are the details. Read more\n\nContent\n\nWhat's available on a service is usually the biggest selling point, with many Australians signing up to Foxtel specifically for Game of Thrones or Netflix specifically for Stranger Things, for example.\n\nIn terms of quantity, Disney+ has it in the bag. With its entire back catalogue of movies and shows, acquired studios like Marvel Studios, plus original programming for popular franchises like Star Wars, Disney has a natural advantage here. Apple is traditionally a tech-based company that remains largely untested as a fictional content producer.\n\nApple TV+ is trying to make its selling point quality over quantity. That's a tough one considering Disney is usually pretty good at both. Some of Apple TV+'s upcoming releases, like The Morning Wars, feature the likes of Jennifer Anniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell, while another show, See, has Jason Momoa as the lead.\n\nIt's clear Apple is really aiming for big names to try and wow people into flocking to its service. We'll see how well that works out. In the meantime, compare the lineups for yourself.\n\nDisney Plus: Australian Pricing, Release Date And Content Disney has revealed the Australian launch date for its new streaming service, Disney+ - and it's coming much sooner than we all predicted. It will be available this November and it's bound to shake up Australia's streaming scene in a big way with Disney likely scrounging for all its content from the various streaming services, like Stan, Foxtel and Netflix, already hosting its content. Here's everything you need to know, including how much it will cost Aussie subscribers.

With that subscription, up to three other people will be able to use the login to watch content making it pretty damn cost-effective.\n\nAn Apple TV+ subscription can be shared with others through a Family Sharing group, meaning up to five other 'family' members can use the same login. As it's also offering a single tier, titles are expected to be streamed in HD.\n\nPrice and release date\n\nDisney+ will be available for Australians from 19 November for $8.99 a month or a discounted yearly sum of $89.99. Apple TV+ will come a little earlier on 1 November and will cost Australians $7.99 per month with a free seven-day trial. Apple is offering 12 months for free for anyone who purchases an Apple product from 11 September.\n\nThe interesting difference with both offerings is the lack of tiered offerings, which we're used to with Netflix, Foxtel and Stan subscriptions. Other than that, the pricing packages don't differ too wildly.\n\nVerdict\n\nWhile Apple TV+'s shows might be good quality, there will only be nine of them at launch. For a dollar extra, you can instead have Disney+, which will give you access to more than 300 shows and movies and while not all of them will be new releases, a fair chunk, including the upcoming Star Wars series The Mandalorian, are shaping up to be must-watch series.\n\nIf you're already looking to purchase a new Apple device, the free subscription is a nice little deal but to pay for it separately? Apple's going to need to do a bit more convincing to get us to add another subscription to our tally.", "description": "Two of the world's largest companies are about to go head-to-head with competing streaming platforms.
