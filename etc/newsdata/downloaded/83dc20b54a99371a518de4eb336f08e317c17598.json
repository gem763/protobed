Kennedy was 'off limits'.\n\n'How could you talk about it? Not only was JFK's assassination an iconic moment in history, it affected her in a dominating way. She was history. It was definitely-off limits,' Simon said in an excerpt obtained by People magazine.\n\nCarly Simon has opened up on her years-long friendship with Jackie Kennedy Onassis in her new memoir. They are pictured together on Martha's Vineyard in 1989\n\nSimon recalled one incident in 1992 when she went to the cinema with Onassis around the time Oliver Stone's JFK film was playing.\n\nShe said she purposely chose a cinema that wasn't playing the film but still accidentally asked Onassis if she had seen it.\n\n'How on earth could I have said that? It was almost as if I was trying to be cruel - as if I'd let her to the theater to say it. Jackie was horrified. She said: 'No, no, no Carly!'\n\n'Then during the movie she hunched down in her seat and flinched whenever there was a gunshot.'\n\nSimon said she wrote Onassis a lengthy apology and her friend insisted she understood how it could have happened.\n\nSimon said Onassis then mentioned how she was overly affected by sights and sounds.\n\nOnassis did, however, speak about her late husband as their friendship grew.\n\nSimon, who first met Onassis in 1983 on Martha's Vineyard, revealed that anyone who was friends with the former first lady knew that talking about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy was 'off limits'\n\nSimon said her friend definitely knew about JFK's affairs but she understood her husband had made 'stupid mistakes'.\n\nThe You're So Vain singer detailed her years-long friendship with Onassis as part of her soon-to-be-released memoir - Touched by the sun: Mr friendship with Jackie\n\nOnassis brushed them off because 'she knew he loved her more, much more', Simon said.\n\nSpeaking about marrying Aristotle Onassis in 1968, Simon said: 'She said he was very sexy - he would sing to her on his yacht and take her great places to make love.\n\n'She knew marrying him was the bad-girl move. In a way I never knew whether she was sticking up for her own decision or whether she really loved him'.\n\nShe also spoke regularly of her children, according to Simon.\n\nOnassis was 'very consumed' with getting her son John Jr on the right path and was 'horrified' when he briefly dated Madonna.\n\nSimon said she became friends with Onassis after being introduced by JFK Jr. in 1983.\n\nOnassis, who worked in publishing later in life, went on to become Simon's book editor.\n\nSimon said she became friends with Onassis after being introduced by JFK Jr. in 1983.\n\nThey remained closed friends until Onassis' death in 1994.\n\nIt is no secret that Simon and Onassis were friends but the singer has never spoken about their relationship in great detail.\n\n'She was a friend unlike any other. I miss her every day,' Simon said.\n\nShe said it took her a long time to decide to write about her friend.\n\n'Why am I writing about someone so private who disliked attention? If someone affects your life as Jackie did mine, you can't not write about her.'\n\nSimon did, however, say that she had withheld a 'great deal'.\n\nSimon's book 'Touched by the Sun - My friendship with Jackie' is due out on October 22.", "description": "The You're So Vain singer detailed her years-long friendship with\u00a0Onassis as part of her soon-to-be-released memoir - Touched by the sun: Mr friendship with Jackie.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/21/19502242-0-image-a-2_1570651439145.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
