He was reportedly paid $50,000 a month to work in an industry in which he had no previous experience. The company's founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, was the country's former ecology minister and had been under investigation for allegedly embezzling millions in public funds.\n\nAnti-corruption groups in Ukraine note it is common for foreigners to sit on company boards there, to offer an air of legitimacy.\n\nIn 2016, in his role as vice-president, Joe Biden led the charge to oust Ukraine's prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, for not doing enough to root out corruption. Shokin's firing is the event Trump has seized on, arguing that it shows Biden pressured a foreign country into firing its top prosecutor and drop an investigation into corrupt business practices at a company involving Biden's son.\n\n..Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren\u2019t pressured at all during the \u201cnice\u201d call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u2019s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That\u2019s the real story! \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nThe reality, however, is much different. Biden was part of an international effort to pressure Ukraine to deal with corruption, and Burisma was not under investigation at the time Shokin was fired.\n\n\"Basically, civil society all were calling to dismiss Shokin \u2026 because of his ineffectiveness and sabotage in the investigation and prosecution of the oligarchs, including Zlochevsky and Burisma,\" said Anastasiya Kozlovtseva of Transparency International Ukraine, a not-for-profit anti-corruption watchdog in Kiev.\n\nIn Ukraine, Shokin's dismissal \"was not connected to the name of Biden at all,\" Kozlovtseva said, noting the European Union and International Monetary Fund were among those clamouring for change.\n\nUkraine's prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, is seen speaking during a news conference in Kiev in 2016. (Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters)\n\nPushing out an ineffective prosecutor would have brought more attention to Burisma, not less, she points out, contrary to Trump's accusations.\n\nThose facts didn't stop Trump's campaign from pursuing Ukraine as a line of attack. In May, a story appeared in the New York Times that laid out Trump's case, only making passing mention of Trump's own efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nAt that time, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden in 2016. That was repeated on Friday by Lutsenko's successor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka. He did announce a review of high-profile cases involving associates of former president Viktor Yanukovych, cases which include some related to Burisma.\n\nCampaign consequences\n\nWhile Trump's corruption allegations against Biden aren't supported by evidence, the lingering cloud of controversy kicked up by the president could have consequences, both good and bad, for Biden's presidential ambitions.\n\nDemocratic strategist Jim Manley doesn't see the attacks having a long-term impact on Democratic primary voters. He dismisses Trump's broadsides as \"cheap smash-mouth politics.\"\n\nJoe Biden, right, and his son, Hunter Biden, attend an NCAA basketball game between Georgetown University and Duke University in 2010.

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\n\"I don't think this is resonating very much with Democrats; it's just serving as more red meat to the Republican base,\" he said.\n\nBut Democratic political consultant Mike Mikus says even though the accusation doesn't stand up to scrutiny, it can still give voters considering Biden pause.\n\nHe draws a parallel between Biden's situation and the concern around Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state that cast a cloud over her campaign for president in 2016 and remains a key Republican talking point to this day.\n\nIf it doesn't plant a seed of doubt in voters' minds, it is at the very least a distraction, Mikus says, noting the issue is dominating reporters' questions on the campaign trail.\n\n\"They're not asking him about his health-care plan. They're not asking him about his jobs plan. They're asking him about this \u2014 and that's a problem.\"\n\nThough the Ukraine affair could be a weak spot for Biden, don't expect his Democratic opponents to exploit it, says Ian Russell, former national political director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\n\"Democrat on Democrat violence is not something that Democratic primary voters are into right now,\" he said.\n\nHe points out that attacks on Biden from Kamala Harris and Julian Castro during debates ultimately didn't prove successful.\n\nThe top contenders trying to chase down Biden in the Democratic race are Bernie Sanders, left, and Elizabeth Warren, right. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nThat means Biden's opponents are likely to steer clear of Hunter Biden's past, including his work in China, which Trump has also seized on as a line of attack.\n\n\"In a lot of ways, it disarms his opponents in the primary,\" said Mikus, the Pittsburgh-based strategist. \"Now, there's a built-in defence where, if they bring it up, it can easily be deflected as, 'They're just repeating a debunked attack by Donald Trump.\"\n\nHow does Biden respond?\n\nThe strategists say how this all plays out politically for Biden will be determined largely by how he responds. Biden has long sought to make his campaign a one-on-one fight with Trump, at the expense of his Democratic primary opponents.\n\n\"Now let me make something clear to Mr. Trump and his hatchetmen and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I'm not going anywhere,\" Biden said at a campaign stop in Reno, Nev., this week.\n\n\"You are not going to destroy me and you're not going to destroy my family.\"\n\nDemocratic competitor Elizabeth Warren has chipped away at Biden's lead in the polls, and her and Bernie Sanders surpassed Biden in the latest fundraising figures.\n\nRussell says those developments aren't the result of the Ukraine story, but rather the influence of progressive voters who are less concerned about electability and more concerned about which candidate can deliver the kind of long-term structural change they want to address issues like health care and income inequality.\n\nFor voters whose primary concern is determining which candidate is best suited to beat Trump, the president's focus on Biden could help. Reminding them, Mikus says, that the attacks mean Trump sees Biden as his biggest threat.\n\n\"They can remind voters that Donald Trump is more or less committing crimes to destroy Joe Biden because he's so afraid of facing Joe Biden in a general election,\" Mikus said, noting Biden polls well against Trump in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nIn a list of national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics, Biden beats Trump in a head-to-head matchup in all but one.\n\nMikus suggests Biden should go hard at Trump.\n\n\"When there's a bully, sometimes you have to hit them in the nose.\"\n\nManley says there's a delicate balance between giving the attacks more oxygen and fighting back.\n\nMany operatives from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign felt they didn't respond strongly enough to Trump's attacks in 2016, he says.\n\n\"I don't envy [Biden], but if you learn one thing from the Clinton campaign, it's that you can't let things go unanswered.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump answers questions from reporters. Trump's focus on his rival Biden has him facing an impeachment inquiry. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nHow this ultimately plays out with voters may not reveal itself for a while yet. Mikus says these types of political battles usually take a few weeks to register in the polls.\n\n\"The swing voters, who are a little less dialed-in to the day-to-day battles, it's going to take a while for this to sink in and I think it's still up for grabs as to how they respond.\n\nManley says Biden still has a lot of work ahead.\n\n\"He still has to show Democrats that he's best positioned to take on Trump \u2014 he hasn't sealed the deal yet.\"", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on Joe Biden, while largely untrue, could hurt the former vice-president's run for the Democratic presidential nomination.
