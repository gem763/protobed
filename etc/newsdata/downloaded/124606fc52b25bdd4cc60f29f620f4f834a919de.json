Marco was killed,' Miradossa says in the La Lene programme, via mediaset. 'Maybe those who killed him didn't want to do it, but he was killed. I do not know why at that time judges and police did not go to the bottom.\n\n'They said that Marco was in the throes of delirium for narcotics, but I am convinced that... Marco was killed.'\n\nPantani's mother, Tonina, has previously said that she thinks her son was killed.\n\nShe called for the investigation into his death to resume earlier this year, on the anniversary of his death.\n\nThe Italian cyclist Pantani won the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia in 1998\n\nPantani pictured being crowned as the Tour de France winner in August 1998\n\nThe cyclist pictured riding in one of his last races in May 2003 before his death\n\n'There was someone else in the room. He was forced to swallow cocaine. From who? Why,'' she said to La Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\n'The investigation should be reopened. I feel they killed him.'\n\nPantani also won the Giro d'Italia in 1998 but in 1999, was disqualified from the event after giving a haematocrit reading (the level of red blood cells to the volume of blood) of 52, two points over the UCI's (cycling's governing body) maximum level of 50.\n\nHe has also been connected with investigations into EPO use in the years after his death.\n\nA French senate report in 2013 said that Pantani's samples from his 1998 Tour de France victory were retested in 2004 and came back positive.\n\n'My son was never found doped, but now I understand how it worked,' Pantani's mother said. 'If he hadn't done it, he would have been the village fool.'\n\nFriends hold up the yellow jersey Pantani won at his funeral in February 2004", "description": "A documentary due to be broadcast in Italy on Tuesday night will throw into question the manner of the death of popular cyclist Marco Pantani.", "authors": ["Jack Bezants For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/14/19444472-0-image-a-29_1570541924851.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
