We know we\u2019ve got a long way to go, we know we\u2019re nowhere near the finished article, we know that in the next two years we have to really find the challenge from within, the motivation.\u201d\n\nThe manager agreed with the assessment that England have largely failed to show they can put in a complete performance over 90 minutes, and when asked at what point the building process ends, he said: \u201cMaybe Euro 2021, maybe the Olympics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building for the biggest stages, Wembley [against Germany] is a big stage next month and we want to perform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s things we know internally that we\u2019re going to have to grin and bear when we get performances [that] don\u2019t quite click over 90 minutes, but we\u2019ve laid out the plans for the players, we\u2019ve discussed it with them and they know where we are going on this journey.\u201d\n\nWith the sun setting behind the Arr\u00e1bida hills that overlook Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s city of birth, Portugal were not to be beaten easily. Switching to a 4-1-4-1 formation, Francisco Neto\u2019s team stayed compact and frustrated the visiting side. It was extremely effective. Neville\u2019s makeshift midfield of Lucy Bronze, Lucy Staniforth and Keira Walsh, dominated possession but struggled find space between the lines leaving Beth England woefully isolated on her first start.\n\nThe Lionesses looked a little lost on the patchy turf of the Est\u00e1dio do Bonfim and with Portugal targeting Alex Greenwood, through Carolina Mendes and Ana Borges, the left-back became frustrated with a lack of assistance from Mead in front of her. With 10 minutes played the home team looked to catch England on their first real break, Lyon\u2019s J\u00e9ssica Silva (the cousin of Bernardo Silva) wriggling free of Greenwood on the right and feeding Mendes, who forced a clearance from Steph Houghton.\n\nBronze struggled with her positioning when England were out of possession but had the drive and knowhow on the ball to offer a threat. Shortly after Portugal\u2019s first effort the European player of the year played a piercing low through-ball to England but Morais read the move and got there a fraction ahead of the striker.\n\nMead had problems shaking Matilde Fidalgo from her tail until Bronze dummied a pass from Staniforth that allowed the Manchester City player to escape her marker. Mead raced into the box and fired across goal but the stretching England could not quite get there.\n\nAgainst Brazil on Saturday England had gone in at the break without a goal to show for a strong performance and on the stroke of half-time here they again spurned a chance to take the lead. England found room on the left and popped a shot towards the back post \u2013 but M\u00f3nica Mendes arrived to clear just ahead of Parris.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nNeville shuffled the pack, pushing Bronze back into her more natural right-back berth by bringing on Jordan Nobbs for Rachel Daly and swapping England for Jodie Taylor.\n\n\u201cJordan knitted the midfield together,\u201d said Neville. \u201cBeth Mead started to get some joy on that right hand side, Nikita did. [Portugal] tired, which meant the spaces got wider.\u201d\n\nMead finally poked home the scrappy breakthrough goal on 72 minutes. It was a gift from the goalkeeper Morais, who dropped a looping cross at the near post, leaving Mead to tap in from close range.\n\nIt is a win, and Neville will not care how it came. \u201cUltimately you have to win football games. I\u2019m not stupid, you have to win games,\u201d he had said before this crucial tie. He may have been without a host of key players but this is a squad that should be able to cope and with Germany up next month, in front of a crowd of 77,000 at Wembley, they have a much bigger test ahead of them.", "description": "Patr\u00edcia Morais\u2019s horrible goalkeeping error handed England the only goal of the game in their 1-0 win over Portugal", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0018705aa9b6cebfbab1b8ed01dde23474b8b3d0/0_164_4306_2583/master/4306.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a204dd24e7ea9ddceba379cf3feb295f", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
