Opening more psychiatric institutions and providing other mental health services have become the president\u2019s go-to solutions for mass shootings, as Democrats have called for gun control. (Michael Conroy/AP)\n\nWisconsin state Rep. Paul Tittl always thought mental illness was something that afflicted other families. But one year, the Republican lawmaker got what he called a triple \u201csmack dab, slap in the face.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the maid of honor in Tittl\u2019s wedding committed suicide. Then his cousin committed suicide. Another relative was institutionalized with a serious mental illness that year.\n\nNow Tittl has joined the ranks of Republican lawmakers nationwide pushing to expand mental health treatment, a remarkable turnaround for a party that a few years ago was staking its reputation on cutting taxes and starving government budgets. The renewed GOP focus comes as the party, which lost more than 300 state legislative seats last year, has struggled to convince voters it cares about a host of societal challenges, including mass shootings, opioid and methamphetamine abuse, homelessness and surging suicide rates.\n\n\u201cWe used to just brush it under the rug,\u201d said Tittl, chairman of the state Assembly\u2019s Committee on Mental Health, \u201cbut the simple fact is we now know we need to talk about it.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, Republican state legislators nationwide have proposed 5,372 bills that mention \u201cmental health,\u201d about twice as many as they sponsored five years ago, according to a Washington Post analysis using Quorum, a database of state and federal legislation. Republican governors in several states have made mental health reform a key component of their legislative agendas.\n\nDemocratic legislators still sponsor more mental health legislation than their GOP colleagues \u2014 about 10,000 bills so far this year. But the number of bills sponsored by Republicans has increased for three consecutive years, according to Quorum.\n\nIn Minnesota, GOP state senators have proposed an additional $25 million for mental health services for students, farmers, expectant mothers and homeless people. In Georgia, the GOP legislature formed a committee this past spring to take a comprehensive look at all aspects of that state\u2019s mental health system. And in Utah, Republican legislators and Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R) have been adding mental health counselors to schools.\n\n[Mental health problems rise significantly among young Americans]\n\nEven in Washington, President Trump has vowed to consider federal policy changes, including floating a controversial proposal to open more psychiatric institutions. It has become his go-to solution for mass shootings, most recently after August\u2019s back-to-back shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio.\n\n\u201cI do want people to remember the words \u2018mental illness.\u2019 These people are mentally ill,\u201d Trump said of mass shooters several days after the incidents. \u201cA lot of our conversation has to do with the fact that we have to open up institutions; we can\u2019t let these people be on the streets.\u201d\n\nMany Democratic lawmakers and advocates say Republican leaders\u2019 growing focus on mental health is at odds with their track record of limiting funding and opposing Medicaid expansion, which generally covers mental health services. They say it\u2019s a political play to latch on to growing public awareness of the issue.\n\n\u201cI call it a facade, because the commitment is somewhat phony,\u201d said Iowa state Sen. Rob Hogg (D), who this summer voted against Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds\u2019s proposed expansion of mental health services, because he said he worried it wouldn\u2019t be adequately funded. \u201cAnd I know they are just responding, as Republicans usually do, because they know the public wants something done, so they just create an appearance of doing something.\u201d\n\nAbout 1 in 5 adults suffers from a mental illness each year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. There has been a 31 percent increase in suicides during the past two decades, with rates for farmers, veterans and teenagers rising especially quickly.\n\nMass shootings also have brought the issue to the forefront.\n\nAfter last year\u2019s shooting at a high school in Santa Fe, Tex., Gov. Greg Abbott (R) made mental health reform a key component of his legislative agenda. In June, Abbott signed legislation that increases mental health training for teachers while also expanding students\u2019 access to school-based counseling. Later in the summer, after the shooting at a Walmart in El Paso that killed 22 people, Abbott again signaled he would focus on mental health \u2014 not guns \u2014 to try to calm public angst about gun violence.\n\n\u201cBottom line is mental health is a large contributor to any type of violence or shooting violence, and the state of Texas this past session passed a lot of legislation and provided funding for the state to better address that challenge,\u201d Abbott said, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nWhile some mass shooting suspects have had diagnosed mental health issues, studies have found many others did not. Gun-control advocates have accused Abbott and other politicians of using mental health as a diversion to avoid discussions about gun control, including proposals for \u201cred flag\u201d laws.\n\nSeventeen states and the District have enacted laws allowing extreme-risk protection orders, which let authorities take away firearms from people suspected of being a danger to themselves or others. In other states, GOP lawmakers are blocking red-flag bills in favor of proposed changes to mental health laws or funding.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, for example, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rob Kauffman (R), announced last month he won\u2019t take up red-flag legislation amid calls from gun rights activists and state GOP lawmakers to instead push for new mental health laws, including more institutionalization.\n\nNico Bocour, state legislative director at the group Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence, said gun-control advocates need to do a better job fighting back against Republicans\u2019 attempts to use mental health legislation to overshadow the gun debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly access to guns, by people, that is the root cause of gun violence in our country,\u201d Bocour said.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers (D) and Democratic legislative leaders proposed their own version of a red-flag law last month. But Republicans who control the legislature, including Tittl, are instead pursuing bills aimed at shoring up Wisconsin\u2019s mental health system.\n\nTittl argues that the Republican proposals \u2014 incentives for psychologists to start practices in underserved communities and tax credits for community-based, outpatient mental health facilities \u2014 are not in response to Democrats\u2019 push for tougher gun laws. Instead, he said, Wisconsin Republicans are seeking to address constituents\u2019 concerns about the quality of care in a state that has been ravaged by substance abuse and growing suicide rates.\n\n\u201cI really believe that mental health is in the forefront of people\u2019s minds, because all of a sudden they realize, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s in my family. It\u2019s someone I go to church with, or someone I interact with day after day,\u201d Tittl said. \u201cThe myth that we are just caring now, because of guns, is ridiculous \u2014 we cared all along.\u201d\n\n[White House weighs controversial plan on mental illness and mass shootings]\n\nThere are differences within the party on the best way to approach the issue. At least in Wisconsin, Tittl said, he and other GOP legislators see community-based care as a more humane and fiscally wise approach than Trump\u2019s call for more institutionalization.\n\nBut Wisconsin mental health advocates worry that GOP leaders are not doing enough to produce real improvement in the system, including ramping up funding after years of relative stagnation.\n\nMany state governments froze or cut funding for mental health programs during the recession and have been slow to restore it. When adjusted for inflation and population growth, states in 2015 were spending less on mental health than they did in 1981, according to a study last year by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute.\n\nUnder Wisconsin\u2019s previous governor, Republican Scott Walker, total funding for mental health increased by about $87 million over his two terms in office, according to state health officials. But Walker refused to expand Medicaid, which would have extended coverage to residents who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Walker instead expanded a state subsidized health-care plan that capped participation at 100 percent of the poverty limit, which left an estimated 81,000 residents underinsured.\n\n\u201cThere has been heightened awareness about the need to support mental health and substance abuse services as the needs continue to rise,\u201d said Martina Gollin-Graves, president of Mental Health America of Wisconsin, an advocacy group. \u201cBut it\u2019s a Band-Aid, because we did not accept the Medicaid expansion, and that has limited access to those who needed it and continue to do so.\u201d\n\nLast year, voters in rural western Wisconsin signaled just how important the mental health crisis is to them.\n\nIn a December special election, Democrat Patty Schachtner won a state Senate seat after campaigning on mental health, flipping a district that Trump had carried by 17 points. On the campaign trail, she used her experiences as a death investigator for the medical examiner and a school health-care provider to connect with voters and stress the need for more government funding for mental health services, including for children affected by the region\u2019s drug epidemic.\n\n\u201cFor the longest time, mental illness hasn\u2019t been looked at as a disease,\u201d Schachtner said. \u201cBut now it is finally being looked at as, \u2018Geez, this is part of the human body and the brain, and maybe we should treat it as a medical condition.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut effective treatment, Schachtner said, will take money. And that is why she remains skeptical that her Republican colleagues are ready to stay in the fight for the long term, considering their anti-tax philosophy.\n\n\u201cNo matter who you are, you are there for a reason,\u201d said Schachtner, referring to the Capitol in Madison. \u201cIf your reason is not to pay as much taxes, you are not going to focus on issues that have human impacts.\u201d\n\nQuorum data contributed to this report.
