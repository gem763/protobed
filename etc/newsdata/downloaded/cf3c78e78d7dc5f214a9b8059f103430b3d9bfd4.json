(Lynne Sladky)\n\nThe U.S. economy added a modest 136,000 jobs in September, in what is likely to be interpreted as further evidence that the country is headed for a slowdown.\n\nThe pace is well-below average monthly growth last year, though the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year-low of 3.5 percent.\n\nManufacturing has already entered a decline and consumer spending is also appearing to soften, after more than a year of strength. The new report, issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that the economy lost 2,000 manufacturing jobs in September.\n\nThe National Retail Federation warned Thursday that economic uncertainty, new tariffs and fluctuations in the stock market could derail Americans\u2019 spending plans in the run-up to the holidays.\n\nAnd economists point to other signs, including a manufacturing recession as affecting employers as they struggle to find workers in a tight jobs market.\n\nSome other sectors performed much better, however, as health care and business services added more than 70,000 jobs combined.\n\nPresident Trump is trying to focus part of his 2020 reelection campaign on the strength of the economy, and he immediately cheered a part of the jobs report that noted how the unemployment rate had fallen despite other weak data.\n\nBreaking News: Unemployment Rate, at 3.5%, drops to a 50 YEAR LOW. Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!). \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nWage growth also appeared to have stalled a bit, rising just 2.9 percent in the past 12 months. As the unemployment rate has fallen to historic lows, economists have watched wage data closely to see if a tight labor market would eventually lead to higher income levels.\n\nBut a prime focus, both for business leaders and political leaders, continues to be the slump in manufacturing.\n\nSeptember was the worst month for U.S. manufacturing since June 2009, according to a closely watched industry index. And concerns have grown that the manufacturing contraction could spill over into other industries. Economists have begun warning about a significant risk of a recession.\n\n[Trump is heading into reelection with a deep manufacturing recession]\n\nMonthly job growth averaged 223,000 in 2018 but has fallen this year to 161,000. The economy is a subject of particularly intense scrutiny heading into an election year.\n\nHeather Long contributed to this report.", "description": "The pace is well-below average monthly growth last year, though the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year-low of 3.5 percent.", "authors": ["Eli Rosenberg", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "October At Am", "Eli Rosenberg Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S General Assignment Team.
