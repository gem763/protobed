The first evening, it was in Bangkok, we lost sight of each other for a couple of minutes.\n\n'He freaked out and he started to call my name and people were laughing at him and so when he saw me - it was only two or three minutes - he was having some kind of outburst because he said I did it on purpose and I was laughing at him and he was yelling and shouting.\n\n'I felt terrible because we were supposed to stay in Thailand for almost two weeks and I didn't know how I was supposed to get through all this time with him.'\n\nToday Lewes Crown Court (pictured above) heard that Kerr had sent Ms Vanthof a series of unwanted texts and emails\n\nShe said he got kicked out of their hotel after threatening to drown her near the end of their trip in Phuket, Thailand.\n\nShe said: 'Paul Kerr was screaming, shouting, threatening me, and throwing stuff. He threw a cup of coffee against a wall. He destroyed his own phone and he said he would drown me in a swimming pool.\n\n'One or two hours before that Kerr was swimming naked in the sea and he asked me to throw his towel and I was joking and said 'no, I won't' and then he got this outburst again and he walked out of the water.\n\n'He got his bag, took his stuff and left me once again standing on my own in Thailand.'\n\nShe said the rest of their trip back to Paris was 'awkward' and was made one or two days longer because of an Air France strike.\n\nAfter that he started sending her unwanted texts, emails, voice call messages and Facebook messages.\n\nShe said: 'Sometimes it was okay, but most of the time he was bullying, threatening me.\n\n'He was sending me many emails with lies, lying about me. He was always copying other people on these emails and I soon told him just to leave me alone and to cease all contact.\n\n'He began to claim for all the money for all the restaurants he paid. He wanted to pay half. He began to claim back for the hotel in Winchester. It started in Thailand.\n\n'Everytime I wanted to pay something for him he didn't accept it or if I wanted to pay it was already paid. He bought me lots of things; even for a bouquet of flowers he asked me for half of the money back.\n\n'And then there was this first email that he sent to my employer, I'm working on a university campus in my home town, that's in Caen, Normandy.'\n\nShe said she blocked him on Facebook and also blocked his email address, but added that he just created other accounts.\n\n'I felt terrible. I thought 'what can I do to make him stop?'\n\n'I ignored him, but he just continued. I couldn't concentrate anymore on my work. I couldn't sleep anymore because the tone became worse and worse.\n\nKerr, of Brighton, East Sussex, is also accused of threatening to hang two married 'superfans' of the rock band off Brighton Pier due to his 'bitterness and hatred' of his rock star sibling.\n\nHe allegedly stalked them, causing repeated fear of violence between January and November last year after Mr Fagan replied to Kerr, calling his brother's new album 'pure s***' on his own Facebook page.\n\nJurors have heard he threatened to repeatedly accuse Mr Fagan of being a child rapist online and threatened to hang and cripple him, as well as insult his wife who accused him of threatening to rape her.\n\nHe claims John and Julie Fagan, of Canterbury, Kent, conspired with Ms Vanthof to frame him with fake Facebook profiles.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Paul Kerr (pictured) is said to have threatened to drown Elizabeth Vanthof at a pool in Thailand and is also alleged to have demanded she give him back half of the gifts he had given her.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20292602-0-image-a-7_1572288029342.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
