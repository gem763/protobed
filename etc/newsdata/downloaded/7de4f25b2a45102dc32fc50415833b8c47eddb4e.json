The new powertrain is dubbed \u201cPlaid\u201d and is \u201cabout a year away from production,\u201d Musk tweeted Wednesday. (Both names are a reference to the Mel Brooks movie Spaceballs.) The Plaid Model S made its debut at Laguna Seca raceway, where it lapped the famous California road course in just 1 minute and 36 seconds.\n\nThe new Plaid powertrain, which employs three electric motors instead of two, will be available in the Model S, Model X, and the second-generation Roadster. It won\u2019t be available for the Model 3 or the Model Y, Musk said. It will \u201ccost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors,\u201d he added, a possible reference to the newly-unveiled Porsche Taycan Turbo, which starts at $150,000. (Though the new Roadster starts at $200,000.)\n\nAs Tesla pointed out on Twitter, 96 seconds is about one second faster than the \u201crecord for a four-door sedan\u201d at Laguna Seca. But this is where things get tricky. A spokesperson for Laguna Seca told CNBC that track officials \u201cwere not officiating while the Tesla was testing,\u201d and that \u201c[o]fficial records only happen during sanctioned events where a sanctioning body is officiating.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fast lap, but it\u2019s not really an official record\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty standard approach when it comes to track records, though it didn\u2019t stop Musk from claiming on Twitter that Tesla had set the new \u201crecord for fastest 4 door ever at Laguna Seca.\u201d The Silicon Valley automaker also posted a video of the run to YouTube titled \u201cTesla Model S Fastest Lap at Laguna Seca.\u201d The semantic confusion of this wording is cleared up in the video description: \u201cWe lapped Laguna Seca in 1:36.555 during advanced R&D testing of our Model S Plaid powertrain and chassis prototype \u2014 a second faster than the record for a four-door sedan.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the Model S lap is nowhere near the fastest Laguna Seca lap. That was officially set by Helio Castroneves in 2000 in a Champ Car, the racecars that briefly existed after Indy Racing League split off from IndyCar (don\u2019t ask). Back then, Castroneves put down a lap time of 1 minute 7 seconds. (The unofficial record, 1 minute 5 seconds, was set in 2012 in a Ferrari F1 car.)\n\nTesla is also running a Model S around another famous race track this week: Germany\u2019s N\u00fcrburgring. Musk announced last week that the company would take a Model S there in an apparent response to the news that Porsche\u2019s Taycan Turbo had set the \u201cfour door electric sports car\u201d lap record, which is another arguably made-up record.\n\nBut Tesla isn\u2019t attempting to break any records at N\u00fcrburgring just yet. Musk later tweeted that the company plans to \u201creview & tune\u201d the Model S for safety before going all-out there. (Which may be a good thing, since it seems Tesla may be running a lemon law buyback Model S.) Tesla also won\u2019t have the track to itself, because it will be making the run during a session where multiple automakers are allowed to test.\n\nTesla\u2019s Model S N\u00fcrburgring runs will be the closest thing we get to an actual head-to-head competition between the two cars until more Taycans make it into the real world. It\u2019s a matchup many performance car fans have anticipated during the four years Porsche spent hyping its flagship EV. On paper, the Taycan isn\u2019t as quick as Tesla\u2019s best Model S \u2014 and it also starts at $150,900, which some might say is ludicrous in its own right.", "description": "Tesla teased a prototype Model S that Elon Musk says can go faster than the \"Ludicrous\" speed the company\u2019s cars currently achieve.
