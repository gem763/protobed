Lagarde was unavailable for comment. When asked in his last news conference as ECB president last week about the dissent over restarting bond purchases, Draghi said disagreement was unavoidable and the bank has stuck to its mandate of keeping euro zone prices stable.\n\n\"Ultimately it's the reality that speaks more strongly than any other voice,\" said Draghi. \"It's the reality together with the conviction that we did what we did always in pursuing our mandate. If anything, that's a distinctive thing.\"\n\nThe most dramatic public schism occurred last month, when the ECB agreed to resume government bond purchases in an effort to kickstart fading economic growth and nudge up inflation to its target of just below 2%.\n\nMore than a third of policymakers objected, the biggest dissent Draghi faced in eight years at the head of an organization that traditionally strives for consensus.\n\nECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger quit, having unsuccessfully argued for years that the ECB's stimulus measures are excessive, possibly even stretching the bank\u2019s mandate. She declined to comment.\n\nThe central bank chiefs of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, who tend to favour more conservative monetary policy, all rebuked the decision to restart bond purchases, which would increase the ECB's existing 2.6 trillion euro pile of bonds.\n\nDraghi's allies say more discussion within the ECB likely would not have changed any outcomes.\n\n\"Mario Draghi has been fulfilling his obligations very well in very difficult circumstances,\" Finnish central bank chief Erkki Liikanen told Reuters. \"I give him my support and I'm sure history will show he was right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDAMAGING LEAKS\n\nThe public disagreement last month, followed by damaging leaks of confidential staff opinions opposed to restarting the purchase of bonds, set off doubt among investors about the ECB's commitment to the plan.\n\nMarket-based interest rates have actually risen since the bank's rate cut in September, as some investors now doubt the bank's readiness to stick to its plan and cut rates further if necessary.\n\nThe crescendo of doubt forced French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who opposed the restarting of bond purchases, to make the highly unusual move two weeks ago of pledging that the September decision would be carried out in full. He declined comment for this story.\n\nBut the damage was already done.\n\n\"The noisy objections weakened confidence in our resolve, so they actually damaged the policy,\" one current policymaker said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Mario Draghi will leave a more united euro zone when he steps down as president of the European Central Bank this week, but he hands over a body more publicly divided than ever on how best to resurrect an ailing regional economy.
