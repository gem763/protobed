Long Live Lizzie!!!\u2019\n\nHey now hey nowwww (Picture: Disney)\n\nThe new Lizzie McGuire series sees our teen protagonist (played by Hilary) all grown up and living in New York in her 30s.\n\nHowever, it seems she will be returning to California soon enough to rejoin her mum Jo (Hallie Todd), dad Sam (Robert Carradine) and brother Matt (Jake Thomas).\n\nLizzie McGuire only ran for two seasons \u2013 but 65 episodes \u2013 from 2001 until 2004, but had a huge fanbase, which was only boosted with the release of The Lizzie McGuire Movie in 2003.\n\nThe show followed Lizzie, a 13-year-old girl, as she navigated family drama, first crushes and school with her best friends Gordo (Adam Lamberg) and Miranda (Lalaine) \u2013 with an animated version of Lizzie sharing her innermost thoughts.\n\nThe reboot, however, will see Lizzie as a 30-year-old, with Hilary \u2013 who is now a mum-of-two \u2013 telling E! News: \u2018What are the struggles of a 30-year-old right nowWhat are the pressures that life throws in front of a woman who is 30 and doesn\u2019t have all the things yet?\u2019\n\nSadly, despite their kiss at the end of the movie, Lizzie and Gordo aren\u2019t together anymore \u2013 but Hilary is hopeful Adam will be joining the other OG members of the cast at some point.\n\nShe told Vulture: \u2018I really hope he\u2019s going to be involved. We\u2019ve been planning out the season and coming up with what everything looks like, and it\u2019s so important for him to be there for part of it.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
