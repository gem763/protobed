The inquest heard Kirsty was a regular drinker.\n\nMr Wilson said Kirsty \"made no threats to commit suicide or anything of that nature\" and her death \"wouldn't have been anticipated\" in the circumstances.\n\nThere was no evidence to suggest third party involvement or suspicious circumstances.\n\nDuring her funeral at Derby Cathedral in January, Kirsty's sister paid tribute to her \"best friend\".\n\n(Image: Derbyshire Live)\n\n(Image: Derbyshire Live)\n\nShe said: \"I can't believe we are here to say goodbye to you. You were my only sibling and my best friend. I never imagined life without you.\n\n\"I love you, Kirsty, and I'm so sorry for anything I ever did to upset you, and I just hope you will forgive me.\n\n\"Remembering you is easy, I do it every day, but missing you is a heartache that will never go away.\"\n\nThe hearse carried a floral tribute that said \"Mum\".\n\nAt the inquest, Kirsty's doctor said she suffered with a depressive disorder and had been taking antidepressant medication, but had denied being suicidal.\n\nShe had been advised not to drink while taking the medication.\n\nTexts found on her mobile phone indicated her \"low mood\" and that Kirsty, who was unemployed, was \"struggling financially\", but they were not sent directly before her life.\n\nAssistant coroner Louise Pinder concluded that this was an act of suicide.\n\nFor confidential support, the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock 365 days a year on 116 123.", "description": "An inquest heard Kirsty Davey was intoxicated and had been taking anti depressants, and was found by her partner in Chaddesden, Derby", "authors": ["Rachel Sutherland", "Pippa Allen-Kinross", "Image", "Davey Family", "Derbyshire Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564676.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NSR_TEM_20122018kirstydavey01_result.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
