To see the pairing you will need a clear south-western horizon, which may take some effort for city dwellers to find. However, having secured a good vantage point, the sight will be well worth it. The chart shows the view looking in this direction at 18:00 GMT on 31 October. The moon will be a tiny waxing crescent with just 15% of its surface illuminated. Jupiter will be an unmistakably bright and steady white point of light near the horizon. After this encounter, the moon will continue through its orbit, growing into a fatter crescent as sunlight illuminates more of the nearside surface. The moon will move on towards Saturn, which is sitting just above the setting \u201cteapot\u201d of Sagittarius. It will lie to the west of Saturn on 1 November, and to the east of the planet a day later.\n\nTopics", "description": "The moon, just entering its first quarter, comes into conjunction with the bright and steady giant planet near the south-western horizon", "authors": ["Stuart Clark"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51f3a82cf097de8b9e8675b0238a20a8197c0d0/4_2_560_336/master/560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b51a7367b3b2816bd04a9224b31e24e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
