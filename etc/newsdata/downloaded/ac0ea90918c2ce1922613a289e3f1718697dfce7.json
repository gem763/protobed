Both Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported last week that company is aiming for a valuation at or near $2 trillion. But Aramco\u2019s banking team \u2014 led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs (GS) \u2014 believe a $1.5 trillion price tag is more realistic, The Journal reported.\n\nA valuation above $2 trillion \u201cis an aspirational goal by the Saudis, but isn\u2019t justified at today\u2019s oil prices or the values being placed on oil and gas reserves by the financial markets,\u201d according to Dan Pickering, founder and CIO of Pickering Energy Partners.\n\nAramco\u2019s efforts to get top dollar for its offering could be stymied by a range of extenuating factors \u2014 which include soft oil prices, decelerating global growth, internal and external challenges to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman rule, and the Middle East\u2019s perpetual turmoil that raise pointed questions about oil security.\n\n\u201cAramco would have to dramatically change their operating cost structure, governance and/or dividend policy to achieve a premium valuation that would result in a $2 trillion value,\u201d he said.\n\nA view shows the damaged site of Saudi Aramco oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia October 12, 2019. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov More\n\nThe company is planning to list its shares on the local Saudi Arabian exchange before pursuing an international listing. However, the accumulated weight of all the issues facing the company are likely to weigh heavily on the minds of potential buyers of its stock when it eventually offers stock to world investors \u2014 a key staple of bin Salman\u2019s efforts to liberalize and diversify Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy.\n\nConversely, a local market placement \u201cincreases the odds of a higher valuation as the local investors and smaller trading float could create a fear-of-missing-out dynamic,\u201d Pickering added.\n\n\u2018A lot of questions\u2019\n\nAramco\u2019s public offering was initially floated over three years ago, but was shelved in 2018 as Wall Street questioned where the company could comply with stringent governance standards associated with international listings, and how much investors were willing to pay.\n\n\u201cThere are just a lot of questions hanging over\u201d the Aramco offering, Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment strategy at SLC Management, which has $160 billion in assets under management, told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.\n\nMullarkey called the Aramco offering \u201cnot that compelling\u201d based on fundamentals, and \u201cnot something we\u2019d get super excited over\u201d for several reasons.\n\n\u201cFor decades people have felt that infrastructure in Saudi Arabia has been well protected, well guarded and the risk of interruptions [were] minimal,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many of assumptions were upended by September\u2019s drone attack, which exposed vulnerabilities in Saudi Arabia\u2019s infrastructure. In the wake of lingering security concerns sparked by an attack widely suspected to have been engineered by Iran \u2014 Saudi Arabia\u2019s chief regional antagonist \u2014Mullarkey suggested there would be \u201cpushback\u201d from investors that may take it out on Aramco\u2019s valuation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to tie down open questions themselves as opposed to investors handicapping the offering,\u201d he added. Left unanswered, those vulnerabilities could in extremis, cost Aramco a 15 to 20% discount in value, Mullarkey said.", "description": "Saudi Aramo is forging ahead with IPO plans that may value the company at $2 trillion, as investors weigh the risks associated with the offering.", "authors": ["Javier E.
