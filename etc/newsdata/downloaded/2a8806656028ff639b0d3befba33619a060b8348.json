You may be tempted to jump to any number of conclusions about what happened \u2014 the rider was careless, the horse was not sufficiently trained. But if you look closer, you\u2019ll see the real problem: There was a snake in the grass.\n\nWhether one supports or opposes the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE, we should all agree that we need to avoid that snake in the grass \u2014 in this case, demonization of the other side. Former UN Ambassador Susan Rice said it best in an appearance on MSNBC last week: The biggest threat to our national security is domestic political divisions.\n\nUnfortunately, what we have seen thus far are conversations packed with vitriol. Recently, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) stated that the president needs to be \u201cimprisoned and placed in solitary confinement.\u201d Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, meanwhile, said \u201cWhat we are in the middle of now, folks, is a Cold Civil War,\u201d in describing how he sees Democrats\u2019 approach to the president. This kind of rhetoric doesn\u2019t just throw gas on the fire. It throws a tanker truck on it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile it may be tempting to become absorbed by the disdain and cynicism that fuels our politics and the growing arguments over impeachment, Susan Rice\u2019s comments about the impact of our political divides reinforce what we have believed for years: We must stop demonizing those with whom we disagree and shift our default model for public discourse from immediately degrading the other side to engaging with them respectfully to better understand their positions and why they hold them.\n\nThat means opening our thinking to accept facts that might not fit our narratives. It means disciplining ourselves not to let our favorite pundits reinforce our views without questioning if they are supported by facts. By doing those things, we can engage in more productive, less tense conversations with others about the serious issue of impeachment \u2014 an important consideration as the holiday season approaches.\n\nThe openness to facts and resistance to demonization are attributes of what we call \u201ccommon grounders.\u201d We describe common grounders as those seeking points of agreement on social and political issues through listening and productive conversation. Rather than shutting down friends or family members with differing opinions, common grounders listen to others in order to understand them. The goal is not necessarily to come to an agreement, but to have a discussion based on facts, not insults. There will be much less risk of damaging relationships and you will be setting an example for others about what good looks like when it comes to political conversations.\n\nWhile much of the discussion in D.C. has been toxic, there have been some politicians willing to favor facts over rhetoric. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) caused an uproar when he appeared to support an impeachment inquiry. While he later clarified those remarks, he still insisted we \u201chave to respect the process.\u201d Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) promised her constituents that she would \u201clook at the facts as they come and... do what my conscience calls me to do.\u201d\n\nReps Amodei and Slotkin aren\u2019t the only examples of politicians avoiding the trap of demonization. Recently, former Secretaries of State John Kerry John Forbes KerryRomney earns rants and raves for secret Twitter name Overnight Energy: Farmers say EPA reneged on ethanol deal | EPA scrubs senators' quotes from controversial ethanol announcement | Perry unsure if he'll comply with subpoena | John Kerry criticizes lack of climate talk at debate John Kerry calls out lack of climate questions at debate MORE and Condoleezza Rice shared a stage during a forum hosted in part by Common Ground Committee, the nonprofit we founded dedicated to bringing light, not heat, to public discourse. The leaders passionately but respectfully discussed high-stakes issues from North Korea to climate change and even found points of consensus.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll of these examples serve as models for our own public discourse as we continue to move deeper into the impeachment process.\n\nWe also implore media professionals to make a more concerted effort to not amplify party feuds and follies just for views and clicks. According to a late-2018 Gallup poll, only 45 percent of Americans trust that mass media reports the news \u201cfully, accurately and fairly.\u201d Journalists are supposed to be a check on government power, but fanning the flames of hostility for ratings and subscriptions makes it harder for people to thoughtfully assess the situation.\n\nThe snake in the grass that is demonization will always be present, but it\u2019s within our power to avoid it.\n\nAs the impeachment inquiry continues, let us not become victims of its bite. Instead, refuse to demonize those with differing opinions. Sincerely seek to remain open to accepting facts as they become available, and to understand our associates, friends and family who disagree with us on the impeachment question.\n\nThis way we can heal the anger and polarization that pits us against each other and, as Susan Rice has warned, opens us up to trouble at the hands of America\u2019s adversaries.\n\nBruce Bond, a 30-year veteran of the information technology industry, is co-founder of the Common Ground Committee, a citizen-led initiative focused on demonstrating productive public discourse.
