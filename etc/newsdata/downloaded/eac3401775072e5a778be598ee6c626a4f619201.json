The video was posted online and sparked protests on campus.\n\nJarred Karal and Ryan Mucaj, both 21, were arrested and charged with \u201cridicule on account of creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality, or race,\u201d UConn spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz announced on Monday as students and staff alike demanded \u201caccountability.\u201d\n\nThe two white students had played a game where they uttered vulgar words at increasing volume as they walked through the campus parking lot, progressing to racial slurs as they ran out of profanities.\n\n@UConn@UConnHuskies This is what your students of color hear when they open their windows pic.twitter.com/n5iUt2yk6W \u2014 D\ud83c\udf92 (@Heavy_D18) October 11, 2019\n\nThey were filmed from a nearby residence saying \u201cn****r\u201d back and forth at each other five times; the slur was barely audible in the recording, but became a major campus issue after it was posted on Twitter.\n\nStudents gathered to protest just hours before the arrest was announced, insisting \u201cit\u2019s more than just a word.\u201d The student newspaper excoriated administrators for not responding more quickly to the 11-second video, which was posted on October 11. Their rage was compounded by another alleged racial discrimination incident at a campus fraternity party in which a student claimed two members called her a racial slur.\n\nThe UConn chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has demanded that the fraternity is disbanded. Additionally, the school must update its hate speech code, hire new black members of staff, and adopt a mandatory diversity course, lest it \u201ccreate a culture in which racism is tolerated and normalized,\u201d the group warned in a letter published in the student paper. UConn president Thomas Katsouleas has hurried to appease the angry students, putting out a hiring call for a diversity officer.\n\nAlso on rt.com US university racism workshop returns, just NINE students come to learn about white privilege\n\nKarl and Mucaj face a maximum $50 fine, 30 days in jail, or both under state law, and the school is looking into whether they violated its code of conduct, which could see them expelled.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
