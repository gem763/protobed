Ford's annual health care expenses similarly are expected to top $1 billion. New union contracts with the same terms would instantly balloon those figures.\n\nThe bottom line: UAW members are potentially keeping their generous medical and drug coverage, which is what they wanted, but that inherently means GM allotted less money for their paychecks. Hospitals, doctors and other health care companies also benefit because automakers have signaled they are willing to pay them top dollar.", "description": "UAW workers and the health care industry will benefit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/uceh-wCBy6sUrF_BmHEmZaQnwZQ=/0x139:4000x2389/1920x1080/2019/10/17/1571331357621.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
