Apple's factory is accused of underpaying workers and forcing them to work in harsh conditions.\n\nOne of the most glaring laws broken involved temporary employees or \"dispatch workers,\" according to the report. Chinese laws require that only 10% of the company's employee base be dispatch workers; however, Foxconn's labor force was made up of about 50%.\n\nApple, which will likely unveil its new iPhone on Tuesday, has denied most of the allegations. More\n\nUnlike full-time employed workers, dispatch workers do not receive paid sick leave and social insurance for medical expenses, CLW said. The report also accused Apple's factory of paying base wages \"insufficient to sustain the livelihood for a family\" living in the area.\n\nAfter conducting an internal investigation, the tech giant said in a statement that it found the \u201cpercentage of dispatch workers exceeded our standards\u201d and that it is \u201cworking closely with Foxconn to resolve this issue.\u201d\n\niOS 13: 13 hidden ways Apple's new software can breathe life into your aging iPhone\n\nCLW's report alleges that workers have said they are exposed to toxic chemicals every day.\n\n\"When they are sick, they are still forced to work overtime; managers verbally abuse workers on a regular basis and sometimes punish workers by asking them to stand,\" according to CLW's report. \"Some female workers have even experienced sexual harassment while working on the production lines.\"\n\nApple said that its workers are \"being compensated appropriately\" and \"there was no evidence of forced labor.\"\n\n\"We looked into the claims by China Labor Watch, and most of the allegations are false,\" Apple told USA TODAY in an emailed statement. \"We believe everyone in our supply chain should be treated with dignity and respect. When we find issues, we work with our suppliers to take immediate corrective action.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Apple has come under fire for reportedly exploiting labor laws.\n\nIn 2017, the tech giant's suppliers were accused of tapping high schoolers to staff their factories in a scramble to meet the demand for the pricey iPhone X. And a 2013 labor audit reportedly found multiple cases of employment of underage workers, discrimination and wage problems.\n\nA year earlier, workers at the Foxconn factory went on strike over higher quality-control standards and having to work during an extended national holiday.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: iPhone 11: Is Apple still breaking labor laws in China?", "description": "Apple reportedly admits that its factory in China over-relied on temporary workers to build latest iPhones.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jPbtWhYlbuNfnXZpbGe1fQ--~B/aD05NzQ7dz0xNDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_tech_153/e563a813c08b407c688066ba750d57a9", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
