I'm very grateful for that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI feel much better about myself now and getting compliments from younger men and women sure boosts the self-esteem.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cMy husband started remarking about how good I looked, and my family was so proud of my efforts,\u201d she added.\n\nBut getting compliments from others \u2013 including much younger men \u2013 was not the biggest victory in MacDonald\u2019s weight loss journey. She was able to get off of all her medications, which she used to take for high blood pressure, high cholesterol and acid reflux, among other conditions.\n\nThough MacDonald has hit a much healthier weight for her age, she has no plans on slowing down \u2013 and even documents her journey through an Instagram account her daughter set up for her at Train With Joan.\n\n\u201cI have an easier time staying away from junk or fast foods and as for exercise, I will keep at it because there's always room for change and improvement,\u201d she said to Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cPeople are very complimentary and somewhat surprised that I've kept it off this long and I'm still changing; I have more muscle definition now than when I first lost the weight.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nBut she does have advice for others looking to shed weight, acknowledging on social media that it can be a struggle to keep up with her healthy lifestyle at times.\n\n\u201cFor those who truly feel at a loss, I'd say change one thing with your food intake and one exercise to do and each week add something new,\" she said. \"Don't expect miracles right away, take it slow and steady but keep building.\u201d", "description": "A grandmother is showing off her shredded physique after losing 55 pounds.", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Joan-MacDonald-3-MDW.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
