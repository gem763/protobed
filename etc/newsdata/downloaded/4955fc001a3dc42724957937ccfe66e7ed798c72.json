One almost apocalyptic'.\n\nToday he was found unanimously guilty of two offences he faced following more than seven hours deliberations at Liverpool Crown Court.\n\nJudge Thomas Teague, QC, told Blasio: 'You have been convicted of extremely serious offences by the jury who saw through the humbug of dishonesty with which you sought to deny them.'\n\nHis wife, Sonia, left the public gallery in floods of tears after the jury of seven men and five women delivered their guilty verdicts on the charges of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property and fraud involving an insurance claim he made after the blast.\n\nFiremen photographed surveying the devastation following the explosion in New Ferry, on the Wirral in March 2017\n\nMr Lawrence said that about 9.15pm on March 25, 2017 'the towns of New Ferry, Port Sunlight and Rock Ferry, together with many other parts of the Wirral peninsula, Merseyside and Cheshire were rocked by a huge explosion.\n\nHe told jurors that some were lucky to have escaped with their lives. 'It truly was a miracle that nobody was killed as a result of this explosion.'\n\nThe most seriously injured was Lewis Jones, 21, who 'was sadly, in the wrong place at the wrong time, sat outside the furniture shop in a bus stop.'\n\nHe suffered multiple skull and facial fractures, a serious brain injury and had to have part of his skull removed and sustained injuries to his lungs and kidney.\n\nProsecuting, Nigel Lawrence, QC said there was a 'truly chaotic scene in the aftermath of the explosion, one of complete and utter devastation. One almost apocalyptic'\n\nThe explosion which injured 81 people and caused 'utter devastation' was an insurance job which went 'badly wrong', a court heard\n\nMr Lawrence said: 'He has been left with serious, life-changing and significant ongoing problems and disability and he remains under the care of a consultant in neuro-rehabilitation and has not been able to work since the incident.'\n\nThe jury saw CCTV footage capturing the explosion, and an experienced police officer described 'a scene of devastation that he had only ever seen on news reports involving earthquakes or war zones from around the world'.\n\nThe prosecutor said that Blasio's Homes in Style shop was served with a main gas supply, via a gas pipe that ran into the property from the gas main in the road outside.\n\nThe jury saw CCTV footage capturing the explosion, and an experienced police officer described 'a scene of devastation that he had only ever seen on news reports'\n\nThe pipe had originally been connected to a gas meter, but this had been removed some years earlier. The pipe was capped off with a blanking cap.\n\nHe said: 'The blanking cap was deliberately removed, by hand using a tool, shortly before the explosion and the emergency control valve turned from its closed position to allow gas to escape into the furniture shop.\n\n'This deliberate act allowed gas to gradually fill the property. You will hear that gas has to mix with air to reach a combustible level at which it can ignite and explodes.'\n\nInvestigators believe an an electric fire found in the debris of the shop may have caused the ignition.\n\nCCTV images from the night of the explosion at Homes In Style store in New Ferry, Wirral show the intensity of the blast\n\nThe court heard that on the day of the explosion and day before witnesses saw furniture being moved from Blasio's store and also saw the shop was 'virtually empty' with a sign on the door saying it would be closed for three days.\n\nBut just two working days after the explosion a claim was made to the insurers for \u00a350,000 worth of furniture stock.\n\nBlasio, formerly of Wallasey, now of Gillingham, Kent, who has previous convictions for robbery and shop lifting, denied all the allegations. He now awaits sentencing.", "description": "Pascal Blasio, 57, destroyed or damaged 63 properties in the blast in the Wirral, also damaging vehicles and leaving people with lacerations, burns and psychological trauma.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/17/19701938-0-image-a-2_1571071350903.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
