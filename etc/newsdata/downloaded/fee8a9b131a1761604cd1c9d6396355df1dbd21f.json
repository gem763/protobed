But so what? It's just a minor sacrifice compared to them,\" he said.\n\nHe looks back at 2014 with fondness, saying it was the first time he had played a role in politics.\n\n\"We started out as nothing,\" he recalled.\n\nBut much of that optimism has since vanished.\n\n\"If we lose, Hong Kong will become Xinjiang,\" he said, referring to China's western, Muslim-majority region that is blanketed by a huge security clampdown.\n\n'WE WILL BE BACK'\n\nWhen protesters left their camps in mid-December 2014 after Beijing successfully waited out the movement and mainstream opinion tired of the disruption, activists chanted: \"We will be back!\".\n\nBut as the years went by, few expected that to happen.\n\nMany leaders of the movement were prosecuted and Beijing tightened the screws on critics.\n\nFive dissident booksellers disappeared into mainland custody, opposition lawmakers were disqualified, a small independence party was outlawed and a foreign journalist who hosted a talk with that party's leader was expelled.\n\nBut then the city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam tabled a now-scrapped bill proposing extraditions to the mainland, and the new democracy movement was reborn.\n\nHenry Wong, 22, was a secondary school student in 2014, and spent many days at the main camp outside parliament in the district of Admiralty.\n\n\"We saw how Hong Kongers united together in Admiralty and helped each other,\" he recalled. \"We all had a community that was caring and a lot of us felt that was an ideal city that we wanted to live in.\"\n\nNow a medical student, he has joined a team studying the effects of tear gas, with more than 3,000 canisters fired by police so far.\n\nLocal artist Perry Dino, 53, has sketched scenes from both movements, though he says it is a harder job now the protests are not static.\n\n\"I'm optimistic seeing that many Hong Kong people have come out on the streets fearless about being arrested, let alone enduring the sun and rain,\" he added.\n\nMedical student Wong said he retained a similar sense of hope even as China rejects further concessions.\n\n\"We have proved that after 2014, we have the strength to come back again,\" he said. \"No matter what is waiting for us ahead, we will be back and we will continue our fight\".\n\n\"We are stronger than before,\" added Bunny. \"We won't be easily worn down like in 2014.\"\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] From doing homework by torchlight to hurling flaming molotov cocktails at riot police: the character of Hong Kong's protests has changed dramatically in five years, with young demonstrators hardened by the failure of their peaceful Umbrella Movement. .
