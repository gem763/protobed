The Washington Post has catalogued more than 13,400 false or misleading claims that Trump has made during his presidency.\n\nSo what numbers do we know about his 1,000 days?\n\nWe might never know what portion of the border wall with Mexico is truly new construction or just upgrades. It's also too early to assess the broader impacts of removing the requirement to buy health insurance and the 2017 tax cut.\n\nWe don't even know exactly how many rounds of golf Trump has played \u2013 although we can take a guess.\n\nRegardless, we've gathered some numbers as striking as Spicer's flouncy, day-glo green shirt on \"Dancing With the Stars\" to put the Trump presidency in perspective.\n\nThe Cabinet\n\nSpicer's short tenure (six months) has not been uncommon at the upper ranks of the Trump administration. In addition to serving as press secretary, he's one of six people to serve as communication director. In fact, half of the Cabinet has changed since they joined the administration.\n\nCommunication\n\nSome of those White House departures have been announced in 140 characters or less. For better or worse, no other president has communicated as directly (and often) with the American people.\n\nNot even counting retweets, Trump has tweeted more than 8,900 times as president, according to Trump Twitter Archive. Yes, about 9 times a day, but his tweeting has more than doubled between 2017 and 2019.\n\nHis topics have famously ranged from insulting and badgering to announcing significant shifts in U.S. policy, but nothing has sparked as much interest with his Twitter audience as rapper A$AP Rocky's release in August. His top five tweets:\n\nLoading...\n\nEconomy\n\nWhether jawboning the Federal Reserve or touting the latest economic number, many of his tweets have touched on the economy. Just on Tuesday he proclaimed, \"We now have the greatest Economy in history!\" And, for the most part, the news has been encouraging for Americans. Jobs have continued to grow and along with stock-market portfolios. Some economists say, though, that Trump's trade war with China and other international concerns are beginning to weigh on the economy.\n\nJob approval\n\nRegardless of the economy's movements and his evolving policies, Trump's job approval remains relatively steady. RealClearPolitics has collected more than 900 polls asking Americans about the Trump administration. Throughout his presidency his job approval ratings have lagged his predecessors, including a drop below 40% after his inauguration, but his numbers have been relatively consistent. Here's a moving average of those hundreds of polls vs. Obama's first 1,000 days:\n\nJudges\n\nSome of Trump's consistent support may be attributable to delivering on a top conservative priority: pushing the courts to the right. That includes placing conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and 150 judges on other federal courts. According to Judiciary Tracker, only three other presidents (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter) added more judges in their first 1,000 days.\n\n\n\nThe Wall\n\nNo review of Trump's first 1,000 days would be complete without a discussion of his immigration policies and the wall he pledged to construct along the border with Mexico. There's not much new progress. Nearly all of the wall construction in the first 1,000 days has been replacement fencing. That's expected to change in the next year: Nearly 40% of the next 400 miles will likely be new barriers:", "description": "Eight charts \u2014 from the economy to his tweets to his administration \u2014 illuminate key aspects of Donald Trump's first 1,000 days.", "authors": ["Jim Sergent", "Javier Zarracina", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NkhK_tZ3hRa1Hi29hFk4Qw--~B/aD04NTM7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/0984e62305da32bdcac3e65ded6db3eb", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
