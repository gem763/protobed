Just weeks earlier, Charlie\u2019s Angels, in which Green appeared opposite his new fianc\u00e9e Drew Barrymore, debuted at No. 1 at the box office.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing thing to have gotten to do it,\u201d Green says of his SNL experience, 19 years later, on this week\u2019s episode of The Last Laugh podcast. However, he adds, \u201cI think if I could go back and do it again someday, I would do it a lot differently.\u201d\n\nWhen producer Lorne Michaels offered Green the chance to host that fall, the comedian insisted that his childhood friends from Canada, whom he had hired as writers on The Tom Green Show, come in for the week and help write sketches. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the politics of Saturday Night Live,\u201d he says, acknowledging that SNL\u2019s writers at the time, including Mike Schur, who would go on to create The Good Place, future Oscar nominee Adam McKay and head writer Tina Fey, may not have appreciated the input.\n\n\u201cI was aggressively trying to deconstruct everything that I encountered,\u201d Green explains. \u201cJust because I was a kid in my twenties and I was like, that\u2019s the way you do it. Let\u2019s try to take it apart and put it back together upside down and inside out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think in hindsight I would have rather just shown up and worked with everybody else and just kind of went with the flow a bit more,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I was young and passionate.\u201d Green says his friends ended up writing about half of the sketches that aired in his episode, including one in which he appeared in a bathtub with Lorne Michaels as well as his monologue and the final sketch of the night.\n\nGreen\u2019s big idea for the episode was a gag that would be teased at the beginning of the show and pay off in the final moments. His relationship with Barrymore was all over the tabloids and he thought it would be funny if they appeared together during his monologue and announced they would be getting married on live television at the end of his SNL debut.\n\n\u201cI try not to have regrets, but that is something that I actually regret,\u201d Green says. \u201cSo Drew and I actually were engaged at the time. So we thought, this will be a funny prank. We\u2019ll prank the audience. We\u2019ll tell everyone we\u2019re going to get married on SNL and then she won\u2019t show up at the altar at the end and that will be the punchline. Even though we were still getting married, like a month after. That was the bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the thing I regret about that bit to this day, which I\u2019m actually sad about, to be honest with you, is that the way we wrote the bit, we kept teasing that we were going to get married at the end of the show\u2014she\u2019s out in the hallway in her wedding dress, my parents are there in the audience,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd then at the end of the show, she doesn\u2019t show up. And the end of my SNL I have a meltdown on stage. And it\u2019s a complete meltdown and the band stops playing and the entire cast disappears and I\u2019m just standing alone on stage at the very end of the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cArtistically,\u201d Green still thinks it was a \u201cpretty awesome\u201d way to end the show. \u201cBut it does sort of ruin my beautiful Saturday Night Live kumbaya moment,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of every Saturday Night Live, [the host] is hanging out with the cast and celebrating together.\u201d But on his episode, it\u2019s just Green screaming \u201cI thought you loved me!\u201d on stage by himself.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s kind of a metaphor for the rebellious, naive kid that I was: \u2018We\u2019re going to go there and we\u2019re going to try to turn SNL upside down!\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut in other ways, I think it just sort of ruined my Saturday Night Live experience.\u201d He does add that he and Barrymore went to the after party with the cast and \u201chad a blast.\u201d\n\nGreen maintains that it was one of the highest-rated episodes that season \u201cbecause of\u201d the prank. \u201cIt was a massive success in that sense, because we did create a reason to stay up \u2019til the end,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to a Variety item from that week, the \u201ccancelation\u201d of the wedding was \u201csprung on Lorne Michaels only five minutes before the ceremony was to take place on camera\u201d and the show reportedly had a priest and City Hall license on hand. Caroline Kennedy, Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cameron Diaz, and Harvey Weinstein were among the celebrities waiting backstage to celebrate with the \u201cnewlyweds\u201d after the show.\n\nTo \u201cput it in perspective how crazy\u201d his life was at that time, Green tells me that the morning after Saturday Night Live aired, he and Barrymore got on a plane to London to have dinner with Prince Charles at St. James\u2019s Palace for the royal premiere of Charlie\u2019s Angels.\n\nGreen sat next to Camilla Parker Bowles at the dinner and had a two-hour conversation about \u201cstuff like France and organic farming\u201d among other topics. \u201cWas it a real mouse?\u201d Prince Charles asked Green of the infamous scene from Road Trip in which he attempts to feed a snake and ends up putting a live mouse in his mouth. The answer was yes.\n\nGreen and Barymore ultimately did get married in July of 2001 and were divorced less than nine months later. Green has called their marriage a \u201ccrazy whirlwind of a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was a bizarre time in my life,\u201d Green tells me. If he ever gets the chance to host SNL again, \u201cwhich would be nice,\u201d he says, \u201cI would love to be able to not bring my friends from high school in and not try to make it some crazy, warped episode.\u201d\n\nNearly two decades later, the 48-year-old comedian chalks the whole thing up to \u201cthe naivety of youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had been so hellbent on causing chaos everywhere I went that suddenly when I was where I was, I still was behaving as if I was living in my parents\u2019 basement,\u201d Green says. \u201cI should have probably taken certain opportunities to just be grateful that I was there. And I didn\u2019t realize that at the time.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Stand-up comedian and star of ABC\u2019s Black-ish and Grown-ish, Deon Cole.", "description": "At the height of his fame, Tom Green got the chance to host \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d He thinks he went about it all wrong.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569980449/191001-wilstein-tom-green-tease_eeaiib"}
