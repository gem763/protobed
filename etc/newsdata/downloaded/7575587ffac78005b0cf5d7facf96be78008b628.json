We will look to find another show with him, but I think it is unlikely it will go in the same slot.\u2019\n\nJeremy did break his silence in August to share the news Vicky was pregnant, having told their families and are \u2018delighted\u2019.\n\n\u2018Vick and I couldn\u2019t be happier to say we\u2019re expecting our first baby together. We\u2019ve told our families and everyone is delighted,\u2019 he said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to The Sun, he added: \u2018It\u2019s the best possible thing that could have happened and we\u2019re excited about preparing for his or her arrival in January.\u2019\n\nJeremy already has three daughters Harriet, 29, Alice, 15, Ava, 13, and one son Henry, 10, from previous marriages to Kirsty Rowley and Carla Germaine.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
