Mike Folmer\u2019s resignation.\n\nPREVIOUSLY:\n\nA Republican state senator in Pennsylvania was arrested late Tuesday on charges of child sexual abuse and child pornography, sparking immediate calls for his resignation, including from the state\u2019s governor.\n\nPolice arrested state Sen. Mike Folmer after finding images of child porn on a Tumblr account traced to him and on his iPhone, according to the criminal complaint filed by the office of state Attorney General Josh Shapiro (D).\n\nEarly Wednesday, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) called for Folmer\u2019s swift resignation.\n\n\u201cWe elect leaders to serve as a voice for those who do not have the ability to advocate for their own needs, demanding that they will protect our children, families, and communities. The charges against Senator Folmer are disgusting and beyond comprehension, and show he has taken advantage of the trust and privilege afforded by the people of Pennsylvania,\u201d Wolf said in a statement. \u201cHe should immediately resign.\u201d\n\nIn March, law enforcement officials began investigating Folmer, after Tumblr flagged the account in February, according to the criminal complaint. The account contained a photo of \u201ca very young female child performing fellatio on an adult male,\u201d uploaded in December of 2017. Investigators later found that the photo was uploaded by Folmer, tracing the account and associated email address back to him.\n\nOn Tuesday, police and the state attorney general\u2019s office carried out a search warrant at Folmer\u2019s home and found two more images on Folmer\u2019s iPhone, which \u201cdepicted indecent contact with a minor.\u201d\n\nFolmer\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Folmer admitted to police Tuesday that the Tumblr account and associated email address belonged to him, and \u201cthat he had been dealing with some personal problems/issues and that he had received child pornography through his Tumblr blog.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, GOP state Senate officials removed him as chair of the State Government Committee and said that \u201cfurther action in response to these charges will be taken by Senate leadership in the coming days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are shocked to learn tonight of the allegations made against Senator Folmer,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cWe will fully cooperate with law enforcement regarding this deeply disturbing matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis defendant serves as a state Senator and was entrusted to honor and represent his community in the Pennsylvania Capitol,\u201d Shapiro said in a statement announcing the charges. \u201cI will continue to say it \u2014 no one is above the law, no matter what position of power they hold.\u201d", "description": "Pennsylvania state Sen.
