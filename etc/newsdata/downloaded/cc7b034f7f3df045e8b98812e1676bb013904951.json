We will come out on October 31.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s parliament has repeatedly rejected the exit deal Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May negotiated with the EU, and this month rejected leaving without a deal - angering many Britons who voted to leave the bloc more than three years ago.\n\nJohnson has said he wants to negotiate a new deal that does not involve a \u2018backstop\u2019, which would potentially tie Britain against its will to EU rules after it leaves in order to avoid checks on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe EU has so far insisted on the backstop, and Britain has not presented any detailed alternative.\n\nNonetheless, Johnson said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very, very good conversation going on about how to address the issues of the Northern Irish border. A huge amount of progress is being made,\u201d Johnson told the Mail on Sunday, without giving details.\n\nJohnson drew parallels between Britain\u2019s situation in Brexit talks and the frustrations felt by fictional scientist Bruce Banner, who when enraged turned into The Incredible Hulk, frequently leaving behind a trail of destruction.\n\n\u201cBanner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, former Conservative minister Sam Gyimah said he was switching to the pro-EU Liberal Democrat party in protest at Johnson\u2019s Brexit policies and political style.\n\nOpinion polls late on Saturday painted a conflicting picture of the Conservative Party\u2019s political fortunes under Johnson, who wants to hold an early election to regain a working majority in parliament.\n\nA poll conducted by Opinium for the Observer newspaper showed Conservative support rose to 37% from 35% over the past week, while Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour held at 25% and Liberal Democrat support dropped to 16% from 17%. Support for Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party remained at 13%.\n\nHowever, a separate poll by ComRes for the Sunday Express put Conservative support at just 28%, down from 30% and only a shade ahead of Labour at 27%.\n\nComRes said just 12% of the more than 2,000 people it survey thought Britain\u2019s parliament could be trusted to do the right thing for the country.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to the unruly comic book character The Incredible Hulk late on Saturday in a newspaper interview where he stressed his determination to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429894479&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0RI", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
