We know this because he wore his uniform in the first episode and actually took Hannah flying during hometown dates (oh, and all the many, many flying puns that have taken place over the season). So who does Peter Weber fly for, and is he a full pilot? Here's what we know about Peter's profession.\n\nPeter is a commercial pilot.\n\nMost people think he's a private pilot, since he flew a private plane with Hannah over his house and hometown of Westlake Village. However, Peter is actually a commercial pilot. I believe his family has (or at least rents) a private plane according to his Instagram:\n\nSo, clearly he has an awareness of all different types of planes. But his full-time job is with an airline you might recognize...\n\nHe accepted an offer to fly with Delta.\n\nIn March 2018, he accepted an offer to fly with Delta, so it's been nearly a year and a half since then.\n\nAnd previously he worked for Compass Airlines (which is a regional airline).\n\nSince he's been home post-show, according to his Instagram, he's been back and flying for Delta:\n\nYou can expect his season of The Bachelor to be filled with references to his job and to Delta (you know, when the women aren't making windmill puns). Prior to being announced as the lead of The Bachelor, Peter had posted a number of Instagram photos referencing Delta and his job there, so Delta is clearly okay with playing a role in this season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis dad's a pilot too.\n\nIn sources talking to Reality Steve, it's very unusual for someone that young to be a full captain at such a young age (Peter is 27), although the timeline can be condensed with a regional airline. Sources insinuated that Peter might have had a helping hand from his pilot father, but there's no verification that this happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nEither way, let's take a moment for what's really important: What Peter looks like in full uniform.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter.\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Peter is actually a (very young) commercial pilot.", "authors": ["Katherine J Igoe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0FoeCFyFeohcc4NqFodGzQ--~B/aD0yNzA7dz01Mzk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/3ae5b50e6d9212ce7c6ae40d203d30f9", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
