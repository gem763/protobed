Read more: https://zd.net/2NdaomS\n\nJust in time for the holidays, Apple has announced the AirPods Pro. The new wireless earbuds look similar to the standard AirPods, but they have a revamped design, noise-cancellation, and improved sound quality.\n\nAirPods Pro is available to order right now for $249. You can purchase them in Apple Stores starting Oct. 30, the same day orders will begin shipping.\n\nAirPods Pro uses two microphones for noise cancellation that automatically change and adapt each earbud, blocking out background noise -- a feature users and reviewers have complained about the regular AirPods lacking since their launch.\n\n(Image: Apple, Inc.)\n\nThe AirPods Pro will also have a new transparency mode that makes it possible to listen to music -- along with hearing the ambient noise from your surroundings. This is helpful if you're listening to music in an airport but also want to hear any gate change or boarding announcements.\n\nBy using the same H1 chip that's used in the second-generation AirPods, the AirPods Pro will have up to five hours of battery life when listening to music, or four and a half when noise-cancellation is turned on. The wireless charging case can recharge the earbuds, too, providing up to 24 hours of listening time in total.\n\nThe AirPods Pro are also sweat- and water-resistant, according to Apple.\n\nIf you've been holding out for new AirPods, do the AirPods Pro look appealing? Or, if you already own AirPods, are the new features enough to warrant an upgrade? Let us know in the comments.\n\nDisclosure: ZDNet may earn a commission from some of the products featured on this page.", "description": "The new wireless earbuds from Apple are available to order right now and will be available in stores on Oct. 30.", "authors": ["Jason Cipriani"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/28/fb5bb26c-a410-4801-873e-a7a73eb19c7f/thumbnail/770x578/f335dbfe0fb2d75bbadfa2a1177fba79/apple-airpods-pro-new-design-case-and-airpods-pro-102819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
