Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) formally endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on Saturday and explained why she did not instead endorse a female candidate, arguing that it is about the \u201cfeminist values of the campaign\u201d \u2013 not gender.\n\nThe New York lawmaker formally endorsed Sanders at a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d in New York on Saturday, crediting him for helping her recognize her \u201cinherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education, and a living wage.\u201d She echoed his vision to fundamentally transform the country and called for an America that is \u201cmultigeographic\u201d and \u201cmultigendered.\u201d\n\n\u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) also offered her endorsement of Sanders, calling him the \u201conly candidate who has built a movement.\u201d\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has not formally issued an endorsement, but Sanders is expected to join the congresswoman for a tour of her district later this month.\n\nThe endorsements from key members of the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d sparked questions about their devotion to feminism and diversity. There is no shortage of women in the crowded Democrat field \u2013 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and Marianne Williamson (D) \u2013 yet they chose the oldest male candidate in the race.\n\nTheir decision sparked backlash and inspired a Vice article, which defended their decision from the critiques of \u201cwhite feminists.\u201d It is titled \u201cDon\u2019t Tell AOC, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib Their Bernie Endorsement Isn\u2019t Feminist.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s safe to assume \u2018The Squad\u2019 doesn\u2019t need white feminists to help them understand which candidate best supports their feminist principles,\u201d it reads in part.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said her decision to back Sanders over Warren had nothing to do with gender. Rather, she looked at the \u201cfeminist values in the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, this is not about \u2018Why not any other candidate?'\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, according to NPR. \u201cThe fact that [Sanders] has been fighting for these issues for so long struck me in a very personal way.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s so important about what Senator Sanders is talking about, and what this campaign is about, is that it\u2019s far larger than a presidential campaign,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told NPR, echoing Omar\u2019s remarks. \u201cThis is about creating a mass movement.\u201d\n\nWarren did not make a big deal out of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of her opponent, praising the freshman lawmaker for doing \u201cterrific work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a fan of the congresswoman. She\u2019s done some terrific work. We have worked together, and I know that once this primary is over we\u2019re all going to be on the same side,\u201d Warren said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez echoed that sentiment during an interview with CBS This Morning alongside Sanders.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s [Warren] a fabulous candidate and so frankly, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and myself are all on the same team in the party,\u201d she said:", "description": "Rep.
