Investors have big expectations for this meeting because of widespread deterioration in the Eurozone economy and talk of recession in Germany. Euro hit a 2-year low last week against the US dollar as German bund yields tumble deeper into negative territory. Back in July Draghi brought up the benefits of a combination of measures and since then the need for stimulus intensified. While investors are preparing for a massive dose of stimulus, there\u2019s also a reasonable chance the ECB will under deliver.\n\nThe Eurozone economy needs help. The table below compares changes since the ECB last met when nearly every part of the Eurozone economy weakened during the intervening 2 months. , , and activity slowed across the region and in Germany, growth contracted in the . The region\u2019s largest economy is crippled by weak global growth and a collapse in manufacturing. Not only did the PMI manufacturing index fall for the eighth month in a row but it reached its weakest level in 7 years.

They prefer a combination of measures because they feel that a package is \u201cmore effective than a sequence of selective actions.\u201d The market expects a minimum of a 10bp rate cut. If the central bank combines this with rate tiering or a new Quantitative Easing program, will sell off aggressively but if all they do is cut rates and strengthen their low-rate pledge, euro will soar in disappointment.\n\nWith the so weak, less aggressive measures could trigger a sharp short squeeze in the currency. Unfortunately, there\u2019s resistance to a package that includes QE \u2013 one of the strongest forms of easing. Bank of France Governor Villeroy is skeptical of the immediate need for QE while German and Dutch policy makers also believe it's too early for the move. Given the market\u2019s lofty expectations, EUR/USD traders could be setting themselves up for disappointment. Draghi could also opt for a stimulus package that does not include the most aggressive measures to leave his successor Christine Lagarde with ammo to fight a deeper slowdown.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: EUR/USD.
