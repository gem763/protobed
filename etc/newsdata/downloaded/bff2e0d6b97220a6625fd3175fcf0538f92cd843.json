They finally convinced her to impeach the president,\" McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video. \"All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.\n\n\"But I need your help,\" he adds, standing in front of a picture of an elephant. \"Please contribute before the deadline.\"\n\nThe McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's \"Ad Library,\" started running the digital ad last week, a few days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry over whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine's president to investigate political rival and possible 2020 opponent Joe Biden.\n\nPelosi: Trump impeachment probe 'a very sad time for our country'\n\nPhotos: The Trump impeachment inquiry in pictures\n\nThe ad features the same video, but McConnell's team has paired the video with different captions that all are mostly focused on the topic of impeachment.\n\n\"Your conservative Senate Majority is the ONLY thing stopping Nancy Pelosi from impeaching President Trump. Donate & help us keep it!\" one caption reads.\n\nMcConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden told The Courier Journal the impeachment inquiry is energizing the Senate leader's supporters.\n\n\"Few issues energize conservative voters like liberal overreach,\" Golden said in a statement. \"And the Democrats latest outrageous attempt to impeach President Trump has activated our base to new heights.\"\n\nAnother caption from Team Mitch goes after Pelosi's fellow California Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"BREAKING: Adam Schiff LIED. His office secretly coordinated with the source of this laughable impeachment inquiry,\" the caption reads. \"Help me stop it.\"\n\nThat caption appears to reference the New York Times reporting this week that Schiff received an early account of the whistleblower's complaint regarding Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nImpeachment inquiry: House Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents\n\nMore: Trump tears into Mitt Romney who said requests for Ukraine, China to investigate Biden were 'appalling'\n\nThe complaint from the anonymous whistleblower, reportedly a CIA officer, led to the White House releasing a summary of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nAccording to the call's summary, Trump told Zelensky to reopen an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company connected to Biden's son, Hunter.\n\nMcConnell reportedly told the White House to release the transcript of the phone call, something that McConnell and his spokespeople have not commented on.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump added further fuel to the fire by telling reporters that China should also investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe president also claimed Thursday that McConnell put out a statement referring to the president's phone call with the president of Ukraine as \"the most innocent phone call (transcript) that I\u2019ve read.\"\n\nMcConnell's office has not responded to questions about Trump's assertion, though the Senate leader dismissed criticism of the call last week and said it is \u201claughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nOn the Senate floor, McConnell has defended his record of standing up for Ukraine, especially against the Russian government.\n\nDemocrats and some Republican critics of Trump have said the president's requests to Ukraine and China are a blatant attempt to have a foreign power interfere with next year's election.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIt would take a simple majority of the House (218 votes) to submit articles of impeachment to the Senate.\n\nA trial would then be held in the Senate, where it would take at least two-thirds (or 67 votes) of the chamber to convict Trump and remove him from office.", "description": "Standing in front of a picture of an elephant, the Kentucky Republican said impeachment efforts will stop in the Senate with him as majority leader.", "authors": ["Billy Kobin", "Louisville Courier Journal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LtDh.XYNy0T5hh4HV3_ofQ--~B/aD0zMjEyO3c9NDgxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/8074b429699f03e889a394273b30aedb", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
