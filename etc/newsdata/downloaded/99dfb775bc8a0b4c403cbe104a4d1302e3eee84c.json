In addition to prison time, the former \"Desperate Housewives\" star was ordered to pay a fine of $20,000.\n\n\"Ms. Huffman is prepared to serve the term of imprisonment Judge Talwani ordered as one part of the punishment she imposed for Ms. Huffman\u2019s actions,\" her representative said in a statement. \"She will begin serving the remainder of the sentence Judge Talwani imposed -- one year of supervised release, with conditions including 250 hours of community service -- when she is released.\"\n\n(MORE: Felicity Huffman reports to prison to serve 14-day sentence in 'Varsity Blues' college entrance scam)\n\nAt FCI Dublin, breakfast is served from 5:30 a.m. to 6:15 a.m., lunch from 10:45 a.m. to noon, and dinner after 4 p.m. Breakfast meals could include milk, fruit, hot or cold cereal or bread with jelly.

According to the handbook, blouses, which are to be tucked in, must be buttoned, minus the top button at all times. Although gray t-shirts, white t-shirts and shorts cannot be worn as part of the uniform, they're acceptable at other times, but green clothing is not allowed inside the FCI.\n\nPHOTO: In this Sep. 13, 2019 file photo Felicity Huffman right, and her husband, William H.

These items are to be neatly stored in the identified storage space provided.\"\n\nHuffman must wear boots while in uniform, but she may also possess one pair of shower shoes, sneakers (valued at $100 or less), slippers and casual shoes.
