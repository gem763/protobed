Gelb, who observed and influenced U.S. foreign policy for decades, as a government official, journalist and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, where he sought to bring common sense to international power struggles, died Aug. 31 at a hospital in New York City. He was 82.\n\nThe cause of death was renal failure brought on by diabetes, said his daughter Caroline Gelb.\n\nDr. Gelb, who was mentored by Henry Kissinger at Harvard, had a wide-ranging expertise in global policy, beginning with an early assignment in the 1960s at the Defense Department, where he edited the Pentagon Papers, a history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam that was later leaked to the press.\n\nHe was given the assignment by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara in 1967, when the Vietnam War was at its height. Dr. Gelb was given a staff of six and three months to complete the job.\n\nIt took 36 people 18 months to complete the project, which resulted in a series of monographs and documents totaling 47 volumes. By the time it was finished in 1969, McNamara was no longer defense secretary. Dr. Gelb was waved away when he brought the finished volumes to McNamara.\n\nThe Pentagon Papers detailed \u2014 often in forthright terms \u2014 a haphazard history, fraught with chaos and ineptitude, of U.S. military and diplomatic efforts in Vietnam.\n\n\n\nLeslie H.

(Manny Ceneta/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cPart of the tragedy of Vietnam,\u201d Dr. Gelb wrote in his summary of the report, \u201cwas that the compromises our Presidents were prepared to offer could never lead to an end to the war.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he wrote, before troops were sent to Vietnam, \u201cno systematic or serious examination of Vietnam\u2019s importance to the United States was ever undertaken within the government.\u201d\n\nWhen parts of the Pentagon Papers were leaked to newspapers in 1971 by Daniel Ellsberg, one of the contributors hired by Dr. Gelb, opposition to the Vietnam War intensified.\n\nLater in his career, Dr. Gelb worked at think tanks, the New York Times and the State Department, where he was a chief negotiator in arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union in the late 1970s. At the Times, he shared a Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for a series of articles about the implications of the Strategic Defense Initiative \u2014 dubbed \u201cStar Wars\u201d \u2014 proposed during the administration of President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cPublicly, American allies are supporting research,\u201d Dr. Gelb wrote. \u201cPrivately, they continue to express the deepest fears that the program will bring a space arms race that will reduce or eliminate the links between American security and their own.\u201d\n\nHe later became a foreign affairs columnist and the editor of the Times\u2019s op-ed page. He left the paper in 1993 to become president of the Council on Foreign Relations, a high-powered think tank that has offered advice to presidents, military leaders and diplomats since the 1920s. Its influence has been so powerful, yet undefined, that it is often cited by conspiracy theorists as part of a cabal to institute some sort of global government.\n\nAs president of the council, which publishes the journal Foreign Affairs, Dr. Gelb sought to address the growing threat of violence from loosely organized terrorist groups.\n\n\u201cThese conflicts have become the scourge of the post-Cold War world,\u201d he told CNN in 2001. \u201cWithout empires to suppress these traditional hatreds, the haters in Africa or the Balkans or elsewhere began once again to kill their neighbors.\u201d\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Dr. Gelb hoped to gain influence with the White House of George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cPatriotism for a think tank,\u201d he told The Washington Post that year, \u201cis asking hard questions that are unlikely to be asked by political leaders or by journalists. That\u2019s our job. And for us, it\u2019s the highest form of patriotism.\u201d\n\nThen-Vice President Richard B. Cheney was on the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 board of directors, but the Bush administration moved in a hawkish direction, with the invasion of Iraq in 2003 \u2014 \u201cone of the most radical breaks in foreign policy in our history,\u201d Dr. Gelb said.\n\nWhen some Bush officials predicted a quick end to hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, followed by a move toward democratic institutions in those countries, Dr. Gelb was skeptical.\n\n\u201cElections and people on the street do not democracy make,\u201d he told the American Prospect in 2005. \u201cDemocracy really is a series of institutions and attitudes; it\u2019s free press, protection of minority rights, division of power. It\u2019s the confidence that if you lose in elections, you\u2019re not going to lose your basic interests and values or your life. It\u2019s the rule of law. And those things take a long, long time to develop.\u201d\n\nLeslie Howard Gelb was born March 4, 1937 in New Rochelle, N.Y. His parents, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, ran a corner grocery store.\n\nHe graduated in 1959 from Tufts University in Medford, Mass., working his way through college as a parking attendant and dishwasher. He joked that he studied political science and international relations because \u201cbeing a politics major, a government major, was easier than doing anything else.\u201d\n\nAt Harvard, where he studied with Kissinger, he received a master\u2019s degree in 1961 and doctorate in 1964, both in government.\n\nHe taught at Wesleyan University in Connecticut for a year and worked for Sen. Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) before moving to the Defense Department, where he was director of the policy planning staff.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dr. Gelb worked at the Brookings Institution, taught at Georgetown University and was a diplomatic correspondent for the Times. He served in the State Department during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, helping negotiate a strategic arms limitation treaty with the Soviet Union.\n\nDr. Gelb worked at the Times from 1981 to 1993 and published several books on foreign policy. In his 2009 book, \u201cPower Rules: How Common Sense Can Rescue American Foreign Policy,\u201d he called for a pragmatic approach to international relations but warned that the United States was \u201cat the point of declining as a nation and a world power.\u201d\n\nTo retain its influence abroad, he wrote, the United States would first have to improve its infrastructure, health care and education at home.\n\nDr. Gelb retired from the Council on Foreign Relations in 2003 but maintained a connection with the organization for many years.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 60 years, the former Judith Cohen of New York; three children, Adam Gelb of Atlanta, Caroline Gelb of Brooklyn and Alison Gelb Andrus of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; and five grandsons.\n\nDr. Gelb had a knack for summarizing complex ideas in a few pithy words, making foreign policy digestible at the dinner table.\n\n\u201cFail alone, succeed together,\u201d he said in a 2009 interview with the Institute of International Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cThat\u2019s the moral of this power story, and that\u2019s what we have to understand.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat are public intellectuals supposed to do? We\u2019re not supposed to be cheerleaders. We\u2019re supposed to be prodding those with power to think through what they\u2019re doing that will affect us all.\u201d", "description": "He edited the Pentagon Papers, worked at the New York Times and led the Council on Foreign Relations.", "authors": ["Matt Schudel", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mjXBK0ua23_U0eduUCTqzcZAvGE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5JCPCBWMBAI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg"}
