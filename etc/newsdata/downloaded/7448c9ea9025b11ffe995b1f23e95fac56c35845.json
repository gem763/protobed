They seize slowly into focus, and you start to see a Doppler map of finely parsed grays. At farthest stage right, there\u2019s the back door of a house and a tiny patio. Off to the left, past a dead campfire and some chairs, is the true dark of the woods. By the door, it\u2019s just light enough to see the figure of a man sitting improbably still, holding a rifle. In the moments before he shoots the gun\u2014a real one (with blanks), startling and resonant in the small Playwrights Horizons theatre\u2014the onstage scene looks like a rural Hopper. The silence around the man almost speaks, and its intimations of impending loss are awful. After the shot, the man guts his victim\u2014a deer\u2014but noticeably lacks any hint of sporting exuberance. His hand shakes, and he needs to steady himself. Afterward, he\u2019s mostly worried about the blood on the ground. The shooter\u2019s name is Justin (Jeb Kreager), and, in the next scene, he\u2019s hosting a fraught party that\u2019s beginning to wind down. A group of young acquaintances\u2014not quite friends in every case, but they share a kind of compulsory intimacy\u2014have converged on the town in western Wyoming where they attended a small conservative Catholic college known for the rigors of its classical education. They trade lines from Gerard Manley Hopkins\u2019s great poem \u201cGod\u2019s Grandeur,\u201d drop adoring references to \u201cmy gal Flannery O,\u201d and ask one another questions like \u201cHow\u2019s your soul?\u201d As the party rambles on and the guests flit in and out of the house, a warm, yellow stream of light comes from the door, heightening the drama of shadow and light. Everybody\u2019s face is half lit. (Isabella Byrd offers a masterpiece of lighting design, rich with portent and glinting significance.) People step out of shadows, having heard things not meant for their ears. Hopper becomes Caravaggio, and \u201cHeroes,\u201d a formally lovely, subtly horrifying play about the death rattle of ideologies and the thin line between devotion and delusion, echoes the interplay between those two painters of profound psychological depth. Each of the characters is in some ways terribly alone, like Hopper\u2019s city zombies, vacant about the eyes, but each one\u2019s heart, poked into flame by conversation, is, like the doubting disciple in Caravaggio\u2019s \u201cThe Incredulity of Saint Thomas,\u201d reaching out for something solid to match the intensity of his or her hopes and ideas. They\u2019re all conservatives, bewildered by a world that no longer takes its shape from the political and metaphysical assumptions they share. Young though they are, the spirit of the age is passing them by. Much of the thrill of the play comes in hearing ultraconservative ideas\u2014scarce on New York stages\u2014discussed in earnest, and carried to their most ominous conclusions. The timing of the party, set in the very recent and miserably memorable past, lends even more symbolic weight: it\u2019s just a week after the white-supremacist riot and murder in Charlottesville, Virginia. Steve Bannon\u2019s just been fired from the White House.\n\nLike Justin, Emily (Julia McDermott) still lives in Wyoming. She\u2019s sick with a disease that\u2019s never named but which leaves her body in constant pain and her mind, as we see it inexorably revealed, open to a raw and sometimes unwelcome empathy with the world beyond this circle of friends. Her mother, Gina (Michele Pawk), is the college\u2019s newly inaugurated president, and the person in whose honor the group has ostensibly gathered. Kevin (John Zdrojeski) works for a publisher of Catholic textbooks whose bland accounts of the lives of the saints have become his bane. He\u2019s too drunk, close to a breakdown, and revelling in the self-hatred and the religious anguish that have become his entire personality. Incommensurably, he wants both a girlfriend and a priest\u2019s collar. Teresa (Zo\u00eb Winters) lives in Brooklyn among the heathens, a Bannonite rose grown from concrete. (\u201cHe\u2019ll be back,\u201d she says of her fired hero. And, who knows, she might be right.) Her sentences are harsh, fascistic bullets, and she advocates a Schmittian war against abortionists and other apostates. Unlike the softhearted, ecumenical Emily, she sees Trump as a life raft; to her, he\u2019s a \u201cGolem molded from the clay of mass media, and he\u2019s come to save us all.\u201d Winters plays Teresa with unnerving precision, carefully walking the line between naturalism\u2014some of us are truly both this anxious and obnoxiously confident\u2014and a kind of stentorian, hysterical Fox News presentation. Justin is gentle but equally afraid of the outer world. He wants to withdraw into a localism that sounds uncomfortably like doomsday prepperdom. He cites the \u201cBenedict Option\u201d\u2014a strategic Christian retreat promoted by the writer Rod Dreher\u2014and gives a short speech that cools the blood: \u201cThere are more of them.\u201d More of the godless and progressive, he means. \u201cWe lost the popular vote, by a lot. . . . And they\u2019re mobilizing. In many ways, they are in power. And they\u2019re trying to wipe us out.\u201d There\u2019s just enough ideological and attitudinal space between these characters to make for revealing arguments in each direction\u2014for example: Can one be pro-choice and, in any meaningful way, also be a good person?\u2014and to reveal the despair lurking behind their rhetorical and emotional poses. To catch the nuances in their differences\u2014and to imagine what these nuances might mean for the future of people like these, and therefore for the future of our country\u2014is a bit like the corneal adjustment required in the first moment of the play: you\u2019ve got to distinguish dark from dark, and perceive a thousand darknesses in between.", "description": "A group of friends grapple with ideologies in Will Arbery\u2019s \u201cHeroes of the Fourth Turning,\u201d at Playwrights Horizons, Vinson Cunningham writes.", "authors": ["Vinson Cunningham", "Colton Wooten", "Charles Duhigg", "Carly Simon", "John Cassidy", "Andy Borowitz", "Alexandra Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d9f7a87924a2b0008dfc871/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/191021_r35176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
