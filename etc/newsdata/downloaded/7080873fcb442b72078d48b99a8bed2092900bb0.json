The striking 22-year-old redhead has more than 100 catwalk shows under her belt, along with ads for brands like Diesel.\n\nAt London and New York Fashion Weeks this season she walked for 18 designers including Tommy Hilfiger, at one point handing out high-fives to her admirers in the front row.\n\nHer 307,000 followers on Instagram devour updates about her glamorous lifestyle and strict exercise regime, with her most popular post viewed more than 338,000 times.\n\nMadeline Stuart, 22, (pictured) who boasts 307,000 followers on Instagram, is the world's first professional catwalk model with Down's syndrome\n\nMadeline also has Down\u2019s syndrome. \u2018When Madeline was born there were no positive images in the media of women with Down\u2019s syndrome,\u2019 says her mother Rosanne when we meet backstage at London Fashion Week. \u2018The only photos you ever saw were of overweight people with their tongue hanging out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made sure Madeline looks her best. I wanted to show people with Down\u2019s syndrome can be beautiful and successful.\u2019\n\nRosanne is every inch the confident matriarch and \u2018momager\u2019. When one of Madeline\u2019s fans asks Rosanne for a photo, she retorts, \u2018You can ask her yourself; she\u2019s 22!\u2019\n\nMadeline is charming and sweet, greeting me each time we meet like an old friend, with spontaneous hugs. She speaks mostly in single words because of a speech impediment but has a force of personality to match her mum\u2019s.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s very high-functioning socially,\u2019 Rosanne says. \u2018The problem is because of poor muscle tone, she can\u2019t form words correctly. There\u2019s also a stubbornness \u2014 it\u2019s such hard work for her to talk so she refuses to do it.\u2019\n\nThis hasn\u2019t held Madeline back from some quite extraordinary achievements. She has become the first model with Down\u2019s syndrome to conquer the mainstream catwalk, racking up four years of Fashion Week shows in several countries. Of the three other successful adult models with Down\u2019s syndrome \u2014 Kathleen Humberstone, from Surrey, who appeared in a River Island campaign; Marian Avila, from Spain; and Kate Grant, from Ireland \u2014 so far Madeline is the only one to regularly walk for designers during Fashion Week.\n\nMadeline's mother Rosanne (pictured with Madeline as a baby), was 25-years-old and living in Brisbane, Australia when she gave birth\n\nShe\u2019s appeared in Vogue and named the \u2018No 1 game-changer in the fashion industry\u2019 by Forbes magazine. Yet some ask whether it\u2019s Madeline who loves the limelight, or whether Rosanne has pushed her daughter on to the world stage.\n\n\u2018People say I\u2019m a pushy mum all the time,\u2019 Rosanne admits easily. \u2018I laugh! I say, \u201cWell, come and spend a couple of hours with us and then you\u2019ll see who\u2019s boss. It\u2019s not me!\u201d \u2019\n\nI first met Madeline a year ago after a press officer introduced me to her mother. I asked for a photo but, exhausted from a day of shows, Madeline refused with a clear \u2018No\u2019.\n\nI backed down but Rosanne told her to do it. Suddenly, boom! \u2018Madeline the model\u2019 sprang to life, flashing a practised smile. When I posted the picture on Twitter, it received more than half a million views.\n\n\u2018I think because Madeline has an intellectual disability people don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable of making her own decisions,\u2019 Rosanne tells me when we meet again a year later.\n\n\u2018I am pushy to a certain extent. For instance, if Madeline says she wants chips, I say, \u201cWell, do you want chips or do you want to model?\u201d and she\u2019ll have a bowl of fruit instead. I\u2019m not going to let her think, \u201cOK, I\u2019ve got a disability so I should get a free pass.\u201d She needs to work hard for her success.\u2019\n\nRosanne was warned by a doctor that Madeline (pictured) would never mature mentally past seven years old and that she would never achieve anything\n\nA desire for Madeline to prove everyone wrong is clearly a cornerstone of Rosanne\u2019s character. She was 25 when she had Madeline, her first and much wanted child, in Brisbane, Australia. She had no idea her baby had Down\u2019s syndrome until the day she was born, and the stress ended her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 \u2014 Madeline\u2019s father. He has played no part in Madeline\u2019s upbringing.\n\nA doctor warned Rosanne her baby \u2018would never mature mentally past seven years old\u2019 and \u2018never achieve anything\u2019.\n\nHe said Madeline\u2019s presence would be detrimental to any future children, adding, \u2018You have options . . .\u2019, by which, Rosanne says, he meant putting her up for adoption. A counsellor was even sent to her hospital room to persuade her to give up her baby.\n\n\u2018I was horrified. I didn\u2019t consider it for a second,\u2019 she says. \u2018Over the next few days, I repeated the same thing ten times to anyone who tried to convince me: \u201cThis is my baby. I\u2019m keeping her and I\u2019m going to love her.\u201d \u2019\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. Madeline needed open-heart surgery at two months old and had countless medical appointments in her first year.\n\nRosanne started working part-time for the local government, sometimes taking Madeline with her. A year later she set up the successful surveying business she still runs today.\n\nMadeline (pictured) began an intensive exercise and healthy eating regime, aged 18, after she began struggling with her favourite hobbies\n\nSo determined was she that Madeline\u2019s condition would never hold her back, it took her years to accept doctors\u2019 verdicts on her physical limitations. She says: \u2018The doctors told me Madeline\u2019s speech would never progress beyond a certain point but I always assumed one day she\u2019d wake up and talk fluently to me.\n\n\u2018Then, one day when Madeline was seven, the truth hit me. Out of the blue as I drove to work, I realised my daughter was never going to be able to chat to me and would probably never read or write. I started crying in the car and couldn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t go to work that day.\u2019\n\nMadeline attended mainstream primary education, then a secondary school suited to her needs.\n\nWherever she went, her mum says she was part of the \u2018cool gang\u2019. \u2018Everyone loved her because she never had a mean word to say,\u2019 says Rosanne.\n\nBut, in 2015, aged 18 and in her last year of school, she was struggling in her favourite hobbies of sport and dance \u2014 those with Down\u2019s syndrome often have a slower metabolism and gain weight easily.\n\nTogether, Rosanne insists, they decided Madeline would start an intensive exercise and healthy eating regime. As Madeline slogged it out in the pool and did basketball, gymnastics, cricket and gym sessions, the puppy fat fell away. She lost 23kg (three and a half stone). Rosanne shared before and after photos on a public Facebook account.\n\nRosanne says Madeline (pictured) voiced her desire to become a model, after attending a fashion show in Brisbane\n\nThe images sparked an astonishing response. Overnight, Madeline\u2019s Facebook following grew to 100,000 and within days the photos were viewed 6.8 million times. The majority of responses were positive but others questioned Madeline\u2019s \u2014 and Rosanne\u2019s \u2014 motivation.\n\n\u2018She did not lose weight to become a model. She became a model when she lost weight,\u2019 says Rosanne firmly.\n\nSoon after, Rosanne took her daughter to a fashion show in Brisbane. Madeline took one look and said, \u2018Mum, me model\u2019. It was good timing.\n\nWith growing calls for diversity in the fashion world, more brands were (and still are) experimenting with using models who don\u2019t fit the traditional mould. Specialist agencies represent models with disabilities but Rosanne was determined her daughter would be a \u2018mainstream\u2019 model \u2014 and be paid in full, contrary to some employers\u2019 assumptions.\n\nNow, Madeline is financially independent. They have opened a dance school in Brisbane for those with disabilities, and launched a clothing line.\n\nMadeline has a boyfriend of five years, Robbie, whom she met through the Special Olympics (a sports organisation for those with disabilities). He has an intellectual impairment but works at a supermarket.\n\nWhat next? Rosanne says: \u2018Madeline owns a house in Brisbane of her own and when she wants to live independently I will fully support that.\u2019\n\nAs for Rosanne herself, \u2018I\u2019m exhausted!\u2019 she laughs. \u2018I would give all this up tomorrow if Madeline wanted to.\u2019\n\nMadeline, however, has no plans to quit. \u2018Every day she asks me when we\u2019re going back to New York, when her next modelling job is. She loves it.\u2019\n\nfacebook.com/ madelinesmodelling, @madelinesmodelling_", "description": "Madeline Stuart, 22, has appeared on over 100 catwalks.
