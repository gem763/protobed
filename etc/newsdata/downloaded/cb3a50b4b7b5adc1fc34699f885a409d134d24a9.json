The gap between the two has been widening thanks largely to the book channel. Graphic-novel sales through the channel was at nearly $500 million last year, but at less than $200 million through comic shops.\n\n: Graphic novel print sales reached $635 million in 2018 and single-issue (or periodical) print sales were at $360 million. The gap between the two has been widening thanks largely to the book channel. Graphic-novel sales through the channel was at nearly $500 million last year, but at less than $200 million through comic shops. New types of content are becoming more popular: Children's comics, which are almost exclusively sold in the graphic-novel format, have surpassed superhero comics this year as the most popular genre, according to ICv2. \"Superheroes have dominated the comics business for as long as I've been in it, but there are some amazing things happening with kids content,\" Griepp said at last week's conference.\n\nThe chart below shows how graphic-novel sales have been increasing through the book channel but plateaued at comic shops.\n\nGraphic novels have risen in popularity through the book channel. Provided by ICv2. Reprinted with permission.\n\nSo why aren't people buying children's content and graphic novels at comic shops?\n\nThe comic industry has operated since the early 1970s on a \"direct market\" model, in which a distributor (the main one being Diamond Comic Distributors) sells comics to comic shops on a non-returnable basis. It makes pre-orders essential to the business.\n\nPeriodical comics and children's graphic novels are distributed through a vastly different business model and comic shops struggle to balance the two.\n\n\"Comic shops have been slow to expand into kids graphic novels,\" Griepp told Business Insider. \"Comic stores and the distribution system are focused on periodical releases but are less skilled on the book side.\"\n\nMore comic stores are experimenting, though, and buying from the book channel through publishers like Penguin Random House and Simon and Schuster, according to Griepp. But a big problem is that parents don't shop at comic stores. They're already in book stores and online and comic shops have been slow to catch up.\n\nFurthermore, tastes have just generally been shifting away from the periodical comic format that comic shops specialize in to graphic novels, where readers get a complete story, according to Griepp. He called it \"binge consumption.\"\n\nThe streaming era is impacting the comic industry, too\n\nDavid Steinberger, the CEO of Amazon's digital comics service Comixology, said at last week's conference that consumers are moving toward the binge model generally because it's \"inexpensive, convenient, and there's a lot of content.\"\n\n\"I think that's kind of where we're headed [with comics],\" he said.\n\nBut Steinberger isn't ruling out periodicals just yet, he said. And he contended Comixology could attract new readers. Since Amazon acquired the service in 2014, Comixology has launched an Unlimited subscription program and Comixology Originals, which are exclusive to the service.\n\nSteinberger said he thinks growth in the digital-comic space will help retailers in the print business.\n\n\"Retailers were very frightened of us at first,\" Steinberger said at the conference. \"But many of them now say, 'I had someone come in and buy the first 10 volumes of \"The Walking Dead\" after first trying it on digital.' So they have started to calm down and relax about that. I don't think we've destroyed anything. What we have done is give more opportunities for both established players and new players to come in and reach audiences.\"\n\nThe future of comic shops\n\nSince children's comics are growing in popularity, Griepp is hopeful that a new generation of fans will emerge that could potentially move into comic shops and read more superhero comics. At 5 million copies for its most recent volume, Dav Pilkey's \"Dog Man\" is the most-circulated graphic novel ever, according to Griepp.\n\n\"There's a whole cohort of young readers that are being introduced to this medium and may graduate to other forms of content in the comic format over the course of their lifespans,\" he said at the conference.\n\nBut he firmly believes that \"content is king.\"\n\n\"In the past, lags have always been content driven,\" he told Business Insider. \"Superheroes are soft right now, but all it takes is one hit to turn that around. All it takes is one title to catch on and we'll be talking about comic stores growing again.\"\n\nBut the types of content and platforms might not be enough. Gerry Conway, the creator of such comic characters as The Punisher, told Business Insider earlier this year that the comic industry's business model is \"totally unsustainable.\"\n\n\"There's going to have to be something that happens that's comparable to what happened in the '70s with the direct-sale market,\" Conway said. \"That resulted in a redefinition of the distribution methodology and the market that you're aiming the books at. Both of those changes came hand-in-hand and resulted in a dramatic difference.\"", "description": "Book stores and online retailers are surpassing comic shops in sales as graphic novels and children's books rise in popularity.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da09eeb4af9093e73015743?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
