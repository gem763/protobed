In the West, wildfires contributed to the rise in particulate matter.\n\n+30 % difference from 2016 levels +30 West Midwest +20 +20 +11.5% +9.3% +10 +10 Fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) 0 0 \u00ad\u20135 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % difference from 2016 levels +30 % Northeast South +20 +20 +10 +10 0 0 \u20130.8% \u20131.3% \u00ad\u20135 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % difference from 2016 levels +30 West Midwest +20 +20 +11.5% +9.3% +10 +10 Fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) 0 0 \u00ad\u20135 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % difference from 2016 levels +30 % Northeast South +20 +20 +10 +10 0 0 \u20130.8% \u20131.3% \u00ad\u20135 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % difference from 2016 levels +30 West Midwest +20 +20 +11.5% +9.3% +10 +10 Fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) 0 0 \u00ad\u20135 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % difference from 2016 levels +30 % Northeast South +20 +20 +10 +10 0 0 \u20130.8% \u20131.3% \u00ad\u20135 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % difference from 2016 levels West +20 +11.5% +10 Fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) 0 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 Midwest +20 +9.3% +10 0 \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % difference from 2016 levels Northeast +20 +10 0 \u20130.8% \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 +30 % South +20 +10 0 \u20131.3% \u00ad\u20135 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 Source: National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nResearchers also suggested that a decrease in enforcement of the Clean Air Act may have contributed to the recent rise in pollution. That law and its subsequent updates put in place strict air pollution standards for power plants, factories, vehicles and other sources, and has been credited with dramatically improving air quality across the country and saving hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nThe new analysis estimated that the increase of slightly more than 5 percent in fine particulate pollution nationwide between 2016 and 2018 was associated with nearly 10,000 additional premature deaths during that time.\n\nFine particulate pollution \u2013 known as PM2.5 because the particles are less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, or one-thirtieth the size of a human hair \u2013 has been linked to a range of health problems including asthma and respiratory inflammation, lung cancer, heart attack and stroke.
