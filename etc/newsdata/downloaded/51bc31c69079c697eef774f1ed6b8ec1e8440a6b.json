Rather, he was giving credit to himself and to his vice president and secretary of state, who negotiated a partial cease-fire a week after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey sent troops across the Syrian border to drive out Kurdish forces he considers a threat.\n\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s bizarre account, he claimed to have done Turkey and the Kurds a \u201cgreat service\u201d by creating a 20-mile-wide safe zone between them \u2014 \u201can interesting term, safe zone,\u201d the president mused, as if he had just come up with a radically new concept. (The zone was in fact negotiated by Turkey and the Russians.) The president said he was lifting sanctions on Turkish products, and gushed that the commander of Kurdish forces \u201ccould not have been more thankful.\u201d\n\nRelated Slideshow:: Tensions in Syria (Provided by Photo Services)\n\nLess than 24 hours later, that same Kurdish commander, Mazloum Abdi, was complaining on Twitter that Turkish forces were violating the \u201cpermanent\u201d cease-fire brokered by Mr. Trump.\n\nAs is often the case with Trump pronouncements, it is hard to know where to begin. In effect, Mr. Trump was blithely taking full credit for ending a brutal battle he had a hand in starting and claiming a significant feat when in fact the betrayal of the Kurds and the brusque, thoughtless American withdrawal undermined American credibility and was a major victory for Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Bashar al-Assad, the butcher of Syria.\n\nThere would have been no need to dispatch Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to get a cease-fire had Mr. Trump himself not suddenly pulled American troops away from the border after a phone chat with Mr. Erdogan, the Turkish president and one of the strongmen rulers who melt the president\u2019s heart. And Mr. Erdogan agreed to the cease-fire only after he effectively achieved everything he wanted, driving the Kurds far back from the Turkish border in a brief but murderous onslaught.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Turkey-backed Syrian rebel fighters gather near the border town of Tal Abyad, Syria October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi\n\nAnd only a day before Mr. Trump lifted sanctions on Turkey, Mr. Erdogan had spent several hours in Sochi, Russia, with a happy Mr. Putin \u2014 another of Mr. Trump\u2019s paragons of effective governance \u2014 getting his marching orders from the Russian leader. With the Americans now out of the way and the Kurds in flight, Turkey and Russia will now jointly patrol the border area.\n\nThat Mr. Putin and Mr. al-Assad were now undisputed masters of Syria seemed not to faze Mr. Trump. Nor did he appear concerned that Turkey, a NATO ally whose country harbors American nuclear weapons, and whose leader recently let on that he is thinking of getting nukes of his own, was looking to buy state-of-the-art weaponry from NATO\u2019s primary foe. \u201cOther countries have stepped forward. They want to help, and we think that\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Trump said, making clear that he meant not the European allies \u2014 who, as usual, got a passing whack from the back of the president\u2019s hand \u2014 but rather Russian forces, recently accused in a Times investigative report of systematically bombing Syrian hospitals.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images President Donald Trump departs after a Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony for auto racing great Roger Penske in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 24, 2019, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nPerhaps it should not come as a surprise anymore that Mr. Trump sees anything he does as a great and unprecedented achievement, or that he views the Middle East as little more than a patch of \u201cbloodstained sand\u201d that Americans should stay out of, or that he puts more stock in dictators than in allies.\n\nYet it still comes as a shock that a man, already facing an impeachment inquiry over his misuse of the presidency to pressure Ukraine into doing his political dirty work, would not pause to wonder whether there might be a better way to conduct the foreign policy of the world\u2019s most powerful \u2014 and once most respected \u2014 nation. In shaping his view on Ukraine, too, Mr. Trump apparently paid more heed to autocratic Ukraine-bashers like Mr. Putin and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary than to any of his own advisers.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images In this image grab from AFP footage, a convoy of Syrian regime troops arrives in the northern border town of Kobane (also known in Arabic as Ain Arab) late on October 24, 2019. - Turkey's October 9 assault on Kurdish areas in northeaster Syria was made possible by a pullback of US troops deployed along the border as a buffer force between their NATO ally Turkey and the Kurdish fighters of the Syrian Democratic Froces (SDF) earlier this month. The regime has since deployed in the border town of Kobane as well as the town of Manbij further south, without clashing with Turkish forces.

It\u2019s hard to believe they were not anxiously trying to guess what \u201cvery special\u201d fire they\u2019d next be sent to fight.\n\nMORE IN DEPTH:\n\nOpinion: Trump's lynching tweet is 'offensive and dangerous' (Slate)", "description": "In announcing a \u201cpermanent\u201d cease-fire along the Turkish-Syrian border on Wednesday, President Trump smugly declared that \u201cthis was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJkrTz.img?h=209&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1336&y=833", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
