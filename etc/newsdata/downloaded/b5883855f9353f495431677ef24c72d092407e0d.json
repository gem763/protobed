As free schools become an increasingly important part of England\u2019s educational landscape, it will be by working together with other schools and the wider education sector that we will be able to reach those neglected communities with historically low attainment to help transform lives,\u201d she added.\n\nSchools minister Lord Agnew said: \u201cOver the last decade free schools across the country have enabled trailblazing school leaders, who know what works best for young people, to inject fresh approaches and draw in talent and expertise from different groups and backgrounds.\n\n\u201cAs the EPI has recognised in its report, this is yielding great results \u2013 in 2018, free schools were among the highest performing state schools in the country.\n\n\u201cThey often offer school places to disadvantaged communities, so that parents can send their children to a good local school.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not complacent. We\u2019re aware that there are low performing areas across the country that still need good school places and that\u2019s why we opened applications for more new free schools earlier this year, targeting areas with low educational standards.\u201d", "description": "The government\u2019s flagship free schools programme has failed to target the areas in England where education outcomes are poorest, according to a think tank.
