A video of school officials cutting Johnson\u2019s hair before the match went viral on social media and caused widespread outrage.\n\nA wrestler was forced to cut his dreadlocks before a match. His town is still looking for answers.\n\nThe New Jersey Division on Civil Rights also issued a new \u201cGuidance on Race Discrimination Based on Hairstyle\u201d to explain that treating people differently because of their hairstyle may violate the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws and to help prevent such discrimination in the future, according to Grewal.\n\n\u201cStudent athletes should be able to compete with each other on a level playing field,\u201d Grewal said in a statement. \u201cRacial discrimination in the enforcement of the rules of any sport is inconsistent with the spirit of fair play. The Division on Civil Rights\u2019 action today makes it less likely that any student athlete will have to endure discrimination that not only undermines fair competition but also violates our state laws.\u201d\n\nThe parallel investigations interviewed Johnson, Maloney, the NJSIAA rules interpreter and officials, members of the New Jersey Wrestling Officials Association, and the rules interpreter for the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), which develops and publishes the rules for high school wrestling across the country, among others.\n\nA video of the Dec. 19 incident showed an emotional Johnson, who is biracial, standing on the mat while a white female trainer cut off his dreadlocks shortly after Maloney, who is white, had given him the ultimatum.\n\nFollowing the incident, Buena made international headlines as countless politicians, celebrities, athletes and activists defended Johnson, from Chance the Rapper to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to the Rev. Al Sharpton.\n\nSome in the New Jersey wrestling community defended Maloney, who in 2016 was also accused of using a racial slur during an altercation with a black referee. In March, Maloney sent a notice of intent of filing a lawsuit, claiming defamation of character and emotional distress. He could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the Division on Civil Rights investigation, Maloney had argued that Johnson\u2019s hair violated the National Federation of State High School Associations\u2019 Rule 4.2.1, which governs the length of an athlete\u2019s hair and when an athlete must wear a hair cover.\n\n\u201cHowever, that rule had previously been interpreted by various New Jersey wrestling officials to require a hair covering for several traditionally Black hairstyles regardless of hair length,\u201d Grewal said in the statement.\n\nAs part of the agreement between the Division on Civil Rights and NJSIAA, the NJSIAA will provide training to all of its local rules interpreters and to all wrestling officials in the state emphasizing that Rule 4.2.1 is based solely on hair length, not on hair style.\n\nAccording to Wednesday\u2019s release, the training will be completed before the start of this year\u2019s wrestling season and \u201cwill also explain the long history of discrimination based on hair style.\u201d", "description": "The viral incident from last December, in which Alan Maloney gave Andrew Johnson the option of cutting his dreadlocks or forfeiting, caused widespread outrage.", "authors": ["Roman Stubbs", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VUIMEJG2KQI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
