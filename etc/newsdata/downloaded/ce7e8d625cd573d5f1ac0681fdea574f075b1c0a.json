(These chickens can lay more than 200 eggs a year.) But the team also genetically modified these egg-laying chickens to disable a gene called DDX4. Without this gene, the hens do not develop primordial germ cells.\n\nThe next step is to put the two pieces together, by replacing the missing cells with those from a rare breed. McGrew\u2019s team took the primordial germ cells extracted from the rare breeds and injected them into an egg containing a modified Hy-Line Brown embryo, which lacked primordial germ cells of its own. The chick hatched from this egg can become a surrogate mother. While it grows into a Hy-Line Brown layer chicken, its eggs in turn contain genetic material from the rare breed. When the eggs are fertilized with sperm\u2014frozen or fresh\u2014from a male of the same breed, the result is, finally, a new chick. (Semen from birds doesn\u2019t freeze as well as that from mammals either, but it can be done.)\n\nRead: A reckless and needless use of genetic editing on human embryos\n\nThe team ultimately got chicks this way from four rare British breeds: Cream Legbar, Marsh Daisy, Scots Dumpy, and Scots Grey. All were hatched from eggs laid by genetically modified Hy-Line Brown layer hens.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a goal for a long time. I\u2019m glad to see it done,\u201d says Jim Petitte, a professor of poultry science at North Carolina State University. The poultry industry has long sought a way to maintain and revive breeds from frozen cells, as a means of genetic backup. If a new illness strikes or farmers want to breed a new trait, they dip into the genetic catalog of heritage breeds.\n\nCurrently, however, the only way to maintain a genetic stock of birds is to continuously keep a flock of birds alive. This is expensive, which means it is precarious. Drew Benson, a professor of poultry science at the University of Georgia, says a turkey line he studied in his dissertation is no longer being maintained. It\u2019s essentially gone from the world. A frozen aviary would be much cheaper to maintain. \u201cAll you need essentially is a nitrogen storage tank, and you don\u2019t have the recurring expense of feedstock,\u201d he says.\n\nMcGrew\u2019s work is partially funded by agriculture grants in the U.K., but he\u2019s also interested in how this technique could be applied to endangered birds. In 2013, he gave a TEDx talk about the possibility of reviving extinct passenger pigeons. Elsewhere in the world, the San Diego Zoo, which famously maintains a \u201cfrozen zoo,\u201d has also investigated the use of germ cells for preserving exotic birds. The big, unanswered question, McGrew says, is whether female birds of not just different breeds but different species can act as surrogates.", "description": "A new way to revive rare breeds\u2014and perhaps even endangered birds\u2014from frozen cells", "authors": ["Sarah Zhang"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Three_Chicks_Woodcock_PNAS/facebook.jpg?1571747023", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
