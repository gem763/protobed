Their law is named after pacifist Dr George Logan who entered into unauthorised negotiations with France in 1798 in a bid to avert conflict with the United States.\n\nOnly two people have ever been indicted on charges of violating the US Act, both in the 19th Century, and neither were convicted. The maximum penalty for breaking the new law would replicate US law at three years' imprisonment.\n\nLast night, James Rogers, director of the Global Britain Programme at the Henry Jackson Society, said: 'In the past, Britain has not needed an American-style Logan Act as well-observed convention left diplomacy to authorised government ministers.\n\n'The recent rise of 'shadow negotiators', both with the EU and with foreign governments beyond, has destroyed that convention and risks undermining the national interest.\n\n'Therefore, very serious consideration is likely to be given to new laws to deter unauthorised diplomatic activity with foreign actors with whom the government is in negotiation and disagreement.'", "description": "The backbench push comes in the wake of angry claims by Boris Johnson's No 10 officials that anti-Brexit members of Parliament had worked with EU countries to wreck the UK's exit negotiations.", "authors": ["Harry Cole Deputy Political Editor For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/20/19935050-0-image-a-24_1571513968172.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
