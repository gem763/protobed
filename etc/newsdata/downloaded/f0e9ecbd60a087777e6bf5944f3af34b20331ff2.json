The site\u2019s search bar is the most common way for U.S. shoppers to find items online, and most purchases stem from the first page of search results, according to marketing analytics firm Jumpshot.\n\nTop Billing When people search for products on Amazon*, nearly two-thirds of all product clicks come from the first page of results\u2026 Row 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 First page Other pages 0 20 40 60% \u2026so the proliferation of Amazon's private-label products on the first page makes it more likely people choose those items.

An algorithm skewed toward profitability could steer customers toward thousands of Amazon\u2019s in-house products that deliver higher profit margins than competing listings on the site.\n\nAmazon\u2019s lawyers rejected an initial proposal for how to add profit directly into the algorithm, saying it represented a change that could create trouble with antitrust regulators, one of the people familiar with the project said.\n\nThe Amazon search team\u2019s view was that the profitability push violated the company\u2019s principle of doing what is best for the customer, the people familiar with the project said. \u201cThis was definitely not a popular project,\u201d said one. \u201cThe search engine should look for relevant items, not for more profitable items.\u201d\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos has propounded a \u2018customer obsession\u2019 mantra. Photo: JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAmazon said it has for many years considered long-term profitability and does look at the impact of it when deploying an algorithm. \u201cWe have not changed the criteria we use to rank search results to include profitability,\u201d said Amazon spokeswoman Angie Newman in an emailed statement.\n\nAmazon declined to say why A9 engineers considered the profitability emphasis to be a significant change to the algorithm, and it declined to discuss the inner workings of its algorithm or the internal discussions involving the algorithm, including the qualms of the company\u2019s lawyers.\n\nThe change could also boost brand-name products or third-party listings on the site that might be more profitable than Amazon\u2019s products. And the algorithm still also stresses longstanding metrics such as unit sales. The people who worked on the project said they didn\u2019t know how much the change has helped Amazon\u2019s own brands.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Ms. Newman said: \u201cAmazon designs its shopping and discovery experience to feature the products customers will want, regardless of whether they are our own brands or products offered by our selling partners.\u201d\n\nAntitrust regulators for decades have focused on whether companies use market power to squeeze out competition. Amazon avoided scrutiny partly because its competitive marketplace of merchants drives down prices.\n\nProfit Center A majority of Amazon's sales come from retail, but a majority of its operating profits come from its cloud-computing unit. Retail, subscriptions, advertising and services Amazon Web Services Percentage of total sales 86.9% 13.1% Retail sales and commissions: 75% Percentage of operating income 42.1% 57.9%\n\nNow, some lawmakers are calling for Washington to rethink antitrust law to account for big technology companies\u2019 clout. In Amazon\u2019s case, they say it can bend its dominant platform to favor its own products. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has argued Amazon stifles small businesses by unfairly promoting its private-label products and underpricing competitors. Amazon has disputed this claim.\n\nDuring a House antitrust hearing in July, lawmakers pressed Amazon on whether it used data gleaned from other sellers to favor its own products. \u201cThe best purchase to you is an Amazon product,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.). \u201cNo that\u2019s not true,\u201d replied Nate Sutton, an Amazon associate general counsel, saying Amazon\u2019s \u201calgorithms are optimized to predict what customers want to buy regardless of the seller.\u201d House Judiciary Committee leaders recently asked Amazon to provide executive communications related to product searches on the site as part of a probe on anticompetitive behavior at technology companies.\n\nAmazon says it operates in fiercely competitive markets, it represents less than 1% of global retail and its private-label business represents about 1% of its retail sales.\n\nAmazon executives have sought to boost profitability in its retail business after years of focusing on growth. A majority of its $12.4 billion in operating income last year came from its growing cloud business.\n\nPressure on engineers\n\nAn account of Amazon\u2019s search-system adjustment emerges from interviews with people familiar with the internal discussions, including some who worked on the project, as well as former executives familiar with Amazon\u2019s private-label business.\n\nShare Your Thoughts When you search for products on Amazon, how should it determine what listings to show? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe A9 team\u2014named for the \u201cA\u201d in \u201cAlgorithms\u201d plus its nine other letters\u2014controls the all-important search and ranking functions on Amazon\u2019s site. Like other technology giants, Amazon keeps its algorithm a closely guarded secret, even internally, for competitive reasons and to prevent sellers from gaming the system.\n\nCustomers often believe that search algorithms are neutral and objective, and that results from their queries are the most relevant listings.\n\nExecutives from Amazon\u2019s retail divisions have frequently pressured the engineers at A9 to surface their products higher in search results, people familiar with the discussions said. Amazon\u2019s retail teams not only oversee its own branded products but also its wholesale vendors and vast marketplace of third-party sellers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s private-label team in particular had for several years asked A9 to juice sales of Amazon\u2019s in-house products, some of these people said. The company sells over 10,000 products under its own brands, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse, ranging from everyday goods such as AmazonBasics batteries and Presto paper towels, to clothing such as Lark & Ro dresses.\n\nInside an Amazon fulfillment center.

Investment firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey estimates the private-label business will post $31 billion in sales by 2022, more than Macy\u2019s Inc. \u2019s annual revenue last year.\n\nThe private-label executives argued Amazon should promote its own items in search results, these people said. They pointed to grocery-store chains and drugstores that showcase their private-label products alongside national brands and promote them in-store.\n\nA9 executives pushed back and said such a change would conflict with Chief Executive Jeff Bezos\u2019 \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d mantra, these people said. The first of Amazon\u2019s longstanding list of 14 leadership principles requires managers to focus on earning and keeping customer trust above all. Amazon often repeats a line from that principle: \u201cLeaders start with the customer and work backwards.\u201d\n\nOne former Amazon search executive said: \u201cWe fought tooth and nail with those guys, because of course they wanted preferential treatment in search.\u201d\n\nFor years, A9 had operated independently from the retail operations, reporting to its own CEO. But the search team, in Silicon Valley about a two-hour flight from Seattle, now reports to retail chief Doug Herrington and his boss Jeff Wilke \u2014effectively leaving search to answer to retail.\n\nAfter the Journal\u2019s inquiries, Amazon took down its A9 website, which had stood for about a decade and a half. The site included the statement: \u201cOne of A9\u2019s tenets is that relevance is in the eye of the customer and we strive to get the best results for our users.\u201d\n\nMr. Herrington\u2019s retail team lobbied for the adjustment to Amazon\u2019s search algorithm that led to emphasizing profitability, some of the people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nWhen a customer enters a search query for a product on Amazon, the system scours all listings for such an item and considers more than 100 variables\u2014some Amazon engineers call them \u201cfeatures.\u201d These variables might include shipping speed, how highly buyers have ranked product listings and recent sales volumes of specific listings. The algorithm weighs those variables while calculating which listings to present the customer and in which order.\n\nNate Sutton, an Amazon associate general counsel, at a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on antitrust in July. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nThe algorithm had long placed a priority on variables such as unit sales\u2014a proxy for popularity\u2014and search-term relevance, because they tend to predict customer satisfaction. A listing\u2019s profitability to Amazon has never been one of these variables.\n\nProfit metric\n\nAmazon retail executives, especially those in its private-label business, wanted to add a new variable for what the company calls \u201ccontribution profit,\u201d considered a better measure of a product\u2019s profitability because it factors in non-fixed expenses such as shipping and advertising, leaving the amount left over to cover Amazon\u2019s fixed costs, said people familiar with the discussion.\n\nAmazon\u2019s private-label products are designed to be more profitable than competing items, said people familiar with the business, because the company controls the manufacturing and distribution and cuts out intermediaries and marketing costs.\n\nAmazon\u2019s lawyers rejected the overt addition of contribution profit into the algorithm, pointing to a \u20ac2.42 billion fine ($2.7 billion at the time) that Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google received in 2017 from European regulators who found it used its search engine to stack the deck in favor of its comparison-shopping service, said one of the people familiar with the discussions. Google has appealed the fine and has made changes to Google Shopping in response to the European Commission\u2019s order.\n\nTo assuage the lawyers\u2019 concerns, Amazon executives looked at ways to account for profitability without adding it directly to the algorithm. They turned to the metrics Amazon uses to test the algorithm\u2019s success in reaching certain business objectives, said the people who worked on the project.\n\nWhen engineers test new variables in the algorithm, Amazon gauges the results against a handful of metrics. Among these metrics: unit sales of listings and the dollar value of orders for listings. Positive results for the metrics correlated with high customer satisfaction and helped determine the ranking of listings a search presented to the customer.\n\nNow, engineers would need to consider another metric\u2014improving profitability\u2014said the people who worked on the project. Variables added to the algorithm would essentially become what one of these people called \u201cproxies\u201d for profit: The variables would correlate with improved profitability for Amazon, but an outside observer might not be able to tell that. The variables could also inherently be good for the customer.\n\nMoney Flow Amazon commands more than one-third of U.S. retail dollars spent online. Share of 2018 online retail sales Amazon 36.5% eBay 6.9% Walmart 4.0% Apple 3.9% The Home Depot 1.6%\n\nFor the algorithm to understand what was most profitable for Amazon, the engineers had to import data on contribution profit for all items sold, these people said. The laborious process meant extracting shipping information from Amazon warehouses to calculate contribution profit.\n\nIn an internal system called Weblab, A9 engineers tested proposed variables for the algorithm for weeks on a subset of Amazon shoppers and compared the impact on contribution profit, unit sales and a few other metrics against a control group, these people said. When comparing the results of the groups, profitability now appeared alongside other metrics on a display called the \u201cdashboard.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s A9 team has since added new variables that have resulted in search results that scored higher on the profitability metric during testing, said a person involved in the effort, who declined to say what those new variables were. New variables would also have to improve Amazon\u2019s other metrics, such as unit sales.\n\nA review committee that approves all additions to the algorithm has sent engineers back if their proposed variable produces search results with a lower score on the profitability metric, this person said. \u201cYou are making an incentive system for engineers to build features that directly or indirectly improve profitability,\u201d the person said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not a good thing.\u201d\n\nAn Amazon warehouse in Mexico in July. Photo: Carlos Jasso/Reuters\n\nAmazon said it doesn\u2019t automatically shelve improvements that aren\u2019t profitable. It said, as an example, that it recently improved the discoverability of items that could be delivered the same day even though it hurt profitability.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Ms. Newman said: \u201cWhen we test any new features, including search features, we look at a number of metrics, including long term profitability, to see how these new features impact the customer experience and our business as any rational store would, but we do not make decisions based on that one metric.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, Amazon\u2019s broader shift from showing relevant search results is noticeable on the site. Last summer, it changed the default sorting option\u2014without publicizing the move\u2014to \u201cfeatured\u201d after ranking the search results for years by \u201crelevance,\u201d according to a Journal analysis for this article of screenshots and postings by users online. Relevance is no longer an option in the small \u201csort by\u201d drop-down button on the top right of the page.\n\nWrite to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com", "description": "The e-commerce giant overcame internal dissent from engineers and lawyers, people familiar with the move say.", "authors": ["Dana Mattioli", "Dana.Mattioli Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-DC970_201908_SOC_20190829172453.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
