Mark Phelan, Detroit Free Press Auto Critic\n\nThe \u2605\u2605\u2605 2019 BMW 330i sport sedan explores how to meld the brand\u2019s claim to be the \u201cultimate driving machine\u201d with rising levels of driver assistance, but it locks down the title for the \u201cultimate display of gall by an automaker.\u201d\n\nFor 2020, BMW moved from its previous practice of charging customers once for a feature other brands made standard years ago to requiring an annual subscription fee, in perpetuity.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about Apple CarPlay here. It\u2019s standard equipment in vehicles including the Chevy Equinox, Honda Civic and Hyundai Sonata. I name those three competitors because you could buy one of each for less than the $58,925 sticker of the 330i I recently tested.\n\nCarPlay reduces driver distraction significantly by using excellent voice recognition to easily access the smartphone features you\u2019re most likely to want while driving: Navigation, music, phone calls and finding a business\u2019s address or phone number. It reads text messages to you and takes dictation for replies. It also projects driving-friendly versions of those features on the vehicle\u2019s touch screen.\n\nNo infotainment system is perfect, but CarPlay comes close. It significantly reduces the temptation to take your eyes off the road and provides limited, simple touch screen features you can use about as easily as reaching for a volume or tuning knob.\n\nMore from Mark Phelan:\n\n2020 Chevrolet Corvette convertible shares this feature with classic race cars\n\nNames of luxury Lincoln vehicles are part of strategic plan\n\nBMW charges $80 a year or a flat fee of $300 for Apple CarPlay, a connectivity feature many automakers offer as standard equipment. (Photo: BMW)\n\nBMW makes the first year of CarPlay free, so you\u2019ve got plenty of time to get hooked on how valuable the feature is. After that, BMW owners must pay $80 a year to keep the feature, every year you own the 330i, unless you choose to pay an extra $300 upfront for lifetime coverage.\n\nThe charges apply to every BMW that has a navigation system, including $100,000-plus vehicles like the glorious 8-series coupe.\n\nIt\u2019s an avaricious policy customers should scorn and resist. Apple does not participate in the policy or get any of the subscription money BMW takes in.\n\nIn fact, Apple doesn't charge automakers a cent for CarPlay. The company considers it just another update to its iPhone operating system, like all the other free updates it provides. Automakers' only cost is the engineering to make the infotainment system compatible with iPhones.\n\nWe\u2019ll get back to CarPlay, but first, a few words about the pretty good car this money grab came wrapped in.\n\nThe 330i's' wireless Apple CarPlay's connection was inconsistent. (Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nThe 3-series sports sedan has been BMW\u2019s signature car for decades. The seventh-generation car went on sale as a 2019 model. I drove one just as the model years changed, but there were no meaningful changes in 330i features or price for the 2020s that are on sale now. BMW did add more powerful and expensive M340i models for 2020. I have not tested an M340i yet.\n\nBMW dropped the base 320i model when the new 3-series arrived. The entry-level model for 2019 and 2020 becomes the 330i, with more power and standard features. The 320i had just 180 horsepower. The old-gen 330i got 248 and 258 pound-feet of torque from the same displacement. The bigger 330i sees torque improve impressively to 295 pound-feet. Horsepower grows more modestly to 255.\n\nBMW 330i (Photo: Mark Phelan)\n\nAn 8-speed automatic transmission is the only gearbox offered, the first time the 3-series hasn\u2019t offered a manual gearbox.\n\nThe new 3-series is 2.9 inches longer than its predecessor, but passenger and luggage space didn\u2019t change much. Rear legroom remains tight. Weight increased about 40 pounds. That\u2019s modest, particularly considering how many features BMW added, including contemporary driver assistance features.\n\nHow much?\n\nThe handsome instrument cluster shows a map of the vicinity behind the gauges. (Photo: BMW 330i)\n\nDropping the 320i base model meant the base price for the 3-series as a whole significantly, but model for model \u2013 2018 330i to 2019 330i \u2013 the price was unchanged at $40,250. That rose to $40,750 for 2020.\n\nOptional features on the 330i I tested included:\n\nBlind spot and cross-traffic alerts\n\nLane departure alert\n\nLane-keeping steering assist\n\nAdaptive cruise control\n\nTraffic jam assist to follow the vehicle ahead hands-free up to 37 mph\n\nHead-up display\n\nWireless charging\n\nWireless Apple CarPlay\n\n19-inch alloy wheels\n\nAdaptive M suspension\n\nLED lights\n\nRemote start\n\nHeated front seats and steering wheel\n\nHarman Kardon audio.\n\nThe 330i's base price is very competitive with sport sedans like the Alfa Romeo Giulia, Audi A4, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS, Mercedes C300 and Volvo S60. As the list above suggests, options add up fast, however.\n\nMy test car stickered at $58,925, securely in the upper strata of sport sedans with comparable powertrains.\n\nDriving impressions\n\nThe new 330i\u2019s changes in power and weight are modest, so your expectations of performance should be, too.\n\nThe 2019/20 accelerates from 0-60 mph in 5.6 seconds by BMW account, 0.1 slower than the 2018.\n\nDespite that, throttle response is good. The 330i accelerates with authority around town and on the highway.\n\nThe BMW 330i's 2.0L turbocharged engine produces 255 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque. (Photo: BMW 330i)\n\nThe EPA rates the 330i at 26 mpg in the city, 36 mpg on the highway and 30 mpg in combined driving. The key combined figure ties the Audi A4 for the lead. The other competitors I\u2019ve named trail by 2 to 6 mpg.\n\nThe 330i\u2019s handling is sharp and precise, despite its increased size and weight. The electric power steering is exceptionally quick but adjusts for a clear on-center feel on the highway. The new body and suspension combine to create a ride that\u2019s comfortable but also keeps the car stable and planted in sharp maneuvers.\n\nStyling changes are evolutionary.\n\nPaying for CarPlay?\n\nBMW says its fee for CarPlay reflects the engineering changes it will make to keep the feature up to date as technology evolves.\n\nThat sounds sort of like the downloads to the features and operating system of your iPhone \u2026 except, of course, Apple provides those for free, apparently on the assumption that its customers expect their device kept up to date.\n\nTrunk size is almost unchanged from the previous model. (Photo: BMW 330i)\n\nEven brand-new, the wireless application of CarPlay worked inconsistently. BMW\u2019s process to pair your phone is also less intuitive than the leaders.\n\nAt some point, of course, Apple stops providing updates, as new features outstrip the hardware of old devices. BMW promises to keep updating CarPlay for 20 years if you keep paying, but that promise will be sorely tested if Apple\u2019s technology outstrips the car\u2019s hardware.\n\nApple wasn\u2019t involved in BMW\u2019s decision to charge for CarPlay. Nor did Apple modify the feature so BMW can shut CarPlay off if you stop paying for updates.\n\nBMW sold 232,427 vehicles in North America through September. If every owner paid $80 a year for CarPlay, that\u2019s $18.5 million revenue a year for nine months\u2019 sales in North America alone, and North America accounts for less than 15% of BMW\u2019s global sales.\n\nEven at German labor rates, that looks like a rather aggressive markup over the actual cost of sending an over-the-air or downloadable update like the ones most cars will soon get for many systems.\n\nI hope BMW owners balk at the charge. If one automaker can get away with charging for CarPlay \u2013 and eventually its counterpart Android Auto \u2013 it\u2019s only a matter of time before others do the same thing.\n\nCarPlay works so well it should be available to as many drivers as possible.\n\nContact Mark Phelan: 313-222-6731 or mmphelan@freepress.com.
