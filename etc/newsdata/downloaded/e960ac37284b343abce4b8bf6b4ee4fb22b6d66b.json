But those advisers say her liberal stances on some issues and her \"likeability\" problem with segments of general election voters make her weaker against Trump than even a Biden hindered by gaffes, generational dissonances and a son with personal drama and a lobbying record.\n\n\"He still feels safe,\" a Trump campaign adviser said of how U.S. voters perceive Biden. The former vice president is not saying \"crazy, radical\" things and \"people think Biden will bring some semblance of normalcy.\"\n\nThe president's supporters also insist that Warren would put more states in play than most anyone: \"She makes winning Wisconsin a sh*tload easier, and Michigan \u2014 are you kidding me?!\" a former White House official said.\n\nTo date, the attack strategy Trump's team has tested most successfully with voters who backed him in 2016 is painting Dem candidates as socialists, and it's a lot easier to stick a socialism tag on Warren than on Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump campaign adviser Brad Parscale has long thought Warren may be the eventual nominee \u2014 and privately relishes the notion of running against her.\n\nBut, but, but: Analysts and some Democratic strategists say Trump's team may be underestimating Warren's potency.\n\n\"It\u2019s easy to say Warren is a weaker general election candidate than Biden \u2014 but that may not be true,\" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of political website Sabato's Crystal Ball. \"It may be that Warren better excites Democrats and/or has a populist economic message that is better suited for the moment.\"\n\nOur thought bubble: Two of Trump's biggest weapons in 2016 were the huge crowds he was turning out \u2014 spectacles neither his primary opponents nor Hillary Clinton could conjure \u2014 and a fundraising juggernaut from small- and high-dollar donors.\n\nBut Warren is at the top of the Democratic primary's fundraising field, just behind Bernie Sanders, and has turned out massive crowds at her events.\n\nShe raised $24.6 million in Q3, and the average contribution to her campaign was $26.\n\nMore than 20,000 people turned out for her rally in New York\u2019s Washington Square Park last month, a number so high even Trump didn't believe it.\n\nLike Trump, many of her policies are populist. Her messaging is centered on looking out for the little guy/gal and appealing to people who feel they\u2019ve been left behind by the government.\n\nShe\u2019s rising in the polls with moderate and conservative Democratic voters and a lot of people who like the idea of canceling student debt and lifting up the working class at the expense of billionaires.\n\nMeanwhile, a Biden adviser tells Alexi that this assessment \"makes sense\": \"He's attacked Joe Biden with lies and conspiracy theories since the moment he got into this race in April, and Biden's support has remained steadfast and strong. That terrifies Trump.\"", "description": "Trump's allies still fear a general election matchup against a banged-up Joe Biden more than an invigorated Elizabeth Warren.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/3oqVN6VagMc9VK57AE09RufWBZg=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/13/1571003204999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
