What better way to get the American people on your side than by causing their morning work commute to become an even bigger headache by forcing thousands of drivers to sit in stand still traffic. In an attempt to convince climate skeptics that climate change (formally known as global warming until a few predictions by Al Gore didn't pan out) is real, hundreds of leftist protesters are currently demonstrating in the streets of Washington, D.C. by hurling confetti, blocking traffic, and warning about carbon emissions...while at the same time causing motor vehicles to just sit there emitting carbon dioxide. Their ultimate goal is to \"Shut Down D.C.\" until the government enacts climate change legislation.\n\nA coalition of environmental whackos demanding \"climate justice\" Monday morning filled the streets of our nation's capital causing gridlock. Here's some of the action on Twitter.\n\nI\u2019m in downtown DC where climate activists with Extinction Rebellion have blocked the intersection of K and 16th streets with a big sailboat that says \u201crebel for life.\u201d @WTOP @WTOPtraffic #ShutDownDC pic.twitter.com/NWIO1aRvM3 \u2014 Alejandro Alvarez (@aletweetsnews) September 23, 2019\n\nThe climate protesters are now throwing confetti and dancing in the intersection while chanting \"Climate Justice, now!\" pic.twitter.com/ozkZZVLJuT \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) September 23, 2019\n\nClimate protesters on my way to work decide that their protest is more important than a low-income worker\u2019s job pic.twitter.com/DHuBjlMGqm \u2014 Katrina B Haydon??

We're here because we need the leaders in that building to wake up and start acting like our house is on fire. Because it is. #ShutDownDC pic.twitter.com/sTdlW2oclE \u2014 350 DC (@350_DC) September 23, 2019\n\nCurious what causing thousands of cars to idle together in place does for the environment. #ClimateStrikedc pic.twitter.com/22B6O2oQ5T \u2014 Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) September 23, 2019\n\nAs you can tell from just five tweets out of hundreds, the overall impact of the protest is pollution, inane ramblings, and one giant headache for everybody in D.C. trying to actually work. What a waste of time.", "description": ".09/23/2019 13:21:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/43/2e76ee5c-0ce4-490c-b489-ef0e0035bb7c.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
