No accidents have been linked to the problem.\n\nThe issue doesn\u2019t affect the latest-generation Ram 1500 that was introduced last year, on 2014-2019 trucks that were marketed in 2019 as the Ram 1500 Classic.\n\nFiat Chrysler said the injuries were sustained when owners were attempting to put out fires themselves. Recall notices will be sent out soon.
