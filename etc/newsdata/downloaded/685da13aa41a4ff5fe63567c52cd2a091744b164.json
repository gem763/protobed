She saw. She conquered.\n\nIn a more-than-three-hour-long hearing Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition chief, batted away questions from lawmakers about the role of U.S. tech companies in people's lives, the need to overhaul taxation rules for the online world, and how Europe could better compete with its global rivals.\n\n\u201cMy pledge is not to make Europe like China or like America,\u201d the Danish politician said in her opening remarks. \"My pledge is to make Europe more like itself.\"\n\nShortly after the hearing ended, MEPs announced that she'd won backing from the European Parliament\u2019s industry, internal market and economic affairs committees.\n\n\u201cAll the [political] groups except [the far-right Identity and Democracy] supported her,\u201d tweeted MEP Christel Schaldemose, coordinator of the internal market committee for the Socialists & Democrats group and a fellow Dane. Two officials from the European People\u2019s Party confirmed the information to POLITICO.\n\n\"One thing I have learned from surveillance capitalism is that it's not you searching Google, but Google searching you\" \u2014 Margrethe Vestager, during her hearing\n\nDefining what Vestager meant by her Europe pledge is at the heart of her new mandate \u2014 one that combines her existing role as the Commission's top antitrust enforcer with a wide-ranging position as executive vice president for digital affairs. The second part of her remit grants her authority over several commissioners and covers everything from devising new artificial intelligence rules to helping local startups expand beyond the 28-country bloc.\n\nIn an assured performance, the Dane outlined her priorities for the next five years.\n\nMuch of her emphasis was on the need to revamp global taxation rules and rein in dominant tech companies \u2014 though Vestager stopped short of endorsing calls to break up digital giants.\n\n\"We have that tool in our toolbox,\" Vestager said, in reference to the Commission's powers to break up companies on competition grounds. \"But this is very far-reaching, very intrusive.\"\n\nOther nominees for the incoming Commission, most notably Sylvie Goulard, the French politician slated to be in charge of the EU\u2019s internal market, have faced tough questioning from MEPs. Goulard faces a further hearing or even a vote against her nomination due to concerns about an ongoing legal probe in France and a lucrative consulting contract.\n\nBut the Dane \u2014 known globally for her multibillion-euro fines and other penalties against Google and Apple \u2014 received a much warmer welcome, to the point that she was congratulated by some lawmakers for her efforts to rein in Big Tech.\n\nDespite the almost lap-of-honor feel to the parliamentary hearing, Vestager faces tough choices when she takes office in November.\n\nThe thorniest challenge has to do with her dual role as the EU\u2019s competition czar and cheerleader-in-chief for Europe's digital economy.\n\nShe acknowledged the challenge of reconciling the two functions in her answers. But she did not detail how she would juggle the conflicting mandates to protect European consumers from market abuses while also helping local firms compete on the global stage.\n\nDuring the lengthy hearing in Brussels, however, Vestager went further than ever before in outlining what she viewed were Europe's advantages in the online world.\n\n\u201cSome say China has all the data, and the U.S. has all the money. But in Europe, we have purpose\" \u2014 Margrethe Vestager, during her hearing\n\nShe also underscored where more legislation or enforcement would be needed to rein in digital giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon.\n\nWith data becoming the lifeblood of the digital economy, Vestager said that European citizens must be given greater choice in how such information is used, adding that she would continue looking at competition cases that involved the potential monopolization of digital information.\n\nMore than once, she referred to so-called surveillance capitalism, in which online companies harvest reams of individuals' data, often with little oversight from either regulators or consumers.\n\n\"One thing I have learned from surveillance capitalism is that it's not you searching Google, but Google searching you,\" she told MEPs. \u201cWe need to regulate how companies collect, store and use data so it helps society.\"\n\nVestager also pushed Europe's claim to set the rules of the road for the global digital economy, namely as regards artificial intelligence and online taxation.\n\n\u201cSome say China has all the data, and the U.S. has all the money,\" she told lawmakers. \"But in Europe, we have purpose.\"\n\nThe current Commission, which has been in place since 2014, has not been shy in exporting its own rulemaking.\n\nThe region's existing data protection rules, for instance, have become the global de facto standard, becoming part of domestic legislation in countries from Argentina to Japan.\n\nThe Danish politician said digital taxation rules needed to be revamped for the 21st century, and backed current efforts by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to find a global consensus, which are expected to lead to tentative proposals in the coming weeks.\n\nBut, Vestager added, Europe would go it alone in imposing its own online tax rules on firms like Google and Facebook if a global agreement could not be reached, adding that she admired member states that had moved ahead with their own unilateral laws.\n\nThe Dane also said she would continue to move forward in using the Commission's state aid powers to force individual EU countries to claw back taxes from global companies if they were found to have been given unfair tax rulings compared to others. Such powers were used to force Apple to repay \u20ac13 billion to the Irish government, a decision that both the iPhone maker and Dublin are appealing.\n\n\u201cI hope we will find a global agreement\u201d on digital taxation, Vestager said in the hearing. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, we will table and push for a European solution.\"\n\nLaura Kayali, Simon Van Dorpe and Thibault Larger contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
