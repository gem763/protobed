There\u2019s a really good chance that any money you\u2019ve lost is not in the name of a distant aunt. It\u2019s in your name and just a phone call away.\n\nIf you\u2019ve had more than one job \u2014 the government estimates that we have 12 over a career \u2014 you probably started at least one 401(k) retirement plan. Maybe two or three.\n\nFor many people, the money they put into a 401(k) feels inconsequential at the time. After all, it\u2019s a small percentage of their check. Maybe they contribute for a year or two then move on to the next job.\n\nLet\u2019s do a thought experiment: Imagine you have the average 401(k) balance of an employee between the ages of 30 and 39. Fidelity Investments currently estimates that to be $42,400.\n\nThe problem is that your $42,400 is not neatly packaged up at one old job. More likely it\u2019s $9,000 in one place and $4,500 in another and so on, a scattered trail of abandoned money.\n\nStealth wealth\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Even though you haven\u2019t put a penny into any of those plans for years, they\u2019ve still been growing with the stock market.\n\nIf you\u2019re in your 50s and thinking about retirement, ordinary compounding suggests you could have $170,000 sitting in old plans. In some parts of the country that\u2019s the cost of a house.\n\nEven more compelling is that your missing $170,000 could be consolidated into a retirement IRA that you control. As many as 600,000 workers abandon 401(k) money per year, leaving behind $1.5 billion of their own money.\n\nYet Americans are blissfully unaware of the truly prohibitive cost of most small-company 401(k) plans. Normally, abandoned 401(k) money is redirected by plans into \u201csafe\u201d short-term investments, such as a money market account or bond fund.\n\nThere, your money can get socked by stiff 401(k) fees until it disappears completely, typically in just a few years, according to a study by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nIn comparison, a personal IRA is cheap to run, particularly if you use low-cost index funds. You get the same tax breaks at a tiny fraction of the 401(k) price. Your money grows rather than shrinks.\n\nIf you want to buy your own index funds, fantastic. If you want to build a true investment portfolio, even better. And if you want fiduciary investment and financial planning advice to go along with that portfolio, that too is more affordable than ever.\n\nGo rescue your money\n\nFinding and verifying old 401(k) accounts may seem daunting at first, but a good financial adviser can help you sleuth it out. A few simple forms and your retirement picture could look a whole lot brighter.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had a retirement plan of any size and can\u2019t recall what you put into it, you owe it to yourself to find out. Not taking action could mean losing out.\n\nYour little slice of 401(k) money might not seem like much, but it\u2019s your money. Be your own hero and rescue it. Why leave your cash in some old employer plan, just to wither away?", "description": "Follow the trail of abandoned money.", "authors": ["Mitch Tuchman"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT794_sherlo_ZG_20191022115616.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
