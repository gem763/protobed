This is Money podcast", "language": "en", "text": "The best time to get a good deal on buying something is when other people don\u2019t want to.\n\nThat should theoretically make now a decent time to try to buy a property, but will that work in practice?\n\nThe property market has run out of steam and house prices are rising at a far more moderate rate than in recent years\n\nWhile the headline figures mask regional differences \u2013 London and the South East have seen prices fall, while cheaper areas are still seeing gains \u2013 even drilling down into the numbers shows most places are slowing.\n\nRightmove reported this week that the traditional back to school bounce was cancelled, as asking prices failed to rise for the first time in September since 2010 this month.\n\nMeanwhile, the ONS, Nationwide and Halifax reports have all pointed to a period of much slower house price inflation.\n\nSet against that is the anecdotal evidence from London agents, who are saying that bolder buyers are picking up some good deals at the moment as sellers lower their expectations.\n\nThe problem is that often to buy a house you need to sell one and - even if you can do that - estate agents and analysts point to a distinct lack of properties being put up for sale.\n\nOn this week\u2019s podcast, Simon Lambert, Georgie Frost and Grace Gausden dive into the reports on what is going on in the property market, to try to answer the question of whether now is a good time to buy.\n\nAlso on this week\u2019s show, the team discuss energy vampires and what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false in energy saving claims. The delay to the smart meter rollout is on the agenda too.\n\nAs the Climate Strike arrives, they debate whether buying carbon credits to make up for flying is wise - or whether we should just be flying less instead.\n\nAnd finally, if you fancy doing the complete opposite, the podcast finishes with a look at why now is the best time to book Christmas flights\u2026 or do your bit and get the train instead.", "description": "The best time to get a good deal on buying something is when other people don't want to.
