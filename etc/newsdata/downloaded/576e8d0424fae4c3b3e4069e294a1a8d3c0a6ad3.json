First of all, a candidate often makes promises during a primary to appeal to particular constituencies. The candidate usually will need those same groups to be strongly behind him or her in the general election. (For example, Obama embraced universal health care during the 2008 primary in part to appeal to the leaders of major labor unions.) Also, flip-flopping on your core stances is likely to draw negative press coverage. Finally, recent Democratic nominees (Clinton, Obama, John Kerry and Al Gore) didn\u2019t center their candidacies in the primary around the idea that they were the most liberal Democrat. So those four arguably didn\u2019t take as many bold and potentially electorally risky stances as Warren and Sanders, who have made liberalism a centerpiece of their presidential runs.\n\nBut Democratic nominees in the past have made other concessions to the idea of \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d voters. The most prominent one has tended to be in their picks for vice president. The four most recent Democratic nominees all chose running mates whose role was in part to help the person at the top of the ticket appeal to more conservative voters.", "description": "", "authors": ["Perry Bacon", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features Would-Warren-Or-Sanders-Move-To-The-Center-Against-Trump"], "top_image": ""}
