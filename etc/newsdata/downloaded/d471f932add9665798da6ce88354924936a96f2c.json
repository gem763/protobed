Some 400,000 overdose-related deaths in the US between 1997 and 2017 were linked to opioids, according to government data.\n\nOn Friday, talks collapsed aimed at reaching a broader $48bn settlement covering thousands of lawsuits filed by counties, towns and states from across the country over the opioid crisis.\n\nThe value of the settlement could not be determined. Opening arguments at trial were scheduled to begin at 9:30am in Cleveland (13:30 GMT).\n\nThe story could not immediately be verified and the Wall Street Journal did not report the terms of the settlement, however, The Associated Press reported that a lawyer had confirmed that a deal had been reached.\n\nLawyers were seen hugging and congratulating each other outside the courtroom.\n\nThe outcome of the trial was expected to help shape a broader settlement of the more than 2,300 lawsuits against a larger number of defendants, including health conglomerate Johnson & Johnson.", "description": "Four drug companies reportedly reached a last-minute legal settlement over their role in the opioid addiction epidemic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/f44b1a9a526146f3992efb01032e16be_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
