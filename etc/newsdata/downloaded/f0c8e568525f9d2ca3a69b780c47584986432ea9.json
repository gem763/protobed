One person was found dead in the house. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nSandra Reyes, one of 10 occupants of a two-story house in Fairfax County, said she ate dinner Monday night, took some medicine and went to bed. A while later, after 9 p.m., she was awakened by someone pounding on a window. She said she got up, opened the door of her room and saw a wall of black smoke.\n\n\u201cI was scared,\u201d said Reyes, 19. Choking and panicking, she thought, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d Then she turned toward the window, the only way to escape, and climbed out with help from the man who had banged on it.\n\nBut not all of her fellow residents were as fortunate.\n\nThe blaze, in the 3400 block of Elmwood Drive, in the county\u2019s Alexandria section, left one person dead, authorities said, adding that four others were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. They said a firefighter also needed medical attention.\n\nAs of Tuesday, officials had not publicly identified the dead man. Reyes said he was from Peru. A Red Cross representative said the man was in his 60s.\n\nInvestigators on Tuesday were still trying to determine the cause of the fire, which gutted the house, causing more than $300,000 in damage. Officials said the first firefighters to arrive found power lines down near the front of the home.\n\n\n\nA child's car seat is among the items strewn about the yard after a fatal fire burned through a two-story home in the 3400 block of Elmwood Drive in the Alexandria section of Fairfax County on Sept. 24, 2019. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cFive occupants were home when the fire was discovered,\u201d the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department said in a statement. They said the man who died was on the second floor.\n\nReyes, who was treated for smoke inhalation, said she rented a room at the home and that there were other tenants including two families, one with a small boy, living in about eight rented rooms. She said the man who helped her get out had leaped to safety from a second-floor window.\n\nShortly after the blaze broke out, \u201can occupant in an upstairs bedroom smelled smoke,\u201d the fire department statement said. \u201cUpon investigation, the occupants discovered the fire and alerted the remaining occupants to the fire. Four occupants self-evacuated through windows prior to fire department arrival.\u201d\n\nThe home had working smoke alarms that activated after the fire was discovered, the statement said.\n\nNine people, including Reyes, were displaced by the fire. Prewitt Diaz, a disaster mental health worker for the American Red Cross of the National Capital Region, said his agency was providing a range of services, including food and shelter.\n\n\n\nA young man who said he is not a resident exits a house after a fire burned through it in the 3400 block of Elmwood Drive in the Alexandria section of Fairfax County on Sept. 24, 2019.

Police also said they had not received any complaints about code compliance.\n\nReyes said she lost everything she owned in the blaze except for the sneakers, T-shirt and sweatpants she wore during her escape. \u201cI don\u2019t even had socks on,\u201d she said.\n\nThe owner of the house, Oralia De Leon, stood with a friend in front of her ruined property Tuesday. She said she was at work when the fire broke out, and she does not know what caused it. She said the man who died did not have relatives in the United States.\n\n\u201cI have nothing,\u201d she said in a phone interview earlier Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m here on the street.\u201d\n\nNear her home, De Leon cried softly as her friend embraced her.\n\nRead more:\n\nOne accused teacher, 8,000 lewd images: A school\u2019s exploitation shows no place is safe from hidden cameras anymore\n\nHe had \u2018goals and a vision.\u2019 Jamel Kirkland is D.C.\u2019s eighth victim age 11 to 17 to be fatally shot this year.\n\nFound insane in one killing, D.C. police say this man killed again\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "One man died in the blaze, officials said, and nine others were displaced.", "authors": ["Justin Jouvenal", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Policing", "Antonio Olivo", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Demographics In Northern Virginia", "Paul Duggan", "Crime Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0GkU2h0Ze3jhf9UKoB_fr5fS81c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33BLD3W7A4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
