Picture taken September 5, 2019. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nCitigroup, the third-largest U.S. card issuer, according to payments industry publication The Nilson Report, has been among the most aggressive promoters of zero-interest balance transfers.\n\nFor a small fee, customers can move debt from a rival card onto Citi\u2019s plastic and pay no interest for 21 months. That is currently the longest 0% deal in the industry, according to consumer finance company Bankrate LLC. Rivals offer 15 interest-free months with no fee.\n\nThe card business now accounts for nearly one-third of Citigroup\u2019s overall revenue and is one of the biggest potential drivers of future earnings growth.\n\nBut some analysts and investors worry this portfolio could become a liability if the economy goes south. The bank continues to advertise zero-interest deals on popular personal finance websites and through mailers, even as competitors have scaled back.\n\n\u201cJust recognizing where we are in the credit cycle, it\u2019s interesting to see Citigroup doubling down and pushing forward,\u201d said Moody\u2019s analyst Warren Kornfeld.\n\nCredit card customers who use balance transfers are considered higher risk because they often use the easy financing to accumulate more debt, according to bank analysts and credit underwriters.\n\nWall Street\u2019s worst fears lie with borrowers such as Jacqueline Alvarado, a Pennsylvania truck driver who now owes $12,000. Over the past five years, Alvarado says she has moved balances around on 19 cards, including one from Citigroup, to avoid finance charges. If the promotional offers dry up, she said, so do her hopes of paying off that debt.\n\nZero interest is \u201cthe only way I can stay afloat,\u201d said Alvarado, 40.\n\nIn interviews with Reuters, Citigroup executives defended their card strategy and tough underwriting standards they say will protect the bank from major losses in the event of a downturn.\n\nCitigroup\u2019s card business has reported delinquency rates far below the industry average in recent years, according to federal data and filings. In addition, 83% of consumers in its American credit card business, excluding its retail partnership cards, have credit scores of 680, which is considered a good score, according to credit rating firm Experian.\n\n(For a graphic on Citigroup's credit card delinquencies and charge-offs, see: tmsnrt.rs/2ZtH9QF)\n\nTEMPTING BORROWERS\n\nCitigroup counts on customers sticking around after the promotional period expires. With annual percentage rates of up to 27% on its cards, the profits on borrowers who carry balances can be juicy.\n\nThe strategy so far is paying off. Interest-bearing balances rose 10% in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. That growth helped boost overall profits on consumer lending by 9%.\n\nAnand Selva, the bank\u2019s head of consumer strategy, said he expects the business to continue picking up steam.\n\nCitigroup shares have rallied more than 20% so far this year. The KBW Banking Index, the benchmark stock index for the U.S. banking sector, rose 6% over the same period.\n\nSelva says Citigroup has taken other steps to encourage cardholders to do more than transfer balances. For example, it has sweetened its reward program by rounding up to the nearest 10 reward points on every new purchase. And it has introduced installment loans linked to credit lines for large purchases.\n\nMajor card rivals, meanwhile, are proceeding more cautiously.\n\nDiscover Financial Services, known for flooding mailboxes with promotions, has said on analyst calls that it is paring those offers and tightening personal loan underwriting over concerns the economy is slowing. Capital One Financial Corp, which pioneered balance transfers in the early 1990s, similarly told analysts and investors it has become more conservative in extending credit lines while targeting wealthier clients who typically do not carry balances.\n\nBank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co, two of the biggest card lenders, have grown their businesses by prioritizing affluent consumers over people already carrying credit card debt, according to analysts.\n\nCARD CRUTCH\n\nCitigroup has leaned more on its card business since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The bank required three government bailouts when its U.S. subprime mortgage business turned toxic and caused it to shrink its portfolio to stem losses.\n\nIt sold its retail wealth management unit to Morgan Stanley, and it no longer engages in traditional mortgage and auto lending. Citigroup now has one-fifth the number of U.S. branches as its primary competitors.\n\nSo it has turned to its card business to drive growth and lure deposits.\n\nThe bank now earns more than half of its consumer profit and revenue from cards. And it markets online checking and savings accounts to its 28 million cardholders. Doing so helped Citigroup add $2 billion in consumer deposits during the first half of 2019. That is more than double what it gathered all of last year.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAnalysts said the business will be a bright spot for Citigroup - as long as the economy remains healthy. U.S. banks suffered $87 billion in losses on credit card loans from 2009-2010 in the wake of the financial crisis, according to a Federal Reserve report.\n\nAlvarado, the truck driver, said she has been slowly chipping away at her balance thanks to 0% financing.\n\n\u201cThis works out for me for now, until they change it,\u201d she said.", "description": "Despite signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, New York-based Citigroup Inc is betting big on credit cards.", "authors": ["Imani Moise", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426878354&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850XL", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
