I want to play, I always give my best for the team.\n\n\u201cThe coach is the man who picks the team and when you\u2019re on the bench you\u2019re not happy, but I\u2019m trying to convince him to change his mind and pick me to play.\n\n\u201cThe season is long. As you saw I played (against Leicester) and we won. I\u2019m happy so we\u2019ll see in the future what the coach will decide.\u201d\n\nMatic, a fixture in United\u2019s midfield since his move from Chelsea in 2017, said the club\u2019s young players had deserved their chances under Solskjaer.\n\nApart from McTominay, United have given regular playing time to Marcus Rashford, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James, all of whom are 21.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in age, good players or bad players. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 18 or 35, so I think who played... deserved to play,\u201d Matic added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the young players, they get the opportunity to play. It\u2019s not always the case in big clubs... this season the people from the club, they can see who\u2019s ready to play already in a high level.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic is frustrated by his limited playing opportunities at the start of the Premier League campaign but will continue to fight for his place in the team.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430383541&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0J1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
