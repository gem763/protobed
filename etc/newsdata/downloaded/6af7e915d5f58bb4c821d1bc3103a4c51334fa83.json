I\u2019ve just been fired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports,\u201d tweeted Barry Petchesky.\n\nOn Wednesday, sports writer Lauren Theisen posted an image she said was of \u201cthe meeting where management tried to get us to move past Barry\u2019s firing.\u201d She then announced that she was leaving the site over how her colleagues were treated.\n\nFeatures writer Kelsey McKinney and media reporter Laura Wagner were also among the many staffers to announce they quit Wednesday.\n\nA G/O spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cThey resigned and we\u2019re sorry that they couldn\u2019t work within this incredibly broad coverage mandate. We\u2019re excited about Deadspin\u2019s future and we\u2019ll have some important updates in the coming days.\u201d\n\nThe union for G/O Media workers responded with a blunt statement: \u201cFrom the outset, CEO Jim Spanfeller has worked to undermine a successful site by curtailing its most well-read coverage because it makes him personally uncomfortable. This is not what journalism looks like and it is not what editorial independence looks like. ... In addition to being bad business, Spanfeller\u2019s actions are morally reprehensible. The GMG Union stands with our current and former Deadspin colleagues and condemns Jim Spanfeller in the strongest possible terms.\u201d\n\nThis report originally appeared on NYPost.com.", "description": "Several staffers at the news site announced their resignations on Wednesday \u2014 amid a struggle with their G/O Media bosses who recently issued a memo telling...", "authors": ["Tamar Lapin"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU271_deadsp_MG_20191029192750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
