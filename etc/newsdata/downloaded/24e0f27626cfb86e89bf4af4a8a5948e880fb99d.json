Early elections were called for April 9.\n\nNetanyahu was \u2014 and is again \u2014 facing Benny Gantz, a 60-year-old who served as the Israeli Army's Chief of Staff from 2011-2015, navigating the country through two incursions on the Gaza Strip, which earned him praise for his leadership.\n\nGantz leads the centrist Blue and White party, which was only formed this year.\n\nMany voters have voiced support for Gantz, who would undeniably bring change after Netanyahu's four terms and 13 years as prime minister. Netanyahu heads the right-wing Likud party.\n\nHe is the longest-serving leader in Israel's history. He has also been embroiled in several corruption scandals and may face criminal charges in the near future.\n\nBoth Netanyahu and Gantz won 35 seats in Israel's parliament, far short of the 61 needed for an outright majority (Israel's parliament \u2014 also called the Knesset \u2014 has 120 seats.)\n\nIf a party has no majority, the Israeli President \u2014 currently Reuven Rivlin \u2014 picks a prime minister based on who they consider most able to form a coalition. In April, Rivlin chose Netanyahu, who then failed to form a coalition government. The consequence was the September election.\n\nElection results put Netanyahu and Gantz neck-and-neck\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Wednesday in Israel, Gantz's Blue and White party was slightly ahead with 27.3% of the vote.\n\nNetanyahu's Likud party trailed with 26.9% of the vote, with 56% of the votes tallied. Third parties, soon to become strategic allies to the as-of-yet undetermined winner, held smaller yet significant portions of the vote.\n\nThough Israelis are reliving an experience they went through just months ago, voter turnout this election was higher than April's, up to 69.4% from 67.9%.\n\nRead more: Israel has been plunged into political chaos after Netanyahu failed to form a government \u2014 and experts say this could be the end of the line for him\n\nIf no party secures an outright majority, Rivlin will select his choice. After the president decides, the chosen candidate has 42 days to form a coalition government through negotiation with smaller parties.\n\nIf the selected leader can't form a coalition, another candidate will be given a chance.\n\nGantz on Wednesday night called for a \"good and desirable unity government,\" according to Haaretz, a reference to a possible joint rule between his party and Netanyahu's Likud.\n\nAvigdor Liberman, the leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party \u2060\u2014 a kingmaker in the last election\u2060\u2014 also called on both parties to join together in a \"broad liberal unity government.\"\n\nExperts say it's likely Netanyahu will be unseated \u2014 and Trump will lose a strategic Middle East ally\n\nExit polls suggest that Netanyahu's role as Israel's strongman may soon be coming to an end.\n\nYohanan Plesner, President of the Israel Democracy Institute, said in a press call on Tuesday that exits polls indicate a \"quite dramatic outcome.\"\n\n\"For the first time after a decade, there is a very high likelihood that Netanyahu is no longer going to be the Prime Minister of the State of Israel,\" he said.\n\nWhile it will be up to Rivlin to say which candidate will be tasked with forming a coalition, Plesner said Netanyahu's chances appear to be \"blocked,\" because Gantz has more potential coalition partners.\n\nPlesner added that Likud might decide to unseat Netanyahu as party leader, which could help their chances of forming a unity government.\n\n\"We might enter a period of days and perhaps weeks, when it is unclear who is going to be the Prime Minister,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu is a strategic ally to US President Donald Trump and has grown closer to him since his election in 2016.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the US has made several policy decisions favorable to Israel, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving its embassy there, withdrawing from the nuclear deal it signed with Israel's nemesis Iran, and calling for the recognition of Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.\n\nBut Plesner said that Trump's friendliness did less to boost Netanyahu in this election, because voters were used to it and any boost \"was already factored in.\"", "description": "Experts predict that this is the end of the line for Netanyahu, and say early results of this election indicate a \"quite dramatic outcome.\"", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d82011f2e22af6b7e5a71b3-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
