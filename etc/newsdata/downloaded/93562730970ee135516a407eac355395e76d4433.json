None at all.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true of gang members in our inner cities. Many of them have numerous convictions yet keep getting their hands on guns somehow. It\u2019s baffling. After all, there are already a plethora of gun laws on the books to prevent this very thing, right?\n\nWell, maybe we\u2019re wrong. Maybe gang members aren\u2019t carrying guns for real. After all, gun laws work, right?\n\nThe Cleveland Division of Police arrested three people as part of its investigation into the Blitz street gang. Imonte Sims, 25, Marcus Hopper, 23, and Toney Hope Jr., 28, were taken into custody for parole violations, weapons offenses and drug charges. Officers also seized several assault rifles and handguns, police said.\n\nOh.\n\nWell.\n\nThere went that idea, didn\u2019t it?\n\nThe truth of the matter is that this isn\u2019t surprising. These three men allegedly had illicit drugs and firearms despite criminal convictions. Between these three, apparently, there were something like 10 handguns, an AK pistol, and an AR-15 rifle. All this despite apparent felony convictions. It\u2019s kind of like that just didn\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cThis is why we need universal background checks,\u201d some nimrod will try and claim.\n\nNo. Sorry, that doesn\u2019t wash.\n\nNote that they also allegedly had drugs on hand as well. If you think they can\u2019t get guns through similar contacts to how they obtained drugs, you\u2019re literally too stupid to muster enough brainpower to breathe. The drugs are bought and sold on the black market, just like most guns obtained by criminals.\n\nI promise you, just like there wasn\u2019t a prescription asked for on the drugs, no background check was going to be performed on the guns.\n\nCriminals don\u2019t follow the rules. By definition, they don\u2019t. They do what they want, when they want, so long as they get something out of it. It could be a profit or their own personal amusement. It doesn\u2019t really matter to them, they just don\u2019t follow the law and won\u2019t unless it, also, serves their purposes.\n\nThat includes gun laws.\n\nIt\u2019s always included gun laws.\n\nThey\u2019ve continued to buy whatever they can get their grubby little paws on and bypass criminal background checks in the process. That includes handguns, rifles, shotguns, or whatever else they want. No law is going to stop them.\n\nThe sooner anti-gunners get it through their heads that this is what criminals do, the happier we can all be. Then we can start looking at \u201cgun crime\u201d as simply crime and start looking at ways to deal with that more effectively without having to deal with potential infringements to the civil liberties of ordinary, law-abiding, decent Americans.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about rocket science here. There\u2019s ample evidence showing that criminals aren\u2019t obtaining their guns through legal means. All it really takes is for someone to take a long, honest look at that evidence and they\u2019ll see it.\n\nOf course, asking anti-gunners to take an honest look at evidence that doesn\u2019t confirm their preconceived ideas might be a bit harder than it should be.", "description": "Since gun control works so well, there's absolutely no way these three individuals with felony convictions got their hands on numerous weapons.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
