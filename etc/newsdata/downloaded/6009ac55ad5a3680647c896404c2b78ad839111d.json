Why? As it\u2019s the much older brother, the ISM manufacturing PMI essentially rolled over and went into the fetal position.\n\nFears of a global slowdown were already weighing on sentiment ahead of ISM manufacturing sinking to a 10-year low until the dire number finally saw equity markets rollover from their highs. As we outlined previously, the service sector has remained in growth since the last recession in 2009 whilst manufacturing had sent two false recession signals over the same period. Therefore, we\u2019d prefer to see service PMI fall alongside manufacturing to assess the likelihood of a US recession better. And it appears the service sector is now closing the gap to the downside, although the numbers aren\u2019t all that bad.\n\nISM Non Manufacturing PMI Monthly Chart\n\nThere are a few worrying signs within the service sector, although it remains expansive none the less.\n\nThe service sector is expanding at its slowest rate in 3 years, at 52.6\n\nFalling 8.2 from its peak, it\u2019s the largest decline from its peak during the entire expansion . We\u2019d have to 2007 to see a fall from its high of a greater magnitude.\n\n. We\u2019d have to 2007 to see a fall from its high of a greater magnitude. September was a -2 standard deviation change . Whist technically the industry remains in growth territory, it has had quite a knock to the head.\n\n. Whist technically the industry remains in growth territory, it has had quite a knock to the head. Employment barely grew at 50.4 and is its slowest rate since 2013\n\nImports contracted for the first time since February\n\nNew orders and business activity/production fell -6.6 and -6.3 points respectively in September. However, they remain elevated at 53.7 and 55.2, and the monthly changes are quite volatile.\n\nISM Non Manufacturing PMI Monthly (Sub Indices)\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad. And, unlike the manufacturing sector, there are some good numbers within the sub-sectors:\n\nPrices are their highest in 10 months at 60 (inflationary)\n\nOnly imports declined, and new orders and business production remain expansive.\n\nThe backlog of orders sits just above its 1-year average at 54\n\nKey takeaway: It may not have been a great month for services by historical standards, but with new orders, business production, and the backlog of orders remaining expansive, it leaves the potential for a bounce. Particularly if the US and China sign that famous trade deal. Sure, if we see this move into contraction, then the probability of a US recession goes up, but we\u2019d prefer to see if there are signs of weakness in new orders, production, and a backlog of orders next month before calling Armageddon for the financial markets.\n\nStill, traders have increased the probability of a Fed rate cut this month to 86% from 77% the day before. We think it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll pull the trigger on a 50- bps cut simply because they\u2019re easing from the lowest peak in history, and they\u2019d prefer to leave such a move for if or when the markets are truly in turmoil.\n\nS&P 500 Index Daily Chart\n\nThe S&P500 recovered as it headed into the end of the session and trades back above 2,900. An initial sell-off threatened a break of its June trendline until the 200-day EMA saved the day. A 2-day reversal pattern in the form of a bullish piercing line suggests the initial breakdown could have been a bear-trap, but we also have the 50-day MA as a likely resistance level. Furthermore, yesterday\u2019s bullish candle needs to be taken in the context of the initial decline, so bulls may not yet be out of the woods just yet.\n\nUnless we see prices rebound sharply, bears could consider fading into low volatility moves below the 2,950 (prior support) or wait for a lower high to form beneath the key level.\n\nHowever, if we see a sharp rebound, then bulls could assume the low is in and target the all-time highs once more.\n\nHigher expectations of a rate cut are supportive of stocks, so a weak Nonfarm payroll report could throw bulls another lifeline. Conversely, a strong employment report could cap gains.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
