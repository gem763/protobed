Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) drew a sharp reaction from Donald Trump on Tuesday after he said the president\u2019s \u201cmeasured response\u201d to Iran\u2019s downing of a U.S. military drone in June had been interpreted by the Iranian regime as a \u201csign of weakness.\u201d\n\nGraham, one of the president\u2019s most vocal supporters, appeared to suggest in a Twitter thread that Trump\u2019s decision to call off a retaliatory military strike on Iran had emboldened its leaders, who he suggested were involved in drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities over the weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, Graham advocated for the U.S. to consider attacks on Iranian refineries in response.\n\nA great briefing by @VP Pence to the Senate Republican Conference regarding the attack on Saudi oil facilities.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s clear to me that such a sophisticated attack could not have occurred without Iran\u2019s blessing and direct involvement. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nThis is literally an act of war and the goal should be to restore deterrence against Iranian aggression which has clearly been lost. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nI applaud the Administration\u2019s efforts to create a regional coalition, thoroughly brief the Congress on the actions taken, and come up with a plan of action to restore deterrence against an evil regime in Iran. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nThe measured response by President @realDonaldTrump regarding the shooting down of an American drone was clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nThe problems with Iran only get worse over time so it is imperative we take decisive action to deter further aggression by the Ayatollah and his henchman. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nTrump, however, hit back on Twitter. \u201cNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand!\u201d he wrote.\n\nNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand! https://t.co/EU8AvfH7j9 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s snarky tweet predictably set the social media platform alight, given the president\u2019s cozy relationship with Graham since Trump took office:\n\nSooo needy. Sooo thirsty.
