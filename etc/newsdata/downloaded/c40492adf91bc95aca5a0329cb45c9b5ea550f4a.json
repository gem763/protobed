Donald Trump has chosen to promote from within for his new national security adviser and to let Pompeo run things from his perch at State. Trump made the announcement on Twitter, natch:\n\nI am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O\u2019Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor. I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nRobert O\u2019Brien had landed on observers\u2019 short lists for likely candidates to replace John Bolton, who left the national security adviser position last week. It\u2019s a solid choice in that sense, one of continuity rather than a \u201cteam of rivals\u201d pick as Bolton arguably was. He has a lengthy track record of service in the diplomatic arena, having worked under Bolton at the UN during the Bush administration but also with Secretaries Susan Rice and Hillary Clinton during the Obama administration. In this administration, he\u2019s mostly known for his A$AP Rocky shuttle diplomacy, but O\u2019Brien has much more substance than that.\n\nThat expertise will no doubt make Capitol Hill more comfortable with the direction of foreign policy under Trump. One has to wonder how it will play with both the MAGA non-interventionists and the GOP\u2019s still-significant Bolton-friendly crowd, however. This looks more like a middle-of-the-road establishment pick than the kind of out-of-the-box thinking both sides wanted from Trump (in very different ways, of course). O\u2019Brien might be cut from the same mold as Bolton, but one would suspect he wouldn\u2019t have lasted long with the Obama administration if he was. He\u2019s certainly not going to bring a Rand Paul approach, either.\n\nIt also seems at first blush to be an extension of Pompeo\u2019s influence rather than an expression of Trump\u2019s own vision. O\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t have the resum\u00e9 of someone bringing in his own constituency to the job in the way that Bolton did, or for that matter H.R. McMaster did. While O\u2019Brien has a significant track record at State, he\u2019s not been setting policy there. If this is an extension of Pompeo\u2019s authority, then perhaps O\u2019Brien is meant to be a conduit for Kellyanne Conway\u2019s suggestion that Pompeo fill both roles. This might be the next best thing.\n\nAt any rate, O\u2019Brien will need to hit the ground running on his newly expanded portfolio. Trump has to decide between the Boltonist and Paulist options with Iran after the bombing of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure. For now, Trump is taking the more cautious route of expanding sanctions:\n\nI have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nCBS News national security correspondent David Martin said the most urgent order of business for Pompeo will be to discuss the installation of better air defenses around the Saudis\u2019 oil facilities, which have suddenly proven vulnerable to attack. U.S. intelligence agencies were caught flatfooted, never expecting Iran would be so bold as to attack Saudi Arabia directly. A U.S. official told CBS News the U.S. has identified the exact locations in southern Iran from which the drones and cruise missiles were launched at Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear what form that expansion will have, nor whether this is the extent of the public US response. Equally unclear, at least for now, is what influence O\u2019Brien will really have on the answers to those questions.\n\nUpdate: Added \u201cbreaking\u201d tag, since this is legit breaking news.", "description": "\"I have worked long & hard with Robert.
