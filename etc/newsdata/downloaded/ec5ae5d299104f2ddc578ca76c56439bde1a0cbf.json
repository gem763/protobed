Phillips \u2014 the former chairman of the board of directors of Postmedia Network Canada Corp., which owns the Financial Post \u2014 has said the coming fiscal update would show the Ford government is on track to beat its previous 2019-20 deficit projection of $10.3 billion. The Ontario Tories are aiming for a balanced budget by 2023-24, after the next provincial election.\n\nOntario\u2019s PCs have, however, been accused by rivals of understating the province\u2019s financial position, with recent public accounts showing the 2018-19 deficit was $7.4 billion, about half the $15-billion shortfall they once estimated.\n\nPhillips said that while in New York he also met with investors, including some in the private-equity industry, about the possibility of bringing jobs and investment to Ontario.\n\nThe finance minister\u2019s remarks came a day after it was announced that the provincially-owned Ontario Cannabis Store will consult with marijuana producers and retailers on possible ways to increase their participation in delivering pot to stores.\n\nPhillips said their government is still intending to move towards a more \u201cmarket-based\u201d system for cannabis in Ontario.\n\n\u201cWhat that means and what the Cannabis Store is out consulting on right now is looking at the creative ways that we can take advantage of \u2026 how that supply chain works, how we can effectively make sure that the government is playing its role, but not overplaying its role, in terms of the system going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nOntario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, has had a relatively slow roll-out of privately-owned cannabis stores that the government blamed on supply shortages. A change in retail direction from government-owned to private by the PCs also helped contribute to a $42-million loss the province\u2019s cannabis company reported for its fiscal year ended March 31.\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "Possibly standing in the way of any big tax cuts is Ontario's net debt, forecast to hit $360 billion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/rod-phillips.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
