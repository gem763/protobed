REUTERS/Moe Doiron/File Photo\n\nFreeland previously came out strongly against Waseem Ramli\u2019s appointment to the position of Syrian honorary consul and promised timely action, but she had first wanted to hear Global Affairs Canada\u2019s explanation for approving the position.\n\n\u201cUpon review of the department\u2019s decision, I have instructed officials to immediately revoke his status,\u201d she said.\n\nCanada joined several other countries in ejecting all Syrian diplomats after the 2012 Houla massacre, but Syria has maintained honorary consul positions in Montreal and Vancouver to \u201cprovide basic consular services to Syrians in Canada,\u201d Freeland said.\n\nHowever Ramli\u2019s appointment to the position caused fear in the Syrian refugee community living in Canada, according to activists, and shocked Freeland, who said she and her staff were not informed of Ramli\u2019s approval by Global Affairs Canada.\n\nRamli posts frequently on Facebook in support of Assad, and told Canada\u2019s Maclean\u2019s magazine that the White Helmets, a group of volunteer first-responders in Syria, are a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d linked to al Qaeda.\n\nRamli could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cNo one who shares Mr. Ramli\u2019s views should have ever been approved by Global Affairs Canada,\u201d Freeland said in her statement.\n\nHer announcement is a \u201cbig relief\u201d for the Syrian community, Bayan Khatib, a Syrian-Canadian in Toronto, told Reuters, adding the community is happy the Canadian government has responded with \u201cappropriate action.\u201d\n\nShe also expressed satisfaction that Freeland said she will initiate a review of how appointments are processed.\n\n\u201cThe point for me is not about sides,\u201d Khatib said. \u201cIt\u2019s about having someone that ... is neutral and isn\u2019t blatantly making people uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nCanada accepted 58,650 Syrian refugees between 2015 and 2018 through both government and private citizen sponsorship, according to the most recent government statistics.\n\n(The story corrects status of Bayan Khatib to Syrian-Canadian instead of Syrian refugee in Canada, paragraph 9)", "description": "Canada has revoked its approval of a diplomat in Montreal who is a supporter of Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433829377&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1MF-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
