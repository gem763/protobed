The sector I call proptech is growing fast. Like all tech sectors it has its challenges. But it will have an increasing impact on traditional real estate.\n\nEY\u2019s Global Real Estate, Hospitality & Construction Leader, Mark Grinis, released a report, Venture Capital Funding Points to the Hottest Concepts in Built-World Tech, to the 2000 attendees at the CREtech New York conference last week.\n\n\u201cFor real estate companies to compete in a new era where power has shifted to tenants and residents, embracing technology must be the cornerstone of their business strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nLuckily not all proptech is disruptive.\n\n\u201cBuilt-world tech has evolved with start-ups focused on solutions that can solve real estate owners' and operators' challenges, complementing rather than redefining their businesses,\u201d said Grinis.\n\n\u201cThese start-ups are increasingly focused on cost saving and profitability, which will enhance the return on investment for real estate owners.\u201d\n\nAustralia's place\n\nAustralia has 265 companies playing in the proptech space \u2013 a 428 per cent increase since 2013, according to the global proptech tracker Unissu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese companies are seeing value in the industry and needs that are not being met,\u201d says EY\u2019s managing partner for Oceania real estate, Selina Short.\n\n\u201cSome of Australia\u2019s largest developers have launched proptech accelerators, incubators or innovation labs, and it\u2019s no surprise that proptech investment in Australia is predicted to reach $20 billion in 2020.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, SmartCompany nominated seven Australian proptech start-ups which had \u201craised millions,\u201d including Soho, which offers a new way of linking real estate agents, owners, buyers and renters; ActivePipe, which helps identify real estate clients, LocalAgentFinder which empowers homeowners in the search for an agent; BrickX for property investment, HappyCo for management software; Athena for home loans; and MadeComfy for the management of short-term stays.\n\nCharter Hall, which last year ran a proptech accelerator program, divides the new technologies into three categories: one that creates smarter buildings; a second that uses space more efficiently; and a third that smooths the interaction between finance and real estate.\n\nTaronga Group, founded to invest in real estate innovation and technology, has a RealTechx Growth Program, that's focused on start-ups in energy, sustainability, safety and wellness.\n\nEY\u2019s Short acknowledges the huge expectations for proptech as a \u201cpanacea\u201d for all problems.\n\nBiggest hurdle\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe biggest hurdle ahead is scalability,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to introduce a smart system into a shiny new building \u2013 quite another to roll it out across an entire portfolio of existing stock.\u201d\n\nMany other solutions, she notes, only address \u201ca small slice of the pie\u201d.\n\nThe key challenge, she says, is \u201cwhether we are investing in the cultural change and new skill sets required to ensure this clever tech actually creates better outcomes for people and, ultimately, stickier tenants. That\u2019s the big question.\u201d\n\nGrinis also notes three challenges. One is the level of infrastructure and talent; the second is the absence of single-source solutions; the third is the inability to deliver owners a solid return on investment.\n\nOf course, not all of proptech start-ups will work. Some will fall foul of the backlash against big data. Many will fall short of their proponents' ambition.\n\nWeWork woes\n\nThe latest SoftBank rescue package for WeWork values the group at around $US8 billion, not the $40 billion discussed just months ago, and the rescue will be painful to building owners and developers, including those in Australia.\n\nOne Seattle developer, who pre-committed his entire 36-storey project to WeWork in 2017, has, just months before completion, announced that WeWork will no longer be moving in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond its too-fast growth, WeWork is exposed to a reversal in office market demand because, as many realised in the lead-up to the float, the model is essentially an arbitrage. WeWork takes bulk space on long-term leases, cuts the space up, and offers it to customers on higher-priced short-term agreements.\n\nIf demand drops for its suites and desks, WeWork could be squeezed between falling revenue from short-term occupants and fixed long-term lease costs, some $US47 billion of them. The group would not be the first in real estate to be trapped by a mismatch in timing between assets and liabilities.\n\nHere to stay\n\nBut as I wrote last month, even if WeWork does not survive, the flexible-space model that WeWork promotes is here to stay.\n\nGlobal commercial real estate group CBRE has a similar view in a just-published report from its head of occupier research in the Americas, Julie Whelan.\n\n\u201cThis segment of space would not have skyrocketed to where it is today if occupier demand were not fuelling it,\u201d she writes.\n\n\u201cThe flexible-space model may shift from where we are today, but the fundamentals of speed, flexibility and low capital outlay will remain staples of occupancy decisions.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, one of the most canny real estate investors in the US, Barry Sternlicht\u2019s Starwood Capital, is reported to have provided part of the rescue funding for WeWork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report makes sense. Like many, Sternlicht would have seen the value in flexible office space and now has a seat at the table in the sector\u2019s biggest play.\n\nOf course in true tech culture, the failures only encourage the rest.\n\n\u201cWe expect a number of break-out companies to emerge in 2020, including venture capitalists interested in seizing new opportunities,\u201d Grinis said.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we can expect funding rounds to increase along with deal sizes.\u201d", "description": "The money going into property technology firms is equivalent to nearly 80 per cent of that invested in traditional secondary raisings for listed property, writes Robert Harley.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_277%2C$y_334/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/34f5ef196eea10343f45b8cdccfcc74a67200d7b", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
