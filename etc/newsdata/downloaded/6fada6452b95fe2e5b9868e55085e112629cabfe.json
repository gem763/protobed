(AP) - What a week for Chris Bassitt.\n\nTwo days after the birth of his first child, the Oakland right-hander shook off a rusty start and set a career-high for strikeouts. Bassitt also played a key role in a rare 6-1-4 double play that helped get the Athletics rolling.\n\nAnother big day from Oakland\u2019s offense helped, too.\n\nBassitt struck out 11 in six innings for his 10th win, helping the A\u2019s beat the Detroit Tigers 10-2 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cA lot of times he gets better as he goes along,\u201d manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cHe has the ability to be a little bit effecitively wild where one\u2019s up and in and then ones down and away and then one\u2019s paint. All that kind of works for him. When he\u2019s not giving free passes it makes it a lot easier on him.\u201d\n\nMatt Chapman hit his 32nd home run, Matt Olson had four hits including his 29th homer, and Jurickson Profar hit his 20th for Oakland, which remained one game behind Tampa Bay for the top AL wild card. The A\u2019s moved 1\u00bd games ahead of Cleveland for the second spot.\n\nPitching on eight days rest, Bassitt (10-5) allowed two runs and eight hits and didn\u2019t walk a batter for the fifth time this season. He was pitching two days after the birth of his daughter. The 11 strikeouts are the most by an A\u2019s pitcher this season.\n\n\u201cPretty much didn\u2019t sleep for three days,\u201d Bassitt said. \u201cThen I got here and was a zombie for a day. Yesterday felt pretty good and today I felt pretty good. The first two innings were just awful. My off speed was not there. I basically told (catcher Sean Murphy), \u2018Just stay with me, I\u2019ll get through it.\u201d\n\nAfter giving up hits to two of Detroit\u2019s first three batters, Bassitt induced a strange double play.\n\nChristin Stewart hit a high pop-up into foul territory that A\u2019s third baseman Matt Chapman chased before the ball came back fair and dropped on the infield dirt. Shortstop Marcus Semien grabbed the ball and threw to Bassitt who alertly covered third for the force out. The pitcher then threw to second to get Miguel Cabrera, who had stopped running while the ball was in the air.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know where the ball was going,\u201d Bassitt said. \u201cThe wind was weird tonight. I don\u2019t know in the history of baseball (that\u2019s) ever been done.\u201d\n\nHarold Castro matched his career high with four hits and had two RBIs for Detroit. The Tigers struck out 19 times.\n\n\u201cWe were really swinging wildly tonight,\u201d Detroit manager Ron Gardenhire said. \u201cWe miss a few plays and these guys absolutely kill you.\u201d\n\nOne day after blowing a four-run lead in a 5-4 loss that snapped a 16-game winning streak against the Tigers, the A\u2019s fell behind 2-0 then rallied against Jordan Zimmermann (1-10).\n\nProfar homered off Zimmermann in the second, becoming the sixth A\u2019s player this season with at least 20 home runs - a franchise record.\n\nOlson singled leading off the fourth to spark a four-run inning then hit a solo home run to right off Zimmermann in the fifth. Oakland\u2019s Gold Glove first baseman added a two-run single off Matt Hall in the sixth to make it 9-2.\n\nChapman homered in the eighth.\n\nZimmermann allowed six runs on seven hits in five innings.\n\nHOME RUN RECORD\n\nChapman\u2019s home run ties the A\u2019s record for third baseman set by Eric Chavez in 2001.\n\nTHREE TIMES 10\n\nBassitt became the third A\u2019s pitcher to win 10 or more games this season, joining Mike Fiers (14) and Brett Anderson (11). It\u2019s the first time since 2013 that Oakland has had three 10-game winners. Homer Bailey has 12 wins but only five have come since he was traded from Kansas City to the A\u2019s.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAthetics: One day after coming off the injured list, Ramon Laureano was forced out of the game with a right leg cramp after doubling leading off the sixth. Laureano missed more than a month with a right lower leg stress reaction. . Yusmeiro Petit has rejoined the team after missing the past few days following the death of his father. A moment of silence was held in honor of Petit\u2019s father before the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOakland\u2019s Sean Manaea (0-0, 0.00 ERA) makes his second start of the season against Detroit\u2019s Daniel Norris (3-11, 4.76) on Sunday in a matchup of lefties. Manaea missed the first five months of the season recovering from shoulder surgery, then threw five scoreless innings against the Yankees in his 2019 debut. Norris lost to the A\u2019s in May and is winless in two career starts against Oakland.\n\n__\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/tag/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "What a week for Chris Bassitt.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Wagaman"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/tigers_athletics_baseball_37208_c0-231-2438-1652_s1770x1032.jpg?c7f8be10172ecbed3a1510caf30fa4d8258a61ca", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
