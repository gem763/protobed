Fiona Hill, who served as the top Russia and Eastern European expert for the National Security Council, told House investigators on Monday that National Security Advisor John Bolton urged her to speak with a NSC lawyer about the pressure campaign after she learned of it. \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal [Gordon] Sondland and [Mick] Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton reportedly exclaimed to her. \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d he also reportedly said.\n\nSondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified before House investigators on Thursday. He offered details about his conversations with Trump and Giuliani that point towards an effort to coerce Ukraine into investigating Trump\u2019s political rivals. \u201c[Sondland and other diplomats] asked the White House to arrange a working phone call from President Trump and a working Oval Office visit,\u201d he said in his opening statement, referring to a briefing he gave Trump on May 23. \u201cHowever, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns. It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nWhen Sondland called Giuliani later that day, the president\u2019s legal fixer made clear what Trump wanted. \u201cIn these short conversations, Mr. Giuliani emphasized that the President wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing Ukraine to look into anti-corruption issues,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cMr. Giuliani specifically mentioned the 2016 election (including the DNC server) and Burisma as two anti-corruption investigatory topics of importance for the President.\u201d Burisma is the Ukrainian company on whose board Hunter Biden served; the purported DNC server is part of a bizarre conspiracy theory that blames Clinton and Ukraine for Russia\u2019s election interference in 2016.\n\nTrump and his allies have claimed there was no quid pro quo involved, and that if there were, it\u2019s just a normal component of foreign relations. Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, imploded the first claim on Thursday. \u201cSo the demand for an investigation into the Democrats was part of the reason that he ordered to withhold funding to Ukraine?\u201d a reporter asked him during a press conference. \u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation, and that is absolutely appropriate,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cWithholding the funding?\u201d came the follow-up. \u201cYeah, which ultimately then flowed,\u201d Mulvaney replied. He reiterated the claim shortly thereafter. \u201cBut to be clear, what you just described is a quid pro quo. It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well,\u201d a reporter told him. \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney replied. \u201cWe were holding up money at the same time for, what was it, the Northern Triangle countries [in Central America]. We were holding up aid at the Northern Triangle countries so that they would change their policies on immigration.\u201d", "description": "The one constant thread in this week's chaos storm of news is that every effort to defend the president only makes things worse for him.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/91a7fa7c7fd36574c0d98c528ec4a4317852eb62.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
