I don't listen to any of that.\"\n\nHowever, James said she believes the U.K.'s National Health Service should have done more. She told the program's hosts that doctors \"could have saved\" her son's sight if they had realized he had a vitamin A deficiency \u2014 one of the many nutritional issues that led to his blindness.\n\n\"If they'd done the blood test then and realized [his] vitamin A was so low, they could have given him the vitamin A injections then,\" James said.\n\nJames added that doctors gave Dyer nutrition shakes and other health products to try, but he refused to stick with them.\n\nDyer, who is considered completely blind in his left eye and mostly blind in his right eye, was the subject of a study in the American journal Annals of Internal Medicine earlier this month. In it, researchers detailed the teenager's diet, which for years consisted almost entirely of Pringles, chocolate candy, french fries and fried, processed meats.\n\n\"His diet was essentially a portion of chips from the local fish and chip [french fry] shop every day,\" Dr. Denize Atan, one of the teen's doctors, told the Telegraph. \"He also used to snack on crisps [potato chips] \u2014 Pringles \u2014 and sometimes slices of white bread and occasional slices of ham, and not really any fruit and vegetables.\"\n\nDyer's symptoms began around age 14, and by 17 he was deemed legally blind in addition to suffering from hearing loss and weakness in his bones. His condition, called nutritional optic neuropathy, is almost nonexistent in developed countries such as the U.K.\n\nThe 18-year-old also suffers from a rare eating disorder called avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, which likely contributed to his pickiness early in life. The disease makes it difficult for people to stomach certain foods based on sensory traits, such as smell, texture or flavor.\n\nJames said her son has shown symptoms of the eating disorder since he was 2 years old.\n\n\"He would psychically be sick,\" she said. \"He'd gag \u2014 he would choke if you tried to get it in him. It was awful. He would sweat, he was crying and screaming. It was just awful.\"\n\nUrusula Philpot, a dietician who appeared on ITV with the family, agreed that doctors had ignored certain aspects of Dyer's case. She said he should have been given vitamins via injections, as his eating disorder made swallowing certain foods very difficult.\n\nPhilpot said that Dyer and his family suffered from an experience that \"shouldn't have happened.\"", "description": "The mother of a British\u00a0teen who went legally blind after eating a junk food-based diet says she blames her\u00a0country's healthcare system.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/duxIXloSaVDfvvdF7LjiHg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/367x241+28+34/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/59a952c0-da3d-11e9-9f39-02ebdb97816f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
