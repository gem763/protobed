Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk\u2019s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative.\n\nThe following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Price Indicator is Most Bearish Since December\n\nLast week, the Federal Reserve injected $278 billion into the securities repurchase, or \u201crepo,\u201d market over four days, all so that banks could meet their liquidity needs. It was the first time the Fed had intervened in this vital interbank market, where banks\u2019 pawn financial assets to fund overnight cash needs, since the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nFed officials and bankers dismissed the rare liquidity breakdown as a hiccup stemming from a series of coincidental factors in bond markets and corporate tax payments. It wasn\u2019t a very comforting explanation, not when other economic warning signs are flashing, too: $17 trillion in bonds worldwide showing negative yields; a worsening U.S.-China trade war; and manufacturing indicators signaling an impending global recession.\n\nPredictably, certain crypto types have viewed this alarming scenario with glee. More than a few HODLing tweeters responded to the repo story with two words of advice: \u201cbuy bitcoin.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s actually hard to predict what all this means for crypto markets, at least in the short- to medium-term.\n\nRelated: Bakkt Exchange\u2019s Bitcoin Futures See Slow Start on First Day of Trading\n\nIf and when a 2008-like financial panic takes hold, will bitcoin rally as a new kind of uncorrelated \u201csafe haven\u201d or will it decline in a broad-based \u201crisk-off\u201d dumping of all things speculative? (Notwithstanding a sharp dip and rebound midway through last week, bitcoin has proven quite stable of late, at least by its own volatile standards.)\n\nOther questions: do these vulnerabilities in traditional credit markets highlight the promise of new blockchain-based ideas? For example, would wider use of security tokens allow speedier settlement and, by extension, reduced counterparty risks and greater market confidence? Or, far more radically, would MakerDAO\u2019s on-chain #DeFi lending markets enable a more reliable clearing mechanism, with collateral calls locked in by a decentralized protocol? Or might these underdeveloped ideas simply be recipes for systemic risk, a single hack or software glitch away from setting off a vicious spiral of collateral calls and bankruptcies?\n\nThe jury is out on all this untested stuff.\n\nStill, if nothing else, the many signs of stress in the traditional financial system offer a valuable framework for thinking about how the world could be different and the role blockchain technology might play in enabling that new world.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of them:\n\nNegative-yields\n\nThe rare phenomenon, where creditors are essentially paying issuers for the privilege of lending them money \u2013 head scratcher, right? \u2013 reflects excessive demand for \u201csafe\u201d assets, especially for government-issued bonds. It has historically been a strong indicator of impending recession, since it reflects an overwhelming reluctance among investors to take on risk.\n\nNow, another way of thinking about that reluctance is to express it as a perceived shortage of good investment opportunities. That perception can be fueled by a worsening economic outlook, but it\u2019s also dictated by the barriers to entry that make it difficult for otherwise investable businesses of offer new opportunities.\n\nHere, certain blockchain-based credit ideas offer hope. There\u2019s the prospect for distributed-ledger asset registries that better track collateral and enable new emerging-market lending in developing-country land, commodities and energy markets. Or there are ideas such as having exporters tokenize their receivables to tackle a major structural limit on global trade finance, where a majority of small-and-medium enterprise are denied letters of credit because bankers don\u2019t trust their documentation.\n\nEffective use of blockchain technology could boost trust in assets and lien registries and help bring to life the $20 trillion in \u201cdead capital\u201d that economist Hernando de Soto says the world\u2019s poor are sitting on.\n\nJust as importantly, it would open a world of new alternative assets to draw in investors\u2019 capital, giving them less of a reason to park it in low-yielding bonds.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Fed Reserve has injected $278 billion injection into the securities repurchase market.
