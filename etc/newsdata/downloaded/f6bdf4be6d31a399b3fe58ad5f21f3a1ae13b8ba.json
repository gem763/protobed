They were still calling her \u2018Trout Pout\u2019 back then, now they\u2019re all celebrating her bachelorette together! It\u2019s a testament to how much these characters and their relationships have developed over the course of the series. (I mean, season one Diana in any sort of balloon headwear is just unimaginable.) Look how far we\u2019ve come\u2026 on everything except this whole Josh-Liza-Charles situation. Yes, I am still ranting against This! Freaking! Love Triangle! Unfortunately, my ranting will do no good since in \u201cHolding Out For a SHero\u201d the triangle goes from just simmering in the background to full on \u201cwe\u2019re really doing this again.\u201d You guys, we\u2019re really doing this again.\n\nWhen Liza informs Maggie of her plan to cut Josh out of her life, Maggie is dubious. But Liza is insistent that she is choosing Charles. He\u2019s her peer, she says! He\u2019s age appropriate, she says! It just feels right. Honestly, anyone who\u2019s been alive for more than five minutes knows that if being \u201cage appropriate\u201d is one of your top reasons for staying in a relationship, you\u2019re in trouble. Remember when Liza and Charles were so steamy kissing on library steps and riding seashell carousels and cooking pasta together? What has this show done to you two?!\n\nAfter meeting with the author of a Millennial Etiquette Guidebook, Liza decides that she doesn\u2019t want to just ghost Josh, so decides to write a Dear John letter instead. He changed her life, but she needs to let him go, she writes. And then she wastes a whole gosh dang stamp to put it in the mail instead of just slipping it under his front door. Get it together, Liza! She mails it one night and then he gets it the very next day and reads it while in middle of demo on his Infinitely 21 branch of Inkburg because yes, that has already started and honestly, what is time on this show?\n\nObviously, he does not take it well. Immediately, he takes the letter outside for a nice brooding sesh that includes a very sweet montage of some Josh-Liza moments throughout the six seasons. WE GET IT. They were very good together. This would be a lovely and appropriate goodbye highlight reel if we were truly moving past this relationship. But we are not. No, when Josh and Liza run into each other during Diana\u2019s bachelorette party, he calls her out on her bullshit. Well, first, she walks by him silently when everyone else in their group has said hello, creating one of the most awkward moments in Younger history, and hello, this is a show in which Liza had to pull a menstrual cup out of Kelsey.\n\nLiza and Josh have it out on the street. She tells him this is just as hard for her, but she has to give her relationship a shot. He doesn\u2019t believe that she loves Charles more than she loves him. When she says she does, he tells her he can always tell when she\u2019s lying, which is rich coming from a dude who believed she was 26 for an incredibly long period of time. To Josh\u2019s point though, it is pretty convincing. \u201cYou wrote a letter to the wrong guy,\u201d he says, walking away. Reader, I gasped. Reader, I felt things in that moment that might call my membership on Team Charles into question. I should be on probation, at least. READER. It was so intense and charged with emotion and Josh isn\u2019t going anywhere any time soon.\n\nLiza isn\u2019t the only important woman in Charles\u2019s life who is questioning her relationship with him. Kelsey is officially out as publisher and although she\u2019s putting on a brave face, she\u2019s completely gutted. Her meme is alive and well \u2014 it\u2019s even been remixed \u2014 and no matter how many times Liza and Lauren tell her she\u2019s a \u201cgoddamn hero\u201d or \u201cshero,\u201d for putting her company first and making sure everyone employed by Millennial stays employed, people in the industry are distancing themselves from her. She finally takes Lauren\u2019s suggestion to accept an invitation to speak at an all-girls high school about her experience. She tells the girls that more than anything, she\u2019s angry. And she has reason to be! It quickly becomes clear that with Charles reinstated as publisher, he and Zane are going to push through some books that Kelsey had nixed. Everything she did for the company is being erased.\n\nOn top of being demoted and humiliated, she has to watch as Zane seems to enjoy announcing the new slate of Charles and Zane\u2013approved books. He says he feels guilty about what happened since he was the intended recipient of the video, but he doesn\u2019t act guilty. Kelsey ends things, realizing that whenever they try to be together for real, one of them gets hurt. \u201cWe\u2019re cursed!\u201d she says, like they\u2019re regular ol\u2019 Mary and Matthew Crawleys. Zane, don\u2019t go speeding around in your car after the happiest moment of your life, okay?\n\nKelsey\u2019s heartbroken on all accounts. She\u2019s lost Zane and she doesn\u2019t have any idea when she\u2019ll ever enjoy walking back into the office. There\u2019s a dark pall on everything. So, in the end, Kelsey writes her own letter. She tells Charles that she needs to move on from Millennial and Empirical for good. Honestly, it\u2019s about time.\n\nIt\u2019s Trout Season\n\n\u2022 Honestly, I thought a Trout Bachelorette deserved to be an A-storyline, but I guess that Diana Trout saying the line, \u201cLadies, there are bulging crotches in your faces, can you focus?\u201d almost makes up for the festivities being sidelined. Also, we got a scene in which Maggie teaches Diana how strip clubs work, so that was nice.\n\n\u2022 When drunk Diana shows up at Inkburg for a tattoo (mercifully, Josh, a true gentleman, turns them away), she asks for something \u201csmall, tasteful, literary.\u201d I\u2019d like to hear your best suggestions for a tattoo worthy of the Trout in the comments! We all know her internet password is \u201cMiddlemarch,\u201d so something along those lines, please.\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m still laughing at Lauren screaming \u201cget in the hummer, bitch!\u201d in Diana\u2019s face. What a pair, those two!\n\n\u2022 \u201cDo millennials even know how to hold pens?\u201d", "description": "Diana\u2019s bachelorette underlines just how far Younger has come\u2026 on everything except this whole Josh-Liza-Charles situation.
