Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since 2016, but his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is more impressive than either rookie backup Devlin Hodges or Paxton Lynch, the club's newest addition to the practice squad.\n\n\"Hey guys, I went through the process that we went through in terms of our decision making,\" Tomlin said during a press conference Monday. \"We went with Hodges because he's been a significant component of our offseason and training camp; and for short term fluidity, we thought that was the best.\n\n\"And we acquired Paxton Lynch because he is practice squad eligible and we can bring him up to speed and evaluate him without utilizing a roster spot. I'm not talking openly about free agents that aren't on our roster. That conversation could go on for days and be endless. There's a number of people at the quarterback position and others that are unemployed in today's NFL. I'm not going to use this forum to do that.\"\n\n[RELATED: Why Steelers need to do what's right: sign Colin Kaepernick]\n\nKaepernick has been the center of a national controversy since he chose to kneel during the playing of the national anthem during the 2016 season as a way to protest racial inequality.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn February, the NFL reached settlements with Kaepernick and former 49ers safety Eric Reid on their collusion grievances.
