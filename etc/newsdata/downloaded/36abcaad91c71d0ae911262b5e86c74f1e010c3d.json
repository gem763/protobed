To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,\" the prince said in the statement posted on the couple's royal website.\n\nA Mail on Sunday spokesperson told Britain's Press Association the paper 'stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.' (Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face \u2014 as so many of you can relate to \u2014 I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,\" Harry said.\n\nA Mail on Sunday spokesperson told Britain's Press Association the paper \"stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously.\n\n\"Specifically, we categorically deny that the duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.\"\n\nHarry has criticized British celebrity news coverage before. He lashed out at aggressive paparazzi that stalked Meghan's every move when they were dating and offensive treatment of her biracial heritage by some media.\n\nIn Tuesday's statement, he mentioned his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in an August 1997 car crash while being pursued by paparazzi, as the reason he knew the move to take a tabloid to court \"may not be the safe one, it is the right one.\n\n\"Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,\" he said. \"I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, arrive for an engagement during an official visit on Oct. 3, 2018 in Chichester, England.

The news agency said if damages are awarded to Meghan, they will be donated to a charity that combats bullying.\n\nThe lawsuit also names the Mail on Sunday's parent company, Associated Newspapers.\n\nHarry said the couple and their baby son, Archie, have received positive news coverage during their royal tour in southern Africa that demonstrated how Meghan has been subjected to press \"bullying\" back home.\n\n\"She is the same woman she was a year ago on our wedding day, just as she is the same woman you've seen on this Africa tour.\"", "description": "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has sued a U.K. tabloid newspaper that she claims illegally published a personal letter she wrote to her father.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305306.1569975355!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/south-africa-royals-visit.jpg"}
