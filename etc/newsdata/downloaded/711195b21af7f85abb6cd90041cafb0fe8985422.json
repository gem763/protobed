REUTERS/Mark Makela\n\nDe Blasio, 58, launched his candidacy in May with the central campaign message \u201cWorking People First,\u201d becoming the 24th Democrat to attempt to take on President Donald Trump in next year\u2019s election.\n\nThe mayor, who is barred from seeking a third four-year term in New York in 2021, struggled to build a national profile and stand out in a crowded field that includes former Vice President Joe Biden and a long list of experienced politicians.\n\nNews of the mayor ending his presidential bid was greeted with sarcasm by Trump.\n\n\u201cOh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years! Part time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race,\u201d Trump tweeted early on Friday. \u201cNYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home!\u201d\n\nDe Blasio had registered little support in polls and was eclipsed by progressive U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nDe Blasio said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that a \u201ccentral reason\u201d for his decision was the party\u2019s rules for qualifying for televised debates. He had failed to qualify for a Sept. 12 debate that featured the 10 leading candidates for the party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u201cThe bar is so high so early that for a lot of us \u2014 clearly, some of my fellow chief executives, governors \u2014 couldn\u2019t make that cut,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me it\u2019s a high bar, and that it\u2019s one I\u2019m not going to be able to meet.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio had emphasized during the campaign a list of progressive wins under his leadership, including universal pre-kindergarten, the end of the policing practice known as stop-and-frisk and paid sick leave, all in a city that has a bigger population, more than 8 million, than most U.S. states.\n\nMost New Yorkers had appeared unenthused about de Blasio\u2019s presidential aspirations. A Quinnipiac University poll in April found more than three-quarters of New Yorkers did not feel he should make a White House bid.", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday said during an MSNBC television appearance that he was dropping out of the 2020 presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431974992&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J121", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
