It\u2019s one of the best, if not the best track, on the calendar. It\u2019s where you really get to feel a Formula 1 car come alive and each part of the lap has something special. It\u2019s got a combination of low-speed and high-speed corners but, more than that, it\u2019s the flow and the speed that\u2019s incredible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we describe as an \u2018old-school track\u2019 without much run-off. So there\u2019s very little margin for error and demands even more precision than most other circuits. You have to use every inch of tarmac to be quick there. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a favourite with the drivers and fans too.\n\n\u201cMy favourite corner is the first Degner, which for me is the most impressive corner of the year. It\u2019s probably one of the narrowest corners on the circuit, but you\u2019re doing it in fifth gear and 260-270km/h and that\u2019s very impressive. In qualifying the sensation of speed is incredible.\n\n\u201cGenerally the whole first sector is very special and it\u2019s where we get to feel a Formula 1 car working at its best. It\u2019s all about precision and rhythm. Throughout the weekend you\u2019re just building confidence in that sector and it\u2019s about positioning the car in the right place. \u201cThe Japanese fans make this a special event because of the energy they bring to the track. I also enjoy Japanese food, especially sushi so it\u2019s interesting to try the local stuff.\u201d\n\nCheck out the track map below:\n\nPerez says: \"Suzuka is definitely up there as one of the best circuits in the world. It\u2019s the track that all the drivers love because of the high-speed corners and the first sector is probably the best of the year. It\u2019s where a Formula 1 car really shows its performance because of the quick changes of direction. In qualifying, on low fuel, it\u2019s a very special feeling.\n\n\"It\u2019s not only the first sector that is amazing. The end of the lap has the 130R corner, which is very impressive and you\u2019re still doing 300km/h at the corner exit. Even with the downforce we have on the cars these days, it\u2019s really important to be precise because it\u2019s easy to make a mistake or run wide.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of Japan, I remember the fans. They are amazing. When we leave the hotel in the mornings, they are already there waiting for us. It\u2019s really nice to see how much they love our sport. They are very respectful and polite, and they also make gifts for us.\u201d\n\nOtmar Szanfnauer, team principal says: \"There have been many positives to focus on since the summer break and there\u2019s no doubt that we have taken some important steps forward with car performance. We picked up more points in Russia and I\u2019m optimistic that we can be scoring well in all of the remaining races.\"\n\n\"The race in Japan is always one the team enjoys and it\u2019s a firm favourite with the drivers. The warm reception we receive from the Japanese fans is fantastic and the grandstands are always full. It\u2019s definitely a highlight of the season.\"", "description": "SportPesa Racing Point head to Suzuka for this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix in seventh position in the constructors' championship, a mere three points behind the next team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9445/c1400efa6fa44b6993d0029b0ca42bde.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
