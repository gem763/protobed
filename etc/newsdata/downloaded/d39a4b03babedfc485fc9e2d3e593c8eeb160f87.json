Several other states have made similar moves, although the drug is still considered illegal on the federal level.\n\nButtigieg's ambitious proposal has been to \u201cdecriminalize all drug possession\u201d while expanding access to addiction treatments and improving drug-abuse and mental-health treatment.\n\nButtigieg also said legalizing pot would carry numerous business advantages.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, without legalization, you\u2019re going to continue to see a patchwork of different state laws that create a lot of problems for legitimate businesses like this one,\u201d Buttigieg said outside the Top Notch dispensary in Vegas on a campaign stop.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe not only need to legalize but we also need to pursue experiments, knowing the racial disparity and lives that have been ruined by sentences over marijuana possession.\u201d\n\nOther 2020 Democrats seemed to be on the same page.\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke toured an Oakland, Calif., dispensary last month, and called for allocating monthly stipends to people who were previously locked up for low-level marijuana offenses as a form of recompense.\n\nMeantime, other candidates have admitted to using the drug before. California Sen. Kamala Harris, in a radio interview earlier this year, said, \u201cI have, and I inhaled -- I did inhale. It was a long time ago, but yes.\u201d\n\nZUCKERBERG ADMITS TO ADVISING BUTTIGIEG ON HIRES, SAYS IT'S NOT AN ENDORSEMENT\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, when running in the 2016 primaries, also acknowledged he tried it a couple of times.\n\n\u201cI smoked marijuana twice \u2014 didn\u2019t quite work for me,\u201d he told Yahoo! News.\n\nCandidates have split over how they would legalize marijuana federally. Buttigieg said it would need to be done through the proper legislative channels, while Sanders has expressed that he would use an executive order to carry it out.\n\nButtigieg agreed that the stigma surrounding marijuana use should diminish.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also made a pitch specifically to veterans. \u201cYeah, so I've met a lot of veterans who rely on cannabis for the treatment of diagnosed or undiagnosed issues, often service-connected issues like post-traumatic stress. And, another benefit of decriminalization is, it could pave the way for this to be supported with\u201d the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAsked by another reporter if he had bought any items in the dispensary, which he compared to an Apple Store in appearance, he said: \u201cI will not. I\u2019m on the clock and it\u2019s gonna be a long day.\u201d", "description": "Many Democrats seeking to unseat President Trump in 2020 are calling for decriminalizing marijuana possession on the federal level -- including South Bend, Ind., Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg, who told reporters Wednesday he\u2019s tried the drug a \u201chandful\u201d of times in the past.", "authors": ["Andrew Craft"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/23/694940094001_6097197635001_6097188168001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
