From headteachers to career politicians, anyone with an ounce of morality is constantly weighed down by the impossible decisions they\u2019re forced to make and the fact that not everyone can be helped all of the time. Which is perhaps why so many that are in charge turn out to be such awful people. But these are not issues that are generally raised by most video games, even in a genre like the city builder where you\u2019re in full control of a whole metropolis of people.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect from the people that made This War Of Mine, Frostpunk is different. For a start it\u2019s set in an alternative history post-apocalypse, where the environment never recovered from the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 and you are in control of what seems to be the last human settlement on the planet, in the snowy remains of what used to be Britain. This leaves you to struggle with some very difficult decisions, that would seem monstrous in any other situation, but genuinely are for the greater good \u2013 or at least that\u2019s what you tell yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe link below will take you to our original review of the PC original \u2013 one of our favourite games of last year \u2013 but the good news is that this console edition works extremely well, despite Frostpunk seeming to be a game that would only work well with PC controls. It did always seem as if developer 11 Bit Studios had half an eye on a future console version though and the interface works remarkably well on a controller, making it easy to access all the options you need with the minimum of button presses.\n\nThe very focused nature of the setting means that the camera never becomes too unwieldy, with only the zoom function being slightly jittery on occasion. The graphics looks good too, with some suitably chilly weather effects that seem more effective at this time of year than when the original was released back in April 2018. Frostpunk isn\u2019t a cheery experience and, just like This War Of Mine, it puts you in knowingly impossible situations and forces you to make the best of them.\n\nBut that\u2019s how the real world works and Frostpunk manages to make that point clearly and intelligently, and while still be a highly entertaining video game in its own right.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ORIGINAL FULL REVIEW OF FROSTPUNK\n\nFrostpunk: Console Edition review summary In Short: Becoming one of the best city builders on consoles is the least of Frostpunk\u2019s achievements in this thought-provoking parable about the true cost of being in charge. Pros: A great city-builder with a clever mix of survival elements and random events. Moral decisions are fascinatingly awful to ponder. Console controls and graphics work very well. Cons: The interface can be a little unclear at times, as was the case on PC, and the setting can get a little monotonous on multiple playthroughs.
