There\u2019s more at their fingertips - the division-leading Cardinals lost again on Wednesday, slicing their lead over the Brewers to 1\u00bd games.\n\nMilwaukee trails Washington by one game for the wild card lead.\n\nThe Brewers jogged onto the field and formed a scrum by second base after when Junior Guerra got Christian Colon on a grounder for the final out.\n\nA sizzlin\u2019 September topped off by a bubbly celebration. Nobody does it better than these Brewers.\n\nLast season, they raced from a five-game deficit to the NL Central title by going 19-6 after Sept. 1. They caught the Cubs and won a tiebreaker at Wrigley Field, then swept the Rockies and reached the NL Championship Series before losing in seven games to the Dodgers.\n\nThey\u2019ve pulled off another improbable run with manager Craig Counsell\u2019s outside-the-box resourcefulness, the bullpen\u2019s imperviousness and the offense\u2019s ability to find a new star each game with everything on the line.\n\nBraun - the 2007 NL Rookie of the Year and 2011 NL Most Valuable Player - has found his touch during this current winning streak.\n\nBraun had a solo shot in a 4-2 win in the series opener, and got the celebration started early Wednesday with his eighth career grand slam in the first inning. Teammates were on their feet, leaning against the dugout railing in anticipation of a big night, when he connected off Tyler Mahle (2-12).\n\nWhen Eric Thames followed with another homer, Brewers players jubilantly smacked the green padding atop the dugout railing - the party was on. Keston Hiura also connected off Mahle, whose last win was May 31.\n\nStarter Jordan Lyles (12-8) contributed an infield single and scored a run during the Brewers\u2018 surge to an 8-1 lead after three innings.\n\nLyles gave up Eugenio Su\u00e1rez\u2019s 49th homer, which moved him ahead of Mike Schmidt and Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 for the modern NL record by a third baseman. George Foster holds the club record of 52 homers in 1977.\n\nThis was the sixth overall playoff spot for the Brewers, who started out as the Seattle Pilots in 1969 and moved to Milwaukee the next year. The only other back-to-back playoff appearances came for the Brewers in 1981-82. The franchise has never won the World Series.\n\nONE LEFT\n\nReds broadcaster Marty Brennaman called his second-to-last game along with son Thom. Brennaman is retiring after his 46th season, with Thursday\u2019s game his last. Brewers broadcaster Bob Uecker dropped by during the broadcast. Brennaman hasn\u2019t been able to use his signature \u201cthis one belongs to the Reds\u201d call during the series.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nReds: Sonny Gray had arthroscopic surgery to remove fragments from his pitching elbow, a day after his final start. Gray has pitched with the condition all season and is expected to be ready for spring training.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: Chase Anderson (7-4) is 5-3 in 14 career starts against the Reds, including 0-1 with a 5.51 ERA in three starts this season. Milwaukee finishes out the regular season with a three-game series at Colorado, while St. Louis hosts the Cubs over the weekend.\n\nReds: Luis Castillo (15-7) completes his breakthrough season, including career highs in starts, wins, innings and strikeouts. He\u2019s 3-3 career against Milwaukee.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Milwaukee Brewers clinched their second straight postseason appearance Wednesday night, with Ryan Braun's grand slam sparking a 9-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds that also tightened the NL Central race.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/brewers_reds_baseball_31711_c0-0-4234-2468_s1770x1032.jpg?126a2df6b5d432dcb53d67a15ee9a406cd54ba4e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
