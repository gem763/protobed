The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable.\n\n\"We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\"\n\nMr Gillis' casting came under scrutiny just hours after SNL announced he would be one of three new hires for the show's 45th season.\n\nA podcast resurfaced from September 2018 in which Mr Gillis mocked Chinese people, describing his remarks as \"nice racism\".\n\nIn another episode from the same month, Mr Gillis was heard using homophobic slurs to describe Hollywood producer Judd Apatow and comedian Chris Gethard.\n\nMr Gillis defended the comments on Twitter saying he is a comedian \"who pushes boundaries\".\n\nHe continued: \"My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\"\n\nShortly after the recordings circulated, Good Good Comedy Theatre in Philadelphia, Mr Gillis' hometown, said on Twitter the club had \"deliberately chosen not to work\" with him because of his \"overt racism, sexism, homophobia - expressed both on and off stage\".\n\nIn addition to Mr Gillis, SNL had announced the hiring of two other new cast members: Chloe Fineman and Bowen Yang.\n\nMr Yang will be the show's first full-time Chinese-American cast member.", "description": "Gillis apologised for the remarks saying he was a comedian \"who pushes boundaries\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C62D/production/_108833705_gettyimages-1157500069.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
