(Jeenah Moon/Reuters)\n\nLook, one 2016 candidate being prone to wild and baseless accusations is enough. Appearing on Obama campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s podcast, Hillary Clinton suggested that 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein was a \u201cRussian asset,\u201d that Republicans and Russians were promoting the Green Party, and insinuated that Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard was some sort of tool of the Russian government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got their eye on someone who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said on the podcast. \u201cShe\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nThis is bonkers. You don\u2019t have to look at Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s record on foreign policy for long to find areas for fair criticism, perhaps most infamously her meeting with Bashar al-Assad at the height of the Syrian Civil War, and exhibiting a strange reluctance to criticize the dictator upon her return to the United States. She\u2019s still not willing to say she thinks Assad is a war criminal.\n\nGabbard\u2019s foreign policy views may well be wrongheaded ones. But she\u2019s direct and honest about them, and it\u2019s highly unlikely that she\u2019s been bribed, brainwashed or coerced into these positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabbard\u2019s service in Iraq convinced her that not only was that war a waste of blood and treasure, but our efforts in Afghanistan were similarly unproductive and wasteful as well. In her speeches, she describes her daily duty of going through the list of those wounded and killed, and the \u201cservice members who had eventually come home, with wounds both visible and invisible, wounds and scars that would stay with them for many years to come.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Gabbard\u2019s worldview, the preeminent priority of the United States is avoiding terror attacks and avoiding getting sucked into wars triggered by terror attacks. While she rarely says so explicitly, her experience suggests she sees the the best option to pursue this difficult goal is to reach deals with the brutal but non-Islamist dictators and monarchs who will keep order. Assad, King Abdullah, the Saudis \u2014 in the end, as long as they keep their extremist lunatics from blowing up Americans, we should give them a handshake and let them rule as they see fit.\n\nThe appeal of this approach \u2014 Islamist terrorists get locked up, and American soldiers don\u2019t come home in flag-draped caskets \u2014 is clear. Whether it works is another story. An American alliance with brutal regimes means that at least a little part of the Islamist argument is true, that we believe in freedom and liberty but don\u2019t really want it in the Arab world, and we don\u2019t care about the suffering of Muslims. When push comes to shove, we\u2019re as comfortable dealing with the Saudis about oil as the NBA is with dealing with China about sneakers: just give us what we want and we don\u2019t care what else you\u2019re doing. Oppressive regimes can suppress extremism but they also fuel it. There\u2019s also the fair question of how much we can trust any dictatorial regime. Because these guys have no conscience, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re above trying to play both sides of the street or breaking their promises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHistory suggests that American alliances of convenience with unsavory dictators rarely last or turn out well for us, whether it\u2019s Stalin, Marcos, the Shah, Saddam Hussein against the Iranians, Pakistan\u2026 these relationships almost always come back to bite us. When the masked cops with sticks start beating the local peasants, we end up rooting for the cops because technically the regime is protecting our interests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut again, the U.S. establishment foreign policy consensus \u2014 a consensus that I often agree with! \u2014 is so deeply ingrained that some of its adherents sometimes can\u2019t believe that anyone could honestly disagree; anyone who\u2019s challenging it must be doing so out of bad faith or sinister motives.\n\nUntil Hillary Clinton or anyone else generates some actual proof, treat Tulsi Gabbard for what she appears to be \u2014 an impassioned isolationist who believes the United States has no business attempting to spread our values or stand up for human rights abroad, and who\u2019s comfortable working with brutal dictators if the end result is fewer American casualties.
