Her prayers went unanswered.", "language": "en", "text": "I can tell you most everything about who she was on the outside and about the little things she did that made up daily life with her, but I know almost nothing about her big hopes or her hurts. I don\u2019t know how she ended up living the way she did\u2014what decisions led her to a life with Daddy. She never said anything about any of that. He got between us when I was a girl, and he gets between us now, taking up all the space and spreading over my memories of her like coffee spilled on a white tablecloth. I sift through them to catch a glimpse of her, but he is always in them. He inflicted more pain, so of course I\u2019m going to remember him through episodes that are impossible to forget. He etched them into me. He sits on top of everything and weighs it down like the heavy Southern air does, demanding all of the attention, even in death. She is my foundation and much harder to see. Trying to describe her place in my life is like trying to talk about a book I\u2019ve read while not being able to quote a single sentence from its pages. Its essence winds around my spine and will always be there.", "description": "An excerpt from \u2018Blood,\u2019 a forthcoming memoir by Allison Moorer", "authors": ["Allison Moorer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sOx6vbv5P_TD4FSuke8qTbPXhFg=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OALW3SCD5GKPJ3KGL32KNKD7A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
