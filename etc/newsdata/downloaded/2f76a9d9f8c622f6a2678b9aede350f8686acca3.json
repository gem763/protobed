($1.2bn)\n\nProceeds from the initial public offering will be used to expand the group\u2019s model range. Made-to-measure pleasure crafts can be more than 100ft or 30 m in length and sell for an average price of more than \u20ac1.5 million.\n\nThe flotation comes as demand for luxury yachts has experienced rapid growth, fueled by the global rise of millionaires. There were 22.8 million people worldwide with fortunes of more than $1m last year, an increase of 1.1% on 2017, according to a report by the research company Wealth-X. A further 2,124 people joined the ranks of the super-rich, taking the total number of individuals with personal fortunes of more than $30m to 265,490.\n\nFerretti is majority owned by Weichai, part of the Chinese state-owned Shandong Heavy Industry Group. Weichai is planning to reduce its 86% shareholding, but will retail a controlling stake. Piero Ferrari, the son of Enzo Ferrari, owns a 13% stake in Ferretti.\n\nThis is the second time Ferretti has tried to come to market. The yachtmaker\u2019s then owner, private equity group Candover, abandoned plans for an IPO of the company ten years ago, after the financial crisis hit demand from its rich customer base following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. As a result, Ferretti defaulted on its debt and was taken over by lenders and managers.\n\nFerretti operates six shipyards in Italy and sells its yachts to customers in more than 70 countries. The group\u2019s order backlog rose 19% in the first half of 2019 to \u20ac653 million.\n\nIt reported revenues of \u20ac332 million in the first half of 2019, an 11% increase from the same period last year.", "description": "Their yachts have been favored by some of the world\u2019s rich and famous, from Bridgit Bardot and Sophia Loren in the 1960s and 1970s to George Clooney and Jude...", "authors": ["Lina Saigol"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS372_Ferret_ZG_20191001080107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
