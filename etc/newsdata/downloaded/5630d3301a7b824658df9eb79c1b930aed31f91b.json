Charlie Warzel at The New York Times wrote last month that he hoped these sorts of keynotes would become a thing of the past. I\u2019m absolutely not going to defend all of the pomp and hype, but I do think these things are worth paying attention to.\n\nI want to talk through a specific example of a tech keynote being instructive: Amazon\u2019s big 80-product extravaganza last week. Amazon was communicating something important about itself by cramming so much into such a small space.\n\nEvery company only gets a certain number of opportunities to say, \u201cPay attention to us right now. We have something to say and it\u2019s going to take an hour.\u201d What Apple or Microsoft or Google or whomever decide to do with that very valuable attention is notable.\n\nLet\u2019s take today\u2019s keynote. Microsoft very much needs to tell a story about itself and its hardware because it is seemingly doing at least two big, new things \u2014 and maybe more. New rumors have solidified not only the ARM Surface, but also the likelihood of a dual-screened device and a new flavor of Windows, called Windows 10X.\n\nCommand Line is The Verge\u2019s daily newsletter about personal tech. You should subscribe! We\u2019ll be trying something a little different with the newsletter format over the next few weeks, and I\u2019m really eager to hear your feedback. Please feel free to email me at dieter@theverge.com if you have thoughts. -Dieter\n\n\n\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge that highlights top stories of the day, as well as occasional messages from sponsors and / or partners of The Verge.\n\nHow will Microsoft explain the thinking behind these products? I\u2019m not suggesting we should naively take what\u2019s said on stage at face value, but paying attention can be instructive. We\u2019re going to learn a little more about what Microsoft thinks computers should look like, and the company is going to make an argument. Shouldn\u2019t we want to know what that argument is, even if we disagree with it?\n\nEven though it doesn\u2019t seem like it to an American audience that mostly just buys iPhones, no technology is inevitable. It has to get invented and then that thing could be good or bad. And the quality of those products and how they affect people\u2019s behavior will have real-world effects.\n\nIt feels weird to have to say all this in the first place. But the techlash (a term I hate just based on the awkwardness of the portmanteau) has us all second guessing everything. Good; it should. And if all the big companies want to get together and agree to stop producing these announcement events, that\u2019s fine. But I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nSo if they\u2019re going to happen, we should be getting more out of them than just specs. Being troubled by the effects technology has on us means we should be paying more attention to the devices and software that causes all those effects \u2014 and on why the companies that make those products think they ought to exist in the first place.\n\nOkay, now let\u2019s talk about Amazon. It held an event just last week where 80 \u2014 that\u2019s eight zero \u2014 products were announced, 15 of which were new hardware products from Amazon or one of its subsidiaries. It also wasn\u2019t live streamed online. What is Amazon saying here?\n\nWell, first of all it seems like Amazon is trying to do something different from everybody else. The company would call it humility, but I can\u2019t help but see it as a recognition that Amazon doesn\u2019t make any singular products that can hold the stage for a long time on their own \u2014instead, it makes dozens of near-commodity pieces of hardware. You don\u2019t need a keynote for an Echo Show that fills in a missing screen size between the other screen sizes.\n\nAmazon isn\u2019t saying, \u201cLook at this thing we made,\u201d but instead, \u201cWe made all the things, look!\u201d\n\nWith Apple, you think of the iPhone as the central product and everything else exists in relation to it. Before it was the iPhone, it was the Mac (or perhaps the iPod). After the iPhone it will be something else \u2014 or at least Apple\u2019s investors certainly hope it will be something else.\n\nWith Amazon, I think the intended effect of that wave of products is that you think of Amazon itself as the central thing instead of a specific product like the Echo speaker. Amazon wants you to like Amazon, not the specific products it makes.\n\n(Incidentally, I think that\u2019s why Amazon aggressively promotes Alexa as a \u201cshe\u201d instead of an \u201cit.\u201d It\u2019s not so much about gender as it is about anthropomorphization as a corporate strategy. I think brushing aside the gender issues related to digital assistants is at least as problematic as trying to humanize an algorithm to customers \u2014many of whom are children. That\u2019s why I continue to refer to Alexa and other assistants with \u201cit.\u201d)\n\nIt also reveals a retailer\u2019s mindset. Amazon\u2019s event was more about a holiday product lineup than anything else. That\u2019s really not that far from what every other tech company is doing with its fall hardware events, but you can\u2019t help but feel like Amazon is more excited about having fully stocked virtual shelves than about the specific things on those shelves.\n\nYes, Amazon wants to make an Echo device the centerpiece of your kitchen, but it\u2019s also perfectly happy to have it be an impulse buy.\n\nAmazon\u2019s hardware event was worth paying attention to because it confirmed that Amazon isn\u2019t trying to shoehorn its way into your digital life with one huge, hit product but instead dozens cheaper ones. Why take on Android or the iPhone or Windows directly when you can flood the space between them?\n\nThe Fire phone flopped (sorry to bring it up again), so Amazon doesn\u2019t have phones. And it doesn\u2019t make laptops, either. But TV sticks? Got \u2018em, at every price point. TVs? Amazon\u2019s partners got \u2018em. Speakers: got \u2018em in four different sizes, with or without screens. Headphones, microwaves, smart plugs, cameras, Wi-Fi routers \u2014 Amazon\u2019s got \u2018em all.\n\nThere\u2019s one key announcement inside all of those other announcements that I think deserves more attention, and that relates directly to the idea that the real message of Amazon\u2019s keynote was the centrality of Amazon itself, not the specs on a fancy Echo Studio speaker. That\u2019ll have to wait for another newsletter, though (here\u2019s where to subscribe to get it in your inbox).\n\nFor today, watch what Microsoft announces, but also watch for how it announces those things. What the company tells you about its laptops will be about more than making fun of MacBook keyboards. How Microsoft talks about its more forward-looking devices will tell you what\u2019s next for Windows \u2014 the second-most-used operating system on the planet.\n\nMore on Microsoft\u2019s hardware event\n\n+ Leak reveals Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro 7, 15-inch Surface Laptop, and ARM-powered Surface\n\nAfter opining so much on what I think Microsoft should do, it was gratifying to see that these leaks look so good. Will they perform? Hard to say, but getting traditional win32 apps to work well on ARM has been a challenge. Just ask Steven Sinofsky \u2014 he knows of what he speaks on this topic.\n\n+ Leak reveals Windows 10X, Microsoft\u2019s new OS for dual-screen devices\n\nWhat is Microsoft trying to do here, compete with Google for having its devices leaked?\n\n+ Why Microsoft has to bet big on an ARM-based Surface\n\nHere\u2019s an important update I put up regarding yesterday\u2019s newsletter:\n\nThen there was the very first Surface (aka the Surface RT), which also ran ARM. The original version of this article didn\u2019t mention it, which was a stupid oversight especially since I was literally at that launch event personally. That Surface was a classic example of launching before everything was ready: it was too slow running apps and didn\u2019t have enough native apps to work well. (I regret the error in the previous paragraph from the original piece and thanks to Eric for the email about it.)\n\nMore from The Verge\n\n+ Obviously this is the biggest story of the day. If you missed it, go read it: In leaked audio, Mark Zuckerberg rallies Facebook against critics and the US government\n\n+ GoPro\u2019s new Hero 8 Black does more of the work for you\n\nThe way Sean O\u2019Kane describes the video stabilization here makes me sort of think I made a mistake getting that Osmo Pocket. They\u2019re different types of cameras, but this GoPro looks really good. I\u2019m not an action cam kind of person, but I do love having a camera separate from my phone for shooting. Can\u2019t wait to see how this thing performs in our review. Just kidding, we don\u2019t have to wait, there\u2019s a review for you right here.\n\n+ Skydio 2: the self-flying future of drones starts at $999\n\nSean Hollister is really impressed with this thing. After watching the video of it in action (which you should also watch), I am too.\n\n+ The FCC can repeal net neutrality, but it can\u2019t block state laws, says court\n\nI assume this will be appealed. I also am not super hopeful that will matter. Which means that the fight will move to the states and also to the next election.\n\n+ The iPhone 11\u2019s Deep Fusion camera is now in the iOS 13 developer beta\n\nNilay Patel has a good explanation for how this works. One interesting note from John Gruber, too: since the ultrawide doesn\u2019t support it, if you turn on \u201ccapture outside the frame,\u201d you won\u2019t get Deep Fusion.\n\nOne thing this fancy technology won\u2019t fix: having to head over to the settings app to change your video resolution.", "description": "Tech keynotes reveal more than just products", "authors": ["Dieter Bohn", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8HtQ7wTJUR1NzxqXCBl_fqYGrQ=/0x145:2000x1192/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19251385/lcimg_1f0cd47c_d035_4834_a2bd_7f25bd40fdf4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
