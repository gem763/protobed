Open Minds No sign as yet what the ERG/Tory Brexit die-hards, might make of a Johnson-reached deal with concessions over NI customs arrangements. One such Tory MP tells me they are \"keeping an open mind\" until more details emerge. \u2014 Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) October 10, 2019 Deputy prime minister of Ireland Simon Coveney on the Brexit deadline.\n\nBack in Dublin, @simoncoveney says \u201csignificant Amount of work to be done\u201d to seal Brexit deal - but can be done before end of October \u2014 Dara Doyle (@DaraDoy) October 10, 2019\n\nHaving watched EU politics for years, I am not at all surprised by news Varadkar says new agreement 'possible' by end of October after talks with Johnson.\n\n\"For the first time in months, there is a more optimistic tone in tomorrow\u2019s newspapers on the prospect of a deal being reached with the EU.\"\n\nThis is very typical of EU politics as I have commented many times.\n\nDespite the hardening language of just a day ago, after a meeting between Johnson and Varadkar, a deal is suddenly back in play.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nDid Johnson give in on something? Yes, he had to. Giving the DUP a veto was never going to fly.\n\nAnything more is difficult to say.\n\nDid Ireland give in on something? That's not certain, but it's possible, if not likely.\n\nWhat If?\n\nIf Johnson does produce a deal, it may come with a do or die proviso.\n\nIf so, there will be no further extensions.\n\nParliament will have to accept the deal or face a No Deal result on October 31.\n\nPerhaps there is a short extension into November or even January 31, 2020 but only to tie up loose ends.\n\nI suspect the UK parliament would agree to the deal on those conditions. If not, No Deal on October 31.\n\nThere is a small chance that the European Parliament rejects the deal after approval by the UK. The result would be the same: No Deal.\n\nOdds?\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat did Johnson give away? The EU?\n\nIf there is a deal, we will find out shortly.\n\nBut here we are, discussing a deal that most thought \"impossible\".\n\nI never thought that, noting many last second EU deals, but it sure looked grim just a day ago.", "description": "A Brexit deal is back in play following a between .10/11/2019 15:46:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/16/09c13019-67e1-4e66-8be9-51be0fc02227.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
