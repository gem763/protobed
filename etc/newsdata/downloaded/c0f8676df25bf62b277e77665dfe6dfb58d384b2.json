Fortnite/Epic Games\n\nDespite being played by vast numbers of players around the world, Fortnite regularly goes down for new updates and maintenance on its servers. During that time, it is impossible to play the battle royale game since it relies on a constant internet connection.\n\nEarlier this month, the game went down for days. The in-game world was swallowed by a black hole and then servers went offline, leaving it unplayable.\n\nWhen it came back, it was the beginning of \"Chapter 2\", which brought a variety of updates to the game.", "description": "Fortnite has gone down ahead of a major update.
