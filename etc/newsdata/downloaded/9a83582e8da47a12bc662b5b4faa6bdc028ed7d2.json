General Assembly in New York. (Jason Szenes/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nPresident Trump struck a stance of defiance Wednesday, proclaiming his innocence and leveling distortions and falsehoods after the publicly released notes of his phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart turbocharged the push on Capitol Hill for his impeachment.\n\nThe five pages of a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden landed like a hand grenade on Capitol Hill and led House Democrats to recalibrate their strategy.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her fellow Democratic leaders agreed to speed up their impeachment investigation and significantly narrow it to Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, according to five Democrats familiar with their discussions during a closed-door emergency meeting Wednesday in Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\nDemocratic leaders see the evidence from the Zelensky call as damning enough to impeach \u2014 and easy enough for the public to digest \u2014 in isolation, without drawing in allegations of obstruction of justice, self-dealing and other wrongdoing. Leaders began discussing a swift timeline to, in the words of one member, \u201cstrike while the iron\u2019s hot\u201d and possibly vote on articles of impeachment before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very understandable,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). \u201cIt\u2019s a betrayal of the presidency of the United States, which is now making deals to affect an election, to go after an opponent with a foreign leader who is relying on the United States.\u201d\n\n[Trump offered Ukrainian president Justice Dept. help for Biden investigation, memo shows]\n\nTrump presented himself as an aggrieved victim of \u201cviciousness\u201d from Democrats and the media during a meandering and uncharacteristically muted news conference late Wednesday in New York. He defended his conduct in the July 25 call with Zelensky as \u201cwonderful,\u201d \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d and pledged to release a rough transcript of an earlier call from April with the Ukrainian leader to help him make his case.\n\n\u201cNo push, no pressure, no nothing \u2014 it\u2019s all a hoax, folks. It\u2019s all a big hoax,\u201d Trump told reporters on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. He called scrutiny of the conversation \u201ca joke. Impeachment for that?\u201d\n\nThe clash comes one day after Pelosi announced that the House was opening an impeachment inquiry into what Democrats characterize as an abuse of presidential power by Trump that compromised national security.\n\nThe impeachment showdown opened a new phase of the Trump presidency. He and his advisers have scrambled to adjust on the fly and from afar during a week of diplomacy at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cWe have a pre-5 o\u2019clock presidency and a post-5 o\u2019clock presidency,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House strategist. \u201cPelosi\u2019s announcement to begin a formal process at 5 p.m. was the shot at Fort Sumter. Now you cannot freelance, you cannot go rogue. You have to be disciplined. You have to be high and tight.\u201d\n\nIn the words of most Republican officeholders, there was a robotic echo of White House talking points. \u201cWow. Impeachment over this?\u201d tweeted Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). \u201cWhat a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger.\u201d\n\nStill, cracks began to emerge in the president\u2019s coalition. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called the president\u2019s conduct on the call \u201ctroubling in the extreme\u201d and \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters that \u201cRepublicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons and say there\u2019s no \u2018there\u2019 there when there\u2019s obviously a lot that\u2019s very troubling there.\u201d\n\n[Cracks emerge among Senate Republicans over Trump urging Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden]\n\nMeanwhile, four Republican senators said privately in interviews that the White House erred by releasing the rough transcript \u2014 one calling it a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that they now feel forced to defend. They argued that it sets a precedent for future presidents about disclosure of calls with foreign leaders and could be seen as a concession to Democrats. But they saved most of those complaints for closed-door talks, a recognition of Trump as the linchpin of their party and critical for their prospects in the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) heads to a closed-door security briefing Wednesday at the Capitol. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) condemned Pelosi\u2019s opening of impeachment proceedings as \u201can impeachment parade in search of a rationale.\u201d Some of his longtime allies were holding out hope that the effort will fade in the House and said McConnell had not begun preparing for an impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\n\u201cZero. None. No discussions of a trial. You prepare for the probable, not the improbable. I just can\u2019t imagine a universe in which they end up doing that,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). \u201cNancy Pelosi is simply too shrewd to let things get out of control.\u201d\n\nOn the House side, Republicans attempted to make light of news developments. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), one of several Republicans who visited the White House on Wednesday morning to view the rough transcript and be briefed on talking points, passed out \u201cmad libs impeachment\u201d games during a private GOP conference meeting.\n\n\u201cResolved, that Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, is impeached for _______ (made-up crime) because the Democrat Majority in the House of Representatives still refuses to accept the results of the 2016 election and since the Democrat Majority\u2019s previous impeachment attempts through ________ (sham hearing), _______ (dud report), and _________ (political stunt) failed,\u201d read the game.\n\nIn New York on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s demeanor shifted throughout the day. He fired off angry tweets in the morning and was punchy during his much-anticipated face-to-face meeting with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re with the president of Ukraine, and he\u2019s made me more famous, and I\u2019ve made him more famous,\u201d Trump said to laughter as they began their bilateral session.\n\nZelensky, a comedian before ascending to the presidency, quipped, \u201cIt\u2019s a great pleasure to me to be here, and it\u2019s better to be on TV than by phone.\u201d\n\nTrump then speculated that Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails may be housed somewhere in Ukraine. He recalled that she had said she deleted them because many were about yoga or planning her daughter\u2019s wedding. \u201cShe does a lot of yoga, right?\u201d Trump joked about his 2016 rival, with Zelensky looking on.\n\nTrump also falsely accused Sens. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) of threatening to cut financial assistance to Ukraine over reports that officials impeded cooperation with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation. Trump cited a letter the senators sent to Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor in May 2018, but at no point in the correspondence did they threaten defunding.\n\nA couple of hours later, at the news conference, Trump was relatively subdued as he delivered a more-than-20-minute monologue decrying the impeachment proceedings and complaining that the media is not paying more attention to what he promotes as diplomatic accomplishments.\n\nWhen a reporter asked him to explain to the American people why he believed it was appropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader for information about a domestic political rival, Trump deflected and demurred. He claimed an Obama administration conspiracy, touted his latest poll numbers, bragged about his strategy to win the electoral college in 2016 and tweaked Clinton for neglecting to campaign in Wisconsin.\n\nAsked whether he was braced for a long impeachment saga, Trump replied: \u201cI thought we won. I thought it was dead. It was dead. The Mueller report, no obstruction, no collusion.\u201d He went on to mock two Democratic committee chairmen leading the impeachment investigation, Reps. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), and accuse them of acting \u201cso serious\u201d while in private \u201cthey must laugh their asses off, but it is so bad for our country.\u201d\n\n[Pelosi, top Democrats favor quick, narrow Trump impeachment probe focused on Ukraine]\n\nAt the Capitol on Wednesday, Pelosi and her top lieutenants agreed on a significant shift for the House impeachment strategy. In recent months, Pelosi had implored committee chairs to probe their own jurisdictional matters at their own pace: The Intelligence Committee would focus on Russia and Ukraine, the Judiciary Committee on potential obstruction detailed in the Mueller report and hush payments to women alleging affairs, and the Oversight Committee on allegations Trump has used his office to enrich himself.\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) at the Capitol on Wednesday. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nNone of those issues seemed to break through meaningfully with voters, and public sentiment has remained largely against impeaching Trump. But Pelosi and senior Democrats now believe that the Ukraine call and whistleblower complaint could change that dynamic.\n\n\u201cIt goes right to the top of the list,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of Pelosi\u2019s leadership team and the Judiciary Committee. \u201cWe are not talking about some discrete historical transgression. We\u2019re looking at an ongoing and continuing pattern of assault on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nPelosi told colleagues that keeping the inquiry narrowly focused on Ukraine allegations could also help keep the overall impeachment process out of the courts, where a slew of other investigative matters have been bogged down for months. They did not rule out ultimately including other issues in drafting articles of impeachment.\n\nSchiff seized on Trump\u2019s conduct in the Zelensky call as a \u201cclassic mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader,\u201d calling the rough transcript \u201cfar more damning than I and others had imagined.\u201d\n\nEven some of the most cautious House Democrats are behind Pelosi\u2019s plan to narrow the scope of impeachment proceedings. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who last year won a long-held GOP seat, said drafting articles of impeachment focused solely on the Ukraine matter would make the most sense, because it has united the party and could be easily articulated to voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty straightforward,\u201d Spanberger said. \u201cThese allegations are about something the sitting U.S. president allegedly did. And they are targeted at potentially influencing the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis and Colby Itkowitz in Washington and Seung-Min Kim in New York contributed to this report.", "description": "The showdown opened a new phase of the Trump presidency.
