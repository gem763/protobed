Officials are attributing the drop in the deficit to better than expected revenues because of a hot economy, and lower than expected expenses.\n\nIn August 2018, the Ford government said the 2018-19 deficit was running at $15 billion. The government trimmed that projection to $14.5 billion in November when it released its fall economic statement.\n\nThe government stuck with that figure until April, when it tabled this year's budget, and revised the 2018-19 projected deficit to $11.7 billion.\n\nCorporate tax revenue was up $1 billion from the previous fiscal year, reflecting what the government said was a 9.6 per cent increase in corporate profits.\n\nThe government is still projecting a $10.3 billion deficit for 2019-20, but could lower that when Finance Minister Rod Phillips tables the fall economic statement, due by November 15.", "description": "Ontario's deficit for 2018-19 is half what the Ford government claimed it was after taking power from the Kathleen Wynne's Liberals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5207417.1562881889!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/premiers-meeting-20190710.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
