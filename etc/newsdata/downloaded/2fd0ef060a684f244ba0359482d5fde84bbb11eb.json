(CBC)\n\nThe house to which it was originally linked sold several years back, but the garage was kept in the original owner's name. Now, that the owner has died and their estate is selling the land, Khadem said.\n\nAfter knocking down the garage and building on the site, he said, there would be room for a two-storey house with a finished basement that's anywhere from 1,500 to 2,000 square feet.\n\nKhadem also said that $599,000 is \"100 per cent\" a reasonable price for the property.\n\n\"The reason being, you can't find land right now in Toronto,\" he said.\n\nSteven Foster, who lives nearby, disagreed \u2014 at least about the price point.\n\n\"I think it's crazy but I'm not that surprised, because my expectations for housing prices are just through the roof,\" he said. \"The thing that shocks me the most is how normal that seems to me now.\"\n\nBalkar Jagpal lives in a house two houses down from the garage that is up for sale on a lot that he says is the same size. (CBC)\n\nMarjolyn Vanderhart, who has lived in the neighbourhood for 20 years, also wasn't shocked.\n\n\"I'm not surprised. I'm sad, because it shouldn't be like that \u2014 makes it inaccessible for a lot of young people,\" she said. \"This used to be a neighbourhood where first-time home buyers could buy in, and it's not that anymore.\"\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Toronto Real Estate Board, the average selling price for a home in Toronto was $792,611 last month, which is up by 3.6 per cent year-over-year.\n\nThe average price of a detached home in the City of Toronto was listed at $1,246,392, compared to $712,934 for townhouses and $619,307 for condos.\n\nSetting price aside, the amount of space available here does work for some people. Balkar Jagpal lives just two houses down from the garage that's for sale on a lot that's the exact same size: 20 feet by 100 feet.\n\nHis property used to be a small bungalow, which was perfect for him and his wife, he said. Once they had kids, they started adding to the home by finishing the basement and building a second floor.\n\nNow, his family has 2,100 square feet of space, Jagpal said.\n\n\"It's more than enough for our purposes,\" he said.\n\nadam.carter@cbc.ca", "description": "If there was ever a perfect encapsulation of the state of Toronto\u2019s cutthroat housing market, it\u2019s this \u2014\u00a0a garage up for sale near The Danforth that\u2019s listed at $599,000.", "authors": ["Adam Carter Is A Newfoundlander Who Now Calls Toronto Home.
