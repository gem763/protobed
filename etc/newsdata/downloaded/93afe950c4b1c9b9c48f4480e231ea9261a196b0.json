No different than he has earlier in the course of the season and we\u2019ll continue to make those evaluations on a day by day basis that gives us a chance to win,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Aug. 28, Syndergaard allowed a career-high 10 runs in a 10-7 loss to the Cubs in a game started by Ramos. Last week, he struck out 10 in seven scoreless innings in Washington with Ren\u00e9 Rivera behind the plate.\n\nSyndergaard has a 5.09 ERA in 15 games pitching to Ramos and a 2.45 ERA in 10 games pitching to Tomas Nido. He also had an 8.10 ERA in two games pitching to Travis d\u2019Arnaud, whom he was acquired with from Toronto following the 2012 season for R.A. Dickey.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Noah communicating his thoughts,\u201d Van Wagenen said. \u201cIn this organization, we don\u2019t suppress feelings and harbor ill will.\u201d\n\nOn June 9 against Colorado, Syndergaard allowed one hit in seven innings while throwing to Nido. He allowed five runs and five stolen bases in his next start against St. Louis when he also strained his right hamstring.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make everybody happy and it\u2019s not about making guys happy,\u201d manager Mickey Callaway said. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning at this point.\u201d\n\nSyndergaard is 10-7 with a career-high 4.06 ERA in 28 starts this season. His name was mentioned in trade speculation as the July 31 deadline approached.\n\nSyndergaard can be a free agent following the 2021 season.\n\nRamos signed a two-year, $19 million contract as one of Van Wagenen\u2019s free agent acquisitions in his first offseason since moving from being an agent to New York\u2019s front office.\n\nRamos entered Monday batting .298 with 14 homers and 71 RBIs. He batted .430 during a career-high 26-game hitting streak that ended Wednesday.\n\nThe Mets began Monday 25-14 in the second half with Ramos as the starting catcher. They are 9-6 when Ramos has caught Syndergaard.\n\n\u201cWilson is a good player, Noah is a very good player,\u201d Van Wagenen said. \u201cEverybody out there is doing their best to try to win a game, so my comfort level with all those guys is that every time somebody takes the field, they\u2019re going to give their all.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen has denied a rift exists between pitcher Noah Syndergaard and the team over Wilson Ramos catching his starts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/phillies_mets_baseball_33908_c0-126-3016-1884_s1770x1032.jpg?8f337b15343773ba7ff712f6261dd23d6019e088", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
