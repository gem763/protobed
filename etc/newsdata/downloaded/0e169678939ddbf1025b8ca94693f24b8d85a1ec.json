The UAW\u2019s national council will decide Thursday whether to recommend the agreement for a ratification vote, and if the strike will continue while members cast ballots.\n\n\u201cThe number one priority of the national negotiation team has been to secure a strong and fair contract that our members deserve,\u201d UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement. He said the union\u2019s bargaining committee voted to recommend that the GM National Council \u2014 which is comprised of presidents and chairmen of locals around the country \u2014 vote in favor of putting the deal up for a ratification vote.\n\nGM shares rose as much as 2.6 per cent to US$37.22, the highest intraday in two weeks. The UAW\u2019s statement didn\u2019t provide details on the deal reached with the company.\n\nRatification Challenge\n\nGetting the new four-year agreement approved by the rank-and-file could be a challenge. GM outraged union workers last year by threatening four U.S. plants with possible closure, though it\u2019s offered to keep at least one of those factories open.\n\nUAW leaders also have credibility issues: President Gary Jones was implicated last month by federal prosecutors in an indictment of a former confidant who conspired to embezzle member dues and spend the money on stays at luxury villas, golf gear and cigars.\n\nIssues that have divided the automaker and union since the strike took effect Sept. 16 included allocation of future product to plants GM said last year no longer have vehicles to build, the treatment of temporary workers and the rising cost of health-care coverage.\n\nA resolution would come none too soon for GM, which analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate has lost about US$2 billion, and its striking workers, who could be forgoing about US$2,000 of profit sharing. The strike has also become a political issue, arising in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, which has lost thousands of auto-industry jobs.\n\nThe two sides moved closer to a deal over the weekend after a tense week of publicly exchanging barbs and blame for the strike dragging on. With most of the major issues settled, Barra and GM President Mark Reuss joined the talks Tuesday to try to get a final agreement over the line, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified.\n\n$2 Billion Blow\n\nWith plants across the U.S. idled and shutdowns spilling over into Mexico and Canada, the automaker is losing about US$100 million a day in earnings before interest and taxes, John Murphy, a BofA analyst who recommends buying GM shares, wrote in a research report Tuesday. And in addition to the profit-sharing they\u2019ll miss, Murphy estimates UAW members have probably forgone as much as US$4,000 in net take-home pay.\n\n\u201cA prolonged strike could burn significant cash and bring GM to its knees,\u201d Murphy wrote. \u201cBut investors likely will also react negatively if management is perceived to have caved into labour\u2019s demands and GM\u2019s long-term competitiveness is threatened.\u201d\n\nA GM spokesman declined to comment on the BofA report.\n\nDemocratic Debate\n\nGM and the strike ended up being fodder for presidential candidates in Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker criticizing trade deals that don\u2019t put workers \u201cat the center,\u201d an oblique reference to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s accord to replace Nafta.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, said workers striking outside GM\u2019s idled Chevy Cruze plant in Lordstown, Ohio \u2014 about 150 miles northeast from where the debate took place \u2014 had been \u201cdevastated by GM and their malfeasance.\u201d The automaker ranks No. 72 among the largest employers in Ohio, one of the moderators noted; it was No. 1 less than 25 years ago.\n\nCandidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said it was common to see closed-down factories out the windows of his dad\u2019s Chevy Cavalier during drives to school growing up. \u201cNow I drive my own Chevy \u2014 it\u2019s a Chevy Cruze, used to be built right in Lordstown \u2014 which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers.\u201d\n\nIt was still the most prominent role the auto industry has played in any of the debates thus far \u2014 despite Detroit hosting one of them in late July.\n\nOnce the UAW\u2019s GM membership ratifies the contract, the union will turn its attention to either Ford Motor Co. or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. The UAW typically tries to use the first agreement as a pattern for the others. The union extended its contracts with Ford and Fiat Chrysler on Sept. 13 to focus on GM.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Union council to decide on vote tomorrow and whether strike continues", "authors": ["David Welch", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/uaw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
