The protections stem from Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act, and appear in the USMCA and in a pact with Japan signed Monday. (New York Times)\n\nTalking point: It\u2019s a sign of a deepening rift between America and other parts of the world over how Big Tech should be regulated. The EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has been notoriously hard on global tech giants, leading U.S. President Donald Trump to assert that Vestager \u201chates the United States perhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d Vestager is set to take on a second term in November, in addition to a beefed-up role overseeing the bloc\u2019s digital policy, and has vowed to broaden her regulatory toolbox, looking beyond fines to rein the companies in. However, she also said Tuesday that breaking up tech companies would be a last resort. Those comments starkly contrast those made by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has stated that her administration would break up firms like Google and Facebook.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
