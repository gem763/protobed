Normally, the local transportation law bans unlicensed companies from offering paid ride services.Tada claims all it is doing is linking customers with 11-passenger vans and with the drivers of those vans.Prosecutors concluded otherwise. Their rationale was based on how consumers regard the service: If Tada users treat its vans more or less the same as taxis, the start-up should obtain the government license required for offering paid transportation services.\u201cWhat\u2019s important is how the users perceive the service,\u201d said a prosecution source. \u201cTo claim that Tada offers a rented car with drivers isn\u2019t justifiable in a situation where all of its users think Tada is similar to taxis.\u201dThe local taxi industry has argued that the exception for rented vans was intended to serve tourists and boost the tourism industry, not to allow vans to offer taxi services. Tada has fiercely fought back.When SPTA directors filed a complaint in February, the company disclosed a determination by the Seoul Metropolitan Government saying that Tada\u2019s service is legal.Last June, prosecutors requested the Transport Ministry to review the matter but did not get a response.\u201cThe prosecutors\u2019 indictment was always a variable, but the government\u2019s stance was that the issue should be resolved through regulation,\u201d said a ministry source. \u201cThe government has its own job to do, and the prosecutors are doing theirs.\u201dThe taxi industry welcomed the decision.A day after the prosecutor\u2019s announcement, the SPTA said the prosecutor\u2019s decision \u201cclearly demonstrates Tada\u2019s illegality.\u201d\u201cThe government\u2019s neglect is what dragged the situation to its current state,\u201d the association representative said at the press conference. \u201cTada has mocked Korea\u2019s law, and the government should immediately order it to halt services. Hesitating to do so is clearly a dereliction of duty.\u201dSocar CEO Lee, founder of Daum and a well-known figure in Korea\u2019s IT scene, has been critical of regulations preventing the growth of start-ups.\u201cToday, the president promised a shift to a \u2018negative\u2019 regulatory framework that will allow everything except what\u2019s banned by law. On the same day, prosecutors indicted Tada, Socar and its two leaders,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday.\u201cDomestic law states [Tada] can work; the police concluded it doesn\u2019t breach the law; for over a year, the Transport Ministry never stopped us for reasons of illegality,\u201d he added.The Korea Startup Forum, which advocates for local start-ups, released a statement in support of Tada Tuesday, saying the indictment shows how the \u201cgovernment, National Assembly and prosecutors\u201d are suffocating the local start-up ecosystem.\u201cRegulation is not a problem - new services naturally entail conflict with existing regulation. What\u2019s important is the process of resolving it. But in the last few years, \u2018rationality\u2019 was barely present when start-ups struggled to untangle regulation issues. How can they venture into new areas and lead innovation in such an environment?\u201d the statement said.VCNC and Socar vowed to vigorously fight the charges. For now, Tada said it does not plan to halt services, but it is unclear whether the service can continue to operate before the court rules. In other similar cases, companies halted operation as the court heard the case.The punishment for violating laws on paid ride services is two years in prison or a fine of under 20 million won ($17,166).\u201cIt may be possible to offer services before the court\u2019s final ruling, but if the court does find them guilty, having done so will increase their burden because the court can see it from a negative view to consider their crime to be heavier,\u201d said Kim Han-gyu, a lawyer and former chair of the Seoul Bar Association.In additional to the indictment, Tada faces issues that threaten its survival. Liberal Democratic Party Lawmaker Rep. Park Hong-keun recently submitted a bill to eliminate the clause that Tada had used to justify its operation.Other local start-ups that offer van-hailing services, like ChaCha and Papa, are also exposed to the ruling.\u201cThe indictment will decide Tada\u2019s current fate, while the bill will decide its future,\u201d said an anonymous mobile start-up source.\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable that [prosecutors] would make a start-up founder into a criminal.\u201dBY PARK MIN-JE, JEONG JIN-HO AND SONG KYOUNG-SON [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
