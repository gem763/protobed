Fear of death is normal. I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t fear death when you\u2019re chasing after convicts. But when you run away from doctor, that means you have to do your own doctoring.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE after the diagnosis, Dr. Oz says Dog was \u201cdenying care that he knew would be life saving.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Dog the Bounty Hunter Tearfully Shares the Touching Dream He Had About Late Wife Beth Chapman\n\n\u201c[Duane] was fearful,\u201d he reveals. \u201cBeth had been his north star. She was the one that would go with him and keep him balanced so he could deal with these things. Losing her took away his biggest support.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What would Beth do,\u2019 \u201d he adds. \u201d \u2018What would she say to you? I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be happy with what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re throwing away your life, you\u2019re throwing away your ability to parent your kids. You have to man up.\u2019 That\u2019s what she would say.\u201d\n\nDr. Oz and Duane Chapman More\n\nAnd Dog, though weary of doctors and hospitals, eventually came to an understanding and agreement.\n\n\u201cI hesitated for a minute thinking, I don\u2019t want to have to go through this again,\u201d Dog tells PEOPLE. \u201cI don\u2019t want to die right now. I\u2019m not afraid to die anymore, but I really didn\u2019t care for awhile if something would happen. I do care now.\u201d\n\nNow, Dog \u2014 who is on blood thinners, a healthy diet, and is making strides towards kicking his smoking habit \u2014 is on the road to recovery.\n\n\u201cOnce this goes away, I am 100 percent. I\u2019ve had fears. The blood clot is not a normal thing but it happens a lot, but I\u2019m going to be 100 percent. I\u2019m encouraged by it,\u201d he says.\n\nDuane Chapman and Dr. Oz | The Dr. Oz Show More\n\nIn mid-September, Dog was taken to a hospital in Colorado after feeling a pain in his chest, TMZ reported. His hospitalization came nearly three months after Beth died of complications from throat cancer on June 26.
