I have got no idea what you are referring to\n\n\"I certainly would advise Wayne to give no comment to it because it is obviously one salacious story that someone has managed to spin. It is of no interest to us.\"\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nRooney scored an early penalty against Iceland but England were stunned in the last-16 clash, which has gone down as one of their worst ever performances.\n\nVardy, who scored against Wales earlier in the tournament, came on as a substitute but could not keep England in the tournament.\n\nThe Leicester striker, 32, won 26 caps for his country but ended his international career after the World Cup in Russia in 2018.\n\nRooney remains England's all-time record goalscorer, although the strike against Iceland was his last in a Three Lions shirt.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nColeen accusation in full\n\nFor a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The SUN newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nThere has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\nAfter a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nTo try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while.)\n\nOver the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account / individual it's come from.\n\nI have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\nIt's ..........Rebekah Vardy's account.\n\nRebekah Vardy issues denial in full\n\n(Image: FIFA)\n\nAs I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.\n\nI never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.\n\nIf you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\nOver the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.\n\nI'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?\n\nI liked you a lot Coleen & I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.\n\nI'm disgusted that I'm even having o deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.", "description": "Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen has claimed fellow WAG Rebekah has secretly sold details about her personal life to the press", "authors": ["Liam Prenderville", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images", "Daily Mirror", "Michael Regan - The Fa", "Reuters", "Fifa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543504.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
