If you choose something from the most popular list you run the risk of your child being one of five Olivia or Olivers on the pre-school register. Hardly surprising, therefore, that parents-to-be are increasingly opting to look for something a little more unique.\n\nThe trouble is that in the strive for a stand-out name some mums and dads-to-be risk choosing something banned.\n\nJust ask Claire Alexander-Johnston.\n\nThe mum-of-four from Byron Bay, Australia, recently revealed that the naming process for her fourth child had taken longer than expected after she ran into a potential legal issue.\n\nSharing some sweet images of her newborn son on her Instagram account Jetsetmama, she wrote: \u201cWelcome to the family Citizen Sage Alexander-Johnston.\n\n\u201cSorry this naming business has taken so long! We had a bit of a curveball when we announced your name to our family, as someone pointed out, it\u2019s possibly illegal to name you that in Australia, as it falls loosely under the category of \u2018title\u2019 like \u2018King\u2019 \u2018Duke\u2019 \u2018Lord\u2019 or \u2018Captain\u2019.\n\nREAD MORE: Your baby names fall into one of 13 'tribes', research reveals\n\n\u201cWe tried to change it. \u2018Disco\u2019 even came back into play! But nothing else felt right for you as a Libra, with a [very sensible and grounded] Capricorn moon. So Citizen you are, and always will be - a Citizen of the world.\u201d\n\nAccording to Australian law, names that are contrary to the public interest by being \u201cmisleading\u201d are often banned.\n\nThe Births Deaths and Marriages site states: \u201cthe name might contain an official title, position or rank recognised in the community that might mislead others as to whether the person holds that title or rank officially.\u201d\n\nOver in the UK similar rulings apply. According to Deedpoll.org.uk restrictions on names will come into force if the prospective name may result in others believing you have a conferred or inherited honour, title, rank or academic award.\n\n\u201cFor example, a change of first name to Sir, Lord, Laird, Lady, Prince, Princess, Viscount, Baron, Baroness, General, Captain,\u201d the site explains.\n\nWhether or not the moniker Citizen is illegal, it certainly received a positive response from Claire\u2019s followers, with many praising the mum\u2019s bold choice.\n\n\u201cSo has it been approved by the BDM!? Such a cool name and so hope it gets approved if its not already,\u201d one follower wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat an amazing name!!!\u201d agreed another.\n\n\u201cCitizen Sage is an epic name for an epic wee man,\u201d yet another fan commented.\n\nThe mum is obviously a fan of unusual monikers as her eldest three children are called Atlas, Everest and Zephyr and Citizen\u2019s middle name is Sage.\n\nREAD MORE: Kirsty, Gemma, Craig and Andrew: The baby names becoming 'extinct' in 2019\n\nOther banned baby names\n\nAlexander-Johnston isn\u2019t the only parent to find themselves pushing baby name boundaries.\n\nLast year it was revealed a French couple had been banned from naming their baby girl, Liam, after a judge warned she could get confused about her gender.\n\nThe unnamed parents wanted to give their third child, born in November, the traditionally-male name, but French prosecutors stepped in.\n\nAlso in France, a court ruled a couple could not use the moniker Fa\u00f1ch that they\u2019d chosen for their baby boy.\n\nThe court in Quimper, north west France ruled that the new parents would not be able to use the character \u00f1 (called a tilde) in their baby\u2019s name.\n\nInstead Jean-Christophe Bernard and his wife were told that they would have to find an alternative.\n\nIn 2015 a court in Valenciennes, decided that a couple would not be allowed to name their daughter \u2018Nutella\u2019.\n\nThe judge decided that it wouldn\u2019t be in the child\u2019s best interest to be named after a chocolate spread.\n\n\u201cThe name \u2018Nutella\u2019 given to the child is the trade name of a spread,\u201d the court\u2019s decision read, according to a translation.\n\n\u201cAnd it is contrary to the child\u2019s interest to be wearing a name like that can only lead to teasing or disparaging thoughts (sic).\u201d\n\nBack in the UK, a Welsh mother was banned by a high court from calling her baby twin daughter Cyanide (her brother was named Preacher).\n\nIn more positive baby naming news, last year the parents of a four-year-old boy were finally granted permission to name their son Yoda from the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 film franchise after an objection from the civil registry office and language council.", "description": "Apparently certain baby names are illegal.", "authors": ["Marie Claire Dorking"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/K3OYMleaHrpdkQGtbub9Dw--~B/aD0xNDE0O3c9MjEyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/8248cae0-f3f0-11e9-9d7e-dc201e175047", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
