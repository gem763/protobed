The was down less than 0.1% at 380.24 by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), while the U.K. was essentially unchanged and the German was up 0.2%.\n\nFor each of the last three years, Philips has raised its favored profit margin measure by at least 1 percentage point (it's been rewarded by a near-doubling of its shares price since mid-2016). CEO Frans van Houten said this year\u2019s improvement, by contrast, is going to be a meager 10-20 basis points instead (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percent). He promised to step up \u201cmitigating actions\u201d (read \u2013 \u2018cost cuts\u2019) to address the problem.\n\nThe shares were arguably ripe for a correction, having risen to a 19-year high this year. Even after the 9% drop, at 27 times trailing earnings, they still don\u2019t look cheap, and a dividend yield of barely 2% is hardly enough to tempt income investors.\n\nEven so, with the structural overhaul that Philips has achieved in the space of three years, van Houten has accumulated a lot of capital with investors, and its businesses still look healthy if one looks through the short-term noise around the trade war. Van Houten noted that \u201cgrowth momentum is still strong,\u201d and a 6% rise in currency-adjusted sales would seem to back that up. Order intake was flat against an exceptionally strong year-earlier period.\n\nIn that context, Thursday\u2019s drop could easily turn out to be a buying opportunity. The risk is that, if the trade talks in Washington break down, it could be just an invitation to catch a falling knife.\n\nThe same may well be said about a lot of stocks by the time the quarter\u2019s earnings season is over.", "description": "StockBeat: Philips Tariff Warning Presages a Bad 3Q Earnings Season", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECBE0EW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
