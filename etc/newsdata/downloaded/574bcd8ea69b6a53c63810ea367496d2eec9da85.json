Many are centered on new technology and forward-thinking concepts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to back these business and get out here and meet the actual entrepreneurs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people that we interview on the show are basically trying to save the environment, coming up with different ways that they can keep the Earth itself sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe \u201crappa-ternt-sanga\u201d (rapper-turned-singer), as he\u2019s labeled himself, said jumping into the business world was a natural fit; his mornings _ or afternoons, depending on when he wakes up _ consist of browsing crowdsourcing apps and helping fund businesses and ideas that catch his eye.\n\nPain\u2019s career is one that can be envied for its longevity, as many of the artists that he sparred with atop the music charts in the 2000s have faded into obscurity. He has consistently put out music, and he has kept his star bright by keeping his face on television. He won the inaugural \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d competition in February, followed by hosting the iHeart Music Awards in March. However, he doesn\u2019t label it as a comeback.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it resurgence. It\u2019s something I was already doing. I always meet TV producers and I always have meetings at networks and stuff like that and they\u2019re like, \u2018Man, you got a personality on you,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty relatable when it comes to learning about these things because I\u2019m learning with my audience, and if I\u2019m good enough to help people learn and help people start their own business, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nBut while he may not call it a revival, he\u2019s much more visible in pop culture than he has been in years. Despite touring and guest appearances, including a high-profile feature on \u201cFinish Line\u201d from Chance The Rapper\u2019s 2016 Grammy-winning \u201cColoring Book\u201d album, Pain hadn\u2019t had a solo song that charted Billboard since 2013. But that changed this year: He dropped a new project in March, \u201c1UP,\u201d and his track \u201cGirlfriend\u201d featuring G-Easy peaked at #37.\n\nHis music still serves as the sun in which all of his other interests orbit around. But to some hip-hop fans, it\u2019s a wonder his music still resonates: A decade ago, many predicted his career all but dead after Jay-Z released \u201cD.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)\u201d in 2009, a track urging the hip-hop world to stop using the effect after believing it had become oversaturated in pop culture.\n\nBut not only has his career thrived, his influence can be heard in the music of many of today\u2019s popular artists, such as Migos, Future, Travis Scott and Juice Wrld.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely come full circle. I\u2019m glad I can have such an influence now,\u201d said the \u201cBuy U A Drank\u201d singer. \u201cI see it in TV, I see it all over the place. I think what I do is infectious enough to go over industries: music industry, the TV industry and everything. So if I can spread T-Pain as much as possible, then absolutely _ I\u2019m here for it.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest irony might be that Beyonce, arguably the world\u2019s biggest music superstar _ and wife to Jay-Z _ used auto-tune on \u201cApe\u2026.,\u201d a track from the couple\u2019s 2018 Grammy-winning album, \u201cEverything Is Love.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt great. \u2026 It\u2019s hers. I don\u2019t think (Jay-Z) can tell her what to do anyway,\u201d he said with a hefty belly laugh.\n\nT-Pain\u2019s latest album boasts appearances from O.T. Genasis, Russ, Tory Lanez and frequent collaborator, Lil Wayne. He noted that he\u2019s been varied when it comes to his collaborations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dabbled in country, I\u2019ve written songs with Luke Bryan. I\u2019ve done that with Taylor Swift. I\u2019ve come back to do Pitbull, DJ Khaled and the most gangsta rappers, all the way to Christian pop.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t want there to be a specific sound or anything like that. You\u2019ll know my voice when you hear it.\u201d\n\nT-Pain recently wrapped up the first half of his \u201c1UP\u201d tour and he\u2019s preparing for the second leg that kicks off in November in Detroit. But these days, his priorities are different than years ago during the height of his musical success. His family, which includes his wife Amber of 16 years and their three children, Lyriq, Muziq and Kaydnz, is his main focus.\n\n\u201cThere was a big time in my career when I was chasing fame and chasing being No. 1 and having the best \u2018this\u2019 and doing the best \u2018that.\u2019 And in the end, none of that\u2019s important if your family is not behind you,\u201d he said. \u201cJust put your family first. It makes a world of difference. Trust me. Big difference.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at www.twitter.com/garyghamilton\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "T-Pain is not a fan of early mornings, but it\u2019s the price you pay when traveling the country to highlight entrepreneurs and startup companies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gary Gerard Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/t-pain_portrait_session_96841_c0-185-4432-2769_s1770x1032.jpg?36efe81ad2db89c0fa4d22c4d6bfd12470183418"}
