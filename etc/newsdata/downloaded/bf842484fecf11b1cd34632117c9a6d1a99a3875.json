However, it paid \u00a348.4 million ($61 million) to its US parent for intellectual property and other support services, up from \u00a31.7 million in 2017, contributing to its administrative expenses more than quadrupling to about \u00a3110 million.\n\nWeWork shelved its IPO last month after significant investor backlash due to its valuation, mushrooming losses, cofounder and now-former CEO Adam Neumann, and other issues. It is now scrambling to secure financing after missing out on an expected influx of cash from its flotation and funding tied to it.\n\nWage and salary expenses soared 150% to about \u00a331 million as average headcount more than doubled to 440. Interest payments jumped sixfold to \u00a34.9 million after borrowings nearly tripled to \u00a3300 million. Combined with the spike in administrative expenses, the upshot was pre-tax losses surged tenfold to \u00a376 million.\n\nWeWork International revealed a sharp rise in its investments in subsidiaries, from less than \u00a3500,000 to just over \u00a35 million. It also reported \u00a34.1 million in inventories, comprising \u00a31.2 million in leasehold improvements, \u00a32.9 million in furniture and equipment, and nearly \u00a3100,000 in computer equipment.\n\nIn a comment to Markets Insider on Thursday, WeWork said: \"WeWork International Limited is a services holding company that primarily exists to hold centralized set-up costs for UK and European operations, and receives revenues only as a small percentage of building profits, collected as a management fee. Its financial performance is therefore not a representation of the health and profitability of the overall UK business.\"\n\nRead more: 'The emperor has no clothes': Billionaire debt investor Howard Marks slammed WeWork's business model and valuation\n\nRead more: Salesforce's Mark Benioff was a big fan of WeWork's Adam Neumann \u2014 now he's changed his tune", "description": "Cash-strapped WeWork pulled nearly $60 million more from its UK subsidiary and lumped it with close to $240 million in extra debt in 2018.
