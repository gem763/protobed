You picked us up and because of you we\u2019re going to game seven\u2019,\u201d added Martinez, who was ejected late on after a disputed call.\n\nWashington\u2019s Juan Soto and Adam Eaton blasted solo home runs in the fifth inning and Houston native Rendon hit a two-run homer in the seventh and a two-run double in the ninth.\n\n\u201cRendon stepped up big,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nThat was enough run production for the Nationals thanks to Strasburg mystifying the Houston hitters who had produced 19 runs over the prior three games.\n\n\u201cI saw an incredible pitcher,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cHe was really good. We didn\u2019t put a lot of stress on him.\u201d\n\nMartinez became the first World Series ejection since 1996, needing to be restrained from angrily confronting umpires after a controversial call in the seventh inning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to criticize the umpires about anything,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to make this about me and take away from what the boys did. It was a judgement call. I don\u2019t want to make it about one play.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals, who improved to 4-0 in playoff elimination games this month, will start three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer in game seven after neck spasms kept him out of game five. Fellow right-hander Zack Greinke will start for Houston.\n\n\u201cWe have a great opportunity to play a game seven in the World Series in our ballpark,\u201d Hinch said.\n\nBut a World Series in which Houston was one of the heaviest favorites in years has turned into a historic epic, the first World Series with road teams winning the first six games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\n\nThe Astros will try for their second title in three seasons while the Nationals seek the first crown in their franchise\u2019s 50-year history.\n\nIt would also be the first World Series title for Washington since 1924.\n\nHouston\u2019s Justin Verlander, who won a season-best 21 games, surrendered three runs on five hits to suffer the loss and remain winless in seven career World Series starts, the most of any pitcher without a win. His 0-6 record is the all-time worst World Series mark.\n\n\u2013 Martinez ousted early \u2013\n\nWashington clung to a 3-2 lead in the seventh when controversy struck.\n\nNationals shortstop Trea Turner was called out for running inside the basepath and the decision was upheld after a 4 1/2-minute video review. It would cost Washington a run when Rendon smashed a homer to left field.\n\nAfter the inning, Martinez angrily moved toward the umpires, bench coach Chip Hale restraining him. But Martinez yelled until home plate umpire Sam Holbrook ejected him, leaving Hale to take the team to the finish.\n\nRendon\u2019s two-run homer put Washington ahead 5-2 and his two-run double in the ninth added more insurance runs.\n\nWashington took a 1-0 lead but Houston scored two off Strasburg in the first, George Springer hitting a double, taking third on a wild pitch and scoring on Jose Altuve\u2019s sacrifice fly before Alex Bregman hit a solo homer.\n\nMartinez said Strasburg had been tipping his pitches to Houston hitters in the first inning, giving clues as to his choices of fastballs, curves, sinkers or sliders.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re tipping you\u2019re pitches. We need to fix it,\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAfter that he was lights out.\u201d\n\nAfter Eaton and Soto homered for a 3-2 Nats lead, Houston threatened in the fifth when Josh Reddick singled and took third on another Springer double to left.\n\nBut Strasburg struck out Jose Altuve and Michael Brantley grounded out to end the inning.\n\nAltuve\u2019s 25-game streak of reaching base safely was ended by Strasburg\u2019s supreme effort.", "description": "Houston (AFP) \u2013 Stephen Strasburg baffled Houston\u2019s batters and Anthony Rendon drove in five runs to power the Washington Nationals over the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/fa3fd3_washington-stephen-strasburg-allowed-two-runs-on-hits-innings-as-nationals-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
