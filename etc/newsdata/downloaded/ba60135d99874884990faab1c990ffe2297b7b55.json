The decision was indicative of a growing federal effort to curtail the booming snake-oil business.\n\nAccording to Google\u2019s announcement, the platform will still allow companies to promote research and advertise clinical trials, explaining that it believes such work can lead to medical advancements.\n\nStill, Google has a long way to go to curb its spread of misleading medical advice. For instance, the announcement comes on the same day as a Vice report that Google Maps still directs people seeking abortions to pro-life clinics.", "description": "Google plans to crack down on ads for bogus medical treatments, as the company has observed a rise in predatory scams that target desperate patients....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Alex Cranz"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/k9gkftt8ozef0xwum7qd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
