The South Gauteng High Court granted the order of liquidation of Robor at the end of last month.\n\nIn June, Tiso Blackstar signed an agreement to sell its South African media, broadcasting and content businesses to Lebashe Investment Group for R800m. The sale would exclude Gallo and its South African radio assets, but includes publications like the Sunday Times, Business Day and Financial Mail.\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "Government dithering also may have contributed to its demise.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8848/92e6695eaae44388ae0af4f2e3243e1f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
