Can Campbell pull off a monumental upset? Or will Lomachenko dazzle and prove why he could well by the best fighter on the planet? Stay tuned for updates on an action-packed undercard. McGuigan on the test ahead for Campbell: \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be in a better place,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna always be hard to prepare for a guy as unique as Vasiliy Lomachenko. But I believe this is Lomachenko\u2019s hardest fight. You know, we\u2019re coming off the best form. \"He\u2019s huge for the weight. He could move up to 140. He has that big of a frame. \u2026 He\u2019s punching extremely hard and I believe he\u2019s at the peak of his career right now, Luke is. \"He\u2019s not the same guy he was when he boxed Jorge Linares. He\u2019s improved. He\u2019s learned from his losses. And I believe we\u2019re gonna pose the biggest threat to Lomachenko come Saturday night.\" Lomachenko enters tonight 13-1 with his last outing a one-sided knockout win over Anthony Crolla. Can Campbell put up more of a fight? Size is on the Hull man's side, but Lomachenko almost relishes that challenge and the greater target for his pin-point shots. Tonight's odds: Lomachenko: 1/12 - knockout 4/9, points 12/5 Campbell: 8/1 - knockout 12/1, points 22/1 Draw: 25/1 Advertisement Here is Savannah Marshall, she takes on Daniele Bastieri of Argentina. The Silent Assassin is 6-0 and will hope to take another step in her career here. Marshall now on top after the second round, moving well, light on her feet. Bastieri also unbeaten and not deterred by the power. Marshall rolling her shoulders nicely, the left hook tagging the Argentine often. Savannah Marshall stops Bastieri in the 5th round. Impressive enough from the Silent Assassin, who eventually landed cleaner and cleaner shots as the Argentine faded. She now moves to 7-0. Eddie Hearn maintains Luke Campbell has what it takes to upset Vasyl Lomachenko. \"All week it's been intense. I think Lomachenko means business, so does Luke Campbell. This is it,\" Hearn said. \"The greatest fighter in the world today is here, in Britain. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for British fight fans to see this, but it's not the Lomachenko show, we don't want to see him juggle balls. \"We want to see Luke Campbell knock him out tomorrow night and become a pound-for-pound star himself. \"Like I said, he's fighting the best fighter in the world, but he's here to win. He could have gone to America for this fight, could have made more money. He chose to take the fight in London, in the UK, because he believes he can win the fight.\" Advertisement Cordina vs Gwynne is underway!\n\nThis one doesn't take long to heat up, Cordina wipping in the left hook, but Gwynne marching forward. Cordina mixing it up with the jab though, nicely done bringing it downstairs. Bit more grappling as we enter the second. Gwynne again on the front foot, but taking a sharp jab often. Some vicious uppercuts being snuck in from Cordina now too, he's really warming up now. Cordina now wriggling free in the clinch and teeing off. A beautiful counter right lands as the third round ends. Very much in control here. Bit of early success for Gwynne to start the fourth as both fighters look to get the jab off first. Cordina with sharp movement off the back foot and pivoting nicely. He's being made to work hard. Advertisement Cordina hits the canvas in the sixth after stumbling and it seems to wake him up, firing away shots to prove he is on top. Gwynne still very much alive though and the pressure is impressive. Cordina's pop not quite enough to stop Gwynne marching forwards at will. Cordina with a point off in the seventh, it was a low shot! Gwynne opts against taking a longer break and is back in there. Cordina definitely treading a fine line with these body shots. Gwynne now going to the body in the ninth. Cordina tying him up as he comes in. Chopping right from Gwynne after landing his jab. Messy at times, this, with both fighters attempting shots behind the head as they clinch. Gwynne now has a point off for hitting behind the head. That's one apiece now. This has taken a lot out of both fighters. Prograis vs Taylor is ON! Josh Taylor will have his unification bout with Regis Prograis in the final of the WBSS. It's slated for October 26 in London. Advertisement Gwynne still plugging away, but Cordina still possessing some snap in his shots. He's probably done enough here, but he's been given a taxing 11 rounds so far. Impressive flurry from Cordina in the 12th. Venom in these combinations, which is impressive at this stage of the fight. He ought to have done enough here, but a good test for him with Gwynne putting up plenty of resistance. Cordina beats Gwynne by UD (116-110, 116-110, 116-111)\n\nMade to work for it, but in the end Cordina just a bit too sharp for Gwynne. Maybe lacking elite power, but Cordina's engine is impressive, plenty of snap right until the final bell. Buatsi up next!
