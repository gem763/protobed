BA -0.24% \u2019s 737 MAX jets, according to people briefed on the conclusions, while urging a wide-ranging reassessment of how complex automated systems should be certified on future airliners.\n\nAs part of roughly a dozen findings, these government and industry officials said, the task force is poised to call out the Federal Aviation Administration for what it describes as a lack of clarity and transparency in the way the FAA delegated authority to the plane maker to assess the safety of certain flight-control features. The upshot, according to some of these people, is that essential design changes didn\u2019t receive adequate FAA attention.\n\nThe report, these officials said, also is expected to fault the agency for what it describes as inadequate data sharing with foreign authorities during its original certification of the MAX two years ago, along with relying on mistaken industrywide assumptions about how average pilots would react to certain flight-control emergencies. FAA officials have said they are devising new pilot-reaction guidelines after two fatal crashes.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What changes would you like to see the FAA make in evaluating the safety of new airliners? Join the conversation below.\n\nExpected to be released in the next few weeks, the document would be the first official outside review of MAX certification since the fleet was grounded world-wide in March after the crashes. The planes nosedived after repeated misfires of an automated flight-control system, called MCAS, which pushed down the noses of both aircraft despite efforts by their pilots to pull the planes out of their steep dives.\n\nThe multiagency panel, created by the FAA in April and called the Joint Authorities Technical Review, is headed by Christopher Hart, former chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Tasked with examining procedures used to approve MAX flight-control systems, the participants also were asked for high-level recommendations to address systemic deficiencies. Members include air-safety regulators from Canada, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union, Brazil and the U.S.\n\nThe origin and makeup of the task force likely will give heft to its specific findings and recommendations for overhauling current practices and, in some cases, re-evaluating and updating decades-old safety rules and technical standards. Boeing and regulators are seeking to restore public confidence in the planes and end the grounding that has roiled the industry and disrupted global airline schedules.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the scrutiny of these experts,\u201d an FAA spokesman said Sunday in reference to the JATR and a number of other outside reviews examining MAX certification. The agency \u201cwill carefully review all the findings and recommendations,\u201d he added.\n\nA Boeing spokesman said the company looks forward to the finished report and \u201cis determined to keep improving on safety in partnership with the global aerospace industry,\u201d adding that the plane maker continues to cooperate with regulators to return the planes to service.\n\nDetails of the nearly finished report haven\u2019t been reported before. Final changes could modify some conclusions, according to some of the officials, but the overall thrust and recommendations for a sweeping reassessment aren\u2019t likely to shift.\n\nInitially, the panel was assembled by the FAA as part of a strategy to promote international consensus. But as Boeing\u2019s work to devise software fixes for MCAS and related systems dragged on\u2014and disagreements between the FAA and some of its foreign counterparts burst into public view\u2014the report has morphed. Now, it appears to have turned into more of a damage-control effort partly intended to sketch out longer-range changes in certification standards and procedures, industry officials said.\n\nThe JATR document won\u2019t analyze the accidents or proposed fixes to MCAS or changes to MAX flight-control computers. The FAA has stressed that the advisory group doesn\u2019t have veto power over modifications to MCAS.\n\nBut the report could influence changes to traditional engineering principles determining the safety of new aircraft models. Certification of software controlling increasingly interconnected and automated onboard systems \u201cis a whole new ballgame requiring new approaches,\u201d according to a senior industry safety expert who has discussed the report with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nGovernment approval of such systems requires not only vetting the reliability of essential software, but ensuring that average pilots can react promptly and appropriately to handle emergencies stemming from mechanical or computer malfunctions.\n\nThe panel, according to one of the officials, is expected to call for greater data-sharing and transparency among different governments, especially in certifying the safety of aircraft such as the MAX, whose basic designs are derived from earlier models.\n\nTwo crashes and the global grounding of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX commercial airliner led to extensive disruption in the international aerospace industry.

The FAA has spent months trying to ensure that MAX jets, once they are cleared to carry passengers again, will be phased in at roughly the same time across North America, Europe and other regions. Instead, various foreign authorities are setting their own testing protocols and timelines.\n\nEuropean regulators recently told their FAA counterparts they likely won\u2019t be ready to formally lift the grounding by early November, which remains the FAA\u2019s informal target.\n\nThe U.A.E. indicated over the weekend that it planned to follow its own, longer timetable. China and India, two fast-growing aviation markets, also are expected to take longer than the U.S.\n\nCanadian regulators, for their part, are signaling to the FAA they are likely to require simulator training for pilots before putting the MAX fleet registered in that country back in the air, according to one of the people briefed on the issue. That will require more time than the process the FAA is expected to mandate for U.S. aviators. A spokeswoman for Transport Canada had no comment.\n\nThe rift between the FAA and its foreign counterparts highlights the erosion of the U.S. agency\u2019s stature. For decades, the FAA has set the benchmark for aviation safety. It led the way with voluntary reporting of safety lapses, ways to analyze such data and concepts to tailor pilot training to real-world incidents and accidents.\n\nBut now, countries that relied on the FAA\u2019s help to emulate such advances are balking at accepting U.S. verifications regarding the MAX.\n\nPatrick Ky, head of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, told the European Parliament earlier this month, \u201cIt\u2019s very likely that international authorities will want a second opinion\u201d on any FAA decision to lift the grounding.\n\nEven after EASA gives the green light, agency officials are expected to push for significant additional safety enhancements to the fleet. Most prominently, EASA has proposed to eventually add to the MAX a third fully functional angle-of-attack sensor\u2014which effectively measures how far the plane\u2019s nose is pointed up or down\u2014underscoring the controversy expected to swirl around the plane for the foreseeable future.\n\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com", "description": "A panel of international air-safety regulators is finishing a report expected to criticize the initial U.S. approval of Boeing 737 MAX jets.", "authors": ["Andy Pasztor", "Andrew Tangel", "Andy.Pasztor Wsj.Com", "Andrew.Tangel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107276/social", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
