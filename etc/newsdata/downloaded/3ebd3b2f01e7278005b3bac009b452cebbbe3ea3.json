He has been a high-profile absentee from the ongoing Rugby World Cup in Japan.\n\nA statement released by the Tongan National Rugby League chairman George Koloamatangi on Monday indicated the 30-year-old Folau and his younger brother, John Folau, would play in the Oceania Cup in New Zealand against Britain on Oct. 26 and against Australia on Nov. 2.\n\nThe statement said the Folau brothers had registered with the Tongan NRL and \u201care eligible to play international rugby league fixtures.\u201d\n\nFolau is taking legal action against Rugby Australia, alleging restraint of trade over his ban from Super Rugby and international rugby union, the traditional 15-a-side game.\n\nThe National Rugby League, which governs the 13-a-side version of rugby in Australia, has previously said it would not re-register Folau because of his rugby union ban.\n\nIsrael Folau played for the Melbourne Storm and Brisbane Broncos in the NRL. He represented Australia in rugby league before a stint playing Australian rules football and eventually rugby union.\n\nTonga coach Frank Endacott welcomed the potential selection of the Folau brothers for the international matches.\n\n\u201cThese guys are great footballers and bring size, pace and skill to the team,\u201d Endacott said. \u201cThey will make a huge impact in the team and provide exciting attack options all over the park.\n\n\u201cThis will be great boost to the internationals, and I can\u2019t wait to see the crowd support that this will generate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Tongan NRL statement sparked immediate headlines in the Australian media, where Folau\u2019s ban has polarized opinion.\n\nIn a social media post, Folau listed gay people among a group of sinners whom he said would face damnation unless they repented.\n\nFolau, who was born in Australia to Tongan parents, had previously been warned after a similar post during Australia\u2019s national debate over the legalization of gay marriage. Folau, who describes himself as a devout Christian, said he was referencing the bible.\n\nFolau was an undisputed star in his 73 test matches for the Wallabies after joining the rugby union ranks in 2013. He has the record for most tries by any player in the Super Rugby tournament.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Banned rugby star Israel Folau is planning on making a return to international rugby league with Tonga.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
