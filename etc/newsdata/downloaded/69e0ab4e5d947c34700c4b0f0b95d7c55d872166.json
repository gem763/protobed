Foster tweeted that the party would not accept any barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and described the story as \"nonsense.\"\n\nEven if the DUP did drop this particular red line, a deal on replacing the backstop would likely still be a long way off.\n\nThe Times report adds that the DUP will not accept any deal which would keep Northern Ireland in a customs union with the EU, and that the party wants \"alternative arrangements\" to deal with new customs checks.\n\nRead more: These business owners on the Irish border fear a no-deal Brexit could soon wreck their livelihoods\n\nRead more: 'The guns are back out again': Northern Ireland fears a Brexit border will escalate violence\n\nHowever, the EU has repeatedly said that the technology needed to carry out such checks without the need for physical infrastructure does not exist. Brussels is pushing for a backstop under which the province would stay in the customs union and follow swathes of single market rules until alternative means of preserving the border are ready.\n\nPlus, Johnson's suggestion of an arrangement covering agri-food goods excludes an array of other goods which cross the Irish border, and would require checks in the absense of an agreement.\n\nIt's also unclear whether a Brexit deal based a Northern Ireland-only backstop would get through Parliament.\n\nNumerous pro-Brexit Conservative MPs in the European Research Group have demanded that Johnson scraps the entire Withdrawal Agreement, not just the backstop for Northern Ireland.", "description": "The Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Johnson's minority government, is reportedly prepared to relax its Brexit red lines to agreeing a deal.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7b51be2e22af13ee757214-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
