The raid against Baghdadi was named for her.", "language": "en", "text": "In a letter to her family that she wrote while in captivity, she urged her loved ones not to let her situation burden them. \u201cI DO NOT want the negotiations for my release to be your duty,\u201d she wrote, adding: \u201cI know you would want me to remain strong. That is exactly what I am doing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI remember mom always telling me that all in all in the end the only one you really have is God. I have come to a place in experience where, in every sense of the word, I have surrendered myself to our creator,\u201d she wrote, invoking her religious beliefs throughout the letter.\n\nIn February 2015, the Islamic State claimed that Mueller was killed when a Jordanian fighter plane bombed the building in which she was being held. U.S. officials expressed skepticism about the claim, while the Jordanian government denied its airstrikes had killed the American hostage.\n\nThe details surrounding Mueller\u2019s death and the whereabouts of her body are still unclear.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken to share that we\u2019ve received confirmation that Kayla Jean Mueller has lost her life,\u201d her parents said in a statement in 2015.\n\nIn remarks on Sunday, President Trump described in detail the operation that killed Baghdadi, saying that he \u201cdied like a dog\u201d and that he blew himself up in a \u201cdead-end tunnel\u201d as U.S. troops moved in on him and three of his children.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking to the Arizona Republic on Sunday, Mueller\u2019s parents praised Trump\u2019s handling of the raid and expressed hope they would one day find out more about what happened to their daughter.\n\n\u201cI still want to know, \u2018Where is Kayla?\u2019 and what truly happened to her, and what aren\u2019t we being told,\u201d Mueller\u2019s mother, Marsha, told the newspaper.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI still say Kayla should be here, and if [President Barack] Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\u201d she added. The Muellers have been critical of the Obama administration in the past, telling ABC News in 2016 that it took over 17 months for Obama to follow up on his promise to donate money to the Kayla\u2019s Hands foundation.\n\n\u201cThe president could have been a hero, but he chose not to be,\u201d Mueller\u2019s father, Carl, told ABC News.\n\nAD\n\nCarl Mueller told the Republic it was \u201cimportant\u201d to him that Trump was aware of his daughter\u2019s story and it was clear to him that the president had been briefed on it. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him [Trump] from getting this guy,\u201d Carl Mueller said, adding he had faith that Trump would continue to target others like Baghdadi.\n\nAD\n\nDescribing his daughter\u2019s ordeal at the hands of the Islamic State, Mueller\u2019s father said, \u201cShe was held in many prisons. She was held in solitary confinement. She was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself.\"\n\nIn 2016, federal prosecutors offered more details about the abuse that Kayla Mueller is said to have faced in captivity when they charged an Iraqi woman with playing a role in her imprisonment. Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar, also known as Umm Sayyaf, told FBI agents that Mueller and other captives were kept in locked rooms and sometimes handcuffed. The affidavit indicates Mueller was made to watch disturbing Islamic State propaganda videos and was raped by Baghdadi.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking to NBC News on Sunday, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien described Baghdadi as a \u201cbrutal, vicious terrorist\u201d and said the United States had finally brought to justice a man with a history of killing Americans, including journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.\n\nCalling Mueller a \u201cgreat young American,\u201d O\u2019Brien said it was Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who decided to name the operation that killed Baghdadi after her.\n\nAD", "description": "The details surrounding Mueller\u2019s 2015 death and the whereabouts of her body are still unclear.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BODCEXKfY8l6Dr0XXa5JBuIPRMo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JYL6H6HZWAI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
