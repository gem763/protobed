But observers of Cuban and Russian foreign policy say there is a significant warming between the former partners, prompted in part by the Trump administration\u2019s reversal of President Barack Obama\u2019s opening to Cuba.\n\nCuba and Russia are also heavily supporting Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom the U.S. has been trying to overthrow.\n\nSpeaking to Putin, D\u00edaz-Canel said his government considers developing ties with Russia its top priority and hailed a recent visit by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. \u201cWe observe the growing role of Russia that resists the U.S. attempts at domination,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Cuban leader on Tuesday also met separately with Medvedev for talks on boosting economic ties.\n\nRussian-Cuban trade has more than doubled since 2013, to an expected $500 million this year, mostly in Russian exports to Cuba. Over the past year Russia has sent Cuba 1,000 minibuses, 50 locomotives, tens of thousands of tourists and a promise to upgrade the island\u2019s power grid with a multimillion-dollar improvement plan.\n\nNeither country provides many details about their improving relations, but Russian products being exported to Cuba include new-model Lada automobiles and Kamaz trucks. There\u2019s a new Cuban-Russian joint venture to produce construction materials, and when Medvedev visited Cuba this month, he inaugurated a petroleum products plant and signed deals to repair three Soviet-era power plants.\n\nAs tourism from the U.S. slackens, Russian visits rose 30% in 2018, to 137,000.\n\n\u201cRussia is trying to preserve the zone of influence it had during the era of the Soviet Union, looking for partners in Latin America and letting Washington know that it\u2019s still a great power,\u201d said Arturo L\u00f3pez-Levy, a Cuban-born assistant professor of international relations and politics at Holy Names University in Oakland, California. \u201cCuba\u2019s signing up for projects that can benefit it, and are already showing results on the island.\u201d\n\nRussia is making no secret of its desire to play reliable partner to an island facing hostility from the United States, including sanctions on ships bringing oil from Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe did make huge mistakes in the 1990s while turning our backs on Cuba. That time is definitely over, and I\u2019m absolutely sure that our relations deserve better attention from Russia,\u201d said Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament.\n\n\u201cThey deserve more investments from Russia both in terms of finances and equipment of course, but also human resources. And definitely we should assist, we should help, Cuba; we should support Cuba as long as it\u2019s discriminated against, as long as it\u2019s sanctioned, as long as it\u2019s blockaded by the United States.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and \u201980s, Cuba was filled with Soviet products and citizens, who worked alongside Cubans in chemical plants, mines and army bases. Moscow sent billions in aid before the fall of the Soviet Union caused a disastrous 30% drop in gross domestic product.\n\nCuba emerged with $35 billion in debt to the Soviet Union, 90 percent of which Russia forgave in 2014, an event that Cuban-Russian anthropologist Dmitri Prieto Sams\u00f3nov called the start of the modern era of relations between the two countries.\n\n\u201cRussia started to think more about its business and government interests and a new relationship with Cuba emerged on the foundation of the old brotherly relations,\u201d Prieto said.\n\n___\n\nAndrea Rodr\u00edguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP\n\n___\n\nRodriguez reported from Havana.", "description": "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Cuba's resilience in the face of U.S. pressure as he hosted his Cuban counterparts for talks Tuesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/6440ab_russia-cuba-09993-russian-president-vladimir-putin-cuban-president-miguel-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
