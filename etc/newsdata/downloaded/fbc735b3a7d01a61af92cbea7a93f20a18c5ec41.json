The shy schoolboy who touched a fellow pupil on the arm and waist as he tried to talk to her in the street has been sentenced.\n\nAfter being found guilty in a Manchester court of two charges of sexual assault, Griffiths was ordered to pay her \u00a3250 compensation and complete a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work.\n\nHe also has to sign the Sex Offender Register for the next five years \u2014 his real punishment.\n\nIt still seems a rather harsh price to pay for a bumbling, adolescent attempt at friendship; for the physical expression of the inarticulate speech of the teenage heart. He was trying to make a friend, he told the court, \u2018but the words didn\u2019t come out\u2019.\n\nAs his accuser melts back into the comforting shadows of anonymity, Griffiths, 19, must bear this stain on his character for the rest of his life, with a conviction that may disqualify him from many sectors of employment.\n\nHe may have been foolhardy, he may have been clumsy \u2014 and possibly may still be a risk \u2014 but he is hardly Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nOne can only imagine how this verdict strikes a chill into the souls of those mothers and fathers who must try to shepherd their shy boys taking their first hopeful steps towards love and romance in this febrile atmosphere.\n\nFor Griffiths\u2019s chief crime seems to have been pimply gaucherie, not dark intent.\n\nConsider his sentence with the recent case involving Paul Gascoigne. After kissing a woman on a train last year, the former England footballer has just been found not guilty of sexual assault.\n\nGascoigne said he was only trying to cheer up the woman after someone in the carriage called her fat.\n\nIf he was so concerned about her emotional well-being, why didn\u2019t he remonstrate with her fat-shaming tormentor instead of pressing his foolish, booze-sodden lips upon hers?\n\nIf chivalry was his aim, that would surely have been the goal.\n\nGascoigne is a grown-up, a man of the world, a father and former husband. Yes, he is fragile and pathetic in equal measure, but how can he kiss a stranger on the lips without consent and be cleared, while this hapless teenager is found guilty?\n\nThe answer seems to lie with motive and intent \u2014 and also the desperate attempts of courts not to look out of touch in this post #MeToo world.\n\nThe judge in Jamie Griffiths\u2019s case told him; \u2018We can think of no motivation for you to touch the victim other than sexual.\u2019\n\nThe verdict in Paul Gascoigne\u2019s case seemed to hinge on his celebrity insistence that he was only trying to help, that there was no sexual intent.\n\nMaybe the very fact that she was \u2018a fat lass\u2019 helped his case \u2014 shameful if true.\n\nYet who can accurately divine intent in these delicate circumstances?\n\nTruly, it is hard not to surmise that things would have been better for all involved if both females had said: \u2018Get off me, you idiot,\u2019 and then got on with their lives.\n\nNot that any woman should have to put up with a man laying a hand on her person without her consent, but a sense of perspective wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Cases such as these make one wonder if the #MeToo movement, two years old this week, has gone too far. On the positive side, it has made it easier for women (and men) to speak out about sexual harassment.\n\nAnd it has made some men think not once, not twice, but thrice before laying a clammy hand on a comely knee.\n\nBut it has also made some women feel that flirtation and speculative physical contact are an offence on a par with serious sexual assault and rape.\n\nToday, fear and mistrust flourish among the sexes like never before. What our grandparents innocently called courting is now a war zone, full of traps, pitfalls and suspicions.\n\nJamie Griffiths had Googled \u2018how to make a friend\u2019 and then plotted to come into contact with his fellow pupil during two attempts to engage her in conversation. It is perfectly understandable how she could have been frightened or felt that she was being stalked.\n\nShe told police that Griffiths would have touched her breast had she not moved away from him \u2014 but how can she be sure?\n\nCourt reports detailed the effect on her well-being, which was extensive. Her school work suffered, she was unable to sit her mock exams, she became stressed and anxious and felt unsafe in her own home.\n\nIn addition, she was constantly tearful, unable to walk anywhere alone and the incident had hindered her application to Oxford. \u2018It has affected my grades and potentially my future,\u2019 she said in a statement. Well, not quite as much as it is going to affect his.\n\nGriffiths was socially inept and immature, and has received counselling in relation to anxiety and depression. Reading between the lines, he was not the only person involved who was in a fragile emotional state, yet there is no clemency for him.\n\nThis is a sorry tale of our times and another indication that it is time for a complete overhaul of sex offence prosecutions.\n\nIn real life, important nuances exist between flirtation and assault, between affection and attack. And that should be reflected in the courts, too.\n\nCarly's so vain to intrude on Jackie O's death\n\nCarly Simon has always been a goddess to me. However, now that she has published a book about her acquaintance with Jackie Kennedy, I am glad I\u2019m not her friend.\n\nIn Touched By The Sun: My Friendship With Jackie, the singer details the former First Lady\u2019s thoughts about both her husbands \u2014 Jack Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis. She didn\u2019t mind about Jack\u2019s affairs, apparently, while Onassis was \u2018sexy\u2019.\n\nWell, fair enough. But did we really need to hear intimate details about Jackie\u2019s deathbed scene, as she passed away from non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1994?\n\nSimon chronicles everything, from the paisley scarf on Jackie\u2019s head, to the Gregorian chant playing on the sound system, and her son John F. Kennedy Jr praying at the foot of her bed while a noisy Irish wake took place next door.\n\nTwo things: 1) Wakes only start when the deceased is dead, as my Irish friend always says.\n\nAnd 2) As both Jackie and John Jnr are now dead, you might think these kinds of intimate revelations don\u2019t matter any more. But they do. Some things should remain sacred, even after death.\n\nThe question NO woman should be asked\n\nRecently married Ellie Goulding says she finds it invasive when people ask her when she is going to have children. She is right, it is invasive. Horribly so. Yet people ask young wives this question with impunity. It may be asked with all innocence and every good will, but it is still insensitive.\n\nPregnancy is personal and intimate. You never know what difficulties or heartbreak couples might be going through, or find themselves in circumstances where it is painful to be asked.\n\nSo let us desist in trying to harness the bootee booty. It\u2019s not our business!\n\nEllie Goulding, pictured, says she finds it invasive when she is constantly asked when she and her husband are going to have a child\n\nMr Marr was Priti rude to Miss Patel\n\nAndrew Marr has now apologised to Priti Patel for accusing her of \u2018laughing\u2019 in an interview about Brexit on his TV show. And so he should.\n\nI do think that the Home Secretary has an odd, Mona Lisa-ish expression which suggests a smile when none is present. Her impenetrable countenance is reminiscent of the blue dress/gold dress internet conundrum, where people see different things in the same image.\n\nMe? I saw a woman who was concentrating on what Marr was saying to her \u2014 and not smirking in the slightest.\n\nAndrew Marr has now apologised to Priti Patel for accusing her of \u2018laughing\u2019 in an interview about Brexit on his TV show\n\nI can't applaud these softy students\n\nOh, students. What are we going to do with you? Those at Oxford University have passed a motion to \u2018ban clapping\u2019 because it \u2018could trigger anxiety\u2019. Clapping will now be replaced by \u2018jazz hands\u2019 \u2014 but isn\u2019t that cultural appropriation and, quite possibly, even racially insulting? Meanwhile, their peers at Bristol\u2019s University of the West of England have gone mad because they hate the new accommodation pods introduced there to solve an acute housing shortage.\n\nThe tiny 8 x 10 ft (2.4 x 3 m) pods have been branded \u2018appalling\u2019 and \u2018not mentally viable\u2019 by those living there. They might have a point \u2014 I have seen more luxurious stables.\n\nBut am I wrong to feel that the students won\u2019t be entirely happy unless they are supplied with a Friends-style apartment, complete with butler service?\n\nRadio 2 dropped the Ball with Zoe\n\nIt is hard not to conclude that Zoe Ball got the prestigious gig by gender default, and not because she is the best person for the job\n\nFor the third consecutive quarter, Zoe Ball\u2019s listening figures have gone down, down, down.\n\nAfter taking over the Radio 2 Breakfast Show from Chris Evans earlier this year, Zoe\u2019s audience is disappearing down the great radio plughole, gurgling merrily as it goes.\n\nThe latest figures show a 364,000 drop, which takes the number of lost listeners to nearly a million in less than 12 months.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Zoe is a bad broadcaster \u2014 although, personally, I\u2019d rather pass my ears through a cheese grater than listen to her inane early-morning burblings, all right babes?\n\nHowever, with the best will in the world, it is hard not to conclude that Zoe Ball got the prestigious gig by gender default, and not because she is the best person for the job.\n\nAnd that Radio 2 continues to pursue a risky strategy by chasing a younger audience while ignoring its core older listeners. Like me.\n\nIn the same spirit, can we have a new set of rules regarding this year\u2019s imminent BBC Children In Need \u2014 and any other celebrity charity telethon?\n\nEvery year, very, very rich people climb aboard the charity bandwagon to urge considerably poorer people to donate to the cause. Fair enough, for it is always a very worthy cause. However, in the interests of transparency, I would like to know what they are donating, too.\n\nSo why don\u2019t we have a Strictly Come Dancing-style Children In Need leaderboard detailing the contributions from all presenters and celebrity guests? It\u2019s the least those ordinary people, who dig deep year after year, deserve.\n\nSwedish academics have identified ten famous people who are super-emitters. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but it\u2019s not that. They are the celebrities whose globetrotting and carbon footprints reveal them to be super-polluters. They include Paris Hilton, Oprah Winfrey and Emma Watson. No more proselytising about climate change from them, please, if you don\u2019t mind, thanks all the same.", "description": "Jamie Griffiths has now learned his fate.
