Biden likely pressured Ukrainian officials to stop investigating his son\u2019s business ties to a Ukrainian energy company, according to a Monmouth University Poll released this week.\n\nThe survey, published Wednesday, found 43 percent of the individuals questioned last month believed President Trump\u2019s allegation that Mr. Biden used his status as vice president to get a prosecutor fired who had been investigating his son Hunter Biden\u2019s interests in a Ukrainian company, which paid him about $50,000 a month. Defenders of the president say Mr. Biden\u2019s son had no expertise in Ukraine or energy.\n\nJust 37 percent of the individuals polled said Mr. Biden \u201cprobably did not\u201d pressure Ukrainian officials.\n\nWhen quizzing independent voters, the numbers show 39 percent do believe Mr. Trump\u2019s allegation, while 27 percent do not.\n\n\u201cThe fact that 4-in-10 independents are inclined to believe what they have heard from Trump is a warning sign for the Biden campaign. How the candidate fights back against this charge will be crucial to his argument of electability,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\n\nThe survey questioned 1,017 registered voters from Sept. 23-29 and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
