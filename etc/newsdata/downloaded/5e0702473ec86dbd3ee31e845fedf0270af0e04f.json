Less than a third of the British public have \u201clooked for information on how to prepare for Brexit\u201d, it adds.\n\nThe document says the government \u201cwill ramp up activity for key target audiences\u201d, but does not specify when.\n\nQuick guide Why is the Irish border a stumbling block for Brexit? Show Hide Counties and customs Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.\n\nBritain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 taking Northern Ireland with it \u2013 risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety. The 'backstop' in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a 'trap' to keep the UK in the EU's customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals. There are an estimated 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and about 14% of those crossings are consignments of goods, some of which may cross the border several times before they reach a consumer. Brexit supporters say this can be managed by doing checks on goods away from the border, but critics say it will be difficult to police this without any physical infrastructure like border posts of cameras, which could raise tensions in the divided communities of Ireland.

Time is desperately short and we are still being kept in the dark.\n\n\u201cWhat are we supposed to be planning for? We need to know the potential impacts, but they haven\u2019t told us what to look out for. We cannot make plans if they don\u2019t tell us. It\u2019s all political smoke and mirrors. This document indicates the government has no grasp on the details of the response.\u201d\n\nAnother source said mixed messages from the government, and the lack of clarity from ministers, was making emergency planning on the ground incredibly difficult.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of frustration. Everything is getting more and more complicated. We still don\u2019t know what the hell is happening. Nobody does. Nothing has been ironed out.\u201d\n\nThe Local Government Association said its members were working \u201ctirelessly\u201d to prepare for the end of October, but that they needed more guidance from the centre.\n\n\u201cThere remains information and advice gaps that councils are facing while helping their communities prepare, which need to be met by the government,\u201d said Kevin Bentley, chairman of the LGA\u2019s Brexit taskforce.\n\n\u201cCouncils also need certainty to plan for their communities over the longer term, such as on the domestic replacement for EU funding.\u201d\n\nThe document was prepared by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MCHLG) and is titled \u201cHMG Top Lines\u201d.\n\nThough it was prepared by civil servants, it begins by stating categorically: \u201cThe UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October whatever the circumstances. If it is not possible to reach a deal we will have to leave with no deal.\n\nQ&A What is a customs union? Show Hide A customs union means that countries agree to apply no or very low tariffs to goods sold between them, and to collectively apply the same tariffs to imported goods from the rest of the world. International trade deals are then negotiated by the bloc as a whole. For the EU, this means deals are negotiated by by Brussels, although individual member state governments agree the mandate and approve the final deal. The EU has trade deals covering 69 countries, including Canada and South Korea, which the UK has been struggling to roll over into post-Brexit bilateral agreements. Proponents of an independent UK trade policy outside the EU customs union say Britain must forge its own deals if it is to take advantage of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies. However they have never explained why Germany manages to export more than three times the value in goods to China than Britain does, while also being in the EU customs union. Jennifer Rankin\n\n\u201cThe government is committed to preparing for this outcome. We are better prepared than many think but not as well prepared as we can be.\u201d\n\nThe document states: \u201cWe will ensure that there is as little disruption to national life as possible, whatever the circumstances after Brexit. With the kind of national effort our people have made before \u2013 and will make again \u2013 we believe that is possible.\u201d\n\nIt goes on to say that the government is \u201cundertaking a review of the reasonable worst-case scenario planning assumptions \u2026 and will publish the revised version in due course\u201d.\n\nAside from the lack of detail or explanation about how this would be achieved, some planners are said to have been riled by the language being used, saying it seemed overtly and unnecessarily political given it was prepared by civil servants rather than ministers.\n\nWhitehall sources said it was drafted to give emergency planners an insight into government thinking.\n\nA spokesperson for MCHLG said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on leaks. We\u2019re working very closely with local resilience forums to support them in their preparations to ensure we will be fully ready for Brexit on 31 October, whether we leave with or without a deal.\u201d", "description": "Planners exasperated over lack of detail in confidential document sent on 26 September", "authors": ["Nick Hopkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593bc9af1d8f20d2ee30d5f7ee70ec34e80dd188/0_4_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3815cda3f63987ca9b36fd72c0f1de9", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
