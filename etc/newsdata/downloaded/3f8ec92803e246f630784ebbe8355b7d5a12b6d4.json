The British Airways Boeing 747 was not yet capable of making the 6,000-mile journey nonstop. Instead, to reach the Far East you flew west to Anchorage and west again to the Japanese capital. The distance was almost 8,000 miles. But even that was shorter than my trip this week from Heathrow to Tokyo via Dubai.\n\nDuring the four-hop journey, which involved a total of 35 hours in the sky, I had plenty of time to notice 10 things about flying on Emirates, and I want to pass them on to you.\n\nCheck in\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe ideal time to turn up at check-in for an Emirates flight is 70 minutes before departure. That worked fine for me at Heathrow on the way out \u2013 the less time you spend at an airport, the better, so plan to get there just before check-in closes.\n\nComing back from Tokyo Haneda airport I made the mistake of arriving two hours ahead, and encountered a long queue even for passengers who had checked in online and wanted only to drop bags. So I wandered off, had a drink and returned 10 minutes before the desks closed to find them deserted \u2013 except by the check-in staff, fortunately.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I was in row 83, downstairs in the Airbus A380 Super Jumbo. Dinner did not arrive until just before 10.30pm. We were over Hungary and I was over-hungry.\n\nDrinks\n\nEmirates does not serve spirits in economy. I think a simple choice of white or red wine, served from full bottles, not miniatures, is sufficient. No one seemed to over-imbibe. But if you are the sort of person for whom an inflight G&T is an essential part of the trip, you will disagree.\n\nEnrol\n\nJoin Emirates Skywards, the airline\u2019s frequent-flyer scheme. On a long-haul trip with a budget fare, you\u2019re unlikely to amass enough points for an upgrade, let alone a \u201cfree\u201d flight. But it gets you a discount on the paid inflight internet \u2013 \u00a39 buys access for the whole flight.\n\nPlug in\n\nTo keep powered up, Emirates is a good choice. The carrier has mains electricity at most seats, and you can no doubt borrow your neighbour\u2019s socket if your laptop is lacking juice. Most aircraft are configured for the standard British plug, which is the same as the standard UAE plug. But on some older Boeing 777s, you will need a two-pin adapter.\n\n\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Tokyo Story Show all 2 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Tokyo Story 1/2 2/2 1/2 2/2\n\nElbows in\n\nA full Airbus A380 is more agreeable than a full Boeing 777, at least in Emirates\u2019 configuration. The interior cabin width on the main deck of the Airbus is two feet wider than that of the Boeing \u2013 yet the seats are 10 abreast on both aircraft. The London-Dubai service was on the Airbus, but the 50 per cent longer Dubai-Tokyo flight was on a Boeing.\n\nChoose carefully\n\nEmirates flies to both Tokyo airports: Narita (with an A380) and Haneda (with a 777). Despite the tighter squeeze, choose Haneda \u2013 access to the capital is a 15-minute joyride on a monorail, rather than the 40-mile slog from Narita.\n\nStretch out\n\nIf you want to be on a non-full Airbus A380, the last Emirates flight of the afternoon from Dubai to Heathrow is the one to go for in terms of comfort.\n\nBetween 2.15pm and 3.45pm, four London flights leave Dubai within 90 minutes: two to Heathrow, and one each to Gatwick and Stansted.\n\nI surmised that the load would be lightest on the last flight. It arrives mid-evening at Heathrow (8.15pm in theory, 8.30pm in reality due to missing passengers in Dubai).\n\nThat is too late for flight connections for destinations such as Belfast and Dublin. And by the time formalities have been completed, overland transport options have dwindled. So at least downstairs in economy, passengers should have been assigned seats based on their height: four seats for taller travellers to stretch out on, three seats for shorter people.\n\nSpeaking to another passenger across an uncrowded cabin, it appears that the 9.05am in the opposite direction is the one to catch for a similarly tranquil experience.\n\nExplore Dubai\n\nIf you have a gap of a few hours between flights at Emirates\u2019 hub, and it\u2019s daytime, the Dubai Metro is an excellent way to get a glimpse into the past. It is easily accessible from Emirates\u2019 Terminal 3.\n\nBuy a two-zone ticket (8 dirhams), change at Union station and alight at Al Ghubaiba \u2013 the station for the heritage area, as well as the shining Sixties ship, the QE2. Then take an abra (small, open ferry) across the Dubai Creek for 1 dirham, explore the Gold Souk and hop on a train back to the airport (one zone, 6 dirhams) from Al Ras station.\n\nKeep straight\n\nWhen planning a trip, don\u2019t be beguiled by Mercator\u2019s Projection. This two-dimensional representation of a spherical planet makes London via Dubai to Tokyo look a plausibly direct routing. In fact, by the time you touch down in the UAE, after a flight of seven hours and more than 3,400 miles, you are only 1,000 miles closer to Tokyo. The total distance is around 8,300 miles.\n\nAs I had places to go and people to see in Dubai, that was just fine. But if you simply want get from Britain to Japan \u2013 and don\u2019t want to pay hundreds of pounds extra for the privilege of a nonstop flight \u2013 it would be kinder on your body and the environment to route yourself via Helsinki, adding just a few miles to the journey.", "description": "When first I travelled to Tokyo, in the 1980s, it involved a trip to Alaska.
