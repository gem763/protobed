Five Kmarts and 21 Sears stores are scheduled to shut their doors between late October and mid-November. This decision followed the company's move to close a handful of stores quietly over the past few months.\n\nAs it turns out, that was just the tip of the iceberg. By the end of August, Transform Holdco had initiated the store-closing process for about 100 more locations, according to USA Today. That action suggests that the Sears and Kmart chains could be close to collapsing entirely. That would put billions of dollars of sales up for grabs by competitors, ranging from J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) to Target (NYSE: TGT).\n\nThe pace of store closures accelerates again\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, Sears Holdings operated about 1,000 stores between the Sears and Kmart nameplates. The remnant that survived bankruptcy was less than half that size. The store closures announced just since the beginning of August will leave the two chains with fewer than 300 full-line stores combined.\n\nThe official store-closing announcement in early August mainly targeted Sears stores. A company statement indicated that the move was part of a broader shift to a strategy centered on small-format stores with a limited merchandise assortment. Transform Holdco has agreed to buy Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores -- or at least the Hometown portion of the company -- which will instantly widen its geographic reach. Sears Hometown stores primarily sell appliances, tools, and lawn and garden supplies -- merchandise categories in which Sears still competes relatively well.\n\nThe exterior of a Sears full-line store More\n\nSears and Kmart have been closing full-line stores at a rapid pace. Image source: Sears.\n\nBy contrast, more than 80 of the roughly 100 locations marked for closure later in the month were Kmarts. This move has nothing to do with a shift to small-format stores. It simply marks a retreat from the soft goods, grocery, and pharmacy categories that account for the bulk of Kmart's sales.\n\nThe beginning of the end\n\nThis massive wave of store closures is a clear signal that bankruptcy didn't solve the underlying problems at Sears and Kmart. If more proof is needed, Transform Holdco is slashing its headquarters staff to the bone, keeping on just enough staff to carry out the essential tasks needed to stay in business.\n\nIt's not surprising that Sears and Kmart are in a downward spiral, considering that comparatively stronger chains like J.C. Penney are also on the rocks. Certain retailers -- like Target -- are gaining market share rapidly, thanks to a combination of low prices, compelling products, well-designed stores, and convenient pickup and delivery options. Others, like Sears, Kmart, and J.C. Penney, are struggling to adapt to changing consumer behavior.\n\nIn recent years, management often claimed that closing unprofitable Sears and Kmart stores would make the chains stronger in the long run. That's no longer a plausible argument. What's left of the Sears and Kmart chains is too small to be viable in today's competitive environment. Adding a bunch of small-format Sears stores won't change that, either.\n\nJ.C. Penney's last chance to gain some market share", "description": "Bankruptcy didn't fix the underlying problems at these two iconic chains.", "authors": ["Adam Levine-Weinberg", "The Motley Fool"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a8A0iRREAl.DT1WdevMPMQ--~B/aD01MTE7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/motleyfool.com/6f1961484b7cae8c9b396b1da81c6d60", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
