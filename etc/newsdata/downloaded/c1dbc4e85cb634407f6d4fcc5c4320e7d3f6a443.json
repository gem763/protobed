So, you know, for payments, that level - it's ours and Apple's.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, BBC News tested the Face Unlock feature on the new Pixel 4.\n\nUsing the default settings, the phone still unlocked if the user pretended to be asleep.\n\nThe test was repeated on several people, with the same result.\n\nImages of the Pixel 4 leaked before launch showed a setting labelled: \"Require eyes to be open,\" in the facial-recognition menu.\n\nHowever, this setting was not present on the devices loaned to BBC News.\n\nAnd Google told BBC News it would not feature on the Pixel 4 when it went on sale, on 24 October.\n\n\"If someone can unlock your phone while you're asleep, it's a big security problem,\" said cyber-security expert Graham Cluley.\n\n\"Someone unauthorised - a child or partner? - could unlock the phone without your permission by putting it in front of your face while you're asleep,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"I wouldn't trust it to secure the private conversations and data on my phone.\"\n\nGoogle's Pixel 4 support website tells customers: \"Your phone can also be unlocked by someone else if it's held up to your face, even if your eyes are closed.\"\n\nIt says concerned customers can switch on \"lockdown\" mode - which deactivates facial recognition - when they want enhanced security.\n\nGoogle told BBC News Face Unlock could not be fooled by photos or masks, however.\n\n\"We will continue to improve Face Unlock over time,\" it said in a statement.", "description": "Google confirms its new security system may unlock a person's device even if their eyes are shut.", "authors": ["Chris Fox", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/741F/production/_109272792_img_6043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
