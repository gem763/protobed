I\u2019m vegetarian so I was all ready to hear the argument.\u2019\n\nMr Broccoli caused quite a stir on Wednesday\u2019s show (Picture: ITV)\n\nShe added: \u2018I\u2019m not sure how many people he persuaded to go vegan.\n\n\u2018A number of people arguing he was actually calling for cannibalism, because if we\u2019re all supposed to eat more broccoli, he\u2019d eat himself wouldn\u2019t he?\n\n\u2018He took those serious arguments and slightly took them to the absurd.\u2019\n\nSusanna even later claimed Mr Broccoli was actually scared of her following the interview.\n\nSusanna Reid and Ben Shephard reflected on the interview (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018I was very disappointed in Mr Broccoli,\u2019 Susanna added. \u2018And when we came off air, the director said he was scared of me.\u2019\n\nLater in the show, Susanna explained her frustrations further, saying: \u2018I was cross with him because I thought he missed an open goal when it came to try and persuade people.\n\n\u2018Some people say if you become vegan, or if you cut down to perhaps one meat free day a week, it would have a massive impact on climate change. I think if you had the platform to be able to argue that case and if you just say, \u201cI\u2019m just a broccoli\u201d and pretend to take a call on a banana, you\u2019ve rather lost your audience.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the interview with Mr Broccoli, Piers was similarly irked, telling him: \u2018The trouble is Mr Broccoli, had you made a very coherent, powerful, science-based argument, you would have had a real impact.\n\n\u2018You would have a lot of attention through the way you dressed up for your cause, but to come on here and just be an idiot makes us think you\u2019re just an idiot.\u2019\n\nYou can catch Good Morning Britain weekdays on ITV at 6am.\n\nMORE: Susanna Reid calls out Coleen Rooney for shaming Rebekah Vardy on Instagram: \u2018I would have called first\u2019\n\nMORE: Susanna Reid lashes out at guest for \u2018interrupting\u2019 in tense gun control live TV debate", "description": "Susanna Reid has explained why she was so disappointed by Mr Broccoli on Good Morning Britain.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/susanna-reid-on-broccoli_1571291466.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
