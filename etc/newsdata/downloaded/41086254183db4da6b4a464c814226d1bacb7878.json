The issue is even more prickly when it involves world leaders like President Donald Trump, who has used bullying or violent language in social media posts.\n\nWojcicki's remarks came a day after Facebook's global affairs chief Nick Clegg told the same conference in Washington that political leaders would be allowed to break the social network's content rules. Earlier this year, Twitter announced it would label and demote, but not remove, content from politicians that violates its standards.\n\nYouTube also allows certain content to violate its rules if it is educational, documentary, scientific or artistic in nature, the CEO said.\n\nThis article tagged under: YouTube", "description": "Wojcicki said the news media is likely to cover controversial content regardless of whether it's taken down, giving context to understand it.", "authors": ["Steven Overly"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c3/9c/dfe9253a41ef898ef70350ef90d6/190925-susan-wojcicki-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
