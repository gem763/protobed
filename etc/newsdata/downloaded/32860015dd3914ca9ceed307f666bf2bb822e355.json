Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nNobody can waste big money doing nothing like Uncle Sam.\n\nWhen the government shuts down, even partially, because the White House and Congress don\u2019t do their jobs, its work doesn\u2019t get done. But the costs for doing nothing are enormous.\n\nA bipartisan Senate report estimates that three partial government shutdowns in the past five years cost taxpayers $3.7 billion in back pay, $338 million in other costs, and almost 15 million days or 57,000 years in lost productivity.\n\nThis does not include the overall hit to the economy. The five-week shutdown that ended in January stole $3 billion from the economy that will not be recovered, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.\n\n\u201cFederal government shutdowns don\u2019t save money, they actually cost taxpayers billions of dollars,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). \u201cIt\u2019s time to end government shutdowns for good.\u201d\n\nPortman is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs permanent subcommittee on investigations. He released the report Tuesday along with Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the panel.\n\nTheir estimates are low.\n\nMajor agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency; the Departments of Agriculture, Justice and Commerce; and the Defense Department, the largest federal agency, could not or did not provide complete shutdown data, including on back pay.\n\n\u201cThis raises serious questions about those agencies\u2019 ability to perform effective oversight of its own employees,\u201d a subcommittee statement said.\n\n\u201cGovernment shutdowns are avoidable failures of governance that hemorrhage taxpayer dollars, put our nation\u2019s federal agencies in organizational and financial disarray and pose risks to our national security. The impacts can be felt in every corner of our country, in red states and blue states alike,\u201d Carper said in the statement. \u201c. . . I hope this report serves as a reminder to the President and Congress about the real consequences and costs to taxpayers when we do not do our jobs.\u201d\n\nNo one needs that reminder more than President Trump.\n\nHis 35-day shutdown, from December 2018 through most of January 2019, began 11 days after his televised statement that \u201cI am proud to shut down the government for border security.\u201d\n\nThe other closures included in the report lasted 16 days in October 2013 and three days in January 2018, for a total of 54 days that many federal employees were prohibited from serving the public.\n\nNo one is hurt more by government shutdowns than government employees. In addition to losing the services that affect all Americans, they also face the uncertainty and tension that come without wages until back pay is approved.\n\n\u201cThe financial cost was enormous, but the human cost was even higher,\u201d said J. David Cox Sr., president of the American Federation of Government Employees. \u201cThe stress on families, kids, marriages, the homes and cars lost, the medical care foregone \u2014 shutdowns are nothing but pain and loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people need to know how much they are getting cheated when politicians can\u2019t find a way to reach compromise and keep the federal government running,\u201d added Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. \u201cFederal workers just want to come to work and do their jobs. Shutdowns keep them from doing that. Federal workers hate government shutdowns.\u201d\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment on these government failures.\n\nShutdowns occur when the president and Congress cannot agree on funding for agencies. Government budgets should be enacted by Oct. 1 each year, but that hasn\u2019t happened in more than 20 years. Instead, the government has been funded through temporary measures, called continuing resolutions, that have lasted from one day to a full fiscal year, according to the report.\n\nBut Congress too often can\u2019t even agree on temporary funding in time to keep agencies open. With no funding, agencies are required to close many operations. When that happens, people and services hurt.\n\nThe subcommittee compiled a list of what happens to services during shutdowns, including:\n\n\u25cfCanceling immigration hearings by the Justice Department.\n\n\u25cfSuspending recalls of dangerous products by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\n\u25cfClosing Internal Revenue Service walk-in assistance centers.\n\n\u25cfStopping Food and Drug Administration work on food safety, medical equipment and vaccines.\n\n\u25cfHalting Small Business Administration assistance to small companies.\n\n\u25cfCeasing National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations.\n\n\u25cfBlocking U.S. Geological Survey work against invasive species endangering the Great Lakes.\n\n\u25cfShutting Department of Veterans Affairs hotlines, vocational rehabilitation and educational services.\n\nTo avoid shutdowns, Portman and Carper said, Congress should maintain a regular, annual budget process to allow federal agencies to effectively plan and to avoid \u201cany possibility of a lapse in funding,\u201d and establish automatic short-term funding measures for agencies whose budgets are not approved.\n\nThe government\u2019s next fiscal year begins Oct. 1, which means another shutdown threat looms.\n\n\u201cNow, Congress has three few weeks to work together to fund the government to avoid another shutdown,\u201d Carper said. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans must come together, stop governing through continuing resolutions that are woefully inefficient, and do our most basic job by ensuring that our government has the funds it needs to operate.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump voters now blame him for the government shutdown\n\nReport shows sharp drop in federal employee morale under Trump", "description": "A\u00a0Senate report estimates that three partial shutdowns in the past five years cost $3.7 billion in back pay.
