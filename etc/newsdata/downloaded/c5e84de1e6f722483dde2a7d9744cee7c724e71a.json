We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

This observation doesn\u2019t qualify as revelation for anybody. However, they\u2019re so bad that usually exploitable pitchers like Junis become tidy mid-tier plays. We can anticipate roughly a strikeout per inning over six frames with an elevated chance for a win bonus. He should receive plenty of run support opposite Edwin Jackson.\n\nGavin Lux \u2013 2B \u2013 Los Angeles Dodgers (vs Antonio Senzatela)\n\nAfter hitting eighth in his major league debut on Monday, the Dodgers threw Lux straight into the fire last night by batting him leadoff. The ultimate result was a bland 1-for-4 performance. Regardless of where he hits in the lineup, Lux is clearly a high value bargain capable of blowing away his tiny price tag. In this case, the difference between hitting first and eighth in the order will affect his popularity more than it affects expected outcomes. A matchup against Senzatela and a bad Rockies bullpen should help matters.\n\nMauricio Dubon \u2013 2B/SS \u2013 San Francisco Giants (at Michael Wacha)\n\nDubon has consistently hit eighth in the lineup since joining the Giants, but his skill set belongs in the top of the lineup (specifically, this lineup). He puts plenty of hard-hit balls in play. He lacks for premium attributes like jaw dropping power, stingy plate discipline, or indefatigable contact rates, but the total package adds up to an average or slightly better play. Wacha tends to make short, volatile starts. There\u2019s always a chance for a meltdown.\n\nJosh Rojas \u2013 OF \u2013 Arizona Diamondbacks (vs Chris Paddack)\n\nAfter a tepid start to his major league career, Rojas is on a bit of a hot streak. He\u2019s back to hitting second for the DBacks although he\u2019s still a good value if he bats sixth tonight. He\u2019s a line drive and hard contact machine who skews towards fly ball contact. His bat is long through the zone which should help to fend off changeups from Paddack. It\u2019s obviously not the juiciest matchup, and yet Rojas is probably the best value-play in the entire slate \u2013 at least until we see which unexpected players are starting.\n\nAlso Consider: Trevor Williams, Michael Wacha, Lewis Brinson, Willi Castro, Sheldon Neuse, Austin Dean, Chad Pinder\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nYasiel Puig \u2013OF \u2013 Cleveland Indians (vs Ivan Nova)\n\nNova is on a heater. A closer examination of his performance reveals it to be a fragile hot streak. He\u2019s still a highly exploitable pitcher to a quality opponent. Puig will likely bat cleanup despite an ongoing slump. His ownership rate will likely be low in deference to his recent struggles and Nova\u2019s success. As such, Puig makes for an interesting contrarian play due to elevated home run potential and a valuable role. Teammate Franmil Reyes is a better bet for a home run. However, Puig projects to outperform him by a slim margin.\n\nAlso Consider: Chris Paddack, Paul Goldschmidt, Matt Chapman, Corey Seager\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nJorge Soler \u2013 OF \u2013 Kansas City Royals (vs Edwin Jackson)\n\nWith Khris Davis virtually irrelevant in DFS this season, Soler has filled his role as all-or-nothing multi-homer threat*. He\u2019s on the cusp of reaching the 40-homer plateau. Jackson is an inaccurate pitcher who can hardly induce a whiff or limit hard contact. He\u2019s coughed up 2.94 HR/9. Waiting behind Jackson is an equally terrible Tigers bullpen. This is a mouthwatering situation for Soler. He projects for one-third of a home run which honestly sounds pessimistic to me.\n\n*Despite outlandish power, Soler has only one multi-homer game this season. Don\u2019t let that dissuade you from hoping.\n\nAlso Consider: Shane Bieber, Hyun-Jin Ryu, Jorge Soler, Cody Bellinger, Mike Trout", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Wednesday, September 4.
