That surgery takes about that long.\n\n\u2018If we\u2019d made the final, he would still be here with us. In fairness to Saracens, they\u2019d agreed that.\n\n\u2018But if we weren\u2019t they wanted to get him back for surgery as quickly as possible.\u2019\n\nAs Sportsmail revealed last week, Williams took the ankle blow in training before the South Africa match.\n\nThe full-back was forced to watch on from the sidelines, whilst on crutches, in Yokohama\n\nWales missed him as they lost the game 19-16 in Yokohama last Sunday.\n\nWhile Williams\u2019 recovery may go better than expected, a three-month lay-off will mean he will miss the opening rounds of Saracens\u2019 Champions Cup defence, and the festive period of the Premiership.\n\nAnd he could be a doubt for the first round of the 2020 Six Nations. Wales kick off the tournament against Italy in Cardiff on February 1, 13 weeks away.", "description": "WILL KELLEHER IN TOKYO: The Wales and Saracens star would have stayed in Japan if Wales had made the final, but flew back on Monday and has since undergone surgery on the injury.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/20372544-0-image-a-14_1572436391869.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
