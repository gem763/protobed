And I did \u2013 all kinds of cheeses: a beautiful hard cheese called Napier, a racy little blue called London Blue, a soft cheese in the spirit of the subtle, creamy cheeses of Grenoble, called Londonshire. It was one of the most fascinating days I have spent all year, partly due to the mix of the student body. There was a Polish hotelier, hoping to set up his own cheese courses after his early career as a bakery tutor led to epic weight gain. A Danish driving instructor, who had lived in the UK for 45 years, was the most pro-cheese and anti-Brexit person I have ever met, which led me to suspect some connection between those two things. A guy from Kansas was tacking the course on to the end of a trip to London for the DSEI arms fair; we passed an agreeable (to me) five minutes arguing about the protests outside it. (\u201cDo these guys even know what they\u2019re protesting against,\u201d he mused. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s different every year, as you would know if you knew who the arms were killing.\u201d)\n\nBut apart from all the humans, the revelation was whey: I had filed this away in my mind as a tasteless substance favoured by health freaks whose protein needs were so high that there weren\u2019t enough hours in the day to service them with real food. The very existence of a thing called \u201cvegan whey\u201d made me suspect it was more of a wellness thing than a real, food-related thing (in fact, vegan whey is just a name for plant-based protein \u2013 it has nothing to do with whey).\n\nOver the course of the day, we produced more whey than I have ever seen in the rest of my life put together, and it was clearly not a waste product, but carefully collected. I came to realise that maybe I had been missing something.\n\nThe obvious use for it is to make ricotta, which is usually just boiled whey. Indeed, if you have industrial quantities of whey, it would be perverse not to make ricotta. With the three litres of whey that I took home after my cheese day, though, there would be no point; you would just be making washing up. Instead, use it as a kind of enriched or, if you prefer, \u201cmagic\u201d water.\n\nI started off with perfectly plain fresh pasta, cooked for four minutes in whey cut 50: 50 with water. The result was unspeakably good: it had a bizarre depth and richness and felt utterly complete. I had fried some sage leaves for flavour, but ended up eating them separately as pudding. You can use the same technique to boil vegetables, although the less sweet your veg, the more you can taste the difference. Cooking in this fashion has quite a subtle effect on carrots and sweetcorn, but on green beans, the impact is nuclear. Even the colour seems more intense.\n\nYou can also use whey in preserving, for sauerkrauts and whatnot, which puts you in the incredibly nutritious and also very fashionable territory of fermentation (see Tim Spector\u2019s book The Diet Myth for the fullest account). This is incredibly good for your gut microbiome, which in turn is good for your entire health, including mental wellbeing (the vagus nerve, which transmits messages from the brain to the gut, goes both ways). So you can mess up your digestion with a low mood, but also lift your mood with excellent digestion. Fermentation was a part of most cuisines centuries before its benefits were discovered, except in places such as Britain, where we preserve with vinegar, which kills everything. It will be another eight weeks before I can tell you what the sauerkraut tastes like, and that assumes that it doesn\u2019t rot like the last time I tried it and end up smelling like a dead body. But I didn\u2019t have any whey that time.\n\nYou can add whey to the soaking water for beans, and to soups, like a mega-stock. It has a rejuvenating effect on soil, but you have to dilute it, otherwise it \u201cburns\u201d plant roots. You can use it on your hair instead of shampoo, but you have to not mind the smell. And bafflingly, says Keith Sides, one half of Wildes Cheese, it has the same restorative affect on concrete as it does on muscles.\n\nReally, the only thing whey doesn\u2019t do is get distributed in supermarkets; you could cut a deal with a local cheesemaker, but if you really wanted a year-round supply of whey, it would be simpler to make your own cheese. You will need pasteurised milk, a starter culture (\u201cmesophilic\u201d just means it grows at a moderate temperature, so heat your milk to 32C) and rennet, plus a lot of patience. But you will also end up with a ton of cheese, and cheese is great.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
