Additionally, a Warren administration would have to raise money to pay the estimated $30 trillion price tag for Medicare For All over 10 years and the $3 trillion she\u2019s proposed as part of her plan to combat climate change.\n\nAnd critics of her plan say her estimates are overly rosy because wealthy people would find ways to avoid paying some of the tax\u2026\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Elizabeth Warren, you now have enough equity in the bank with voters so she can afford to be less forthcoming with some of those details,\u201d Payne said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Finance.Yahoo.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
