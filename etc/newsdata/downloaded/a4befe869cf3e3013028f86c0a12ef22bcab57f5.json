I\u2019m just not who I am before. I\u2019m something different.\n\n\u2018So my new name is Love, aka Brother Love.\u2019\n\nDiddy is no stranger to a name change (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nHe later added that he would only answer to \u2018Love\u2019 or \u2018Brother Love\u2019, and not to any of his previous monikers.\n\nTwo days later however, he admitted that he was \u2018joking\u2019 regarding the name change \u2013 but in February 2018, he backtracked, and said he was going to be known simply as \u2018Love\u2019.\n\n\u2018I never went back to Diddy and I made an edit from Brother Love, since I\u2019m already black, to just Love,\u2019 he said on Jimmy Kimmel Live.\n\n\u2018The Brother seemed redundant. And it\u2019s working out great. Who doesn\u2019t love Love?\u2019\n\nDiddy asides, he has also previously been known under the stage names Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Puffy \u2013 and of course his real name, Sean Combs.\n\nThat\u2019s a whole lot of names.\n\nA rep for Diddy confirmed to Metro.co.uk that the name change is indeed true.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
