Written in felt-tip pen and attached with a bit of Sellotape to the door of the shop, it read: \u2018We will be closing early at 5pm today as Dad passed away yesterday.\u2019\n\nAnd then came the sucker punch: \u2018Sorry for any inconvenience.\u2019\n\nThe shop is called Lena Stores and it is located at the end of my North London street.\n\nThe writer of the note, the son and co-owner of this family-run shop, whom I\u2019ve only ever known as Mr Patel, was standing behind the counter looking a bit shell-shocked.\n\nThe writer of the note, the son and co-owner of this family-run shop, whom I\u2019ve only ever known as Mr Patel (pictured), was standing behind the counter looking a bit shell-shocked\n\nI passed on my condolences and then asked why on earth he was still open. \u2018But it\u2019s my customers,\u2019 he said. \u2018We never close.\u2019\n\nThis is true. Lena Stores is open 365 days a year, from seven in the morning until eight at night, come rain, shine, snow drifts or a police cordon shutting off the street after a convict had escaped from a prison van and was hiding out in someone\u2019s garden shed.\n\nMost readers, no doubt, will know of somewhere similar in their locale, an open-all-hours store, usually family run, that has become a focal point of a community and a beacon of reliability in a fast-paced and ever-changing world.\n\nLena Stores has rescued me on Christmas Day when I ran out of butter and the turkey was drying out, and on Easter Sunday when it turned out someone (OK, their father) had eaten the youngest child\u2019s chocolate egg.\n\nWritten in felt-tip pen and attached with a bit of Sellotape to the door of the shop, it read: \u2018We will be closing early at 5pm today as Dad passed away yesterday'\n\nIn the 11 years we have lived here, Lena Stores has become part of our life, a place that stocks not just newspapers and a pint of milk, but every conceivable light bulb and battery, three types of pickled onions, spices, pesto, cherry jam, nappies, baking powder, cheap toys for the kids to spend their pocket money on . . . and so much more.\n\nAnd holding fort, behind the counter, has always been Ashok Patel, who died earlier this month just a few days short of his 70th birthday, having run Lena Stores with his oldest son Raj, 47, for the past 21 years. Nearly 6ft tall and broad-shouldered, this gentle bear of a man would sit perched on a heater behind the counter wearing two jumpers in winter, or stand basking in the sunshine and chatting to customers in summer.\n\nHe was known as \u2018The Big Man\u2019 by some, \u2018Pops\u2019 by others. To me, he was Old Mr Patel to distinguish him from his son, Young Mr Patel.\n\nThe Patel family, like thousands of other Patels in Britain \u2014 not least our current Home Secretary \u2014 came originally from Gujarat in India, a region famed for its entrepreneurs and adventurers, many of whom settled in Uganda, Africa, where Ashok was born.\n\nAnd holding fort, behind the counter, has always been Ashok Patel (pictured), who died earlier this month just a few days short of his 70th birthday\n\nThere, his family had a good business with an interest in a chemical factory, a cinema and a shop. \u2018We were always told they had a Rolls-Royce. They were very successful and had a good life,\u2019 says Raj.\n\nBut then Idi Amin, Uganda\u2019s despotic president, started his purge of Asian Ugandans, booting them out of the country.\n\nAs many as 27,000 found shelter in Britain in the early 1970s, many becoming shopkeepers.\n\nAshok and his family, however, went back to India, where he became a rice and tobacco farmer. But he found life hard.\n\n\u2018My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over; he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it\u2019d be a better life,\u2019 Raj says.\n\n\u2018My uncle was already in Britain and he told us to come over; he sponsored us to come to the UK. He said it\u2019d be a better life,\u2019 Raj (pictured) says\n\nIn 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben, and his three sons came to England. Raj recalls the moment he arrived as a teenager, speaking no English. \u2018London was very beautiful and very clean. It was so different from our village in India, where we only had electricity for a couple of hours a day.\u2019\n\nFrom the day he arrived in Thatcher\u2019s Britain, Ashok worked as a grocer, initially with his brother in a corner shop in Tottenham, North London, before saving enough to open his own: Lena Stores in Islington, which he took over in 1998.\n\nYes, the customers came to Lena Stores for groceries, but mostly for Old Mr Patel, who would dispense free lollipops to children and gossip to their parents and grandparents.\n\nThe shop itself is tiny, about a quarter the size of a typical Tesco Express. The freezer cabinet filled with Magnum ice creams, bags of peas and (very good value) \u00a31 garlic bread baguettes, has a handle held together with gaffer tape.\n\nThe lino floor is scuffed. The superglue is stacked next to the Patak\u2019s vindaloo sauce, and the balls of garden twine are shoved into a cardboard box along with large nail brushes, a shower mat and some 13-amp, three-way mains adapters.\n\nBut amid this chaos lies a staggering array of food, drink and household essentials. It is a microcosm of all that is best \u2014 and surviving still \u2014 in Britain\u2019s high streets.\n\nNot the Britain of self-service tills and chains selling vapid coffee.\n\nNo, the Britain of quirky independent shops, run by dedicated, hard-working families who choose to open their doors and serve their customers \u2014 even when they are grieving.\n\nNapoleon may have meant it as an insult, but Britain still is a nation of shopkeepers \u2014 just. Nearly one in ten people in Britain works for a shop and the retail sector makes up five per cent of the British economy.\n\nIn 1987, Ashok, his wife, Lalitaben (pictured together), and his three sons came to England\n\nOf course, most of our groceries are bought from one of the big four supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons. But there are thriving corner shops, despite all predictions they would be killed off by internet shopping and the march of the supermarkets.\n\nOf the 46,388 convenience stores in Britain, about 33,000, or nearly three-quarters, are independent, according to the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS). That number has fallen in the past few years, but not dramatically so.\n\n\u2018About 15 years ago, all the prophecies were that there would be no more independents left. That\u2019s definitely not happened,\u2019 says James Lowman, ACS chief executive.\n\nTrue, more and more convenience shops are now owned by a big supermarket chain. \u2018But it\u2019s a very slow move,\u2019 Lowman adds. \u2018The best shops in Britain are still run by independent shopkeepers, who are close to their customers.\u2019\n\nAnd few were closer to their customers than Ashok Patel. After he died \u2014 he was fully diagnosed with cancer only last month \u2014 a tribute was posted on a local online message board and it triggered an outpouring of grief that was immediate and heartfelt, giving lie to the idea that there is no sense of community in inner-city London.\n\nThe residents felt they had lost not just a local shopkeeper but a pillar of the community.\n\nOne, Emily Grazebrook, said: \u2018When I first moved to the area ten years ago, my husband and I had very little money, as we had put it all down as a deposit for a flat.\n\n\u2018I went into Lena and asked if they would take a cheque for some groceries. Ashok and Raj welcomed me to the neighbourhood and told me to put my cheque book away \u2014 I could pay them when money came in the following week. I was so moved by their kindness.\u2019\n\nWhen I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. \u2018We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,\u2019 Raj tells me\n\nThat struck a chord with me. If I ever nipped out to get some vital missing ingredient and then found I\u2019d forgotten my wallet, Old Mr Patel always told me I could pay him later. He never kept a tally of all the credit; he trusted that you\u2019d remember \u2014 which I would sometimes do, with a pang of embarrassment, only days later.\n\nWhen we moved into the street, my eldest child was just six, my youngest not born.\n\nBut all four of my children have taken their first crucial steps to independence by being sent to the end of the road to buy cereal or a loaf of bread, knowing Mr Patel would help them find the item and count out the correct change. They were always safe there.\n\nWhen I told my children that he had died, they were genuinely upset. \u2018We know 99 per cent of the children who come in here,\u2019 Raj tells me. \u2018And we have seen so many grow up. When they first arrive, we can\u2019t see them from this side of the counter.\u2019\n\nToddlers barely able to peer above the rack of Kit Kats and Lion bars, but soon old enough to buy stationery or their first can of beer before going off to university.\n\n\u2018Many of the naughty teenagers who have caused trouble grow up and come in later to apologise to us,\u2019 he adds. But there was one incident when the youths were more than just naughty: they were dangerously violent.\n\nOne December morning in 2012, three men, aged 25, 22 and 18, entered the shop, drunk, wielding knives and intent on stealing alcohol and anything else they could get their hands on. Ashok Patel was manning the shop on his own that day and he kept a baseball bat under the counter. \u2018When the boys came, he fought back,\u2019 recalls Raj. \u2018I always said if he was ever threatened, he should just hand over the cash. It\u2019s not worth it. But he always got so angry. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve been working long hours, seven days a week, I\u2019m not going to give away my money.\u201d\u2019 And he didn\u2019t.\n\nThen 63, he fought the three thugs, whom the judge later declared, when they were sentenced, \u2018deliberately set out to commit a robbery on a vulnerable person\u2019. At first, Ashok was successful, pushing them out the door. Then he slipped and the three youths returned, with one stabbing him in the head, another using the baseball bat to attack him.\n\n\u2018The blade was this close to his brain,\u2019 his son says, holding his thumb and finger half an inch apart. He was left in a pool of his own blood, while the three stepped over him to steal beer, milk tokens and \u00a3220 in cash.\n\nRemarkably, Old Mr Patel was back behind the counter within a month, with his arm in a sling and his head bandaged like Mr Bump. He\u2019d gladly show his scar to any customer.\n\n\u2018He was a very strong man,\u2019 says his son. He certainly was.\n\n\u2018He just loved working in a shop,\u2019 adds Raj sadly. \u2018He loved meeting people and being part of the community.\u2019\n\nThe number of Gujarati shopkeepers in Britain is falling markedly \u2014 mostly because their children and grandchildren have little desire for the long hours and meagre rewards. Raj\u2019s children, Keya, 24, and Jaimini, 22, both went to Brunel University. One is now a businesswoman, the younger training to be an accountant.\n\n\u2018My father was very proud of them,\u2019 says Raj. \u2018I\u2019ve asked if they want to take on the shop, but they don\u2019t want to.\u2019\n\nIt is easy to romanticise this first generation of immigrant shopkeepers, who worked all hours to make a better life for their families. But they are as much a part of Britain\u2019s story as the coal miners, wheelwrights and lamp-lighters of previous generations.\n\nThe majority of us no longer attend a parish church or a local butcher at whose counter we can gossip, but most still have a corner shop. If you\u2019re lucky, it will be run by someone like Mr Patel.\n\nOnly when they are gone will we understand how these shops and shopkeepers have helped weave the fabric of this country together. Run by families who kept the shutters up and the lights on, rather than cause an inconvenience.", "description": "HARRY WALLOP: The writer of the note, the son and co-owner of this family-run shop, whom I've only ever known as Mr Patel, was standing behind the counter looking a bit shell-shocked.", "authors": ["Harry Wallop For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/22/19760052-0-image-a-61_1571173674944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
