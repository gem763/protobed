The appointment has been viewed as an admission the government is not on track to meet its Paris climate change targets, despite its claims to the contrary.\n\nClimate and Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the appointment was a due-diligence process to ensure the $2.5 billion allocated for direct action purchased sufficient carbon abatement.\n\n\"The Department and the expert panel are working together to ensure this investment delivers the highest possible quantity of abatement,'' he said.\n\nAlbanese's reset\n\nIn the first of three headland speeches designed to recalibrate Labor after its election loss, leader Anthony Albanese switched the sales pitch for Labor's climate policy towards one of job creation.\n\nLeader of the Opposition Anthony Albanese at a CEDA discussion in Perth yesterday. AAP\n\nHe recommitted Labor to Bill Shorten's target of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 but said this presented the opportunity for a manufacturing boom, be it through hydrogen technology or value-adding lithium deposits in Australia by building batteries here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a gesture to the coal workers who abandoned Labor at the election, especially in Queensland, he said the metallurgical coal industry would benefit from a low-carbon future because it was needed to produce steel for wind turbines.\n\nAs he spoke, four of his MPs \u2013 Meryl Swanson, Mike Freelander, Milton Dick and Kimberly Kitching \u2013 as well as Heidi D\u2019Elboux, the deputy director of the Federal Labor Business Forum, and Georgia Tree, a policy adviser to shadow trade minister Madeleine King, embarked on a three-day tour of mines and refineries as well as the Adani Renewables Rugby Run Solar Farm in Moranbah.\n\nMore MPs were scheduled to go but shadow ministers were diverted to Perth for a meeting and Mr Albanese's speech. Frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon, who was given a scare in his coal seat of Hunter at the election and has been most vocal ever since, helped organise the trip.\n\n\"It's really important that we get Labor MPs, especially inner-city MPs, out into the regions building their appreciation of the role the mining industry plays in the economy,'' he said.\n\n\"We can't do it too often.''\n\nMinerals Council of Australia chief executive officer Tania Constable said the trip \"reinforces the strong and positive relationship between the mining industry and the Labor Party\".\n\nMs Constable also welcomed Mr Albanese's recognition of an ongoing role for coal.\n\n\"Mining will ... provide the foundations for the innovations of tomorrow. The materials needed for renewable energy \u2013 such as solar and wind turbines \u2013 electric vehicles and even commercial space travel will come from mining.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlue-collar credentials\n\nLabor senator Kim Carr, who is no fan of Mr Albanese, welcomed the focus on blue-collar workers and the message that technology will drive jobs.\n\nAnother Labor frontbencher, who asked not to be identified, said it was obvious that Labor should reconnect with blue-collar workers and said criticism by the Greens would help with that.\n\nIt made sense to point out a shift to renewables would not sideline coal.\n\n\"We've got a 50 per cent renewable target. Where did people think the other 50 per cent was coming from?\"'\n\nActing Greens leader Adam Bandt said Labor was joining the Liberals by supporting thermal coal, \"setting Australia on a unity ticket towards climate catastrophe\".\n\n\"Without a plan to phase out coal, you don\u2019t have a plan to address the climate crisis,'' Mr Bandt said.\n\nMr Taylor said Labor must drop its Paris target to reduce emissions by 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n\"The idea that he's supporting blue-collar jobs and manufacturing across Australia is a fairy-tale as long as he hangs on to those targets,'' he said.", "description": "A delegation of Labor MPs has embarked on a tour of Queensland coal mines as the party seeks to reconnect with blue-collar voters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3272%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_39%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c80954ee1b2f414403b768371566c0e47bddcfe0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
