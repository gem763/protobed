And we know that customers still want physical products \u2026 and ultimately we are going to offer that. \u201c\n\nThe Canadian businessman, who is chief executive of Sunrise Records, snapped up 100 stores from administrators earlier this year, rescuing almost 1,500 jobs.\n\nSome 27 branches were closed by administrators, including HMV\u2019s original first store on London\u2019s Oxford Street, but HMV has since reopened a number of outlets and currently has 114 in total.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Doing something different\u2019 \u2013\n\nHMV is now seeking to listen more closely to its customers and respond rapidly to changing musical tastes, in order to differentiate itself from the likes of US tech titan Amazon.\n\n\u201cEverybody is going to have to change not only how they think, how they work, how they sell,\u201d Putman told AFP, when questioned about the struggling British high street.\n\n\u201cBecause if all you are doing is offering what Amazon offers, then it is going to be really hard to compete. So you definitely need to do something a lot different.\u201d\n\nMost recently, that has meant that the group has embraced nostalgic demand for old-style vinyl records, as many customers choose to shun top-end technology.\n\nAnd it has also sought to tap into strong demand for Korean K-Pop music that appeals far more to the younger generation.\n\n\u201cWe recently just did a survey in the stores to see who is the demographic coming, and it was really split in all ages,\u201d Putman told AFP.\n\n\u201cSo what we are seeing is they are buying different things.\n\n\u201cBut that younger demographic is certainly coming in to buy K-Pop from us. They are certainly coming in to buy vinyl from us, record players.\n\n\u201cAnd \u2026 when you look at the technology offering we have, you know, they are buying our headphones.\n\n\u201cSo we are getting them in and they\u2019re buying; they just may not be buying exactly what they were ten years ago.\u201d\n\nPutman was speaking to media ahead of Friday\u2019s opening of HMV\u2019s biggest store in Britain\u2019s second biggest city of Birmingham.\n\nIn recent months and years, Britain\u2019s traditional high street shops have been buckling under pressure from souring consumer sentiment ahead of Brexit.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Remaining authentic\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnd the high street is also battling rising costs and rents, high taxes on business property, fierce online competition and stretched household budgets.\n\nMost recently, debt-plagued British travel agent Thomas Cook \u2014 a staple of many of the nation\u2019s city centres \u2014 declared bankruptcy.\n\nPutman insisted however that HMV, which filed separately for bankruptcy in both 2013 and 2018, would still be around as long as it remained relevant.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt we are going to be here in two, three, four, five years,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cAs long as we keep listening to the customer, we remain relevant, we remain authentic, I think we will be here.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 The new boss of long-troubled British music retailer HMV told AFP it can overcome \u201ctough times\u201d on the high street", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/9aa042_bust-in-years-ailing-chain-was-rescued-in-an-undisclosed-sum-by-canadian-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
