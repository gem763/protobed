Known as Uriko, they are key to organisers\u2019 plans to meet the demand for beer, a significant logistical issue since bars were drunk dry before kick-off when Australia visited in 2017. The Japanese brewery of Heineken, the tournament\u2019s official beer sponsor, increased production by 80% \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019ll try not to run out of stock no matter what,\u201d they say \u2013 while briefing sessions were held in host cities, where restaurant and hotel operators were warned against debilitating booze shortages. \u201cWe hope they will take care to ensure enough beer is in supply during the event,\u201d said an official from Oita prefecture.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bottles of Heineken, featuring labels with the Web Ellis Cup logo, on the production line in Yokohama.

The CEO of the organising committee, Akira Shimazu, says they are \u201cincredibly symbolic for Japanese people \u2026 The noble warrior, fighting with every inch of their body, mind and spirit is a fitting comparison to the modern, elite rugby player.\u201d\n\nJonny Wilkinson: \u2018It took a few years for the pressure to really build. And then it exploded\u2019 | Andy Bull Read more\n\n3 Eye-catching kits include Australia\u2019s \u201cindigenous-inspired\u201d away shirt, which they will wear in their pool match against Uruguay and perhaps again in the semi-finals if they get the chance, and features a \u201cdurable iconic collar\u201d, and Argentina\u2019s Nike-produced change shirt, with its central stripe that starts off gold, turns blue, ends up white and is decorated with a hot pink swoosh. New Zealand set out to \u201cbring together Japanese and Maori cultures\u201d and did so by getting a Japanese designer, Yohji Yamamoto, to come up with \u201chand-drawn koru and fern motifs\u201d. The result is approximately as pleasing as a garment that is basically black could be. In further cross-cultural news, the Kiwis\u2019 training top features a fuko neko (a lucky cat, though it seems mainly to be angry).\n\n4 The only stadium that has been specially constructed for the World Cup is the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium, which will host two group games. It was specially constructed with not enough seating, which meant that temporary extra stands had to be specially constructed too \u2013 bumping up the capacity to 16,000, not far off 50% of Kamaishi\u2019s 35,000 population. The eponymous recovery was from the earthquake and tsunami of 2011, which destroyed the schools that used to occupy the site.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium is the only specially constructed venue for Japan 2019, will host two group games and features temporary stands.

The system is due to be used for every accredited person \u2013 athletes, media, staff and officials \u2013 at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.\n\n6 The two mascots are shishi \u2013 \u201cmythical creatures that are said to bring happiness and ward off evil\u201d, which look like very pale outsized Ewoks. Ren-G, apparently, were \u201cborn when this ancient spirit met the five values of rugby \u2013 integrity, passion, solidarity, discipline\u201d. Eagle-eyed readers will notice one particularly special thing about the five values of rugby is that there are only four of them (the missing one is apparently respect). Anyone who meets one of these creatures should bear in mind that \u201cwhen they are happy they will swing their hair in a circle and break out into the Ren-G dance\u201d, so would be well advised to keep their distance, or failing that to take active measures to ensure that the shishi remain unhappy.\n\n7 Toshio Yasuda, 88, is the oldest of the 13,000 World Cup volunteers, parsed from 38,000 applicants, officially dubbed Team No Side. \u201cI get a lot of energy from the young people,\u201d he says. All applicants were interviewed, after participating in a group problem-solving exercise that involved passing a ball around using plastic piping. \u201cIt was a lot of fun,\u201d said one participant. \u201cThere were people who I thought looked quite uptight at first, but then they came up with a lot of ideas.\u201d The volunteers\u2019 uniforms are blue with yellow lines that symbolise \u201cunity, smiles and memories\u201d.\n\n8 This year\u2019s World Cup ball is called the Sirius. It is almost exactly the same as the ball for the 2015 World Cup, except that Gilbert, the manufacturer, has \u201cbeen able to get much more definition on the pimple\u201d. The clever thing about this year\u2019s pimple, the company explains, is that it has made the ball less slippery without making it less aerodynamic. The ball shares its name with the seventh-closest star to Earth, with which it apparently \u201cshares important characteristics\u201d, at least with a little gentle crowbarring. For example: \u201cSirius [the star] is actually two stars and Sirius [the ball] comprises two star-shaped pimples of different heights that aid grip and water dispersion.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\n9 Organisers have had to plan for the possibility that games will be affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters, particularly with the tournament starting before the end of typhoon season. Alan Gilpin, the tournament director, has admitted that \u201cwe\u2019re likely to have some issues\u201d and reassures fans that contingency plans are in place. While knockout matches can be rescheduled, pool games cannot; any not completed will be declared drawn.\n\n10 The official World Cup anthem is, once again, World in Union. This time it has been performed by Kiyoe Yoshioka, lead singer of the Japanese band Ikimono-gakari. Yoshioka previously had a minor part in the film Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened, for which she also contributed the theme song, Smile. \u201cI have really enjoyed working with the music and lyrics, giving them what I hope is a unique, Japanese interpretation,\u201d she said. \u201cWorld in Union captures the spirit of global friendship and respect that rugby epitomises. I\u2019m happy to be able to help spread this wonderful message throughout Japan and to the world.\u201d", "description": "Rugby union\u2019s showpiece event will see eye-catching kits, facial recognition for journalists and spontaneously dancing mascots", "authors": ["Simon Burnton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b38d469200eb237520fd39054692642fd66a223c/0_2_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c8a86fab112700c45dfeacf6998d99d5", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
