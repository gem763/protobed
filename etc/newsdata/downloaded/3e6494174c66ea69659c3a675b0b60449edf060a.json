Even after dispiriting results like last night\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Valencia, Chelsea fans believe. \u2018Super Frank\u2019 has always delivered domestic and European glory.\n\nLampard is in the second season of his management career after cutting his teeth in the Championship with Derby County. He is still learning his trade. The Champions League and the Premier League are harsh teachers. The supporters at the Bridge may have to undergo some difficult lessons over the next few months.\n\n\u201cI think we created enough in the game,\u201d Lampard said after the defeat to the Spanish side. \u201cNot lots of fantastic chances, but good chances.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Valencia \u2013 who are going through a period of turmoil themselves \u2013 set up for a draw but were ready to exploit any signs of weakness from their opponents. In the 74th minute Chelsea obliged. The home side lined up to deal with a Daniel Parejo free kick but switched off when Rodrigo made a run across the face of the defence. The winger was allowed to enter the box unchallenged and slot the ball into the net.\n\nPart of the Lampard narrative is that he is overseeing a young, inexperienced squad that, like their manager, are being educated on the job. There were enough seasoned veterans in the team against Valencia to guide the youngsters through this sort of Champions League group game. The reality is that they are not good enough.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Chelsea vs Valencia player ratings Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Jorginho provided little. Mateo Kovacic did not impose himself. The full backs, Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso appear to have seen better days. Willian is almost dangerous but the Brazilian has never been clinical enough and Pedro was disappointing. Tammy Abraham put in another sterling effort but the striker lacked supply and support. For all their bluster, Chelsea created little in the way of serious opportunities.\n\nPedro came on for Mason Mount, who was the victim of a brutal late tackle by Francis Coquelin early in the game. Lampard had options on the bench. Christian Pulisic, the \u00a360 million buy from Borussia Dortmund was an obvious choice. The manager decided to turn to Pedro. The American remained on the bench.\n\n\u201cHe is in the plans,\u201d Lampard said of Pulisic. \u201cWe have got the squad and the wingers to choose from. With Pedro\u2019s experience in the Champions League it was a decision to make, but Christian is well in the plans.\u201d\n\nPulisic was overlooked for the 5-2 Premier League victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers and left to watch when Chelsea needed some trickery to break down a deep-lying Valencia defence. The 21-year-old was supposed to fill the creative hole left by Eden Hazard but it is hard to imagine Pulisic fulfilling that role.\n\nThe winger was signed in the January window but it is doubtful that Lampard would have sanctioned the deal. Although he is the talisman for the United States team, Pulisic is struggling with the pace and physicality of life in England. He stood out in America and did well at Dortmund but there were always questions about whether he had the quality Chelsea require.\n\nEarlier this month Jadon Sancho explained to The Independent his rationale for leaving Manchester City to go to Dortmund. \u201cChristian Pulisic was there,\u201d the England winger said. \u201cHe was starting every week. I felt I could compete with him.\u201d\n\nSancho meant no disrespect. It was simply that he saw an established first-teamer that he believed he could displace. When Lampard was in his pomp at Stamford Bridge, the club signed top-class individuals, players who were at the top of their game and could shrug off the threat of any young upstart who wanted to take their position. When Chelsea sold Hazard and signed Pulisic they traded down. Dortmund traded up when they bought Sancho.\n\nPulisic needs time. Lampard was probably right when he plumped for Pedro. Either way, the Chelsea manager needs better players if his team are to compete at this level.\n\nRoss Barkley\u2019s late penalty miss overshadowed the side\u2019s structural flaws but the confusion before the spot kick and Willian\u2019s antics will require Lampard\u2019s attention. The 41-year-old insisted that there was a defined hierarchy in these situations but there was confusion \u2013 and rancour \u2013 on the pitch. It could not have helped Barkley\u2019s state of mind at a vital moment.\n\nLampard will take stock before the Premier League matchup with Liverpool at the Bridge on Sunday. The 3-4-3 formation deployed against Wolves and Valencia would be a dangerous system to utilise against Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side, even if N\u2019Golo Kante and Antonio Rudiger are available.\n\nChelsea suffered from mental mistakes and lack of quality against Valencia. Clever, organised opposition will make them look vulnerable. It will not be easy for Lampard to restore the glory days.", "description": "The goodwill towards Frank Lampard cascades from the stands at Stamford Bridge.
