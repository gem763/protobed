Taking the edge off-of weak growth, industrial output expanded at 5.8%, above 5% consensus whilst retail sales also beat at 7.8% YoY versus 7.5% forecast. So, whilst growth was a disappointment, the rest average it out, hence the muted market reaction from the likes of AUD and NZD.\n\nRBA\u2019s Governor Philip Lowe thinks that negative rates are \u201cextraordinarily unlikely\u201d and that low rates along are not likely to stimulate investment. \u201cIn my view, we\u2019re clearly in the world of diminishing returns to monetary easing\u2026\" which could be taken to mean RBA will favor QE of negative rates.\n\nRazor-thin ranges for the majors. USD/JPY is consolidating in a small range above the pivotal level if 108.50. EUR/USD is brimming at its highs after closing above 1.1100 yesterday. GBP/USD is treading water around 1.2850. NZD I the strongest major (as seen with its dominating strength on the FX dashboard). GBP/NZD has fallen -0.8% but, given high levels of volatility, it has pushed the ATR up, hence it \u2018only\u2019 covering 50% of its ATR.\n\nAUD/NZD is the only pair to be near its ATR and, with little news flow expected to impact the cross direction, the move could be done for the day and could be prone to mean reversion.\n\nAsian Cash Indices % Change\n\nEquity Brief:\n\nSome profit-taking activities can be seen in several Asian stock markets in today\u2019s Asian session on the backdrop of mixed economic data from China. China Q3 GDP growth has slowed to 6.0% y/y (below consensus of 6.1% y/y), its lowest growth rate since Q1 1992 while Industrial Production has managed to beat expectations with a growth rate at 5.8% y/y in Sep (5.0% y/y consensus).\n\nDespite EU and U.K has agreed to a Brexit deal and the ball now is back in the U.K for a parliamentary vote scheduled this Sat. Thus, some unwinding of \u201crisk-on \u201cpositions can be justified as we head into the weekend with the possibility that U.K PM Boris Johnson may not be able to gather enough votes in the parliament as the Northern Ireland DUP, which the government relies on for support in key votes has reiterated no support on the latest deal.\n\nThe ASX 200 has continued to decline for the 2nd consecutive day, where it has shed -0.63% led by major healthcare-related stocks that have offshore operations where revenue can be dented due to a weaker USD seen in the past week. Share prices of CSL and Cochlear have declined by -1.1% and -0.8%, respectively.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 has managed to inch out a modest gain of 0.20% led by several major technology stocks reinforced by upbeat earnings from Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker. Murata Manufacturing, Fanuc, and Keyence have recorded gains between 1.3% to 2.4%.\n\nUp Next\n\nNo major economic data points today, so it\u2019s all about Brexit as we head towards the weekend.\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
