REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/\n\nThe company\u2019s shares, which were up after the bell on better-than-expected results, dropped about 5% on news of the postponement.\n\nSony\u2019s (6758.T) next-gen PlayStation \u201cPS5\u201d and Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) Xbox Project Scarlett are expected to launch next year during the holiday season.\n\n\u201cNew consoles are always an opportunity to drive more innovation in our EA Sports games\u201d Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wilson said on a post-earnings conference call.\n\nThe delay affects EA\u2019s full-year forecast for adjusted revenue that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe company is also hit by forex headwinds and delayed launch of a VR version of \u201cMedal of Honor\u201d for Oculus, the virtual reality company owned by Facebook Inc (FB.O), Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen told Reuters.\n\n\u201cSo the combination of those three things is roughly 100 plus million dollars and that weighed on our increasing guidance for the full year\u201d, Jorgensen added.\n\nFor the full year, EA expects adjusted revenue of about $5.13 billion, below estimates of $5.19 billion.\n\nThe postponement overshadowed EA\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly revenue that was boosted by the continued success of its battle royale sensation \u201cApex Legends\u201d.\n\nThe company said strong growth in EA Sports titles, that includes FIFA Ultimate Team as well as Sims 4, its life simulation franchise, boosted live services by 39% in the quarter, from a year earlier.\n\nThe beat comes at a time when console-based game franchises are competing with mobile-based, free-to-play games with engaging formats, challenging the dominance of traditional publishers like EA and its rivals Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO.O).\n\nEA, the company behind franchises like \u201cFIFA\u201d and \u201cBattlefield\u201d also expects current-quarter revenue above analyst estimates, boosted by excitement around its upcoming launches \u201cStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u201d and \u201cNeed For Speed: Heat\u201d.\n\nThe company expects adjusted revenue for the current quarter to be about $1.94 billion, edging past estimates of $1.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nEA is set to launch its new \u201cStar Wars\u201d title on Nov. 15 that follows the story of one of the last surviving Jedi. Its flagship racing series also gets a new title on Nov.8, whose initial trailer garnered over 8 million views.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, revenue rose 4.5% to $1.28 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectation of $1.25 billion.", "description": "Electronic Arts Inc has postponed the release of its basketball game NBA Live to coincide it with the launch of new gaming consoles next year, the video game publisher said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Ayanti Bera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446291264&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1RZ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
