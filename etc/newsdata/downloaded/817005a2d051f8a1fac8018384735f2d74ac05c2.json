The liberals organized a massive rally last Saturday to support Justice Minister Cho Kuk and denounce investigations into his family. On Thursday, a massive protest took place to condemn President Moon Jae-in\u2019s decision to appoint Cho and demand Cho\u2019s resignation.\u201cThe National Assembly has abandoned the livelihoods of the people and is buried in political power struggles,\u201d Moon Hee-sang said. \u201cThe people wouldn\u2019t even blink if the National Assembly disappeared today.\u201dHe said the politics of instigation have reached a dangerous limit, and lawmakers must answer to the people\u2019s will.The ruling and opposition parties remain split on Friday in their responses to Thursday\u2019s massive rally in downtown Seoul.The ruling Democratic Party (DP) criticized the main opposition Liberty Korea Party (LKP) for having mobilized people from around the nation to fuel political strife. \u201cThe LKP mobilized its members from around the country, and other reactionary, religious, political forces joined them,\u201d DP Chairman Lee Hae-chan said Friday. \u201cIt was chaos. The LKP must repent its irresponsible instigation.\u201dSome DP members admitted they were honestly shocked by the immense turnout. \u201cWe\u2019ve organized many rallies,\u201d said a key DP official. \u201cEven if the LKP mobilized all its members, we have to admit that the number of protesters showed that it was a heated rally.\u201dThe LKP said Friday that the rally was supported by an angry public. \u201cOrdinary people gave up their holiday and attended the protest,\u201d Rep. Na Kyung-won, floor leader of the LKP, said Friday. \u201cIt was a rare moment in the history of politics. The silent, shy centrists and rightists decided to raise their voices.\u201dThe Blue House remained silent about Thursday\u2019s anti-administration protest. After last Saturday\u2019s pro-administration rally, a senior presidential aide said, \u201cA large number of people gathered unexpectedly. We have to seriously consider the fact that so many people held candles together and made one voice.\u201dBY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
