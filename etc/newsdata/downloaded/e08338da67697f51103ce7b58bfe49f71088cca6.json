I know that all these hipster gourmet burger joints have popped up recently, but none of them will ever get close to topping this miracle. From its taste balance, to its texture and warm feeling when you hold it tight in the palm of your hand - it's literally perfect,' Bouchet told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nRoyalty Tier\n\nControversially, Bouchet placed Filet-O-Fish, Big Mac and Chicken 'n' Cheese in the 'Royalty Tier'.\n\n'The Chicken 'n' Cheese burger proves that a subpar burger (the McChicken) can be improved with the slightest of changes. Removing the flavourless and boring lettuce and replacing it with a simple slice of cheese is enough to make the Chicken 'n' Cheese a top-shelf burger. The great thing about it is that the grilled bun is smaller than the chicken patty so it's all about that beautiful combination of chicken, the creamy mayonnaise and the salty cheese slice,' he explained.\n\n'The Big Mac is still one of the most extraordinary burgers you can ever experience. It's all due to the top-secret Big Mac sauce whose sweet and tangy taste balances out the meat and the acidic pickles and onions. It would've been God Tier if it weren't for the fact that it's often served up lop-sided and with lettuce all over the cardboard packaging.'\n\nBouchet described the Filet-O-Fish as the 'most underrated and misunderstood burger on the menu'.\n\n'A combination of the bizarre name and the unsexiness of fish has scared many customers away. The reality, though, is that the Filet-o-Fish is perfectly designed with that crunchy fish filet supported by a perfectly dispensed dollop of tartar sauce and slice of American cheese.'\n\nAfter working as a crew trainer for the fast food giant for two years, Bouchet has used his insider's knowledge to compile his list of what he believes to be the ultimate ranking\n\nAdam Sandler Tier (take it or leave it)\n\nIn the centre of his rankings, Bouchet listed the Double Cheeseburger, McChicken and Classic Angus in the 'Adam Sandler Tier', or what he describes as the 'take it or leave it' category.\n\n'The McChicken is one of the most beloved burgers on the menu, however, the bun is simply too saggy to be able to enjoy the burger without having lettuce and sauce drop everywhere. When driving, it's almost impossible to eat it with one hand. The mayonnaise combination with the chicken patty and the lettuce works well but the patty lets the burger down with its lack of flavour and soggy texture,' he said.\n\n'In hindsight, I should've ranked the Classic Angus lower than I did. It was created to please the hipster-gourmet crowd and is everything that's wrong with burgers.\n\n'My fellow burger lovers would agree that we don't want good quality or healthy ingredients, we demand taste! It's important not to order the Classic Angus so that McDonald's is reminded that we want old-school fast food burgers, not some abomination that would be featured on MasterChef.'\n\nPleb Tier\n\nThe Sydney father-of-one has ranked 13 popular burgers from 'God Tier' to the 'Cat Vomit Tier'\n\nIn the second last tier, titled 'Pleb', Bouchet named the Quarter Pounder, McFeast and Double beef 'n' bacon.\n\n'Don't let the Quarter Pounder's name fool you, it's only 110 grams which is about the weight of an orange. It tastes like the try-hard version of the cheeseburger,' he said.\n\n'The meat patties on the bigger burgers like the Quarter Pounder don't taste anywhere near as good as the ones on cheeseburgers and Big Macs.'\n\nBouchet said there's 'too much going on' with the McFeast burger.\n\n'With burgers, more doesn't mean better. The biggest mistake with burgers is adding sliced tomato. Tomatoes distract from the stars of the burger show: the meat, sauces and bread texture. The McFeast is a fail is should be immediately discontinued by McDonalds,' he said.\n\nWould Rather Eat a Bucket of Cat Vomit Tier\n\nLastly, the 'Would Rather Eat a Bucket of Cat Vomit Tier' included the Junior Burger, BBQ Bacon Angus and Triple Cheeseburger.\n\n'The original cheeseburger is perfect. It seems greedy to triple stack the cheeseburger. This was invented to cash in on the cheeseburger's success, rather than serving up a burger that has its own taste journey and that will impress diners. You'd be better off ordering individual cheeseburgers than a double of triple cheeseburger,' Bouchet said.\n\nHe said the 'Junior' bun and the cheeseburger are practically the same but there's one core ingredient missing.\n\n'The Junior burger doesn't have that one slice of American cheese. McDonald's has essentially taken their greatest burger, removed one its most essential ingredients and thought that customers would somehow enjoy it. Big mistake, get rid of it,' he said.", "description": "A father who sparked debate over his controversial rankings of chocolate bars and ice creams has shared his new definitive list of McDonald's burgers.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/05/19522698-0-image-a-13_1570681010683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
