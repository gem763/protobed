We\u2019re beating retreat in Syria, and it is easy to see the upside of that for Erdo\u011fan, and for the Assad regime, and for Vladimir Putin and the Iranians, who wish to see the Assad regime endure. One can even see a little something it in for China.\n\nBut what\u2019s in it for the United States?
