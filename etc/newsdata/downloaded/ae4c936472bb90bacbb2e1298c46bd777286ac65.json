Her record-breaking single, Truth Hurts topped the charts, and her performances of the song at events like the MTV Video Music Awards garnered her famous fans like Rihanna and more.\n\nHowever the fairytale story, has a twist. In early 2018, before the song became a viral sensation, British performer, Mina Lioness claimed credit for the phrase, citing her own viral tweet from the previous year. Then last week claims of plagiarism were brought against Lizzo by producer Justin Raisen, according to Stereogum.\n\nSEE MORE ABOUT THAT HERE:\n\nNow Lizzo has released a statement - on Wednesday - referencing both dramas on her Instagram. The 31-year-old said: \"The men who now claim a piece of Truth Hurts did not help me write any part of the song,\".\n\nShe elaborated: \"They had nothing to with the line or how I chose to sing it. There was no one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears. That song is my life, and its words are my Truth.\" About Mina's claims, she said: \"The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with...not these men. Period\".\n\nSEE THAT FULL POST HERE:\n\nCompiled by Alex Isaacs.
