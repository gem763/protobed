The design of the city included designated residential and public areas, streets and alleys, the Israel Antiquities Authority said.\n\nAbout four million fragments were found at the site, including rare figurines of humans and animals, pieces of pottery and various tools, some of which came from Egypt.\n\nImage copyright Israeli Antiquities Authority Image caption Authorities said the figurines offer valuable insight into the spiritual life of the community\n\nImage copyright Israeli Antiquities Authority Image caption Some of the figurines have been preserved with great detail\n\nBurnt animal bones found on the site provided evidence of sacrificial offerings. Inhabitants of the city - who were likely drawn to the area by two fresh water springs, fertile land and proximity to trade routes - made their living from agriculture, trading with different regions and cultures.\n\nArcheologists had been excavating the site for more than two and a half years, with 5,000 teenagers and volunteers participating. The settlement was discovered during excavations preceding the construction of a new road.\n\nImage copyright Israeli Antiquities Authority Image caption About 5,000 teenagers and volunteers have contributed to the excavation, which has been going on for over two and half years\n\n.", "description": "The 5,000-year-old city is said to be one of the most significant archaeological finds in the region from that era.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5FA2/production/_109128442_3aeade62-706d-4875-bf70-117c96a07e62.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
