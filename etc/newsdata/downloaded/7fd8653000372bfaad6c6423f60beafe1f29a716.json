The release further explains:\n\n\u201cUpon activation users will get their own sort code and account number, which means that the transfers will bear the account holder\u2019s name, not Cryptopay. This is especially important as some banks may block crypto-related transactions resulting in money getting stuck with no way to withdraw.\u201d\n\nExpansion to new services and territories\n\nCurrently, the company is working on its European card program, having already begun issuance of prepaid cards in Russia. By the end of 2019, Cryptopay is planning to launch a range of other services such as ERC20 tokens wallet and exchange, Bitcoin (BTC) brokerage, and Bitcoin bank accounts.\n\nLast January, news broke that Visa ended its working relationship with debit card provider WaveCrest, also affecting crypto card products provided by CryptoPay, Bitwala, Wirex and others. The move first appeared to be a company crackdown on crypto services but was later revealed to be due to WaveCrest violating Visa\u2019s policies.\n\nCrypto-payment startups continue to enjoy recognition\n\nYesterday, OmiseGo, a finance-oriented scaling network for Ethereum, partnered with Hydro Labs. The cooperation between the companies aims to streamline Hydro Pay Ethereum-based transactions.\n\nSamsung Pay, the mobile payments service of South Korean tech giant Samsung, announced a partnership with payments platform Finablr, Ripple\u2019s RippleNet member, to offer cross-border payments feature Money Transfer to its app\u2019s users. Samsung Pay\u2019s United States-based clients reportedly can use their debit or credit cards to send money via the service.", "description": "Crypto wallet and debit card service company Cryptopay now offers transfers with the British Pound through the Faster Payments Scheme", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODQxYzFmM2Y2NzZhZmJlNzYzOThjODk4MDQ1NWJmZmIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
