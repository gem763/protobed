Neither throws blocks to slow relentless pass rushers like Khalil Mack & Co. Neither is susceptible to violations for holding, offsides, interference, or other various infractions among Washington\u2019s nine penalties against the Bears.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether Haskins would\u2019ve led Washington to victory. Three games into an 0-3 season that nearly everyone predicted, the starting quarterback in that trifecta is beside the point. Haskins easily could have the same record as Keenum in burgundy and gold.\n\nNo, the issue is whether keeping Haskins on the bench is best for him and best for the team, not necessarily in that order.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t think we had a chance to get better, then I would make a change,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said when asked about the possibility of switching his starting quarterback.\n\nGruden said continuity is important, that he \u201ccan\u2019t be changing people every five minutes.\u201d He mentioned that Keenum is new to the offense, as are several other starters on that side of the ball. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be perfect,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we need to be better.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the rival New York Giants \u2014 up next on Sunday \u2014 have already transitioned to quarterback Daniel Jones, their 2019 first-round draft pick. The Jacksonville Jaguars are playing their rookie QB, Gardner Minshew, out of necessity due to injury. Rookie QB Kyler Murray has started for the Arizona Cardinals since snap one.\n\nA youth movement is overtaking the league at the game\u2019s most important position. Several teams in Washington\u2019s position (expected to go nowhere) have given the reins to youngsters.\n\nYet Haskins, the No. 15 pick. is stuck on the bench behind Keenum.\n\nGranted, Monday was Keenum\u2019s first true clunker. He finished with 331 passing yards and two touchdowns, leading a comeback attempt that fizzled when he fumbled on a fourth-and-one quarterback sneak. As in the first two games, a portion of his statistics was padding, empty numbers accrued during the contest\u2019s non-competitive segment.\n\nBut he protected the ball superbly against Philadelphia and Dallas, which obviously didn\u2019t happen against Chicago.\n\n\u201cTo turn it over that many times as a quarterback, I let my team down,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cI really have to take complete responsibility. I have to take care of the ball better. That\u2019s my number one job.\u201d\n\nWhen a switch is made, the task will fall to Haskins. There are no guarantees he\u2019ll perform better than Keenum. Ugly sacks and multiple turnovers seemingly are part of a quarterback\u2019s initiation process.\n\nThe primary concern \u2014 depending on whom you ask \u2014 isn\u2019t Washington\u2019s 2019 win total under Haskins. It\u2019s how 2019 affects Haskins\u2018 development moving forward. Gruden\u2019s position is clear because he\u2019s coaching for his job; he believes Keenum provides the best chance to win now.\n\nBut the fans who chanted for Haskins on Monday aren\u2019t convinced. At worse, they figure the win probability would remain about the same. Fine. At least Haskins represents something new, bright and shiny, a breath of fresh air for a franchise and fan base that\u2019s suffocating.\n\nThe downside could be devastating if folks like former \u2018Skins Joe Theismann and Shawn Springs are correct. They have argued that Haskins should continue to sit, lest he become damaged goods playing for an unfinished product.\n\nFor now, there\u2019s no real heat to play Haskins. The same will be true even if Washington loses against Jones and the Giants, because New England is next. That means the \u2018Skins could be 0-5 when they visit Miami on Oct. 13.\n\nPerhaps Keenum can lead Washington to victory against the Dolphins. Big deal.\n\nHaskins can probably do that, too.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be much longer before we get to find out.\n\n\u2022 Brooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
