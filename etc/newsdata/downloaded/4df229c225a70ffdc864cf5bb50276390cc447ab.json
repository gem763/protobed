(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)\n\nJared Kushner, senior adviser and son-in-law to President Trump, responded to former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s claim that he was unqualified to serve in the White House in a recent interview, telling an Israeli journalist that he\u2019s spent his time in the administration addressing problems of Biden\u2019s making.\n\nDuring a Sunday 60 Minutes interview, Biden said that Kushner and his wife Ivanka were \u201cengaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about. Asked specifically about Kushner\u2019s handling of a substantial foreign policy portfolio, Biden responded, \u201cWhat credentials does he bring to that?\u201d\n\nThe White House released a statement in response to Biden\u2019s comments, which challenged the former vice president\u2019s characterization of Kushner\u2019s role in the White House.\n\nTrump campaign puts out statement defending Jared and Ivanka's White House positions after Joe Biden's \"60 Minutes\" interview. pic.twitter.com/GBo4iH7w5u \u2014 Natasha Korecki (@natashakorecki) October 25, 2019\n\nKushner argued that Biden lacks the credibility to criticize his qualifications during an exclusive interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 13 News released Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his opinion, but a lot of the work that the president has had me doing over the last three years has actually been cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind,\u201d Kushner said.\n\nExclusive: In first public comment on impeachment Jared Kushner tells me Trump's \"record of accomplishments is unimpeachable\" \u2013 my story on @axios and @newsisrael13 https://t.co/MJAh4HzVhm pic.twitter.com/aD51GR1YsL \u2014 Barak Ravid (@BarakRavid) October 29, 2019\n\nThe White House adviser pushed back specifically on Biden\u2019s foreign policy claim.\n\n\u201cWe inherited an ISIS caliphate, Iran was strong, Libya was a mess and a lot of our allies felt abandoned. We worked very hard over the last three years to try and rebuild the Middle East and to put it in a much more stable framing,\u201d he said.\n\nKushner also specifically cited criminal justice reform as an example of the work he\u2019s undertaken to reverse Biden\u2019s policy legacy, saying the current administration \u201crolled back a lot of the very harsh laws that were created and partially written by Vice President Biden over 20 years ago, which put a lot of African Americans in prison and really destroyed a generation and did a lot of harm to our country.\u201d", "description": "Jared Kushner responded to former vice president Joe Biden's claim that he was unqualified to serve in the White House in a recent interview.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
