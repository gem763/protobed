With everything having fallen apart, and his marriage to Moira on the rocks, he\u2019s set to make a big decision \u2014 and it\u2019s one that involves Amy Wyatt (Natalie Ann Jamieson).\n\nAfter Faith (Sally Dexter) informed him that Moira had been having an affair, Cain set about seeking revenge, and discovered that the mystery man his wife had been sleeping with was farmhand Nate. However, before he could carry out his revenge, Cain was stunned when Nate revealed himself to be his long-lost son.\n\nFaith later confirmed Nate\u2019s claims, revealing that she knew that Cain\u2019s ex, Cara Robinson, was pregnant, and kept it from him many years ago. Cain struggled to process this news, and disowned his mum as a result, before making Moira\u2019s affair public knowledge by revealing it in the Woolpack \u2014 a revelation which left Amy horrified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Moira has attempted to save her marriage, but Cain\u2019s simply not interested and she\u2019s left further upset when he makes a decision in the coming episodes.\n\nAmy suggests that getting away for a few days could do Cain the world of good, and thus she asks him to come away with her and Kyle. Cain\u2019s not so sure at first, but eventually he agrees to do so \u2014 much to Moira\u2019s dismay. However, when Moira voices her opinions, Cain removes his wedding ring.\n\nIs this really the end of Cain and Moira\u2019s marriage?\n\nThe removal of one\u2019s wedding ring speaks volumes, that\u2019s for sure, and Cain\u2019s actions certainly seem to suggest he\u2019s no intention of getting his marriage back on track any time soon.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Amy has made her opinion on Moira\u2019s actions known, so is she simply being nice to Cain or does she have an ulterior motive?\n\nEither way, Moira will no doubt be devastated at Cain\u2019s decision to leave.\n\nEmmerdale continues on Monday 28thOctober at 7pm on ITV.\n\nMORE: Cain Dingle discovers the full truth about Nate Robinson tonight\n\nMORE: Can Cain Dingle accept Nate Robinson is his son after boat explosion?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After everything that has transpired with Moira and Nate, Cain makes a big decision.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cain-dingle-and-amy-wyatt-in-emmerdale_1572009732.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
