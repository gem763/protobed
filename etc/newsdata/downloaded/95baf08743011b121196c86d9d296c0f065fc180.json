Our position on climate change is similarly clear. Since 2007, we have operated as a carbon neutral company and for the second year in a row, we reached 100% renewable energy for our global operations.\u201d\n\nEarther asked Google which part of each climate-denying organisation\u2019s agenda it does support, but we did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nIn a strange defence for Google\u2019s contributions to organisations that seemingly undermine its own public-facing policies\u2014including its commitment to renewable energy and its sponsorship of climate action-focused events\u2014the spokesperson added that Google is \u201chardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy.\u201d While we can\u2019t vouch for every claim that Google makes in its statement, it is a fact that other companies do indeed regularly contribute to organisations that hope to advance humanity\u2019s extinction.\n\nAs limp a defence for Google\u2019s agenda as that rationale is, it is also sadly true. The Guardian noted in its report that Google is listed as a sponsor for the State Policy Network\u2019s (SPN) Annual Meeting, an event for which social media giant Facebook is also listed as a sponsor, as is Altria, which owns a minority stake in e-cigarette company and market titan Juul.\n\nAs the Guardian noted, SPN supports right-wing think tanks like the Heartland Institute, one of the most infamous sources of climate denial in the U.S. The group includes the bald-faced lie on its climate change webpage that \u201c[m]ost scientists do not believe human greenhouse gas emissions are a proven threat to the environment or to human well-being.\u201d In addition, Heartland Institute has trashed teen activist Greta Thunberg following her speech before the United Nations last month, and it hosts a number of climate denial confabs, including one last year in New Orleans that drew members of Congress and White House staffers as speakers.\n\nGoogle said it\u2019s transparent about its sponsorships and pointed to its contributions to progressive organisations like the Centre for American Progress. (Reminder: The Centre for American Progress is a disgrace.) It also claimed that sponsorship of the SPN event was an initiative led by its civics team to help people from varying political affiliations use its tools and products.\n\nStill, the SPN event would not be the first it\u2019s sponsored with denier ties. Google was also a platinum sponsor\u2014meaning it donated $US25,000 ($36,763)\u2014at LibertyCon, which featured an event that undermined climate science. (Microsoft and Facebook were also sponsors of the event.) And wouldn\u2019t you believe it, the Heartland Institute was a gold sponsor of the very same conference.\n\nHowever Google attempts to fit the square peg of its political agenda into the round hole of reality, the bottom line is that all of that public-facing rhetoric about climate action is essentially meaningless if one of the most powerful companies in the world are actively contributing to the misinformation that continues to undermine the future and health of our planet. So much for that whole \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d thing.", "description": "Despite all its evidently performative public-facing climate change initiatives, Google is forking over \u201csubstantial\u201d contributions to denier organisations and events....", "authors": ["Catie Keck On Earther", "Shared Brian Kahn To Gizmodo", "George Dvorsky", "Jennings Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zlulamp62boux44ackws.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
