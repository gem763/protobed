The company describes it as a \u201ccompetitively priced insurance offering designed to provide Tesla owners with up to 20 percent lower rates, and in some cases as much as 30 percent.\u201d Tesla\u2019s insurance will be available in California to start, and it will \u201cexpand to additional US states in the future,\u201d the company says, though no timetable was given.\n\nMusk originally claimed that Tesla would be able to offer such vast discounts on insurance for its cars because the company has access to reams of data that each one produces. In a blog post about the insurance product, Tesla says the company\u2019s advanced safety features, such as Autopilot, also contribute to the lower cost.\n\nMusk said Tesla\u2019s access to its cars\u2019 data gives the company an \u201cinformation arbitrage\u201d advantage\n\n\u201cWe essentially have an ... information arbitrage opportunity where we have direct knowledge of the risk profile of customers,\u201d Musk said in April. \u201cAnd then if they want to buy Tesla insurance, they would have to agree to not drive the car in a crazy way. Or they can, but then their insurance rates are higher.\u201d\n\nAll that said, Tesla explains that it \u201cdoes not use nor record vehicle data, such as GPS or vehicle camera footage, when pricing insurance.\u201d\n\nLower-priced insurance might seem like a tantalizing offering, but the cost to insure Tesla\u2019s cars is already a bit higher than average; the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ranked the Model S as the most expensive vehicle to insure in 2018.\n\nTesla promised existing customers in California the ability to purchase an insurance policy in \u201cas little as one minute\u201d on its website. New customers can request a quote, too.\n\nFor Tesla, offering insurance policies gives the company another chance to pad its margins as it searches for sustainable profitability. But if Tesla winds up having to pay out too many claims, it could also deplete the company\u2019s cash reserves.", "description": "The company promises 20 percent lower rates than competitors, but Tesla\u2019s cars tend to cost a lot to insure to begin with.
