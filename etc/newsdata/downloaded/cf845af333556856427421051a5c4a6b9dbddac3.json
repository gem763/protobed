A teenage boy, who subsisted on Pringles, French fries, processed pork and white bread for years, went blind due to his extremely poor diet, according to a case study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nAt 14-years-old, the teen, who was considered a \u201cfussy eater,\u201d told his family practitioner that he was feeling tired. While tests revealed he was anemic and had low vitamin B12 levels, his doctor didn\u2019t notice the teen\u2019s severe lack of nutrition \u2014 likely because the adolescent had \u201cno visible signs of malnutrition,\u201d according to ScienceDaily. He also had a normal BMI and height. The teen was given vitamin B12 shots, told to eat a healthy diet, and was sent on his way.\n\nA year later, the teen returned to the doctor\u2019s office with hearing loss and vision problems, but doctors couldn\u2019t pinpoint the exact cause. His vision problems got progressively worse. By 17 years old, he was suffering from blindness.\n\nResearchers at The University of Bristol believe the teen\u2019s junk food diet led to nutritional optic neuropathy \u2014 a condition caused by a lack of nutrients, which impairs the normal functioning of nerve fibers and leads to optic nerve dysfunction.\n\n\u201cNutritional optic neuropathy is usually caused by a deficiency of B-complex vitamins (thiamine, B12, etc.),\u201d Randy McLaughlin, an optometrist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cIt\u2019s usually seen in alcoholics, who are malnourished. This condition is somewhat rare, but not totally uncommon.\u201d The condition is painless and progresses gradually.\n\nWhen caught early, nutritional optic neuropathy is reversible \u2014 mainly by ramping up on folic acid, vitamin B complex, and protein. \u201cIt can be reversed with better nutrition,\u201d notes McLaughlin, \u201cHowever, improvement is seen on a case by case basis.\u201d If left untreated, the resulting blindness can become permanent.\n\nFor the teen, by the time he got a proper diagnosis and after years of extremely poor eating, the damage to his vision was permanent.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Denize Atan, PhD, says the case is an example of why physicians can\u2019t only rely on BMI readings to determine whether a patient is consuming a healthy diet. \"This case highlights the impact of diet on visual and physical health, and the fact that calorie intake and BMI are not reliable indicators of nutritional status,\" Atan, consultant senior lecturer in ophthalmology at Bristol Medical School and clinical lead for neuro-ophthalmology at Bristol Eye Hospital, told ScienceDaily.\n\nThe study\u2019s researchers recommend that, just like physicians ask about smoking and alcohol intake, dietary history should be part of any routine clinical examination.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The teen, considered a \"fussy eater,\" ate a very limited and unhealthy diet for years.
