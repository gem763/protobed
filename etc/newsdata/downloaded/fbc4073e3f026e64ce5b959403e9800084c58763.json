Justin Trudeau staying as prime minister is a diminished figure, not just internally but externally in terms of the image of Canada in the world Daniel Beland, McGill University political science\n\nThe Conservatives, on the other hand, played to their base and moaned that Mr Trudeau was ruining the country without offering any intelligent alternative.\n\nNational Post columnist Andrew Coyne summed up the mood of many Canadians two days before the election.\n\n\u201cCertainly neither of the two historic governing parties has begun to make the case for why they should be entrusted with power, as their sliding poll numbers reveal: if current trends hold, both will come in with less than a third of the vote, for the first time in our history,\u201d Mr Coyne wrote.\n\n\u201cThat is as much a tribute to their leaders as it is to their platforms: if the worst that can be said of Justin Trudeau is that he could not defeat a morally and intellectually vacuous marshmallow like Andrew Scheer, the worst that can be said of Scheer is that he could not defeat a preening fraud like Trudeau.\u201d\n\nAs Mr Scheer and Mr Trudeau snipped at each other like school boys, voters began to cast their eyes elsewhere.\n\nThe first stop was the socialist New Democratic Party and its charismatic leader, Jagmeet Singh.\n\nIn his colourful turbans and pleas for a better deal for average Canadians, the youthful Singh won plaudits from across the political spectrum.\n\nAt times during the bitter contest, he appeared to be the only adult in the room.\n\nNow, the ball is in his court.\n\nMr Trudeau will need to rely on Singh\u2019s NDP to preserve his precarious minority government status, and it will likely cost him in reforms and money for social programs.\n\nReturning from the dead was the separatist Bloc Quebecois who control 35 Quebec seats in the reconstituted parliament.\n\nBut the party\u2019s return reflects a broad dissatisfaction with the political status quo rather than any renewed taste for separatism whose support is at an all-time low.\n\nAlso making inroads was the Green Party as fears over the climate crisis grew, but while their vote numbers rose, their seat total nudged up only slightly.\n\nMr Trudeau has turned out to be a more conflicted politician than the progressive prince that left-leaning Canadians had hoped he would be.\n\nBut when his operatives portrayed rival Mr Scheer as Trump 2.0 poised to destroy all that was good about Canada, it was enough to get him re-elected.\n\nOne pundit suggests that the minority government Mr Trudeau will now preside over will be fairly long lasting.\n\nNeither Canadians nor their politicians are ready for another round at the voting booth, but both of the main parties emerged from the previous 40 days with a little less dignity.", "description": "Canada\u2019s progressive prince Justin Trudeau has managed to hold on to power, albeit of a minority government, in one of the most divisive elections in the country\u2019s history.
