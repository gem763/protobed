But the following year a now-discredited study was published linking the jab to autism. It prompted her mother to choose against giving her daughter the second jab\n\nAsked about why she chose not to give her daughter her second MMR, she said: 'Autism was in the newspapers at the time.\n\n'It was a great fear of mine because I had seen what autism could do. The facts were not really available at that time cos we\u2019re going back many moons ago.\n\nWHAT IS MEASLES, WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS AND HOW CAN YOU CATCH IT? Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that spreads easily from an infected person by coughing, sneezing or even just breathing. Symptoms develop between six and 19 days after infection, and include a runny nose, cough, sore eyes, a fever and a rash. The rash appears as red and blotchy marks on the hairline that travel down over several days, turning brown and eventually fading. Some children complain of disliking bright lights or develop white spots with red backgrounds on their tongue. In one in 15 cases, measles can cause life-threatening complications including pneumonia, convulsions and encephalitis. Dr Ava Easton, chief executive of the Encephalitis Society told MailOnline: 'Measles can be very serious. '[It] can cause encephalitis which is inflammation of the brain. 'Encephalitis can result in death or disability.' Treatment focuses on staying hydrated, resting and taking painkillers, if necessary. Measles can be prevented by receiving two vaccinations, the first at 13 months old and the second at three years and four months to five years old.

You can go and ask medical professionals.\u2019\n\nEllie was given her first MMR vaccination at three months old in 1994. But the following year a now-discredited study was published linking the jab to autism.\n\nDr Andrew Wakefield published a second paper in 1998 which he claimed backed up his initial study.\n\nThe research received widespread media coverage and contributed to the birth of the anti-vaccination movement.\n\nMrs Roscoe was put off giving Ellie the second dose of MMR in 1998 before she started school on the back of the controversial studies.\n\nBut, as it appeared to have no impact on her daughter's life, it never occurred to Mrs Roscoe that her daughter could have the virus when she took ill in 2017.\n\nIn the same year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared that Britain had eradicated measles.\n\nMrs Roscoe told the This Morning programme: '[We thought] measles had been eradicated. But because the vaccination levels have dropped considerably, it started becoming more prevalent.'\n\nCoverage of the MMR jab, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, fell for the fifth year in a row last year.\n\nIt means one in ten children are now not receiving their first dose of the vaccine.\n\nMeasles also increased to 301 cases over the same period, with nearly 266 of those in unvaccinated people aged 15 or over.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged \u2018bold action\u2019 to combat the plummeting vaccination rates.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it was considering a range of options to combat the decline \u2013 including mandatory vaccination.\n\nThis could force parents to prove their four or five-year-old has had their vaccinations before they can start school.\n\nMr Hancock has said he cannot rule out the possibility of banning unvaccinated children from schools and nurseries.\n\nBut there are concerns such a policy could mean vulnerable children are excluded from mainstream education.", "description": "Debbie Roscoe, from Birmingham, appeared on This Morning earlier today and revealed daughter Ellie was almost struck down with the virus in 2017 aged 23.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/14/19155170-0-image-a-7_1569935555131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
