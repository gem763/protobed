The stock has now tumbled 15% amid a 5-session losing streak, and has lost one-third of its value since the July 3 closing high of $381.72.\n\nIn the process, the price has fallen below a 3-year long uptrend line, and is on the verge of creating another bearish long-term technical pattern. (See charts below)\n\nAnalyst Jeff Wlodarczak at Pivotal Research affirmed the buy rating he\u2019s had on Netflix for at least the past three years, but lowered his price target by 32% to $350. His target was still 38% above current levels, but was now 11% below the average price target of $393.26, of the 40 analysts surveyed by FactSet.\n\nWlodarczak\u2019s previous price target of $515 was the highest of those surveyed by a wide margin, as the current highest target is now Imperial Capital analyst David Miller\u2019s target of $451, according to FactSet data.\n\nThe lowered target reflects \u201cmaterially higher than forecast content cost inflation,\u201d Wlodarczak wrote in a note to clients. He said the higher cost outlook is highlighted by what AT&T Inc. T, -0.59% paid for the exclusive streaming rights to carry the \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d TV show. In addition, he noted that the big internet players appear to be significantly ramping their advertising spend, which was highlighted by ads showing during the Emmy awards show over the weekend.\n\nSee related: \u2018Seinfeld\u2019 is coming to Netflix \u2014 all 180 episodes of it.\n\nAlso read: Everything coming to Netflix in September \u2014 and what\u2019s leaving.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop of accelerating industry spend we believe the right move for [Netflix] management is to also materially accelerate their spend,\u201d Wlodarczak wrote, which he believes is needed to maintain its \u201csizeable content lead\u201d on its peers, increase barriers to entry, reduce churn and maintain growth in subscribers and average revenue per user (ARPU). He said, however, that increased spending could temporary pressure margins and free cash flow.\n\nNetflix had reported in July second-quarter free cash flow of negative $593.8 million, up from negative $558.6 million in the same period a year ago. In its annual report out in January, Netflix reported 2018 free cash flow of negative $3.02 billion, compared with negative $2.02 billion in 2017, and said it expected negative free cash flow \u201cfor many years\u201d as it continues to \u201csignificantly increase\u201d investment in streaming content.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Opinion: Netflix stock is a buy right now \u2014 for these 10 reasons.\n\nAlso read: Netflix snags \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 creators away from HBO in mega-deal.\n\nWlodarczak kept his subscriber estimates mostly intact but raised his medium-term cost forecasts, as his assumption for annual cash outlay on programming was lifted to $35 billion in 2025 from $30 billion.\n\nHe also cut his 2019 earnings-per-share estimate to $3.64 from $3.93 and lowered his sales outlook to $20.18 billion from $20.20 billion.\n\n\u201cOur new forecasts imply [Netflix is] going to respond to content cost acceleration by revving up their own content spend that will allow them to maintain their subscriber growth while pushing back profitability materially,\u201d Wlodarczak wrote.\n\nIn the end, his view is that very few players will be able to keep up current spend levels, and that ultimately it will be a \u201c2-horse race,\u201d Netflix and Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Disney+, where both horses can win. Wlodarczak said he believes Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -2.45% will be on the periphery, and there is a reasonable shot that AT&T will screw up HBO as a competitor.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: \u2018Disney will win\u2019 streaming battle with Netflix: analyst.\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock has shed 31% over the past 12 months, while Disney shares DIS, -0.37% have climbed 17%, AT&T shares have gained 11% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.53% has edged up 1%.\n\nTrendline break ends 3-year uptrend\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock has fallen below a trendline on the weekly charts, that has defined the trajectory of the current uptrend going back to September 2016.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nOne of the six key tenets of the Dow Theory, which has remained relevant among technical analysts for over a century, is that a trend remains in effect until it gives a definite signal that it has reversed, according to the CMT Association. One of the simplest and widely used tools by chart watchers, to gauge when a trend has ended is a trendline.\n\nWhile the trendline break warns that Netflix\u2019s long-term stock uptrend appears to have ended, some chart watchers require a sign that a new downtrend has begun before turning fully bearish.\n\nAnother key Dow Theory tenet is that a downtrend is defined by a pattern of lower highs and lower lows.\n\nFactSet, MarketWatch\n\nNetflix\u2019s stock has already made a lower high, as the May 3 close of $385.03, the highest close of 2019, was well below the July 19, 2018 record close of $418.97. If the stock closes below the Dec. 24, 2018 close of $233.88, which at the time was an 11-month low, the lower low would complete the Dow Theory\u2019s definition of a downtrend.\n\nThe stock would have to decline another 7.7% from current levels to complete the pattern.", "description": "Shares of Netflix Inc. sank again Tuesday, enough to turn negative for this year, after the previously most-bullish analyst slashed his price target to below...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR965_Netfli_ZG_20190924141323.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
