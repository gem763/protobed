Biden.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky gathered a small group of advisers on May 7 in Kyiv for a meeting that was supposed to be about his nation\u2019s energy needs. Instead, the group spent most of the three-hour discussion talking about how to navigate the insistence from Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani for a probe and how to avoid becoming entangled in the American elections, according to three people familiar with the details of the meeting.\n\nThey spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, which has roiled U.S.-Ukrainian relations.\n\nThe meeting came before Zelensky was inaugurated but about two weeks after Trump called to offer his congratulations on the night of the Ukrainian leader\u2019s April 21 election.\n\nThe full details of what the two leaders discussed in that Easter Sunday phone call have never been publicly disclosed, and it is not clear whether Trump explicitly asked for an investigation of the Bidens.\n\nThe three people\u2019s recollections differ on whether Zelensky specifically cited that first call with Trump as the source of his unease. But their accounts all show the Ukrainian president-elect was wary of Trump\u2019s push for an investigation into the former vice president and his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings.\n\nEither way, the newly elected leader of a country wedged between Russia and the U.S.-aligned NATO democracies knew early on that vital military support might depend on whether he was willing to choose a side in an American political tussle. A former comedian who won office on promises to clean up corruption, Zelensky\u2019s first major foreign policy test came not from his enemy Russia, but rather from the country\u2019s most important ally, the United States.\n\nThe May 7 meeting included two of his top aides, Andriy Yermak and Andriy Bogdan, the people said. Also in the room was Andriy Kobolyev, head of the state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, and Amos Hochstein, an American who sits on the Ukrainian company\u2019s supervisory board. Hochstein is a former diplomat who advised Biden on Ukraine matters during the Obama administration.\n\nZelensky\u2019s office in Kyiv did not respond to messages on Wednesday seeking comment. The White House would not comment on whether Trump demanded an investigation in the April 21 call.\n\nThe White House has offered only a bare-bones public readout on the April call, saying Trump urged Zelensky and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms, increase prosperity and \u201croot out corruption.\u201d In the intervening months, Trump and his proxies have frequently used the word \u201ccorruption\u201d to reference the monthslong efforts to get the Ukrainians to investigate Democrats.\n\nTrump has said he would release a transcript of the first call, but the White House had no comment Wednesday on when, or if, that might happen.\n\nAfter news broke that a White House whistleblower had filed a complaint about his July 25 call with Zelensky, Trump said the conversation was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he had asked his Ukrainian counterpart to do \u201cwhatever he can in terms of corruption because the corruption is massive.\u201d\n\nDuring the call, Trump asked Zelensky for \u201ca favor,\u201d requesting an investigation into a conspiracy theory related to a Democratic computer server hacked during the 2016 election campaign. Trump also pushed Zelensiy to investigate Biden and his son. Trump then advised Zelensky that Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr would be contacting him about the request, according to a summary of the called released by the White House.\n\nWithin days, Giuliani flew to Madrid to meet privately with Yermak, Zelensky\u2019s aide who was in the May 7 meeting.\n\nTrump has denied that an investigation of Biden was a condition for releasing military aid as a quid pro quo. But on Tuesday, the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine at the time, Ambassador William Taylor, starkly contradicted the president, saying that Trump had demanded that everything Zelensky wanted, including the aid and a White House meeting, was conditional on a public vow that he would open an investigation.\n\nTaylor also detailed multiple previously undisclosed diplomatic interactions between Trump\u2019s envoys and senior Ukrainian officials in which the president\u2019s demand to investigate the Bidens in exchange for American aid was clear.\n\nThe continued flow of high-tech U.S. weaponry is seen as essential to the survival of the Ukrainian government, which has been mired in a long-running war with Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. In 2014, masked Russian troops took control of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. Russia later annexed it, provoking Western sanctions against Moscow.\n\nIn a joint Sept. 25 news conference with Trump at the United Nations in New York, Zelensky denied he felt pressured to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved, to democratic, open elections of U.S.A.,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said. \u201cWe had, I think, good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I think, and you read it, that nobody push it. Push me.\u201d\n\nTrump then chimed in: \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d\n\nBefore Zelensky was elected, however, a public campaign to initiate investigations into the Bidens was already underway.\n\nFor weeks, conservative media outlets in the U.S. had trumpeted unfounded accusations that Biden, the Obama administration\u2019s top envoy to the war-torn former Soviet republic, had sought the removal of the country\u2019s top prosecutor in order to stymie an investigation in Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that later hired his son to serve on its board.\n\nBoth Trump and Giuliani made public comments and tweets referencing the Biden accusations, with the president\u2019s lawyer suggesting in a Fox News interview on April 7 that the U.S. Justice Department should investigate the matter.\n\nOne day before Zelensky\u2019s May 7 meeting with his advisers, the U.S. State Department recalled Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, a career diplomat with a reputation for combating corruption. Yovanovitch had been the target of a sustained yearlong smear campaign by Giuliani and his associates.\n\nWhen Trump called Zelensky on July 25 to congratulate the Ukrainian president on \u201ca great victory\u201d after his Servant of the People party won control of Ukrainian parliament, Zelensky downplayed his discomfort.\n\n\u201cThe first time, you called me to congratulate me when I won my presidential election, and the second time you are now calling me when my party won the parliamentary election,\u201d Zelensky said, according to the rough transcript. \u201cI think I should run more often so you can call me more often, and we can talk over the phone more often.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBiesecker reported from Washington.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "More than two months before the phone call that launched the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Ukraine's newly elected leader was already worried about pressure from the U.S. president to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Desmond Butler", "Michael Biesecker"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/ukraine_impeachment_prosecutors_60596_c0-0-2500-1458_s1200x700.jpg?99c7ae3bdbf327c408533720fb3c8c1f3a8a793f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
