But its successful censorship of U.S. businesses generally involves websites, app stores, social media. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the National Basketball Association\u2019s supine behavior toward China in the past week \u2014 from what is supposedly the most progressive and politically engag\u00e9 of the American professional sports leagues \u2014 followed from a general manager fleetingly expressing support for the Hong Kong protesters on Twitter. Likewise when China induced Marriott to fire a luckless $14-an-hour worker recently, it was for seeming to endorse Tibetan independence by \u201cfavoriting\u201d a tweet. Having figured out how to tame their internet, the Chinese are intent on using commercial power to tame ours.\n\nHow afraid should this make us? One possibility is that just as Chimerican optimism was once delusional, so now Chimerican fears are overblown. The Chinese regime has capabilities that outstrip Soviet Russia, but deep weaknesses as well. China\u2019s demographic picture is potentially disastrous, its economic surge may be leveling off, many of its best and brightest are eager to depart, and it has more to lose than America from constant trade brinksmanship, a trans-Pacific Cold War footing. As with fears of Japanese dominance in the 1990s, some Sinophobes may overrate the internal strength of the Chinese model, the permanence of its ascent.\n\nBut one can believe that China may be somewhat weaker than it looks and also believe that the fear of the People\u2019s Republic is a healthy thing for Americans to cultivate. For one thing, our policy approach to Chinese power clearly needs adjustment, and yet there are many high-dollar reasons for our elite to protect their Chimerican entanglements \u2014 with \u201celite\u201d here including not only the influence-peddlers of D.C. and Silicon Valley, but also figures like Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, whose professional obligations induced him to draw shameful analogies between America\u2019s sins and Chinese totalitarianism this week.\n\nGiven those elite incentives, the only way our China policy will be permanently adjusted is if the outrage that bubbled against the N.B.A. in recent days becomes a permanent factor in American politics, a sentiment that cannot be ignored.", "description": "As the N.B.A. defers to Beijing, a little more Western paranoia might be advantageous.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/opinion/13Douthat1/13Douthat1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
