Bulls--t! I don't give a damn about these soft rules protecting QBs. Im gonna play MY brand of football everytime I step on the field. SMH.\"\n\nThe Browns faced a 3rd-and-8 midway through the first quarter. Quarterback Baker Mayfield rolled out to his left and tossed an incomplete pass in the face of Adams' oncoming rush.\n\nHowever, referees called a roughing-the-passer penalty on the Jets safety when Adams pushed Mayfield soon after the signal-caller threw the ball.\n\nCleveland ended the drive with a field goal en route to a 23-3 win. To make matters worse, Adams revealed to WFAN's Maggie Gray and Bart Scott that he was benched (h/t Manish Mehta of the New York Daily News):\n\nAccording to NFL reporter Dov Kleiman, Adams also unfollowed the Jets on Instagram and removed mention of the team from his biography.\n\nThe talented 23-year-old out of LSU was the sixth overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft. He shined last year, amassing 115 tackles, 3.5 sacks and 12 pass breakups.\n\nPro Football Focus placed the Pro Bowler on its first team and gave him the third-best grade among players who participated in at least 80 percent of defensive snaps. He also finished the season as PFF's 20th-best player overall.\n\nAlthough Adams fared well, the Jets did not as they struggled to a 4-12 season. Still, some optimism crept into the Meadowlands thanks to rookie quarterback Sam Darnold's late-season surge, the drafting of superstar rookie defensive lineman Quinnen Williams and the offseason arrivals of running back Le'Veon Bell, linebacker C.J. Mosley and wideout Jamison Crowder, among others.\n\nHowever, everything that could go wrong has for the Jets this season.\n\nA 16-0 lead against the Buffalo Bills in Week 1 ended with a 17-16 loss. Kicker Kaare Vedvik, who missed a field goal and an extra point, was cut after the game.\n\nThen, Darnold was declared out for an undetermined period of time with mononucleosis, Mosley and Williams missed the Browns game with injuries and backup signal-caller Trevor Siemian suffered a horrific leg injury during Week 2.\n\nThe Browns also just beat the Jets by 20 points in a game where Cleveland wideout Odell Beckham Jr. caught six passes for 161 yards and a touchdown days after New York defensive coordinator Gregg Williams suggested he wasn't a \"dynamic\" player.\n\nThe NFL season is a marathon, and 14 games remain. However, frustrations are clearly boiling over for Adams and the Jets, who now travel to New England to face the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.", "description": "New York Jets  safety Jamal Adams' tough week only got worse after the  NFL  fined him $21,000 for a roughing-the-passer penalty against the  Cleveland Browns  on Monday...", "authors": ["Paul Kasabian"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/828/903/hi-res-16e0f8fe5ff4ca75c166c787a0c7b118_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
