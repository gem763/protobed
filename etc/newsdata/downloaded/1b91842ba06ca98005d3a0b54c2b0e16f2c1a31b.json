REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nTrump headed on Monday to Fayetteville, a city in North Carolina\u2019s 9th Congressional District, to rally Republican supporters in a repeat election of a 2018 contest that was tainted by fraud. Both Republicans and Democrats expect the results on Tuesday to be close and to provide clues about what is ahead in presidential and congressional elections next year.\n\n\u201cLooking forward to being in the North Carolina tomorrow night. We\u2019re having a BIG RALLY for a great guy, Dan Bishop,\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday, referring to the Republican nominee, a 55-year-old state senator who has embraced Trump\u2019s policies and some of his political tactics. Bishop\u2019s campaign says the most important issues are taxes, the economy and immigration.\n\nOpinion polling indicates a tight race, with turnout an important factor.\n\n\u201cIt was a very close race,\u201d Trump said at the White House before leaving for Fayetteville. He said he believed Bishop had a good chance of winning and that the contest had become \u201cless close\u201d since his own involvement began about two weeks ago. Trump stressed, however, that \u201cI\u2019m not running.\u201d\n\nTrump has personally called North Carolina\u2019s Republican party chairman several times for updates on the campaign, a Republican involved in the special election said.\n\nThe sprawling 9th District, a combination of suburban and rural areas stretching south and east of the city of Charlotte, has been represented by Republicans for decades, and voted for Trump by about 12 percentage points in 2016. A Republican loss would be a worrisome sign for the president and his party.\n\nBut Democrats are daring to hope for an upset by their candidate, Dan McCready, that would build on their takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives from Republicans in elections last year and make further inroads in \u201cTrump country.\u201d\n\n\u2018ALL ABOUT TURNOUT\u2019\n\nThe national press secretary for Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign, Kayleigh McEnany, said the campaign did not buy into the narrative that the 9th District election, whatever the results, was predictive of the 2020 campaign.\n\n\u201cThe president is not on the ballot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference when he is.\u201d\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence was campaigning for Bishop on Monday, making remarks at a \u201cGet out the Vote\u201d event with the candidate in the town of Wingate. He was to join Trump later in Fayetteville.\n\nPence also visited a call centre for Bishop, where the vice president told the party workers: \u201cIt\u2019s all about turnout. Elections are won by the people that show up.\u201d\n\nBishop\u2019s campaign ads have said McCready \u201cadmires socialism\u201d and linked him to the \u201cSquad,\u201d a group of progressive House Democrats that Trump has repeatedly attacked.\n\nMcCready, 36, a small-businessman and U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has focused his race on healthcare, education and the pay of North Carolina teachers.\n\n\u201cHe (Bishop) is not running against a socialist, he\u2019s running against a capitalist, who\u2019s built a business from scratch,\u201d McCready told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s running against a United States Marine.\u201d\n\nThe district was already getting more competitive in 2018 when McCready lost narrowly before state officials ruled the election was marred by an absentee-ballot fraud scheme that benefited McCready\u2019s then-opponent, Republican Mark Harris. A new election was ordered, and Harris declined to run again.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is going all-out to try to keep a North Carolina district in the Republican column in a special congressional election on Tuesday that may serve as a bellwether for his own fortunes in 2020.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1428008641&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881FO", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
