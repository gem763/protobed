She dispatched her student Laura Hernandez to purchase tea bags from stores in the area and bring them back to the lab.\n\nAD\n\nIt turns out Tufenkji\u2019s hunch was right. The bags were releasing plastic particles into the brewed tea. Billions and billions of them.\n\nAD\n\nHernandez, Tufenkji and their fellow researchers at McGill University tested four kinds of plastic tea bags in boiling water, and found that a single bag would release more than 11 billion microplastic and 3 billion nanoplastic particles. You would not be able to see the contamination with your own eyes; the researchers had to use an electron microscope. But it\u2019s there.\n\nTheir findings were published in the American Chemical Society journal Environmental Science & Technology this month.\n\nGone in a Generation: How climate change is impacting America\n\nThe four brands of tea they tested came from regular grocery stores in Montreal. After emptying and cleaning the tea bags of any trace of tea leaves, they submerged them in water heated to 203 degrees Fahrenheit, and then they left the bags to steep for five minutes.\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers then examined the water for leftover particles, placing drops on a slide and examining them under an electron microscope. There, they could see particles of varying sizes, some a little larger, some frighteningly small. Further testing of additional samples revealed their structures and confirmed that the material was made of the same plastic materials as PET, a kind of polyester, and nylon. It was clear, Tufenkji said, that the plastic was coming from the tea bags themselves, not the tea.\n\nAD\n\nThough Tufenkji declined to name the brands they used for fear of singling out one company over others, she said that some frequent tea drinkers could be repeatedly dosing themselves with billions of particles of plastic as they drank the beverage day after day. Some of the particles, she noted, would be small enough to potentially infiltrate human cells.\n\nSome manufacturers sell tea in plastic bags rather than loose or in paper bags, even as the public becomes increasingly aware of how plastic is clogging our bodies of water, as well as our bodies. While the health implications of consuming plastic are unknown, people around the world are inadvertently eating quite a lot of it.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this year, a report by the World Wide Fund for Nature estimated that on average, a person might ingest 5 grams of plastic a week, the equivalent size of a credit card. Researchers at the University of Newcastle in Australia compiled dozens of studies on the presence of plastic in water, as well as in food such as shellfish and even beer. Studies are underway to establish how plastic consumption can affect human health, according to WWF\u2019s study.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the McGill study did not explore the human health effects of consuming this plastic, when some of the particles were given to water fleas, they began acting erratically and developed some deformities, Tufenkji said.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to make the public aware of this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want consumers to know that this is made of plastic so they can have the choice about whether this is really what they want to purchase.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nA glacier in the Alps might collapse, thanks to global warming, officials say\n\nWhen it comes to acknowledging humans\u2019 role in climate change, oil and gas industry lawyer says \u2018that ship has sailed'\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nHow marijuana is competing with wine \u2014 and not just for customers\n\nWineries were already dealing with a labor shortage.

But nearly 80 percent of movie critics are men.\n\nGet smart about how climate change affects your sleep\n\nThe hotter it gets, the harder it is for your body to cool as you try to sleep. A 2017 study looks at CDC survey about sleep and matches it up to weather station records to determine if Americans are feeling unusual night temperatures.\n\nAD", "description": "If that's not your cup of tea, consider buying loose-leaf varieties.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Sl7zOIBNVjudvEXB-CCc2y9Iups=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VVTHOPHBJUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
