China Shangzhen Fan/Wildlife Photographer of the Year\n\nDr Michael Stratigos of the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, who is working on a project investigating iron age crannogs in Loch Tay in the northern Cairngorms, told The Independent the low water levels presented a rare opportunity to see more of the crannog at Loch Vaa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a site I\u2019d had on my radar as something of interest during my PhD a few years back, but never got around to investigating it.\n\n\u201cSo when I heard that the water levels had dropped, it was a good chance to investigate it \u2013 not only because it makes the archaeological material more accessible, but also [because it allowed them] to assess whether the archaeological deposits had been negatively affected.\n\n\u201cSo I got in touch with the landowners and the local authorities to go to have a look.\u201d\n\nThe work included taking a sample of one of the timbers used at the crannog for radiocarbon dating.\n\n\u201cIt seems as though the water levels had dropped to that position before,\u201d Dr Stratigos said, and explained this was indicated by a complete absence of organic matter surviving at the level the timber was retrieved from.\n\n\u201cThe radiocarbon dating we took came from a timber that was just about 15cm below where the water level was in May. So what that says to me is that sometime in the last 750 years the level had dropped to maybe as low as that point before, but no lower.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It might have happened much more recently, it\u2019s impossible to say.\u201d\n\nBut he said such low levels of water would have been extremely rare, otherwise the wood they tested simply wouldn\u2019t have survived.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s notable that the timber we sampled was birch, because birch isn\u2019t particularly robust \u2013 it doesn\u2019t hold-up well,\u201d he said. \u201cIf water levels had even got close to where they were in May, you would lose birch in that upper portion through wave action and the freezing and thawing of the water\u2019s surface.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere it was in May, it\u2019s not been significantly lower than that in the last 750 years.\u201d\n\nBut Dr Stratigos said exploring the reasons why the loch had lost so much water so quickly was \u201cfar beyond the remit of archaeology\u201d.\n\nLocals have previously blamed Scottish Water, suggesting boreholes have drained the aquifers supplying the loch, but this has been rejected by the company, which said their activities 3 miles upstream were too far away to affect it.\n\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Agency has suggested the loch had suffered due to a \u201crelatively dry\u201d winter, the BBC reports.\n\nThis came after a major summer heatwave last year during which caused widespread drought, hosepipe bans, crop failures, and a number of wildfires.\n\nThe prospect of similar heatwaves, which are becoming increasingly likely due to climate change has concerned archaeologists.\n\nThis month, public body Historic Environment Scotland, published a stark warning of how a changing climate could impact Scotland\u2019s heritage.\n\nTheir report said: \u201cMany changes to our climate are already happening and further changes are unavoidable. If we are to reduce their impact, adaptation is essential. For the historic environment in Scotland, this means addressing the physical impact of increased rainfall, more frequent extreme weather events, increasing temperatures, rising seas and shifting coasts. These changes, individually and collectively, are already having a damaging impact on our historic environment.\u201d\n\nDr Stratigos added: \u201cWetland archaeology, crannogs being prominent in Scotland among them, are very sensitive to climate change. As these types of extreme events become more common we are likely to see cultural heritage put at risk.\u201d", "description": "Water levels in a freshwater Scottish loch mysteriously reached a 750-year low earlier this year, according to archaeologists studying the remains of an ancient settlement on a man-made island.
