Nothing can distribute the yellow powder more efficiently\u2014something farmers that shell out for commercial beehives every growing season know all too well. And starting with this fall\u2019s growing season, bees may be given some cargo to carry on their outbound journey to the blossoms: pesticides.\n\nOn August 28, the EPA approved the first-ever bee-distributed organic pesticide for the US market\u2014a fungus-fighting powder called Vectorite that contains the spores of a naturally occurring fungus called Clonostachys rosea (CR-7). CR-7 is completely harmless to its host plant and acts as a hostile competitor to other, less innocuous fungi. It has been approved for commercial growers of flowering crops like blueberries, strawberries, almonds, and tomatoes.\n\nThe beauty of Vectorite is that it mimics a \u201clocally appropriate natural system,\u201d said Vicki Wojcik, director of Pollinator Partnership Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting twist\u2026 where care for the health of the pollinator is actually vital because it is your actual vector.\u201d\n\nHitching a ride\n\nFarmers around the world pollinate their crops with rented hives\u2014honeybees for fields and bumblebees for greenhouses. It\u2019s big business, too. California\u2019s almond farmers alone rent over a million commercial beehives to pollinate their trees every year.\n\nVectorite piggybacks on that system. Before bees buzz off to work, they trundle through a tray of powder placed by the hive exit. Then the bee just needs to do what it does best. Each time the bee lands on a flower, a little bit of the pesticide is knocked loose. Both bumblebees and honeybees are capable of spreading Vectorite up to 400 yards from their hive.\n\nOnce it\u2019s delivered by the bees, CR-7 quickly embeds itself within the plant, establishing a natural defense system against common fungal diseases including Botrytis cinereal (grey mold) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (white mold). If the spores of these or a number of other pathogens land on the plant, CR-7 blocks their development. Since bees are always on the lookout for newly blossomed flowers, they are more likely to deliver the fungicide earlier than traditional periodic spray methods, boosting its effectiveness.\n\nBee vectoring, as it\u2019s called, is a great option for organic farmers, but Ashish Malik hopes that more conventional farmers will adopt the technology as well. Malik, CEO of Vectorite manufacturer Bee Vectoring Technologies, said flowering crops like strawberries, sunflowers, and almonds are ideal candidates because bees are already a key part of their business model. If farmers do adopt the system, it would also be good news for native pollinators. Bee vectoring \u201chas virtually no environmental impact,\u201d said Roselyn Labb\u00e9, a greenhouse entomologist with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. The natural pesticides that the bees are capable of spreading without harm to themselves, she said, \u201care all over nature anyway.\u201d\n\nHigh efficiency\n\nBee vectoring could also save growers money in the long term due to its comparative efficiency, Labb\u00e9 said. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially delivering very small amounts in a very targeted way.\u201d In Canadian trials where bumblebees distributed an organic insecticide called Beauveria bassiana to greenhouse crops like tomatoes and strawberries, just 1.3% of the pesticide was needed relative to traditional methods. Bee Vectoring Technologies, meanwhile, claims that Vectorite with CR-7 requires just one teaspoon to every 4.5 pounds of traditionally sprayed pesticide to be effective. Bee-vectored pesticides have other benefits as well, including lower health risks for farmers.\n\nBut they won\u2019t replace spraying entirely. Bee vectoring \u201cwould not work for a late-season disease where there\u2019s no longer a flower, or a leaf disease or root disease,\u201d Malik said. The technology is also unlikely to be adopted by growers of crops like corn and soy that don\u2019t already use commercial beehives for pollination.\n\nWojcik and Labb\u00e9 said that bee vectoring is an exciting new tool that could work well with an old farming practice known as integrated pest management. Farmers using IPM implement low-impact measures on an as-needed basis, minimizing cost and negative effects on the environment and human health. \u201cThe theory of using biological control is nothing new,\u201d Wojcik said. \u201cIn the \u201860s and \u201870s, there was an enormous push to take this approach.\u201d\n\nFor farmers wanting to integrate bee vectoring into their own IPM strategy, the biggest barrier to adoption is the current lack of options. \u201cGrowers want to be able to choose from a number of different agents to be able to attack a different type of pest,\u201d Labb\u00e9 said, including insects or a broader range of fungal pests.\n\nSo far, only Canada, the EU, and now the US have a bee-vectored pesticide approved for commercial growers. And the pesticide approved in each country can only protect against a handful of potential threats. Canada\u2019s Beauveria bassiana, for instance, protects against insect pests like thrips and aphids but not fungal pathogens like gray mold. But Malik is hoping that Vectorite will soon be approved in other countries, and his company is researching additional fungal and bacterial spores that can work alongside CR-7, defending against a wider array of fungal pathogens as well as insect pests.\n\nTheir timing may be right. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in bee vectoring as a technology by growers,\u201d Labb\u00e9 said.", "description": "The EPA has approved the first-ever bee-distributed pesticide for the US market", "authors": ["Rachel Fritts"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RPBBonMonardaByKimMitchellUSFWS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
