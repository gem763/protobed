Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!\u201d\n\nTrump advised via Twitter that \u201cBrett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lies being told about him are unbelievable,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cFalse Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d\n\nTrump's tweets came after a New York Times article reported that Kavanaugh, whose confirmation to the Supreme Court incited fears that Roe v. Wade would be repealed, had allegedly exposed himself while inebriated to Deborah Ramirez when the two were in their freshman year at Yale University.\n\nPresident Trump (Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images); Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (Photo: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) More\n\nKavanaugh, according to the Times, \u201cpulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it.\u201d\n\nLast October, the Senate voted narrowly to confirm Kavanaugh to the nation\u2019s highest court, ending a bitterly divisive nomination fight that included allegations of misbehavior from multiple women, which he denied. During his confirmation hearing, one accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, testified that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her at a party when they were teenagers.\n\nAfter Ford\u2019s public accusation, an account of the alleged incident involving Ramirez first emerged last September during Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings. The allegations were dismissed by his supporters as uncorroborated, and although it was reported to the FBI during the confirmation process last year it was never investigated, according to the Times. Ramirez did not testify in the confirmation hearings, and Kavanaugh has denied both her and Ford\u2019s accusations.\n\n\u201cAt least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez\u2019s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nWhen asked last fall about Ramirez's allegations, Kavanaugh in a Fox News interview, said, \u201cI never did any such thing \u2014 never did any such thing. The other people alleged to be there don\u2019t recall any such thing. If such a thing had happened, it would\u2019ve been the talk of campus.\u201d\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, with lawyer Debra S.

One, Max Stier, told the Times said he saw Kavanaugh, \u201cwith his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nRamirez\u2019s legal team provided the FBI with \u201ca list of at least 25 individuals who may have had corroborating evidence,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cBut the bureau \u2014 in its supplemental background investigation \u2014 interviewed none of them, though we learned many of these potential witnesses tried in vain to reach the F.B.I. on their own.\u201d", "description": "President Trump defended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh against a new report of sexual misconduct and accused the media of trying to \u201cscare him into turning Liberal.\u201d", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T9Bh978R1R2xfltWQ8QuNg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/d19dcc20-d7db-11e9-b7e7-d7131214b09a", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
