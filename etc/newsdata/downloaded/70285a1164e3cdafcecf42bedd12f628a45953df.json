The former was a group of teens; the latter were elected members of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nWhile the U.N. Climate Action Summit took place in New York, 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists \u2014 including Jamie Margolin and this angel boy \u2014 were in Washington, D.C., urging Congress to take decisive climate action, and soon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to listen to me. I want you to listen to science, and then act.\u201d Thunberg said during her opening statement, according to CNN reporter Bill Weir, presenting the members of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee and the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis with a copy of the 2018 global warming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nIn turn, the members of Congress asked the activists salient questions like, \u201cWhy should we listen to the science?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not political opinion,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s science. Of course we should listen to it.\u201d\n\n.@GretaThunberg is asked \"Why should we listen to the science?\" and her befuddlement over such an obvious question is obvious.\n\n\"This is not political opinion,\" she says, touching the IPCC report. \"It's science. Of course we should listen to it.\" \u2014 Bill Weir (@BillWeirCNN) September 18, 2019\n\n\u201cIf you were picking up one piece of trash from the ocean while alongside, others were dumping boatloads of trash \u2026 how would that make you feel?\u201d asked one congressman \u2014 a gorgeous and childishly simplistic metaphor for the current climate crisis.\n\n\u201cI would stop dumping trash into the ocean and tell the other countries to stop dumping their trash, too,\u201d Thunberg replied.\n\nMargolin was more forceful, calling the suggestion that the U.S. shouldn\u2019t act on climate change first because other countries are also polluting \u201cshameful and cowardly.\u201d\n\nThe teens weren\u2019t letting lawmakers get away with empty flattery either. On Tuesday, Thunberg met with members of the Democratic leadership in Washington. \u201cWe need your leadership. Young people are the army,\u201d said Massachusetts senator Ed Markey, a co-author of the Green New Deal. \u201cYou put a spotlight on this issue in a way there has never been before.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease save your praise, we don\u2019t want it,\u201d said Thunberg. \u201cDon\u2019t invite us here to tell us how inspiring we are without doing anything about it. We don\u2019t want to be invited to these kinds of meetings because, honestly, they don\u2019t lead to anything.\u201d\n\nWhile the teen activists fought for their own future, outside the Capitol, the Amazon rainforest lay scorched, Bahamians tried to recover from the effects of Hurricane Dorian, ocean temperatures crept up toward a level that one U.N. report described as \u201cpoised to unleash misery,\u201d and coastal communities around the world wrestled with the existential question of whether they\u2019ll be around in 30 years, or even ten.\n\n\u201cTell them the truth,\u201d Thunberg said, when asked how to get more children engaged in fighting climate change. \u201cTell them how it is. When I found out, it made me furious \u2026 People in general don\u2019t seem to be very aware of how serious this crisis is.\u201d\n\nIt seems there are a lot of adults \u2014 ones in power \u2014 who need to be told how it is, too.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified one of the congressmen at the hearing.\n\nStay in touch.
