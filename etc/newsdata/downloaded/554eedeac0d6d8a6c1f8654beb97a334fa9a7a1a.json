For example, on text-based exams, he recommends judging how much to write based on the marks allocated for a question. \u201cIf you\u2019re writing a five-paragraph essay for a two-mark question, that\u2019s probably not the best idea.\u201d Or for the maths exam, be sure you know what programmes you can add to your calculator, he said, because sorting that out ahead of time \u201csimplifies a difficult problem into a far easier one\u201d.\n\nArthur said it\u2019s crucial to do as many past papers as you can. \u201cIt helps you remember things better, allows you to apply your knowledge, and de-stresses you in the actual exam.\u201d\n\nHis most important advice for humanities students is to remember to define key terms and contextualise answers. Science students, meanwhile, must be sure to organise and fully explain their answers while also linking together key ideas.\n\nLeading Lights: HK\u2019s IGCSE Spanish top scorer says the secret is to make the learning fun\n\nDon\u2019t forget the visual aids and your coursework\n\n\u2013 Kim Ji-Yeon, 16, West Island School\n\nJi-Yeon\u2019s secret to making revision easier is to present information visually. \u201cI found drawing diagrams in my notes useful,\u201d she said. Ji-Yeon also set rules for herself when doing past papers to get used to racing against the clock. For example, she would aim to get the first five questions done in 40 minutes, while tackling the last three questions within the last hour.\n\nWhile acing the exam is important, Ji-Yeon stressed you shouldn\u2019t overlook the weight your coursework carries. \u201cAvoid neglecting any coursework and take advantage of the fact that you can spend time to make it better,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if exams don\u2019t go very well, good coursework can drag your result up.\u201d\n\nLeading Lights: Latin is not a dead language for Hong Kong\u2019s top IGCSE scorer Nicole Chiu\n\nManage your time well and ask for help\n\n\u2013 Maggie Tam Hiu-ching, 15, PLK Choi Kai Yau School\n\nMaggie\u2019s recipe for getting the perfect score includes having good time management and resting up.\n\n\u201cMake sure you are on task. Manage your time well to finish your coursework and revision, but also get enough sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t work until late at night.\u201d\n\nWhen you encounter obstacles, don\u2019t forget to ask for help and read more on the subject, she added. \u201cRemember to aim higher and not be satisfied with just passing \u2026 It is for your own benefit. You are studying for yourself, not for anyone else!\u201d\n\nLeading Lights: Tips from top English literature A Level student on understanding Shakespeare, Bronte, Yeats and more\n\nSpread out your revision \u2013 don\u2019t cram it\n\n\u2013 Adrian Chan, 16, King George V School\n\nAdrian advised making your own notes, as well as doing regular revision and past papers. \u201cDon\u2019t leave revision until [the last minute], or else you\u2019ll be too stressed to do well,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Further Pure Mathematics gave him the worst headache, Adrian still managed to get a A*. The key, he said, is doing practice questions every week and asking your teacher for help when needed. \u201cGoing to tutors outside school is also useful, but you need to practise on your own as well.\u201d\n\nLeading Lights: IGCSE World Literature top scorer on how Harry Potter helped her excel academically, offer tips for aceing the papers\n\nBe interested in what you\u2019re learning\n\n\u2013 Michelle Lo Wai-man, 16, Yew Chung International School of Hong Kong\n\nDespite being tested on a chapter she didn\u2019t thoroughly revise, Michelle managed to gain an A* for her Biology exam. She attributed her success to having a \u201cgenuine interest\u201d in learning.\n\n\u201cTry to understand what you\u2019re learning instead of memorising the facts. [Rote learning] is not going to help you in the exams, where you\u2019re asked to apply your knowledge,\u201d she said.\n\nMichelle added that being well-rounded will help you \u201cin nearly every area\u201d, regardless of the exam subject. \u201cEven when you\u2019re answering a science paper, you have to present your answers clearly, and it involves your language skills,\u201d she explained.", "description": "Do regular revision, rest and manage your time well, say these students.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/91814a82-df5a-11e9-94c8-f27aa1da2f45imagehires155736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
