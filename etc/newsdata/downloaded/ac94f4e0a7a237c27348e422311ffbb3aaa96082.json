And that was our mission.\u201d\n\nDr. Smith\u2019s dedication to free markets is why the Surgery Center of Oklahoma has been a success, with patients including members of the Oklahoma City Thunder, University of Oklahoma Sooners and Oklahoma State Cowboys.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just athletes who go to the Surgery Center to get treatment. Dr. Smith has had patients from all across the United States and Canada fly into Oklahoma for treatment. He said it\u2019s because people know what they\u2019re getting.\n\n\u201cYou know with our facility, the reason that the prices are so comparatively low is that we\u2019re not trying to hit a grand slam on the facility charge,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Smith also pointed out the Surgery Center doesn\u2019t try to gouge patients on administrative costs because he\u2019d have to justify the charges. He sees his job as not just being a medical advocate for patients, but a financial advocate, too.\n\nDr. Smith\u2019s transparency has won praise from patients.\n\n\u201cDealing with them was the easiest thing in the world,\u201d patient Michelle Ray said. \u201cI called to verify that the price listed on the website was inclusive and accurate. I made an appointment and they told me everything I would need before, during, and after surgery.\u201d\n\nFree-market advocates call it a viable alternative to dealing with government and insurance companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny it\u2019s being called innovation. It\u2019s really not,\u201d Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs President Jonathan Small said. \u201cAll Dr. Smith wants is for the purchase of health care to operate like the purchase of anything else you need. For years, the struggle of patients was just trying to get a price for routine procedures. Dr. Smith and his partners were able to do that. Now you see that all over the country.\u201d\n\nThe practice has grown from two to about 40 doctors since it was founded. In its first year they saw about 1,000 patients. Dr. Smith said they have averaged about 7,000 a year since they began posting prices online in 2008.\n\nBut Dr. Smith\u2019s \u201ceverything old is new again\u201d concept was not an easy sell to the powers that be.\n\nDr. Smith said the state legislature attempted to get the Surgery Center of Oklahoma shut down in 2000.\n\nHe blames the Oklahoma Hospital Association for pushing legislation to require a tax on every physician or facility that did not generate 30 percent of their revenue from Medicaid, Medicare or charity care.\n\nThat would have forced Surgery Center of Oklahoma to accept government funds, something Dr. Smith wasn\u2019t going to let happen.\n\n\u201cWe had to work hard at the legislature to make sure to make that go away, and it backfired. We were attacked by our own health department,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe ended up winning that.\u201d\n\nThe legislature hasn\u2019t tried to go after Dr. Smith and his colleagues since, and even adopted a market-oriented policy last year that allows state employees to use their self-funded plans at cash-only facilities.\n\nNow Dr. Smith\u2019s ideas are spreading beyond Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2014 he helped launch the Free Market Medical Association, which hooks up patients with like-minded doctors. FMMA holds conferences to show doctors how to make a cash-only system work.\n\nDr. Smith said the movement has benefited from widespread disenchantment with the 2010 health care law. And he expects it to grow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about the practice of medicine in the United States than I\u2019ve ever been before,\u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cIn the federal government\u2019s attempt to take it over, it actually very paradoxically created a consumer market and it\u2019s going well. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nDr. Smith\u2019s efforts to re-instill a philosophy that goes back to his great uncle\u2019s work as a physician during the Great Depression \u2014 medical and financial accountability to patients \u2014 make him an Unsung Hero.", "description": "Part 5 of 8 in the series Unsung Heroes\r\n\r\nDr. Keith .09/02/2019 3:17:32AM EST.", "authors": ["Taylor Millard", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
