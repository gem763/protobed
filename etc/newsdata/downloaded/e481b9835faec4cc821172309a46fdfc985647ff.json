Survivors and rescuers will also face colder weather with northern Japan turning chilly this week.\n\nRescue efforts were in full force with soldiers and firefighters from throughout Japan deployed. Helicopters could be seen plucking some of the stranded from higher floors and rooftops of submerged homes.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would set up a special disaster team, including officials from various ministries, to deal with the fallout from the typhoon, including helping those in evacuation centres and boosting efforts to restore water and electricity to homes.\n\n\"Our response must be rapid and appropriate,\" Abe said, stressing that many people remained missing and damage was extensive.\n\nDamage was serious in Nagano prefecture, where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke. Areas in Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures in northern Japan were also badly flooded.\n\nIn such areas, rescue crew paddled in boats to each half-submerged home, calling out to anyone left stranded.\n\nTokyo Electric Power said 56,800 homes were still without electricity on Monday in Tokyo and nearby prefectures that the utility serves. Tohoku Electric Power said 5600 homes were without power in Miyagi, Iwate, Fukushima and Niigata.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEast Japan Railway said Hokuriku bullet trains were running on Monday but reduced in frequency and limited to the Nagano city and Tokyo route.\n\nAn image of the aerodynamically curved bullet trains sitting in water was seen by many as a sad but iconic symbol of the typhoon's devastation.\n\nMimori Domoto, who works at Nagano craft beer-maker Yoho Brewing, said all 40 employees at her company had been confirmed safe. But deliveries had temporarily halted, and an event to promote the beer in Tokyo over the weekend was cancelled for safety concerns.\n\n\"My heart aches when I think of the damage that happened in Nagano. Who would have thought it would get this bad?\" she said.\n\nTama River in Tokyo also overflowed, but damage was not as great as other areas. Areas surrounding Tokyo, such as Tochigi, also suffered damage.\n\nMuch of life in Tokyo returned to normal. People were out and about in the city, trains were running, and store shelves left bare when people were stockpiling were replenished.\n\nAAP", "description": "Rescue crews in Japan dug through mudslides and searched near swollen rivers as they looked for those missing from a typhoon that left as many as 36 dead and caused serious damage in central and northern Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_51/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/75a66102d5492084a4b35961dc18a29355b4366a", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
