If you\u2019re trying to go on a haunted one this Halloween, though, you might want to ask a different kind of expert. Enter Greg Newkirk, a paranormal investigator, travel writer and mythical-creature hunter.\n\nNewkirk and his wife, Dana Matthews-Newkirk, ran rival ghost-hunting websites as kids. They now work together on their media company, Planet Weird, which encompasses other projects like the Traveling Museum of the Paranormal & Occult and documentary Web series \u201cEngaging the Strange.\u201d\n\n\n\nA portrait of Greg Newkirk and Dana Matthews-Newkirk. (Karl Pfeiffer)\n\nThe couple\u2019s unique profession sends them traveling across the country, seeking out new paranormal destinations and experiences. One of their most important tips for those who want to follow in their footsteps and find spooky places has nothing to do with buying ghost-hunting gear or night-vision goggles.\n\n\u201cThe best piece of advice I can give to people who are looking for something that\u2019s off the radar is to ask the locals,\u201d Newkirk says. \u201cAnytime I show up in a town, the first thing I do is I go to either the local bar or the local diner and I just start asking questions. There\u2019s legends everywhere. They\u2019re in everyone\u2019s backyard. Anyone can find one, all they have to do is ask.\u201d\n\nFor those unconvinced about paranormal activity, Newkirk suggests supporting haunted destinations as a way to preserve history.\n\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s skeptical, it\u2019s totally reasonable. Being skeptical is important,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout folklore and ghost stories, we would lose very important histories and pieces of communities.\u201d\n\nHere are some of Newkirk\u2019s favorite off-the-beaten-path, \u201chaunted\u201d travel destinations worth visiting.\n\nFor the most bang for your haunted-vacation buck, visit Mackinac Island on Lake Huron. Mackinac was once home to the indigenous Odawa people until Jesuit priests, French fur traders and British soldiers came along.\n\n\u201cThe entire island is haunted,\u201d Newkirk says. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to be. It was sacred land to the indigenous people. You can walk the island and feel things everywhere.\"\n\nTo stay at Newkirk\u2019s recommended Mission Point Resort, you\u2019ll have to take a ferry to get to the carless island, where horse-drawn carriage is still a viable form of transportation. According to Newkirk, the hotel is frequented by a ghost named Harvey (whom he and his wife say they have met). Legend has it that Harvey took his life after being turned down by a woman he loved.\n\n\u201cHe still hangs out there,\u201d Newkirk says. \u201cYou can smell him. He has a very strong sense of body odor.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, the town of Point Pleasant, W.Va., was allegedly terrorized by a seven-foot-tall creature known as Mothman. It\u2019s been said the Mothman spawned from an abandoned TNT factory and went on to scare the living daylight out of couples in parked cars.\n\nCome to Point Pleasant for the Mothman lore, stay for the Lowe Hotel.\n\n\n\nThe Lowe Hotel in Point Pleasant, West Virginia (The Lowe Hotel)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stayed there numerous times in haunted rooms,\u201d Newkirk says. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced everything from faucets turning on and off, even someone saying one of our names waking us up in the morning when there was no one else on the floor except for our group.\u201d\n\nWhen booking at the Lowe, ask the reception to put you in one of its haunted accommodations for the scariest stay.\n\nGhost. Children. That\u2019s what drew the Newkirks to the Belvoir Winery and Inn. Formerly the Odd Fellows\u2019 Home complex (which included an orphanage, school, hospital and cemetery), the renovated Belvoir now hosts guests for much lighter activities like wine tastings, weddings and weekend getaways. But remnants of the past remain.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve maintained the place so well \u2014 you can see the grooves where the kids would walk single-file up to their rooms,\u201d Newkirk says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had really creepy experiences there. Lights turn on, doors open and close. The sound of kids laughing in the middle of the night outside your door.\u201d\n\nThe inn stocks notebooks in the rooms so guests can document the ghostly moments they experience and share them with future visitors. Newkirk recommends bringing kids\u2019 toys with you for your stay to prompt a spirit to manifest.\n\nNaturally, the oldest continuously operated inn in the United States has to be haunted. Longfellow\u2019s Wayside Inn has two rooms haunted by Jerusha Howe, the sister of a Longfellow\u2019s innkeeper who is said to have died of a broken heart. Prospective guests can request to stay in Rooms 9 and 10 to have the chance to experience her hauntings firsthand.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting is, so many people have had experiences with Jerusha at this inn that they\u2019ve started what\u2019s called the Secret Drawer Society,\u201d Newkirk says. \u201cIf you stay there, you\u2019ll start to notice that in all the nooks and crannies \u2014 like behind the headboard, in the drawers \u2014 there are notes from people who\u2019ve had ghostly experiences.\u201d\n\nIf you experience something yourself here, make sure to write it down and stick it in an available crack behind the floorboard or ceiling to add to the collection.\n\n[A local\u2019s guide to Boston]\n\nWikipedia will tell you that Atchison is aviator Amelia Earhart\u2019s hometown. What it won\u2019t tell you is that the place is allegedly haunted.\n\nThe small city in Kansas has gotten national attention for the Sallie House, a haunted former private residence that\u2019s been promoted on television shows, thanks to its ghost inhabitant Sallie, a girl who died in a botched appendicitis surgery. But that\u2019s not the only site that makes Atchison spooky.\n\n\u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize is, there\u2019s stuff like that all over this entire town,\u201d says Newkirk.\n\nNewkirk recommends staying at 1889 McInteer Villa.\n\n\n\n1889 McInteer Villa in Atchison, Kansas. (1889 McInteer Villa)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big mansion, haunted as all get-out,\u201d says Newkirk.\n\nWhen he stayed at the villa, \u201cthere was a straight-up knocking on walls. We were there with many other ghost hunters, and their equipment was going off like crazy.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the property particularly special is that people aren\u2019t sure where the activity comes from. There\u2019s no ghost story attached to the place. Visitors have the opportunity to take part in the ongoing investigation into who\u2019s haunting the mansion and why. Newkirk believes that eventually, as word gets out about the paranormal activity going on at the mansion, it will become just as popular as the Sallie House.\n\nThe swankiest haunted option Newkirk recommends is the Omni Mount Washington Resort, a luxury accommodation that has hosted the likes of Thomas Edison and multiple U.S. presidents. The Bretton Woods resort sports Spanish Renaissance architecture and the creepy presence of Carolyn Foster Stickney, Princess Aymon de Faucigny Lucinge, the widow of Mount Washington\u2019s original owner, who later remarried to a French nobleman.\n\n\n\nMount Washington Hotel, New Hampshire. (Omni Hotels & Resorts)\n\n\u201cThey say that she still is there and she watches over the place,\u201d says Newkirk. \u201cLots of people have seen her. Lots of people have experienced her presence.\u201d\n\nAnother draw to the property is that it sits on a large patch of land that cryptozoologists believe is where Bigfoot hides.\n\n\u201cYou can experience the haunting inside, and then, if you want, you do a little Bigfoot hunting in the woods later,\u201d says Newkirk.\n\nIf you don\u2019t experience the princess\u2019s presence, you might have a shot at seeing a bear enjoying the New Hampshire sunrise from the resort deck.\n\nTake a trip outside Cincinnati to Loveland, where you\u2019ll find a castle in the middle of the suburbs. The tourist attraction has interesting architecture, a collection of period weaponry and, according to its website, ghosts.\n\n\u201cThey say that it\u2019s haunted by the man who built it,\u201d says Newkirk of the Loveland Castle & Museum. \u201cHe had such a strong connection to the place, he never left.\u201d\n\nAlthough the castle is closed for overnight guests during the winter, you can stay there the rest of the year.\n\nNear the castle, you can hunt for the Loveland frog, a four-foot-tall creature allegedly spotted in the area in the \u201950s. According to Newkirk, the creature has been said to smell like almonds and carry a wand.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of traveling during the fall\n\nTell us what you think of By The Way\n\nFollow By The Way on Instagram for city highlights, travel tips and more\n\nA local\u2019s guide to Washington, D.C.", "description": "You want to go somewhere haunted, but you don't want to go where everyone else goes.
