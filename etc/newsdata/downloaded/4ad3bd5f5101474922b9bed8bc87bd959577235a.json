Gone for 30 years.\u201d\n\nFour days later, almost to the day Ting Ting went missing three decades ago, she saw her parents in a tearful reunion in front of the whole village.\n\n\u201cShe told us she had a good life and that her foster parents treated her well,\u201d Guosheng said.\n\nThe couple plan to accompany Ting Ting back to her hometown to meet her family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll properly thank her foster parents and grandparents for taking such good care of our daughter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Ting Ting\u2019s kidnapper \u2013 and all those involved in her trafficking \u2013 will ever be brought to justice.\n\nSource: Magazine Features", "description": "A woman who was kidnapped as a toddler has been reunited with her long-lost parents almost 30 years to the day after she went missing in the \u201980s.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9269/f1b5f63544f14986a91ef66a51d91e25.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
