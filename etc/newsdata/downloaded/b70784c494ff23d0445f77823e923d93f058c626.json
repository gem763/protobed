Former super-middleweight world champion George Groves provides expert analysis.

If there was ever a time to take his foot off the pedal it would have been then.\n\n\"I spoke to Eddie Hearn about potential opponents and David Price\u2019s name kept coming up. He\u2019s on a winning streak and he looked great against Dave Allen.\n\n\"It was an obvious fight; he brings a lot of danger, he\u2019s 6 foot 9 and I've sparred with him many times.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I believed at one stage he could be heavyweight champion of the world. It didn't work out that way but he\u2019s got a second wave of his career and looked as good as ever in his last fight.\"\n\nChisora is the odds-on favourite to beat Price with bookies Betfair and while Haye predicts a potentially rocky start, he expects his man to come through.\n\n\"Dereck has sparred with David before so he's felt his power,\" he added. \"It's hard to get past that long jab; he has a piston like jab.\n\n\"They don't look hard on TV but I've eaten a few of them. Hes a heavy-handed man and to beat him you've got to come through a few problems.\n\n\"Dereck knows he might have to weather an early storm to keep the educated pressure on and grind him down.\n\n\"It's going to be very, very explosive early but I see Dereck's physicality being the key to smothering David Price.\"", "description": "Chisora will instead take on David Price after Parker was forced to pull out after being bitten by a spider", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20684936.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Regis-Prograis-Josh-Taylor-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
