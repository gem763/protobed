Their directive to designers Jamie Drake and Caleb Anderson: Give us \u201csome sizzle factor, some shine, some glitter.\u201d\n\nThe existing beams and soffits created some design challenges that were overcome with architectural elements, such as the silver-leaf ceiling panel over the dining table and a metal-and-glass screen off the entryway. These aim to soften the structural supports.\n\nThe apartment makeover took about a year, and it cost over $400,000 to furnish the open-plan living and dining room with new decor throughout, Mr. Drake says. The result is \u201ccomfortable, livable, yet glamorous,\u201d says Mr. Drake, of New York design firm Drake/Anderson. Below are some elements of the living-dining room, with prices.\n\n1. The 85-inch sofa provides ample seating for guests and faces the TV (not shown). Prices: Minotti Suitcase 216 sofa from the Domus Design Collection, $9,045; upholstery fabric is Dippiopanama by Dedar, $3,816\n\n2. The custom coffee table has a subtle metallic finish ideal for displaying two sculptural vases. Prices: Coffee table by Future Perfect, $24,503; porcelain vases by Sandra Davolio at $26,000 for the pair\n\n3. The leather poufs provide informal seating and complement the blues found elsewhere in the space. Prices: Poufs made by Montaigne Studio, $3,675 for two, and upholstered with Foglizzo leather, $2,499\n\n4. The seating area is grounded with an Edward Fields area rug, also with blue hues. Price: $33,750\n\n5. Natural lighting can be adjusted with the motorized roman shades. Prices: Motorized roman shades by Jouffre, $28,029, with fabric by Pietro Seminelli in chalk, $4,356\n\n6. The couple frequently host sit-down dinner parties at a table that can accommodate 12. The space is lighted with a modern crystal chandelier mounted to a curved, silver-leaf ceiling with side lighting. Prices: Dining table, $19,886, and Febo chairs, $19,651, covered in Pierre Frey Balgo fabric in celeste, $4,234, are from B&B Italia; chandelier by Atelier Courbet, $49,463; silver-leaf ceiling treatment by the Alpha Workshops, $21,540\n\n7. A metal panel creates a divide between the dining room and the entryway. Prices: Framework by Armadillo Metalworks, $50,267, and glass from SEI Studio, $17,763\n\n8. A sculptural Lathe V Red Art Chair by Sebastian Brajkovic is made of bronze and placed as a statement piece rather than seating. Price: $58,000\n\n9.Objets d\u2019art, such as the candlesticks on the dining table and a Jeff Zimmerman sculpture adjacent to it, are added for touches of glamour. Prices: Candlesticks from Phoenix Gallery, $8,900 for set of five; Jeff Zimmerman glass sculpture, $25,000.\n\nWrite to Beth DeCarbo at beth.decarbo@wsj.com", "description": "A pair of empty nesters tapped designers Jamie Drake and Caleb Anderson to create a \u2018comfortable, livable, yet glamorous\u2019 apartment in uptown Manhattan.", "authors": ["Beth Decarbo"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105802/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
