(AP) - Carl and Kerri Schwartz say they have good medical reason for not vaccinating their disabled 11-year-old son, Thorn, and until recently his local public school went along with their family doctor\u2019s advice.\n\nThat changed, the Schwartzes said, when New York state did away with religious exemptions for vaccines in the middle of a measles outbreak, and then clamped down on medical exemptions like theirs. Thorn is now barred from his school in Fairport while his parents challenge the district\u2019s rejection of his exemption.\n\nThorn Schwartz has autism, a developmental disorder that affects each child differently, and his father said a new state policy is leaving little room for exceptions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so specific for that patient. If that doctor can\u2019t tie a particular vaccination to this particular child\u2019s body, it\u2019s just denied. Period,\u201d Carl Schwartz said.\n\nAmid a flurry of proposals to end personal-belief exemptions for vaccines in states around the country, families like the Schwartzes and others say the restrictions that passed in New York have led to unbending scrutiny and, in some cases, decisions that overrule the guidance of family doctors and force children into home-schooling.\n\nNew York this year became the fifth state to require all students except those with valid medical reasons to be fully vaccinated, when lawmakers eliminated exemptions on religious grounds.\n\nThe state followed up with emergency regulations toughening requirements for medical exemptions. State officials said they did not want a repeat of what happened in California, where medical exemptions more than tripled in the three years after they became the only allowable reason for a student to be unvaccinated. California lawmakers\u2019 efforts to rein in the numbers by giving the state greater oversight sparked expansive protests during the recent legislative session.\n\nAnother New York child who had his medical exemption rejected, Ameer Hamideh, 9, uses a wheelchair and assisted communication device because of cerebral palsy and a seizure disorder. He was in and out of the hospital for seizures after his last round of immunizations as a toddler.\n\nThe child\u2019s neurologist, Dr. Sarah Finnegan, completed a state-required form for the Frontier Central School District recommending against additional shots because of a history of \u201cseizure activity triggered by these immunizations.\u201d But the district instead followed the advice of a state Health Department official who recommended against the exemption.\n\n\u201cThe doctor who\u2019s been in his life for nine years versus a lady in Albany that doesn\u2019t know who he is, has never met him, just read something and said, \u2018nope, we\u2019re not accepting it,\u2019\u201d Ameer\u2019s father, Ali, said.\n\nAmeer, who is now homeschooled, has been without the physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and special education classroom placement included in his education plan.\n\n\u201cI can only do so much with him,\u201d said Orooba Hamideh, his mother. \u201cI\u2019m not a licensed therapist. I do basic things with him, like play, but as far as therapy, I\u2019m not equipped to do PT or OT or speech.\u201d\n\nFrontier Superintendent Richard Hughes declined to discuss Ameer\u2019s case, noting only that \u201cschool districts often seek a review and recommendation from the professionals at the New York State Department of Health, and then consider that recommendation when making determinations.\u201d\n\nHundreds of New York children affected by the change are in similar situations, according to Rita Palma, who co-founded the New York chapter of the Children\u2019s Health Defense. The organization unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the Legislature\u2019s repeal of the religious exemption.\n\nData on the number of medical exemptions granted and rejected in the current school year won\u2019t be available until next year, after mandatory district surveys are compiled, state health officials said. In 2017-18, 4,571 students in New York, .14%, were medically exempt from vaccines, according to the state Health Department.\n\nThe other states that allow only medical exemptions in addition to New York and California are West Virginia, Mississippi and Maine. The rest all have religious or philosophical exemptions. Maine in May removed non-medical exemptions after an outbreak of whooping cough and amid rising vaccine opt-out rates, but won\u2019t implement the change until September 2021.\n\nMississippi also requires a form be completed by a licensed physician. It\u2019s then reviewed by a state health official. West Virginia has never accepted anything but a medical exemption subject to approval by the state immunization officer.\n\nSeveral other states have seen legislative proposals to eliminate personal-belief exemptions because of concerns about disease outbreaks, but they often have failed amid backlashes.\n\nAfter New York eliminated the religious exemptions that allowed more than 26,000 students to attend school unvaccinated, it began requiring doctors to submit a signed form to districts specifying which vaccines a student should skip, for how long and documenting how the vaccine would hurt the child. Before, doctors weren\u2019t required to detail on an approved form why an immunization would be detrimental to the child\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cOur interest in doing so is to prevent abuse of the process and ensure only those who have legitimate medical reasons for not getting vaccinated are still able to obtain medical exemptions,\u201d Health Department spokeswoman Jill Montag said by email. The district has the final say, she said.\n\nIn Thorn\u2019s case, the family doctor is very much pro-vaccine but recommended against additional shots for Thorn, Carl Schwartz said.\n\n\u201cOur son is so frail, his brain is so fragile and so unable to recover from anything that goes through it,\u201d he said.\n\nMark Frenzel, principal of Thorn\u2019s school in the Monroe One BOCES district, wrote that the district physician had determined Thorn\u2019s case is \u201cnot consistent with guidance\u201d for allowing medical exemptions issued by the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carl and Kerri Schwartz say they have good medical reason for not vaccinating their disabled 11-year-old son, Thorn, and until recently his local public school went along with their family doctor's advice.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Carolyn Thompson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/vaccines_medical_exemptions_33659_c0-240-5760-3600_s1200x700.jpg?3b9a8ea0e82656f098dd6f7cd5420c99f93f2f69", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
