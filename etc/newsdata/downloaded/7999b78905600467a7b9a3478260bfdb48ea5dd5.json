A fond farewell. Sudden loss. Unfulfilled potential. Little children doomed before they\u2019ve properly started. The tragedy that someone somewhere takes their own life every 40 seconds.\n\nSo it is always inspiring to meet people determined to do something about it.\n\nUnited for Global Mental Health are a coalition of activists from dozens of countries who have had enough. They\u2019ve had enough of watching this public-health crisis deepen \u2013 on our streets, in our prisons, in our hospitals, in our schools \u2013 while governments faff.\n\n\u201cWe find, unite and amplify,\u201d chief executive Elisha London told me. This week, to coincide with world mental health day, they opened something rather remarkable: The Museum of Lost and Found Potential, an exhibition of items from people with mental health issues. If you are in London, do check it out \u2013 it\u2019s essential and moving. Sad, but good.\n\nOtherwise, here is our top picks of the week.\n\n\u2022 The Iraqis translating the internet into Arabic. 90-second read\n\n\u2022 Can chewing gum tell you when you\u2019re more likely to conceive? One-minute chew\n\n\u2022 The rise and rise of Bangladesh. Forty-year miracle\n\n\u2022 British Airways to make up for its mess. Two-minute read\n\n\u2022 The refugee camp girls who kicked back against a football ban Three-minute read\n\n\u2022 Bold plan to \u2018laser map\u2019 the Earth Three-minute read\n\nYou can also catch up with all this week\u2019s Nobel prize winners:\n\n\u2022 chemistry: the lithium-ion men\n\n\u2022 physics: a cosmological trio\n\n\u2022 medicine: the hypoxia troika\n\n\u2022 literature: not one, but two this year\n\n\u2022 peace: see below\n\nLucky numbers\n\nClimate change is terrifying \u2013 but occasionally it delivers a windfall. The Indian monsoon was the wettest for 25 years, with 10% more rain than average. Rice and wheat farmers may be set for a bumper year, Reuters reports.\n\nIn other data news, your Upside editor turned 50.\n\nWhat we liked\n\nA new site that feels like the Upside\u2019s artistic cousin, visualising positive trends in a series of beautiful graphics \u2013 one a day for the next year.\n\nWe also liked this piece in the Conversation on why/how climate change coverage needs to move on from scare stories to tales of inspiration and empowerment.\n\nAnd finally, we salute this year\u2019s \u00a320,000 Wellcome photography prize, which among other things solicits images to dispel visual cliches of mental illness.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest What does depression look like? Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\n\nWhat we heard\n\nLinda Offord responded to our article last week about taking the plastic out of women\u2019s sanitary products:\n\nI think a major problem relates to the plastic in nappies which end up incinerated or put in landfill. If plastic can be removed from menstruation products what about nappies and incontinence pads?\n\nBecky Burchell is the founder of a new arts festival that launches next week in central England:\n\nMuch of our current popular culture \u2013 TV, movies, news, theatre \u2013 paints a picture of a bleak, dystopian future where humanity is tearing itself apart, leading to increased eco-anxiety, negativity and paralysis. It\u2019s time to tell different stories \u2013 ones that stretch our dreams and inspires courage and hope.\n\nFollowing on from our work on kindness, John Keenan got in touch:\n\nThis year\u2019s Kindness UK Doctoral Conference Award for the University of Sussex will be launched on World Kindness Day, 13 November. A lunchtime panel discussion at the university\u2019s Attenborough Centre will feature Kind Rebellion, a combination of music, animation, and academic debate. The event will include a performance by New Note Orchestra which comprises musicians in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction.\n\nWhere was the Upside?\n\nIn Ethiopia, celebrating its first Nobel winner, after the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, was awarded the 2019 peace prize.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peacemaker: Abiy, centre, with his erstwhile rival Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki, last year Photograph: Mulugeta Ayene/AP\n\nThanks for reading.
