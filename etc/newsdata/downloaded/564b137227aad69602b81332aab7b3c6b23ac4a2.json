That could soon change to a 50-50 pricing mix, Birol added.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "In the next five years, about one-third of global LNG demand will come from China alone", "authors": ["Jessica Jaganathan"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/lng-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
