Other courses are taught at specifically religious colleges, or are meant for engaged couples, like Pre-Cana, a marriage prep course required of all couples desiring to marry in a Catholic church.\n\nNorthwestern\u2019s Marriage 101 is unique among liberal arts universities in offering a course that is comprehensively and directly focused on the experiential, on self-exploration: on walking students through the actual practice of learning to love well.\n\nWhile popular culture often depicts love as a matter of luck and meeting the right person, after which everything effortlessly falls into place, learning how to love another person well, Solomon explains, is anything but intuitive. Among the larger lessons students learn in this class are:\n\nSelf-understanding is the first step to having a good relationship\n\n\u201cThe foundation of our course is based on correcting a misconception: that to make a marriage work, you have to find the right person. The fact is, you have to be the right person,\u201d Solomon declares. \u201cOur message is countercultural: Our focus is on whether you are the right person. Given that we\u2019re dealing with 19-, 20-, 21-year olds, we think the best thing to do at this stage in the game, rather than look for the right partner, is do the work they need to understand who they are, where they are, where they came from, so they can then invite in a compatible suitable partner.\u201d\n\nTo that end, students keep a journal, interview friends about their own weaknesses, and discuss what triggers their own reactions and behaviors in order to understand their own issues, hot buttons, and values. \u201cBeing blind to these causes people to experience problems as due to someone else\u2014not to themselves,\u201d Solomon explains. \u201cWe all have triggers, blind spots, growing edges, vulnerabilities. The best thing we can do is be aware of them, take responsibility for them, and learn how to work with them effectively.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t avoid marital conflict, but you can learn how to handle it better\n\nThe instructors teach that self-discovery is impossible without knowing where you came from. \u201cUnderstanding your past and the family you grew up in helps you to understand who you are now and what you value,\u201d Solomon says. To help students recognize what has shaped their views on love, she and her colleagues have students extensively interview their own parents about their own relationship. Many find this to be the most demanding and yet the most rewarding assignment of the course. Maddy Bloch, who took the course two years ago along with her boyfriend at the time, learned a lot when she interviewed her own parents about their own marriage, despite the fact that they are divorced. \u201cI learned that in an intimate relationship each person holds a tremendous amount of power that you can easily turn on someone,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is why relationships require a lot of mutual trust and vulnerability.\u201d", "description": "A course at Northwestern University teaches students about what makes a healthy relationship.", "authors": ["Christine Gross-Loh"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/239868138_e8005a2e88_b-1/facebook.jpg?1522696150"}
