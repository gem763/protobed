The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.'\n\nBoris Johnson's hopes of a Brexit deal at today's EU summit were in tatters after the DUP branded the package unacceptable\n\nMr Corbyn also distanced himself from such a move last weekend, telling Sky News:'I think many in Parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be inclined to support it, because they don't really agree with the deal \u2013 but I would caution them on this.'\n\nThe Labour leader has said that he wants a general election before any potential referendum vote.\n\nBut a Lib Dem source said it wanted a People's Vote before an election.\n\n'We have been aware that Labour Whips have been in discussions with their own MPs about this sequence.\n\n'In the scenario a deal happens, we would want Corbyn to back a People's Vote too.\n\n'It has to be a three-line whip as when it was indicative votes too many Labour MPs ignored Corbyn and we lost the vote for that reason.'\n\nTory chairman James Cleverly said: 'All Jeremy Corbyn offers is more dither and pointless delay.\n\n'Jeremy Corbyn has spent three years trying to frustrate Brexit, undermined negotiations with his Surrender Act, and twice refused to support a general election.\n\n'He doesn't trust the people, and he is simply not willing or able to make the difficult decisions needed to take Britain forward.'\n\nbrexit countdown_bg Created with Sketch.\n\nThe UK and the EU have agreed to a new Brexit deal as Boris Johnson said he will ask MPs to vote for it on Saturday despite continued DUP opposition.\n\nMr Johnson and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker both announced the bombshell breakthrough this morning.\n\nHowever, the DUP has rejected the proposed agreement which means it is far from certain that it will be agreed by a majority of MPs when Parliament sits at the weekend.\n\nMr Johnson tweeted: 'We've got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.'\n\nMr Juncker added: 'Where there is a will, there is a deal - we have one!\n\n'It's a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that #EUCO endorses this deal.'\n\nThe DUP issued a statement early this morning in which the party branded the package put forward by the PM unacceptable.\n\nThe party said it 'cannot support' the concessions made on customs and consent of the Northern Irish people.\n\nDealing another hammer blow to the fledgling blueprint, they also condemned a 'lack of clarity' on whether EU VAT rates will apply in the province.\n\nThe DUP statement was issued before Mr Johnson announced that a deal had been done with the EU.\n\nBut the party then reportedly refused to budge in the wake of the news as sources told Sky News: 'Read our statement. It has not changed.'\n\nMr Johnson's decision to push ahead with the deal despite not having the support of the DUP sets up a tense showdown vote in the House of Commons on 'Super Saturday'.", "description": "The Labour leader is said to be planning to whip his MPs to back an expected amendment making the agreement hammered out by the Prime Minister and his team today subject to a public vote.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/10/19829010-0-image-a-5_1571304362631.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
