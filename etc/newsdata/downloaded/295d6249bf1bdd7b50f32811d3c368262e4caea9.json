It was Trump who, despite a vociferous backlash in Washington, started to echo Turkish talking points about the SDF being \u201ccommunists\u201d and \u201cterrorists.\u201d And it was Trump who on Thursday hailed a \u201cdeal\u201d clinched with Turkey that effectively satisfied most of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s demands while also relieving him of the looming threat of U.S. sanctions on his country\u2019s vulnerable economy.\n\nAD\n\nAfter hours of meetings at Erdogan\u2019s presidential palace, Vice President Pence announced that Turkey had agreed to pause its offensive for five days, during which the United States would help facilitate the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from a belt of territory along the Syrian-Turkish border. There was no indication of when, or even if, Turkey would withdraw from a vast designated \u201csafe zone\u201d spanning the Turkish border that extends some 20 miles into Syria.\n\nGreat news out of Turkey. News Conference shortly with @VP and @SecPompeo. Thank you to @RTErdogan. Millions of lives will be saved! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019\n\nMr. President, many more lives will be saved when we defeat terrorism, which is humanity's arch enemy. I am confident that this joint effort will promote peace and stability in our region. \u2014 Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan (@RTErdogan) October 17, 2019\n\nAs my colleagues reported, the Trump administration had also agreed not to impose any new economic sanctions on Turkey, and to withdraw sanctions that were imposed earlier this week once \u201ca permanent cease-fire was in effect,\u201d Pence said.\n\nAD\n\nBy Thursday night, it was far from clear what sort of cease-fire had come into effect. Turkish officials refused to even use the term. They view the main force within the SDF \u2014 a Syrian Kurdish group known as the YPG \u2014 as a direct extension of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a banned terrorist organization that\u2019s fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. In the joint communique that followed Pence and Erdogan\u2019s meeting, both sides committed to the YPG\u2019s withdrawal from territory along the Turkish border. (Neither Pence nor Trump made any acknowledgment Thursday of the more than 11,000 Kurdish fighters who died on the front lines of the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State.)\n\nAD\n\nThough SDF officials agreed to a cessation of hostilities around certain flash points, they didn\u2019t confirm plans to withdraw fully from positions along the border. And the arrival of the Syrian regime and allied Russian forces to northeastern Syria \u2014 another consequence of Trump\u2019s maneuvering this week \u2014 further complicates the picture.\n\nThe new understanding between Turkey and the United States is \u201ca big gift [to Turkey] if the agreement sticks,\u201d Gonul Tol, director of Turkish studies at the Middle East Institute think tank, told Today\u2019s WorldView. \u201cIt is everything Erdogan asked for \u2014 a 20-mile-deep zone, off limits to the YPG, and sanctions will be lifted if the cease-fire holds. The problem is, there are Russian and regime forces in that area, which makes the implementation of the deal difficult.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nErdogan is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin early next week in talks that may highlight the extent to which Syria\u2019s political future is controlled by policymakers in Ankara and Moscow.\n\nAD\n\nTrump justified his decision to cut and run from northeastern Syria as a fulfillment of his desire to disentangle the United States from a thicket of conflicts in the Middle East. But removing what was still a relatively tiny footprint \u2014 especially compared to American deployments elsewhere in the region, which Trump has not touched \u2014 triggered a far larger geopolitical earthquake. The Assad regime recovered more territory in a few days than it had in many months. And social media footage of Russian soldiers and journalists gloating amid abandoned U.S. military camps told their own story.\n\nIn Washington, there were more howls of disapproval. \u201cThe cease-fire does not change the fact that America has abandoned an ally, adding insult to dishonor,\u201d said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), speaking in defense of the SDF on the floor of the Senate. \u201cThe administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty. Their homes have been burned and their families have been torn apart.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump, though, won\u2019t pay much heed. He has chosen to prioritize mending fences with Erdogan\u2019s Turkey \u2014 a b\u00eate noire for many lawmakers on the Hill \u2014 over safeguarding the autonomy of the communities backed by the SDF. Officials close to the Trump administration speak also of a close personal bond between Trump and the Turkish leader \u2014 in keeping with his affinity with other strongmen around the world.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWith Erdogan, Trump seems to have found a soul mate,\u201d my colleagues reported this week. \u201cNot only does he consider the Turkish leader \u2018a tough guy who deserves respect\u2019 and \u2018a friend,\u2019 according to another former senior official, Erdogan has now provided Trump with a way to at least partially achieve his campaign promise to remove U.S. forces from the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe feeling may be somewhat mutual. Even an absurdly worded letter Trump sent Erdogan last week \u2014 telling his Turkish counterpart not to \u201cbe a fool\u201d or a \u201ctough guy\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t disrupt the rapprochement underway.\n\nAD\n\nEXCLUSIVE: I have obtained a copy of \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069\u2019s letter to #Erdogan. \u2066@POTUS\u2069 warns him to not \u201cbe a tough guy! Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d Says he could destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if #Syria is not resolved in a humane way.

The official argued that America\u2019s continued alliance with the SDF was untenable and only \u201cpushed Russia, Iran and Turkey closer together,\u201d undermining longer term U.S. interests. Unlike many politicians in Washington, the official claimed, Trump understood the deeper challenge.\n\nAD\n\nEven as analysts panned his seeming capitulation to Ankara, Trump was exultant. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the United States, it\u2019s a great day for Turkey,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday in Texas. \u201cA great day for the Kurds, it\u2019s a great day for civilization, a great day for civilization.\u201d\n\nBut at what cost? According to U.N. and human rights monitors, about 300,000 people have been forced from their homes and at least 71 people have been killed since Turkey launched its operation into northeastern Syria.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
