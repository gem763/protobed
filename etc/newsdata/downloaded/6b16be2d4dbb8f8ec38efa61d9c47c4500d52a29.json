That\u2019s as Wall Street eyes a perkier start, with Dow YM00, +0.42%, S&P 500 ES00, +0.35% and Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00, +0.21% in the green.\n\nInvestors are juggling lots of worries \u2014 trade tussles, recession threats, both for the economy and earnings, as well a looming U.S. presidential election. And then there\u2019s the chance it will all turn out A-OK.\n\nOur call of the day, from John Linehan, portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price\u2019s Equity Income Fund, says if investors want some protection from all that could go right or wrong, they need to balance their investment strategies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think now\u2019s the time you want to aggressively tilt your portfolio, either to prepare yourself for an economic downturn, or to prepare yourself for the economy to go gangbusters,\u201d Linehan told MarketWatch in a recent telephone interview.\n\nInvestors need to be \u201copportunists\u201d \u2014 pick stocks that offer upside opportunity if the economy avoids a downturn, but some downside protection if it doesn\u2019t, he says. With that, he offers up three stock ideas, starting with Wells Fargo WFC, +0.12%.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is find a significant asymmetry where there\u2019s a lot more upside than downside and Wells [Fargo] would be an example of that,\u201d he said. The bank, which also reports Tuesday, has a strong balance sheet with excess capital that can be used for shareholder buybacks and trades at a discount to regional banks.\n\nNext is France\u2019s Total TOT, -0.67% FP, +0.87%. Among the big energy companies in this space, Linehan says it has one of the best balance sheets and management teams, and least demanding valuation.\n\nFox Corp. FOXA, -0.22%, owner of Fox News and Fox Sports channels, is his third pick. While the media group has some exposure to the economy, it would probably weather any storm, he says. (Note: Fox Corp. and MarketWatch parent News Corp. NWS, +0.29% share common ownership.)\n\n\u201cTheir strengths are partisan news and sports, and right now that\u2019s where the viewership is, and that\u2019s where the engaged viewership is,\u201d which would mean it can compete with Disney DIS, -0.25%, he said, adding that the company is also a \u201ccash flow machine.\u201d\n\nThe chart\n\nAn unresolved U.S-China trade dispute is the \u201cnew normal,\u201d says 43% of investors surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s latest monthly fund manager survey. And that\u2019s our chart of the day:\n\nThe buzz\n\nEarnings from banks are in focus (see preview), with Goldman GS, +0.56%, Citi C, +0.20%, JPMorgan JPM, +0.27%, and Wells Fargo rolling out results. UnitedHealth UNH, -0.67% and while Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.46% are still to come.\n\nRead: 5 big U.S. companies most to blame for the earnings recession\n\nDovish St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard makes case for more rate cuts.\n\nRead: Harley-Davidson has stopped producing electric motorcycles\n\nSocial media app TikTok has reportedly moved into Facebook\u2019s FB, -0.49% backyard, by poaching some of its workers.
