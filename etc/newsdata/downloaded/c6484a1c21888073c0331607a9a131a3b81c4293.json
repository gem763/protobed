(iStock)\n\nQ: I enjoyed Ilyce\u2019s radio show for many years when she was on the air in Atlanta. I\u2019ve also signed up for Ilyce\u2019s informative newsletters.\n\nUnfortunately, my sister is the one who really needs help. She is, and has always been, a financial disaster. Her ex doesn\u2019t pay her child support, although he\u2019s supposed to. She has three kids, one who is in college, one on the way to college and the other going in a couple of years.\n\nThe IRS has a lien on her house, which is falling apart, and her homeowner\u2019s association is suing her because of the home\u2019s appearance. She\u2019s trying to settle her debts with the IRS, and a couple of years ago, I helped her pay off her credit card debts. Shortly after that, she had maxed out the cards again. She pays over 20 percent interest on those credit cards. I\u2019ve told her to get help from a credit counseling service.\n\nOur parents have also helped her out over the years, but none of us know what to do. What advice do you have for her or for me to get her on the right path before she ends up homeless?\n\nA: It's truly hard to help family members who don't have a good handle on their finances and seem confused by the basics: Spend less than you make, bank the rest.\n\n[More Matters: Rodent problems in your condo building? Your condo association should take action.]\n\nPart of the problem is that people don\u2019t know what they spend. So they spend too much given how much they earn. In a recent CareerBuilder survey, some 78 percent of Americans reported living paycheck to paycheck. That\u2019s terrifying, given that around 40 percent of Americans don\u2019t just have one job, they also have a \u201cside hustle\u201d or second job to make ends meet.\n\nClearly, that\u2019s not working so well. And spending more than you make is a recipe for disaster \u2014 as is having friends and family members who are willing to bail you out, over and over again.\n\nWhich brings us back to your sister. You've helped her clear some (maybe all?) of her debts. But she immediately started charging up her credit cards again. Your parents have helped, too. More than once? Probably.\n\nIs she going to change? Probably not. Your sister seems to be the type of person who knows she doesn\u2019t have to: Someone will be there to catch her before she hits rock bottom. For whatever reason, perhaps because she truly doesn\u2019t earn enough (without financial help from her ex-spouse) to keep the wheels on her financial bus, her financial life doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n[More Matters: Reading the tea leaves in the real estate market]\n\nIf you\u2019re determined to help, your sister\u2019s IRS debt isn\u2019t the most immediate issue she\u2019s facing with her home. The IRS has unlimited patience and will wait out a sale. However, if she is falling behind in her mortgage payments, her real estate taxes or her homeowners assessment, she could be in imminent danger of losing her home.\n\nSo consider buying the home from her. If you and your parents have the financial wherewithal, you could buy the home, bring the taxes to current, get someone to settle with the homeowners association and negotiate with the IRS.\n\nThen, sit down with her and walk through her finances. A not-for-profit credit counseling service (find one at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, NFCC.org) is a great idea, but she may need your steady hand to help organize her enough for an effective counseling session.\n\nAt the end of the day, she has to want (and welcome) your help, not just your money. And if she doesn't, please reach out to her children and offer them some money lessons so their financial lives are more in control.\n\nIlyce Glink is the author of \u201c100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask\u201d (4th Edition).
