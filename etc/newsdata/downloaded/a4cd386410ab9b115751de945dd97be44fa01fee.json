USA TODAY\n\nMorganna Cottrell, a busty blonde known as 'The Kissing Bandit' because she ran onto major league baseball fields to kiss unsuspecting players, is still puckering up at the age of 72.\n\n\u201cPut your cheek up against the phone,\u2019\u2019 she told a reporter during a recent interview. \u201cReady?\u2019\u2019\n\nThen came the sound of big kiss. Twice.\n\n\u201cI gave you two 'cause I really like you,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nMorganna still adores baseball, too, and as the World Series approaches she is celebrating her major league debut, so to speak. According to Morganna, it was in 1969 that she ran onto the field during a Cincinnati Reds home game and kissed Pete Rose on the cheek. Other players such as Nolan Ryan and George Brett would follow.\n\nMorganna Cottrell shown in a recent photo says she wants 'to live to be 200 but not look over 100.' (Photo: Cotrrell family)\n\nOfficially retired from the Kissing Bandit act since 2000, Morganna retreated into obscurity. But during a rare interview, she discussed a variety of subjects, including he arrests, injuries and her comeback tour.\n\nActually, there will be no comeback tour.\n\n\u201cIt was fun, but there\u2019s a time and place for everything, I think,\u2019\u2019 Morganna said while noting she suffered a cracked knee cap, a broken tailbone and three cracked ribs at the hands of security. \u201cYou know, sometimes the rent-a-cops get a little carried away. That\u2019s just part of it. That and the jail is just part of it.\u2019\u2019\n\nA NEW AWARD: MLB needs a new award for the playoffs. Introducing the 'Jeter-Ortiz Cup'\n\nMorganna said she was arrested 19 times for running onto fields uninvited. She\u2019ll be safe from trespassing charges during the World Series because she will be watching the Washington Nationals-Houston Astros matchup on TV from her home in Ohio, where she lives with her husband, Bill, and her dog, Bella.\n\nMorganna Cottrell, shown in 1981, was known to interrupt games and kiss players in basketball, football and hockey. (Photo: AP)\n\nEvery December, they head to Florida.\n\n\u201cBecause I have a Chihuahua mixed dog who doesn\u2019t like the cold and she doesn\u2019t like to wear sweaters,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSo I always say I go for Bella. Taco Bella, I call her.\n\n\u201cI go to the gym almost every day. I love to work out. I always have, my entire life. I don\u2019t shop. I hate to shop. I don\u2019t like spending money and I don\u2019t like trying stuff on, so everybody says, \u2018Boy, did your husband get lucky.\u2019\n\n\"Years ago for my birthday, he said, \u2018Where do you want to go for your birthday?\u2019 I said, \u2018Costco, because I love their hot dogs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAside from those Costco hot dogs, Morganna says she takes good care of herself these days.\n\n\u201cI want to live to be 200 but not look over 100,\u2019\u2019 Morganna said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not having plastic surgery because that\u2019s when you look 200 when you\u2019re 200. Nope, what you see is what you get.\u2019\u2019\n\nBaseball got its first glimpse of Morganna a half century ago during a Reds home game she said she attended with two friends.\n\n\u201cAnd it seemed like all the Reds were looking our way and spittin\u2019 tobacco, which was a compliment back in those days,\u2019\u2019 Morganna said. \u201cNow they chew bubble gum or sunflower seeds. But they all seemed to notice me and my two girlfriends, except for Pete.\u2019\u2019\n\nEnticed by \u201cdouble-dirty dare\u2019\u2019 from her friend, Morganna recalled, she ran onto the field and headed for Rose.\n\n\u201cI remember at the time he was doing commercials for ballpark franks,\u2019\u2019 Morganna said. \u201cI ran up to him and said, \u2018Pete, I buy your hot dogs.\u2019 And he turned to me, and I remember exactly what he said, \u2018You crazy blanking broad.\u2019 But he used a big word, \u2018Are you out of your blanking mind?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then I gave him a kiss on the cheek and I ran off and that was about it for that that romantic moment.\u2019\u2019\n\nDozens of moments followed on major league baseball fields, although Morganna eventually branched out to basketball, football and hockey.\n\n\u201cAnd hockey, I don\u2019t know how when they get hit in the face and have to be sewn up almost every game they can still stay so handsome,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the weird thing in hockey.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlmost 20 years after retiring, Morganna said, she still gets fan mail. The thought of it triggered a memory.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like when I kissed Pete Rose Jr. at a minor league game,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI said, \u2018Tell you Daddy, 'Hi and \u2018I\u2019ll try to hang in there and not get wrinkled before there\u2019s a Pete Rose III.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "Morganna Cottrell recalls her career as \"The Kissing Bandit\" 50 years after running onto the field to give Pete Rose a smooch.", "authors": ["Josh Peter", "Published A.M.
