But what if that was the whole purpose that a particular make seeks to serve? Toyota is playing on these lines now, having unveiled its Ultra-Compact Battery-Electric Vehicle recently.\n\nAs the name suggests, the new EV by Toyota is a compact, two-seater vehicle fit for those limited to in-city commute. To have an idea of how compact the car is, know that its length is 2,490 mm, width is 1,290 mm and it stands at a total height of 1,550 mm. The figures are much smaller than those of Mahindra E2O.\n\nSince the whole motive of the electric car lies far off from long hauls, the range promised on a single charge is limited to 100 km. Charging time for the same has been mentioned to be around 5 hours. The top speed is limited too, a maximum of 60 kmph.\n\nToyota will be coming up with more information around the compact electric vehicle during the Tokyo Motor Show scheduled for next week. Till the time, let us have a look at whether the Ultra-Compact Battery-Electric Vehicle will be ideal for India, or not.\n\nToyota Ultra Compact BEV (Image: Toyota)\n\nDon't Miss 416 SHARES 403 SHARES 563 SHARES\n\nGood for crowded Indian cities\n\nA compact car like this will be a great asset for those indulged in within-city commute on a daily basis. With that perspective, the potential buyers of the vehicle will be the elderly as well as those who have just started to drive.\n\nInterestingly, Indians are not unaware of such a build type. At a glance, the electric car will remind you of Mahindra Reva, the first electric car that made its way to the country\u2019s market. It did not take off much in terms of sales. But that can also be blamed on the inadequate setup to support an electric car in India, including the charging network. That is set to change soon though.\n\nIn an ideal scenario, the electric car can serve well to those facing the city traffic everyday. The compact build will help skim through the traffic and find easy parking spots. The electric nature will make sure it is environment-friendly. In addition, it will be easier on the pocket too, in comparison with a fossil fuel run vehicle.\n\nThe limitations\n\nThe perks, however, do not overshadow the limitations of such a vehicle. With a range of 100 km, it definitely can not be taken outside the city. Additionally, the notion of a \u201ccar\u201d allowing you to seat 4 to 5 passengers can be forgotten with this one.\n\nTo think of it, even the in-city travel will be a bit restricted. Considering the distance from Noida to Gurugram to be near 60 km, you will have to charge the car at some point for a single return trip. Bummer, eh? And with the current charging infrastructure across the country, one cannot totally count on that.\n\nToyota Ultra Compact BEV (Image: Toyota)\n\nIs it for you?\n\nConsidering it to be a compact car with limited range and a top speed, the Ultra-Compact Battery-Electric Vehicle by Toyota will be priced accordingly. So chances are, it will not be a burden on the pocket at all. That being said, it is an electric vehicle and with the present costs of lithium-ion batteries, it will definitely be costlier than a similar IC engine make.\n\nBut that can be ignored. Basically for a smoother drive, increased comfort and a greener travel. Also, the prevalent subsidies on electric vehicles in India should be a help. Still, if one is to be sure to buy this car, chances are, they would have another one in the garage already.\n\nIt is not confirmed whether the vehicle will be making its way to India. But if it does, will it be able to attract consumers, or will it fight with the limitations it possesses?
