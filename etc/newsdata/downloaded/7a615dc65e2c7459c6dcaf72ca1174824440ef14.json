Every year we had barbecues for groups of visiting commentators and athletes.\u201d\n\nAlthough the couple will be relocating to Sydney, Mr McAvaney said they will return to Glenelg \u2013 having purchased an apartment in the new Ei8ht development in Glenelg South.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve bought an apartment just up the road that we\u2019ll be able to lock up and leave,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will miss the community for the few months that we\u2019re relocating to Sydney. But what we will miss the most is hearing the ocean, even when it\u2019s stormy, it\u2019s spectacular. We can wake up in the morning and clearly see dolphins swimming while we\u2019re still lying in bed.\u201d\n\nSelling agent Karen Dorman said the tightly-held location would undoubtedly prove popular with buyers.\n\n\u201cI think it could attract families, a professional couple or someone that wants to scale down in that location,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also a potential interstate market, some people could look at it as a weekender.\u201d\n\nThe home features an open-plan living, dining and kitchen area, a private lounge and living room, a family bathroom, a laundry and an outdoor entertainment area on the ground floor.\n\nHead upstairs and you will find the master suite complete with ocean views, a walk-in robe and ensuite. You will also find three bedrooms, a family bathroom and a family area, plus access to the sweeping balcony.\n\nExpressions of interest will close on Thursday, October 31 at noon.", "description": "Prominent sports commentator\u00a0Bruce McAvaney is saying goodbye to his million dollar Glenelg South home, which he has shared with\u00a0TV producer wife Anne Johnson\u00a0for the past 20 years.", "authors": ["Chloe Metcalfe"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17003049/capi_7c7754331921e255d74a4dda1997301b_b84f69c4b0d2de80e83c8d2860668346.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
