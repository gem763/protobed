She was indicted on a murder charge two months later.\n\nAMBER GUYGER SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IN SHOOTING THAT KILLED BOTHAM JEAN IN DALLAS; VICTIM'S BROTHER HUGS HER IN COURT\n\nFollowing Wednesday's sentencing, Judge Tammy Kemp comforted Jean's family, then briefly spoke with Guyger and left the room. The judge soon returned with a Bible, WFAA-TV of Dallas reported.\n\n\u201cYou just need a tiny mustard seed of faith. You start with this,\u201d she said, giving the Bible to Guyger.\n\nKemp and Guyger then embraced. The hug came after the brother of murder victim Botham Jean made a similar gesture toward Guyger.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t done so much that you can\u2019t be forgiven,\u201d the judge told Guyger, according to WFAA. \u201cYou did something bad in one moment in time. What you do now matters.\"\n\nProtesters and some on social media decried both the sentencing and Kemp\u2019s embrace of Guyger.\n\n\u201c[T]his judge choosing to hug this woman is unacceptable,\" Atlantic columnist Jemele Hill wrote on Twitter. \u201cKeep in mind this convicted murderer is the same one who laughed about Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s assassination, and killing ppl on sight.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe courtroom was brought to tears earlier when Jean\u2019s brother hugged Guyger and said, \"I don't even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you because I know that's exactly what Botham would want.\"\n\nFox News' Vandana Rambaran contributed to this report.", "description": "A judge in the murder trial of a former Dallas police officer sentenced to 10 years for fatally shooting her neighbor caused a stir Wednesday when she hugged the defendant after the trial.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/AP19276009856037.jpg"}
