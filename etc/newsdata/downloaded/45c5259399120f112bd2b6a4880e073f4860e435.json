There are many different factors involved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut given that global warming is likely to have an adverse effect on our ability to produce food, we all have a responsibility to reduce wastage.\n\nHere are some simple steps you can take to waste less food.\n\nUse an app\n\nHappily, there are a wide range of apps available that can help you reduce food wastage\n\nTake Olio, which bears the tagline: \u2018When did sharing food become weirder than wasting it?\u2019 The app connects people who have too much food and want to share it, with people who would like to eat said food.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially Freecycle for snacks.\n\nToo Good to Go does something similar, except it\u2019s aimed at restaurants, cafes and bakeries who want to sell almost out-of-date food at reduced prices. As well as being good for the environment, this can be a great way of getting delicious meals for way cheaper than normal.\n\nApps like No Waste and Kitche, meanwhile, help you avoid wasting the food you\u2019ve already purchased, with expiration reminders and meal-planning features.\n\nBe more mindful when you\u2019re shopping\n\nDoing a \u2018big shop\u2019 and \u2018meal prep\u2019 are cornerstones of what some might refer to as \u2018adulting\u2019, activities which suggest you\u2019re a responsible and organised human being.\n\nBut doing a big shop is also more likely to result in food wastage. Being so disorganized that you only ever figure out what you want to eat on the day might end up being better for the environment \u2013 this might be a spartan and needlessly expensive way to live, but it\u2019s less likely to result in wastage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe disorganised people with perennially empty fridges stay winning \u2013 in this one respect only.\n\nIf you\u2019re committed to the big shop, then it\u2019s a good idea to make a list beforehand and stick to it and make a proper meal plan for the week. That way, you\u2019re less likely to end up with more food than you need.\n\nTry to remember what foods you have wasted in the past, and then use this to adjust your lists going forward. If you\u2019re chucking out twelve eggs per week then, you know, buy fewer eggs.\n\nThe freezer is your friend\n\nThere are few greater pleasures in life than picking up a loaf of nearly out-of-date Hovis at the supermarket for 12 pence and whacking it straight in the freezer.\n\nWe should aim to apply this level of thriftiness to all of our food. Bread, fruits and vegetables can all be frozen, along with most leftovers (you might want to avoid freezing fried meals or anything containing a lot of dairy.)\n\nWhen freezing food in bags, make sure you get as much air out of the bag as possible. Excess air can cause \u2018freezer burn\u2019 which isn\u2019t unsafe, but can affect the taste.\n\nIf you\u2019re eating at a restaurant, don\u2019t be ashamed to ask for a doggy bag\n\nIf you\u2019ve paid good money for food you enjoyed, but couldn\u2019t finish, it\u2019s fair enough to want to take it home to eat later.\n\nYou can pretend to be motivated by a desire to solve global hunger, if it makes you feel less embarrassed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t throw away food too soon (as 90% of us do)\n\nIf vegetables are wilted, you can usually revive them by soaking them in ice water for 15 minutes. If this doesn\u2019t work, they might still work well in a cooked dish.\n\nBe aware of when the ingredients in your fridge are due to be past their use-by-date. When they\u2019re nearing this point, try to use them up in a recipe.\n\nIt\u2019s not advisable to use food after its use-by-date, even if it looks and smells fine \u2013 unless you\u2019re hankering after a bout of the norovirus.\n\nBut the \u2018best before\u2019 date is a lot more elastic and you shouldn\u2019t rush to throw out food once it has passed this point.\n\nHelp raise awareness\n\nThe World Food Programme is encouraging people to find an item in their fridge they\u2019ve forgotten about (but which is still safe to eat) then take a selfie with it, accompanied by the hashtag #stopthewaste, and tag three friends to challenge them to do the same.\n\nThey don\u2019t specifically say you should eat the food afterwards, but it would be kind of hypocritical not to.\n\nAbout 1/3 of food produced for human consumption worldwide is wasted.
