They're just pregnant.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"It's not my fault. I didn't get them pregnant.\"\n\nFormer X Factor star Stacey asked: \"What if a pregnant woman needed a seat?\"\n\nCarol replied that if they wanted a seat they should have booked.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nSome fans didn't take kindly to Carol's attitude, one tweeting: \"I think Carol should do an experiment, pretend to be pregnant for the day and put her on a train.\"\n\nAnother was completely on board with Carol, writing: \"Completely agree with Carol. Getting pregnant is a choice, getting old is not. #LooseWomen.\"\n\nAnother really took issue: \"Oh my god I could swing for Carol. 'Pregnant women are pregnant not ill.' Boils my blood when people say this, especially as I'm 20 weeks in to a difficult pregnancy and still throwing up all day every day. Pregnancy is definitely not a walk in the park.\"\n\nA third was a Carol fan but disagreed: \"Oh Carol! I normally love Carol but a bit of a lack of empathy there! Oh my, at the end of pregnancy any poor lady could be so uncomfortable that I would defo let them sit down!\n\n\"The lower back aches! The leaking bladder!\"\n\nA fourth was completely on board with Carol, writing: \"Completely agree with Carol. Getting pregnant is a choice, getting old is not. #LooseWomen.\"\n\n*Loose Women airs weekdays at 12.30pm on ITV", "description": "The Loose Women were chatting about giving up train seats for the elderly when Kaye made a brutal dig at Carol", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Itv", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20723397.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Loose-Womens-Kaye-Adams-insults-Carol-McGiffin-over-age-in-brutal-dig.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
