After covering a rally by the group Act on a Dream and their demands to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month, the Crimson contacted ICE for comment on the rally.\n\nFor some reason, that \u201cproved controversial with many of our readers.\u201d It did? No really, it did, as Act on a Dream accused the newspaper of threatening the welfare of Harvard students \u2026 for asking ICE for a comment after the demonstration:\n\nMore than 650 people have signed onto an online petition condemning The Harvard Crimson\u2019s coverage of a protest demanding the abolition of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The petition \u2014 started by student-led immigration advocacy group Act on a Dream earlier this month \u2014 criticizes The Crimson for requesting comment from an ICE spokesperson for its Sept. 13 article, \u201cHarvard Affiliates Rally for Abolish ICE Movement.\u201d The article covers a Sept. 12 protest hosted by Act on a Dream and quotes several students\u2019 criticisms of ICE, including calls for its dissolution. The article notes that ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cIn this political climate, a request for comment is virtually the same as tipping [ICE] off, regardless of how they are contacted,\u201d the petition reads. \u201cThe Crimson, as a student-run publication, has a responsibility to prioritize the safety of the student body they are reporting on \u2014 they must reexamine and interrogate policies that place students under threat.\u201d\n\nTipping them off to what, exactly? By that logic, the newspaper shouldn\u2019t have even reported on the demonstration. Why, that might have \u201ctipped\u201d off ICE that it took place!\n\nThis illogical complaint would get laughed out of an average high-school logic class, but not at Hahvahd. Ten other campus groups joined the petition by Act on a Dream demanding that the Crimson stop contacting ICE and presumably every other bete noire against which they protest on campus for a normal opportunity to defend themselves in the media. The petition demands that the Crimson not only change its policies but also \u201capologize for \u201cthe harm they inflicted\u201d on undocumented students, and declare a commitment to protecting undocumented students on campus.\u201d These groups have now launched a boycott of the student newspaper to demand that they comply with their agenda.\n\nTo the credit of the Crimson and its current leadership, the newspaper published an editorial yesterday politely telling the woke brigade to go pound sand. Their mission is journalism, wrote president Kristine Guillaume and managing editor Angela Fu, and they have no interest in acting as the mere mouthpiece for thuggish groups:\n\nAt stake here, we believe, is one of the core tenets that defines America\u2019s free and independent press: the right \u2014 and prerogative \u2014 of reporters to contact any person or organization relevant to a story to seek that entity\u2019s comment and view of what transpired. This ensures the article is as thorough, balanced, and unbiased toward any particular viewpoint as possible. A world where news outlets categorically refuse to contact certain kinds of sources \u2014 a world where news outlets let third-party groups dictate the terms of their coverage \u2014 is a less informed, less accurate, and ultimately less democratic world. Experts from the Student Press Law Center and the Society of Professional Journalists have affirmed that The Crimson followed ethical journalistic practices in its reporting in this case and that its request for comment did not place any person in harm\u2019s way. The SPJ Code of Ethics states that journalists should \u201cdiligently seek subjects of news coverage to allow them to respond to criticisms or allegations of wrongdoing.\u201d We understand that some readers may disagree with The Crimson\u2019s policies. But our mission is facts, truth, narrative, and understanding. In our view, consistent application of a commonly accepted set of journalistic standards is the best way to fairly report on the campus in a sensitive and thorough manner.\n\nUnfortunately for the Crimson, at least a couple of their reporters haven\u2019t learned their Journalism 101 lessons:\n\nBut some of the Crimson\u2019s own staff have joined in the calls to stop contacting ICE for any story. Emily Romero, an associate editorial editor for the paper who says she is undocumented, tweeted her support of the protests and wrote that \u201cit pains me to feel unsafe in the building I have devoted countless hours to.\u201d Another member of the editorial staff, Jessenia Class, wrote on Twitter that the paper\u2019s decision to continue reaching out to the subjects of stories for comment was disappointing and \u201cantithetical to our journalistic values of reporting with sensitivity.\u201d\n\nAnyone who believes that reaching out for comment from parties substantially involved in a factually reported story is \u201cantithetical to our journalistic values\u201d is someone without any journalistic values at all. Journalism involves reporting the facts of events and providing as much context as possible. \u201cReporting with sensitivity\u201d is narrative-building, serving a cause, not journalism. As far as \u201cfeel[ing] unsafe in the building,\u201d that\u2019s a product of the reporter\u2019s own status, not any action of the newspaper and certainly has nothing to do with journalistic values and practices. It speaks to a personal bias that doesn\u2019t belong in the news section, although to be fair Romero works on the opinion pages.\n\nOne would think those students who manage to get admitted to Harvard could easily grasp the points Guillaume and Fu have made. Perhaps a new requirement for remedial logic should be added to the curriculum. In the meantime, the best way to make these groups happy is to simply stop reporting on their events at all, except to the extent that they do damage or run riot. That ought to make these activists feel \u201csafe,\u201d and perhaps teach them that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them, too.", "description": "\"They must reexamine and interrogate policies that place students under threat.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/facepalm-newspaper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
