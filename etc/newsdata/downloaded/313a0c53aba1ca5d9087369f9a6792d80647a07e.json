The \"Rocky\" franchise, with Stallone on board for the ride, has gone on to bring 8 movies to fans for more than over 40+ years, with a box office gross of about $963 million.\n\nStallone is not alone. Arnold Schwarzenegger continues to turn out \"Terminator\" films at 72. In November, Schwarzenegger will star in \"Terminator: Dark Fate,\" the sixth film in the franchise that dates back to the 1984 original.\n\nDenzel Washington, at 64, continues to pack in action-lovers too. \u201cThe Equalizer 2,\u201d Washington\u2019s 2018 sequel to the original brought in a whopping $190 million in ticket sales.\n\n\u201cStallone and Eastwood are aging but they are also an inspiration. People go to the movies to see actors they love and that they have grown up with that aren\u2019t giving up or resting with their health,\" Max Wasa, an actress, stunt professional and producer, told FOX Business.\n\nClint Eastwood, also known as \u201cDirty Harry\u201d from the 1971 action movie, has gone from middle-aged cowboy in his crowd-pleasing \"Pale Rider\u201d in 1985, to geriatric drug dealer in 2018\u2019s \u201cThe Mule.\u201d At 89 years old, the director and movie star is showing no signs of retiring or slowing down.\n\n\u201cThey are our idols and they are who we look up to,\" Wasa said. \"Their longevity is due to the fact that people love to see how great they are doing and how well they take care of themselves.\"\n\nAnd staying in shape is critical to being able to play an action star, especially one who qualifies for a senior discount.\n\n\"These guys always stay in shape, they always take care of themselves and that makes it easier to maintain,\" Gunnar Peterson, celebrity personal trainer told FOX Business. \"Bruce Willis has been training with me consistently for 13 years, and Sly Stallone has worked with me on and off for 20 years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIt takes a big crew to keep these older stars safe so they do not kill themselves jumping off buildings for movie fans. \u201cEvery time you see an older action hero, you have to remember there is a professional team of stunt people behind him, keeping him safe, making him look good,\u201d explains Wasa.\n\n\u201cWhile it may look like they are doing the stunt, that is not always the case, so you have to give credit where credit is due,\u201d says Wasa.", "description": "Why does Hollywood loves aging action heroes so much?", "authors": ["Mike Cherico"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/Sly-Stallone-Rocky.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
