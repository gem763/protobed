It was published a week before the UN Climate Action Summit.\n\nAmazon's indigenous warriors take on invading loggers and ranchers Read more\n\nRicardo Salles, Brazil\u2019s environment minister in the government of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, has argued that poverty drives degradation, and that development of the Amazon will help stop deforestation.\n\nBut the report\u2019s author, Cesar Mu\u00f1oz Acebes, argues that Amazon needs to be better policed.\n\n\u201cAs long as you have this level of violence, lawlessness and impunity for the crimes committed by these criminal groups it will be impossible for Brazil to rein in deforestation,\u201d he said. \u201cThese criminal networks will attack anyone who stands in their way.\u201d\n\nThe report documents 28 killings in which it found evidence that \u201cthose responsible were engaged in illegal deforestation and saw their victims as obstacles\u201d.\n\nVictims included indigenous people, forest residents and environmental agents, and only two cases went to trial. It cites \u201cserious flaws\u201d in investigations of six killings. More than 300 killings were counted by the Pastoral Land Commission, a not-for-profit group connected to the Catholic church, over the last decade in the Amazon, of which just 14 went to trial.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of deforestation taken on 22 September 2017. Photograph: Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOfficials and environmentalists told the Guardian the report echoed their experiences working in the Amazon.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of people, a lack of resources, a lack of logistics and a lack of will,\u201d said Antonio de Oliveira, a retired federal police officer previously seconded to indigenous agency Funai. He worked with the Guardians, a brigade of Guajajara indigenous people who forcibly expel loggers from their heavily depleted Ararib\u00f3ia reserve in Maranh\u00e3o state on the east of the Amazon.\n\nOliveira received several death threats and came under fire from loggers during one operation, when an environment agency official sitting next to him was hit in the arm. Nobody was jailed.\n\nHe agreed with the report\u2019s assertion that illegal loggers have become more brazen since Bolsonaro launched a strong series of attacks on environmental agencies for levying fines and destroying loggers\u2019 equipment, and promised to develop protected environment areas.\n\n\u201cThe situation has got worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a sort of encouragement to people to enter, to invade.\u201d\n\nPaulo Bonavigo, president of Ecopor\u00e9, a not-for-profit group in Rond\u00f4nia working on sustainable forest projects, said loggers operate freely in one protected area his group monitors. \u201cThere are lookouts, there is a radio network. These guys are organised,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking anonymously because environment agencies officials are banned from talking to the media, an employee from the Chico Mendes Institute who worked in Par\u00e1 state said the men working on illegal deforestation and mining in the forest are badly paid, poorly educated and exploited by rich bosses. \u201cDeforestation is not exactly slave work but it is not far off.\u201d\n\n'Chaos, chaos, chaos': a journey through Bolsonaro's Amazon inferno Read more\n\nBolsonaro has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d of environmental crime. But he and his ministers also called international concern over the Amazon an attack on Brazilian sovereignty, rubbished official government data as lies, and said they will counter deforestation by developing the Amazon.\n\nMany involved in land grabbing, illegal mining and deforestation in protected areas voted for Bolsonaro \u2013 including a group of gold miners who recently blocked an Amazon highway recently and called on him for support after a recent crackdown by environmental agencies.\n\nOn Friday the foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, agreed to promote private sector development in the Amazon and announced a $100m biodiversity conservation fund led by private sector.\n\nThe same day, the finance minister, Paulo Guedes, told foreign reporters that \u201cthere is still a precarious scientific basis\u201d to climate change science. \u201cWe will sustainably develop the Amazon,\u201d Guedes said.\n\n", "description": "Criminals threaten and attack government officials, forest defenders and indigenous people, Human Rights Watch finds", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e21229f5132a59b538661b5897aee87cc57ac852/0_123_2480_1489/master/2480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ebc5a93331731b0b8e72d0e5737f68ab", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
