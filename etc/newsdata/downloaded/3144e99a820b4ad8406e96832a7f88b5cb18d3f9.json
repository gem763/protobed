The 41 feet tall sculpture has been installed in a garden next to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\n\nThe attacks, which took place on Nov. 13, 2015, targeted six locations across the city across the city, killing 130 people and injuring 494.\n\nKoons said the sculpture was a way of showing solidarity with the victims and their families and reflected on his own post-9/11 experiences in the US.\n\n\"I did, as a citizen in New York experience 9/11 and the depression that hung over the city,\" he said, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It really took years for the city to be able to come to life again.\"\n\nKoons holds the record for the most expensive artwork by a living artist sold at auction.

The flowers are generally perceived as a symbol of love.\n\nArt critic Yves Michaud wrote in the Le Nouvel Observateur magazine that the tulips looked like \"11 colorful anuses mounted on rods.\"\n\nIn an excoriating assessment, he called the artwork a \"pornographic sculpture\" that is part of an \"irresponsible massacre of the urban landscape in Paris.\"\n\nReactions on Twitter have been mixed as well. Eric Naulleau, a French TV presenter and literary critic, defined the work as \"despicable.\"\n\nOne Twitter user, Rosa Rosam, claimed that young Parisians would now believe that tulips were \"big colored marshmallows,\" and another, Gilles Brandet, called the artist's work \"eye-candy for philistines.\" More criticism came from Dani\u00e8le Pain, who took a cue from Michaud's piece and went as far as calling the work a \"homage to hemorrhoids.\"\n\nJeff Koons unveils the controversial sculpture \"Bouquet of Tulips.\" Credit: Francois Mori/AP\n\nParis mayor Anne Hidalgo, however, said she was happy to unveil the sculpture, which she called \"a beautiful gift\" in a tweet.\n\nOthers called the work \" very pretty \" or said they were \" delighted \" by the tulips.\n\nKoons will donate 80% of the proceeds of the copyright of the work to the families of the victims of the 2015 attacks.\n\nCNN has contacted Koons' representatives for comment.\n\nThe sculpture was initially scheduled to be installed in 2017 and at a different location, in front of the Palais de Tokyo museum, but the pavement there was deemed not sturdy enough to sustain the heavy artwork, which weighs 34 tons. That choice of location also attracted criticism from a group of French artists and politicians, who published an open letter in the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration in early 2018, asking for the gift to be taken back and suggesting that the initiative amounted to publicity and product placement.\n\nIn May, 64-year-old Koons' \"Rabbit\" sculpture became the most expensive work by a living artist ever to sell at auction.\n\nThe stainless steel figure, which measures just over 3 feet tall, sold for more than $91 million at a Christie's sale in New York.", "description": "A new sculpture by American artist Jeff Koons, unveiled last week to honor the victims of the 2015 Paris terror attacks, is attracting criticism in the French capital.", "authors": ["Jack Guy"], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191008044837-02-jeff-koons-bataclan-sculpture-scli-intl-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
