Here\u2019s a guide in words and pictures.\n\nBy Photographs by\n\nSept. 17, 2019\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Tuesday\u2019s do-over election in Israel may not, by itself, decide who will be the next prime minister. That could take weeks of arduous coalition negotiations.\n\nBut the vote will almost certainly provide fresh evidence that the United States has nothing on this country when it comes to identity politics.\n\nThe April election was the first I\u2019d covered as a foreign correspondent in Israel, and it shocked me that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly expressed desperation in the campaign\u2019s final days and hours. At 11:25 p.m. on the night before votes were cast, he even had his American pollster join him on camera to declare, gravely, \u201cRight now, we\u2019re losing the race.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, political candidates are programmed never to let the voters see them sweat, no matter how abysmal the poll numbers.
