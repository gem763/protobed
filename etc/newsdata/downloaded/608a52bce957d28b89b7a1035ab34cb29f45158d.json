The leading cryptocurrency is now trading for $9,600 \u2014 up a tad under 10% from Saturday\u2019s low of $8,900. Altcoins have largely followed BTC higher, posting similar gains.\n\nWhile the resurgence from Saturday\u2019s low has made many analysts bullish, there is evidence to suggest that Bitcoin will take a short breather over the next couple of hours, maybe days. Here\u2019s why.\n\nWhy Bitcoin Could See Slight Pullback\n\nFirst and foremost, there is purportedly a short-term bearish divergence playing out on Bitcoin\u2019s chart. According to analyst CryptoHamster, the bearish divergence is forming as BTC\u2019s price has rallied and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has sunk, implying a short drawdown that may take the cryptocurrency below $9,000 once again.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. Trader BigCheds noted that Bitcoin has been struggling to hold the 8 exponential moving average for the asset\u2019s one-hour chart, is showing signs of a reversal to $9,400, and has been seeing a number of bearish divergences starting to resolve.\n\n$BTC #Bitcoin 1 hour \u2013 Struggling to hold EMA 8, may need to cool off for a bit pic.twitter.com/s8KwZ014ww \u2014 Big Cheds (@BigCheds) October 27, 2019\n\nAlso, the CME\u2019s BTC futures just printed a massive $1,000 gap between Friday\u2019s close of $8,700 and the weekly open of $9,700.\n\nThis might not mean anything on its own. But, Bitcoin has had a history of filling the gap, moving down or up to prices where the CME\u2019s market didn\u2019t trade at. Just look to this chart from Richard Heart, which shows that nearly every single daily CME gap has been filled by BTC in the weeks that followed a gap\u2019s creation.\n\nLong-Term Trend Shaping Positive\n\nRegardless of the short-term, Bitcoin\u2019s long-term picture is starting to favor bulls yet again.\n\nAn analyst going by \u201cJB\u201d pointed out that with this latest move from $7,700 to $9,700, Bitcoin\u2019s three-day chart is looking extremely bullish.\n\nHe drew attention to the following reasons to back his prediction: the recent candle can be defined as a \u201cbullish engulfing candle,\u201d a descending trend line that originated at June\u2019s $14,000 top was broken, markets have seen their biggest volume day in months, the MACD is printing a bullish divergence, and the Willy indicator is now leaving oversold territory.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) bulls have started to push the cryptocurrency markets into the weekly close, which is set to take place in minutes as of the time of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_1397279576-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
