The Peanut app, which launched in 2017, is making it easier for mums to make friends and plan meet-ups in their area.\n\nWhy do grown women need help making friends? Because even if you have plenty of friends, if most of them don\u2019t have kids (or live near you), new parenthood can be isolating. Your friends care, but they don\u2019t fully grasp how depleted you are. And it\u2019s hard to come up with just the right pick-up line to use on the other parent at the playground that will help you strike up a friendship with a perfect stranger.\n\nWe wrote about the Peanut app back when it was brand new, but it wasn\u2019t old enough to have many users then, you only had the option to log in via your Facebook account and it didn\u2019t have the added message board component. You can now log in via Facebook, Google or by entering and confirming your phone number. And if you don\u2019t necessarily want to meet up with new potential friends for coffee or a playdate, you can still use the message boards to connect with and ask questions of other mums in your area.\n\nThe size of your area matters\n\nThe app is most useful if there are a lot of users in your area. One parent in our Facebook group who lives in a small town tried the app, but with only 36 local users and just one post on the message boards, it didn\u2019t do much for her. The larger your city or town, the more robust you can expect the experience to be. In my city of approximately 75,000 residents, there are more than 800 users on the app, and the messages boards are fairly lively with topics like schools, pediatricians and local activities and events.\n\nThere are also groups for people in your state or who have similar interests\u2014in my area, there is a book club group, a pregnancy group and a meet-up group, for example.\n\nYeah, it can be kind of clich\u00e9\n\nA lot of the design and vocabulary on the site can be a little cheesy. It\u2019s a lot of \u201cmama this\u201d and \u201cmama that.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Peanut\n\nYou have to select three categories that are \u201cyour thing\u201d and the options include, unfortunately, things like \u201cwine time\u201d and \u201chot mess.\u201d But there are also options like \u201cneighbourhood newbie\u201d for someone who just moved to the area, \u201csingle mama,\u201d \u201cstep mama\u201d and \u201cLGBTQ,\u201d all of which are helpful for mums who are trying to find friends who can relate to their specific situation.\n\nDads have to go elsewhere\n\nDads need friends as well, but there are no dads allowed on Peanut. (I had to take a selfie through the app to confirm my gender, which isn\u2019t exactly a foolproof way to keep men from joining.)\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find a good Peanut equivalent for dads, but there are other pregnancy and parenting apps out there geared toward men\u2014there is a good list here.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to be forever friends\n\nA couple of parents in our Offspring Facebook Parenting Group have used the app just to connect with other mums during their maternity leave. Here\u2019s what Lauren said about her experience:\n\nI used it while on maternity leave with my second kiddo. Though a couple mums didn\u2019t respond to my outreach, I ended up finding a mum with a similar-aged baby who became my coffee compatriot. We got together a handful of times\u2014it was such an easy way to meet someone new in a similar phase of motherhood. And though our time has been more crunched since both returning to work, we share articles and milestones over text (like a digital pen pal) and get together every few months. I only really made the one contact, but I was so grateful for the app\u2014I felt way less isolated than my first leave.\n\nSo even if you\u2019re just looking for a little company/commiseration during a particularly isolating phase of parenthood, Peanut may be able to help you make a connection.\n\nThe app is free and available on iOS and Android.", "description": "Users sarcastically refer to it as \u201cTinder for mums,\u201d but it really kind of is.
