I just thought \"fair enough\". I couldn't even tell her off for it because it was just too funny. I was more overwhelmed than anything.\n\n'I couldn't believe it. I shouted my partner down and she said \"there's no way she has eaten all of them\". But I told her, \"I think she has because she's just told me she has\". It really made us laugh.\n\n'Then I thought \"why haven't I taken a photo of this?\". I put it on Snapchat at first, but my friends told me it needed to go on Facebook and it's gone mad.'\n\nAfter wiping all the yoghurt off his little one's face, Arron decided to take a snap as proof of Olivia's (pictured) incredible feat and posted it on social media\n\nAs his fiancee Billie Hardie, 26, was doing her hair, and their two children (pictured all together) were busy 'doing their own thing', Arron decided to take the opportunity to fix the fencing in their back garden\n\nAs his fianc\u00e9e Billie Hardie, 26, was doing her hair, and their children were busy 'doing their own thing', Arron decided to take the opportunity to fix the fencing in their back garden.\n\nThe parent kept popping in and out of the house to check on Olivia who was watching television in the kitchen and her brother Oscar, six, who was on his Playstation in the living room.\n\nWhen his son emerged to tell him Olivia was eating 'a yoghurt', Arron told Oscar not to worry as he knew Olivia could manage to open and eat the Petits Filous on her own.\n\nThe parent kept popping in and out of the house to check on Olivia who was watching television in the kitchen and her brother Oscar, six, (pictured together) who was on his Playstation in the living room\n\nBut walking in ten minutes later, the last thing he expected was to discover the youngster (pictured) had eaten every single yoghurt in the fridge\n\nBut when Arron went into the kitchen just 10 minutes later to make sure Olivia hadn't made a mess, the last thing he expected was to discover the youngster had eaten every single yoghurt in the fridge.\n\nMother-of-two Billie is a self-employed childminder and buys the dairy snacks in bulk to feed her own children and the youngsters she looks after.\n\nHowever her daughter's dairy frenzy meant Billie had to go back out on Sunday to buy more yoghurts - that are now being stored on the top shelf, beyond Olivia's reach.\n\nThe parents were worried the excessive dairy intake might upset Olivia's tummy but the little girl was her 'normal self' and still managed to polish off her dinner that night.\n\nArron said: 'She's such a little character, she keeps us busy.
