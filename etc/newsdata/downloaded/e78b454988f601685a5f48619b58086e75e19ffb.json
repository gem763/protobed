Prop Joe Marler and lock George Kruis are on the bench.\n\n\"Mako has been training exceptionally well. His ability to be influential warrants his selection,\" Jones said.\n\nThe two positional changes are Farrell's shift and Tuilagi's move from outside to inside centre.\n\n\"Australia defend a certain way and we believe those players can trouble their defence, defensively we feel that 10-12-13 (flyhalf, inside centre, outside centre) combination is a strong combination,\" said Jones.\n\n\"We believe those three guys are well-equipped to handle it,\" he added.\n\nAustralia centre Samu Kerevi has been one of the star players for a Wallabies side coached by Michael Cheika, a former team-mate of Jones's at Sydney club Randwick.\n\n\"Samu Kerevi is a good ball-carrier but we've got the capability to defend against him,\" said Jones.\n\n\"Australia are a good tournament team, they are well coached by Michael and we will have to play well to beat them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Billy Vunipola has recovered from the ankle injury he suffered against the Pumas almost a fortnight ago, with the powerful number eight proving his fitness in training on Wednesday.\n\nIn the backs, wing Jonny May - averaging a try every two games - wins his 50th cap.\n\nEngland have won all six of their Tests against Australia since Jones took over as coach after the 2015 World Cup, where the Wallabies condemned hosts England to a first-round exit with a 33-13 victory at Twickenham.\n\nBut former Japan coach Jones played down that record, saying: \"The great thing about a World Cup is each game is a match by itself.\n\n\"What you've done in the past doesn't affect what you do on Saturday.\"\n\nCheika, who oversaw that 2015 win over England, was due to name his side later on Thursday.\n\nTeams:\n\nEngland\n\n15 Elliot Daly, 14 Anthony Watson, 13 Henry Slade, 12 Manu Tuilagi, 11 Jonny May, 10 Owen Farrell (captain), 9 Ben Youngs, 8 Billy Vunipola, 7 Sam Underhill, 6 Tom Curry, 5 Courtney Lawes, 4 Maro Itoje, 3 Kyle Sinckler, 2 Jamie George, 1 Mako Vunipola\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17 Joe Marler, 18 Dan Cole, 19 George Kruis, 20 Lewis Ludlam, 21 Willi Heinz, 22 George Ford, 23 Jonathan Joseph\n\nAustralia\n\nTBA", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones insisted flyhalf George Ford has a \"significant role to play\" after he dropped him to the bench for their World Cup quarter-final against Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/218/c018f7e2a2994287bb4f79fcf3aae6bf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
