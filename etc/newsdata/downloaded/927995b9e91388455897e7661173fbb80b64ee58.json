Premiere Canceled as Celebs Flee Getty Fire", "language": "en", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A wildfire swept through the star-studded hills of Los Angeles on Monday, destroying several large homes and forcing LeBron James and thousands of others to flee. Meanwhile, a blaze in Northern California wine country exploded in size.\n\nThe flames that roared up a steep hillside near the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles\u2019 Brentwood section illustrated the danger the state faces as high winds batter both ends of California and threaten to turn any spark into a devastating inferno.\n\nNo deaths from either blaze were reported, but a firefighter was seriously injured in the fire in Sonoma County wine country.\n\nSome 2.2 million people lacked electricity after California\u2019s biggest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, shut it off over the weekend in the northern part of the state to prevent its equipment from sparking blazes during windy weather. More deliberate blackouts are possible in the coming days because another round of strong winds is expected.\n\nThe company, which was driven into bankruptcy after its equipment ignited several deadly wildfires in recent years, admitted Monday that despite the outages, its power lines may have started two smaller fires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nPG&E also has said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Sonoma County fire.\n\nThat blaze, which broke out last week amid the vineyards and wineries north of San Francisco, doubled in a day to at least 103 square miles (267 square kilometers), destroying 96 buildings, including at least 40 homes, and threatening 80,000 more structures, authorities said.\n\nAbout 156,000 people were under evacuation orders because of the fire, mostly from the city of Santa Rosa.\n\nThe flames didn\u2019t discriminate. In wine country, farmworkers who toil in the vineyards were among those displaced. In Los Angeles, James and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger were driven from their homes.\n\n\u201cMan these LA (fires) are no joke,\u201d the Los Angeles Lakers star tweeted, using an emoji for the word \u201cfires.\u201d \u2033Crazy night.\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood premiere of Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u201cTerminator: Dark Fate\u201d was canceled Monday night.\n\nOthers who own homes in the evacuation zone include Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat running for president, who was not home at the time; Walt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger; and rapper and producer Dr. Dre.\n\nAnxious residents made their way down steep hillsides in the middle of the night in Range Rovers, Teslas and Maseratis. They left behind homes decorated for Halloween \u2014 skeletons hanging from homes, goblins sitting on front steps, cobwebs draped over bushes \u2014 as a plume of smoke glowed like a giant pumpkin.\n\nDavid Boyle, 78, awoke at 3 a.m. to his doorbell ringing and police officers pounding on the front door. They warned him the wildfire was advancing toward his house near the Getty complex.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018You need to evacuate.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018When?\u2019 They said, \u2018Now,\u2019\u201d Doyle said.\n\nHe grabbed dog food and his wife\u2019s jewelry and hustled his dogs out the door. They went to a recreation center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact of life when you live in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery place has some problem with disasters. People talk about earthquakes here, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as bad as hurricane season.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of people were ordered to clear out as the fire spread to more than 600 acres and burned at least five homes, authorities said.\n\nThe evacuation area extended west into Pacific Palisades, encompassing some of the most exclusive real estate in California, where celebrities and wealthy professionals live in estates nestled in canyons or on ridgetop retreats that cost tens of millions of dollars but are surrounded by tinder-dry vegetation.\n\nHours after homes had burned, some of the 1,000-plus firefighters battling the flames were hosing down smoldering ruins. Others attacked flare-ups in the brush-covered wilderness around neighborhoods.\n\nHelicopters beat the air, and the buzz of chain saws echoed from the canyons. Hills were charred black, and in some places, white ash was all that remained.\n\nThe fire shut down southbound lanes of Interstate 405, a major commuting corridor and the route to Los Angeles International Airport from the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe Getty, with its collection of priceless art, was not threatened, fire officials said. The museum gave assurances that its artworks are protected by state-of-the-art technology.\n\nBut Mount St. Mary\u2019s University evacuated 450 students from its nearby campus. And the University of California, Los Angeles, canceled classes \u2014 not because of any direct threat from the flames but because of disruptions caused by the fire.\n\nSimilarly in Northern California, some 40 school districts in Sonoma County canceled classes, as did the University of California, Berkeley, which had no power because of the outages.\n\nWith no rain and more wind in the forecast, the coming days could be grim.\n\n\u201cThis is when we have the most potential for large and damaging fires,\u201d said Thom Porter, chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \u201cAll of California is in play right now.\u201d\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the weekend.\n\nThe biggest evacuation was in Sonoma County, where some people who packed up and fled had done so two years ago, when devastating wildfires swept through the region, killing 44 people.\n\nAt an evacuation center at Napa Valley College, 15-year-old Francisco Alvarado said he, two younger brothers and his parents decided to leave their Calistoga home ahead of evacuation orders. Two years ago, the family had to flee in the middle of the night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty mad that we have to keep evacuating,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to be home. I\u2019m trying to leave here tomorrow. I want to sleep in my bed.\u201d", "description": "A wildfire swept through the star-studded hills of Los Angeles on Monday, the Hollywood premiere of Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u201cTerminator: Dark Fate\u201d was canceled.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/terminatorgettyfire1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
