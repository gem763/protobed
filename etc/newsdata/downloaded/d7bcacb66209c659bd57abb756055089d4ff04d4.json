Notably, cross-party talks have failed over leaders\u2019 unwillingness to accept Mr Corbyn as the interim prime minister of a proposed caretaker government.\n\nLabour's Brexit policy is a mystery to me: Agree: 66%\n\nDisagree: 18% 78% of Leave voters, 59% of Remain voters, and 47% of Labour voters agree. via @ComRes, 04 \u2013 06 Oct \u2014 Britain Elects (@britainelects) October 8, 2019\n\nJeremy Corbyn met with the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts, and Anna Soubry of the Independent Group for Change on Monday to discuss an emergency motion to take over the House of Commons and strengthen efforts against a clean-break Brexit.\n\nHowever, the other parties reportedly objected to making Corbyn the caretaker prime minister, blaming the socialist for getting in the way of stopping no-deal.\n\nOne Liberal Democrat source told the Metro: \u201cThe position Jeremy Corbyn is taking is that we can have an emergency Government, but only if he gets to lead it.\n\n\u201cThey know they don\u2019t have the numbers, but they are insistent they won\u2019t work with anyone else.\n\n\u201cTheir total unwillingness to work with anyone else makes the Labour Party the biggest barrier to stopping no-deal.\u201d\n\nLast month, Blair articulated his lack of confidence in Corbyn\u2019s prospects to be the next prime minister when he urged him to block a snap election. Remarking that voters may \u201cfear\u201d a Corbyn government, he said: \u201cThe opposition vote is going to split and under our system, that delivers a comfortable Tory majority.\u201d\n\nAs well as failing to join the leftist parties under one Remain roof, Labour is also failing to articulate clearly its position on Brexit. A ComRes poll revealed 66 per cent of Britons agreed that \u201cLabour\u2019s Brexit policy is a mystery to me\u201d. By party, that breaks down to 78 per cent of Leave voters, 59 per cent of Remain voters, and even nearly half \u2014 47 per cent \u2014 of Labour voters.\n\nA recent ComRes poll puts the Conservatives in the lead with 33 per cent of the vote, a comfortable 16 points ahead of Labour. Labour\u2019s confusing position on Brexit could also cost them votes. Corbyn\u2019s party has isolated its core working-class Leave voters by reneging on its pledge to respect the 2016 vote by backing a second referendum. However, some in the party want Labour to go farther left, joining the Liberal Democrats in supporting the cancellation Brexit altogether.", "description": "Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has blamed weak leadership in the Labour Party for making a clean-break Brexit a possibility.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Jeremy-Corbyn-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
