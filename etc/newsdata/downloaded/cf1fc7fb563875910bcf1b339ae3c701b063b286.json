The national party called on Facebook to take down false ads targeting the former vice president. It operates a second, more aggressive \u201cWar Room\u201d Twitter account that has been busy whacking Trump and Republicans. But the size of its following is just a fraction of the size of the national party account.\n\nThe party\u2019s low-key role in the recent fray is sparking a growing sense of frustration, according to interviews with nearly 20 DNC members and other prominent Democrats. There are complaints that the national party isn\u2019t delivering a digital counter-punch, that it\u2019s getting swamped by Republican fundraising, and doing little to combat an onslaught of incoming TV ads targeting Biden on Ukraine. And they lament that Democrats lack a prominent voice who is providing anything like the kind of sustained bombast coming from the Republican side.\n\n\u201cThe DNC should be much more active and vigorous than they have been. It should have been and should now be more even more forceful in its condemnation of Trump,\u201d said Don Fowler, a former DNC chair, who stressed he wasn\u2019t criticizing the party\u2019s current chair, Tom Perez. \u201cThey should consider at least putting out a statement pointing out that Biden has served with honor, has done nothing improper, illegal or unethical and that his record on these kinds of matters is essentially spotless and that Donald Trump is just a lying no-good son of a bitch.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
