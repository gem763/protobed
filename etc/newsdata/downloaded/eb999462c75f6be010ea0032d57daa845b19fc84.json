Franklin Graham, the president of the evangelical humanitarian organization Samaritan\u2019s Purse and the son of the late evangelist Billy Graham, told The Hill.\n\nFirm support from religious conservatives has been a surprising hallmark since Trump\u2019s success in the 2016 GOP presidential primary.\n\nEvangelicals have stuck with Trump through controversy after controversy, from the payouts for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels\u2019s silence about an alleged affair to the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which Trump was heard bragging about grabbing women by the genitalia.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand every decision he makes, but I\u2019m not in the room. ... I just have to trust and believe that he\u2019s made the right decision on behalf of the American people,\u201d Graham said of his support for Trump after the Syria move.\n\nEvangelicals have been a steady bulwark for the president even when GOP lawmakers have wavered in their support, making it more difficult for most of those lawmakers to think of a more serious break with Trump.\n\nThey have also helped keep Trump\u2019s approval ratings from ever falling too low, particularly among the GOP base.\n\nTrump\u2019s job performance averages about a 40 percent approval rating among the American public but is 80 percent with Republicans.\n\nSupport among evangelicals for Trump has remained consistently high over his three-year presidency.\n\nIn a poll conducted between August and September by the Public Religion Research Institute \u2014 a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institute on politics, religion and culture \u2014 about 77 percent of evangelicals approve of the president\u2019s job performance, while 63 percent said the president has \u201cnot damaged the dignity of the office.\u201d More than 80 percent support him as the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe support from evangelicals after Trump left the Kurds alone to fight Turkey is significant given the group\u2019s support for the Kurds.\n\nEvangelicals hold up the Kurds as heroes in the fight against ISIS and protectors of minority ethnic groups, particularly for Christians with a history in the Middle East that goes back 2,000 years.\n\nThey also condemn Turkey as being untrustworthy and a human rights abuser. This month marked the first anniversary of the freeing of Andrew Brunson, an evangelical pastor who was imprisoned in Turkey for more than two years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a whole lot of trust in what Turkey says,\u201d said Graham, who leads an organization that is increasing operations to help hundreds of thousands of people displaced in northeastern Syria.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust them, don\u2019t believe them. I would encourage people to pray,\u201d Graham said of Turkey. \u201cThis is a very volatile situation.\u201d\n\nThe release of Brunson is a hallmark of Trump\u2019s commitment to evangelicals, and his domestic agenda further cements their support.\n\nEvangelicals praise Trump for filling federal benches with conservative judges and a commitment to protecting freedom of religious expression, particularly in the issues related to restricting federal money for abortion and rolling back rights for the LGBT community. Evangelicals feel little pressure to abandon the president.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he made the decision to remove American troops from Syria is not a deal-breaker for the evangelical community, not even a little,\u201d said Mark Burns, a conservative evangelical pastor and founder of a Christian television network.\n\n\u201cAs the Democratic Party has moved more and more to the left, and that is essentially cutting out some of our religious freedoms, that was the biggest reason the evangelical community supported him,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThis president has clearly been a friend to the evangelical community.\u201d\n\nTrump reveled in that support last week, speaking at the Values Voter summit in Washington, D.C., a conference organized by the Family Research Council.", "description": "U.S. evangelical and Christian groups are standing behind President Trump despite their opposition to his decision to withdraw U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
