Donors and officials from the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank are due to attend, but no Venezuelan representatives.\n\nThe United Nations said Wednesday that a humanitarian response plan of $739 million that was set up this year to help out with the Venezuelan crisis is expected to nearly double for 2020.

Peru has opened its doors to at least 900,000 Venezuelans\n\n'This is the most severe and fastest-growing refugee migrant crisis in Latin American history, at least recent history,' said Walter Stephens, EU ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva.\n\n'There are estimates also that it could further increase if the situation does not change, quickly reaching 5 million.'\n\nColombia is the top destination for Venezuelan migrants fleeing the long-running crisis, which has caused widespread shortages of food and medicine. Some 1.4 million Venezuelans live in Colombia. Peru has opened its doors to at least 900,000 refugees from the neighboring country.\n\nThe flow is overwhelming the financial and administrative capacities of host countries to provide education and health services, Stein said.\n\n'Nine receiving countries have agreed to accept expired (Venezuelan) passports as valid documents. And so with an expired passport you can get a temporary permit sometimes for two years,' he said.\n\nVenezuelan anti-government protesters (pictured on January 23, 2019) hold their national flag as they block traffic during a demonstration in Sao Paulo, Brazil", "description": "The U.N. said Wednesday that the exodus of Venezuelans could reach 5 million people as they continue to flee the oil-rich country that has crashed due to a crippling economy and high inflation.", "authors": ["Adry Torres For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20085668-0-image-a-11_1571839216032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
