I feel for him and his family. I hope there will be a resolution for them. This tragedy shows that a moment\u2019s inattention can have devastating and life-changing consequences'.\n\nStaff Sergeant Hunter Davis died in a head-on crash near his Suffolk airbase after sending text while driving in 2016.

If you are focussed on something else, tired, it can be easy for a driver used to the other side of the road to drift there. The tragedy is that every now and again it happens'.\n\nAnne Sacoolas allegedly hit 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn with her Volvo SUV outside a US spy station in Northamptonshire after driving on the wrong side of the road for up to 400 yards on August 27.\n\nDays later she was spirited from UK soil on a state-sponsored private jet from RAF Mildenhall, protected by her husband Jonathan's diplomatic immunity.\n\nMailOnline has uncovered a string of similar cases today.\n\nIn 2007 Julious Hawkins, 25, from RAF Mildenhall, died in a crash with a lorry after travelling 12 miles westbound on the eastbound carriageway of the A14 at 70mph at 3am.\n\nTests after his death revealed he had 'pre-coma' levels of alcohol in his blood.

That collision pushed the Peugeot into the path of a Mazda being driven by Mr Rolfe, who suffered fatal chest and neck injuries.\n\nGriffin denied she was on the wrong side of the road - but admitted she had looked in both directions before beginning her move out of the airbase road but failed to look right for a second time.\n\nThis week Irving Berlin's granddaughter was spared jail after she caused a head-on crash that killed a pensioner while holidaying in Scotland.\n\nAmerican Caroline Emmet, who lives in Paris, was driving on the wrong side of the road when her vehicle smashed into a car in which Elizabeth Henderson, 83, was a passenger.\n\nThe accident happened on the A198 in East Lothian on July 19, 2017. Mrs Henderson died two days later in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.\n\nAt the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday, Lord Glennie deferred sentence until November next year after Emmet agreed to carry out 500 hours of unpaid work in France, where she lives.

That can happen. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. It happens. You have to be careful.'\n\nThe Dunn family called his words 'oafish, insulting and inflammatory'.\n\nNeil Greig, Director at safety charity IAM RoadSmart said: \u201cIt is important that anyone who is driving in a new country takes steps to familiarise themselves with the road conditions and regulations.
