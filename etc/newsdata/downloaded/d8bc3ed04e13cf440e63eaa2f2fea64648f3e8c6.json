The strategy involves the creation of a fake mob, supported by several undercover police operatives, designed to gain the trust of a suspected criminal to the point that he is willing to confess to the head of the gang, also known as \u201cMr. Big.\u201d (Al Haslett is portrayed in CBC's The Detectives in episodes 101 & 206).\n\nThe technique turned out to be so successful that it\u2019s been used in hundreds of cases ever since its creation. Internationally, it\u2019s simply known as the \u201cCanadian technique.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Big isn\u2019t the only method for conducting undercover homicide operations, it is certainly the most well-known. For the most part, these types of operations are shrouded in mystery.\n\nThat\u2019s by design, said Detective Dave Sweet, who spent years working as an undercover operative for the Calgary Police Service.\n\n\u201cMost undercover operators aren\u2019t even told about the type of crime they\u2019re investigating. They might know it\u2019s a murder they\u2019re investigating, but they\u2019re not told anything else about it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the RCMP, undercover homicide operations are widely used in Canada \u2014 because they work. In 75 per cent of cases, the targeted individual is either cleared or charged. with 95 per cent of charges resulting in convictions.\n\nHere are three common misconceptions about undercover homicide operations we can tell you about:\n\nMost undercover operatives have no idea what crime they\u2019re investigating.\n\nFor any undercover homicide investigation, the goal is to obtain a truthful statement from the person of interest as to whether or not they\u2019re involved in a crime. Critics of these operations contend that they elicit false confessions. The best way to avoid a false confession is by obtaining information that could not have been known by anyone other than those familiar with the crime, otherwise known as holdback. So, to maintain the integrity of any confession, investigators running an undercover operation diligently keep all holdback details hidden from the public, from their peers, and even from the other operatives investigating the case with them.\n\n\u201cMost undercover operators aren\u2019t even told about the type of crime they\u2019re investigating,\u201d said Sweet. \u201cThey might know it\u2019s a murder they\u2019re investigating, but they\u2019re not told anything else about it.\u201d\n\nUndercover work is actually safer than regular patrol duty.\n\nWorking undercover is inherently extremely dangerous. Operatives are in regular contact with highly dangerous people, often in seemingly precarious situations. Things can go very wrong, very quickly. So how can it be safer than patrol duty? Because police services take every precaution available to ensure their operatives\u2019 safety at all times.\n\n\u201cWhen I used to operate, there was always a surveillance team watching me,\u201d said Sweet. \u201cBecause it\u2019s real. It\u2019s all out in the street. And then you\u2019re getting robbed or whatever is happening. So, there\u2019s always somebody fairly close by.\u201d\n\nCompare that to patrol officers pulling over a car for a traffic violation. Those officers have no idea who\u2019s in the car, whether they\u2019re brandishing weapons, whether they\u2019re violent offenders or any other number of variables that would be well known to undercover operatives in their assignments. The same can be said for just about any situation a patrol officer walks into. When it comes to policing, the true danger lies in the unknown.\n\nUndercover operations usually start months before any contact is made.\n\nBefore any undercover operation can get going, many factors need to be considered. Are the necessary resources available? Are they worth the potential reward? Does the nature of the crime warrant the effort required to undertake the operation?\n\nEven if everything lines up, it can take months of surveillance to get enough information about the person of interest to finally enact an actual Mr. Big-style sting.\n\n\u201cThat's when the chess match begins,\u201d said Sweet. \u201cIt becomes very important what steps you're taking; understanding what potentially could help you and what won't help you down the road. When you show your cards, when you don\u2019t \u2014 all that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nSweet adds that suspects ideally have no knowledge of the investigation until the day they\u2019re arrested.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s no escaping it. There\u2019s no opportunity to come up with excuses. There\u2019s no opportunity to tamper with evidence,\u201d Sweet said.\n\n\u201cOn the day that I feel the case is its strongest, that\u2019s the day we arrest and there\u2019s no more anything; they just go to jail.\u201d\n\nDave Sweet takes us back to one of his most memorable cases in episode 207 of CBC's The Detectives.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/thedetectives/content/images/DET_207_undercover_lead.jpg"}
