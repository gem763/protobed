Last Saturday, parliament blocked the government from holding a vote on the deal he clinched with Brussels, making him legally obliged to request the extension.\n\nNo. 10 believes MPs will continue to delay unless the threat of a deadline looms. \u201cUnless there is a line in the sand, this parliament continues to vote to kick the can,\u201d a senior government figure explained on Thursday night, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut MPs could \u2014 of course \u2014 reject the deadline altogether, with a two-thirds majority needed for it to pass. \u201cIf they refuse to vote for the election offer, that is up to them,\" the senior figure said. \"They are going to have to justify to their electorate at some point that they didn\u2019t want to do Brexit.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the government would go into effective hibernation if MPs reject the offer, only acting where necessary to keep the country on its feet.\n\n\u201cIt will be a broken parliament,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe government will pull the bill \u2026 and the offer of a general election is all that will come out of government from now until that general election happens.\u201d\n\nAs an added bonus, Downing Street sees the offer as a triple-win with the public.\n\nMPs can vote the bill through in the extra time, allowing Johnson to head into an election as a champion; they can vote it down in the extra time, allowing Johnson to head into a \u201cpeople vs parliament\u201d election on his Brexit deal; or they can vote against the snap election, adding fuel to the campaign narrative if the public poll ever comes.\n\nAnother unknown is what kind of Brexit delay Brussels will offer, or when they will decide. EU diplomats are set to meet to discuss the extension on Friday, which they are hoping can be agreed without calling another leaders\u2019 summit next week. EU diplomats are set to meet to discuss the extension on Friday, which they are hoping can be agreed without calling another leaders\u2019 summit next week.\n\nCouncil President Donald Tusk has urged EU27 leaders to approve an extension until January 31, as requested by Johnson's letter, a move designed to allow events to continue to shift in Westminster without ensnaring the EU in Britain\u2019s internal politics.\n\nTo that end, the EU27 could just propose a three-month extension on Friday. However, after their last meeting diplomats said France was pushing for a shorter extension, in the hope of pushing the U.K. toward the exit after more than three years of dilly-dallying.\n\nBrussels could also wait until next week \u2014 theoretically they could go quite close to the current October 31 deadline \u2014 to get a clearer sense of the U.K.\u2019s plans. Such a delay could make the opposition less likely to back an election because they first want a guarantee that an extension has been granted.\n\nOpposition opposed\n\nOpposition parties appeared unimpressed with Johnson\u2019s offer of more time with strings attached.\n\nCorbyn previously said Labour would back an election once a Brexit extension is secured, to avoid the risk of falling out of the EU with no deal in the middle of the campaign. But on Thursday night he left himself a lot more wiggle-room.\n\n\u201cTomorrow the European Union will decide whether there\u2019s going to be an extension granted or not,\" he said in a TV clip after meetings with shadow Cabinet members. \"That extension will obviously encompass whether there\u2019s a no deal or not. Let\u2019s find that out tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe news that Johnson had publicly admitted Britain will no longer leave the EU on October 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d was entirely subsumed by the debate about the election.\n\nAsked whether voters might be confused about Labour's stance, he insisted: \u201cThere\u2019s no confusion at all.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Labour leader might be reluctant to face the country while his party is tanking in the polls, and many of his pro-EU MPs agree.\n\nWalthamstow MP Stella Creasy told POLITICO the public should \"see straight through\" the offer from Johnson. \"I am not going to vote to inflict the potential of no deal on my constituents until I know that that is absolutely off the table, as much as I want to get rid of this government,\" she said.\n\nWolverhampton MP Pat McFadden added: \"The way to deal with this is to decide on Brexit first and then consider an election after that.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson made similar noises. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats will not support any election until it is clear that we can avoid crashing out with no deal, and that needs an extension from the EU,\u201d she said.\n\nOther smaller parties refused even to speak in code. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said a general election \u201cwill not resolve Brexit, and it must not happen until no-deal is properly secured and until people have had a final say.\u201d\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price also rejected the offer. \u201cOur priority remains delivering a final say referendum, rather than an election, as the clearest way to end the Brexit chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nBad news (and good news) buried\n\nThe news that Johnson had publicly admitted Britain will no longer leave the EU on October 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d was entirely subsumed by the debate about the election \u2014 another win for No. 10. \"The vote on Tuesday was parliament's last chance to get Brexit done before October 31 and it voted, again, for delay,\u201d Johnson wrote to Corbyn.\n\nAlso subsumed was the vote on the queen\u2019s speech \u2014 the government\u2019s legislative agenda \u2014 which it managed to win after weeks of expectation that it would be voted down.\n\nThe really bad news for MPs, as well as campaigners, is that they could be trudging the streets and knocking on doors during the cold December months. One journalist pointed out that sunset in Glasgow comes before 4 p.m. in the depths of December.\n\nAnd MPs will not have been cheered by a new survey showing a majority of voters on both sides of the Brexit debate believe violence against them is a \u201cprice worth paying\u201d for their preferred outcome.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
