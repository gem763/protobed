He too went to court recently claiming that he had every right to send the trolls populating his Twitter replies packing via the block feature. Twitter is a private entity, is it not? The blocked trolls can still see Trump\u2019s tweets by logging out of their accounts and viewing his publicly available Twitter account homepage, can they not? Well, then, how the hell are anyone\u2019s First Amendment rights being violated by blocking them?\n\nHe made that case to the Second Circuit \u2014 and lost, just last month. AOC will lose too if she\u2019s stupid or stubborn enough to force a lawsuit about it.\n\nThis dispute started with a letter sent to her by Columbia University\u2019s Knight First Amendment Institute, the same outfit that beat Trump in court. Maybe you haven\u2019t heard, said the Institute, but it\u2019s now the law that politicians who use their Twitter accounts to engage extensively on official/policy matters are operating a \u201cpublic forum.\u201d And public forums are covered by the First Amendment, which means you\u2019re not allowed to discriminate against people based on their viewpoint. No blocking allowed.\n\nUntil now, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s pitifully lame defense has been that the AOC Twitter account which five million people follow isn\u2019t her \u201cofficial\u201d account. The official account is RepAOC \u2014 which has all of 188,000 followers or so and is updated infrequently. That\u2019s the public forum, she claims. The AOC account she uses every day for political matters various and sundry is a personal account and therefore shouldn\u2019t be subject to First Amendment restrictions. Trump made the same argument to the Second Circuit, though, and they laughed him off. Right, he has an official POTUS Twitter account in addition to the realDonaldTrump account that the entire world reads, but he can\u2019t duck the reality that he\u2019s running a public forum on his main account simply by designating some other, less newsworthy account his official one. We have to look at how an account is being used to decide if it\u2019s a public forum, said the Second Circuit:\n\nVirtually all of that is true for Ocasio-Cortez and her AOC account. She operates it personally, her staff has claimed, and her Twitter bio makes clear that it belongs to a federal legislator: \u201cCongresswoman for NY-14 (the Bronx & Queens).\u201d The account is her main conduit for communicating with the public about congressional business, including votes on particular bills. And she too uses \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cretweets\u201d copiously to signal agreement with the political opinions of others. The only potentially meaningful difference between Trump\u2019s account and hers is that his staff have acknowledged that he conducts \u201cofficial\u201d business from the account, but that difference may be due more to a distinction in their offices than in how they\u2019re using the platform. Trump can act unilaterally as executive; Ocasio-Cortez, a legislator, can\u2019t. But by using her account to build public support for and against specific bills, she\u2019s also performing a quasi-official duty of her job through her account.\n\nBottom line: She\u2019s going to lose in court if this ends up there and anyone who\u2019s read the Second Circuit opinion would know that. So \u2026 why is she insisting on fighting the Knight Institute on this?\n\n1. I have 5.2 million followers. Less than 20 accounts are blocked for ongoing harassment. 0 are my constituents. 2. Harassment is not a viewpoint. Some accounts, like the Daily Caller, posted fake nude photos of me & abused my comments to spread it. No one is entitled to abuse. https://t.co/0QWKqJFzRe \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 29, 2019\n\nPeople are free to speak whatever classist, racist, false, misogynistic, bigoted comments they\u2019d like. They do not have the right to force others to endure their harassment and abuse. \u270c\ud83c\udffd \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 29, 2019\n\nThe idea that \u201charassment is not a viewpoint\u201d for First Amendment purposes is reminiscent of some progressives\u2019 mistaken belief that \u201chate speech isn\u2019t free speech.\u201d Extreme forms of harassment, like true threats, aren\u2019t protected speech. Petty forms, like tweeting at AOC that she\u2019s a dimwitted commie symp, are. \u201cHarassment\u201d is a bro-o-ad term; doubtless Trump would dub every unflattering comment about him as \u201charassment\u201d if he thought he could use that as a First Amendment workaround. If Ocasio-Cortez believes that certain nasty tweets at her rise to the level of criminal harassment, she should report them to the FBI. Otherwise, what\u2019s left to say?\n\nThe punchline here is that if you know anything about Twitter you know that AOC can easily achieve her goal of tuning out trolls without blocking anyone. That\u2019s what the \u201cmute\u201d function is for. Simply by muting instead of blocking, she can instantly exclude all tweets from a trollish user from her \u201creplies\u201d column while ensuring that that user can continue to see and interact with her own tweets, which is what the Second Circuit was worried about in Trump\u2019s case. She\u2019s supposed to be the most savvy social-media user in all of government. How is it that she doesn\u2019t understand that this simple solution is available to her?
