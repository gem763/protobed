Erdo\u011fan would have to take care of ISIS and manage international condemnation, trouble from Capitol Hill, and the quagmire with the Kurds. And when Trump put it in such stark terms to Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish leader would demur. Until last Sunday, that is, when he told Trump he was moving ahead with the invasion of northern Syria.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jonathan Swan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
