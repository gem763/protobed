It also detected previously missed mutations that could helped doctors hone treatments for individual patients\n\nJohn McCain was diagnosed with glioblastoma - a the most common and deadliest form of brain cancer in adults - in July 2017.\n\nBy August 25 of the following year, the Senator and former presidential candidate had died.\n\nThe average survival time from diagnosis is only 15 to 16 months - and for many patients, it's much shorter.\n\nOne of the reasons that glioblastoma is so deadly so quickly is that it's difficult to treat.\n\nAnd glioblastoma is difficult for several reasons.\n\nFor one, glioblastoma tumors contain multitudes. Various parts of the disease have very different profiles and are fueled by different genetic mutations, so a treatment that keeps the growth of one portion of the tumor at bay may do nothing for another part - or several parts.\n\nThe disease is often already in its later stages by the time it's diagnosed and scans of the brain are not particularly good ways of tracking how the disease is spreading and growing.\n\nThe result is that doctors don't know exactly what to look for or where to look for it and the cancer is often a step or several ahead of their tracking and treatments.\n\nAmanda Johnson was just 30 years old when doctors gave her 16 months to live.\n\nIf she hadn't been rushed into surgery at the University of California, Irvine, to remove the massive tumor from her brain, Amanda's survival time might not have been more than a couple of days, her father, Larry told Fox.\n\nEven after the operation bought Amanda a little bit of time, her family was devastated by the grim prognosis they received, and the unknowns of her disease are anxiety provoking, to say the least.\n\nBut the new blood test could help answer some of those questions and give doctors the tools to tailor treatments to each patient.\n\nThe research team compared tissue and blood - or liquid - biopsies taken from 42 glioblastoma patients to see what signs might be consistent in the two diagnostic measures and how they might predict survival times.\n\nThe 28 patients who had a lower concentration of cfDNA in their blood before surgery survived an average of 9.5 months without their cancers progressing.\n\nBut patients with higher levels of the DNA fragments lived an average of just 4.9 months from when their blood samples were taken.\n\nDr Daniela Bota (left) at UC Irvine recruited Amanda Johnson (right), 30, among 700 glioblastoma patients, to get an experimental drug to target the tumor's stem cells. As scientists learn more about the DNA mutations driving the brain cancer, treatments improve\n\nWhen the study authors further analyzed the blood of 20 of their patients, they found that more than half (11) of them had signs in their blood of at least one genetic mutation that could be driving the cancer that hadn't been detectable in the tissue biopsies.\n\n'If liquid biopsy can give us a more comprehensive view of the molecular profile of the tumor, we can potentially pick more effective combinations for each patient,' said Dr Stephen Bagley, lead study author and a professor at Penn.\n\n'If our findings are validated by further studies, it would mean that these patients may be able to get a simple blood test that would give us a more accurate assessment than imaging of whether their disease has progressed or not, as well as more data on the mutations in their tumors.'\n\nFor the time being, glioblastoma patients are blasted with aggressive radiation and chemotherapy and often have as much of their tumors surgically removed as possible.\n\nGetting treatment better specified for glioblastoma means racing to get into clinical trials for most patients, including Amanda.\n\nHer family's frantic research brought Amanda to the UCI's Dr Daniela Bota and her 700-person clinical trial for adult patients to undergo treatment with a drug called Marizomib.\n\nThe drug travels into the brain and attacks the stem cells that give rise to the tumor cells.\n\nAfter two years of getting infusions of Marizomib three times a month, Amanda's tumor has shrunken so much visual scans can't measure it.\n\nAlthough its too soon for Dr Bota to use the blood test that the Penn researchers developed, it might someday allow an additional way to verify that Amanda, now 30, is at a lower risk of the cancer coming back, and even help tailor treatment to patients like her.", "description": "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that glioblastoma patients with higher levels of a biomarker in their blood lived on average half as long after diagnosis and discovered new mutations.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/15/20377664-0-image-a-3_1572448745186.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
