Or Netflix\u2019s Ryan Murphy. Welcome to the moment in which a powerful showrunner and producer gets even more freedom to try things, to get weird, to say \u201cto hell with it\u201d and have Gwyneth Paltrow garden in a full-skirted gown, because why not? (That is not a complaint.) It\u2019s not as if Murphy\u2019s shows for FX have been tame or conservative; pick almost any scene from any episode of any season of American Horror Story, and ye shall find something bonkers. But it\u2019s hard not to imagine that in the streaming world, especially given the deal that brought him there, Murphy won\u2019t have access to more of almost everything. More money, more time, more liberty. And more people who say, \u201cYes, that totally works, that\u2019s brilliant,\u201d even when it isn\u2019t.\n\nSo here\u2019s the pilot of The Politician, and some of the hypothetical people in Murphy\u2019s corner \u2014 his McAfee, James, and Alice, if you will \u2014 were right when they said yes. And some were wrong. Maybe that\u2019s an unfair comparison. After all, when Payton Hobart (played with staggering energy, vulnerability, and what can only described as gusto by Ben Platt) gets absolutely crushed in a presidential debate, they give it to him straight: It was bad. Very bad. Maybe his answers were perfect, but he got creamed, because there\u2019s no beating authenticity. Authenticity, sincerity, honesty, call it what you want \u2014 it not only wins people over, it also tends to reveal its lack in others. And as Payton\u2019s equally disastrous Harvard admissions interview makes clear, he doesn\u2019t do \u201cauthentic\u201d well.\n\nThere\u2019s the single most interesting thing about The Politician so far: Payton Hobart is startlingly vulnerable, and what he\u2019s turned that into is inauthenticity. Just as those beautiful opening credits illustrate, he\u2019s shoving out the real person to make room for a perfect, precise collection of experiences, skills, achievements, and images, all because a \u201cwaking dream\u201d made clear to him that his destiny was the presidency of the United States. He is, without a doubt, the most Paris Geller\u2013esque character to grace our screens since Liza Weil kicked that door shut in the Gilmore Girls revival. (Now taking bets on whether Payton pulls a kick like that by season\u2019s end.)\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about that debate, and about Platt\u2019s performance in general, is that for Payton, the person he\u2019s trying to dissolve and the one he\u2019s trying to build are both present and in constant conflict. When River (David Corenswet) impulsively tells the school about a failed suicide attempt, it\u2019s the dissolving Payton who reacts. Maybe the strategic part of his mind is still whirring quietly, just a little, but this is a person he\u2019s connected to \u2014 a person we later learn he loves. But he also watches him walk into the audience with alarm, and he starts to sweat, and when he\u2019s asked for his closing statement, he just kind of moves his face. (It doesn\u2019t totally work; Ben Platt is so good in this, but maybe facial-tic comedy isn\u2019t his thing.)\n\nRiver has two selves too, it seems, although it\u2019s not the same. He is himself and the person everyone else imagines him to be. That includes his girlfriend, Astrid, played by Sing Street\u2019s Lucy Boynton (don\u2019t you dare call her Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019s Lucy Boynton or I swear to God I will turn this car around). River doesn\u2019t put much work into pretending to be that person, he just happens to be handsome and popular and rich and good at things. Moments after we meet him, he\u2019s holding a gun, and by the episode\u2019s halfway point, he\u2019s used it. (Murphy may not often opt for restraint, but he does here, and it\u2019s the best possible choice.) The person who looks back at Payton in those last moments is just River, not an idea, just a person. It\u2019s the idea that keeps going, and the real River who we see again as the action jumps into the past.\n\nBut The Politician is a comedy, right? That\u2019s what the warning up front says. There are funny moments, and it\u2019s certainly got the rhythm of (an admittedly dark) comedy in places. Payton\u2019s pursuit of a running mate offers several such moments, including Payton getting absolutely savaged on a school bus and the introduction of Infinity (Zoey Deutch) and her grandmother Dusty (eternal Murphy muse Jessica Lange). But when a person obviously craving genuine connection reaches for a gun with the intent to do himself harm in the first moments of a show, it\u2019s hard to let giggles pour out. Luckily, that jump back in time introduces us to Payton\u2019s mother (the only parent or caregiver, other than Dusty, that we meet), Georgina Hobart, who\u2019s played by Gwyneth Paltrow. And Gwyneth Paltrow seems to be playing a parody of Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nShe\u2019s so well cast here! The painting! The soothing voice! The casual use of \u201cstaff!\u201d Just \u2026 staff. Presumably she means the butler, the under-butler, the personal chef, the masseuse, the personal trainer, the trainer\u2019s trainer, the carpet expert, three aerialists, five to seven lawyers depending on the time, a mindful meditation expert who restores antiques on the side, a whole slew of housekeepers, Daisy from Downton Abbey, the family portraitist, and two guys who follow her twin sons around with a briefcase full of NDAs (that\u2019s why the number of lawyers varies). Oh, and a driver. Paltrow\u2019s Georgina is ludicrous but also human, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a division there. Just the person who loves her son, or at the very least, makes an incredibly convincing show of it. And she certainly helps him pursue his destiny, not least by hiring him a Mandarin tutor \u2014 River, who somehow clocks Payton\u2019s dissolving, broken self in seconds.\n\nThe fact that such a scene works at all is an accomplishment. (It also turned me around on Corenswet, who I thought was a bit of a blank slate at first.) But it\u2019s also where The Politician grows even more confusing. Sure, the tone turns on a dime throughout the first episode, but is what we\u2019re seeing in these flashbacks real? Can River understand Payton instantly? Can he reduce him to tears in moments? Is Astrid the world\u2019s most accomplished library-teleporter? The people are heightened throughout. Just look at Alice, a Jackie O.\u2013Rachel Berry hybrid with a voice like a hypnotist and a haircut she presumably ran by a focus group full of compulsive liars. So is the world they inhabit, which Murphy shoots like Wes Anderson filming a season of Real Housewives. And sure, the election is ludicrous, but there\u2019s nothing to indicate that it isn\u2019t really happening to Payton. Yet the flashbacks are a step beyond.\n\nIn the present, Payton finds himself suddenly the only candidate in the race, though one still without a running mate, since Infinity keeps turning him down for reasons she\u2019s not compelled to explain. He gives a speech \u2014 probably genuine, probably also calculated \u2014 at a memorial for River, then sings Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cRiver,\u201d and I\u2019d call it a shameless opportunity to get Ben Platt to sing if it wasn\u2019t so affecting. (Pick a weeping student from the audience for yourself, I\u2019m McAfee, swallowing her own mouth in the attempt to avoid howling.) Astrid\u2019s crying too, and then she\u2019s not crying; this episode can really be summed up by her silently weeping and shaking, then walking on stage to dab at one nonexistent tear.\n\nThat\u2019s the tear that changed an election. Alice falls on her sword, opening herself up to a torrent of abuse by telling everyone (via social media, of course) that she cheated on Payton and had to break up with him \u2014 lies, as far as we know. Payton presumably changes the dynamic of his whole team by breaking the rules she lays out at the earliest possible moment, an act so unexpected that it\u2019s the one I\u2019ve kept turning over and over in my head since first watching this hour. And Payton\u2019s desperation drives him to once again court Infinity, whose angry refusal pushes him off of grief\u2019s cliffs. He\u2019s using them. He\u2019s seducing them. He\u2019s fake, fake, fake.\n\nShe\u2019s right, he replies, something he tried to confess to his mother earlier. He\u2019s fake, but Infinity is real, and so was River, and then he shatters. That\u2019s the other contrast that this episode hinges on. That devastation is real. But so is his composed walk to the car, and his simple declaration that Infinity is onboard.\n\nExcept maybe she\u2019s faking it, too.\n\nTalking points\n\n\u2022 When I first watched this episode, my viewing buddy guessed that Payton and River\u2019s connection would be that they were brothers. I said no, if they were brothers they\u2019d be hot twins. Then the hot twins showed up. Someone send me a medal.\n\n\u2022 Here\u2019s hoping that, in the world of The Politician, someone caught Dusty glaring at the black family in the restaurant and has already christened her \u201cBuffet Betty\u201d or something like that on Twitter.\n\n\u2022 Which came first, the name River or the choice of song? I am, to be quite honest, guessing the latter.\n\n\u2022 As with every Murphy-Falchuk show (this one Murphy, Falchuk, and Glee collaborator Ian Brennan), the costumes and production design are exquisite. So let\u2019s do a best costume of the episode pick throughout: Obviously, the gardening gown, though I covet each and every thing that McAfee (Laura Dreyfuss) wears.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWell, your father and I bought their way in.\u201d\n\nIn crisis?
