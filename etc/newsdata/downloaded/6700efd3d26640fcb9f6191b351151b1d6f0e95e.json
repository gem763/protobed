Drones have been deployed to search for them. According to NOLA.com, no one on the street sustained injuries.\n\nThe building's upper six to eight floors collapsed and the remainder of the building was very unstable, New Orleans Fire Department Superintendent Tim McConnell said during a news conference earlier in the day.\n\n\"It's still a very dangerous situation,\" he told Fox News. \"The crane is still in place but it is unsupported and very dangerous. We are in the process of evacuating the buildings in the perimeter.\"\n\nBuildings in a square made up of Bienville Street, Basin Street, Canal Street and Burgundy were evacuated. Saturday's performances of Wicker at the Saenger Theatre, across the street from the hotel, was also cancelled.\n\nJUST IN via @nolaready: The @NOLAFireDept is evacuating buildings in the red zone by the Uptown side of Bienville, River side of Basin, Downtown Side of Canal and Lake side of Burgundy. If you are in this area, evacuate now!

Like an airplane maybe. It drew my head immediately.\"\n\nOne person was killed and at least 18 were injured after the under construction Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans collapsed, authorities said pic.twitter.com/6B7m7hi8tU \u2014 Reuters Top News (@Reuters) October 12, 2019\n\nHere's a look at the collapse:\n\nHard Rock Hotel New Orleans under construction collapses; multiple injuries reported\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/lN8dRaw7Af \u2014 Breaking911 (@Breaking911) October 12, 2019\n\nNew video.
