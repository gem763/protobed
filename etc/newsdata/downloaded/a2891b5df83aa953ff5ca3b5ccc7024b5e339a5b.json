Neither the phone nor prosecutors provided evidence of a kidnapped brother or any brother in ISIS.\n\nA judge ruled Mr. Alani should be held without bond as his Iraqi brother makes him a flight risk.\n\nWhile he hasn\u2019t been given a terrorism-related charge, Mr. Alani was charged in September for willfully damaging, destroyng, disabling or wrecking an \u201cair data module\u201d on an American Airlines flight.\n\nCourt documents accuse Mr. Alani of taking foam and supergluing it to a system monitoring speed and other data, leading to an error in the plane\u2019s system and forcing the pilots to cancel a flight from Miami to the Bahamas. The affidavit says he tampered with the system to receive overtime pay.\n\nMr. Alani\u2019s public defender said he knew his sabotage would lead to the flight\u2019s cancellation, and even if it hadn\u2019t, other safety features would have kept the plane in the air.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think they are going to be able to prove he intentionally put people in danger,\u201d attorney Christian Dunham said, according to NBC News. \u201cThe plane would have been fine to fly.\u201d\n\nMr. Alani is expected to enter in a plea on Friday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
