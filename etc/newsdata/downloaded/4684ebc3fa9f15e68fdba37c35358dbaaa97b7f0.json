In the 1850s the area\u2019s first settlers arrived from the East Coast and established a community on the property that they named after a British governor of Virginia, Lord Fincastle.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in a little over 50 years that the ranch has been available for sale. The estate of Ivy Miller sold off the 1,300-plus-acre property to a private Dallas-based family in the late 1960s, following the gangster\u2019s death, property records show.\n\nThe main house has been added onto in the years since and today spans several-thousand square feet, Mr. Uechtritz said. The home features rustic Adirondack-style architecture, with vaulted ceilings, an ornamental stone fireplace and wood paneling, images of the home show. The airy living spaces act like a \u201ccommunal lodge\u201d with bedrooms off each end of the house, according to the listing agent.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nToo small for cattle ranching, the farm has served for decades as a hobby farm and a weekend home, he added. The forested grounds, lakes and rivers on the ranch are suited to recreational hunting and fishing.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for families to part with modest-sized farms like Fincastle, which tend to be passed down through families, according to the agent, who said they\u2019ve already had some interest in the property since it listed publicly last week.\n\nThe next owner will have to choose whether to keep and restore the old gangster gambling den, which occupies a scenic spot overlooking Fincastle Lake, or raze the historic property and build something new.\n\n\u201cI think it could go either way,\u201d Mr. Uechtritz said. \u201cIf you have someone who\u2019s really interested in having a talking piece, they may opt to save it.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MANSION GLOBAL", "description": "A lush Texas farm with ties to some of the state\u2019s most notorious gangsters has hit the market asking nearly $12 million.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/im-109940.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
