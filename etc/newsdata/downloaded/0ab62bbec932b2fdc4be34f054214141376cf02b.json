I will be raising it myself with the White House.\"\n\n\u201cI hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country,\" he said earlier this month.", "description": "The Trump administration will be sued by a British family over the death of their son in an automobile accident thought to have been caused by the wife of an American diplomat who claimed diplomatic immunity and fled to the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_102519upi_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
