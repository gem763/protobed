Around 10,000 people swarmed the streets of the city on Saturday night, clashing with riot police, who responded with batons and rubber bullets. An earlier demonstration, drawing 350,000 people, had passed peacefully.\n\nCatalonians opposed to independence marched on Sunday, waving the Spanish flag and calling for national unity.\n\nPolice say 80,000 people showed up, a fraction of the number that pro-independence protests have drawn over the last two weeks.\n\nHowever, Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million people remain divided on the region\u2019s future, with roughly half supporting secession and half opposed. The pro-independence side remain angered at the Spanish government\u2019s crackdown on the 2017 referendum, which saw police raiding polling stations, beating voters, and seizing ballot boxes.\n\nLike this story?
