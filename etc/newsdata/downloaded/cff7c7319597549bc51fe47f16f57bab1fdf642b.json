Trump refers to Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky as \u2018new Russian president\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Donald Trump has galvanized Russiagate diehards lurking on social media, after mistakenly referring to Volodymyr Zelensky as the new leader of\u2026 Russia.\n\nThe US president made the slip-up while defending his relationship with Kiev, which is currently being scrutinized by Democratic lawmakers. The impeachment inquiry is trying to determine if Trump tried to pressure Zelensky to open an investigation into the son of Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nTrump told reporters on Monday that the accusations were based on a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d of a phone conversation he had with the Ukrainian president \u2013 adding that Zelensky himself had confirmed that nothing untoward had occurred.\n\n\u201cThe Russian, as you know, the new Russian president, a good man, made a statement. There was no anything. There was no pressure put on him. No anything,\u201d Trump said, mixing up Zelensky\u2019s country of origin.\n\nThe error delighted devout disciples of the now-debunked conspiracy theory that Trump was (or still is) somehow in cahoots with the Kremlin.\n\nIn a similarly hot take, the Washington Post\u2019s Moscow correspondent described the error as \u201cthe biggest insult one could throw at the leader of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump just called Zelensky the \u201cnew Russian president\u201d. Probably the biggest insult one could throw at the leader of #Ukraine. https://t.co/GBfuc3F3vK \u2014 Amie Ferris-Rotman (@Amie_FR) October 28, 2019\n\nBut people probably shouldn\u2019t read too deep into the mix-up. Trump has a well-documented history of geographical blunders. In August, the president misstated the location of a mass shooting during a press conference to commemorate the tragic event, mistakenly referring to the city of Toledo, instead of Dayton, Ohio.\n\nAlso on rt.com Only person who can pressure me is my 6yo son, not Trump, says Zelensky\n\nLike this story?
