Tonga's Malietoa Hingano scores their second try REUTERS/Annegret Hilse\n\nPiutau, who was celebrating his 34th birthday in his 43rd and final test at his third World Cup, scored a try and kicked the last conversion at Hanazono Rugby Stadium as the Tongans finished off their tournament in style.\n\nTongan prop Siegfried Fisi\u2019ihoi opened the scoring and centre Malietoa Hingano crossed to give the Pacific islanders the lead around the hour mark, with fullback Telusa Veainu adding the fourth try after the final gong.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking all week about playing well and finishing on a high,\u201d said Piutau, who was named man of the match.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some adversity but hopefully we\u2019ve come up with a performance that made our people proud. We came with a mindset to leave it all out there, leave no stones unturned and I think we did that today.\u201d\n\nReplacement Mike Te\u2019o had scored two tries with his first two touches in four first-half minutes to give the United States a 12-7 halftime lead and flanker Tony Lamborn added a try two minutes from time, but the Americans will go home winless.\n\nFor much of the 80 minutes it was easy to remember that these were two teams that had failed to secure a victory between them in six previous matches, albeit in a tough Pool C that also include England, France and Argentina.\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s silence to remember those affected by Typhoon Hagibis, which ripped through the Tokyo area overnight, the Tongans looked desperate to make the quick start that had eluded them in their previous matches.\n\nA combination of poor choices in attack kept them off the scoresheet until the 17th minute when winger Viliami Lolohea shoved aside a couple of tacklers for a 40-metre break and Fisi\u2019ihoi forced his way over the line.\n\nTwo minutes later Eagles skipper Blaine Scully was forced off injured and replaced by Te\u2019o, who plays scrumhalf, winger and fullback but has the build of a prop.\n\nDOLAN OFFLOAD\n\nThe Californian had immediate impact on the right wing, taking a sublime one-handed offload from number eight Cam Dolan to score his first try before adding a second from a similar position after a lofted pass from fullback Will Hooley.\n\nThe Tongans came out firing in the second half to try and reel in the Eagles but more poor decision-making saw them waste overlap after overlap.\n\nSonatane Takulua took a shot at goal to cut the deficit to three points in the 51st minute and Hingano got the Tongans back in front when a hack through from a turnover found no one at home in the U.S. defence seven minutes later.\n\nPiutau found a gap in the same defence to slide through and score his try four minutes later but the Americans have always shown plenty of fight in this tournament and they got some reward in 78th minute.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nThe Eagles pack forced their way to the line and Lamborn touched the ball against the base of the post for a try that gave them hopes of unlikely victory, only for the Tongans to score again through Veainu.\n\n\u201cOur mentality and our mindset is to stay in games until the last minute,\u201d said Scully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just small margins but that\u2019s test rugby, that\u2019s World Cup rugby. It\u2019s been a phenomenal tournament.\u201d", "description": "Tonga gave captain Siale Piutau the parting gift of a first victory of the Rugby World Cup with a 31-19 win over the United States on Sunday that left the Eagles pointless at the end of their campaign.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440309327&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C079", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
