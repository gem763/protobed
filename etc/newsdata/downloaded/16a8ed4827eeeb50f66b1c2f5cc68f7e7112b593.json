Throw in the almost universally acknowledged continued levels of heightened uncertainty on the political front, with markedly divergent Brexit paths still possible and it is actually pretty shocking that a comment that a rate cut is \u201cquite plausible\u201d has caused such a response.", "description": "Forex Analysis by XTB (David Cheetham) covering: GBP/USD.
