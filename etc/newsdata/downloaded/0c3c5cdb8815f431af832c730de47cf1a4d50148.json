Even so, the move is shabby politics, a gamble that might well fail, and an eloquent demonstration of the prime minister\u2019s weakness.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson asked Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue the legislature for five weeks before beginning a new session in mid-October, a little over two weeks before the Brexit deadline. This isn\u2019t unprecedented or on the face of it unlawful. It still leaves time for the House of Commons to veto a no-deal Brexit if it can muster a majority for that. But proposed at a moment of national crisis, this suspension will be the longest in decades, and Johnson\u2019s stated reason \u2014 that it\u2019s necessary to introduce a \u201cbold and ambitious\u201d domestic agenda \u2014 is plainly dishonest.\n\nWhat\u2019s the real objective? The prime minister seems to be banking on two possible outcomes.\n\nOne is that he\u2019ll tempt the opposition into calling a no-confidence vote and hence an election. With Labour in complete disarray, and Brexit opponents split on every other matter of public policy, this has a certain strategic appeal. But any such course would threaten only more costly delay and uncertainty over Brexit.\n\nThe second rationale is that the suspension, if it isn\u2019t overturned by the courts, will frustrate efforts to stop Britain from exiting the European Union without a deal come Oct. 31. Preserving the possibility of a no-deal exit is the core of Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy, his main leverage in talks with the EU.\n\nAgain, one can see the strategic sense in this calculation. Again, though, it\u2019s grossly irresponsible. A majority in Parliament has already rejected a no-deal exit. Only about 25% of the public supports it \u2014 indeed, only half of those supporting Brexit agree with it. It would be the worst possible outcome to this whole misbegotten process, leaving the U.K. poorer, weaker and indefinitely adrift.\n\nMore than anything, Johnson has demonstrated the weakness of his own position. He\u2019s an unelected prime minister heading a minority government. With this threadbare legitimacy, he\u2019s facing the most consequential decision a British prime minister has had to make in decades. And his unpopular negotiating position is pointing the country toward calamity. To escape this bind, he\u2019s chosen tactical maneuvering rather than wise leadership.\n\nJohnson\u2019s supporters think suspending Parliament is a cunning move. It\u2019s better understood as an act of desperation \u2014 and, if this still counts in British politics, an assault on the national interest.\n\n--Editors: Timothy Lavin, Clive Crook\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net, .\n\nEditorials are written by the Bloomberg Opinion editorial board.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com/opinion\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to suspend Parliament is hardly the \u201ccoup\u201d that his more emotional opponents have claimed.
