That's according to Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist of The Leuthold Group, a market research and money management firm that oversees more than $1 billion in assets.\n\nFor anyone considering buying tech stocks, he is flagging a prime opportunity to invest in small-cap companies with market valuations under $1 billion instead of the so-called FANGs that include Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet.\n\nIn his recent note laying out this investment case, he acknowledges that his proposition might be daunting for some investors.\n\nAfter all, large-cap tech stocks have been among the safest bets throughout this historic bull market. They've delivered some of the strongest returns and earnings-growth prospects over the past 10 years.\n\nAdditionally, business spending on tech hardware and software remains strong even as the \"old-era\" manufacturing sector plunges deeper into a recession. And if this trend continues, it's plausible that the largest companies would benefit the most from demand for cutting-edge tech solutions.\n\nRead more: The world's most accurate economic forecaster sees a 'prolonged global slowdown' on the horizon \u2014 and warns it can only be narrowly avoided\n\nBut Paulsen is looking at these value propositions differently \u2014 and his conclusion is that smaller tech stocks could actually be the ones that dominate going forward.\n\nHe observes that they are already taking the lead from the big dogs. The S&P 600 tech index \u2014 which Paulsen dubs the MiniFangs \u2014 has been gradually outpacing the NYSE FANG+ Index after a long stretch of underperformance from late-2016 through June 2019.\n\nIf this trend continues, Leuthold sees small-cap tech stocks gaining more notoriety and inflows from investors.\n\nHe goes beyond pointing out their recent performance to highlight a few other trends that could propel them higher.\n\nSmall-cap stocks are more compelling from a valuation perspective, he says, comparing S&P 600 technology stocks to their S&P 500 counterparts. His geo-weighted index of the forward price-to-earnings multiple, price-t0-book ratio, and price-to-cash-flow ratio for both indexes shows that smaller stocks have been cheapening since the end of 2013.\n\nHe also sees a compelling case to buy small-cap stocks based on their relative volatility. He concluded that S&P 600 tech volatility is a good leading indicator of price performance, based on the 120-day relative volatility of small- and large-cap stocks.\n\nIf you find these quantitative arguments insufficient, Paulsen has one more for you to consider: Smaller tech companies are not facing the same regulatory scrutiny as their larger brethren.\n\n\"Today, when it comes to technology stocks, while big may be beautiful, small may be smart,\" he concluded.\n\nIn terms of individual names, Brooks Automation, Power Integrations, and Itron are among the top-10 firms on the S&P index.\n\nAnd, Invesco's S&P SmallCap Information Technology exchange-traded fund tracks the index it is named after.", "description": "\"MiniFangs\" consist of under-the-radar tech companies that are outperforming stocks like Facebook and Netflix, says Jim Paulsen of The Leuthold Group.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e1699122bd559ae0cfbe3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
