Scared as usual. Sketchy ladder on the way up. But really looking forward to sending this.\n\n'I've waited for all the cars in the car park to leave. Sunset is about to go on. And there's nothing left to do now but boogie on and have a bit of fun.'\n\nHe then makes his way down a narrow set of stairs looking out towards the breathtaking mountain scene ahead of him.\n\nHe says: 'Three, two, one, see ya,' before leaping off the structure.\n\nThe daredevil, from Germany, says: 'Three, two, one, see ya,' before leaping off the structure\n\nHe pulls a cord behind him sending his parachute billowing.\n\nBut, as he comes in to land, he loses his footing and skids along the gravel-covered floor.\n\nWhile smiling, he exclaims: 'That was sketchy! Thanks for watching. Hopefully I'll land better next time.'\n\nAs he comes in to land, he loses his footing and skids along the gravel-covered floor. While smiling, he exclaims: 'That was sketchy!

I slipped on the gravel on the landing but just a couple of scrapes so can't complain.\n\nHe pulls a cord behind him sending his parachute billowing. Stunning views of the Bulgarian mountains can be seen as he glides towards the ground\n\n'The footage was filmed on the Go Pro Fusion 360.
