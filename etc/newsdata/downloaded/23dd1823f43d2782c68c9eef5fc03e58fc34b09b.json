The creators issued a mocking apology on Twitter after the show, which panned Hollywood and U.S. entertainers for tailoring their work to avoid Beijing censors.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping's government banned the show afterward.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Multiple Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Taylor Swift is set to perform in Shanghai next month as a censorship battle between the United States and China seemingly persists targeting the NBA and the satirical adult cartoon show South Park.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Taylor-Swift-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
