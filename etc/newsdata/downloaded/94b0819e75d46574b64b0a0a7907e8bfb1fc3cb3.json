State and federal officials have arranged rescue operations, and people are being made aware of safety procedures.\n\nNot surprisingly, climate-change alarmists are seizing the opportunity to promote unfounded fears.\n\nWriting in Forbes, Laura Tenenbaum declared, \u201cglobal warming causes more intense hurricanes\u201d and suggested that more are on the way. Grist quipped, \u201c\u2018Another hurricane?\u2019 How climate disasters can give us compassion fatigue,\u201d and asserted that \u201cthe scientific consensus is that climate change will contribute to more frequent extreme weather events.\u201d Grist blamed President Donald Trump for being complicit.\n\nThis tactic\u2014seizing the moment to politicize a hurricane and push the climate scare\u2014is not new. The Washington Post did the same during Hurricane Florence\u2019s landfall last year.\n\nIs Dorian a result of \u201cclimate change\u201d? Well, yes, insofar as every hurricane forms due to changes in climatic conditions that bring favorable conditions for a hurricane.\n\nBut that, of course, isn\u2019t what climate alarmists have in mind by \u201cclimate change.\u201d They mean global warming over the past 50 years or so driven to dangerous levels by human emissions of carbon dioxide. This, they claim, is causing more extreme weather events like the recent wildfires in the Amazon and Category 5 hurricanes like Dorian.\n\nBut one need not be a scientist to expose the falsehood of that claim. All one has to do is look up the historic frequency and strength of hurricanes since records began. The data reveal the truth\u2014and here they are.\n\nNo Increase in Hurricane Frequency\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s \u201cU.S. Hurricane Strikes by Decade\u201d data, reaching back to 1851, can be accessed here. They show that there has been a 50 percent reduction in the number of major hurricanes making landfall in the United States since the 1930s. For the entire period, there is a slight downward trend in frequency, but the decline since the 1930s is remarkable.\n\nSo, if anything, hurricanes have become less frequent, not more, during the period of allegedly manmade global warming.\n\nNo Increase in Hurricane Strength\n\nAlthough damage done by hurricanes has risen, the increase is entirely because more people and property are in their paths, not because there are more, or stronger, hurricanes. Hurricane intensity shows no sign of increase in the past 90 years. In fact, there is a slight decrease between 1930 and 2018.\n\nSo the hard data reveal that hurricanes are not increasing in either frequency or intensity. Any claim of scientific consensus otherwise is simply false.\n\nThe mainstream media have been promoting the myth of \u201cscientific consensus on extreme weather events.\u201d Scientists themselves say there is no such consensus.\n\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) special climate report in 2018 finds little to no evidence for the hypothesis that global warming caused extreme weather events to increase.\n\nInstead, it says \u201cthere is only low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global warming over the last four decades.\u201d Even more shocking, it states,\u201cNumerous studies towards and beyond AR5 have reported a decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and/or the globally accumulated cyclonic energy.\u201d\n\nSo instead of creating climate fears and politicizing Hurricane Dorian, the media should stick to warning people of risks and informing them about safety procedures and rescue operations.\n\nVijay Jayaraj (M.Sc., Environmental Science, University of East Anglia, England), Research Contributor for the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, lives in Bengaluru (Bangalore), India.", "description": "As I write at 11 a.m. Eastern Time Monday, Hurricane .09/03/2019 19:42:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Vijay Jayaraj", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/295/3b61ed4f-1e91-4199-8b3f-d7943d894a45.jpg"}
