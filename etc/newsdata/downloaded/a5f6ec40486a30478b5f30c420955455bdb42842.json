Masculine adjectives included \u201cambitious\u201d and \u201chas leadership abilities\u201d; feminine adjectives included \u201cshy\u201d and \u201cchildlike.\u201d\n\nWomen were told to sit cross-legged and not to make face-to-face contact with men at work.\n\nThe presenter claimed women had smaller brains than men, a former EY executive director who wished to remain anonymous told HuffPost. She added that the presentation said women absorbed information \u201clike pancakes,\u201d making it hard for them to focus.\n\nThe presentation also had a breakdown describing differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s speaking styles, saying women ramble and \u201cmiss the point\u201d when they communicate and \u201cthink men hog air time.\u201d\n\nStudies show men interrupt women and dominate workplace conversations: A 2014 study found women interrupted men just once during three-minute conversations, while men averaged 2.6 interruptions of women during those three minutes.\n\nEY did not immediately respond to Business Insider\u2019s request for additional comment.\n\nThe training reportedly occurred in June 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement as women across the US shared stories of sexual harassment at work. EY itself faced two sexual-harassment complaints, while the rival accounting firm Deloitte fired 20 partners for misconduct.\n\nPromoting gender stereotypes at work may also result in excluding nonconforming employees. Half of LGBTQ employees have experienced verbal discrimination at work, and queer people have high rates of workplace sexual harassment.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
