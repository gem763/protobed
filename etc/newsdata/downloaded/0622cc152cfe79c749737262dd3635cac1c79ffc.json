I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. I'm not f***ing leaving!'\n\nIt emerged in August that Disney and Sony were at loggerheads over financing and that if the issue was not resolved, the MCU would lose Spider-Man.\n\nTom remained publicly optimistic, telling Entertainment Weekly: 'Who knows what the future holds? But all I know is that I\u2019m going to continue playing Spider-Man and having the time of my life. It\u2019s going to be so fun, however we choose to do it.'\n\nHe added: 'The future for Spider-Man will be different, but it will be equally as awesome and amazing, and we\u2019ll find new ways to make it even cooler.'\n\nThe rapprochement the studios arrived at this Thursday stipulates that Disney will rake in a fourth of the profits, Variety sources claim.\n\nIn the original deal, Disney got 5% of first-dollar gross. The feud over the summer allegedly sprang from Sony's desire to stick to this arrangement, while Disney wanted to evenly split the financing.\n\nDoing his part: It's thanks to Tom that the two companies were able to come to an agreement, as The Hollywood Reporter claimed he used his role in Sony's new Uncharted film as leverage\n\nDelighted: When a deal was finally made, Tom posted an Instagram clip of Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf Of Wall Street saying 'You know what? I'm not leaving' in celebration\n\nAmy Pascal, who was at Sony until 2015 and was a producer on both Homecoming and Far From Home via her own company, is back for the third film as well.\n\nSony acquired the rights to Spider-Man in the late 1990s and quickly churned out a hit trilogy of live-action movies between 2002 and 2007.\n\nDirected by Sam Raimi, these films starred Leonardo's pal Tobey Maguire as the title superhero and Kirsten Dunst as his love interest Mary Jane Watson.\n\nSony then rebooted the franchise with the 2012 feature The Amazing Spider-Man, starring erstwhile Hollywood hot couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.\n\nIconic: Sony acquired the rights to Spider-Man in the late 1990s and quickly churned out a hit trilogy of live-action movies between 2002 and 2007\n\nTrying again: Sony then rebooted the franchise with the 2012 feature The Amazing Spider-Man, starring erstwhile Hollywood hot couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone\n\nThe 2014 sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a box office disappointment and divided critics, earning a 52% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nPlans for future Spider-Man films at Sony were shelved and the company reached their original deal with Disney, ushering the character into the MCU.\n\nSpider-Man adjacent movies have since begun to crop up at Sony again, including a movie about the villain Venom last year starring Tom Hardy and the forthcoming film Mobius starring Jared Leto.\n\nThe next MCU Spider-Man film is set to be released on July 16, 2021.", "description": "The actor, 23, made the claim during an appearance at\u00a0ACE Comic Con Midwest in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/10/19733408-0-image-a-8_1571132892336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
