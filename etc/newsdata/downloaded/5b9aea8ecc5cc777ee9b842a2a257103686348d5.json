A subsequent step would see him \u201chanding my shares to a foundation, convincing other shareholders to do the same,\u201d he told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.\n\nDe Benedetti, 84, said he envisaged a two- or three-year period in which he would head the foundation, which would include journalists, managers and individuals from the cultural sector.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to assure an independent future for a piece of Italian history,\u201d he said.\n\nSeven years ago he transferred his stake in CIR to his three sons Rodolfo, Marco and Edoardo.\n\nExplaining his bid to buy a stake in GEDI at the weekend, he said his sons had \u201cneither the skills nor the passion required to be publishers\u201d and had concentrated solely on looking for a buyer.\n\nAsked if he planned to increase the offer price, he said the company managed by his sons was worth 25 cents. \u201cWhy should I pay more for it?,\u201d he said.\n\nGEDI closed on Monday at 0.29 cents.", "description": "Carlo De Benedetti, at odds with his three sons over the fate of Italy's GEDI , publisher of the La Repubblica and La Stampa newspapers, plans a two-stage relaunch of the firm including investment in digital, he said in an interview published on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440975098&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E06Q", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
