James Brickwood\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said the only way for banks to get the message was if customers pressed them for a better deal and then voted with their feet if they were not satisfied.\n\nThe Treasurer drew parallels with the energy market where the discounts available for new customers had been capped, but stopped short of endorsing a default market offer-style mechanism for mortgages.\n\n\u201cIn banking, as in energy, customers get penalised for their loyalty. To win new business banks will offer cheaper rates to new customers leaving their existing customers in the cold,\u201d Mr Frydenberg said.\n\nOn Sunday, shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers turned up the heat on the big banks and said Labor would explore options to help the RBA boost competition and to have interest rates passed on in full.\n\nThis included granting the ACCC more powers and increasing the Coalition's controversial bank levy.\n\nThe banks have privately argued it is not practical to offer competitive rates to all customers. Australia's dominant big four banks are losing market share to foreign banks and non-bank lenders that are able to offer more competitive pricing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Australian Banking Association spokesman defended the way the sector priced mortgages and encouraged customers to compare loans.\n\n\u201cAustralia's mortgage market is fiercely competitive, with over 5000 different products available from a wide range of lenders,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWith the market for home loans so competitive, Australian bank customers should contact their bank and shop around.\u201d\n\nThe heightened competition in an environment of slowing housing growth is posing a challenge to the big banks that angered politicians when they chose to pass on just over half of the Reserve Bank's rate cut last week.\n\nThe banks have blamed ultra-low interest rates for a compression in profit margins as a greater share of their deposits pay close to zero interest and therefore cannot be reduced in tandem with lending rates.\n\nBut both Macquarie and Evans & Partners have highlighted the risk of further margin pressure if banks are forced to offer existing customers similar rates to new customers. Macquarie identified a typical discount of a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, for new customers.\n\nEvans & Partners said erosion of this \"back book\" benefit would result in a further decline in net interest margins of between 10 and 18 basis points.\n\nThe analysis was based on an average size of the so-called \"back book\" of existing mortgages representing between 58 and 74 per cent of the big four's loan books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeloitte's mortgage report estimated the benefit the banks receive from this phenomenon was about 50 basis points. An ACCC inquiry estimated the differential to be 32 basis points.\n\nEvans & Partners Matthew Wilson said that \"as interest rates approach zero, mortgage customers will be incentivised to discover price\".\n\n\"Indeed, you would expect mortgage brokers to actively encourage customers to re-finance their mortgage and in doing so meet their 'best interest' duty. Thus, eventually eroding the mortgage back book benefit.\"\n\nRBA governor Philip Lowe has also begun to urge Australians to shop around in search of a lower interest rate. On Friday the central bank said Australia's major banks remained among the most profitable in the world but said those profits had fallen because of increased misconduct charges.\n\nIn its financial stability review, the RBA also said that bank net interest margins had been declining because of \"pricing competition for housing loans and switching from (higher margin) interest only to (lower margin) principal and interest lending\".\n\nMr Sims said there was a disconnect between business and consumers.\n\n\"Business, of course, would say why should I give a lower interest rate to someone who is not asking for it, whereas the consumer says I am being loyal to you and you are taking advantage of that loyalty and are understandably outraged,\" Mr Sims said.\n\n\"What it means for politicians and regulators is they need to encourage customers to not be loyal.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said more competition would help shrink the gap identified in the ACCC's 2018 report.\n\nThe gap between pricing terms for new and existing mortgage customers had some similarities with the energy sector, but also key differences according to Mr Sims.\n\nThe ACCC recommended the government cap offers after energy companies upped the base upon which they discounted offers for new customers.\n\nEnergy companies have since blamed the arrangement for a fall in profits.\n\n\"Those stuck on standing offers were paying ridiculous prices. Eventually the government capped standing offers so if discounts are offered they have to be off the capped standing base,\" Mr Sims said.\n\n\"There\u2019s no regulatory answer I can think of but knowing that gap is there is something we won\u2019t let go of whether it\u2019s in banking or energy.\"", "description": "The banks' shabby treatment of loyal customers has placed the vast profits made by their 'back books' into the spotlight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2383%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_350/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a4e678cedcbd924d772e252d2c18f3f934716d88", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
