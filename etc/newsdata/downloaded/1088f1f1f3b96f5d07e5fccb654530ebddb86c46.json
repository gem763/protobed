It\u2019s not as if the Framers were unwilling to specify any limits on the impeachment power; it\u2019s famously restricted to \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Nor has Yoo\u2019s view been the view traditionally taken by Congress. Various politicos pointed out last night on Twitter after this bit aired on Fox that Andrew Johnson was impeached in February of a presidential election year. Mitch McConnell had precedent to point to when he roadblocked Merrick Garland\u2019s confirmation on grounds that it was an election year and therefore voters should decide which party gets to fill Scalia\u2019s seat. Yoo doesn\u2019t even have that.\n\nBesides, the nature of the impeachment process means that the will of the electorate will naturally be priced into the calculations made by Congress. For reasons of sheer self-preservation, the House won\u2019t proceed with an impeachment which it has reason to believe would be strongly opposed by American voters. They have to face those voters every 24 months, after all. That\u2019s been Pelosi\u2019s fear all along \u2014 that House Democrats would indulge their id by impeaching Trump for flimsy reasons, Senate Republicans would swat them down during a trial, and then a voter backlash to Democratic overreach would lead to Trump being reelected to a second term and the House returned to Republican hands. If the people believe that the House has unfairly usurped their sovereign role in deciding who should lead the executive branch, they\u2019ll deal with them accordingly. Soon.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to imagine worst-case scenarios in which a president would need to be removed immediately for the good of the country. Imagine that Rachel Maddow\u2019s darkest Russiagate fantasy about Trump being a Kremlin-controlled asset had turned out to be true but somehow we didn\u2019t discover it until January 2020. Should Americans be obliged to sit back and let the Kremlin steer U.S. policy for 10 months until the election because it\u2019s somehow \u201ctoo late\u201d to impeach? Absurd.\n\nThe weirdest part of Yoo going this route is that there are much stronger arguments available for defeating an attempt to remove Trump from office. The GOP\u2019s eventually going to settle on the ol\u2019 \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d defense, which in a sense is foolproof. Because \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d is vague, virtually anything short of outright treason can be said to have failed to clear the bar. Smart Republicans like Rob Portman and Lamar Alexander are already maneuvering towards that position:\n\nStmt from @SenAlexander: \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for the president to be talking with foreign governments about investigating his political opponents, but impeachment would be a mistake.\u201d pic.twitter.com/BmxgJhg4hj \u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 10, 2019\n\nTim Miller has a piece out today arguing why \u201cbad but not impeachable\u201d is wrong in this case but his logic works even better to counter Yoo\u2019s argument: You can\u2019t leave it to an election to settle whether the president\u2019s committed an impeachable offense if the offense might affect the election itself. If Trump really was withholding desperately needed military aid from Ukraine until they coughed up dirt on the Democratic frontrunner, Ukrainian leaders might have concluded they had no choice but to provide it. Maybe that would have meant a diligent investigation of Burisma, or maybe it would have meant fabricating something whole cloth to damage Biden and satisfy Trump. If American voters had chosen next fall between Trump and Biden based in part on a fake Biden scandal which Trump himself had helped engineer, in what universe would that be a fair referendum on whether Trump had done something impeachable? Again, it\u2019s absurd.\n\nThe House gets to impeach when it likes and voters get to whack them hard for it if they agree with the president that this was a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d There\u2019s no time limit and there shouldn\u2019t be.", "description": "Text.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
