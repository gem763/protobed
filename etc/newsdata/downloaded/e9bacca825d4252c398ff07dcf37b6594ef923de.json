I find that the Nifty 50 has lost more than 100 after touching the highs of 11,660; within first 1.5 Hrs; and constantly try to defend the level of 11,560 after touching the day\u2019s low at 11,473. I find that currently, prevailing volatility in Nifty 50 makes the situation more indecisive; where I find that if the Nifty 50 is not able to defend the level of 11,380 till today\u2019s closing; which will result in formation of an extremely \u201cExhaustive Candle\u201d of the year 2019; which may even drag the Nifty more down from the current levels. I find that if the Nifty takes a sustainable move below the level of 11,400, where the bears become more aggressive; Nifty may head towards a more bearish zone.\n\nNo doubt that the current developments at Sino-U.S. Tariff Trade War front seems to be heading towards some constructive talks in October; as , the United States removed tariffs from more than 400 Chinese products in response to requests from U.S. companies, but despite this improved tone, global equity markets still look unconvinced about the possibility of deal soon.\n\nOn the other hand, growing tension in Mideast region since the Pentagon has ordered deployment of additional troops in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia's air and missile defenses, following an attack on Saudi oil facilities on last Saturday; looks evident enough to keep the crude prices above $58 which may enhance bearishness in global equity markets.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the looks to swing amid hopes and fear at the current level; which indicates that today\u2019s closing level will define the further directional move of Nifty. The need of the hour is to keep a vigil eye over the movements of and Crude prices because their strength and weakness define the direction of upcoming changes in geopolitical moves.
