Never before has their management undercut their scientifically sound reasoning and forecasts.\"\n\nHe added that weather workers are \"shocked, stunned and irate\" at the statement.\n\nAs well as comments made to the Daily Beast, Sobien sent a series of tweets Friday criticizing the NOAA's statement, calling it \"utterly disgusting and disingenuous.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Sobien said he was \"embarrassed\" by the NOAA.\n\nSobien's view was backed up by other senior figures in the meteorology and climate profession, with David Titley, a former chief operating officer of the NOAA and ex-chief oceanographer for the US Navy saying that the statement sent Friday represented the \"darkest day ever\" for the leadership of the agency.\n\nHe went on to accuse the NOAA's leaders of \"moral cowardice.\"\n\n\"Frankly the lack of support for the truth & the #NWS workforce makes me sick,\" Titley said in another tweet.\n\nRead more: CNN and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham spar over a mistake in the network's Hurricane Dorian coverage\n\nTrump spent the week defending his assertion that Alabama was initially in the path of Hurricane Dorian\n\nPresident Donald J.
