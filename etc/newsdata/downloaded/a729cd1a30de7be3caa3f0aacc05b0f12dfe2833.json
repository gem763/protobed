Scott Morrison arrives there for a much-feted state dinner on Friday as one of the few allies that President Donald Trump has not fallen out with. His come-from-behind election win in May with the support of forgotten voters parallels Mr Trump\u2019s own story, and the Prime Minister\u2019s down-home suburban manner appeals to the President where other world leaders have grated. But rarely has the diplomatic box seat been so important. The trip comes as Australia\u2019s two most essential partners, the US and China, stand at the biggest crossroads in their relations since China reopened its door to the world in the 1970s. Australia has to help defuse the trade war and strategic tensions between them, both for our own sake and for that of the rest of the world.\n\nMr Morrison\u2019s analysis is succinct. China has outgrown the developing country privileges under which it rose from threadbare communist state to the world\u2019s second largest economy. Mr Morrison supports the US position that we need new trade rules to acknowledge this. \u201cIt\u2019s history. We are finding ourselves in a new phase,\u201d Mr Morrison told The Australian Financial Review on the sidelines of the G7 at Biarritz. Sooner or later, a US president would have to deal with it.\n\nThe problem is that the trade war is also a geopolitical struggle by other means. Hawks say that China has now inflicted on the world an unsustainable mercantilist model that demands an outsize share of the global economy. That\u2019s all about keeping the Communist Party in power, bending the rules of world trade to suit China, while it displaces \u2013 in whole or in part \u2013 the US as Pacific hegemon.\n\nBut Mr Trump\u2019s policies are an overreaction, tossing out the whole postwar WTO trade framework in favour of deals he can extract one-on-one from China. He thinks it's quite natural for America\u2019s great historic strengths \u2013 such as access to its markets and technology, and the power of the world\u2019s reserve currency \u2013 to be used not as supports and stablisers for the whole global system, but to be weaponised for America\u2019s advantage. Both sides are torching the global economic order to further their own fight.\n\nA Balkanised system is a disaster for mid-sized open economies such as Australia that depend on rules to trade freely on equal terms with giants. The Reserve Bank warns that our farm and gas exports would be losers in a bilateral carve-up between the US and China. Politicised trade is already having an impact, as The Australian Financial Review reports: aluminium exports to the US are booming because we escaped the Trump tariffs, yet the Morrison government has told producers to hold back lest the Americans reconsider.", "description": "Australia doesn't believe in dead-end containment of China.
