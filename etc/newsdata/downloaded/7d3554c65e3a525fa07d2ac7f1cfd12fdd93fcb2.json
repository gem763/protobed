He then drove around in his vehicle randomly firing at victims in more than 15 different locations, including a car dealership and a movie theater, police said.\n\nThe victims killed ranged in age from 15 to 57, and Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said on Sunday that the carnage could have been much worse had police not killed him before he got inside a crowded movie theater.\n\n\"He showed up at a movie theater, which would tend to show his motive,\" Gerke said.\n\nSue Ogrocki/AP\n\nThe chief declined to identify the suspect during the news conference, saying, \"I'm not going to give him any notoriety for what he did.\"\n\nHe told reported the suspect's name would be released soon, but not in a public forum. The Odessa Police Department later released the suspect's name on its Facebook page.\n\nGerke said that among the 22 people injured were three law enforcement officers and a 17-month-old girl.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott lamented having to go to another \"shattered\" Texas town to discuss a mass shooting, saying, \"Too many Texans are dying.\"\n\nDuring the news conference, Abbott read a text message from the mother of the toddler who was wounded in the rampage.\n\n\"This is all of our worst nightmare,\" the mother wrote in the text, according to Abbott. \"But thank God she is alive and relatively well.\"\n\nThe mother said her daughter suffered injuries to her lip, teeth and tongue, and shrapnel wounds to her chest.\n\n\"She\u2019s having surgery tomorrow to remove the shrapnel from her chest and to fix her lip and mouth and to get a better look at her tongue,\" the mother wrote. \"We are thanking God for healing her and appreciate continued prayers.\u201d\n\nPolice initially said five people were killed, but that number included the shooter. On Sunday, Gerke said the number of people allegedly killed by the gunman rose overnight from four to seven.\n\n\"It should have been a great day, a long holiday weekend,\" Gerke said. \"Instead, it was a little after 3 in the afternoon we had something happen that we'd never wish on anyone.\"\n\nThe shootings unfolded just at 3:15 p.m. local time when a Texas Department of Public Safety officer pulled the suspect's gold Honda over for failing signal before making a turn, Gerke said.\n\nAs the officer approached the Honda, the suspect opened fire without warning, wounding the officer, who later underwent surgery and remained hospitalized on Sunday, officials said.\n\nDustin Fawcett via AP\n\nChristopher Combs, special agent in charge of the FBI field office in San Antonio, said the weapon used in the shooting was an AR-type rifle. He said it remained under investigation how the suspect obtained the weapon.\n\nGerke said that after the suspect, described as white and in his 30s, shot the trooper, he fled along Interstate 20 toward Odessa, targeting people more than 15 different locations.\n\nWhen he reached 42nd Street in Odessa, he opened fire again, wounding several more people, authorities added.\n\nAs police from multiple agencies scrambled to stop the rolling rampage, authorities mistakenly thought there were two gunmen after the suspect ditched his vehicle and allegedly carjacked a U.S. Postal Service van, officials said.\n\nThe alleged killer then sped toward the Cinergy center, a local entertainment complex that includes a cineplex and a laser-tag range.\n\nMeztli Sanchez told ABC News that she was playing laser-tag with her 7-year-old son, when people rushed into the indoor range, screaming that the shooter was outside.\n\nSanchez said she, her son and other panicked patrons ran to the rear of the cineplex, where some ran into a field as more gunfire broke out.\n\n\"I grabbed my son and put him behind me and held him against the wall until the shooting stopped,\" Sanchez told ABC News on Sunday morning when she returned to Cinergy center to pick up her truck, which she left in the parking lot.\n\nA cellphone video taken by a witness showed the suspect speeding toward the cineplex in the postal van before a police officer in a marked SUV rammed the van on the driver's side, causing it to spin out and stop. Within seconds, police open fire on the van, killing the driver inside.\n\nThe suspect was shot and killed by responding officers after he rammed at least one patrol cars with the stolen mail van, police said.\n\nErnst Villanueva via AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe motive for the shooting is under investigation, police said.\n\nMario A Leal via Reuters\n\nA Midland police officer was also shot and underwent surgery, Morales said.\n\nThe three injured officers suffered non-life-threatening wounds, officials said.\n\nMidland Memorial Hospital received six patients and another 13 patients were taken to Medical Health Center, according to the hospital's president, Russell Tippin.\n\nThree of shooting victims died after being taken to hospitals, officials said.\n\nRick Lobo via Reuters\n\nCinergy Entertainment, the entertainment center where the rampage came to an end, released a statement on Twitter calling the shooting a \"senseless tragedy.\"\n\n\"The safety of our team members and guests are our top priority and we are extremely grateful for the swift response from local authorities & first responders,\" the statement read.\n\nOur hearts and prayers go out to the victims and the families of the senseless tragedy in the Odessa/Midland community.

Abbott said in an earlier statement.\n\n\"We will not allow the Lone Star State to be overrun by hatred and violence. We will unite, as Texans always do, to respond to this tragedy,\u201d he added. \"We offer our unwavering support to the victims, their families, and all the people of Midland and Odessa.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted that he's been briefed by the attorney general.\n\n\"FBI and Law Enforcement is fully engaged,\" he tweeted. \"More to follow.\"\n\nThe shooting came a day before eight new laws that ease restrictions on guns went into the effect in Texas, including prohibiting landlords from banning tenants from having guns in their apartments and allowing people licensed to carry concealed weapons to have firearms in churches and other places of worship.\n\nThe Odessa-Midland rampage was the fifth mass shooting in Texas since September 2017 that have left a combined 72 people dead and 78 wounded.", "description": "Seven people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a series of shootings near Odessa in western Texas.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/odessa-3-rt-er-190901_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
