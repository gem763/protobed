Safety Jamal Adams expressed some frustration Tuesday after he was benched during Monday\u2019s game.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThe 23-year-old Adams says he was benched after he misdiagnosed a play.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJamal Adams on @WFAN660: \u201cI tried to anticipate a play and I anticipated wrong. They benched me.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t give a direct answer when asked about removing the Jets from his social media accounts. #Jets \u2014 Rich Cimini (@RichCimini) September 17, 2019\n\nAdams raised more eyebrows Tuesday morning when he removed mention of the Jets from his Twitter profile. His old profile used to read \u201cdefensive back for the New York Jets.\u201d That has been replaced with a religious quote.\n\nMore evidence of Jamal Adams changing his bio to remove the #Jets\n\n\n\nThis was Adams' bio Tuesday morning vs now. pic.twitter.com/l6Zkn1nO1O \u2014 Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) September 17, 2019\n\nWhile the NFL has seen a couple frustrated players call for trades, it doesn\u2019t sound like Adams will take that same path. Adams made it clear he believes he can win with the Jets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBenching a star player is always going to be controversial, but the decision was even more puzzling with Adams. With the Jets trailing 23-3 on Monday, Adams was still playing hard.\n\nFive minutes left. The #Jets down, 23-3. Game is over.\n\n\n\nThis is how hard Jamal Adams is playing.\n\n\n\nBut #NYJ decided to bench him because he jumped offside trying to make another play late.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d be pissed, too. pic.twitter.com/AIK3HzXb58 \u2014 Connor Hughes (@Connor_J_Hughes) September 17, 2019\n\nSince coming into the league in 2017, Adams has developed into one of the premier safeties in football.
