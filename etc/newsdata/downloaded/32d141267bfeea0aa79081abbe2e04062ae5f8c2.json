The Senate Should Say No", "language": "en", "text": "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images washington and the world Trump Wants a Torture Proponent to Lead U.S. Human Rights Policy. The Senate Should Say No\n\nRob Berschinski is senior vice president for policy at Human Rights First. Previously, he was deputy assistant secretary of State for democracy, human rights, and labor, and an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force. Benjamin Haas is advocacy counsel at Human Rights First. Previously, he was an intelligence officer in the U.S. Army.\n\nDonald Trump has made no secret of his penchant for torture. It was, of course, a feature of his 2016 campaign. And while former Defense Secretary James Mattis and other senior foreign policy appointees have rejected the practice as unlawful and inappropriate, Trump has repeatedly nominated figures involved in or supportive of Bush-era torture for positions in both his administration and the federal judiciary.\n\nNow, the president has nominated yet another official with a pro-torture background\u2014Marshall Billingslea, who currently serves as assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing. This time, however, the nomination contains a particularly searing irony. If confirmed, Billingslea would become the top U.S. executive branch official directly responsible for human rights policy: undersecretary of State for civilian security, democracy and human rights.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBillingslea\u2019s involvement in Bush-era torture should be disqualifying. It renders him incapable of effectively performing the important human rights work of the post for which he is being considered. And yet his nomination hearing is scheduled for Thursday. That the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would even consider Billingslea\u2019s nomination highlights today\u2019s low standard for Trump administration nominees. Given his record, Billingslea\u2019s nomination should not advance to a full Senate vote after his hearing. And if it does, senators should vote against his confirmation.\n\nBillingslea\u2019s history promoting torture is well documented. As a senior Pentagon official during the Bush administration, he advocated for the use of torture techniques, often in contrast to the sound advice proffered by top military lawyers. According to Major General Thomas Romig, who at the time was the Army\u2019s Judge Advocate General, Billingslea dismissed Romig\u2019s protests against the use of torture. \u201cGuys, it\u2019s time to wake up and smell the coffee. It\u2019s time to take the gloves off,\u201d Romig recounted Billingslea saying. Romig, who knew torture was illegal and could expose U.S. service members to criminal prosecution, responded, \"Do you realize the implications of what you're saying?\u201d\n\nLater, when General Richard Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, proposed that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approve only some interrogation techniques, Billingslea encouraged an alternative path. Myers\u2019 recommendation, Billingslea said, omitted nearly a dozen interrogation methods favored by a Pentagon working group in which Billingslea participated that ultimately sidelined its dissenting lawyers. In Billingslea\u2019s view, Rumsfeld should approve all of the working group\u2019s recommendations, including those that top uniformed lawyers had suggested were unlawful, would undermine military discipline and would adversely impact the support of allies.\n\nConsider, too, Billingslea\u2019s involvement in the case of Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a Mauritanian man suspected of being a member of al Qaeda who was detained without charge at Guantanamo Bay for 14 years until his release in 2016. In July 2003, Billingslea advanced a memo to Rumsfeld authorizing Slahi\u2019s harsh interrogation plan. On it, Billingslea hand-wrote, \u201cWe don't see any policy issues with these interrogation techniques. Recommend you authorize.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, the Pentagon\u2019s uniformed lawyers had by that time made clear to the working group a range of legal and policy objections to exactly the sort of treatment prescribed for Slahi. Ultimately, Slahi was tortured so severely that staff at Guantanamo reported he started \u201chearing voices.\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Couch, the Marine officer assigned to prosecute Slahi, later resigned because he determined that the torture had rendered evidence in the case inadmissible.\n\nAmerica\u2019s decision not to grapple with its legacy of torture continues to undercut our country\u2019s moral authority. Yet despite this evident hypocrisy, we\u2019ve each seen first-hand how the United States inspires victims of human rights violations around the world. Despite many of the Trump administration\u2019s best efforts, activists and citizens fighting against repression still look to the United States as their best hope.\n\nThe position Billingslea seeks to occupy oversees offices focused on pursuing justice for war crimes, fighting human trafficking and protecting refugees, among other things. The State Department officials he would lead encounter stories of men and women tortured and abused every day. These public servants, and the foreign survivors they struggle to help, would not be well served with Billingslea at the helm of America\u2019s human rights policy.\n\nConsider the implications. With Billingslea as the State Department\u2019s top human rights envoy, what will he say when faced with those who have survived torture at the hands of America\u2019s enemies, or worse yet, its friends? How will he confront foreign governments for their human rights violations? When a future Chinese, Venezuelan, Iranian or Saudi Arabian government official deflects credible allegations of torture, will they simply say, \u201cMarshall, we\u2019re taking the gloves off, just like you did\u201d? You better believe they will.\n\n", "description": "Marshall Billingslea involvement in Bush-era torture should be disqualifying.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn", "Rob Berschinski", "Benjamin Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/44/4d/db5be5094f8d80a61d17031f6120/190916-billingslea-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
