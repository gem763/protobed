But by the time the owner of Court Yard Estates sent her to the hospital in an ambulance, the severe pressure sores and bite marks from rats gnawing on her flesh spoke for themselves.\n\n\u201cIt was negligent and preventable,\u201d said Jasper Mu\u00f1oz, a former caregiver who worked at the home for eight months through May 2017. When he complained that the number of rats in the home was out of control - about a year before Geslicki died - he said the care home\u2019s operator, Dimitri Zafiris, just laughed and said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just feed the rats?\u201d\n\nZafiris later would face elder abuse charges related to Geslicki\u2019s case and would be accused of wage theft by some of his care-home employees, who say they are owed more than $221,000. Zafiris is not the only care-home owner cited for mistreating seniors as well as workers.\n\nAn investigation by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting found that some operators of senior board-and-care homes that violate labor laws and steal workers\u2019 wages - previously exposed by Reveal - often also endanger or neglect their residents, sometimes with dire consequences.\n\nReveal analyzed thousands of licensing records and hundreds of U.S. Department of Labor cases in California and conducted two dozen interviews with workers, residents and their family members.\n\nReveal\u2019s review provides the first comprehensive accounting of failures in care homes whose operators preyed on vulnerable caregivers, many of them poor immigrants, and elderly residents. In California, which has the most licensed senior care homes of any state, federal data shows that operators broke minimum wage, overtime or record-keeping laws in more than 500 cases over the last decade. In 1 in 5 of these cases, operators were cited for health and safety violations that endangered residents, Reveal found.\n\nAsked about Reveal\u2019s findings, Vicky Waters, a spokeswoman for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said two state agencies are working on a new enforcement initiative to crack down on the mistreatment of workers and seniors.\n\n\u201cThe Administration is committed to protecting the rights of workers and well-being of consumers,\u201d Waters wrote in an email. \u201cThe California Department of Social Services and the California Department of Industrial Relations are launching an effort under which the Departments will work closely together to ensure compliance with labor and licensing laws, including data sharing, joint meetings with licensees, and legal actions up to and including license revocation.\u201d\n\nWaters declined to elaborate on the developing plan, including when it would start and which senior care homes would be subject to closer scrutiny.\n\nIn May, Reveal reported widespread exploitation of caregivers in senior residential care homes, many of whom earn as little as $2 an hour to work around the clock with no days off, while some industry operators make millions. Caregivers routinely are harassed and fired if they complain.\n\nReveal also found that companies caught stealing from workers continue to operate illegally despite outstanding wage theft judgments, leaving scores of workers unpaid. California regulators had said they could not strip these companies of their licenses unless residents\u2019 health and safety were threatened.\n\nSimilar lapses that endangered Geslicki and other residents at Court Yard Estates have played out in care homes across the state, where homes cited for violating federal labor laws also often endanger and neglect residents in ways big and small.\n\nFor example, at Walnut Creek Willows care home in the San Francisco Bay Area, investigators found residents sitting in soiled underwear and a resident wandering about with a bruised and bloody foot. The staff ignored both, records show. At Sonia\u2019s Care Home in Stockton, a resident who fractured a hip in 2017 had to be hospitalized, but staff were cited for failing to notify licensing officials as required. That same year, Spring Hills Assisted Living in Redding lacked records stretching back four years that staff had received the care training required by the state. Walnut Creek\u2019s president did not return a call requesting comment. The owners of Sonia\u2019s Care Home and Spring Hills declined to comment.\n\nIn 2017, a year after Nora\u2019s Home Care #2 in Fair Oaks, northeast of Sacramento, was caught violating federal labor laws, a man died not long after being admitted to the care home. Medical records show the man\u2019s diet was supposed to be restricted to pureed food, but Eleonora Berci, the home\u2019s administrator at the time, told state inspectors that she had been distracted and fed him solid food. She also forgot to tell the other caregiver about his restricted diet. He was fed stew, macaroni and applesauce.\n\nAfter noticing that he was spitting out saliva, Berci sent him to the hospital, where he told doctors that something was stuck in his throat. He was treated for bronchitis and sent back to the care home, where caregivers gave him applesauce with his medications. He began throwing up and aspirating and was sent back to the hospital an hour after he was released. He died two weeks later of aspiration pneumonia and food in his esophagus. Berci declined to comment for this story.\n\nState and federal investigators cited the operators of these care homes for health and safety violations involving seniors, as well as labor violations such as wage theft.\n\nMore than a year before Geslicki died, Mu\u00f1oz, the former caregiver, said he encountered a rat preying on another resident who was near death. As she lay in bed, the rat bit her lip.\n\n\u201cI threw my slipper at her body to get them away,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cThe rats sensed she was going to pass away.\u201d\n\nA review of state licensing records supports the worker\u2019s account of the rat infestation at the care home in Rancho Palos Verdes, an upscale community along the coast south of Los Angeles. It was one of three care homes operated by Zafiris. The other two, Ocean Park Residence I and II, were in Santa Monica.\n\nSoon after Geslicki, 91, returned to the care home from the hospital in February 2018, state inspectors interviewed a staff member who told them that he saw a rat and rat droppings around Geslicki\u2019s blanket. Geslicki was missing skin on her left hand, and the arch of her left foot had bite marks.\n\nShe died four days later. The cause was sepsis and pneumonia, according to her death certificate. Two small rodents were caught at the care home just days after Geslicki died.\n\nThe care home\u2019s treatment \u201cresulted in R1 (Geslicki) suffering a serious bodily injury, including the development of numerous pressure injuries between August 2017 and February 2018 and sustaining rat bites to R1\u2019s body, ultimately leading to hospitalization,\u201d state inspectors noted in a February 2019 report. At least 10 pressure sores covered her back, thigh, feet and elsewhere.\n\nState records do not explain why it took almost a year for inspectors to move residents out of the care home and temporarily suspend Zafiris\u2018 license to operate the three care homes. Court Yard Estates was fined $10,000 for neglect and failing to report Geslicki\u2019s injuries, hospitalization and death to licensing officials. It is not clear how long Geslicki had been dead before state regulators learned she had died.\n\nAdam Weintraub, a spokesman for the California Department of Social Services, declined to comment on the state\u2019s investigation, citing its pending case against Zafiris. The state is seeking to permanently revoke his care-home licenses and ban him from ever operating a care home in California, according to state documents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so unfair that my business has been shut down,\u201d Zafiris said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey ruined me for life. You are guilty before you\u2019re proven innocent. I have some responsibility for what took place, but caregivers were responsible for the rats. There\u2019s no connection between the rats and Elaine\u2019s death.\u201d\n\nIn January, the California Justice Department charged Zafiris and Nelia Garcia, one of his employees, with elder abuse involving Geslicki\u2019s care. In court filings, state prosecutors say they allowed her \u201cto suffer, or inflicted thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental suffering.\u201d Zafiris pleaded no contest and awaits sentencing in January. Garcia is said to have fled the country and could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn recent years, the state also cited the care home for hiring workers without conducting criminal background checks and for violations such as peeling paint, broken lights, dead flies encrusted on dusty windows, a broken air conditioning and heating system and a lack of carbon monoxide detectors. Workers told Reveal that the care home often ran out of basics, forcing them to dip into their own money to buy milk, soap and other supplies.\n\nFormer workers say the operator also underpaid staff. Last year, Mu\u00f1oz and another former caregiver filed wage theft claims totaling more than $221,000 against Court Yard Estates. They said they were paid as little as $3.33 an hour. Their claims are pending. The state labor commissioner\u2019s office in December 2018 imposed a penalty of nearly $197,000 against Zafiris\u2018 company for failing to get workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Zafiris appealed. His company, Ocean View Residence, which operated the three care homes, filed for bankruptcy in April.\n\n\u201cHe was very greedy,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cHe has accumulated a lot of money over years and years off the backs of workers.\u201d\n\nZafiris\u2018 Facebook postings and photos are a testament to his family\u2019s jet-setting around the world. Last year, they traveled to Paris, where they posed in front of the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame and dined at the famed La M\u00e8re Catherine next to the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur Basilica. In 2017, the couple visited the French Riviera. Before that, the family took in sunsets at a resort in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.\n\n\u201cMargherita (sic) time Mexican style,\u201d Zafiris posted on Facebook with a photo of the family celebrating with a toast.\n\nIn an interview, Mu\u00f1oz said Zafiris called him after learning he had filed a wage theft claim. Zafiris, he said, lashed out: \u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re dealing with, I can make a phone call, I\u2019m connected to the Mafia.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I never did that,\u201d Zafiris said in an interview. \u201cThere is no such thing. These caregivers are gold diggers.\u201d\n\nMu\u00f1oz said he slept on a mattress on the living room floor or the couch. At night, rats skittered along the floor and chewed through care packages residents had received from their families. When the light flicked on, they\u2019d scatter.\n\nGeslicki\u2019s son, Mark, who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes near the care home, said he learned about the rats after receiving an anonymous text in early 2018, several months before his mother died. The message said his mother had been bitten by rats and was in danger. Caregivers then told him that they had seen rats in the living room. Mark Geslicki said he confronted Zafiris, who took him on a walk around the care home. Mark Geslicki said he spotted dead rats in a bucket by the side of the house. But he said Zafiris assured him that he had hired an exterminator who was handling the infestation.\n\n\u201cThere was a rat problem, but I thought he\u2019d addressed it,\u201d Mark Geslicki said. \u201cI believed he was doing everything he could.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In her final months, Elaine Geslicki, a bedridden dementia resident at a home for seniors in the Los Angeles area, had difficulty communicating.
