I think being part of this family, in this role, in this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash it takes me straight back, so in that respect it's the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.'\n\nIn a heartbreaking interview, the Duke of Sussex, 35, (pictured) told ITV News at Ten anchor, Tom Bradby, (also pictured) that every click and flash of a camera in the public eye gives him 'the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best'\n\nHarry made the comments during his and his wife's recent 10-day tour of Africa during which he emotionally retraced his mother's footsteps 22 years after her death (Diana is pictured with Harry on holiday in Majorca, Spain on August 10, 1987)\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their son Archie meet with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Mrs Tutu at their legacy foundation in Cape Town, on day three of their tour of Africa last month\n\nHe made the comments during his and his wife's recent 10-day tour of Africa during which he emotionally retraced his mother's footsteps 22 years after her death.\n\nDuring the interview, which is due to be broadcast on Sunday at 9pm on ITV, Prince Harry says that media focus around being a member of the Royal family means he 'gets reminded of the bad stuff'.\n\nHe added: 'Being here now, 22 years later, trying to finish what she started will be incredibly emotional. But everything I do reminds of her.\n\n'But as I said, with the role, with the job and the sort of the pressure that come with that I get reminded of the bad stuff, unfortunately.'\n\nDuring the tour Prince Harry paid an 'emotional' visit to a street in Angola that was once a minefield visited by his mother Diana shortly before her death.\n\nPrincess Diana walked across a cleared minefield near the central city of Huambo in 1997 to highlight the plight of a country that remains plagued by land mines 17 years after the end of its civil war.\n\nThe images of her in body armour and a mask gave the anti-landmine campaign global recognition.\n\nJust months later Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris, when Harry was 12.\n\n'It has been emotional retracing my mother's steps along this street 22 years on,' said Harry, standing on Huambo's now-paved Princess Diana Street during the tour.\n\n'Being here on this transformed and bustling street... shows the tremendous impact that clearing landmines has on communities and their futures.'\n\nLast month the Duke of Sussex walks through a minefield in Dirico, Angola, during a visit to see the work of landmine clearance charity the Halo Trust\n\nHarry's mother Diana visited a minefield in Angola in January, 1997.

He was hugely struck by the transformation in Huambo and is incredibly passionate about honouring the work started by his mother.\n\n'He is committed to helping Halo emulate in Angola what we've achieved in Mozambique by making it mine free.'\n\nHarry is pictured sitting beneath the Diana Tree in Huambo, which marks the spot where she was photographed in 1997\n\nSigns saying 'danger mines' are the same as the ones his mother was pictured with in 1997\n\nMr Cowan, who joined the Scottish-based landmine clearance charity in 2015, said Harry has a 'great sense of what really matters in the world'.\n\nHe added: 'I know Prince Harry a little bit from our time in the military and I've been delighted to work with him at Halo.\n\n'He's funny, he's got charisma, and he's also got a great sense of what really matters in this world. I think that is a very wonderful combination.'\n\nDiana never saw her work to help outlaw landmines come to fruition as she died later in the same year as her visit to Angola, a few months before the international treaty to ban the weapons was signed.\n\nThe site has since been transformed into a wide residential road called Avenida 28 de Maio - but is affectionately known among locals as Princess Diana Street.\n\nThe documentary Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, will air on ITV on Sunday at 9pm.", "description": "The Duke of Sussex, 35, made the comments during his and his wife's\u00a0recent 10-day tour of Africa in which he emotionally retraced his mother's footsteps 22 years after her death.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton", "James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/19/19852826-0-image-a-88_1571338325062.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
