He then told me to stop looking at him,\" Murray added.\n\n\"The sound came from him, which you're not allowed to do, it's against the rules, it's hindrance, you shouldn't do it.\"\n\nThe three-time Grand Slam winner was frustrated the chair umpire failed to intervene as the match turned increasingly sour.\n\nTuesday should have been a day for minor celebration after the Australian Open said that Murray will make his return to Grand Slam tennis there in January, a year after surgery.\n\n\"Fabio wanted to engage with me, I probably shouldn't have done, but I am not having him talk to me like that on court,\" said Murray of their exchange.\n\nThe former number one was also annoyed he repeatedly served for the match but failed to win.\n\n\"I want to say that's the first time ever in my career that that's happened,\" Murray said.\n\n\"I think it's the first time I served for a match twice and not won.\"\n\nRuthless Roger Federer claimed victory in his opener with a straight-sets win over Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas.\n\nThe 38-year-old Swiss won 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) and plays Belgium's 13th seed David Goffin or Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan in the last 16.\n\nThe third-ranked Federer is looking to end the season on a high with a fourth title of the year -- although he failed to win a 21st Grand Slam this season.\n\nThe 46th-ranked Ramos-Vinolas put up a better fight in the second set, forcing the tie break and taking a 2-0 and then 4-1 lead.\n\nBut cheered on by his band of local supporters, who held aloft banners proclaiming their hero \"superhuman\", Federer won the tie break -- and the match -- with a forehand smash.\n\nFederer said a loss to the Spaniard in 2015 in Shanghai had driven him on.\n\n\"The truth, yeah, I was thinking about it, watched highlights,\" said the Swiss maestro.\n\n\"Remember how it felt, I had my chances. I won many more points that time than I lost, so I should have actually won that match.\"\n\nRed-hot Daniil Medvedev, the US Open finalist, got his tournament off to a flying start with a 6-3, 6-1 demolition of Britain's Cameron Norrie.\n\nATP tournament results after Tuesday's matches, here in Shanghai:\n\nMen's singles\n\n1st round\n\nLucas Pouille (FRA) bt Zhe Li (CHN) 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 6-4\n\nJohn Isner (USA x16) bt Alex De Minaur (AUS) 7-6 (7/1), 6-4\n\nF\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime (CAN) bt Alexander Bublik (KAZ) 7-6 (7/5), 4-0 abandon\n\nReilly Opelka (USA) bt Dusan Lajovic (SRB) 6-3, 6-4\n\nMatteo Berrettini (ITA x11) bt Jan-Lennard Struff (GER) 6-2, 6-1\n\nJohn Millman (AUS) bt Guido Pella (ARG) 6-3, 7-5\n\nAndrey Rublev (RUS) bt Borna Coric (CRO x12) 6-4, 7-6 (7/4)\n\nDavid Goffin (BEL x13) bt Richard Gasquet (FRA) 6-2, 6-3\n\nMen's singles\n\n2nd round\n\nHubert Hurkacz (POL) bt Gael Monfils (FRA x9) 6-2, 7-6 (7/1)\n\nDaniil Medvedev (RUS x3) bt Cameron Norrie (GBR) 6-3, 6-1\n\nVasek Pospisil (CAN) bt Jo\u00e3o Sousa (POR) 6-3, 7-5\n\nFabio Fognini (ITA x10) bt Andy Murray (SCO) 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 7-6 (7/2)\n\nNikoloz Basilashvili (GEO x15) bt Beno\u00eet Paire (FRA) 6-4, 1-6, 6-1\n\nRoger Federer (SUI x2) bt Albert Ramos (ESP) 6-2, 7-6 (7/5)", "description": "Andy Murray went down scrapping in a bruising three-set defeat to 12th-ranked Italian Fabio Fognini at the Shanghai Masters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9448/2b9d27550f34499db392d8f66e8af44f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
