But the Economy Is Still at Risk.", "language": "en", "text": "For one brief, terrifying moment this summer, the word \u201crecession\u201d was on everyone\u2019s lips \u2014 the stuff of television segments, front-page articles and Google searches.\n\nThen, just as abruptly, everything started to look pretty much fine.\n\nThe trade war with China went into another of its periodic phases of de-escalation, as the Trump administration seemed rattled about the possibility of a faltering economy. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates twice, something of an insurance policy against a recession. Much of the data on the economy, particularly on the job market and the service sector, remained quite solid.\n\nAnd the proximate cause of many of those August recession warnings, a sharp drop in longer-term interest rates and a so-called yield curve inversion, was partly reversed.\n\nCrisis averted! That, anyway, has been the mood in financial markets in the last few weeks, as stocks have remained near record highs and the fearful tenor of economic commentary has subsided.", "description": "The underlying forces that fueled worry a few weeks ago haven\u2019t gone anywhere.", "authors": ["Neil Irwin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/upshot/up-econ-sub/up-econ-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
