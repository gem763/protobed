However further delay to Brexit would mean continued economic uncertainty with \"very poor\" growth of around just 1 per cent a year.\n\nOverall, Citi, said that remaining in the EU would be the best outcome for economic growth.\n\nHowever, if this happened under a Labour government committed to carrying out its policies on tax, nationalisation, share ownership and labour policy regulation, it was impossible to say whether the net effect would be better or worse than leaving the EU with a more \"growth-friendly\" set of policies.\n\nThe IFS said ministers had now effectively abandoned former chancellor Philip Hammond's tax and spending rules, including his manifesto commitment to balance the budget by the mid 2020s.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He said that in the event of no-deal, any measures to support the economy would have to be strictly temporary.\n\n\"The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor,\" he said. \"Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming budget. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy.\n\nPress Association", "description": "Government debt is set to soar to levels not seen since the 1960s in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a leading economic think-tank has warned.
