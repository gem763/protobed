But these whistle-blowers aren\u2019t subverting Trump through back-door machinations, they\u2019re simply playing by the rules, my colleague Mike Giglio, who covers intelligence and national security, writes:\n\n\u201cDespite the White House\u2019s best efforts, the fact that the whistle-blower filed a complaint through proper government channels has made it harder for the usual attacks about traitors and dirty tricks to stick.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Saahil Desai\n\nSnapshot\n\n(Yuri Gripas / Reuters)\n\nRepresentative Steve Scalise, the House minority whip, was one of more than 20 Republicans who stormed a secure hearing room on Capitol Hill, where members of Congress were conducting a deposition of Laura Cooper, a Defense Department official, as part of the House\u2019s closed-door impeachment inquiry.\n\nSome of those who RSVP\u2019d to join the protest are already members of the House Oversight or Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nRussell Berman and Elaine Godfrey explored the tightrope Democrats are walking between the expedience of closed-door hearings and transparency that could move public opinion in their favor.\n\nIn Other News\n\n(Azad Lashkari / Reuters)\n\nCeasefire, ceased. President Trump wants to wash his hands of the Middle East. Uri Friedman writes on the grave consequences to seeming disentanglement.\n\n+ \u201cSo maybe it didn\u2019t matter what you called it\u2014it more or less worked. That is, in the very narrow sense of stopping the worst of the Turkish onslaught against the Syrian Kurds for a time,\u201d Kathy Gilsinan reports.\n\nFacebook faced the fire. Among the questions Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg fielded before the House Financial Service Committee today was one that bordered on a conspiracy theory, Rachel Gutman writes.\n\n+ Zuckerberg was officially on Capitol Hill to discuss the company\u2019s proposed cryptocurrency plans. \u201cFacebook, one of the world\u2019s most distrusted companies, wants us to trust its new Libra cryptocurrency,\u201d Eric Posner argued earlier this year.\n\nArgument of the Day\n\n(Kenzo Tribouillard / Reuters)\n\nKurt Bardella, an advisor for the House Oversight and Reform Committee during its investigation into the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, Libya, argues that Republicans are approaching the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe with hypocrisy. (Of note: Bardella switched party affiliations in 2017.)\n\nFor eight years, House Republicans searched for a \u201csmoking gun\u201d that could unravel the presidency of Barack Obama. They presided over hundreds of oversight hearings, issued more than 100 subpoenas, held the attorney general in contempt of Congress, and even formed a special select committee devoted exclusively to one investigation, on Benghazi. As someone who spent five years working alongside Republicans on the Oversight Committee, I can tell you that we never found a \u201csmoking gun\u201d like the testimony that was provided yesterday from the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor.\n\n\u2192 Read the rest", "description": "Today, when the whistle-blower drip becomes a flood. Plus, the Syria ceasefire and the fury.
