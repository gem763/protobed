The third quarter is well behind us, and companies are preparing to release their quarterly earnings reports. Earnings season is always a critical time for investors, as companies are publishing actual results. So far, investors have used estimates and indirect data to make allocation decisions; now they get to see the real numbers.\n\nWe\u2019ve opened up TipRanks\u2019 Earnings Calendar, a great tool for tracking companies\u2019 earnings reports and results. Using the calendar, we\u2019re looking at three \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 stocks set to report earnings this week, to see what about them makes the Street optimistic.\n\nMondelez International (MDLZ)\n\nThis is a holding company, created in 2012 when Kraft Foods spun off its North American grocery segments. Today, Mondelez is the parent company of numerous well-known snack brands, including Nabisco, Oreo, and Ritz, along with chocolates like Toblerone and Cadbury, and chewing gum names Trident, Dentyne, and Chiclets. Mondelez sees over $25.9 billion in annual revenue, and realizes over $2.9 billion in annual net income.\n\nMondelez\u2019 second-quarter report is historically the company\u2019s \u2018slow time;\u2019 that is, Q2 shows the company\u2019s lowest earnings during the year. In Q2 2019, MDLZ matched the EPS estimates, at 57 cents per share, and slipped slightly on revenues. The $6.06 billion reported was 0.8% down year-over-year, mostly attributed to poor currency exchange rates.\n\nLooking ahead, the company guided toward a net revenue growth of 3%, higher than the previous 2.5% estimate. Management expects currency exchange rates to put an 11-cent headwind on earnings, but the EPS forecast shows possible 3% to 5% growth. Free cash flow is expected to reach $2.8 billion for Q3.\n\n5-star RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi is bullish on MDLZ, setting a $66 price target and indicating a possible 25% upside to the stock as he initiates coverage of this company with an Outperform rating. (To watch Modi's track record, click here)\n\nSupporting his thesis, Modi writes, \u201cOver the past year, MDLZ has made material operational changes and capability upgrades that we believe will set it up to deliver revenue growth towards the upper end of the large-cap staples sector average. We see MDLZ LT targets as achievable with upside potential. For FY'20 we are modeling organic growth of 3.5% (LT algo +3%) and EPS growth of 7%.\u201d\n\nWall Street loves this stock, earning a stellar analyst consensus rating, as TipRanks analytics demonstrate MDLZ as a Strong Buy. Out of 12 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 9 are bullish on Mondelez stock, while 3 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 16%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $60.58. (See Mondelez stock analysis on TipRanks)\n\nFMC Corp. (FMC)\n\nThis chemical company is one of the most diversified manufacturers in the US. It originated as an insecticide producer, and its core product remains agricultural chemicals. At various times, however, FMC has produced vehicles for the Defense Department, and was the prime manufacturer of the M113 armored fighting vehicle. Today, FMC is best known for pesticides and fungicides, and realizes upwards of $4.7 billion in annual revenue, with over $500 million in net income.\n\nFMC beat the estimates in Q2, showing an 11% year-over-year gain in EPS, with $1.66 per share. Revenues gained 4% and came in at $1.206 billion against a forecast of $1.2 billion. As with MDLZ, FMC saw a headwind from the currency exchange rates, but not as severe. Higher pricing helped to negate the currency factor.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It\u2019s that time of year again \u2013 Earnings season!
