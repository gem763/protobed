He symbolized a lot of things that we needed for this country but did he have experience? Did he really govern or just pass executive orders and do a lot of things in a way that now have led to things that are happening today?\" Brzezinski asked on Wednesday's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nHer comments came as many questioned whether Biden's age and mental stability made him a good candidate for the 2020 presidential election. But according to Brzezinski, Biden's age was an advantage.\n\n\"All these arguments about his age \u2014 they could be turned around in a second,\" she told co-host and husband Joe Scarborough. \"Don't you want, finally, someone with experience in governing?\"\n\nBIDEN TELLS VOTERS 'DON'T VOTE FOR ME' IF THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS AGE\n\nBrzezinski also seemed to imply that Obama was partly responsible for Trump's victory in 2016. \"Who did he hand the keys to the White House to?\" she asked.\n\nSince starting his campaign, Biden has committed a slew of verbal slip-ups that many have argued have been a defining characteristic of his career as a politician.\n\nBiden seemed unfazed by concerns about his age on Saturday when he said that if people had concerns, they shouldn't vote for him.\n\nBut the gaffes appeared to have raised enough concerns that allies of the former vice president reportedly suggested he scale back the number of events he did on the campaign trail. David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Obama, blasted that idea, arguing that he shouldn't be \"cloistered.\"\n\nMONMOUTH UNIVERSITY RENOUNCES ITS OWN POLL SHOWING BIDEN PLUNGING, CALLS IT AN 'OUTLIER'\n\n\"This is bad advice. You can\u2019t cloister the candidate and win,\" tweeted Axelrod, the chief strategist of Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns. \"He either can cut it or he can\u2019t, and the only way he can prove he can is to be an active and vigorous candidate. He\u2019s running for president of the United States, for God\u2019s sake!\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe concerns appeared to prompt Biden's brain surgeon to comment on the issue as well. He insisted that his patient was mentally healthy.\n\n\u201cHe is every bit as sharp as he was 31 years ago. I haven\u2019t seen any change,\u201d Dr. Neal Kassell said, according to Politico. Kassell previously treated Biden for brain aneurysms and has monitored him for brain damage since his surgeries.", "description": "MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski attempted to defend former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0Wednesday,\u00a0amid concerns about his age, by pointing to former President Barack Obama's lack of \"experience.\"", "authors": ["Sam Dorman", "Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News.
