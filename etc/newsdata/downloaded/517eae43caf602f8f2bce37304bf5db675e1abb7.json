goals to improve the environment under plans set out by the Government.\n\nA new Environment Bill will include a framework to put long-term legal targets in place on air and water quality and boosting nature, and include measures for dealing with plastic pollution, ministers have said.\n\nAnd a new watchdog \u2013 the Office of Environmental Protection, which will be based in Bristol \u2013 will scrutinise laws, investigate complaints and take enforcement action against public authorities to uphold standards.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s powers will cover climate change legislation and hold the Government to account on the legal commitment to cut greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050, working alongside the existing advisory Committee on Climate Change.\n\nThe long-awaited Bill, which will also enshrine environmental principles in law, is not likely to make progress as a general election is expected to be called in the coming weeks or months.\n\nBut the Bill, which builds on a series of announcements on the environment under Theresa May\u2019s premiership, shows the Government is keen to set out its green credentials in the face of rising public concern over climate and wildlife.\n\nThe London skyline (Philip Toscano/PA)\n\nEnvironmental principles enshrined in law, measures to improve air, water quality, tackle plastic pollution & restore habitats, new legally-binding environmental improvement targets & independent regulator all in new environment bill #QueensSpeech \u2014 Emily Beament (@EmilyBeament) October 14, 2019\n\nAmong the measures in the draft legislation being introduced on Tuesday are plans for a legally binding target to reduce air pollutant PM2.5, a fine particulate matter.\n\nThere will also be a boost to local powers to address air pollution from domestic wood burners.\n\nAnd, in the case of a repeat of the Volkswagen emissions scandal which revealed cars were emitting more pollution than tests showed, ministers will be able to demand manufacturers recall vehicles that do not meet relevant standards.\n\nThere will also be measures to ensure net gains for wildlife in new developments, with house builders required to show they have delivered a 10% boost in nature.\n\nAnd after Sheffield Council faced criticism over tree-felling, the Bill also includes steps to give communities a greater say in the protection of local trees.\n\nThere will be a more consistent approach to recycling across England, a deposit return scheme for drinks containers and a mechanism for introducing a levy on single use plastics, similar to the carrier bag charge, that could be applied to items such as takeaway cutlery.\n\nEnvironment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: \u201cOur natural environment is a vital shared resource and the need to act to secure it for generations to come is clear.\u201d\n\nShe said the Bill would lead a \u201cgreen transformation that will help our country to thrive\u201d, and would position the UK as a world leader on improving air quality, nature and managing water resources in a changing climate.\n\n\u201cCrucially, it also ensures that after Brexit, environmental ambition and accountability are placed more clearly than ever before at the heart of government, both now and in the future,\u201d she added.\n\nJoan Edwards, director of public affairs at The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cNature and the wild places it depends on are in crisis \u2013 on land and at sea \u2013 and people are crying out for decisive action.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that this Bill kickstarts a major recovery of natural habitats and provides more space for nature to fightback \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nTanya Steele, chief executive at wildlife charity WWF, welcomed the legally binding targets to restore nature at home, but warned the Bill did not address the role the UK was playing in driving destruction of nature overseas.\n\nShe said: \u201cThis long-awaited flagship bill needs more wind in its sails, powered by stronger ambition and investment, if we\u2019re going to battle the global crisis we\u2019re facing and sail onto the world stage as a credible environmental leader.\u201d\n\nDr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, backed the plans for setting legal targets for fine particulate matter, warning \u201cthese tiny toxic particles can be some of the most dangerous for us to breathe in\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been breathing dirty air for far too long in the UK, so it\u2019s critical that clear deadlines are set, to protect all our health as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nGreenpeace called for legally binding targets to halve plastic by 2025.\n\nAnd Benjamin Halfpenny of the Greener UK coalition said that, while the Government had made progress on the legislation, new legal protections were set to be weaker than those the UK enjoys within the EU.\n\n\u201cIf the Government is committed to \u2018world-leading\u2019 standards, the minimum it can do is to commit in law to the high standards we already enjoy,\u201d he urged.", "description": "New watchdog will scrutinise laws and ensure Government is held to account on legal
