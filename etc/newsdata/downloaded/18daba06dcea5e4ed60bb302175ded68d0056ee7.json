Bernie Sanders (I-VT) may be denied medical treatment for his heart disease under his own proposed \u201cMedicare for All\u201d program. Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, outlined the possible scenario in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nSanders underwent emergency heart surgery on Tuesday in which he had two stents inserted to treat a blocked artery, recalled Pollak, asking Orient if the 78-year-old senator with heart disease would receive medical treatment for his condition within a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d framework.\n\n\u201cMedicare for all really means Medicare for nobody,\u201d replied Orient. \u201cIt would vacuum up all the funds in the Medicare trust fund as well as all the other federal funding that goes into medical care for everybody and put everybody into the same pot, and then you have to decide how to fairly allocate those resources.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nUtilitarian distribution of resources within a state-run healthcare system, explained Orient, may deny heart treatment to someone like Sanders, drawing on the propositions of Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an advocate of centrally-planned health care.\n\n\u201cNow, Bernie Sanders is 78 years old,\u201d said Orient, \u201cand there was a famous article in the Atlantic by Ezekiel Emanuel, who was one of the architects of the ACA \u2014 the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare \u2014 saying \u2026 he hoped to die at age 75.\u201d\n\nOrient continued, \u201c[Ezekiel Emanuel also said] that certainly after [age 75] he would not be getting any aggressive medical treatment. He wouldn\u2019t get treatment for cancer. He wouldn\u2019t get open-heart surgery, because, well, he\u2019d already lived a good life, and after that, you\u2019re kind of just going downhill.\u201d\n\nEmanuel co-wrote an outline for a centrally-planned health care apparatus in 2009 entitled, \u201cPrinciples for allocation of scarce medical interventions,\u201d articulating his utilitarian vision for maximization of \u201csocial usefulness.\u201d\n\nOrient stated, \u201cThe Complete Lives System that came out in the British medical journal the Lancet in 2009 talked about how society should really concentrate its resources on people between the ages of 15 and 40, because before you\u2019re 15, society hasn\u2019t invested all that much in you, and after 40, you\u2019re kind of really going on the downhill slope, so since there aren\u2019t enough goods to go around and there certainly won\u2019t be enough \u2014 there will be less and less \u2014 if we have socialism, then we have to decide who gets priority.\u201d\n\nOrient assessed how Sanders might be regarded within his own proposed healthcare system.\n\nA \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system would likely deprioritize allocation of medical resources to \u201ca 78-year-old man with heart disease [and] bad arteries [who is] likely to have other emergencies in the future\u201d in favor of \u201ctaking care of younger people,\u201d assessed Orient, drawing on Emanuel\u2019s utilitarian ethos.\n\nOrient estimated, \u201cIf [Bernie Sanders] were in Canada, under the Canadian system, he might have died, or he might have made a quick trip to Detroit or Seattle or some other place close to the Canadian border to get his cardiac [catheterization] and his stent placed in an American hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got [catheterization] labs all over the place, but under socialized medicine, the sophisticated facilities are much rarer, and sometimes their equipment is shabby and outdated and too dangerous to use, but that\u2019s what you get when you\u2019re focusing on population instead of trying to do the best you can for all of your patients,\u201d added Orient.\n\nOrient addressed a frequent refrain she encounters during her discourses on health care.\n\n\u201cEvery time I give a talk, there\u2019s somebody in the audience who says, \u2018The Canadians really love their system,\u2019 but the Canadians who really love it are mostly those who never have to use it,\u201d Orient stated. \u201cThose who need urgent care will either suffer or even die or they will come to the United States or some other place to get timely treatment.\u201d\n\nOrient continued, \u201cSome Canadians think that\u2019s just fine, that\u2019s just part of being socially responsible, but a lot of them say, \u2018It\u2019s my health, it\u2019s my money, why shouldn\u2019t I be able to use my hard-earned money to provide something better for myself?'\u201d\n\nMansour invited Orient\u2019s recommendations for healthcare system reform.\n\n\u201cI think we need to get back to the concept of insurance, which is like car insurance and homeowners\u2019 insurance,\u201d replied Orient. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect it to pay for every little thing. With Canadian [health care], you don\u2019t want to go to the hospital to get a kidney removed, but you sure want to go to the doctor for every little thing, because after all, you\u2019ve paid through the nose in your taxes and you want to get your money\u2019s worth, so there\u2019s a huge demand for services that are really not necessary, but are not really painful or dangerous, and those are the ones that will drive up the cost.\u201d\n\nOrient went on, \u201cI mean, to have insurance for a flu shot, what could be more ridiculous? It probably doubles or triples the cost. It adds a claims processing fee to every single transaction, and it creates a moral hazard for everybody. Those doctors or hospitals can raise their fees because they figure a patient won\u2019t care. The patient doesn\u2019t need to look at the price tag because the insurance company is supposed to pay. The insurance companies don\u2019t care that they\u2019re paying out big claims because they can just raise the premiums, so you get into this merry-go-round, and the only way to really stop it is to stop the third-party payment which is such a moral hazard.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople should be paying for most medical bills out of pocket,\u201d concluded Orient. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper. It puts them in control of things. They get better care that way, and that way you can have insurance that really works instead of having a gatekeeper standing at the door trying to deny you things that you really do need.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "Bernie Sanders may be denied treatment for his heart disease under his own proposed \"Medicare for All\" program, explained Dr. Jane Orient.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/hospital-treatment-bernie-sanders-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
