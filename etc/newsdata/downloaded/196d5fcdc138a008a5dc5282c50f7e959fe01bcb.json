In one boast cited by regulators, YouTube claimed to be watched by 93 percent of \u201ctweens,\u201d roughly in line with independent surveys of the viewing habits of preteens.\n\nState and federal regulators said the settlement would force YouTube and other social media companies to be mindful when children under age 13 are using their services. But a wide array of privacy advocates, lawmakers and even some of the FTC\u2019s own members said the penalties against Google would serve as no deterrent given its massive revenue.\n\n[Sex, drugs, and self-harm: Where 20 years of child online protection law went wrong]\n\nWhile the fine set a record for a violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the federal law that forbids the tracking of users under 13 without parental permission, it amounted to less than two days\u2019 worth of profits for the tech giant, advocates noted.\n\nThe settlement also held no Google executives directly accountable, didn\u2019t require the company to admit guilt and left some experts fearful that it might contain a loophole allowing YouTube to avoid liability for kids\u2019 privacy missteps in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that the FTC is finally attempting to hold Google accountable for violating COPPA at a massive scale for a number of years. But the settlement shifts far too much of the responsibility onto the content creators and not enough to YouTube, and the fine is woefully inadequate,\u201d said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, an advocacy group based in Boston that was among those who filed the complaint last year.\n\nThe tension over the settlement underscored the limits of COPPA, which is at once one of the nation\u2019s few federal privacy laws but also, critics say, outdated and unevenly enforced. The FTC has initiated a process to update the rules enforcing the law, and a major rewrite has been proposed by Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), one of the law\u2019s original authors, and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), but even their bipartisan proposal has not yet advanced on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that the moment is slipping away on the protection of children,\u201d Markey said in an interview.\n\nThe settlement accepts many of the claims raised by more than 20 consumer and privacy groups in an April 2018 complaint and echoes years of concerns that YouTube had become the most popular site for children while sidestepping COPPA. Privacy advocates long had pointed out that many popular channels on the site are directed to younger audiences, featuring nursery rhymes as well as videos of children unwrapping toys. The Post first reported on the FTC investigation in June.\n\nThe FTC and regulators in New York agreed, finding that Google\u2019s own content-rating systems had identified certain YouTube channels as directed toward children.\n\nCOPPA has two key tests in assessing whether a site must comply: whether it is directed toward children and whether the site has \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that children use it. The FTC settlement asserted Wednesday that YouTube failed both tests after years of claiming that its site was not intended for children and hence not covered by COPPA.\n\n\u201cYouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. \u201cYet when it came to complying with COPPA, the company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids. There\u2019s no excuse for YouTube\u2019s violations of the law.\u201d\n\n[Federal regulators eye update to rules governing children\u2019s privacy and the Internet]\n\nThe settlement was notable for the extent to which regulators used YouTube\u2019s own statements and actions against it. They cited that YouTube\u2019s own rating system often labeled videos as intended for viewers under 13 but still allowed tracking and targeted advertising. Regulators cited the channels featuring My Little Pony, Barbie, Thomas & Friends and Hot Wheels as evidence that they were intended for a young audience.\n\nYouTube created a separate app for children in 2015, called YouTube Kids, in part to address complaints that the main platform had too many young viewers. But regulators noted that many videos appeared on both services. The only difference was that viewers were not tracked and targeted on YouTube Kids but were when the same children\u2019s videos appeared on YouTube itself.\n\nOne popular channel that has content appearing on both services, called Sandaroo Kids, says on its YouTube page, \u201cWe love dressing in Disney Princess Costumes, playing pranks and teaching kids how to learn colors,\u201d according to the complaint from regulators. The channel includes videos with such titles as \u201cBarbie & Ken Dolls Fashion Show Party with Doll Ambulance.\u201d The channel Little Baby Bum, meanwhile, had videos such as \u201cBath Song\u201d and \u201cNew Baby Brother & Sister.\u201d\n\nAlong with its fine, YouTube agreed to develop a system that would require content creators to indicate whether their videos are directed toward kids, turning off tracking for targeted ads in cases where it believes a child is watching. YouTube also announced additional changes on its own, including work to train its software to detect content that is kid-oriented using a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning.\n\n\u201cThis action is changing YouTube\u2019s business model,\u201d said Andrew Smith, the director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cYouTube cannot bury its head in the sand.\u201d\n\nBut the settlement stopped well short of what advocates were seeking. Backed by the agency\u2019s three Republicans, the settlement sparked criticism from the FTC\u2019s two Democrats, who voted against the agreement even as they criticized YouTube for profiting improperly from its younger users.\n\nIn a dissenting statement, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter expressed fears that the government\u2019s settlement requires too little from YouTube to find and discipline content creators that intentionally mislabel their videos, resulting in a \u201cfence but one with only three sides.\"\n\nDemocratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra, meanwhile, faulted the FTC for failing to obtain a larger fine for Google \u201cillegally harvesting children\u2019s data,\u201d which he wrote was \u201cextremely lucrative\u201d for Google. His dissent includes redacted data suggesting that behavioral ads improperly displayed on videos viewed by kids should have resulted in a fine in the billions of dollars.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill also blasted the FTC. \u201cWhen companies like Google repeatedly break the law, the FTC must demand structural change and executive accountability,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) said in a statement. \u201cI am concerned that the divided vote reflects a lack of resolve and a lost opportunity to impose necessary accountability measures to rein in Google\u2019s pattern of privacy abuses.\u201d\n\nIn a rare move, the FTC filed the settlement in federal court on its own. Typically, such consent orders are filed on the agency\u2019s behalf by the Justice Department, suggesting the government may have been split over some element of the YouTube investigation. \u201cFollowing a careful review by its Consumer Protection Branch, the Department of Justice declined the FTC\u2019s proposed settlement,\u201d a Justice Department official said Wednesday, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nThe FTC settlement with Google marks the latest effort to probe and penalize tech giants for their privacy abuses, punishments that have served as a litmus test \u2014 even within the agency itself \u2014 about its power to police Silicon Valley.\n\nIn July, the commission issued a historic, $5 billion fine against Facebook for allegedly deceiving users about the way it collects and shares their personal information. But the penalty is far less than what some Democrats at the FTC, lawmakers on Capitol Hill and privacy hawks had hoped for, arguing the fine was too small \u2014 and the remedies too weak \u2014 to force significant changes in Facebook\u2019s business practices.\n\nEarlier this year, the FTC issued a $5.7 million fine against the app now known as TikTok over charges that it illegally collected data from children. Democrats chafed at the FTC\u2019s decision at the time not to hold specific executives responsible for the company\u2019s abuses.\n\nDig Deeper: Personal tech + Privacy\n\nWant to learn about how to keep your personal information private?
