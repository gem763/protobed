Nolan Clark. Later this month, he\u2019ll release his latest science fiction thriller, The Last Astronaut.\n\nIn it, astronaut Sally Jansen has been working to come to grips with a Mars mission that went disastrously wrong, and NASA ended its crewed missions into space. But while she\u2019s trying to move on, scientists detect an object designated 2I/2044 D1 entering our solar system, and when it begins to slow down, they realize that it\u2019s an alien artifact. Jansen is called in to try and intercept the object and figure out what is behind it before it reaches Earth.\n\nPublisher\u2019s Weekly gave the book a starred review, and says that Wellington \u201ccreates a gripping story that reveals its horrors one inexorable, plausible detail at a time. Readers will be riveted\u2014and will want to keep all the lights on.\u201d\n\nThe novel hits stores on July 23rd, and we have an excerpt for you to read below.\n\nPreflight Check\n\nSunny had given this presentation multiple times. The first time, when he\u2019d talked to McAllister\u2019s boss \u2014 NASA\u2019s administrator, the head honcho \u2014 it took ninety minutes to get through. When he gave the same talk to NASA\u2019s advisory groups, then the mission directorates and the staff offices, he\u2019d gotten down to a tight twenty. Then one day they\u2019d put him in front of a 3-D camera and told him he would be speaking directly to the president of the United States. That time he\u2019d been given five minutes.\n\nNow he was giving the talk one last time. They promised. He was still a ball of nerves as he headed to classroom six at JPL and loaded all his files into the screen on the podium. Whom could they possibly be bringing in this time? The secretary-general of the UN? The classroom could hold 120 people. Today only four came in and sat down in the big stadium-style chairs. Two of them sat down in the middle rows, a couple of seats apart from each other. A Southeast Asian woman in a cardigan and some military guy with tons of medals on the front of his uniform. He took his hat off and carefully sat it on the seat next to him. Sunny caught the woman\u2019s eye and smiled. She gave him back a very fast, tight little smile, then leaned forward and hugged her knees, as if she was very nervous. Maybe she had some idea of what he was going to say.\n\nTwo more people came in and sat down in the front row. Roy McAllister and a middle-aged woman wearing a pair of cheap AR sunglasses. It took Sunny a minute to realize whom he was looking at.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said. \u201c Wait \u2014 she\u2019 s \u2014 you\u2019 re \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly you recognize Ms. Jansen,\u201d McAllister said. \u201cSo let me introduce you. Everyone, this is Sunny Stevens. He\u2019s an astrophysicist working in our Planetary Science Directorate. He may look young, but don\u2019t let that fool you. He\u2019s well on his way to his first Nobel. Most likely for the discovery he\u2019s going to tell you about today.\u201d\n\nSunny nodded, barely listening. It was her. Sally Jansen, looking right at him.\n\nThe woman who\u2019d killed Blaine Wilson. The woman who\u2019d lost the race for Mars. What the hell was she doing here? This was top-secret stuff, not meant for every washed-up astronaut NASA could drag in off the street \u2014\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a bit tight on time, Dr. Stevens,\u201d McAllister said. \u201cPerhaps we could . . . ?\u201d\n\nSunny nodded and exhaled deeply. He was a little thrown, but he could do this. He knew it all by heart. He just wished \u2014 he wished Jansen would take those sunglasses off. Who still wore AR sunglasses? Everybody in his generation just used an earring or a nose ring as their device. The sunglasses made it impossible to see her eyes. To know what she was thinking.\n\nStill, she was just one more person he needed to convince. Sunny knew what was at stake with these presentations. He tapped the screen on the podium and got started.\n\nLight bloomed above them as an AR image formed, pixels coalescing out of the air.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d he said, gesturing at the air above their heads, \u201cis an object called 1I/2017 U1. Also known as \u2018Oumuamua, which is a Hawaiian word meaning \u2018first messenger.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn augmented reality the object turned lazily on its short axis. It didn\u2019t look like much, honestly. It was a cigar-shaped lump of rock, a dull red in color. The image was heavily pixelated. \u201cWe never got a really good look at it. It came into the solar system way back, in 2017, long before I was born, and, uh . . .\u201d\n\nIt occurred to him that some of the people listening to him were old enough to remember 2017. They sat there looking like lumps of rock themselves. He brushed off the thought and went on.\n\n\u201cIt was just another rock, right, a piece of space debris, not even big enough to worry about.\u201d Scale bars appeared around the image, showing that \u2018Oumuamua was thirty-five meters across and 230 long. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t even figure out what it was, back then. Whether it was an asteroid or a comet. There was one thing about it, though, that got a lot of attention. It didn\u2019t come from our solar system.\u201d\n\nThe image zoomed out to show the track \u2018Oumuamua had taken around the sun. It dove out of deep space almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic \u2014 the plane around the sun\u2019s equator where all the planets orbited. Moving very, very fast it swung around the sun, looping around to shoot off at a new angle that sent it past the inner planets and then, eventually, back out into deep space.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know where it came from. Maybe somewhere around the star Vega. But yeah \u2014 it came from out there. Out there in the galaxy.\u201d As he warmed up, Sunny had to fight the urge to bounce up and down on the stage. This is where it got very interesting. \u201cIt passed through interstellar space \u2014 it might have been out there for a hundred thousand years or more. Then it very briefly passed through our solar system before heading back out into the dark. Our telescopes weren\u2019t great back then, and we barely got a look at it. But it changed \u2014 well, a whole lot of things in astronomy. It made us really think, for the first time, about what else was out there.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the screen, and \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s path traced a white curve around the sun. He tapped the screen again, and a second curve appeared.\n\n\u201cIn astronomy, if you see one specimen of a new type of object, you know you\u2019ll find more of them if you look. The universe is so big there are very few unique things in it. We had to assume it wasn\u2019t the only interstellar rock out there. Back in \u201917, KSpace was still working on launching their first rocket, but already they had a strong interest in astronomy. They set up a radio telescope survey to look for more I objects. About three years ago I took over that project. Specifically, I created a new search pattern that focused on the part of the sky where \u2018Oumuamua originated. I figured if one rock came from that direction, maybe more of them would come from the same place. It turns out I was right.\u201d\n\nThe second white curve traced almost exactly the same arc as the first. \u201cThis is 2I/2054 D1.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but beam out at his sparse audience. \u201cMy baby.\u201d\n\nHe turned and watched the white curves, entranced as always by the cosmic duet.\n\n\u201cIf \u2018Oumuamua was weird, so was 2I, and in all the same ways. It has the same deep-red color. It\u2019s the same basic cigar shape, about eight times as long as it is wide. That was enough to pique my interest. But then I used a light curve analysis to get a better idea of its size.\u201d\n\nA graphic representation of \u2018Oumuamua appeared as a small spindly shape floating in front of the screen. A tiny blur of low-resolution pixels. 2I appeared above it \u2014 and dwarfed it.\n\n\u201c2I is about three hundred and fifty times bigger than \u2018Oumuamua. Identical in almost every single way, except on a massively larger scale. I\u2019ve estimated it\u2019s about ten kilometers across and eighty kilometers long. And it\u2019s currently headed toward us, eating up twenty-six kilometers every second.\u201d\n\nSally Jansen coughed for his attention. \u201cThat sounds fast,\u201d she said. \u201cToo fast.\u201d\n\nSunny gave her a tentative smile. At least she was paying attention. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why 2I is super interesting. Both of them, \u2018Oumuamua and 2I, they came at us about the same speed. Interstellar speed, call it. Most comets, even the really fast ones, top out at about five kilometers per second. The fastest spacecraft ever built \u2014 Voyager 2 \u2014 is moving about fifteen kilometers a second. There\u2019s one difference, though. Comets and planets and everything natural will keep the same speed pretty much forever, right? We know the laws of physics, and how they apply to big, dumb objects moving through space. \u2018Oumuamua followed all those rules. It came in super fast. Then it sped up as it swung around the sun, which makes sense; it used the sun\u2019s gravity to get the slingshot effect, to speed itself up. Originally,\u201d he said, pointing at the white curves above his head, \u201cwe thought 2I would do the same thing. Swing around the sun, build up a good head of steam, and head back out for the stars, so fast we would barely get a look at it. That\u2019s what I was expecting \u2014 what everybody was expecting. Except then it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the screen. His heart was pounding in his chest. This was the thing he needed to explain. The reason he kept giving this presentation.\n\n\u201cIt slowed down,\u201d Stevens announced. \u201cDecelerated. The last time I checked, it was down to about twenty-one kilometers per second, and it\u2019s still slowing. It shouldn\u2019t be doing that. I mean, there are reasons why an astronomical body might decelerate, sure. Drag or a collision with another object or . . . whatever, but none of them fit. 2I wasn\u2019t acting like a normal space rock, but what did that mean? Then it went and answered the question for us. It changed course.\u201d\n\nOn the screen the white curve bent inward on itself, moving away from the sun. \u201cWith no physical explanation, it started moving in a direction we didn\u2019t expect.\u201d The white curve made a delicate, graceful arc toward the plane of the ecliptic \u2014 and the orbits of the planets. One planet in particular.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s headed towards Earth,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cIf it continues on its present course and deceleration, in about six months it\u2019ll pass inside the orbit of the moon. By that point it\u2019ll have slowed down to less than eleven kilometers per second. In other words, less than Earth\u2019s escape velocity.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Sunny said, \u201cthis looks like a classic Hohmann transfer orbit.\u201d He waved at the screen, and the trajectory continued as a dashed line. The view zoomed in so they could see the curve bending around the surface of Earth. \u201cThis is just speculation, but I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s going to eventually execute another course correction, one using very little delta-v. A minimum expenditure of thrust. With just a little nudge, it could enter a polar orbit of the Earth.\u201d\n\nJansen leaned forward in her seat. The AR simulation was good enough Sunny could see the white curves crisscrossing the black lenses of her sunglasses.\n\n\u201cComets and asteroids don\u2019t act like that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying \u2014\u201d\n\nSunny did bounce up and down a little then. He shoved his hands in his pockets because he didn\u2019t know what else to do with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a comet or an asteroid. It\u2019s a spaceship. It\u2019s a spaceship moving under its own power.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if it\u2019s coming from deep space \u2014 that means it\u2019s a starship,\u201d McAllister said, softly. \u201cAn alien craft.\u201d\n\nROY MCALLISTER, ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR FOR EXPLORATION AND OPERATIONS, NASA: We attempted to make contact with 2I every way we knew how. We had a team from the SETI Institute design a series of radio signals that would indicate our presence, our intelligence, and our desire to communicate. We used the most powerful radio transmitters in the world to send the signals, repeating the message hundreds of times a day. There was no response, not even an acknowledgment that the aliens had got our call. We needed to know \u2014 as soon as physically possible \u2014 what its intentions were. It wasn\u2019t an academic question. It was possible that 2I intended to take up orbit around Earth. It was also possible it was sent to crash right into us. An object that large, moving at that velocity, would wipe out all life on the planet. I took Dr. Stevens\u2019s presentation to every government scientific and political body that would listen. I found a lot of doors open to me \u2014 it didn\u2019t take an astrophysicist to understand how important this was.", "description": "In this excerpt from David Wellington\u2019s forthcoming science fiction novel The Last Astronaut, a disgraced astronaut is given a chance at redemption when an interstellar object is detected coming into our solar system.
