The law affects the age of sale for electronic nicotine products, and applies to 6,000 businesses throughout the state.\n\nBut enforcement of the law will focus on the retailers who sell tobacco and nicotine products, not the teens who break the law by purchasing the products, according to a report in the Baltimore Sun. Retailers that break the law face fines that escalate from $300 for a first offense to $3,000 for subsequent violations, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMaryland is the 18th state to raise the minimum age to buy tobacco to 21, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. This is important health concern because 94% \u201cof adult smokers had their first cigarette before turning 21, according to the American Lung Association.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to make it as difficult as possible for our young people to have access to nicotine products,\u201d Delegate Dereck Davis, the Democrat who sponsored the law, told the Sun.\n\nOnly military personnel who are over 18-years old but below the 21-year old threshold can continue to buy nicotine products. They must, however, utilize their military identification to continue to purchase these items.\n\nThe law passed the state General Assembly assembly by a vote of 101-35 in April after the initial passage in the state Senate. As part of this legislation, the Maryland Department of Health will implement random inspections of sites to check on compliance. According to the law, the department \u201cmay use an individual younger than age 21 to assist in conducting the inspections.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 255,000 Maryland residents who are 18, 19 and 20, will be affected by Tuesday\u2019s law.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "On Tuesday, Maryland will become the latest state to raise the age for buying cigarettes and other tobacco products.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/Marlboro.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
