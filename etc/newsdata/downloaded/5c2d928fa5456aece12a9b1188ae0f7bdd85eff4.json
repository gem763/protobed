The Mets scored five runs in the top of the ninth to lead 10-4 before the Nats rallied all the way back in the bottom of the inning, capping the rally with a three-run, game-ending homer from Kurt Suzuki. The Nationals/Expos franchise had never won a game after trailing by at least six runs in the ninth or later.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard to do even in a Little League game,\u201d said dejected Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo.\n\nRight-hander Zack Wheeler (9-7, 4.41 ERA), who is 0-2 with a 7.94 ERA in four starts against Washington this season, is set to start for New York. He\u2019ll face righty Anibal Sanchez (8-6, 3.80).\n\nCHECK HIM\n\nAstros center fielder George Springer was being examined for a head injury after running into the wall and being carted off the field at Milwaukee. The 2017 World Series MVP was walking around the clubhouse after a 4-2 loss and manager AJ Hinch said Springer was day to day and OK to travel back to Houston with the team.\n\nSpringer was hurt making a catch on a ball hit by Ryan Braun. Springer fell to the ground and grabbed the back of his head after losing his glove.\n\nAstros personnel attended to him, and after a lengthy delay, Springer sat upright in the cart driven by Miller Park emergency attendants.\n\nAfter a day off, the AL West-leading Astros host Seattle.\n\nSCARY MOMENT\n\nRays infielder Eric Sogard had his helmet and glasses knocked off by Baltimore reliever Paul Fry\u2019s pitch Tuesday night. Sogard was able off walk off the field after a brief examination by trainers and said the ball struck his shoulder first, then his helmet and nose.\n\n\u201cIt busted my nose a little bit,\u201d Sogard said. \u201cI feel like that was a best-case scenario. The way it turned out, I feel very, very lucky.\u201d\n\nA BRONX TALE\n\nScott Heineman hit his first career homer on Tuesday night, and the Texas outfielder got a little help in retrieving the souvenir at Yankee Stadium.\n\nAs Heineman rounded the bases in the ninth inning, a ball was thrown back onto the field - a ballboy scooped it up and tossed it to a fan. Yankees PA announcer Paul Olden told the crowd that it was Heineman\u2019s first career homer and he\u2019d like to have the ball.\n\nTurned out the ball that was thrown back was not actually the souvenir ball. But Heineman eventually got the right ball back by making an exchange with a fan from New Jersey.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s something you dream of,\u201d Heineman said. \u201cFor it to happen here, it\u2019s just funny the way the world works, because both my parents are from New York. So, I\u2019ve got family here, my dad\u2019s side of the family is all in the stands, and it was pretty cool.\u201d\n\nHeineman\u2019s older brother, Tyler, recently got called up by Miami and is ready to make his major league debut. Their parents were in Pittsburgh to watch Tyler with the Marlins while his sisters, and an aunt and a few cousins attended the game in the Bronx.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors today:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/mets_nationals_baseball_42986_c0-164-3910-2443_s1770x1032.jpg?5aae93a4087b764f35bbc86f1dc8e238d84f7dc0"}
