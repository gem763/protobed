Bahati, 29, was 14 years younger, 6 inches taller and possessed a 7-inch reach advantage.\n\nBut none of that mattered once Manhoef (31-14-1 MMA, 4-3 BMMA) threw a hard right hand straight down the pipe. It wasn\u2019t so much that the punch landed flush as it simply landed with enough force while Bahati (9-4 MMA, 1-1 BMMA) threw a kick, catching him off balance and dropping him to the mat. From there, Manhoef initially pounced looking for a finish but quickly aborted and settled down instead.\n\nOnce Bahati looked to transition into full guard, that\u2019s when Manhoef let his hands go, landing several hard punches to force the referee stoppage at the 2:29 mark.\n\nWOW! @team_manhoef gets the job done in the very first round, stopping @yannick_bahati with some nasty ground and pound! What a finish here at #BellatorMilan.

I know that I\u2019m strong. My defense is good. And I was prepared for this,\u201d Manhoef said. \u201cYou know, I can knock people out from standup and on the ground.\u201d\n\nWith Manhoef now on a two-fight winning streak after both wins coming this year, the question is whether or not his fighting career is over. All he could say for sure is that this was the last fight on his Bellator conference.\n\nHe sounds like a man who wants to keep on fighting.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m gonna look forward, because I feel good. I\u2019m 43 years old, but I still feel good,\u201d Manhoef said. \u201cThis thing is like gold for me. But we have to negotiate first, so we\u2019ll see. \u2026\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t come back, I\u2019ve enjoyed people for a long time. If this is my last fight, to finish like this, I\u2019m very honored for you guys.
