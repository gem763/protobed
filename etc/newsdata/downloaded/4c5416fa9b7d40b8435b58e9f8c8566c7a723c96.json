How?\n\nElizabeth Strout didn't really plan to return to the world of Olive Kitteridge, but her character had other ideas. Strout won a Pulitzer Prize for her 2008 novel that spun together 13 connected stories of love, loss and loneliness in the small town of Crosby, Maine.\n\nYears later, Strout was sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Norway, and she suddenly saw Olive \"very vividly, driving into the marina.\" Strout immediately started writing a story that would become the first in her new collection: Olive, Again.\n\nDiving back into Olive's life \"wasn't a difficult decision \u2014 it wasn't even a decision,\" Strout says. It was clear: \"We've got more to say about you.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn her mother, now 92, who taught expository writing\n\nShe encouraged me to write from a very, very young age. I mean, honestly, as soon as I could write sentences she bought me those notebooks with the big lines in them and told me to write down what I had done that day. And so I did. So from a very, very young age I thought in terms of sentences and she would give me books to read. ... She was very, very, very encouraging about making me a writer.\n\nAuthor Interviews 'My Ears Are Open': Novelist Elizabeth Strout Finds Inspiration In Everyday Life 'My Ears Are Open': Novelist Elizabeth Strout Finds Inspiration In Everyday Life Listen \u00b7 32:56 32:56\n\nOn imagining other people's stories\n\nI have observed people from my earliest memory. I have really, really watched and listened very, very carefully and I have always, always been propelled forward by the question of: What does it feel like to be another person? Because we don't know. When you think about it, we never know. We're only inside ourselves and so that ability to intuit what might be in somebody else's mind is really something that I have been amazingly interested in from a very young age. So other people's stories are what I write.\n\nOn meeting her husband at one of her book appearances\n\nHe was in the audience ... and he asked a question. I couldn't see him because of the lights. But I just heard a deep voice say, 'You know, I'm from Maine.' And so I thought, well, everybody in New York claims some connection to Maine \u2014 you know, he probably went to camp there or something. And so I [asked] 'Oh, what part of Maine are you from?' and he said: 'Lisbon Falls.' And I realized: 'Oh, he really is from Maine.' So afterwards he was the first in line and that was that.\n\nOn how much Olive's flinty personality is shaped by being from Maine\n\nI don't know that we can separate the two that much. She's very, very much from Maine and I sort of think of her as a barnacle, you know, clinging to the rocks of Maine.\n\nOn her feelings about Olive\n\nI love Olive. I mean, I made her, so I love her. But I understand that many people don't. That's fine. ...\n\nI'm perfectly aware that she comes from my imagination \u2014 it's not like I am channeling her or anything like that \u2014 but she's from my imagination and yet she is very, very distinct. And therefore my job to write about her accurately is to make sure that I don't hold her back. I let her behave as badly as I think she would. But at the same time I love her. ...\n\nOne of the most pleasant things for me about writing is that I suspend judgment on all my characters and it's so freeing. It's just a wonderfully freeing thing to realize I'm not there to judge them. I'm just there to report on what they're doing.\n\nOn why Olive resonates with readers\n\nI think it is because she's just so complicated. I think honestly that many of us are complicated \u2014 maybe not as complicated as Olive \u2014 but there are enough complications within Olive for people to respond to her in a variety of ways and to recognize some piece of truthfulness that can touch them as well.\n\nOn whether Olive is still with her\n\nEvery character that I write \u2014 honestly they kind of stay in my ribs somehow. So ... she's stuck along with the rest of them in my ribs. So, yes and no. She's still a part of my life. She'll always be a part of my life. ... She is very interesting company, actually. She really is.\n\nOn whether there's another Olive book coming\n\nThe truth is I have absolutely no idea. I mean, I would say no. But how do I know? She showed up again one time, so who knows?\n\nHanna Bola\u00f1os and Samantha Balaban produced and edited this interview for broadcast.
