Her bed is empty. The quiet is deafening. Adelaide left us early Saturday.\n\n\u2018She went peacefully in her mother\u2019s arms, surrounded by love. Finally, she is free from pain + seizures but leaves our hearts shattered. We love you so much Adelaideybug and forever after.\u2019\n\nThe family told People in a statement: \u2018The Cervantes family is heartbroken to announce that their baby girl Adelaide Grace passed away early Saturday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She was held in the loving arms of her family as she peacefully achieves the \u201ccalm\u201d for which they\u2019ve been searching for so long.

The skills you have lost will not be regained. I am so sorry that your body has betrayed you in this way. It is not fair and it really, really, really sucks. But somehow, I think you know this already, in your own capacity. You\u2019ve been, quite literally, screaming at me \u2013 trying to get me to listen to you. Of course I heard you, but listening was too painful. I\u2019m listening now, though, my love and I will be with you every step of the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018As we make this transition I will be trying to understand what you want and need to keep you as comfortable as possible. Please forgive the extra pictures and videos I\u2019ll be taking, I know I\u2019ll want to hold on to all the memories I can. It\u2019s the things I can\u2019t capture that I will miss the most: the way you smell, and not just after a bath, but your sweet, \u201cjust you\u201d smell. The feel of your forever baby soft skin and how tightly you squeeze my fingers even still. The way your hair feels when I run my fingers through it trying to comfort you and the weight of your body against mine in those rare moments when you let me snuggle you.\u2019\n\nSpeaking to People days before Adelaide\u2019s passing, Miguel \u2013 who, with Kelly, works with Citizens United For Research In Epilepsy \u2013 said: \u2018I\u2019m never going to ask why these things happen and oh, I\u2019d give away all that I have to have Adelaide here. But without her condition, we would have never met the strong and amazing people we are surrounded by right now.\n\n\u2018We have been giving this platform to talk about Infantile Spasms and epilepsy. And we have been given this platform to tell people about Adelaide. And that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel will be taking a break from his role in Hamilton.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
