But the administration has sought to halt the fighting.\n\n'PERMANENT' TURKEY-SYRIA CEASE-FIRE POSSIBLE AS TEMPORARY PEACE AGREEMENT ENDS, PENCE SAYS\n\nThe cease-fire required Kurdish forces formerly allied with the U.S. against the Islamic State group to move out of a roughly 20-mile zone on the Turkish border. With Kurdish forces out of the zone, Turkey will halt its assault, Trump said.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that nearly all U.S. troops will be leaving Syria, but some will remain to safeguard oil fields. Russian forces have already begun joint patrols with Turkish forces along the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Bennett warned that the security situation is so tenuous, that even great numbers of American soldiers will be needed in the future.\n\n\u201cI predict that the number of troops who were removed, and many of them went to Iraq and didn\u2019t come home, will soon be greater,\u201d Bennett said.\n\n\"The situation is gonna blow up again.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Ronn Blitzer, Andrew O\u2019Reilly contributed to this report.", "description": "Following President Trump announcing a lift of sanctions on Ankara, Fox News contributor Bill Bennett told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d on Thursday \u201cI think this was a mistake.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-24-at-12.38.25-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
