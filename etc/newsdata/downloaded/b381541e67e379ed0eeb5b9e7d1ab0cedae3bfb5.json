The study will then put forward recommendations to promote both biodiversity and economic prosperity.\n\nThe study, commissioned by the Treasury under the former chancellor Philip Hammond, is an attempt by the government to show that Britain is at the forefront of protecting the environment. It also comes after Theresa May committed the government to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nQ&A Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? Show Hide China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.\n\nClimate campaigners have criticised the government for failing to take enough action to tackle the scale of the crisis posed by global heating.\n\nThe chancellor, Sajid Javid, unveiled his spending priorities for the year ahead at a review this month, with Greenpeace UK warning the government had fallen \u201cwoefully short\u201d of providing anywhere near enough funding to meet its net-zero target.\n\nJavid said: \u201cProtecting nature\u2019s biodiversity has both environmental and economic benefits. That\u2019s why we asked Prof Dasgupta to carry out the first review of its kind into this area, and I\u2019m delighted Sir David Attenborough has agreed to be an ambassador.\u201d", "description": "Broadcaster will act as ambassador for government review into global costs and risks of habitat loss", "authors": ["Richard Partington", "Charlie Gardner", "Claire Wordley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e939ad687dd4ce098249f0931b5aa83fbc438675/1360_4_5807_3484/master/5807.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4dc71c31ebb53491289c37829a2a95ae", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
