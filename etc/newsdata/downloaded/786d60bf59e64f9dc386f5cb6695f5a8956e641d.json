REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBrent crude futures fell 46 cents to $62.64 a barrel by 0104 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 dropped to $56.89, down 40 cents.\n\nBoth prices have fallen to their lowest since before the attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Sept. 14.\n\n\u201cWhat really pulled the rug from underneath oil was Donald Trump\u2019s comments on trade last night.... He\u2019s still maintaining quite a belligerent position,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA.\n\nTrump criticized China\u2019s trade practices at the United National General Assembly on Tuesday and said he would not accept a \u201cbad deal\u201d in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nChina is the world\u2019s largest oil importer and second-largest crude user while the United States is the largest consumer.\n\nTrump also said he saw a path to peace with Iran even as he denounced Iran for \u201cbloodlust\u201d, cooling geopolitical premiums in oil prices.\n\nOil rallied last week following a crippling attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil installations that has disrupted supplies from the world\u2019s top exporter. To meet its supply obligations to Saudi refineries overseas, Saudi Aramco is buying oil from other Middle East producers.\n\n\u201cThe risk premium has died off for now,\u201d Halley said, adding that the main driver for oil markets now is trade uncertainty that could impact demand.\n\nPrices were also weighed down by an unexpected build in U.S. crude inventories last week.\n\nU.S. crude inventories rose 1.4 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday, compared with analysts\u2019 forecasts of a 200,000-barrel drawdown.\n\nOfficial government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released later today.", "description": "Oil prices fell for a second day on Wednesday on worries about falling fuel demand after U.S. President Donald Trump's comments doused optimism over China-U.S. trade talks and reignited concerns on global economic growth.", "authors": ["Florence Tan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433570721&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O03V", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
