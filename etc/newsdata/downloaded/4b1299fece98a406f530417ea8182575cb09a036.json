REUTERS/I-Hwa Cheng\n\nThe switch, just days after the Solomon Islands cut ties with Taiwan, deals a fresh blow to President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January, as it takes to seven the tally of allies lost to China since she took office in 2016.\n\nTaiwan has terminated diplomatic ties with Kiribati and will immediately shut its embassy there, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters in Taipei.\n\n\u201cAccording to information obtained by Taiwan, the Chinese government has already promised to provide full funds for the procurement of several airplanes and commercial ferries, thus luring Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations,\u201d he added.\n\nChina was trying to \u201csuppress and reduce Taiwan\u2019s international presence\u201d and \u201cultimately destroy Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d Wu said.\n\n\u201cIt is blatantly obvious that the Chinese government, by creating these diplomatic incidents, seeks to manipulate public opinion in Taiwan, influence Taiwan\u2019s upcoming presidential and legislative elections, and undermine its democratic processes.\u201d\n\nThe Kiribati president\u2019s office and China\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nChina claims Taiwan as its territory, and says the democratic island has no right to formal ties with any country.\n\nSince Tsai took office, China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan, by flying regular bomber patrols around the island, for example. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, a red line for Beijing.\n\nAid requested by Kiribati from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, said a senior official in Taiwan with direct knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity.\n\nCiting intelligence gathered by Taipei, the source said China aimed to peel away more of Taiwan\u2019s allies before the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cThat worries several countries in the region, including the United States and Australia,\u201d said the official, citing fears over China\u2019s growing influence on the so-called \u201csecond island chain\u201d in the Pacific.\n\nKiribati is the seventh country to drop Taiwan as a diplomatic ally since 2016, following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, El Salvador and the Solomon Islands.\n\nIn a statement, Taiwan\u2019s main opposition, the China-friendly Kuomintang party, urged Tsai\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to review its policy toward Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe DPP should examine the real cause behind the breaking of ties and propose a practical solution,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIt should not continue to shift the responsibility to the former ally, the mainland authorities or the opposition party.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Lagoons can be seen from a plane as it flies above Kiritimati Island, part of the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati, April 5, 2016.
