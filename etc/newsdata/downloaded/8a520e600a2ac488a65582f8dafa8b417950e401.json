IAG has started to implement this in its claims processes, with Jamieson saying the company expects over time that up to 20 new journeys would be created.\n\n\"Rather than selling your insurance through a digital property through NRMA, Coles, CGU, and then making you phone us up and do everything analogue, we want to empower our customers so you can do everything yourselves,\" Jamieson said.\n\n\"And when you need to call us, it'll be for complex and high value transactions like a major car crash\u2026we find people only call us because they can't get it done themselves online. That's very much the driver.\"\n\nEnhancing the mobile experience is another consideration for the company, as is having more control of the end-to-end customer experience when it comes to services such as car repairs, Jamieson said.\n\n\"We need to have complete records of customer interaction, so when you call, we know what SMS have been sent, we know updates you've been given, as oppose to these black outs and silos of information. We're trying to bring all of that together \u2026 so there's a complete record of the customer interactions, and nothing is falling through the cracks and there's no phone tag,\" he said.\n\nJamieson also believes there's the potential of using Internet of Things to proactively inform customers about potential dangers and prevent claims.\n\n\"Most people don't know that most of our expensive claims come from broken hoses from under your sink. After a few years it explodes because it gives up and there's water everywhere. We have looked at programs where we can proactively engage customers to change out those hoses so we can avoid claims,\" he said.\n\nRelated content\n\nIAG warns Australia's insurance sector about smart automation future\n\nSmart automation is more than just about robotics process automation.\n\nDevelopers need to be developing: Service NSW claims shift in tech stack can help\n\nThe one-stop shop for citizen service delivery believes the move to a \"low-touch or no-touch\" environment will free up time for its developers.\n\nFujitsu opens digital transformation facility at Macquarie University\n\nThe first Fujitsu DTC in Australia will be a space for current and future customers to co-create solutions with the Japanese conglomerate.\n\nADHA to overhaul underlying infrastructure of Australia's health services\n\nThe government agency has its eyes on a future that includes AI, blockchain, and IoT.", "description": "The insurance giant believes the digital transformation will allow it to expand its product range beyond insurance.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/18/9cf4a30f-26be-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/1a0e9df99aa7c11a3bcdfe1a3fc1d8f8/tasict-calls-for-transparent-tasmanian-call-centre-policy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
