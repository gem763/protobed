The fourth \u2014 dark-haired, charismatic, braless Jacy \u2014 has wealthy parents. She lives in the sorority where the three guys work as hashers, serving and clearing up after meals. They all fall in love with Jacy. She\u2019s engaged, so there seems no immediate chance for them. Yet, she never speaks of her fiance, so who knows \u2014 especially when one night she gives each of them in turn a serious impassioned kiss.\n\nThe novel begins 44 years later, when Lincoln arrives on Martha\u2019s Vineyard to sell the house he inherited from his mother. He\u2019s invited Teddy and Mickey to join him on a last convivial weekend together, recalling a similar event in 1971, when they were newly graduated from Minerva and Jacy was with them.\n\nSince then they had gone their separate ways. Lincoln became a commercial real estate broker in Las Vegas. Teddy, often subject to mood disorders, is an editor and small-time publisher in upstate New York. Staying true to his vocation, Mickey\u2019s a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll guitarist with his own band on Cape Cod.\n\nAs for Jacy, she\u2019s gone. She left that long-ago weekend while the guys were still sleeping, leaving a note saying she couldn\u2019t bear goodbyes. She was never seen again. The police got involved but found nothing.\n\nAs he arrives on the island, Teddy thinks he spots her waiting on the dock. He\u2019s wrong. But inevitably she is on all their minds. Lincoln decides to noodle around to look for leads. It becomes a bit of a mission for him, and for Teddy, too. Eventually the truth is revealed \u2014 not just the truth about what happened to her after she left the Vineyard house, but about her life before Minerva.\n\nThe lives of Lincoln, Teddy and eventually Mickey are also revealed. Lincoln got lucky. He married one of Jacy\u2019s sorority sisters, they had good careers and six kids, and now have grandchildren. Teddy\u2019s life has been emotionally rockier. He\u2019s struggled to keep on keel. Mickey has had his problems, too.\n\nAs readers discover, this pattern is not new. It is dramatized soon after they reach Minerva, when they watch the first Vietnam draft lottery. Mickey\u2019s birthday is drawn ninth. He\u2019s going to get drafted. Teddy\u2019s and Lincoln\u2019s dates came safely later.\n\nThat\u2019s chance. And as this title of the novel forewarns and its tale illustrates, chance plays a big part in life. The four central characters (and bit players also) are subject to accidents. They get lucky breaks and bad breaks plus inheritances of different sorts.\n\n\u201cKind of makes you wonder,\u201d reflects Lincoln. \u201cIf there\u2019s such as thing as do-overs, if we all had a bunch of chances at life, would they all be different?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s 66 \u2014 a time of life when thoughts about one\u2019s earlier years invariably occur. Author Richard Russo is an example. His recent books have included a memoir \u201cElsewhere\u201d focusing on his mother\u2019s life as well as his own, and \u201cTrajectory,\u201d a collection of stories about middle-age people, exploring the personal history that has shaped their lives.\n\nIn \u201cChances Are,\u201d the contemplative Teddy has thought about chance and decided that if you look backward on your life, \u201cCharacter was destiny \u2026 Mickey\u2019s number on the lottery would always be 9, Teddy\u2019s always 322. Why? Because \u2026 well, that\u2019s just how the story went.\u201d But he thinks it better to look forward. Then, he decides, even if free will is an illusion, it\u2019s necessary to give life meaning. \u201cSometimes it did feel like the fix was in, but what if it was only partial?\u201d His own life was shaped by terrible early experiences, yet he finds hope.\n\nRichard Russo won early acclaim for his portrayal of working-class lives in the Northeastern mill towns he knew from his childhood in upstate New York. His later works have featured bourgeois characters, but he writes about their lives and anxieties \u2014 especially those of men \u2014 with equal skill. Not that the working class have entirely disappeared from his work. In \u201cChances Are,\u201d Mickey\u2019s dad is a shining example.\n\nJacy is a less successful character: so conventionally \u201cdramatic\u201d that unlike her male friends she is a literary trope rather than a fully realized character, and this saps some credibility from their fascination with her.\n\nNonetheless, Richard Russo\u2019s lucidity and intelligence make this an enticing novel, unputdownable toward the end when the truth about Jacy is finally revealed.\n\n\u2022 Claire Hopley is a writer and editor in Amherst, Mass.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nCHANCES ARE: A NOVEL\n\nBy Richard Russo\n\nAlfred A.
