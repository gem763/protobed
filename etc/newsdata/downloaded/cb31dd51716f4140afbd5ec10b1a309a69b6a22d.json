Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nClinton has not responded, but her spokesman, Nick Merrill, told CNN, \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d\n\nMerrill, in an interview Saturday, said Clinton was \u201cnot saying Americans are Russian spies, but that Russia has found ways to take advantage and is not being held responsible by anyone in government.\u201d\n\nFew outside of Clinton\u2019s immediate orbit defended her comments. The closest anyone came was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who retweeted Gabbard\u2019s reaction to Clinton with a viral gif from the June debate when he glanced \u201cside eyed\u201d \u2014 a look that often conveys shock or disdain \u2014 at another candidate.\n\nAD\n\nOn the campaign trail, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) refused to engage, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure Secretary Clinton can defend herself.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut two of the nonpoliticians in the Democratic primary, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and author Marianne Williamson, sided with Gabbard.\n\nYang tweeted that Gabbard, a veteran, \u201cdeserves much more respect and thanks than this.\u201d Williamson accused the Democratic establishment of \u201csmearing women it finds inconvenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe character assassination of women who don\u2019t toe the party line will backfire. Stay strong @TulsiGabbard. You deserve respect and you have mine,\u201d Williamson tweeted.\n\nNotably, Clinton \u2014 who made the comments on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, a former adviser to President Barack Obama \u2014 never used Gabbard\u2019s name. But Gabbard is the only female candidate in the Democratic primary who has been accused of having ties to Russia.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nAD\n\nGabbard has repeatedly ruled out running as a third-party candidate. But she has been courted to run in the general election outside the Democratic Party by activists who believe the two-party system is corrupt and should be cast aside.\n\nStein has suggested in the past that Gabbard \u201cshould become a Green\u201d because her comments were \u201csimilar to our message.\u201d\n\nIn the podcast interview, Clinton also accused Stein, who won more votes in several states than Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Clinton, of being a tool of the Russians.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s a Russian asset, I mean, totally,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear why Clinton initiated this fight, the bad blood between her and Gabbard goes back to 2016, when Gabbard quit her post as a Democratic National Committee vice chair so she could endorse Clinton\u2019s primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont.\n\nGabbard was back on the campaign trail Saturday, holding two town hall meetings in Iowa, including one in the town of Clinton.\n\nMichael Scherer and David Weigel contributed to this story.\n\nAD", "description": "Hillary Clinton suggested that Rep.
