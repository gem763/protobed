That\u2019s all I have to say about that.\u201d\n\nThe Welsh Rugby Union had earlier stressed that Biggar was \u201csymptom-free\u201d and had been cleared by an independent expert after passing return-to-play protocols.\n\nThe 30-year-old failed a head injury assessment after taking a blow in Wales\u2019s win over Australia on September, but was passed to play against Fiji 10 days later.\n\nHowever, he suffered a nasty aerial collision with team-mate Liam Williams during the game in Oita and had to leave the field once again.\n\nWales coach Warren Gatland said Biggar \u201cfelt better after the (Fiji) game, it was clear\u201d and the \u201cright people\u201d had been consulted to get him properly scanned and assessed.\n\n\u201cWe feel that we\u2019ve gone through that due diligence and making sure we\u2019ve covered all the bases in terms of Dan,\u201d Gatland said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously done all the protocols and been fit for three or four days in terms of having passed those so we are obviously taking all the proper precautions from our point of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s desperate as a player to play,\u201d Gatland said, adding that the Wales management had previously dealt with multiple-concussion cases, including a 2015 controversy involving winger George North.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure if it does happen, if he gets a knock in the next few games or the next couple of months, obviously there would probably be a different course of action. But he\u2019s very confident that he\u2019s 100 percent,\u201d Gatland said.\n\nConcussion has become a major issue in several sports including rugby, and prompted a crackdown on high tackles which has resulted in a rash of red cards at the World Cup.", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Wales fly-half Dan Biggar would have been ruled out of the Rugby World Cup quarter-final with France under French concussion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/18/562d3b_wales-fly-dan-biggar-has-passed-fit-head-injury-french-concussion-rules-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
