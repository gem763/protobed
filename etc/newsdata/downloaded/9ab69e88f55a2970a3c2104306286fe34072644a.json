It is responsible for about 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to Oxfam.\n\nSome brands are attempting to cut waste and be more sustainable, with mainstay brands like Badgley Mischka making shifts in how they produce their garments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a different business than it was, even five years ago. The factories we use are no-waste manufacturing plants, where everything is recycled,\u201d said designer Mark Badgley.\n\nStudio 189 last week in New York showed its collection of African-inspired naturally dyed clothes produced with the collaboration of local communities in Ghana.\n\n\u201cWe need to have this conversation in the fashion industry more than anything,\u201d said actress Rosario Dawson, co-founder of\n\nthe venture, along with former Bottega Veneta executive Abrima Erwiah.

It could find a new life. It\u2019s about recreating, reimagining, recycling. It\u2019s about basically getting creative with things that usually would be discarded,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout 97% of clothing is outsourced for production in poor nations where factory owners compete on price, leading to discarded clothing piling up in landfills and harmful chemical run-off from factories, according to Andrew Morgan, director of the 2015 documentary \u201cThe True Cost.\u201d", "description": "Fashion is supposed to make you look and feel good, and the apparel industry is finally making efforts to have the same effect on the planet.", "authors": ["Alicia Powell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
