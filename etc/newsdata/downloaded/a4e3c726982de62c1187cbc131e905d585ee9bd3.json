If exerting more influence over the direction of both apps by installing Facebook executives wasn\u2019t enough, now the social network giant is going to add \u201cFacebook\u201d to their names. Instagram will soon become \u201cInstagram from Facebook\u201d and WhatsApp will turn into \u201cWhatsApp from Facebook.\u201d The company already follows this approach with its Workplace app. The Information first reported the planned changes, which Facebook confirmed directly.\n\nThe new titles will appear in the title for both apps in Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play. On your device\u2019s home screen, the name for each will mercifully remain the same (for now). But it\u2019s also very likely that you\u2019ll see \u201cfrom Facebook\u201d on the splash screen for both apps. Facebook already made this exact change with Oculus.\n\n\u201cWe want to be clearer about the products and services that are part of Facebook,\u201d a spokesperson told The Information. Mark Zuckerberg has already unveiled his grand vision of a connected (and end-to-end encrypted) messaging system between Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nBut some level of separation from Facebook, however artificial, has served both apps well with users. As Facebook has sagged in popularity with younger consumers, both Instagram and WhatsApp have soared.\n\nThe flex of control is also surprising in that it comes just as Facebook faces more antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, which is said to be looking into the company\u2019s history of acquisitions. The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported that the FTC is examining whether Facebook\u2019s many acquisitions were made with the goal of squashing competition. Now, two of the company\u2019s most significant purchases will have Facebook stamped right onto their names.", "description": "In its latest power play over two massively popular apps that it owns, Facebook will add \"from Facebook\" to the titles of both Instagram and WhatsApp.", "authors": ["Chris Welch", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zby9wIisIohMoVjw8l_JVDh9y4=/0x166:2040x1234/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11560021/akrales_180614_1777_0229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
