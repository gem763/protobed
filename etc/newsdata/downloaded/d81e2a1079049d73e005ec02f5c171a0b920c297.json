She recently started posting photos again of both my children, without asking, and I know she still remembers my request because she complained about it several times.\n\nThese are just a few examples. We used to get along when I was younger, because I did everything they told me to without question. But eventually I grew a backbone, and they're not happy.\n\nMy brother and his family cut my parents off three years ago for similar reasons \u2014 constantly giving their unsolicited opinion, going against the way my brother and his wife wanted to raise their kids, and getting extremely offended when called out on their toxic behavior.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRather than try to learn from that, they treat me and my kids however they want as compensation for what they lost.\n\nWhen one of my sisters tried to approach them, my parents blamed her for the problem, talked about her behind her back and had little to do with her for over a year.\n\nI feel so much anxiety about the situation, because I know my children love them and deserve to have grandparents around, if possible. But I have no idea how to have a positive relationship with people who make me feel so upset all the time and who deny any wrongdoing on their part. What would you do in this situation?\n\n\u2014 Exhausted\n\nExhausted: They minimize your child\u2019s food allergy? The visit is over. You leave, or you ask them to leave. (Sweet holy nuts, what is wrong with these people?)\n\nAD\n\nThey yell when you ban germy kisses? Then the visit is over.\n\nAD\n\nThey slip your child a predinner cookie? Then the visit is over.\n\nThey post photos of your children? They take them down or they receive no more photos of your children.\n\nYour mother says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take you to Disney World!\u201d You say on the spot: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Pooh Bear, that\u2019s not true \u2014 I don\u2019t know why Grandma said that.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because, judging by the pathological behavior you describe, they don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d their grandchildren. If they liked the kids, then they\u2019d care about their well-being, yes? So would people who genuinely cared for the kids do things deliberately to undermine you and your husband? Your parents are actively damaging these kids\u2019 very emotional foundation: the parent-child bond. Wow.\n\nAD\n\nWhat your kids \u201cdeserve\u201d is protection from manipulators and other sick influences.\n\nSo you are the new sheriff, and you take no bull. Zero. Let them either respect your rules or feel the proverbial butt-thump of the door on their way out. It\u2019s learn or lose.\n\nAD\n\nWhat your parents apparently do like is the booster effect your kids have on their ego and self-image. They give cookies and over-promise trips and post pictures, why? Not for your kids\u2019 benefits, but for their own, to be seen as Fairy Grandparents.\n\nTherefore, if you\u2019re balking \u2014 or if anyone\u2019s harrumphing \u2014 because it\u2019s \u201cjust a cookie,\u201d then you need to remind yourself: \u201cJust a cookie\u201d also works as a great argument for your mother not to give a treat she was explicitly asked not to give.\n\nAD\n\nDon\u2019t be shy about running these possibilities by a skilled family therapist.\n\nYou\u2019ll be in your brother\u2019s position \u2014 soon \u2014 if your parents keep trying to undermine you even as you deny them such opportunities.\n\nIn the meantime, though, maybe it\u2019s not the worst thing to be in your sister\u2019s position: Tell Mom and Dad explicitly you won\u2019t stand for their disrespect of your and your husband\u2019s authority as parents. Maybe they\u2019ll see fit to reward you, too, with a year\u2019s worth of relative peace.\n\nWrite to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.
