However the Democrat-held House was hesitant to pass its proposed $733 billion budget because some liberal members insisted that the 2.3% funding increase from the previous fiscal year was too high.\n\nDespite their differences, both sides of the Capitol have approved a massive $2.7 trillion two-year budget deal that sets a $738 billion defense budget for next year, $12 billion below the Senate\u2019s proposed increase.\n\nMembers of the House are expected to fight for language that would restrict the use of defense funds for military force against Iran.\n\nIn a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate armed services committees as Congress departed for recess last month, a bipartisan group of 28 lawmakers argued that \u201cthe risk of the U.S. entering into war with Iran without authorization remains acute \u2026 [and] the final conference report for the FY 2020 NDAA must include the bipartisan amendment to prohibit an unauthorized and unconstitutional war with Iran.\u201d\n\nBut many Republicans, led by Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have staunchly opposed the amendment to the defense policy bill because it restricts the president\u2019s war authority.\n\nDespite momentum to bring down the hammer on several U.S. competitors, including China, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Congress should be looking at the bigger picture, analysts say.\n\n\u201cHow to mitigate and control great-power rivalry without risking war \u2014 to me, that\u2019s issue No. 1 where Congress can and should do more,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hanlon said.\n\nTackling other issues\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act will be the priority, but both chambers say other defense issues are looming as Congress reassembles, including clashes over policy toward key adversaries such as Russia.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Risch, Idaho Republican, said in an interview as he departed Capitol Hill for the annual summer break that \u201c[Russia\u2019s] list of sins is as long as your arm, and I think that people are just fed up with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest on the committee\u201d to \u201ctake some action\u201d against Russia for human rights and military violations that have been committed on their behalf, he said.\n\nAnalysts welcomed the renewed push on Capitol Hill to call out Moscow\u2019s violations regardless of an improved relationship between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cThe continued use of sanctions against offending entities and individuals will likely continue,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Hanlon said.\n\n\u201cCongress could, however, also hold hearings on the long-term relationship with Russia and what, if anything, can be done about it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe relationship hit a snag last week when Moscow reportedly denied visas to several members of the Senate committee who planned a visit to Moscow to meet with government officials and various business leaders.\n\nCongress has taken a bigger role in foreign policy matters because lawmakers have questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s sometimes disruptive approach.\n\nJust days before the August recess, the Senate Armed Services Committee renewed efforts to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia for what critics say are a continuing string of human rights violations. Mr. Trump vetoed a similar bill earlier this year, and Mr. Risch insists the latest bill will not get past the president\u2019s desk.\n\nSens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, and Robert Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, are pushing legislation that would impose some of the harshest sanctions on Russia for its involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and aggression against Ukraine. A similar bill failed to pass last year.\n\nThe Mexico border \u2014 and the Trump administration\u2019s use of troops and Defense Department dollars to beef up security there \u2014 continue to roil lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Democrats slammed Mr. Trump\u2019s Tuesday announcement that he intends to use emergency powers to transfer $3.6 billion from the military\u2019s facilities budget and put it toward building more of his border wall.\n\nSen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that the move shows Mr. Trump \u201cis willing to take funds from our troops and disaster victims and divert them to try to protect his political right flank. And ultimately, that could put Americans at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just an attempt to shift funding, it\u2019s a bid to shift power away from Congress to the president,\u201d Mr. Reed said.\n\nMr. Risch said he intends to focus on policy issues he knows the president will approve but his goal is to make as much of a tangible impact on improving the global standing of the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 200 countries, there\u2019s all kinds of things out there that need to be done,\u201d the chairman said, \u201cso we\u2019ll be looking for somewhere where we can actually make some progress.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The House and Senate are gearing up for several major battles over defense policy, with the Trump administration's use of Pentagon money for a Mexico border wall only making it harder to reconcile the differences in rival versions of the massive, must-pass 2020 National Defense Authorization Act.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Lauren Meier"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/01/22/Trump_Budget_Battle_72536.jpg-93070_c0-0-1678-978_s1770x1032.jpg?58c923ce59a3a42d93df7cab5d502cd280bf412f"}
