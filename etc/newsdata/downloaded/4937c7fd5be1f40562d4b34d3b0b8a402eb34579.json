The decision will be appealed and is widely expected to reach the Supreme Court.\n\n[Read our explainer on the Harvard affirmative action lawsuit.]\n\nThe plaintiff, Students for Fair Admissions, which represents a group of Asian-American students rejected by Harvard. Led by Edward Blum, a conservative activist who waged previous battles against affirmative action, the students accused the college of violating federal civil rights law by holding Asian-Americans, who as a group get better test scores and grades than other races, to a higher standard. Harvard did this, they said, in part by downgrading applications from Asian-Americans based on a subjective rating system that was vulnerable to stereotyping.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions made four interrelated claims: that Harvard intentionally discriminated against Asian-Americans; that it used race as a predominant factor in admissions decisions; that it racially balanced its classes; and that it had considered applicants\u2019 race without first exhausting race-neutral alternatives to create diversity. Judge Burroughs cleared the university of all four claims.\n\nStill, she said that Harvard\u2019s admissions process was \u201cnot perfect.\u201d\n\nThe judge suggested that Harvard could do more to guard against the unconscious biases of admissions officers, echoing an argument that the plaintiff made at trial. She noted more explicit guidelines on using race that were developed for the officers during the litigation, and said the officers could also be made aware of significant statistical disparities related to race.", "description": "The lawsuit presented one of the biggest challenges to affirmative action in years, and is almost certain to reach the Supreme Court.", "authors": ["Anemona Hartocollis"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/us/01HARVARD/merlin_141190017_e5f74c84-9090-450a-8fca-7885c7c1a2e9-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
