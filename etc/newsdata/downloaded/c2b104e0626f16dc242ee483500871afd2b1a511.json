The cuts, since abandoned, flowed from the austerity package required to secure a $US4.2 billion ($6.2 billion) loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nAt the same time the streets of Peru\u2019s capital, Lima, seethedwith violent intent after the president dissolved congress when attempts to \u201creform\u201d the judiciary were again delayed.\n\nA month before that the streets of Buenos Aires were clogged by protests against food shortages, wage austerity and the potential that the debt-crushed nation\u2019s next IMF bailout would require even harsher economic restraint.\n\nSo why should any of that hold anything but passing substance for the fund managers that direct large pools of BHP or Rio Tinto?\n\nWell, for a real world start, one of the Chilean cities left under martial curfew is Antafogasta. It is home to Escondida Minera, the company that operates an eponymous mine in the Andean desert. Escondida is the world\u2019s single biggest copper producer and it is owned in slightly uneven joint venture by BHP and Rio Tinto.\n\nEscondida is a $US12.7 billion asset that has been the target of $US10 billion or so of investment over the past decade and that generated $US2.1 billion in earnings last year.\n\nTo the north of Escondida, BHP owns another copper complex called Pampa Norte. It includes the Spence mine that is presently subject of a $US2.5 billion expansion, and Pampa Norte has a book value of $$US1.9 billion and last year generated a $US626 million profit.\n\nSince the violence began and a curfew was enforced, Escondida and Spence management have followed security protocols that encourage them to work from home. But work at the mine had continued unaffected. Until Tuesday, that is, when miners staged rolling \u201csolidarity\u201d stoppages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Escondida Union No. 1 union ordered \u201cwarning stoppages\u201d that trimmed five hours from a day and a night shift on Tuesday. It is expected there will be a national day of strike action on Wednesday, with Escondida\u2019s union leadership urging action to \u201cparalyse all mining\u201d in Chile until the police and military are removed from the streets.\n\nSo what really matters?\n\nIn the wake of the UBS shareholder poll, I asked a BHP insider to make a list of the top issues. I was offered a big three: fiscal stability in host provinces and nations, tailings dams and socialising the response to climate change.\n\nBut even if this isn\u2019t the Latin Spring that some excited academics have said it might be, events in Chile announce the need for a fourth plank to that slate of issues: inequality.\n\nIt is worth noting that pretty much none of that four appeared in the UBS list of the five most-prominent institutional shareholder concerns.\n\nFor the record, the top five for BHP were iron ore price, CEO succession (which appears to be live), turning around Olympic Dam, the Jansen project and the ESG (environment, social and governance) issues that arise from owning thermal coal production.\n\nThe big five for Rio\u2019s owners were iron ore, US-China trade tensions, the risk of acquisitive growth, sovereign risk in Mongolia and the aluminium price outlook.\n\nNow, of course, it would be deluded to imagine there is anything that BHP or Rio could or should have done to mitigate the outpouring of anger in Chile or Peru (where BHP owns a copper mine) or Ecuador (where BHP, Fortescue and Newcrest have copper and gold exploration teams).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is surely competitive advantage to be gained and shareholder value to be protected from the identification of systemic failure at a broader social level across host nations and taking a leadership position by responding to that at the individual commercial level.\n\nThat is why, for example, Rio has decided to risk criticism of overreach by taking an overtly active role in attempting to reshape the syllabus of TAFE colleges in Western Australia.\n\nRobot anxieties\n\nRio has, famously, been a first mover in mining and logistics automation in Australia. The house view, as expressed at an ESG investor briefing held by the Rio board earlier this year, is that the rise of the robots means that legacy jobs go, people are displaced, anxieties turn to anger and then potentially to collective resentment that undermines standing and risks a revival of the resources nationalism that so often results attempts to change tax or royalty settings.\n\nBut, given that automation is likely to create as many jobs as it removes, the way to defuse that risk is to work with the WA education department to develop a new set of recognised standards for training workers to operate and maintain automated equipment.\n\nAnd that is why, on Wednesday, BHP\u2019s external affairs executive, Geoff Healy, will reprise to an audience in Sydney an investor briefing delivered in London earlier this month that announced that the accumulation of \u201csocial value\u201d had become a fundamental and evolutionary challenge for the company.\n\nBHP has been criticised for virtue signalling and grandstanding for assuming a right to leadership in public debate on issues that many still believe stretches beyond the comfortable vacuum of its commercial interests.\n\nIn January, in lock-step with Rio, BHP announced its support of the Uluru Statement and its recommendation of an indigenous voice for the Parliament. More recently the company announced $US400 million of direct action in the name of mitigation of greenhouse emissions produced by customers that use the raw materials BHP sells.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBHP\u2019s view is that those initiatives are reinforcing of its brand, supportive of its host communities and enhancing of its commercial future.\n\nBeing good is good for business\n\n\u201cFor us, it is plain and simple good business,\u201d Healy said in London two weeks ago. \u201cWe are part of a society that expects more of us. We recognise our success depends on our ability to earn their trust and confidence and we know that this means improving the way that we do business, at all levels from local to global,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we make business decisions, both financial value and social value considerations come into play. Each depends on the other for the decision to be effective.\n\n\u201cWe know that the way we make business decisions has the potential to positively or negatively impact those around us, often materially. We recognise that balancing financial value and social value sometimes calls for trade-offs and that it is ultimately a matter of judgement as to how to draw the right balance.\n\n\u201cEnsuring that these key judgements are made by the right people, with the right information, at the right time, across the entirety of BHP is our objective. If we can get this right \u2013 and by right I mean embedded to our core \u2013 we believe we will win access to the best talent, the best resources, and the best markets, to set ourselves up to deliver a sustained competitive advantage.\u201d", "description": "This might not be the Latin Spring but it should be a wake-up call for the risk-profilers that guide the major shareholders of BHP and Rio Tinto,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1437%2C$y_694/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/773b980b4b4f754f48fe269fe7c2ef7f8f4355c4", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
