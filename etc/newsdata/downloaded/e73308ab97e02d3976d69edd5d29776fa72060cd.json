It was especially nice to see the so-called \"SA Inc\" stocks do well. Financials were up 1.3% and the banks were up 1.6%. But most impressive was Clicks (JO: ) which jumped 13.5% after a very impressive trading statement. The company is expecting headline earnings per share to grow by between 15% and 18%. That is well above forecasts of 10%-15%.\n\nClearly spending on beauty products is still strong. The market was certainly impressed. I would say that this can definitely be considered a green shoot. Not just the trading update but the really positive market reaction.\n\nMarkets in the US were subdued on Monday. We are in a holding pattern as we wait for trade war updates later this week. A high level Chinese delegation is currently headed to Washington. As we speak Asian markets are higher and US futures are also in the green. Markets are expecting some progress.\n\nYesterday the closed up 0.5%, the closed down 0.45%, and the closed down 0.33%.\n\nOur 10c Worth\n\nOne thing, from Paul\n\nTrade unions? When I was younger, you used to hear about them all the time. The left-leaning economists at universities would talk up their \"union connections\" like it was badge of honour to have strong links to the shop floor.\n\nIn 2019, unions only seem to be a factor in tired, labour-intensive industries that are unable to mechanise production. Those with complex, difficult production processes, like mining gold 4 kilometres under the ground. The services industries are far less susceptible to unionisation.\n\nOf course, unions are also powerful where employers are weak. So they are massive and intransigent in the state sector in South Africa. Teachers, police and hospital workers have considerable bargaining power because their employer is a pushover. Eskom and SAA can't seem to slim down, despite being vastly overstaffed by international norms.\n\nCapital is now more powerful than Labour. In the last three decades, returns on capital have risen whilst wage gains have stagnated. This is why you need to be a saver and an investor, not simply a worker or salaried supplier of office hours.\n\nHow does this current General Motors (NYSE: ) strike in the US by the United Auto Workers sound to you? Negotiations broke down over a new 4 year contract and UAW's GM members have been off work since September 16. The UAW wants \"higher wages, affordable health care, a greater share of profits, job security, and a path for permanent positions for temporary employees\". Sure, anything else?\n\nMeanwhile, GM (NYSE: ) has shifted production to Mexico and plans to shut 4 more US factories. GM produces 880,000 pickups and SUVs a year in Mexico, two-thirds of which are exported to the US. The company has estimated that it would cost at least $1 billion to convert under-utilised US car plants to truck or SUV production. The problem is that that capital outlay has to be taken from the same budget of billions needed for investments in future technologies, like electric and autonomous vehicles. GM is yesterday's hero. Personally, I'd rather own Tesla shares.\n\nUnited Auto Workers\n\nByron's Beats\n\nTechnology is helping us make many daily decisions. What to eat, what to read, what to buy. Now you can use your phone to help you match your outfits. Google (NASDAQ: ) Lens (NASDAQ: ) just launched a new feature called Style Ideas. If you see an item of clothing you like on social media, screen grab it on Google Lens and Google will show you the best items to match it with. Likewise if you see a groovy leopard print dress in a store, take a photo and ask Google what it would look best paired with.\n\nThis feature keeps the power in Google's hands in terms of online advertising. If this goes mainstream it will be imperative for clothing retailers to be featured in Google's suggestions. As a company, Google (NASDAQ: ) is really good at coming up with ideas to stay on top. You can read more about the feature here on the Google Blog.\n\nGoogle Lens\n\nBright's Banter\n\nChina's ByteDance, the owner of video-sharing app TikTok, netted revenues of between $7 billion and $8.4 billion in a much better-than-expected first half performance. TikTok is one of the world's most valuable unicorns and it also reported that it turned profitable for the first time in June. The privately-held company said that it is comfortable that it will continue making a profit in the second half of the year.\n\nThe kicker was the fact that ByteDance had to revise its revenue target upwards for the 2019 year from 100 billion yuan to 120 billion yuan. Most of ByteDance's revenue comes from China via the domestic version of TikTok, known as Douyin. Douyin apparently is an advertising fee machine, and the good news is that it's only in its early stages of growth.\n\nAccording to the entertainment company, ByteDance's apps enjoy 1.5 billion monthly active users and 700 million daily active users. The company launched a search engine that sits within Toutiao, which will help compete with Baidu (NASDAQ: ). The company also acquired a Wikipedia-esque site called Baike.com in the race to be the best content provider.\n\nByteDance's future plans include launching a paid music-streaming app to compete with the likes of KuGou (Tencent), QQ Music (Tencent), KuWo (Tencent), NetEase (NASDAQ: ) Cloud Music, and Xiami Music. Tencent Music Entertainment has more than 800 million active users and 150 million paying subscribers which helps them make quarterly revenues of $832.4 million.\n\nChina's ByteDance\n\nLinkfest, Lap it Up\n\nIf you bought Implats at the start of the year, your money would have almost tripled? here are the other big winners (and losers) of 2019 so far.\n\nThis was a good laugh. Fin 24 spoke about JSE traders getting distracted on Friday by the Springbok Rugby game. Vestact even gets a mention. Springbok game distracts traders on JSE.\n\nSigning off\n\nWe have opened higher today thanks to positive moves in Asian markets. Both Naspers(JO: )and Prosus (JO: ) are leading the charge. The is still hovering around R15.10 to the US Dollar. Clicks (JO: ) has managed to hold onto its gains at the open which is good news. Good luck to the Bokke today.\n\nSent to you by Team Vestact.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Vestact  covering: USD/ZAR, S&P 500, General Motors Company, Alphabet Inc Class A.
