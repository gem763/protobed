Marty Golden promised $12 million to revitalize two parks in Brooklyn. After he lost, the money never emerged, as first reported by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhy that is depends on who you ask.\n\nSenate Republican Leader John Flanagan has blamed the city for not filling out forms to receive the promised grants \u2014 an assertion he reiterated in a scathing Friday statement. A spokesperson for the Senate Democrats said Golden announced funds that never existed. The city has given credence to the Democrats\u2019 claim \u2014 a spokesperson for the city parks department said the agency can\u2019t verify that $4 million in funding ever existed and can\u2019t speak to the rest of the money, as the department was not the intended grantee.\n\nAs various factions point the finger, there\u2019s no indication the planned upgrades will ever get done \u2014 and local officials say that\u2019s the true shame.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of love out here when it comes to City Hall caring about our parks,\u201d said Council Member Justin Brannan, a Democrat who represents the district where one of the parks is located. \u201cWhen you have parks and playgrounds that have needed renovations for 20, 30 years, it\u2019s a really big deal.\u201d\n\nThe funding was meant to go toward rehabilitating a playground at Marine Park and a new ballfield at Shore Road Park.\n\nFlanagan insists city parks \u201cdropped the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese awards come from capital money controlled by the Majority,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cIt was incumbent upon the Parks Department to do one simple thing: fill out a form which was sent from Senator Golden\u2019s office to the agency and send it back to receive millions of dollars to fix these parks.\u201d\n\nHe added any assertion the money didn\u2019t exist is \u201cegregious,\u201d accusing the new Senate majority of \u201cperpetuating lies.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Senate Democrats pushed back, adding it\u2019s on Golden for not doing more to ensure the money would materialize during his final days in office.\n\n\"No amount of rambling nonsense can change the facts,\u201d said Gary Ginsburg, a spokesperson for the Senate Democrats. \u201cMarty Golden announced funds that didn\u2019t exist. You can't celebrate graduating from Harvard if all you've done is look at a preliminary application. After Marty lost, he spent his last months in office sulking instead of doing anything to secure those funds.\u201d\n\nCrystal Howard, a spokesperson for the parks department, said the agency has been \u201cunable to verify that the $4 million existed for the agency to receive.\u201d That money would have gone toward the Marine Park project.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge we did not receive a nomination letter from the senator for the funds that would have precipitated the process,\u201d Howard said.\n\nHoward said she can\u2019t speak to the other $8 million for Shore Road Park, as the department was not the intended recipient.\n\n\u201cIt is our understanding that the $8 million that was promised was to be allocated to the Shore Road Parks Conservancy to manage capital projects in the park, not to [the department],\u201d she said.\n\nThere is $10.3 million being invested in Marine Park for separate renovation projects, including a new playground expected to be completed in spring 2020 and a new pedestrian path.\n\nBut for now, whether the $12 million originally promised will ever resurface is uncertain.\n\n\u201cWe enjoy a collaborative relationship with local elected officials and look forward to working with them to improve Marine Park and other Brooklyn parks,\u201d Howard said.", "description": "As various factions point the finger, there\u2019s no indication the planned upgrades will ever get done.", "authors": ["Danielle Muoio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7c/22/b0bac77f4a81973b123178cfc415/171229-liberty-state-park-1-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
