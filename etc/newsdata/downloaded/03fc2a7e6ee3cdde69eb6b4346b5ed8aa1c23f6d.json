Tomorrow we have training with the players who didn\u2019t play, and on Sunday we have another match, and we are going to decide the same.\n\n\u201cOur target is to win on Sunday against Bournemouth, and we want to carry on our same way in each match.\u201d\n\nOn a positive night for the Gunners, Rob Holding, Kieran Tierney and Hector Bellerin \u2013 who captained the side \u2013 all came through 90 minutes as they continued their comebacks from injury.\n\nBellerin battled back from a nine-month lay-off with a serious knee injury to skipper the side on his first start since January and was proud to lead out the team.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a better way to come back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI feel very honoured to wear the Arsenal armband and lead the team out. It\u2019s been a tough road for me over the past eight months but I feel very luck to have had my players, family and friends around me.\n\n\u201cIt was a great win for the team, the spirit and the momentum we\u2019re building. This competition is really important.\n\n\u201cEven when we are three or four up, we want to keep giving everything. We can take a lot of positives to keep improving.\u201d\n\nStandard Liege head coach Michel Preud\u2019homme had pre-empted a strong showing from Arsenal\u2019s young talent and was left frustrated by his own side\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cWe showed them too much respect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey were quicker than us all over the pitch and we lacked aggression.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Unai Emery insists Mesut Ozil is currently undeserving of a place in his Arsenal squad as the Gunners saw off Standard Liege in their Europa League clash on Thursday night.
