Mother-of-two Tryce Harry, from Birmingham, died in March last year after going to Hungary for a 'freebie' Brazilian butt lift, her inquest was told.\n\nThe group, made up of 350 surgeons - most of whom are NHS consultants, debated the procedure at its annual scientific meeting and then voted on whether its members should be banned from giving patients the operations.\n\nThe BAAPS is now warning members not to perform buttock fat grafting surgery until a formal review of new evidence on the safety and techniques of the procedure is completed.\n\nIt wrote on Twitter: 'Following an international debate of world leading experts, The BAAPS has today announced its decision to launch a formal review of emerging new evidence into the safety and techniques used for fat-grafting buttock augmentation.'\n\nPaul Harris, president of BAAPS, said: 'As an organisation dedicated to advancing safety, innovation and excellence in aesthetic plastic surgery, we have a commitment to our patients to deliver the most up-to-date knowledge and research which safeguards our patient's safety.\n\n'Anyone thinking of having a fat-graft buttock augmentation should await the emergence of further evidence and BAAPS will be working hard to provide the public with information to help them with informed consent about this procedure.\n\nShe is believed to have suffered three heart attacks after the operation which involved injecting fat into muscles in her bottom.

It wrote: 'Following an international debate of world leading experts, The BAAPS has today announced its decision to launch a formal review of emerging new evidence into the safety and techniques used for fat-grafting buttock augmentation'\n\nThe procedure has been made popular by the appearance of celebrities like Kim Kardashian\n\nHOW COMMON IS THE BRAZILIAN BUTT LIFT? With a Brazilian butt lift, fat is taken from various parts of the body and put with the buttocks. It has grown increasingly popular in the United States, becoming the fastest-growing type of plastic surgery, according to 2015 statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The rate of buttock lift procedures rose 252 percent from 2000 to 2015. The total went from 1,356 to 4,767 procedures over the course of that time. More than 24,000 buttock augmentation with fat grafting procedures were performed in 2018, an increase of 19 per cent over the previous year, according to ASPS. Injecting fat into the butt can lead to problems if done improperly, including fat embolism - which is when fat enters the bloodstream and blocks a blood vessel.\n\nDuring a pre-inquest review hearing, her partner, Scott Franks, 31, revealed how the beautician had been interested in having the procedure for some time.\n\nShe travelled to the Izmir Private Can Hospital for the \u00a33,000 operation after she grew paranoid about her excess stomach weight from having children.\n\nMs Cambridge, followed the likes of reality TV stars Lauren Goodger and Amber Dowding in opting for the Turkish clinic.\n\nOther reality stars to have had surgery at the clinic include The Only Way is Essex star Georgia Kousoulou, who had a nose job there.\n\nJemma Lucy, who has appeared on Ex on the Beach and Celebrity Big Brother, revealed she had a Brazilian butt-lift there last year.\n\nMs Harry died after suffering a 'fat embolism' despite CPR and advanced life support treatment at a clinic in Budapest on March 19.\n\nKirk Harry, the 49-year-old's husband from Hockley, Birmingham, said she paid \u00a34,700 for a tummy tuck and breast lift and was offered the bottom lift as a 'freebie'.\n\nThe risk involved in the operation is that the fat which is injected into large veins can travel to the heart or brain, leading to severe illness or death.\n\nHowever, BAAPS president Simon Withey fears that banning the procedure in the UK could lead to more patients going abroad for the risky surgery.\n\nThe surgery, which usually takes around two hours, can lead to bacterial infection, scarring, dead tissue and abscesses.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, a briefing note about the poll said: 'We have invited some of the world's leading Brazilian butt lift experts\u2026 to take part in a series of lectures and debates on the topic.\n\n'We then plan to hold a round of indicative voting after the debates to understand the right direction for the BAAPS and its members to take.'\n\nOn Friday the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) will vote on whether or not its members, the majority of NHS-trained consultant plastic surgeons in private practice, should be banned from performing the procedure. However, BAAPS president Simon Withey fears that banning the procedure in the UK could lead to more patients going abroad for the risky surgery.

The amount of downtime ranges from one to three weeks, plastic surgeons claim.\n\nKim, married to Kanye West, has always denied having had a Brazilian Butt Lift or any form of bottom-boosting surgery.\n\nShe underwent an X-ray seven years ago during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians to prove she has never had implants.\n\nRumours about her having them went viral again in 2016, when eagle-eyed fans spotted an indent on her backside.\n\nKim claimed it was a rare side effect of having psoriasis injections in her bottom - but some doctors believe the dents are a sign of implants.", "description": "The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS)  debated the scandal-hit procedure in a meeting this afternoon.
