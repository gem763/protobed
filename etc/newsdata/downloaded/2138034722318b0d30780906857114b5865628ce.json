Some of his European colleagues aren\u2019t as convinced.\n\n\u201cEven if an agreement has been difficult, more and more difficult, it\u2019s still possible this week,\u201d Michel Barnier said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cReaching an agreement is still possible. Obviously, any agreement must work for all. The whole of the UK and the whole of the EU.\u201d\n\nIrish state broadcaster RTE has reported that the UK will bring fresh proposals to the table later on Tuesday in a bid to break the deadlock over the intractable Northern Irish backstop issue, which has held up negotiations for months.\n\n2/ Two well-placed sources have confirmed that UK negotiators will bring forward a new text when they meet European Commission negotiators in Brussels this morning \u2014 Tony Connelly (@tconnellyRTE) October 15, 2019\n\nThe news follows a meeting between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster on Monday night. It remains unclear whether the \u201cfresh\u201d proposals are just a rewording of the dual customs scheme suggested last week following a meeting between Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar.\n\nSuch a scheme would see Northern Ireland remain in the UK\u2019s customs territory while operating under EU rules and procedures on tariffs.\n\nPouring cold water on any rumors that the end may finally be nigh for Brexit talks, however, Germany\u2019s EU Minister Michael Roth reiterated his assessment that a no-deal Brexit would be a \u201cdisaster,\u201d while also playing down any optimism about reaching a deal with the UK negotiators in such a short timeframe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure if a deal is close,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso on rt.com BoJo accuses Labour of \u2018Soviet-era\u2019 expulsions, gets left red-faced by a former Tory colleague the PM himself had expelled\n\nFrance\u2019s Secretary of State for European Affairs Amelie de Montchalin said that while her government hoped for a possible Brexit deal, she is remaining realistic, emphasizing the need for a balanced deal and even hinting that she is open to another extension of the divorce deal deadline.\n\n\u201cTime alone is not a solution. However, if a significant political change takes place in the UK then that could potentially justify a discussion on an extension if we were asked for it,\u201d she told reporters in Luxembourg.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
