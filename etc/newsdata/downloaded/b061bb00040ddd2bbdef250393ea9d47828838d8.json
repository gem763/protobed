Hill, meanwhile, joined the White House as its top Russia analyst in April 2017 and stepped down in August.\n\nHill's testimony Monday was part of Congress' brewing impeachment inquiry examining whether President Donald Trump used his public office for private gain. At the center of the investigation is a July 25 phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and help discredit the FBI's Russia investigation.\n\nGiuliani's involvement in pressuring Ukraine goes back much further; Giuliani, in particular, has worked gather dirt on the Bidens since at least spring of last year, according to reports.\n\nA whistleblower complaint filed in August by an intelligence official has become the center of the impeachment inquiry, which is investigating Giuliani and the Trump administration's efforts in Ukraine and whether Trump tried to leverage US foreign policy in exchange for information that would personally benefit his reelection campaign.", "description": "\"I am not part of whatever drug deal Rudy and Mulvaney are cooking up,\" Bolton instructed his aide, Fiona Hill, to tell White House lawyers.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b9c22f05c5e5236008b62ba?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
