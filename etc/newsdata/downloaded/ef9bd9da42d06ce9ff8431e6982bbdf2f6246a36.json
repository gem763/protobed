Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers admitted this week that she made up her lurid tale of a backseat car rape, saying it \u201cwas a tactic\u201d to try to derail the judge\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee revealed the fraud in a letter to the FBI and Justice Department Friday, asking them to prosecute Judy Munro-Leighton for lying to and obstructing Congress.\n\nMr. Grassley said Ms. Munro-Leighton is a left-wing activist who hijacked another \u201cJane Doe\u201d anonymous report about a backseat rape and claimed it as her own story, calling it a \u201cvicious assault.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Jane Doe from Oceanside CA \u2014 Kavanaugh raped me,\u201d Ms. Munro-Leighton wrote in an Oct. 3 email claiming to have been a victim of the judge.\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s investigators tried to reach her for a month but were unsuccessful until this week, when they spoke to her by phone and she confessed that she was not the original Jane Doe, and \u201cdid that as a way to grab attention.\u201d\n\nShe admitted to the false allegation, and said she has actually never met Justice Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cI was angry, and I sent it out,\u201d she told investigators.\n\n\u201cIn short, during the committee\u2019s time-sensitive investigation of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Munro-Leighton submitted a fabricated allegation, which diverted committee resources,\u201d Mr. Grassley wrote. \u201cWhen questioned by Committee investigators she admitted it was false, a \u2018ploy,\u2019 and a \u2018tactic.\u2019 She was opposed to Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump seized on the report Saturday, calling her \u201ca vicious accuser.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the others? Where are the Dems on this?\u201d he demanded via Twitter.\n\nMr. Grassley has previously asked the FBI to probe Julie Swetnick and her lawyer, anti-Trump crusader Michael Avenatti, for lying to Congress and obstructing. Ms. Swetnick had originally claimed to have been the victim of gang rapes involving Justice Kavanaugh during high school parties, saying she saw him and a friend spike punch to leave girls unable to resist. She later changed her story to say she saw Justice Kavanaugh and his friend near a punch bowl, and could not identify them as having actually been part of any rape.\n\nNone of the witnesses she told NBC could corroborate her story were able to do so.\n\nIndeed, NBC found one woman who despite a sworn statement backing up Ms. Swetnick, told the network Mr. Avenatti was twisting her words.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process was delayed while the committee investigated a number of sexual assault and harassment claims, none of which have been corroborated by any public evidence to date.\n\nHe vehemently denied all of the claims.\n\nHe was confirmed, though only one Democrat joined with all but one Republican in backing him.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
