And when can you tune in?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know\u2026\n\nWhere is Killer Camp filmed?\n\nCamp Pleasant, the far-from-pleasant camp in the show, might look like some kind of idyllic American-style summer camp (albeit with a whole lot of slasher movie tropes thrown in) \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t filmed across the pond.\n\nAs it happens the series was shot in a forest in Lithuania \u2013 which in itself presented the makers with a few challenges.\n\nComedian Bobby Mair is in charge of proceeedings \u2013 not to mention those grim campfire tales (Picture: ITV)\n\nFor starters, the weather proved unpredictable \u2013 turning from sunshine to thunderstorms almost instantaneously \u2013 meaning sets often had to be moved from one location to another as much of the action was filmed outdoors.\n\n\u2018However, the makers were also faced with the task of having only a small opportunity to film at night \u2013 when the murder and campfire scenes were show \u2013 as being the summer, it wasn\u2019t getting dark until almost midnight.\n\nFilming the murders under the cover of darkness, and being near summer solstice in Lithuania, meant we would only have six hours of darkness to film before sunrise,\u2019 director Mike Parker told Broadcast Now.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018It was crucial to crack each murder at the storyboarding phase, and so we went into each sequence with a clear vision and each shot was factored into the tight schedule.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of which meant that filming days began in the afternoon, around 2pm \u2013 and often went on until 2am.\n\nWhen is Killer Camp on?\n\nThe series continues on ITV2 on Tuesday night at 9pm, and continues at the same time until the series finale on Thursday night at 9pm.\n\nIf you\u2019ve missed any episodes you can catch up via the ITV Hub.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
