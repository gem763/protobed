His audience sizes often number just in the double-digits, which could be viewed as a comedown compared to the thousands that were thronging Mr. O\u2019Rourke during his Senate race last year \u2014 including one September rally in Austin featuring Willie Nelson that drew upward of 50,000 people. Did he find this contrast deflating, a reporter asked Mr. O\u2019Rourke after a low-key rally at Keene State College in New Hampshire?\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m really grateful to anyone who would forgo a perfectly fine movie or dinner date to spend some time on a Friday night with a candidate for the presidency,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke replied, offering perhaps the only possible answer a politician could give (what candidate would admit to being \u201cdeflated?\u201d).\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke still manages to project earnestness with his entire body. He keeps casually dropping in his now-signature profanity because, he explained, being polite and restrained \u201cdoesn\u2019t always express the anger o r the urgency that I feel.\u201d\n\nHis zigzagging trajectory over the last year can be ordered into pronounced phases. Last fall \u2014 the peak of his Beto-Mania Phase \u2014 ended in a narrow loss to Mr. Cruz. Nevertheless, the hype persisted. \u201cWe did not see that coming,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said of the continued attention, which ushered in a new phase.\n\nLate on election night, a couple of supporters wandered into Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s El Paso home to commiserate. \u201cThey were just these drunk dudes in their teens who were bummed out and decided to come to Beto\u2019s house,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke recalled. \u201cThey just walked in and were like \u2018Hey dude, we\u2019re just so sorry you lost, can I get a selfie with you?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Sure, but you can\u2019t just walk into someone\u2019s house like this.\u2019 And they were like \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke nursed his defeat, set out on a road trip and went to the dentist, live-streaming as he went. He decided to run for president. From the outset, the enterprise seemed to lack definition. He was outshone and overtaken in a crowded field of movement progressives (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren), an established elder (Joe Biden) and new faces (Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris) who seemed brighter than last year\u2019s meteor. He came off shaky and overwhelmed in the first two debates. Beto-mania 2018 seemed far away.", "description": "To observe Mr. O\u2019Rourke recently is to witness an unfiltered attempt at a midcourse transformation. He says he doesn\u2019t care about political niceties.", "authors": ["Mark Leibovich"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/19/us/politics/19orourke-01/merlin_160854573_a9f0f580-79f7-4a0c-9d2e-cff63c763b2b-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
