Hedge funds didn't care.\n\nThat's the story of the third quarter, according to Grayscale Investments. The $2.2 billion asset manager runs 10 different crypto-linked products.\n\nAccording to the firm's recently released flow numbers, last quarter was the most money the firm has seen flowing into its products ever \u2014 with $254.9 million in total.\n\nAnd the overwhelming majority of those assets \u2014 84% \u2014 came from hedge funds. That's a marked increase from the first quarter of this year, when hedge funds represented just 56% of the flows.\n\n\"There is an across-the-board sentiment that digital currencies is an asset class that is not going away,\" said Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale.\n\nSee more: Jonathan Soros is pumping $300 million into a new hedge fund run by one of his father's former portfolio managers\n\nWhat's notable is that hedge funds were pumping in money while the most popular currency, bitcoin, was hit hard. Bitcoin fell by 25% in the three months ending Sept. 30 but has still outperformed nearly every asset class this year, with the price more than doubling since the beginning of 2019 despite the third-quarter woes.\n\nGrayscale products likewise slumped in the quarter, with each one losing at least 30% of its value, but Sonnenshein believes hedge funds have noticed the bigger picture. For instance, the firm's biggest offering \u2014 a bitcoin-linked trust \u2014 has notched returns of more than 5,500% since it was launched in 2013.\n\n\"They're looking for alternatives for new sources of alpha,\" he said, while attributing the volume of flows partially to the firm's marketing campaign it launched in May that implored investors to drop gold in favor of crypto in their portfolios.\n\nHedge funds, despite post their best start to the year since 2013 with an average return of 4.9%, have still struggled to outperform the general market, pushing investors to demand greater transparency and more lenient fee structures. Crypto, Sonnenshein said, has been seen as a way for them to boost returns.\n\n\"They're having a hard time finding an investment opportunity with a better risk-return profile right now than bitcoin.\"\n\nSee more: The clock is about to strike midnight on a hedge fund's $1 million bet on bitcoin soaring above $50,000", "description": "Grayscale, which has 10 digital currency-linked products, had launched a marketing campaign in May to urge investors to swap gold for crypto exposure.", "authors": ["Bradley Saacks"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da0dddfcc4a0a222a4670c2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
