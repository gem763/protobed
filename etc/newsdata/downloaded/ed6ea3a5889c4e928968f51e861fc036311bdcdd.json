Contestants in Boys\u2019 Grade A and B had to conquer three laps along a designated route around the golf course in Fanling, which is approximately 6 kilometres, while participants in other categories would run two laps of around 4 km.\n\nThe ranking of teams depended on individual athletes' finishing position, as the first six to cross the finish line would earn points for the team. Hence, schools could not simply rely on one or two star runners; they had to ensure each member of the team would bring their A game.\n\nRegular champion DBS came out on top in Boys' Grade A and B, but they lost to West Island School in Grade C and had to settle for second place. It meant the school could not achieve a \"Grand Slam\" victory by dominating all three grades, like they did last year. Still, the school's top runner Michael Tse Chun-yin, who seized first place in Boys' Grade A, believed his teammates had put in their greatest effort, especially athletes \"on loan\" from other sports teams.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have many runners this year, so we had to borrow athletes from other sports teams, such as swimming and basketball. I think they did a really good job, so I don't feel sad just because we didn't get a Grand Slam,\" 18-year-old Michael told the media.\n\nAlthough Diocesan Boys' School did not achieve a \"Grand Slam\" victory like last year, Michael Tse Chun-yin was still satisfied with the team's performance. Photo: SCMP / Kelly Ho Reflecting on his own performance, the Form Six student said he was pleased with his speedy recovery from last Sunday's marathon race, in which he broke the Hong Kong Men's Junior 10 km record. He also called winning an individual gold medal, as well as the team champion award, a \"regretless\" conclusion to his interschool cross country career.\n\n\"It's my last year representing DBS, and being able to attain such results leaves me with no regrets,\" he said.\n\nMichael noted that he was the luckier ones who got to take part in the competition as planned, since many interschool events had been cancelled by the Hong Kong Schools Sports Federation (HKSSF) recently due to safety concerns caused by the ongoing anti-government protests. He hopes the organisers will recognise the importance of school-level competitions to secondary student-athletes, and urged them to try their best to hold the competitions as scheduled and reschedule the cancelled races.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Girls' category, Heep Yunn strived to repeat their success from last year. They won the Grade A category, but only finished in third place in Grade B and second place in Grade C. Still, their overall ranking surpassed their main rivals West Island School and Diocesan Girls' School, thus keeping the overall champion's title they have held since 2016.\n\nKylie Poon Yiu-man, team captain of Heep Yunn, admitted it was a challenging task to fulfil the school's winning streak. Like DBS, Heep Yunn only has a few cross country runners. The Form Five captain herself is not a runner either; she is from the school's basketball team, which lent several players to the cross country team this year. Surprisingly, these \"borrowed\" athletes pulled off a remarkable performance, especially swimmer Ma Wing-yu, who was the first runner-up in Grade B.\n\nHeep Yunn School's team captain Kylie Poon Yiu-man debriefed her teammates after the race.

A lot of athletes did unexpectedly well, which was why we could win the overall title,\" Kylie said.\n\nSecondary cross country athletes will meet again in December at the All Hong Kong Schools Jing Ying Cross Country Tournament, where runners from schools across the city will take part.", "description": "The students managed to defend years-long winning streaks, despite having to borrow athletes from other sports teams.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/dbs1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
