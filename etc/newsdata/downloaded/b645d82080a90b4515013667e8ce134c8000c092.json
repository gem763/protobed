But Mr. Fogelman\u2019s new deal, valued at between $100 million and $150 million, according to a person familiar with the pact, is frontloaded. He won\u2019t get any profits from reruns down the road, for \u201cThis is Us\u201d or other shows, but in lieu of that he gets an unusually big check right away.\n\nBehind the new model: Netflix Inc., which popularized upfront payments for talent.\n\nThe entertainment industry is going through its most dramatic period of change in decades, as the Hollywood\u2019s traditional players, fortified by megamergers, launch new streaming services\u2014selling programming directly to consumers online for the first time. They\u2019re spending hundreds of millions of dollars to secure high-quality programming, and in the process are fundamentally reimagining how they do business with talent.\n\nMany of Netflix\u2019s tactics are becoming the industry norm. Industry titans like AT&T Inc. \u2019s WarnerMedia and Disney are locking up the biggest creators, from \u201cStar Wars\u201d veteran J.J. Abrams to \u201cRiverdale\u201d producer Greg Berlanti in lucrative multiyear deals. Studios are looking for more flexibility to put shows on whichever platforms they choose, including their nascent streaming outlets.\n\nWarner Bros. signed star producer and director J.J. Abrams (pictured on the set of \u201cStar Trek: Into Darkness with actor Chris Pine) to a deal valued at $275 million or more. The deal commits him to projects for HBO Max but also gives him freedom to make shows elsewhere.

For consumers, that means more shows they love will run their course within three or four years instead of seven or eight. For the talent, it means moving on to new jobs more frequently.\n\nLuring TV\u2019s biggest stars to jump into streaming, if they already haven\u2019t, is a high priority. Kaley Cuoco has had a charmed life in broadcast TV, most recently starring for 12 years on CBS\u2019s hit comedy \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d She plans to take up her next role in a drama for HBO Max, the upcoming WarnerMedia streaming service that will bring together HBO and the rest of the Warner empire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the guinea pigs,\u201d Ms. Cuoco said of her deal to star in and produce \u201cThe Flight Attendant,\u201d a thriller series based on the novel of the same name. \u201cIt is a little scary.\u201d\n\nThe new streaming launches are around the corner. Disney, which already controls Hulu, in November will debut a new low-cost service, Disney+, which will feature its major Marvel and Star Wars franchises and a bevy of kids content, some of which is coming from outside suppliers, including \u201cDiary of a Female President,\u201d from CBS Studios. Apple Inc. around the same time is launching with a handful of premium shows featuring big stars. WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max and Comcast\u2019s Peacock will debut next year, adding to the already fierce competition between Netflix, Amazon.com Inc., Hulu and CBS\u2019s \u201cAll Access.\u201d In just the past several weeks the companies have collectively committed several billion dollars to secure deals with top producers and rights to popular old shows.\n\nOn set at \u2018Diary of a Female President,\u2019 a series from CBS Studios that will run on Disney\u2019s streaming service, Disney+.l Photo: Alex Welsh for The Wall Street Journal\n\nUpfront Money\n\nFor decades, the formula for producers to make big money in TV was for a show to stay on the air long enough to have 100 episodes or more\u2014enough to sell reruns to other TV networks. The bulk of the profits for production studios and show creators have come from those \u201csyndication\u201d deals, not the initial fees to produce and air the show. The creators of \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d made hundreds of millions of dollars this way, as stakeholders who were entitled to a cut of the profits.\n\n\u201cTelevision used to be about bulk and volume and you fought to keep your show alive to get to that magic number,\u201d said producer Josh Schwartz, whose credits include the teen drama hits \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and \u201cThe O.C.\u201d\n\nNetflix signed prolific producer Shonda Rhimes, shown above in Cannes, France, this past June, to a lucrative multiyear deal. Photo: Christian Alminana/Getty Images\n\nNetflix did away with that model when it started wooing superstar producers to make content exclusively for the service, including \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d creator Shonda Rhimes and \u201cGlee\u201d producer Ryan Murphy. Netflix paid nine-figure upfront fees to Ms. Rhimes and Mr. Murphy. Netflix doesn\u2019t sell reruns of its shows to other platforms, so there weren\u2019t any syndication profits to be had for the producers, and the producers wanted a bigger check to work for Netflix.\n\nNow, Warner Bros., Disney and other studios are embracing the Netflix approach with some of their top producers. When Warner Bros. signed Mr. Berlanti for $300 million last year, the deal was structured similarly to those Netflix pacts. He gets a large amount of upfront money that essentially buys him out as a \u201cprofit participant\u201d\u2014or financial stakeholder\u2014in the shows he has made with the studio, a person familiar with the deal said. He will also receive bonuses based on how long a show runs.\n\nMessrs. Berlanti and Fogelman declined to comment on their deals.\n\nThese ideas aren\u2019t just being applied to the superstar producers. At Disney, the TV business unit has developed a new set of standard deal terms that gives producers big upfront fees but no back-end profits. The stakeholders can be rewarded during a show\u2019s run based on ratings, longevity and even awards, an executive familiar with the system said.\n\nNetflix signed producer Ryan Murphy, shown above at the Tony Awards in New York in June, to a multiyear exclusive deal.

New buyers are driving up costs and traditional studios \u201care paying more for writers and producers than ever before,\u201d he added.\n\nIn traditional TV deals, creators face the risk that their show might not live long enough to get into syndication\u2014or, even worse, they could create 80 or 100 episodes of a show, but never get a big financial payoff because there wasn\u2019t a market for its reruns. Mr. Schwartz, who is making shows for Disney\u2019s Hulu and WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max, said that was the predicament after he produced the NBC comedy \u201cChuck\u201d for five seasons.\n\nBy guaranteeing creators a good amount of money early on, those risks go away, he said. On the other hand, there are possible downsides. If a show becomes a monster hit and does generate a windfall in profits from reruns, \u201cyou\u2019re probably leaving a lot of money on the table,\u201d he said.\n\nIn essence, it\u2019s a hedge.\n\nAll in the Family\n\nAs part of its model, Disney can put a show that it has produced on whichever platform it chooses without renegotiating with the producers who created it, the executive familiar with its system said. Warner has a similar approach on some deals. This could be important if either entertainment giant want to steer TV projects produced by its in-house studios to their own homegrown streaming services.\n\nThis represents a change to the usual way of doing things in Hollywood. Studios like Disney\u2019s typically sell the shows they produce to whichever network or streaming service will pay the most, even if it is owned by a rival. If they didn\u2019t, the talent could sue the studio for not maximizing profits. Under the new deals, those suits wouldn\u2019t be as much of a threat. By getting that fat paycheck in the beginning, the creators would essentially be bought out of having a say.\n\nProducer Mike Schur, whose credits include \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d is very concerned about the model Disney is using.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deal you make when you create a show. You guys own most of it, but I own some of it. Together we\u2019re going to go out into the marketplace and sell it to the person who offers the most money,\u201d Mr. Schur said. \u201cThe most strident capitalists in the world are the ones opposing a free market,\u201d he added.\n\nA Disney spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Schur\u2019s remarks.\n\nMr. Schur\u2019s current pact is with NBCUniversal\u2019s studio and is a traditional contract, but he expects down the road all the big media companies will embrace the new model.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all going to be swimming against this tide,\u201d Mr. Schur said, adding that this will be the \u201cbig struggle\u201d for the creative community in the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nImagine Entertainment Co-founder Brian Grazer said the consolidation and desire of big media companies to keep content in their own ecosystems will make success for creators more difficult, especially if they are unestablished and lacking clout.\n\n\u201cSure you can get a show made but would be at the right place? Would the compensation make sense? Those things will be more challenging,\u201d Mr. Grazer said.\n\nSo far, the big Hollywood studios have been careful to allow flexibility for their talent to continue to pursue projects elsewhere. Mr. Fogelman\u2019s Disney deal, for example, gives him freedom to work outside the Disney bubble and does not include a mandate to create for Disney+, a person familiar with his contract said. The sheer volume of content needed by the new streaming services will make it difficult for anyone to rely solely on in-house producers.\n\nSarah Schechter, president of Mr. Berlanti\u2019s outfit, Berlanti Productions, said Warner isn\u2019t pressuring the firm to produce content for its streaming service. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a monopolistic mandate. It\u2019s more of an opportunity as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. signed J.J. Abrams, committing to projects for HBO Max was part of the deal, but he also has the freedom to make shows elsewhere.The deal is valued at $275 million but may exceed that, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nBoth Disney and WarnerMedia are spending heavily on their streaming services. The Marvel Entertainment content for Disney+ costs as much as $15 million per episode, people familiar with the matter said. A few years ago, an expensive TV show cost $5 million per episode. The Disney family shows earmarked for the streaming service are more expensive than what the company spends for programs on its Disney Channel and Freeform outlets, says one executive whose company has a show on Disney+.\n\nJennifer Aniston, left, and Reese Witherspoon will co-star in \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on Apple\u2019s upcoming streaming service, TV+.

There won\u2019t be financial incentives to get up to 100 episodes. The old ideal of at least five seasons, with 22 episodes per season, is becoming a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cNow it feels like three is the new five and 10 is the new 22,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz.\n\nSome producers say that from a creative standpoint, they prefer the flexibility of doing fewer episodes. \u201cI would rather work in the 10-episode medium for the rest of my career. It gives a novelistic approach to the telling of it,\u201d said Janine Sherman Barrois, a veteran producer and showrunner of the TNT drama \u201cClaws\u201d whose upcoming HBO Max show \u201cCrime Farm\u201d attracted Nicole Kidman as an executive producer.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What\u2019s most important to you in a streaming service: access to TV classics or ambitious new shows? Join the conversation below.\n\nMs. Cuoco has a production deal with Warner Bros., which made \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d for CBS and is also part of WarnerMedia. In a sign of how projects can move around within the big conglomerates, she thought of \u201cThe Flight Attendant\u201d for TNT, a WarnerMedia cable channel, and brought it to Sarah Aubrey, the executive in charge of programming there. When Ms. Aubrey was tapped to oversee content for HBO Max, the project went with her.\n\nShe knows the chances of repeating the success of \u201cBig Bang Theory,\u201d which was TV\u2019s No. 1 show for years, are slim, in part because the industry has changed so much and there is so much competition for viewers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that sort of situation, that kind of money, that kind of attention for 12 years is even possible,\u201d said Ms. Cuoco, who got her start 25 years ago in an episode of ABC\u2019s \u201cMy So-Called Life.\u201d\n\nShe said there is something \u201cvery enticing about being on the ground floor\u201d with the HBO Max service, though she still plans to be in the mix when broadcast TV shows are being cast in the spring. \u201cI need to be out for pilot season,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "description": "In the battle to dominate the new entertainment landscape, Hollywood\u2019s titans are borrowing from Netflix\u2019s playbook, transforming how they do business with writers, producers and stars\u2014and how money is made in entertainment.", "authors": ["Joe Flint", "Joe.Flint Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FA709_STREAM_SOC_20190920162557.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
