All the user sees is an efficient and effective service that they can access.\n\nAt present, the DTA is focusing on three life events with each project being led by the states and territories.\n\n\u201cWe have a \u2018having a baby\u2019 life event project that the ACT government is leading in collaboration with the federal government, Queensland and New South Wales, a \u2018finding a job\u2019 life event being led by Queensland, and another focused on end of life being led by New South Wales,\u201d Poole says.\n\nAs to what happens across these life events, Poole says it\u2019s about minimising the amount of process involved by linking data between departments. For example, parents and their newborn will interact with the medical system at a number of levels as well as the birth registry and more. It\u2019s about ensuring people have a more seamless experience in their whole of government dealings.\n\nAlexander says: \u201cIf we can capture just one or two additional pieces of information from registering your baby with Births, Deaths, and Marriages, we can use it to seamlessly update Medicare and get your child welfare entitlements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a marked improvement in service and what\u2019s more, it's not just about getting the government involved.\n\n\u201cIt expands out to the private sector, with partners like the Commonwealth Bank of Australia where with the birth of a child for example, child payments would go straight to a nominated bank account which is already known through other interactions and processes with government.\n\nHunter agrees this ecosystem approach allows for a much better citizen experience and the opportunities are huge.\n\nMoreover, process changes can be quite simple, by shifting interactions away from paper and cheques to electronic payments.\n\nShe says the New Payments Platform, which is an industry-wide payments platform rolled out across the nation, is going to provide a range of new opportunities for the digital exchange of data and value. For example, an individual could receive a text that their licence is due for renewal and within one or two touches, the payment is made and the licence renewed.\n\n\u201cObviously, equality of access will remain important and so individuals could still opt to receive notifications in the mail,\u201d Hunter points out.\n\nShe says the Commonwealth Bank of Australia\u2019s involvement in collaborating and co-designing some of these evolving government services starts at the ground level.\n\n\u201cFor example, we can push notifications through to customers using our app about what rebates are available to them. It makes a difference in the community and enhances financial wellbeing and at present it\u2019s working really well,\u201d Hunter says.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it's about giving consumers choice through personalisation options, and also not forgetting that digital is going to be one means.\n\n\u201cWe will always have other channels available to people so that the most vulnerable parts of society will continue to receive services and the support that they need, when they need it,\u201d Poole says.\n\nAnd Australia is not alone in going down this path with Singapore, New Zealand, the UK as well as the United States and much of Europe starting to embrace the idea of providing touch points at significant life events.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about reducing the number of touch points with governments to the lowest possible and at the same time be a lot more sophisticated about how we use data and offer intuitive experiences,\u201d Poole says.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate vision is to have seamlessly integrated services that support people's needs and life events. And of course, we achieve that through collaboration with our state and territory colleagues as well as other industry sectors and organisations like the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a much broader Connected Services ecosystem which can deliver solutions to many of a society\u2019s pain points beyond the individual such as transport solutions where small fintech players as well as big technology companies and major infrastructure players can work together.\n\nAnd it would seem banks are integral to connected services because together with government, \u201cthey pretty much provide the foundational underpinning of everything that happens in an economy,\u201d Hunter concludes.", "description": "The world sits at a turning point in its digital transformation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4644%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/92f23f71ce83baded82bfe7f4267df7bf04de962", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
