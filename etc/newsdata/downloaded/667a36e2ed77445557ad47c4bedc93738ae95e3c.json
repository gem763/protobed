So the tariffs are not an effective strategy for bringing down our deficit with the rest of the world.\"\n\nThe focus of nervous markets will now shift to Washington, DC, where the US Trade Representative is expected to move quickly to narrow down a preliminary list of goods in line for tariffs, a US source said.\n\nThe agency's provisional list of products that are eligible to be targeted with tariffs ranges from Airbus jets themselves to helicopters, wine, handbags and cheese.\n\nBefore any tariffs can be imposed, the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) must formally adopt the arbiters' report in a process expected to take between 10 days and four weeks.\n\nThe DSB's next scheduled meeting is on October 28, but Washington could request a special meeting 10 days after the arbiters' report is published, suggesting an earliest possible final nod on October 12.\n\nIn the largest case ever handled by the WTO, Washington had requested permission to impose tariffs on up to $11.2bn of EU goods.\n\nBrussels is pushing for tariffs of about $10bn on US goods in a parallel process to be decided by the WTO early next year.\n\nOn Tuesday, the head of Irish budget airlines group Ryanair urged the US and EU to pull back from the brink of a tariff war and said neither side's aviation industry would survive a long dispute.\n\nBut Peter Harrell, an adjunct senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, saw no immediate peace deal.\n\n\"My sense is that there will be a settlement only after both sides have imposed tariffs on each other,\" he said.\n\nFragile markets\n\nWhile the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days' worth of annual trade between Europe and the US, importers led by US airlines that buy Airbus jets have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the US economy.\n\nThe WTO award in the dispute could fuel rising trade tensions, diplomats say.\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing US tariffs on steel and aluminium and a threat from US President Donald Trump to penalise EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nThe Trump administration has concluded tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade, and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to US products.\n\nWashington is unlikely to skip the opportunity to implement tariffs in the case over aircraft subsidies, according to current and former US officials.\n\nAirbus has said this would lead to a \"lose-lose\" trade war, and the company has published a video stressing its contribution to the US industry through local assembly plants and 4,000 direct jobs, headlined \"Together, let's keep American aerospace great\".", "description": "Diplomats warn that the World Trade Organization award in the dispute could fuel rising trade tensions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/162d049176484f7a89dd3f3077bf0b7b_18.jpg"}
