Brunei, for example, suspended a law imposing the death penalty for gay sex only after global protests.\n\nThe persistence of anti-LGBTQ sentiments or the exploitation of such sentiments by leading politicians has not been limited to some of the world\u2019s least tolerant nations.\n\nAD\n\nEven though public approval of same-sex marriage has risen in a number of countries, including the United States, there are growing fears of a conservative backlash supported by opportunistic, populist right-wing politicians.\n\nBrazil\n\nOn paper, it appears as if homophobia is in retreat in Brazil: The country\u2019s Supreme Court recently criminalized homophobia, same-sex marriage has been legalized, and liberal institutions have made their support for LGBTQ individuals more visible.\n\nAD\n\nBut those advances have clashed with public skepticism and a growing political influence of evangelicals in the country \u2014 as well as the political rise of President Jair Bolsonaro, whose homophobic remarks are endangering LGBTQ individuals, according to rights advocates.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBefore, there was a sense that there were institutions that could help you. Judges, police, justice officials \u2014 you could rely on them. But now people feel comfortable saying things they wouldn\u2019t have before and more comfortable doing things they used to not,\u201d Miguel Doldan, a trans Brazilian man, told The Washington Post\u2019s Terrence McCoy in July.\n\nThe impact has so far been felt particularly heavily in schools, where Christian groups have pushed for bans on sexual identity education. But the governmental pressure has also resulted in steps to curtail LGBTQ rights in other realms. Rights advocates say hate crimes have sharply increased as a result.\n\nPoland and Hungary\n\nLGBTQ advocates across parts of post-communist Central Europe tell a similar story. In Poland, they have accused the country\u2019s right-wing populist Law and Justice party of exploiting a conservative backlash against their growing rights movement. Ahead of parliamentary elections this week, Law and Justice\u2019s prior focus on opposing migration has largely been replaced with what its lawmakers say is \u201cLGBT ideology.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome cities and provinces have declared themselves \u201cLGBT-ideology free,\u201d even though the declarations have no legal significance.\n\nThey still have sent a powerful and intimidating message to LGBTQ rights campaigners.\n\nThe party\u2019s leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, doubled down on those moves by condemning the integration of LGBTQ issues and sex education in school curriculums as \u201can attack on the family\u201d and \u201can attack on children.\u201d\n\n\u201cLGBT ideology,\u201d Kaczynski said earlier this year, is a \u201cthreat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state.\u201d He also called it an import from abroad.\n\nHis rhetoric echoed some of Bolsonaro\u2019s remarks.\n\nAD\n\nAs in Brazil, LGBTQ rights campaigners in Poland fear that the political division and heated rhetoric have led to a rise in hate crimes. This summer, tensions escalated during an LGBTQ parade in the eastern Polish city of Bialystok, as anti-LGBTQ protesters attacked participants in the march.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, in Hungary, a senior member of the Fidesz ruling party called for a boycott of Coca-Cola in August, after one of the company\u2019s ad campaigns featured same-sex couples.\n\nThe incident prompted concerns that Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s right-wing government may be testing whether anti-LGBTQ sentiments can be exploited to a similar extent in Hungary as they have been in Poland.\n\nAD\n\nAustria and France\n\nElsewhere in Europe, opposition parties have resorted to the same strategy.\n\nIn France, the far right recently joined forces with religious leaders to rally against an effort by President Emmanuel Macron to allow single women and lesbian couples access to in vitro fertilization. Critics of the law \u2014 among them the far-right National Rally opposition party \u2014 argue that legalizing such procedures deprives children of their right to have a father.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Austria\u2019s right-wing Freedom Party recently revived calls to ban same-sex marriage, which became legal in January. As a coalition partner in Chancellor Sebastian Kurz\u2019s right-wing government, the Freedom Party initially muted its criticism and refrained from challenging the legalization.\n\nAD\n\nBut after a government breakup this summer and plummeting approval ratings for the party, its new leader scrambled to mobilize core voters with the proposed same-sex marriage ban, which was introduced only days before new elections.\n\nThe Freedom Party still suffered significant losses, in what may serve as a warning to other right-wing parties seeking to exploit anti-LGBTQ sentiments electorally.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Fears of a conservative backlash supported by opportunistic, populist right-wing politicians are on the rise in a number of countries.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KvkZppRJIUn5zdKPbGDo1S1PKKQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EAHU6XJ3YI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
