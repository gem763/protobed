Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the most influential voices among young liberals and a rising Democratic star, plans to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president and appear with him at a rally on Saturday, according to two people with knowledge of her plans.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), another member of the \u201cSquad\u201d of four liberal congresswomen, also announced late Tuesday that she was backing Sanders.\n\nThe surprise endorsements are a political coup for Sanders, 78, who has been fading in the polls and faced growing questions about his age and health. Before Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate, he had been sidelined from the campaign trail for two weeks by a heart attack\u2026\n\nThe endorsements could be a blow for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer. Ocasio-Cortez had worked as a volunteer organizer for Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential bid; she was recruited to run for Congress in 2018 by Justice Democrats, a group that grew out of the Sanders campaign.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Democratic-Presidential-Hopeful-Bernie-Sanders-To-Be-Endorsed-By-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
