Sneakers, of course, can be a boon for both comfortable and nice-looking footwear, but things can get a little trickier from there, as there\u2019s a fine line between fugly and just plain ugly. So to find the best comfy and not-offensive-looking shoes out there, we asked 14 cool women who spend most of their days on their feet \u2014 including servers, chefs, nurses, flight attendants, hair stylists, and the like \u2014 about the shoes they wear. We admit that some of their picks aren\u2019t the most stylish or trendy, but remember that the now fugly cool Dansko clog was around for a lot longer than it\u2019s been the official shoe of hipster ceramists. So who really knows what\u2019s next? All we know is that if you\u2019re dreaming of a future with blister-free feet and a pain-free back, you will find footwear \u2014 including heels, flats, clogs, boots, sneakers, and more \u2014 to help you achieve that on the list below.\n\nBest comfortable heels\n\nDansko Women\u2019s Sam Ankle-Strap Clog \u201cI find the pickings to be kind of slim when looking for something supportive that still looks young and cool,\u201d says server Tess Parker. Dansko\u2019s Ankle-Strap Clogs, which Parker calls \u201ca solid-gold tip\u201d for anyone with knee or back problems, are the first pair of shoes she has found that fulfilled her requirements of being both supportive and young/cool-looking. The clogs have a \u201cslight but forgiving platform\u201d that helps make them so comfortable, according to Parker, who adds that \u201cour jobs tend to destroy shoes, but these are really long-lasting.\u201d From $108 at Amazon Buy From $108 at Amazon Buy\n\nClarks Women\u2019s Emslie Lulin Mary Jane $45 (was $85, now 47% off) According to flight attendant Crystal Roseberry, women in her field \u201ctypically wear two pairs of shoes at work.\u201d There are terminal shoes, which tend to be sexy heels worn from the time flight attendants arrive at the airport until they\u2019re in the air, and then in-flight shoes, which tend to be frumpy but comfy, she explains. But Roseberry says these Mary Janes from Clarks \u2014 which she has bought multiple pairs of \u2014 are \u201cthe best of both worlds; comfortable enough to wear all day long, and still fairly cute.\u201d They\u2019re her \u201chands-down favorite,\u201d she adds. From $45 at Amazon Buy From $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest comfortable flats\n\nEasy Spirit Getcity Ballet Flats $60 (was $79, now 24% off) Nurse Sorah Edeltuch told us she spends most of her days in sneakers. But she can\u2019t wear them all the time, and when she doesn\u2019t, Edeltuch puts on these Easy Spirit flats that she says are just as comfortable. \u201cEasy Spirit mostly make grandma shoes, but this pair is the one pair that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s for grandmas,\u201d she says. \u201cThey feel like you\u2019re walking on supportive pillows. I get so many compliments when I wear them to work.\u201d $60 at Easy Spirit Buy\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through so many flats,\u201d says flight attendant Heather Kovarik. And after testing out many styles that didn\u2019t do the job, she finally landed on two trusty pairs from Dr. Scholl\u2019s and Fila. Of both she says, \u201cTheir soles have traction, so you\u2019re less likely to slip, and they have a fair amount of cushion on the inside.\u201d Kovarik admits that nothing is entirely comfortable after an 18-hour day but says that \u201cthese two shoes help the most\u201d of any she\u2019s tried.\n\nClarks Women\u2019s Kinzie Light Skimmer Roseberry\u2019s favorite comfy flats are this pair from Clarks, which she says are \u201cwell made and cute, provide good support, and last forever.\u201d She wears them during long shifts in the air and says they keep her feet \u201cfeeling good all day.\u201d $55 at Amazon Buy $55 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest comfortable clogs\n\nDansko Professional Clogs Merica Lee, denim designer and ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at Frenchette, spends a lot of her time running back and forth between her factory in Brooklyn, the Garment District in Manhattan, and the restaurant in Tribeca. That\u2019s why she looks for shoes that allow her to \u201ceasily bop around between boroughs but are cute enough to wear to work.\u201d She calls Dankso clogs \u201ca standard for restaurant folks,\u201d as well as \u201cone of the most comfortable pair of shoes you can own.\u201d Lee opts for an all-white pair, which she says feels more stylish and unexpected than the classic black. \u201cFrom running around the city all morning to standing for eight hours straight behind the host stand, I have absolutely no problems wearing them all day.\u201d Flannery Klette-Kolton and Lauren Gerrie, who spend a lot of their time standing in commercial kitchens as the co-founders of catering company Big Little Get Together, also love Dansko clogs. And author Stephanie Danler told us she\u2019s been wearing her \u201cclunky but kitschy\u201d Dansko clogs since since she got her first restaurant job at 15 years old. $120 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBirkenstock Professional Unisex Profi Birki Slip Resistant Work Shoe Il Buco Alimentari\u2019s chef de cuisine Jamie Hogg\u2019s \u201cgo-to shoe\u201d is a simple pair of Birkenstock Birki shoes. \u201cThey\u2019re nonslip, low-key, last at least two years, and have a changeable inner sole,\u201d so when you wear them down, you can swap in a new comfy sole instead of rebuying a second pair. From $90 at Amazon Buy From $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nCrocs Unisex Bistro Pro Clog $30 (was $40, now 25% off) They aren\u2019t the most stylish pair on this list, but for an even more affordable \u2014 and just as comfortable \u2014 clog, Crocs will do the trick. By Chloe founder Chloe Coscarelli wears them while cooking in both commercial kitchens and at home in her apartment because \u201cthey\u2019re really comfortable and have the right amount of elevation to promote good posture.\u201d From $30 at Amazon Buy From $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest comfortable boots\n\nDr. Martens Chelsea Boot For winters in New York City, Gerrie swears by Dr. Martens Chelsea Boots as a comfortable but effective way to navigate icy streets. Lee \u2014 who wears a platform pair \u2014 agrees, adding, \u201cI can stomp around the factory floor in them by day, but the style means they\u2019re cute enough to wear to Frenchette at night.\u201d Since Dr. Martens were originally designed as workwear, they\u2019re \u201creally supportive and last forever,\u201d Lee explains. And the air-cushioned sole is so supportive, \u201cyou\u2019ll never want to take them off,\u201d she promises. $145 at Zappos Buy\n\nBlundstone Thermal Series For her comfortable footwear, chef Adina Halpern relies on Blundstone boots because they\u2019re \u201cvery resilient\u201d and \u201ccan transition from the kitchen to my regular life.\u201d They\u2019re waterproof, slip-resistant, and offer more ankle support than clogs or slides, which is a must in a busy commercial kitchen. Halpern even put their slip resistance to the test when she walked \u201caround a butcher shop where the floor was completely covered in beef fat, and never slipped.\u201d Plus, these have sheepskin lining that provides extra comfort and coziness during long stints of standing. From $210 at Amazon Buy From $210 at Amazon Buy\n\nFyre Veronica Combat Boots $198 (was $278, now 29% off) \u201cNot only are they super-durable, but the soft leather makes them very comfortable when I\u2019m on my feet for hours,\u201d Helene Henderson, the founder of the Malibu Farm restaurants (which just opened a location in the South Street Seaport), says of her favorite Frye Veronica Combat Boots. Beyond feeling good, these are also super-versatile and would be easy to pair with work or weekend outfits. $198 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nRed Wing Heritage Clara Boot \u201cSometimes, I work 14 hours on my feet, so I need to be comfortable, but I also want to look nice and cool all at the same time,\u201d says Chelsey Pickthorn, master stylist and founder of Pickthorn Salon. Her preferred way to keep her feet comfy but looking nice when the weather cools is by pulling on these Red Wing boots. \u201cThey are the most sturdy and soft and comfortable work boot.\u201d Pickthron loves them so much she told us she has her eye on a second pair in brown. $360 at Zappos Buy\n\nBest comfortable sneakers\n\nConverse Chuck Taylor All Star Both Gerrie and bartender-slash-seamstress Pam Wiznitzer say that Converse\u2019s Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers (which are also a favorite among Strategist staffers) are as comfortable as they are classic. \u201cWith additional cushioning inside, elastic by the tongue, laces (to keep the fit snug), and better gripping on the floor, these have become my new work shoe, and also ones that I can walk all around New York City streets in,\u201d explains Wiznitzer, who prefers low tops. Gerrie \u2014 who gravitates toward high tops in either canvas and leather \u2014 agrees, calling her Converse her \u201cmost tried and true shoe.\u201d From $45 at Amazon Buy From $45 at Amazon Buy\n\nNike Roshe One According to Yuki Izumi, Hi-Collar caf\u00e9\u2019s manager and signature barista, Nike makes the most comfortable sneakers to wear while slinging drinks behind the counter, owing to their supportive arches and snug fit. Although they are athletic sneakers, her favorite Roshe One\u2019s look a little less so than other gym sneakers. $75 at Zappos Buy\n\nNike Air Max 270 When she\u2019s not wearing clogs or boots, Lee relies on her \u201csleek and modern-looking\u201d Nike Air Max 270s, which she says feel like walking around on \u201csponges.\u201d She tells us that they look good with everything from jeans and jumpsuits to dresses and trousers, \u201cbut most important, they feel good.\u201d $150 at Nike Buy\n\nVia Spiga Raine Slip-on Sneaker $60 (was $150, now 60% off) If she\u2019s not in her Red Wings, Pickthorn relies on these slip-on Via Spigas to keep her feet comfortable on days when she\u2019s behind the chair. She calls them an \u201ceasy sneaker,\u201d adding \u201cthey are great for basically everything.\u201d $60 at Nordstrom Rack Buy\n\nBest comfortable sandals\n\nTeva Women's Original Universal Sandal While Gerrie got her start working in professional kitchens, she now spends a lot of time cooking on sailing boats and at yoga retreats in more tropical locations. If you\u2019re looking for comfy footwear for warmer weather, she swears by Teva\u2019s Universal Sandals, telling us they not only feel good but are super-cute and waterproof to boot. Strategist editor Anthony Rotunno also loves Tevas; he is such a fan he recently became the proud owner of a third pair. And the Universal Sandal also came recommended by trail guides when we asked them about the best hiking sandals (which by default need to be comfortable enough to get you through whatever trek you\u2019re on). From $49 at Amazon Buy From $49 at Amazon Buy\n\nEileen Fisher Sport Platform Sandal $146 (was $195, now 25% off) For a sportier-looking sandal, Pickthorn suggests this pair from Eileen Fisher, which she says are \u201cincredibly sturdy for walking and working\u201d owing to the thick straps and springy platform.
