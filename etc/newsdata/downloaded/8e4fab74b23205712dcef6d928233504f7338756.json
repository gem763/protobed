REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File Photo\n\nThe Armonk, New York-based technology services giant, which wrapped up the mega cloud merger with Linux maker Red Hat Inc earlier this year, has faced years of revenue declines in the process of shifting focus to the cloud from its traditional business.\n\nTotal revenue fell 3.9% to $18.03 billion, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $18.22 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue dropped 0.6%.\n\nRevenue from the company\u2019s cloud services, which are driving IBM\u2019s pivot away from established businesses including mainframe servers, rose 11% to $5 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.\n\nAfter a down-cycle, the company now expects a \u201cnormal\u201d product cycle in the mainframe servers business during the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.\n\nCLOUD FOCUS\n\nGinni Rometty, IBM chief executive officer for more than seven years, has been able to steer the company towards fast-growing cloud-computing business and lower its dependence on its traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors.\n\nWith the Red Hat deal, the company\u2019s biggest so far, IBM is looking to expand its subscription-based software offerings to counter falling software sales.\n\nIBM has said that it would be limited to reporting only a portion of Red Hat\u2019s actual revenue for some quarters, but will report all of its expenses, as required by U.S. accounting standards.\n\nThe company has also changed its reporting structure earlier this year. Its two biggest segments now are \u201ccloud and cognitive software\u201d and \u201cglobal technology services\u201d.\n\nThe cloud and cognitive software unit, which includes Red Hat, reported a 6.4% rise in revenue to $5.28 billion.\n\nIBM\u2019s global technology services segment, the company\u2019s biggest, reported $6.70 billion in revenue, down 5.6% from a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell to $1.67 billion, or $1.87 per share, from $2.69 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the company earned $2.68 per share, 1 cent above analysts\u2019 expectation.\n\nThe Dow component\u2019s shares, which have gained about 25% this year, were down 3.4% at $137.25 in extended trading.", "description": "International Business Machines Corp missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter revenue on Wednesday, overshadowing a profit beat and sending its shares down 3% in extended trading.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441601017&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1VF", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
