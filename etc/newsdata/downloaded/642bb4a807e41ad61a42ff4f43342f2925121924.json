He noted that the decision to put Mediaworks' TV assets up for sale was a commercial decision made by the company, and he did not want to intrude on the process.\n\nMedia commentator Bill Ralston said \"hundreds\" of journalism jobs would be lost if MediaWorks could not find a buyer for Three.\n\n\"TV3's been staggering along for a while, the big question is who will buy it and will anyone buy it? There's still the option that TV3 may just close down.\"\n\nTV3 presenter Jesse Mulligan said on Wednesday that Three may have no choice but to shut down if the government doesn't change its current broadcasting policy.\n\nThe Project host made his comments after MediaWorks confirmed it was cancelling Guy Williams' show New Zealand Today and cutting back popular comedy show 7 Days.\n\nA MediaWorks source said there were no rumours about any changes to The Project.\n\nA second source, a former MediaWorks employee, said digital audience numbers were healthy but they also come under the television umbrella.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMediaWorks TV, which is owned by United States private equity firm Oaktree, is the second major media business to be put up for sale this year.\n\n'Structural anomalies'\n\nAustralian e-commerce and media business Nine announced a plan to sell Stuff Ltd earlier this year, but put that on the backburner after it did not get an adequate bid.\n\nIt told a ministerial advisory group then that if \"structural anomalies\" in the media market were not addressed \"there is a genuine risk that the government, through its owned media channels, may become the only broadcaster in New Zealand\".\n\nThere has been speculation Oaktree has been open to offers for MediaWorks since then.\n\nHowever, there have been few guesses as to who might buy the business, beyond speculation that TVNZ might be interested in its television arm.\n\nMediaWorks chairman Jack Matthews said the company was committed to continuing to grow its business in New Zealand while recognising that free-to-air television operates in a challenging environment.\n\n\"The ongoing success of our radio business and recent merger with QMS demonstrates that MediaWorks has a very bright future. We are in the fortunate position of having two very strong growth platforms in radio and outdoor that deliver both revenue and margin growth,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our focus now is to accelerate the opportunities that exist for those platforms.\"\n\nMatthews said the market that free-to-air television operated in was tough and the conditions had been exacerbated this year.\n\n\"This is reflected in the performance of all free-to-air television operators in New Zealand, not just us. Clearly the market \u2013 alongside the structural hindrances we operate under \u2013 has a larger impact on three given its genuine commercial imperative,\" he said.\n\n\"The role Three plays in New Zealand society is significant, from Newshub through to investment in local comedy and drama. We believe MediaWorks TV is now in a place where it can be separated from the radio and outdoor business to be operated under a new owner in a more sustainable fashion \u2013 and, ultimately, for profit.\"\u200b\n\nStuff.co.nz", "description": "MediaWorks has put its television business up for sale, but there have been no immediate expressions of interest from TVNZ or Spark.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.53%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_84/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/33a3049fb3ead3a94d91bf6e045ce31f2f619569", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
