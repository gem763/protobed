Her staff has repeatedly denied she will do so, though she playfully told Trump on Tuesday not to \u201ctempt\u201d her. And yet, Trump isn\u2019t the only one conjuring up images of a Clinton comeback.\n\nThe idea that Clinton would mount a third presidential bid has circulated for months among fringe right-wing activists. Now, as House Democrats move closer to impeaching Trump, more mainstream pro-Trump figures are picking up the same claim.\n\n\u201cDo not be surprised, my friends, if she decides to try again in 2020,\u201d radio host Rush Limbaugh told his national audience on Sept. 27. \u201cDo not be surprised.\u201d\n\nThe phantom presidential campaign theory has also been picked up by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who said on Fox Business on Sept. 30 that \u201cshe is running.\u201d And it\u2019s been embraced over the past few days on Fox News, where hosts like Greg Gutfeld, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham have claimed Clinton could enter the race.\n\nIngraham told her audience on Monday that Clinton was rumored to be running.\n\n\u201cThere are serious whispers about another Hillary Clinton run,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. We should be so lucky.\u201d\n\nIngraham didn\u2019t expand on what \u201cwhispers\u201d she was referring to. On Monday\u2019s edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight, conservative columnist Mark Steyn claimed that Clinton was attacking Trump to set up her presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cShe wants them to hand her the crown again,\u201d Steyn said.\n\n\u201cI totally agree with you,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nMuch of the right\u2019s coverage of Clinton has focused on her recent book tour for The Book of Gutsy Women, which Clinton co-authored with her daughter Chelsea. While Clinton\u2019s talk show appearances and media interviews are clearly part of her book rollout, pro-Trump personalities have seen Clinton\u2019s increased visibility as the first step in a shadow presidential bid.\n\nFringier pro-Trump figures have long claimed that Clinton would launch yet another presidential bid. Pro-Trump blog The Gateway Pundit has frequently referenced \u201crumors\u201d of a Clinton bid. Ben Garrison, a pro-Trump cartoonist whose own White House invite was rescinded in July over an anti-Semitic cartoon he drew, reposted a convoluted February cartoon on Monday imagining Clinton as a groundhog seeing her shadow, marked \u201c2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill #HillaryClinton run again?\u201d Garrison tweeted. \u201cWe have always said yes.\u201d\n\nSome of the right\u2019s Clinton 2020 fever appears to come from a Monday tweet by @BreakingNLive, a right-leaning breaking news Twitter account with more than 125,000 followers. The account, which mixes straight-news rewrites of mainstream media headlines with thinly sourced \u201cbombshell\u201d exclusives that regularly fail to pan out, claimed that \u201cmultiple sources\u201d had told them Clinton was \u201cthinking about\u201d a run.\n\n@BreakingNLive never published an article expanding on the claim or their sourcing, and even conservative Twitter aggregator Twitchy described the post as \u201cone of those tweets we don\u2019t quite trust.\u201d Still, the tweet took off on the right-wing internet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying this for months\u2026\u201d tweeted conservative writer Eric Metaxas, the author of pro-Trump children\u2019s book Donald Drains the Swamp. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can bear to let so many Dems whom she thinks far less qualified than she get the office she did not get\u2026\u201d\n\nDespite the absolute lack of evidence Clinton is planning a 2020 bid,even former 2012 Republican presidential hopeful and ex-Godfather\u2019s Pizza chief Herman Cain weighed in on Monday, tweeting, \u201cOh boy, here we go again.\u201d", "description": "Even Donald Trump is getting into the act.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570573568/191008-sommer-hillary-clinton-tease_o7oexc", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
