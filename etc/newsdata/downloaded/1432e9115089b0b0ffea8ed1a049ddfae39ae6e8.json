The countries have released few details about how the agreements would be implemented.\n\n(For a link to the El Salvador deal, please click on: tmsnrt.rs/2ldjzJI.

A federal court initially blocked it from taking effect but the U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 11 allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.\n\nThe bulk of migrants - mostly families - arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are from the three northern triangle countries and many turn themselves in to border officials to ask for asylum in the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made reducing the ballooning number of asylum claims, which have led to long backlogs in U.S. immigration courts, a top priority of his administration and has implemented a series of measures to try to discourage migrants from applying.\n\nBut immigrant advocates say sending people seeking refuge back to the region where they fled, even if not to their home country, violates international commitments meant to prevent vulnerable migrants from being returned to danger. The three countries have tiny asylum offices that could have trouble adequately processing a large number of claims, they say.\n\nHonduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez has faced scrutiny over a court filing document related to the upcoming drug trafficking trial in New York of his brother, Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hernandez. The president has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday before the UN General Assembly, Hernandez again defended his political reputation against what he called \u201csmears\u201d from \u201ccriminals\u201d and others, without outright referring to the allegations against him.", "description": "Honduras signed a deal with the U.S. government on Wednesday that could push migrants who cross the country on the way to the United States back to seek asylum, in the latest bilateral deal with Central American countries aimed at curbing migration.", "authors": ["Mica Rosenberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433883732&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1ZJ", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
