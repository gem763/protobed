Now I\u2019m making about 200 or 300,\u201d he tells AFP.\n\n\u201cLook at this: there\u2019s hardly anyone here,\u201d says another vendor, 55-year-old Isabel Chavez.\n\nShe sells handmade sweets, but has left much of her stock at home, fearing it will go unsold and spoil. Her sales are down by 90 percent, she estimates.\n\nXochimilco, a maze of canals and artificial islands created centuries ago by the area\u2019s indigenous peoples, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that draws around one million tourists a year.\n\nAn idyllic splash of green improbably tucked into the sprawl of this capital of nine million people, it is a perfect place for a relaxing getaway with family and friends.\n\nFloating mariachi bands serenade visitors, and vendors in small boats drift past selling food, drinks, flowers and handcrafts.\n\nBut then, like a large rock thrown into a peaceful pond, \u201cthe incident\u201d happened: an intoxicated 20-year-old fell off a gondola and drowned.\n\nXochimilco is still struggling with the ripple effects.\n\nFending off safety fears, local authorities sharply restricted alcohol sales this month, began requiring life jackets and banned sound systems from party boats.\n\nBut so far, the new rules exist mainly on paper. And locals say the restrictions are not helping bring the tourists back anyway.\n\n\u2013 Horror, then helplessness \u2013\n\nOn September 1, a group of young friends from Puebla state, just east of Mexico City, rented several gondolas, or \u201ctrajineras,\u201d for a birthday party at Xochimilco.\n\nDrinking and dancing, they started climbing from boat to boat, when a 20-year-old identified as Jose Manuel fell in the water.\n\n\u201cNo! No!\u201d shouted his friends, as one kept recording video on a cell phone.\n\nAfter a moment of horrified shock, they tried to help him. But Jose Manuel never resurfaced. His body was found the next day.\n\nIt was not the first drowning in Xochimilco.\n\nAt least six people have drowned here in the past two years, according to El Heraldo de Mexico newspaper.\n\nBut it was the first such incident to be filmed. The clip went viral online and was picked up by Mexican media.\n\n\u201cIt was the video and the social networks that did us in,\u201d says Jose Zaldivar, director-general for tourism in Xochimilco\u2019s local government.\n\n\u2013 Rules and reality \u2013\n\nZaldivar\u2019s office presented gondoliers at the Nuevo Nativitas docks with 116 life jackets on Saturday, then pasted the new regulations inside their boats.\n\nIn addition to requiring life jackets, the measures limit alcohol consumption to one liter of hard liquor per boat or three beers per person. They also forbid climbing from boat to boat.\n\nBut rules are one thing. Reality is another.\n\nThere are not nearly enough life jackets to go around \u2014 just two or three per gondola, even though the boats have a capacity of 18. The release forms passengers are supposed to sign if they do not want to wear life jackets have not yet been printed.\n\nThen there is the question of how to regulate alcohol consumption.\n\nAuthorities have increased patrols in Xochimilco since the drowning, but even Zaldivar admits they are largely relying on visitors\u2019 goodwill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to have 1,100 people out here supervising every gondola in Xochimilco,\u201d he says.\n\nHe acknowledges there is a fragile balance between safety and fun.\n\nFor some visitors, life jackets and booze limits undermine the carefree liberty that Xochimilco is all about.\n\n\u201cKids my age, we want to be happy, we like to drink,\u201d says 19-year-old student Tania Silvan on her way to a trajinera.\n\nLocals are split over whether the solution is more regulation or less.\n\n\u201cThis is a first step, but they need to do more\u2026 like provide first-aid training,\u201d says Amaury Iniestra, 23, who sells handcrafts at the docks.\n\nThe authorities have proposed such training, but say they still have to work out the details.\n\nOther vendors \u2014 especially those who sell alcohol from floating bars or the artificial islands known as \u201cchinampas\u201d \u2014 complain the new regulations are hurting their livelihood, and say individuals should take responsibility for their own behavior.\n\nThere is consensus on one thing, though: tourism has yet to bounce back.", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Noe Carmona is poling his small boat around Mexico City\u2019s floating garden district, Xochimilco, trying to sell roasted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/a7529a_mariachis-onboard-trajineras-offer-music-visitors-in-mexico-city-xochimilco-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
