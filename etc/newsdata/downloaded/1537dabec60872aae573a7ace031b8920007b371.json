Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit challenging the subpoenas, and the case is now before the U.S. Appeals Court for the Second Circuit.\n\nDeutsche Bank said in a court filing in August that it has tax returns relating to the subpoenas, but the public version of the filing redacted the identities of the taxpayers.\n\nThe group of news organizations then filed a motion to unseal the names of the individuals. Deutsche Bank said it opposed the motion and revealed at that time that it had tax returns of two individuals, and none for businesses, named in the subpoenas. Trump's lawyers also opposed releasing the identities of the taxpayers.\n\nIn its ruling Thursday, the appeals court said the unredacted version of Deutsche Bank's August letter \"reports that the only tax returns it has for individuals or entities named in the subpoenas are not those of the President.\"\n\nSince Deutsche Bank doesn't have Trump's tax returns, the identity of the individuals whose tax returns the bank is not relevant for any issue the appeals court needs to decide in Trump's pending appeal of the case, the court said Thursday.\n\nThe revelation that Deutsche Bank doesn't have any of Trump's relevant tax returns is a setback for Democrats' efforts to obtain Trump's tax filings.\n\nDemocrats have filed a separate lawsuit in an effort to get the Treasury Department and IRS to comply with their requests and subpoenas for six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns.\n\nLegal experts had said that if Deutsche Bank possessed Trump's tax returns, Democrats would have likely have obtained them faster from the bank than they would through the IRS because the lawsuit over the Deutsche Bank subpoenas is further along.", "description": "Deutsche Bank doesn't have any tax returns belonging to President Trump that\u00a0pertain to a subpoena from House Democrats, federal appeals court judges in New York said Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419as6_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
