You have violated civil liberties and the separation of powers,\u201d the letter continued \u201cAll of this violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent.\u201d [emphasis in original]\n\nThe White House accused Democrats of using impeachment as a tool to not only \u201cundo the democratic results\u201d of the previous election, but to \u201cinfluence\u201d the upcoming contest as well, citing the words of Congressman Al Green (D-Texas), who in May expressed concerns that \u201cif we don't impeach the President, he will get reelected.\u201d\n\nThe letter also notes that ranking Republican committee members had not been granted the same subpoena powers as the Democratic chairmen leading the impeachment process \u2013 as they were during previous inquiries \u2013 slamming the process as unfair and \u201cone-sided.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Impeachment saga: Trump won\u2019t send EU envoy to stand before \u2018totally compromised KANGAROO COURT\u2019 but Dems file subpoena\n\nEarlier on Monday, the Democratic committee chairs issued a subpoena to compel the testimony of EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a key figure in the inquiry, after the White House signaled that it would block his appearance before Congress. The Trump administration appears to be doubling down on that move, arguing in the letter that it will simply not comply with future subpoenas.\n\nGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it.\n\nGoing along with the inquiry under its \u201ccurrent unconstitutional posture\u201d would \u201cinflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers,\u201d the letter said, adding that Democrats have \u201cleft the president no choice\u201d but to refuse to cooperate.\n\nAlso on rt.com Ukrainegate goes to Pentagon: House Democrats subpoena DoD & OMB as part of Trump impeachment probe\n\nThe missive is the White House\u2019s latest response to intensifying impeachment efforts spearheaded by House Democrats, who launched the proceedings late last month accusing Trump of pressuring the President of Ukraine to probe into the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in the country.\n\nSeveral Democratic opponents shot back at the document, some denouncing the move as an act of obstruction.\n\n\u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement on Tuesday, adding the president had \u201cnormalize[d] lawlessness.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
