Photo: The CW\n\nThe comedy podcast universe is ever expanding, not unlike the universe universe. We\u2019re here to make it a bit smaller, a bit more manageable. There are a lot of great shows, and each one has a lot of great episodes, so we want to highlight the exceptional, the noteworthy. Each week, our crack team of podcast enthusiasts and specialists and especially enthusiastic people will pick their favorites. We hope to have your ears permanently plugged with the best in aural comedy.\n\nPodcast: The Ride - Raging Waters With Rachel Bloom\n\n\u201cI love Googling pictures of Space Mountain with the lights on.\u201d In what is clearly the week\u2019s biggest news about the Emmy winner and new mom-to-be, Rachel Bloom (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) is a major amusement park nerd. Of course, the actor-writer-musical comedian (and did I mention Emmy winner?) is truly at home with Podcast: The Ride hosts Jason Sheridan, Scott Gairdner, and Mike Carlson. Finally, someone just as excited to peep the maintenance bay during a ride as they are. Before detailing her saga of filming at \u201cthe only theme park with rides guaranteed to wet your pants,\u201d this park-obsessed SoCal native has a lot of issues to air about, well, every other park. Bloom dishes on the worst-written rides, contrived ride setups, and unfinished narratives (looking at you, Tower of Terror). By the time the crew reaches Raging Waters, it\u2019ll make total sense why it was Rebecca Bunch\u2019s Paris. Bloom tells of exactly how she ended up riding in 50-degree stagnant water postseason \u2014 and why it still seems too good to be true. Thankfully, it sounds like she\u2019s not even remotely done using her love for amusement parks in her work. (Can you say \u201cniche concept album?\u201d) Listen with a change of clothes. \u2014Anna Marr\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nAsian, Not Asian - I Don\u2019t Think So, Oppa! (Feat. Bowen Yang, SNL)\n\nIn the biggest and only newsworthy SNL buzz of late, Bowen Yang made a historic leap to featured player. This week\u2019s Asian, Not Asian \u2014 recorded a week before that news broke \u2014 bookmarks one of the final days Yang was not a household name. Unlike other podcast hosts that shall not be named, ANA hosts and rising comics Fumi Abe and Mic Nguyen give Bowen Yang ample space to talk all things Asian-American. Yang opens up about why he didn\u2019t want to meet Joel Kim Booster at first, being compared to siblings, and of course, JRPGs. A discussion about when each comic started doing jokes about Asian culture evolves into an attempt to figure out what \u201cAsian voice\u201d is in comedy. Nguyen wisely concludes that \u201cwhen people say \u2018Don\u2019t do Asian jokes,\u2019 we\u2019re thinking of the Asian jokes white people say.\u201d Can\u2019t imagine which \u201cAsian jokes white people say\u201d they could be referring to. Japanese Salaryman Summer finally clocks out with a spirited round of \u201cI Don\u2019t Think So, Oppa!,\u201d the extremely specific podcast crossover segment of the century. Congrats to Bowen Yang, and congrats to Asian, Not Asian for continuing to push the discussion about Asian-American representation to unexplored heights. \u2014Mark Kramer\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nTake Me There - Touring the USA With Travis Helwig\n\nThe next best thing to taking a vacation is hearing about someone else\u2019s vacation \u2014 specifically how long they had to wait in the TSA line. If you agree with this sentiment then you\u2019ll enjoy new travel pod Take Me There from writer-husband and actress-wife Andrew and Alexandra Ford, who talk to their funny friends about trips they\u2019ve taken. \u201cTouring the USA With Travis Helwig\u201d (Adam Ruins Everything, Lovett or Leave It, Pod Save America) focuses on business travel in particular, a high-status burden most of us never get to experience. As the head writer for Crooked Media, Helwig tours the country for live shows pretty continuously, and he\u2019s got plenty of tips and tricks for how to make air travel more enjoyable, or at least less unenjoyable. This goes way past \u201cflying out of Burbank instead of LAX.\u201d We\u2019re talking showering at airports, living the #loungelife, Bird scooters, Goop guides, going CLEAR, and getting hit on at hotel bars by various southern business moguls. It\u2019s a fun window into the world of high-class business travel for a guy who has retinal-scan-level security access. Sure, a lot of the \u201ctips\u201d are only possible for those with lots of money and access, but somehow you don\u2019t resent hearing about them when they come from nice people. And don\u2019t worry, Take Me There has plenty of relatable content for the common man: The two biggest stars of this episode are room-service oatmeal and compression socks. \u2014Kate Doyle\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nScary Stories to Tell on the Pod - \u201cMe Tie Doughty Walker\u201d\n\nPiggybacking off of the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark movie, Scary Stories to Tell on the Pod offers a \u201chilarious deep dive into the terrifying world of American folklore, ghost stories, hauntings, and urban legends, through the lens of the classic children\u2019s series.\u201d It\u2019s a timely idea given the movie, but also the season. It\u2019s also impressive in terms of its ability to take some of the lesser stories and provide a reading and context that elevates them. Case in point, this week\u2019s episode focuses on \u201cMe Tie Doughty Walker,\u201d which is one of many in the series that hinges on the death of a dog, but instead of treading old and boring ground, SNL writer Anna Drezen and comedian Andrew Farmer dive in deeper to assess how scary the story is, which lends itself to the podcast particularly well because it requires a weird call-and-response song between the main characters that is inherently funny. Laughs aside, the hosts do check out the background of the story, which only leads to more laughs. Tune in if you\u2019re a spooky-story fan with a realist view on the genre\u2019s misgivings. \u2014Becca James\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nThe Ron Burgundy Podcast - Baseball With Clayton Kershaw\n\nHalfway through his second season of podcasting, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) has fully embraced the medium (after fumbling his way through the premiere season). He still has a tendency to treat it more or less like radio, but that\u2019s just so him. Producer/sidekick Carolina Barlow is back as well, with a more not-so-off-mic presence this time around. Things start off a bit grim as Burgundy reveals that, fresh from seeing his doctor, he has \u201ccontracted a cavity.\u201d It takes Carolina a while to talk him down from what he thinks is more or less a death sentence, and then it\u2019s right to the guest, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw. Then there\u2019s more confusion on Burgundy\u2019s part, as he is initially certain that he\u2019s the other Clayton Kershaw, \u201cCroatian circus clown.\u201d It\u2019s always interesting to see how real-world guests (as opposed to some of the characters that drop in to visit) treat the world of Ron Burgundy\u2019s reality. While some react as if the host is some kind of demented lunatic, others \u2014 like Kershaw \u2014 jump right in with both feet and go with whatever comes out of his mouth. Burgundy gets into how superstitious Major League Baseball pitchers tend to be, and Kershaw provides a couple of his weirdisms, which include wearing the same underwear for the rest of the season after pitching a winning game. (\u201cI wash them, of course,\u201d he says.) After their guest leaves the studio, Burgundy hints that he can try to hook Barlow up with the big-league hurler \u2026 an intimation that comes shortly after a lengthy segment talking to Kershaw about his wife and kids. Classic Burgundy! \u2014Marc Hershon\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nOther Podcasts We\u2019re Listening To:\n\nThe Underculture With James Adomian - Chris Matthews & Andrew Yang (w/ Joel Kim Booster)\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nMy Dead Parents - Steve Agee\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nThe Last Laugh - Bill Burr\n\nListen: Spotify | Apple | Website\n\nGot a comedy podcast recommendation?
