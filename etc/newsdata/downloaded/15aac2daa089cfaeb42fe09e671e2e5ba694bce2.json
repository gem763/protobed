But without the spectrum TPG\u2019s mobile ambitions are as dead as a dodo.\n\nNo rush\n\nChanticleer believes Teoh will not be rushing out to build a fourth mobile network if the merger is banned, mainly because of the evidence of former head of mobile networks at Telstra, Mike Wright.\n\nWright was presented by the ACCC as their star witness. When Michael Hodge, QC, who represented the ACCC, introduced Wright he described him in glowing terms.\n\nHodge said Wright \u201cis, with all due respect your honour, vastly more experienced, we would say in understanding the details of rolling out and operating a mobile network in Australia\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd he has the added advantage, distinct from some of the other witnesses that will appear in front of your honour, which is that he is disinterested and objective. He has no dog in this fight.\u201d\n\nIt is one of the peculiar aspects of this case that both the ACCC and Vodafone and TPG rely on Wright\u2019s evidence to prosecute their arguments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ACCC says Wright\u2019s expert evidence shows it is possible for TPG to build a fourth network. But TPG say Wright\u2019s evidence shows such a network would not be commercially viable because it would be patchy, suffer congestion and need to be doubled in size compared to TPG\u2019s original plan.\n\nVodafone relied on Wright\u2019s evidence about its looming lack of competitiveness should the merger not go ahead. Essentially, Wright said without the merger Vodafone\u2019s network would suffer congestion and have to raise prices to keep it functioning properly.\n\nThere was evidence Vodafone's excessive debt would prevent it from making the necessary capital investment in its network required to meet the explosion in data consumption on mobiles.\n\nMiddleton's poker face\n\nThroughout the trial, Middleton was careful to play a straight bat in his interactions with barristers from the ACCC, Vodafone (Ruth Higgins, SC) and TPG (Peter Brereton, SC). He gave nothing away about which side he would ultimately support.\n\nAlso, he displayed a strong sense of scepticism about what people say in court when pursuing a mega-deal.\n\nHe said there was a \u201cline of authority\u201d in \u201ccorporate litigation where directors or businessmen get up and make self-serving statements, and there's a lot of authority that says the court should be very careful about accepting at face value \u2013 not because you disbelieve them or they're lying or whatever, but it's just an inclination of human nature\u201d.\n\nAt another point Middleton said: \u201cI sort of remind you of core promises and non-core promises and people changing their mind. And there\u2019s ingenuity in explaining to the market why you have changed your mind. And maybe I am being too cynical, but anyhow.\u201d\n\nChanticleer gets the sense the ACCC is now more confident than it was before the trial began that there is a \u201creal chance\u201d Teoh will build a fourth network if the ban on the merger is maintained. Vodafone and TPG seem equally confident of their positions.\n\nMeanwhile, the two-year hiatus in the mobile market that has been gifted to the two dominant players, Telstra and Optus, will continue for another five months while Middleton writes his judgement.", "description": "A three-week court case challenging the ACCC ban on the $15 billion merger between Vodafone and TPG has left both sides confident of victory.
