Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamGraham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump Graham: White House needs to do better job on impeachment messaging Graham implores Trump on Syria: 'Listen to your commanders' MORE (R-S.C.) told reporters that the GOP senators were briefed in the White House situation room by Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"There's a plan coming together from the Joint Chiefs that I think may work, that may give us what we need to prevent ISIS from coming back. ... I am somewhat encouraged that a plan is coming about that will meet our core objectives in Syria,\" Graham told reporters.\n\nTroops in discussion: Graham indicated that troops were a part of the discussion within the administration, and signaled that the number of troops could be in the hundreds.\n\n\"All of that's being talked about. Is that enough? Well it's not thousands \u2014 is it enough to get the job done?\" Graham said, when asked how many U.S. troops would be included in the Pentagon's plan.\n\nHe added that he didn't know if the plan would ultimately be approved by Trump.\n\nGraham did not provide any other details about troops being sent to the Middle East. Pentagon officials told Fox News that the United States is \"likely\" to send tanks and soldiers into eastern Syria.\n\nWho was there: Sens.

The House is expected to vote on a sanctions package as soon as next week.\n\nAnd Pence meets with Trump allies: The same day, Vice President Pence huddled in the Capitol with Trump\u2019s top allies in the House to discuss \u201cprogress\u201d in Syria and other national security issues, meeting participants told The Hill.\n\nThose who met with Pence in the Senate dining room included House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyGOP protest overshadows impeachment hearing The Memo: GOP schisms deepen as Trump impeachment pressure rises Cheney says Congress needs to place sanctions on Turkey despite Trump announcement MORE (R-Calif.), GOP Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney Elizabeth (Liz) Lynn CheneyCheney says Congress needs to place sanctions on Turkey despite Trump announcement House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff House Republicans 'demand the release of the rules' on impeachment MORE (Wyo.), former Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsThe Memo: GOP schisms deepen as Trump impeachment pressure rises Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Partnership for America's Health Care Future \u2014 Trump official declines to detail plans if ObamaCare struck down | DEA unveils rule for opioid manufacturers | Republican tells Zuckerberg to allow anti-vax content Overnight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room MORE (R-N.C.), and the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Michael McCaul Michael Thomas McCaulCheney says Congress needs to place sanctions on Turkey despite Trump announcement Paul blocks vote on House-passed Syria resolution for second time Turkey sanctions face possible wall in GOP Senate MORE of Texas.\n\nThat conversation: Cheney, one of the loudest GOP critics of Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds, who have fought for years alongside the U.S. in the war against ISIS, declined to discuss specifics about the meeting but said GOP leaders and Pence talked about \u201cwhere we are headed from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really grateful the vice president came and took the time,\u201d Cheney said as she emerged from the meeting, \u201cand personally I\u2019m going to ensure that we continue to do everything we can do to fight ISIS to make sure that we can defend the nation, and I think it\u2019s very important for us to continue to stand with our allies around the world.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear if impeachment came up during the discussion.\n\nCheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said the meeting with Pence had been scheduled for several days.\n\n\u201cThe vice president wanted to come up and talk about where things stand with respect to Turkey and a number of other issues as well,\u201d Cheney said.\n\n\u201cThe focus was very much on national security.\u201d\n\nRead more from The Hill\u2019s Syria/Turkey coverage:\n\n-- The Hill: Syria says Turkish forces, allies attacked government troops, Kurds\n\n-- The Hill: Three-quarters say they're concerned by situation in Syria: poll\n\n-- The Hill: Pentagon chief rips Turkey over 'unwarranted' Syria invasion\n\n-- The Hill: Pompeo to reporter in Kansas: 'The whole predicate of your question is insane'\n\nNUCLEAR COMMAND NOMINEE SIDESTEPS QUESTIONS ON ARMS CONTROL TREATIES: The admiral nominated to lead the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons sidestepped questions Thursday on whether the United States should stay in a pair of treaties arms control advocates fear are on President Trump\u2019s chopping block.\n\nVice Adm. Charles Richard, the nominee to be commander of U.S. Strategic Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee he would give the president his \u201cbest military advice\u201d on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) and Treaty on Open Skies, and listed several pros and cons with each.\n\nBut he would not definitively say at his confirmation hearing whether he supports staying in the treaties or withdrawing despite several senators\u2019 attempts to get him to do so.\n\n\u201cI will support any arms control or other treaty that enhances the security of this nation,\u201d Richard said generally when asked about both treaties.\n\nAbout the treaties: New START, negotiated by the Obama administration, caps the number of deployed nuclear warheads the United States and Russia can have at 1,550 each.\n\nNew START is up for renewal in 2021. The Trump administration has indicated it wants to expand the scope of the treaty as a condition of extension, by taking steps such as folding in China and other weapons not currently covered by the agreement.\n\nSupporters of New START say the Trump administration\u2019s conditions are poison pills meant to kill the treaty.\n\nThe Open Skies Treaty, meanwhile, allows the pact\u2019s 34 signatories to fly unarmed observation flights over the entire territory of other signatories. The intention is to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.\n\nThe United States has also used the treaty in recent years to show support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, flying observation flights in 2018 after Russia seized Ukrainian naval ships and in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea.\n\nBut Republicans for years have accused Russia of violating the treaty by blocking flights over some of its territory, including Kaliningrad and areas near its border with the Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nNo commitment: Democrats first raised the alarm earlier this month that the administration was considering withdrawing from Open Skies, writing a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperOvernight Defense: Trump lifts sanctions on Turkey | 'Small number' of troops to remain by Syrian oil fields | Defense official's impeachment testimony delayed five hours after Republicans storm secure room Iraqi defense minister: US troops leaving in four weeks Trump announces he's lifting sanctions on Turkey MORE and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoTrump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Tehran's tyrants have been provoked Senators ask State Department to expedite visa for Kurdish commander should he visit US MORE that said they \u201cunderstand\u201d a withdrawal is under consideration.\n\nOn Thursday, Sen. Tom Cotton Thomas (Tom) Bryant CottonMelania Trump makes first solo visit to Capitol Hill Hillicon Valley: GOP lawmakers offer election security measure | FTC Dem worries government is 'captured' by Big Tech | Lawmakers condemn Apple over Hong Kong censorship Lawmakers condemn Apple, Activision Blizzard over censorship of Hong Kong protesters MORE (R-Ark.), an ardent opponent of Open Skies, pushed Richard on his case for withdrawing from the treaty.\n\nCotton asked Richard whether he sees \u201cvalue in remaining in a treaty where only one side is following the rules\u201d and whether \u201cwe have the best satellite constellation in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is a lot like the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty,\u201d Cotton said, referring to a treaty Trump has already withdrawn from. \u201cEveryone agrees Russia is not complying with it. Everyone agrees it would be best if we brought Russia back into compliance. Everyone agrees it would be great if everyone had a pony, as well. But we\u2019ve spent years trying to get Russia into compliance with this treaty, and in the meantime, Russia has continued to gain significant intelligence advantage over the United States.\u201d\n\nRichard told Cotton his analysis of Russia\u2019s violations was \u201cquite correct,\u201d but would not commit one way or the other on the treaty.\n\nPELOSI, DEMS SEND MESSAGE ON FOREIGN POLICY WITH HIGH-PROFILE TRIP: House Democrats are sending an implicit message that President Trump and his administration aren\u2019t the only ones setting U.S. foreign policy.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiSpeier to run for Oversight gavel Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump House passes third bill aimed at preventing foreign election interference MORE (D-Calif.) and her party are seeking to reassure foreign allies about U.S. policies, including the U.S. role in Syria and the broader Middle East, even as they move toward impeaching the president.\n\nThe most high-profile example came when Pelosi arrived in Jordan and Afghanistan over the weekend unannounced with seven other Democrats and one Republican.\n\nTiming: The trip was planned months before Trump\u2019s announcement of a withdrawal of troops from northern Syria, and it is common practice for lawmakers and U.S. officials not to announce trips to the Middle East beforehand for security reasons.\n\nBut the timing was notable coming amid heightened tensions between Trump and Democrats, who have launched a process that could lead to the president\u2019s removal from office. It is also just more than a year before the presidential election, with the Democratic campaign to elect a nominee already at a fever pitch.\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch Stephen Francis LynchPelosi, Democrats send message on foreign policy with high-profile trip GOP protest overshadows impeachment hearing House Dems demand documents from State Department in impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Mass.), who was on the trip, emphasized that the timing was just a coincidence. Still, the Syria withdrawal drastically altered the context of the conversations between the lawmakers and the leaders of both Jordan and Afghanistan, who expressed open concerns, Lynch said, about the commitment of the United States to its allies overseas.\n\n\u201cThat was palpable,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThere is concern, I think, on everyone\u2019s part.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message to the Jordanians was: \u2018The U.S. and Jordan have had a long relationship of mutual support, and we continue that,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cIn Afghanistan, it was a similar expression of congressional support.\u201d\n\nDays before leaving on the trip, the House last week overwhelmingly passed a resolution opposing Trump\u2019s decision on Syria. Just 60 Republicans opposed the measure.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s Rebecca Kheel has more here.\n\nON TAP FOR TOMORROW\n\nArmy Secretary Ryan McCarthyRyan McCarthyOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 House passes resolution rebuking Trump over Syria | Sparks fly at White House meeting on Syria | Dems say Trump called Pelosi a 'third-rate politician' | Trump, Graham trade jabs Senate confirms Trump's Air Force secretary pick Overnight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump to slap sanctions on Turkey for Syria offensive | Trump calls on Turkey to broker ceasefire | Pelosi, Graham seek deal on sanctions | Ex-Trump aide testifies in impeachment probe MORE, Undersecretary of the Navy Thomas Modly, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm.
