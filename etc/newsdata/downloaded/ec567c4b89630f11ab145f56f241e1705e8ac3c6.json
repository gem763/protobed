We know this. But do we really know why it\u2019s so bad?\n\nOK, we know some things.\n\nWe know pollution is bad for the planet; that it\u2019s contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s surface and the melting of the ice caps. We also know it\u2019s bad for our lungs and can cause respiratory illnesses. We know it\u2019s even bad for our skin, clogging our pores and causing dullness and breakouts.\n\nBut what else are air pollutants doing to our bodies?\n\nWell, pollution could be wreaking utter havoc on our hormones and reproductive systems. Not good news, particularly if you happen to live in a city that has been fondly nicknamed The Big Smoke.\n\nA new report has found that air pollution can raise the risk of a miscarriage by more than 50 per cent. The study of more than a quarter of a million pregnant women, found that living on a busy road was more dangerous to the health of their baby than smoking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s worrying, and it doesn\u2019t only impact expectant mothers. We all have hormones, and for all of us, they play a vital role in keeping us healthy.\n\nThe widespread lack of awareness about the effects of pollution on hormones and reproduction is definitely concerning.\n\nHow does pollution impact our hormones?\n\n\u2018In our bodies, we have hormone receptors on almost every kind of tissue you can imagine,\u2019 explains Dr Shruthi Mahalingaiah, specialist in obstetrics and gynecology.\n\n\u2018There are oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors on many cells in the body, particularly on hormone responsive tissues such as breast tissue, bone tissues or reproductive tissues.\n\n\u2018Historically, it has been shown that some types of pollutants can actually bind to hormone receptors. If there are other chemicals in our environment that can cross react or bind to hormone receptors, this can cause problems as your body ends up receiving the wrong signals.\u2019\n\n\u2018Increased exposure to the particles in the air we breathe does influence risk for menstrual irregularity\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nShruthi says that the most important thing to consider is that everything is interconnected when it comes to hormone systems and signalling. Our reproductive function is intricately linked to what we are exposed to, including pollutants.\n\n\u2018What has been most surprising to me is realising how penetrable our reproductive systems actually are,\u2019 says Shruthi.\n\n\u2018I really thought that the uterus and fallopian tubes were this kind of pristine, maternal environment. And the research over time has shown that it\u2019s really not protected. It\u2019s not a black box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Things that we inhale, for example, aerosolized heavy metals, metabolites of tobacco smoking like cotinine or nicotine\u2026 Some of these persistent organic pollutants are found in the fluid surrounding a developing egg.\u2019\n\nIn fact, a study earlier this month found carbon particles from pollution inside the placentas of pregnant women.\n\nAdditionally, Shruthi and her team looked at air pollution exposure in the high school age range and risk of menstrual irregularity later on in life.\n\n\u2018We found that increased exposure to the whole amount of particles in the air we breathe does seem to influence risk for menstrual irregularity later on in life,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018With that same cohort of women, we did find an increased risk of infertility, if you live closer to a major roadway. There was a 10 per cent compared to those living farther away (greater than 200 meters).\u2019\n\nThe effects of pollution on our hormones The studies show that increased exposure to pollution can cause: An increased risk of infertility\n\nA higher likelihood of irregular periods\n\nOne study found that it can raise the risk of a miscarriage by more than 50 per cent\n\nby more than 50 per cent Confused hormonal signals being sent around the body\n\nShruthi does say that there are many important considerations when doing this type of research, and that further research is needed to know whether the findings can be replicated.\n\n\u2018The menstrual cycle hasn\u2019t been previously evaluated in a lot of large-scale research. I\u2019m really excited to inspire people to use it as a marker of health and to incorporate it into research studies in the future.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat can we do to protect ourselves from pollution?\n\nIf you live in a big city your options for avoiding air pollution are limited. We still have to go outside and breathe the air, no matter how gross and smoggy it gets.\n\nBut Shruthi says that your risk is dependent on where you are in the world.\n\n\u2018It depends on what kind of governmental structures are in place to reduce emissions or enhance water quality,\u2019 she explains. \u2018This means that someone coming from a country that\u2019s historically tried to optimize air and water quality would receive a very different kind of recommendation from me than someone who might be using wood burning fuel in their home.\u2019\n\nThankfully there are some strategies you can use to minimise your exposure.\n\n\u2018Try to avoid jogging during rush hour on a major roadway,\u2019 suggests Shruthi.\n\n\u2018Avoid jogging during rush hour on a major roadway\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018Make sure your ventilation system in your home is appropriately maintained.\n\n\u2018If you feel like you\u2019ve been experiencing menstrual irregularity you should see your doctor to get a full assessment including a history, a physical hormonal assessment and recommendations.\u2019\n\nWhich pollutants should we aim to avoid?\n\nSome nasty pollutants are easier to avoid than others, but Shruthi has some words of warning about the worst culprits. She says she does her best to avoid air pollutants and pesticides.\n\n\u2018My main concern is limiting exposure to dietary related chemicals,\u2019 she says. \u2018I try to buy organic foods and milk and reduce the chemical burden from what I eat. Also, when I\u2019m driving and get stalled in traffic, turning on internal circulation only, instead of getting exhaust fumes pumped right into the car, is something that\u2019s important to me.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really interesting point that Shruthi makes is about the possibly damaging effects that beauty products can have on our hormones and reproduction \u2013 particularly anti-ageing products.\n\n\u2018A lot of the products that are on the market promote youthfulness or age defying qualities,\u2019 says Shruthi. \u2018Some of those actually can bind to oestrogen receptors to give that oestrogen-dominant look.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s almost like trying to recreate this very hyped-up hormonal state.\n\n\u2018A lot of the products that are on the market promote youthfulness or age defying qualities\u2019 (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\n\u2018So that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m interested in learning more about, especially as cosmetics and personal care products are generally unregulated.\u2019\n\nShruthi says that since beginning her research in this area she has really started to reduce her cosmetic purchases.\n\n\u2018It means redefining what you think of as beautiful and really considering what you need to put on your face and body.\u2019\n\nWhat are the next steps?\n\nWomen have been having menstrual cycles since the origin of the human species \u2013 but people are still scared to talk about it. (Hands up if you still hide your tampons up your sleeve when you go to the bathroom at work so as not to terrify the men\u2026)\n\nStigma and taboo prevents hormonal and menstrual health from being discussed more widely, and Shruthi thinks that really needs to change.\n\n\u2018Work still needs to be done,\u2019 she says. \u2018It\u2019s important to raise the awareness that this is a really key function and shouldn\u2019t be hidden or shamed.\u2019\n\nShe says there\u2019s also a growing awareness that the menstrual cycle is a marker of whole body health, but progress is slow.\n\n\u2018It has been unfortunately understudied and part of that is due to a lack of recognition when it comes to the importance of the menstrual cycle as a key part of the physiology of the body,\u2019 says Shruthi.\n\n\u2018My main goal is to increase awareness about this as we\u2019re introducing new chemicals and technologies into the environment that may not traditionally be included in some of our ingestion or air \u2013 like nanotechnology, or fibres that biodegrade.\n\n\u2018How does this affect the whole ecosystem? What happens if these things get concentrated in our water supply? I\u2019d like to have awareness about women\u2019s reproductive health in the menstrual cycle included in those discussions, as we decide how to handle these chemicals.\u2019\n\nThe intricate link between hormones and pollution is just one of the topics that are going to be covered in depth by a new podcast, Hormonal, created by female health app Clue.\n\nThe weekly podcast, hosted by author Rhea Ramjohn, will explore the different ways in which hormones impact our lives and psyches.\n\nOther topics will include the effects of hormones on your skin and how sexism affects your PMS symptoms.\n\n\u2018Every single person on the planet is affected by hormones, yet relatively few of us know how they work and how they affect our perception of the world around us,\u2019 says Ida Tin, Clue CEO.\n\n\u2018With our podcast, we aim to share some of the knowledge we\u2019ve accumulated through our scientific partnerships and showcase some of the leading experts within the field of endocrinology and female health.\u2019\n\nMORE: Are gyms doing enough to protect members with eating disorders and exercise addiction?\n\nMORE: What is unconscious name bias and why is it so damaging?\n\nMORE: Air pollution is causing baldness and hair loss, scientists claim\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Studies show that the pollutants in the air and the food we eat could be impacting our hormones and reproductive systems in surprising ways.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris", "Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/what-is-cognitive-fog-cognitive-fatigue-and-how-can-you-deal-with-it-78eb_1571151438.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
