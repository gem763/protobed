His hearty laugh \u2014 \u201cAhhhh hahahaha, that thing\u2019s a 6x6 fa\u2019 nothin\u2019!\u201d \u2014 is just too good.\n\nInterestingly, someone named Andrew Wladyka seems to have posted a photo of this truck onto the Oppositetalk Facebook group just hours before the video \u2014 which appears to have originally been posted to Facebook by someone named Pat Phelps \u2014 went viral.\n\nWladyka says the truck \u201crolled into work\u201d just as he was leaving, going on to say that the machine is a true 6x6, acknowledging another commenter\u2019s assertion that it was built by the (now-defunct) company USA 6x6.\n\nI did a bit of digging, and found the video above, which shows how the 6x6 system works on what is almost certainly the exact same truck struggling to make it up the slight incline in Rhode Island.\n\nThere has been a bit of discussion in the Facebook video thread about why the truck had so much trouble considering it has so many tires with which to gain grip. Some claim that the reason why only the back wheels spun had to do with both rear axles sharing a differential (and thus, the axle with the least grip got the power).\n\nBut based on what I\u2019m seeing above, that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case, though admittedly I am not entirely certain how the 6x6 system works. This truck, like other 6x6 conversions (You can read more about how to build a cheap 6x6 here \u2014 I even drew a diagram), basically just involves mating the rear driveshaft \u2014 which normally goes from the back of the truck\u2019s transfer case to the rear axle \u2014 to the back of another transfer case (in this case, what looks like a bulletproof gear-driven NP205, which, incidentally, does not contain a differential).\n\nIn other words, you\u2019re connecting the rear output yoke of one transfer case to the rear output yoke (which is now the front input yoke, since it\u2019s facing forward) of another transfer case. Then, the other side of the second transfer case facing rearward has two outputs, one of which which would normally receive power from the transmission and the other of which would go to the front axle/differential. Instead, one of those feeds power to the middle axle\u2019s diff and the other feeds the rear axle\u2019s diff.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this truck is that, instead of just running a driveshaft or two over the middle axle to attach to the rear diff, there\u2019s actually what appears to be a gearbox fastened to the middle axle. I say \u201cappears to be,\u201d because \u2014 based on pictures of USA 6x6's hardware and on someone named Gonzo Dave\u2019s blog chronicling the build of a 6x6 Jeep CJ-6 \u2014 it\u2019s common in 6x6 builds to bolt a box with a helical 1:1 gear set onto the middle axle.\n\nBut such gearboxes are there so that only a single input shaft from the main transfer case can be used to power both the rear axles. In other words, such a gearbox bolted to the middle axle eliminates the need for a second transfer case. Gonzo Dave describes why he used such a gearbox, saying otherwise he\u2019d have had to use a differential with its own rear output:\n\nIn order to get power from the middle axle to the back one, I had two options. I could use a pass-through low-pinion 9-inch axle in the middle, and another low-pinion axle in the back, or I could use a gear-driven 1:1 transfer box on the middle axle (again with a low-pinion 9-inch), with an \u201cover-the-shoulder\u201d output yoke to power the back axle (with a high-pinion 9-inch). For multiple reasons, I chose the gearbox option, knowing that it would hang down below the bottom of the middle axle\u2019s differential.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe builder of the F-250 from the fail video likely had the same problem as Gonzo Dave in that sending power to the rear axle requires some some sort of \u201cover-the-shoulder\u201d solution, but since the heavy-duty truck has a second transfer case with two driveshafts coming off its back end (and the CJ-6 only has one transfer case), I\u2019m convinced that the box fastened to the rear axle isn\u2019t a gearbox at all, but instead really just a big bracket to help facilitate sending power up and over the second axle, since getting a driveshaft over a moving axle would be tricky.\n\nThe solution is to just have the shaft going to the rear diff attached and moving along with the centre axle.\n\nSo basically, it looks like one driveshaft from the back of the truck\u2019s second transfer case goes directly into the middle axle\u2019s differential, and the other goes into this rectangular \u201cbracket,\u201d which moves with the axle, and which I suppose has some sort of bearing and a yoke on the back side for a driveshaft to the rear diff.\n\nThe point, here, is that the truck in this video was almost certainly in two-wheel drive mode, with neither transfer case \u201cengaged.\u201d In other words, the motor was sending power from its engine, through its transmission, through its transfer case, into the rear output yoke of the second transfer case, and straight through to the other side (which normally corresponds to a transmission input).\n\nTake a peek at the underbody clip and pay attention to where the driveshaft on this \u201cother side (which normally corresponds to a transmission input)\u201d goes. Yep, to the rear axle \u2014 the very one that lit up those tires while trying to climb the hill.", "description": "Everyone loves to see a big, burly truck fail at accomplishing a basic task that even a tiny city car could handle, which is why this video of a six-wheeled Ford F-250 struggling to climb a slight incline is so satisfying....", "authors": ["David Tracy", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/k7q99ywaupjeuscnrjry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
