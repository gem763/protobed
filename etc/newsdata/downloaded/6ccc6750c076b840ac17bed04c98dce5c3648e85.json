Those were her 24th and 25th medals at worlds, surpassing the previous record by Vitaly Scherbo.\n\nScherbo, who competed for the Soviet Union, Unified Team and Belarus at five world championships, had 23. Though he had two more events in which to collect his medals, mind you.\n\nThere was no mic drop when Biles finished floor, as she did to close out the all-around. Instead, she flashed a huge smile and blew kisses to the crowd. Coach Laurent Landi clapped his hands over his head, then gave her a big hug as she came off the podium.\n\nShe leaves worlds with 19 gold medals, extending her own record. It's the first time she's won five golds at the world championships, and will no doubt spark talk of her doing the same at next summer's Tokyo Olympics.\n\nAmerican teammate Sunisa Lee was the silver medalist on floor.\n\nBiles had tied Scherbo on Saturday by winning the vault title. When she saw her score on beam, a 15.066, a huge grin spread across her face and she jumped out of her seat. She threw a roundhouse punch before exchanging high fives and a hug with coach Laurent Landi.\n\nAnd with the record came a bit of redemption.\n\nSimone Biles celebrates after winning the beam apparatus final as second placed China's Liu Tingting looks on at the Gymnastics World Championships.

But a mistake on beam at the Rio Olympics \u2014 her foot slipped on the landing of a front tuck and she had to grab the beam to keep from falling off \u2014 shook her confidence.\n\nA wobbly routine at last year\u2019s world championships didn\u2019t help. She was the bronze medalist in both Rio and at last year\u2019s worlds.\n\n\u201cI was like, 'I guess I\u2019m just never going to do well on beam again,' \" Biles told USA TODAY Sports on Friday in an exclusive interview.\n\nBut Cecile Landi, who coaches Biles with her husband, Laurent, and is responsible for beam, helped Biles regain her swagger. She was the most consistent gymnast on the event, posting the highest score in qualifying, team final and the all-around.\n\n\u201cMy main goal is to go out there and compete beam with confidence, and hopefully do well in that event because I know how strong I am,\u201d Biles said. \u201cEven though I got a bronze, I\u2019m hoping for a little bit better because I know I\u2019m capable of it.\u201d\n\nShe got the upgrade, and the record to go with it.", "description": "Simone Biles became the most-decorated gymnast at the world championships, winning gold on balance beam and floor, her 24th and 25th medals at worlds.", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published A.M.
