'They had nothing to do with the line or how I chose to sing it.'\n\nThey Raisens alleged that they wrote a song called Healthy with Lizzo that featured a near identical line.\n\nThe brothers went further and shared a video to Instagram that overlapped Lizzo's vocals from Healthy and Truth Hurts singing the line.\n\nLess than 100%: Justin and Jeremiah Raisens demanded five percent each for helping create the line, which they claim happened during a songwriting session for a tune called Healthy with the 31-year-old hitmaker in April 2017\n\nIronically, the also admitted they had actually found the line on Twitter, originally penned by British singer Mina Lioness.\n\nMina was the first to accuse the rapper and flutist of pilfering the line in February 2018 who claimed she'd originally tweeted it a year before.\n\nLizzo wrote: 'There was no one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears. That song is my life, and its words are my truth.\n\nShe does concede that Mina was the originator of the phrase and went on to credit her in the post.\n\n'There was no one in the room when I wrote Truth Hurts, except me, Ricky Reed, and my tears. That song is my life, and its words are my truth.' (Lizzo is pictured with the songwriters in a video they previously posted comparing her vocals on the line in Healthy and Truth Hurts)\n\n'I later learned that a tweet inspired the meme. The creator of the tweet is the person I am sharing my success with\u2026not these men. Period.'\n\n'Thank you to everyone who has supported me and my song. XOXO,' Lizzo concluded.\n\nCurrently Lizzo, Ricky Reed, Tele and Jesse Saint John are credited as writers on the song.\n\nThe song topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks straight this year.\n\nAfter the Raisens went public with their allegations, Lizzo's lawyer, Cynthia S.

Arato, denied their claims in a statement to the New York Times: 'The Raisens are not writers of Truth Hurts.\n\n'They did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago.'\n\nLizzo's camp does agree the writing session produced the 'DNA test' line. The dispute lies in who created the lyric.\n\nThe singer's representatives said at the time that she made it on her own, but the brothers say she tailored her voice to the line they created.", "description": "The thank u, next singer, 25, said in a tweet that she had 'the most fun' working with Lizzo, adding an emoji of toasting Champagne glasses.", "authors": ["Adam S.
