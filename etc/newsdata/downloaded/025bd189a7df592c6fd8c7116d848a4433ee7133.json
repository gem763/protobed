But while banks will only pay 80 per cent of suppliers' invoices early, Greensill is willing to pay 100 per cent earlier, minus its financier's fee.\n\nThe fees are based on an annual interest rate and the number of days an invoice is paid early. Under Greensill's terms, if an interest rate is 9 per cent and the invoice is paid 60 days before the due date, the fee is equivalent to 1.48 per cent of the face value of the invoice. The earlier the supplier wants to get paid, the higher the fee.\n\nSuppliers who want to use Greensill's scheme must also sign an agreement allowing the financier to register \"security interests\" associated with receiveables transferred on the personal properties securities register.", "description": "CIMIC is encouraging all its suppliers to pay fees to financier Greensill to get money they are owed by the construction group.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1902%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/465d1bfd56aa65e4cc8d9408350712bfc979373b", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
