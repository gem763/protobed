Venice Beach may need motivating but he does stay well and his confirmed stamina and ability to handle an easy surface will be well served if further showers hit the track.", "description": "SAM TURNER: Cliffs of Moher (Epsom, 4.30) is named in honour of one of Ireland's most picturesque natural wonders and the equine version could be poised to deliver a performance of beauty.", "authors": ["Sam Turner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/02/21/04C5AF24000003E8-0-image-a-63_1496434972758.jpg", "published_at": "2017-06-02"}
