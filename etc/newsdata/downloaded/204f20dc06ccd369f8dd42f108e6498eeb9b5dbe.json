So have big labor unions. The Trump administration has sided with the businesses.\n\nWhat we're watching: The logic of the employers' argument seems likely to appeal to the court's conservative majority.\n\nHolding that federal law doesn't bar sexual-orientation-based discrimination would be a fundamentally conservative ruling both in its politics and in its deference to the legislative branch. That's a sweet spot for Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe employer who fired the trans woman is relying heavily on his religious beliefs, which also tends to find a sympathetic ear at the high court.\n\nThe bottom line: This is just the beginning. The court is diving into these polarizing issues quickly and will keep doing so until next summer.\n\nJust last week, the justices accepted a high-stakes abortion case out of Louisiana.\n\nThey've also accepted their first big Second Amendment case in over a decade.\n\nThey'll hear oral arguments in November over whether President Trump had the authority to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA.\n\nMany of these high-profile rulings will come down next June, and it's hard to think of a set of issues \u2014 abortion, guns, immigration and the legacy of the Kavanaugh confirmation \u2014 that could more fully rile up both parties' bases ahead of the 2020 elections.", "description": "It's one of the specific areas where Kavanaugh's replacement of Anthony Kennedy may make the most difference.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/pCRgJtp9Ir8yvTynlcsYrCjIzmk=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/06/1570394180547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
