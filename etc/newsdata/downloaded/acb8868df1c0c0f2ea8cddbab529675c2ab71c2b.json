But it was nothing.'\n\nThe spot kick, scored by Milner with all-but the last touch of the match, was also disputed by the former Liverpool boss.\n\n'To concede a 95th minute penalty was difficult to take,' said Rodgers. 'We probably deserved a point from the game. We showed our qualities to come from a goal behind.\n\n'We looked like we could go on and win the game. I thought it was a very soft penalty, certainly not clear and obvious.'", "description": "New footage has shown what sparked the huge bust-up at Anfield as Liverpool beat Leicester City, with players from both sides clashing following a penalty kick winner in the dying moments.", "authors": ["Danny Gallagher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/12/19359840-0-image-a-4_1570361690847.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
