He had told the Pentagon over and over again, 'Give me a plan. Tell me how we're going to go into Syria and how we're going to pull out. What does it mean to win? How do we balance out this in the Middle East?' And they couldn't bring him a plan.\"\n\n\"But then they brought him a plan to get Baghdadi,\" she continued. \"And he said, 'Great, let's do this.' And he gave the full force to those Delta Force commandos and to those generals and said, 'when we have them in our line of sight -- when we have actionable intelligence, let's get him and let's take him out.' And that's exactly what they did. And that's far better than what we've seen with past presidents.\"\n\nThe parents of slain aid worker and ISIS prisoner Kayla Mueller echoed that sentiment on Sunday. Marsha Mueller, Kayla's mother, told the Arizona Republic that she believes if \u201cObama had been as decisive as Trump\u201d her daughter may still be alive.\n\nHowever, President Trump's critics did not express the same praise for the commander-in-chief.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden released a statement commending, \"our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals,\" but he criticized Trump's Middle East strategy, by writing, \"the chaos of the past few weeks in northern Syria has jeopardized years of hard work and sacrifice by American and Kurdish troops to evict ISIS from its strongholds in Syria.\"\n\nOlsen said Trump's critics want him to endorse the status quo.\n\nVETERAN SAVES DOG IN AFGHANISTAN WAR ZONE, SNEAKS HIM HOME TO SAFETY\n\n\"The status quo is that America should be the mediator in conflicts between allies and between enemies and allies in these sort of kaleidoscope of interests that ends up involving us in something where we can't win,\" he said. \"The president has always said, 'I'm not interested in that. That's not in our interests. It bogs us [down] in things that we can't do.' And so I look at what the president is doing as being completely consistent with what he said he was going to do.\"\n\n\"What we're seeing here seems to be a really good example of what the establishment has completely derided,\" concluded Hilton, \"which is the America first strategy applied to foreign and security policy.\"\n\nTo watch all of \"Deep Dive\" go to Fox Nation and sign up today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
