This included all HRT, EpiPens and some blood-thinning pills.\n\nIt means drugs in short supply will have to be given to NHS patients, rather than shipped abroad for higher profit.\n\nAny company which breaches the export ban faces a punishment, handed out by the medicines watchdog.\n\nThree other drugs were yesterday added to the export ban including ranitidine, used to treat acid reflux, and the contraceptive medication norethisterone.\n\nDoctors say it has been a \u2018nightmare\u2019 to get hold of, but experts claim Caverject is a \u2018lifesaver\u2019 for many men \u2013 particularly those recovering from prostate cancer\n\nTet Yap, a consultant urologist with London Urology Associates, told The Times: \u2018Supplies of this drug have been intermittent for many years... It is fantastic that the Government has taken some extreme action... For the men who suffer from erectile dysfunction the drug is a real lifesaver.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018It\u2019s used particularly by men who have had surgery for prostate cancer or people who suffer from diabetes. It\u2019s the next step if Viagra doesn\u2019t work. If Caverject doesn\u2019t work, then men need a prosthetic penis and that is an extreme measure that most men aren\u2019t willing to undertake in order to save their sex lives.\u2019\n\nKaren Stalbow, head of policy at Prostate Cancer UK, said: \u2018It is important that action is taken to ensure that these treatments are available for the men that need them.\u2019\n\nA spokesman for Pfizer, which manufactures both Viagra and Caverject, said: \u2018We are aware Caverject has been included on the Government\u2019s list of medicines to protect supplies for patients in the UK.\n\n\u2018We will continue to work with the Department of Health... to support the effective supply of all Pfizer medicines for patients in the UK. We fully recognise the importance of alprostadil to patients in the UK who rely on it and we are working as quickly as possible to rectify the supply issues.\u2019", "description": "Worsening UK shortages mean drugs in short supply will have to be given to NHS patients, rather than shipped abroad for higher profit.
