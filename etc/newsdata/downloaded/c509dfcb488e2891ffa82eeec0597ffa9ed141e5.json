No study can tell you that | Oliver Burkeman", "language": "en", "text": "Is too much screen time bad for your kids? Don\u2019t look to this column for an answer. The truth is, nobody knows. The unceasing pendulum of lifestyle advice is currently swinging through a \u201cdebunking\u201d phase, with numerous articles insisting it\u2019s all been a big panic over nothing. But that\u2019s partly because a report published earlier this year, by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to give firm guidelines to parents. As the paediatricians explained, though, the key problem is that sufficient high-quality research has yet to be conducted \u2013 a conclusion that somehow got turned into this headline, on the parenting website Motherly: \u201cHow harmful is screen time for kids? Not as bad as we may think\u201d. The article was sponsored by the US mobile company Verizon \u2013 though science has yet to inform us if this was a matter of causation or merely correlation.\n\nOf course, there are valid research findings in this area: there\u2019s evidence that excessive childhood TV time is correlated with obesity and poorer mental health, while social media use probably isn\u2019t often a direct cause of teenage depression. And some studies are better designed than others. But neither opponents nor proponents of screen time have much incentive to mention a more unsettling fact \u2013 that it\u2019s almost certainly impossible to know whether too much screen time would clearly damage your kids. The reasons aren\u2019t surprising: human lives are extraordinarily complex things, and no study that aims to say anything meaningful about the population at large can do justice to the innumerable variables at work in your particular family.\n\nSo maybe screen time is bad for your kids, but not as bad as the parenting they\u2019d receive if you didn\u2019t plonk them in front of a screen so you could get a quick nap? Or maybe it\u2019s good, but less good than the alternatives. Some research suggests screen time has powerful educational benefits; but obviously that depends not only on what your kids are watching, but on what they\u2019d be doing with their time if they weren\u2019t glued to the iPad. Maybe social media triggers depression in children only very rarely \u2013 but what if yours is that rare case? And on it goes.\n\nResearchers can control for some of these factors: for example, they try to ensure that when they detect a link between screen time and obesity, they\u2019re not really just detecting effects of poverty. But you can\u2019t control for each human life.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault? That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re off the hook | Oliver Burkeman Read more\n\nNone of which makes this kind of research utterly valueless as life advice; it\u2019s useful as general guidance for what\u2019s likely to lead to good outcomes, all else being equal. But it does mean that anxiously attempting to implement such findings in your life, adjusting your behaviour to each new wrinkle in the science, is a mug\u2019s game. In fact, in the case of parenting, it\u2019s worse than that, because the anxiety you\u2019ll broadcast in your efforts to follow the latest rules might prove just as detrimental to your children as if you\u2019d failed to follow them.\n\nPerhaps we need more research into what happens when parents try too hard to obey parenting research. Maybe sometimes, to paraphrase Philip Larkin, they screw you up, as a direct result of attempting not to.\n\nRead this\n\nIn her 2004 book What Mothers Do (Especially When It Looks Like Nothing), Naomi Stadlen makes the case for not trying to follow other people\u2019s parenting advice.\n\noliver.burkeman@theguardian.com", "description": "Adjusting your behaviour to each new wrinkle in the science is a mug\u2019s game", "authors": ["Oliver Burkeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ea8a1bad7161746c194ebfd27fda1fe70b86ae/0_20_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=19e104b21ab6306f8472b4ff07c13df5", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
