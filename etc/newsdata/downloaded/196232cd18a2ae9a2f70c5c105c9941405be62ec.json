Biden on Wednesday vowed never to let allegations of corruption against himself and his family deter his quest for the 2020 Democratic nomination, accusing President Trump and his \u201chatchet men\u201d of a smear job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Biden will say in a speech in Reno, Nevada, according to excerpts of his prepared remarks released by the Biden campaign.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get,\u201d he says in the speech.\n\nMr. Biden says that \u201cabuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency\u201d and that he stands behind House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nAllegations of corruption involving the Biden family in Ukraine are at the center of a complaint by a U.S. intelligence community whistleblower who accused Mr. Trump of attempting to force Kyiv to investigate Mr. Biden.\n\nMr. Biden as vice president in 2016 threatened to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee from Kyiv unless the country fire its chief prosecutor. At the time, the prosecutor was looking into a Ukraine gas company where Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter had a high-paying job on the board of directors.\n\nMr. Trump requested an investigation in a July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky but did not explicitly proffer a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid, according to a transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\nThe complaint that Mr. Trump abused his Oval Office power to personal political gain spurred the House impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump has insisted he acted properly and the corruption is on the part of Mr. Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s son is corrupt, and Biden is corrupt. And I\u2019d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates,\u201d Mr. Trump said earlier in the day at a joint press conference with the president of Finland.\n\nIn the prepared remarks for the Reno speech, Mr. Biden called Mr. Trump\u2019s actions \u201cdesperate and defensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised Donald Trump asked a foreign government for help to beat me. I\u2019m not surprised the NRA met with Trump to prop him up. And I\u2019m not surprised Trump\u2019s special interest friends are spending millions to attack me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not backing down. And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by the lies, smears, distortions and name calling. I\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment. And I\u2019m going to stay focused on your lives.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cWhat we can\u2019t lose sight of in this election is that this election is about you. Your kids. Your family. And you can\u2019t wait when it comes to health care or jobs or education or guns or climate. The world can\u2019t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
