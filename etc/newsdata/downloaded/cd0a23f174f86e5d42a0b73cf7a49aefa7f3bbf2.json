Now, the owners are apologizing for the apology.", "language": "en", "text": "With the controversy beginning to cut into their profits, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials accusing them of discrimination, the beleaguered owners apologized again at a Monday news conference. This time, they said it had been a mistake to say that selling burritos to ICE employees was a mistake.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are not political,\u201d said one of Lloyd Taco\u2019s embattled co-founders, Pete Cimino. \u201cWhy would we be? How can any business choose sides in our politically divided country and ever hope to succeed?\u201d\n\nDespite Cimino\u2019s fervently expressed desire to remain neutral \u2014 \u201cWe make tacos, not war,\u201d he repeated during the news conference \u2014 Mexican food has emerged as a battleground in the Trump era\u2019s culture wars, often serving as a proxy for immigrants. In 2018, amid widespread outcry over the administration\u2019s family separation policy, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was heckled by protesters while eating dinner at a D.C. Mexican restaurant. Just two months after that, a Mexican restaurant in Houston faced calls for a boycott when the owners enthusiastically welcomed Attorney General Jeff Sessions after he gave a speech calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nTaco trucks, too, have been politicized. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Marco Gutierrez, the founder of Latinos for Trump, claimed that unrestricted immigration would lead to \u201ctaco trucks on every corner.\u201d The line was widely mocked as liberals took the opportunity to argue that the fragrant meats and grilled corn served up by street vendors proved that immigration was a net positive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Buffalo, a Democratic stronghold in Western New York, the flagging Rust Belt economy has been revived by the arrival of new immigrants and refugees. Cimino, who founded Lloyd Taco with his childhood friend Chris Dorsaneo, grew up in the city and has credited its resurgence with their success as food-truck entrepreneurs. After starting out with a single truck during the early days of the food-truck craze in 2010, the two bearded, bespectacled men became a reliable presence at office parks, college campuses and football tailgates, eventually expanding to four trucks, two restaurants and a side business selling soft-serve ice cream.\n\nThe company unwittingly stumbled into the middle of a heated political debate on Wednesday, when it posted an otherwise-mundane tweet listing its trucks\u2019 lunchtime stops. One destination, described only as \u201cDepartment of Homeland Security,\u201d stood out to a few left-leaning burrito enthusiasts who recognized the address as a detention center where undocumented immigrants are held while they await deportation hearings.\n\nCompared with the backlash that would later follow, the initial pushback was fairly mild. Roughly 18 people posted critical responses to the tweet, questioning the decision to serve food to \u201cgovernment bootlickers\u201d and expressing sentiments such as \u201cGuys this really sucks\u201d and \u201cYikes boys I know where I\u2019m not eating again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cY\u2019all hand delivery tacos to ICE agents now? I\u2019d rather eat some sad Chipotle, byyyyyye,\u201d one woman wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, Lloyd Taco posted a profuse public apology on social media, saying that serving lunch at the detention facility was an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d Citing their commitment to hiring immigrant and refugee workers, the owners pledged to donate the day\u2019s sales to Justice For Migrant Families WNY, a local group that advocates for the rights of undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry, Buffalo,\u201d the apology concluded. \u201cYou deserve better.\u201d\n\nSome Buffalonians praised the response, calling it \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201crefreshing.\u201d In a statement, Justice For Migrant Families WNY called the apology proactive, and said the donations would be used \u201cto fund much needed phones and food for immigrants who are currently detained or who have just been released from detention.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut many others were angered by what they saw as an attack on law enforcement, and accused Lloyd Taco of caving to pressure from the left wing.\n\n\u201cIn what world does a company feel the need to apologize for serving food to federal law enforcement officers who work in dangerous conditions?\u201d Rob Ortt, a Republican state senator from the nearby community of North Tonawanda who is currently running for Congress, wrote on Twitter. \u201cPathetic pandering. The men and women who work to enforce our immigration laws and protect us deserve better.\u201d\n\nOn social media, the company was flooded with more than 5,000 responses, nearly all of them angry, Cimino said on Monday. Critics accused Lloyd Taco of \u201csiding with law breakers\u201d and threatened to vandalize the company\u2019s trucks. \u201cYou are a now a discriminatory organization, trying to be \u2018woke\u2019 and appeasing fascist violent misguided leftwing extremists,\u201d read one typical comment. \u201cModerates like my family, once enjoyed your food, but we will never buy from you ever again for your traitorous Anti American Anti Law stance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne man even started a GoFundMe, saying that he hoped to raise $2,500 to throw a free \u201cFood Truck Rodeo\u201d for the detention center guards. As of early Tuesday morning, he had collected $270 in donations.\n\nHow dumb and how weak. Looking forward to the same sanctimonious outrage when \u2066@Wegmans\u2069 sells groceries to ICE workers feeding their families. https://t.co/ogyynU7nSx \u2014 Chris Grant (@sanguinegop) October 24, 2019\n\nICE, too, weighed in, issuing a pointed statement to local media outlets that noted that nearly half the employees at the detention center are veterans.\n\n\u201cWe are doing our jobs, enforcing the laws passed by Congress,\u201d said Thomas Feeley, the Buffalo field office director for ICE. \u201cJust like we have for many Presidents. We will not apologize for doing this, not even to a food truck that now chooses to discriminate against us.\u201d\n\nOnline abuse poured in all weekend \u2014 from both sides, Cimino said. Local TV and radio stations devoted considerable airtime to the controversy, and, amid the uproar, Lloyd Taco saw three of their upcoming stops canceled.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday, the company changed its tune. Calling the initial apology \u201chastily made,\u201d Cimino said they had \u201creacted too quickly\u201d to criticism, and pointed out that they offer a 50 percent discount to anyone in uniform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re big fans of the police,\u201d Cimino said.\n\nAsked if Lloyd Taco would make lunchtime stops at the detention center in future, though, the beleaguered taco entrepreneur refused to discuss what he deemed a hypothetical question. The status of the company\u2019s planned donation to a local migrants-rights group also remains hazy, with both sides claiming that they haven\u2019t heard from one another.\n\n\u201cWe live in divisive times,\u201d Cimino said. \u201cPeople get emotional and feel strongly about issues like immigration policy and social media only magnifies those emotions. But we make lunch and dinner, not policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe company\u2019s apology for apologizing appears to have done little to mollify critics, and, on social media, Lloyd Taco was blasted from both sides for refusing to firmly commit to a stance on federal immigration enforcement.\n\nBut by Monday night, many locals seemed sick of the controversy altogether, with one Twitter user deeming it \u201casinine and ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems Lloyd is trying to stay as apolitical as possible but even trying to sell some tacos gets everyone all worked up,\u201d one Reddit user wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the same hyper-polarized politics we\u2019re unfortunately used to seeing in this day and age.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\"We make lunch and dinner, not policy,\" Pete Cimino, one of the owners of Lloyd Taco, said on Monday.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WqNYD-7i1iGwY3L3DA0nQzVFrBw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OVPGK5QRB5DANJ2T5KUJU75OHI.PNG", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
