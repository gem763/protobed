A further 260 million children are still not in school.\n\nDisadvantage in early education impacts the job market and community productivity.

The two organisations are compiling a more systematic database of existing learning data, ensuring it is comparable across countries, in order to help track trends more accurately.\n\nThe report finds that progress in tackling the gap in literacy is too slow to meet the global goal on achieving quality education for all by 2030. It predicts that at the current rate of improvement, approximately 43% of children aged 10 in 2030 will still not be reading proficiently. Tackling this deficit requires improvements at an \u201cunprecedented\u201d rate and scale, according to the analysis.\n\nJaime Saavedra, global director for education global practice at the World Bank, described learning to read as a \u201cmilestone in every child\u2019s life\u201d. Reading is a foundational skill, \u201ca precondition for active participation in society \u2013 a gateway to all other learning outcomes\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cEliminating learning poverty is as urgent as eliminating extreme poverty, stunting or hunger,\u201d said Saavedra.\n\nThe report acknowledges that education is a human right with \u201cinherent value\u201d, and evaluates its role as a driver of development, growth and competitiveness: lack of fluency in reading can have far reaching consequences for success in learning or the job market. The new target is designed to support countries to develop education systems that young people will leave as \u201cemployable, productive citizens\u201d.\n\nExperts have previously debated whether global targets should be tracked by age or grade. The World Bank\u2019s decision to link their target to age allows the status of children who are not in school to be included.\n\nHow best to tackle disadvantage from early childhood is an ongoing debate in the sector, with some arguing that an indicator on learning in the early years (grades two to three, or ages seven to eight) is crucial to be able to assess where learning can go off track. Others fear this would lead to global testing at too early an age. The People\u2019s Action for Learning, a south-south network, has developed citizen-led ways of assessing basic reading and numeracy competency for younger pupils over the past decade in countries like India, Pakistan, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\nNew data focuses on the effectiveness of education, as well as the number of children in school.

To do so, developing country governments will need more and better support, including financing and world class technical support.\u201d", "description": "Up%20to%2090%25%20of%2010-year-olds%20in%20world%27s%20poorest%20countries%20struggle%20to%20read%20%7C%20Global%20education%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Lucy Lamble"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
