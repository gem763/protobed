If you head over to \u201ccal.new\u201d or \u201cmeeting.new,\u201d you\u2019ll find it takes you to a blank Google Calendar entry, ready for you to fill out its details. It\u2019s a small feature, but it means you don\u2019t have to open up your entire calendar if you just want to add a single meeting.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of Google\u2019s \u201c.new\u201d top-level domains. The company already lets you use them to create G Suite documents (I literally use \u201cdocs.new\u201d every working day), and the company recently extended the functionality to creating Google Keep notes with \u201ckeep.new.\u201d Once you\u2019re in the habit of it, it becomes second nature to hit \u201cCtrl + T\u201d and start typing away in a new document or note, without having to even think about touching your mouse.\n\nWe've got some .new(s) for you: You can now create a new event right from your browser \u2193 pic.twitter.com/mJQ8YwW5CA \u2014 Google Calendar (@googlecalendar) October 24, 2019\n\nGiven how useful I\u2019ve found the feature in the past, I\u2019ve got my fingers crossed that Google adds the functionality to more of its services. As Android Police notes, Gmail is just begging for this feature to be added, and you could even see it being useful for composing new Android Messages if you use its web interface a lot.", "description": "Google has added a new way to quickly create calendar entries when using a browser.
