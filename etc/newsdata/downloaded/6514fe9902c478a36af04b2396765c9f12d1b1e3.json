A U.S. crackdown on capital flows would present a new pressure point in the economic dispute, and could cause disruptions well beyond the tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of products the two sides have levied against each other.\n\n\u201cChinese efforts to enhance reform and opening will be slowed down in the short term, but they will never be stopped,\u201d said Liao Qun, Hong Kong-based chief economist with China Citic Bank International Ltd. \u201cChina could explore European, Southeast Asian and the Belt and Road markets in lieu of the U.S.\u201d\n\nRead more: A QuickTake on China\u2019s financial opening\n\nThe Trump administration is considering measures including delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges, limiting Americans\u2019 exposure to the Chinese market through government pension funds, and putting caps on Chinese companies included in stock indexes managed by U.S. firms., according to people familiar with the internal deliberations.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said in a statement on Saturday that the administration \u201cis not contemplating blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges at this time.\u201d The statement did not address or rule out other possibilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long expected the trade war to spill over into new battlefields, including finance,\u201d said Nick Marro, Hong Kong-based global trade lead at the Economist Intelligence Unit. \u201cThe U.S. enjoys a relatively high degree of asymmetry when it comes to pressuring China here. That said, China is now increasingly interconnected with global markets, meaning that there\u2019s a big risk of blow-back against U.S. companies as part of this strategy.\u201d\n\nExtreme Threat\n\nWhile various Chinese media republished the Bloomberg story and Treasury Department\u2019s statement, they were not immediately seen responding to the deliberations by the Trump administration. The Foreign Ministry didn\u2019t reply to a fax on Saturday seeking comment, while the Commerce Ministry didn\u2019t address the issue at a press conference on Sunday.\n\nTraders in China\u2019s markets will have to decide how to price the risk of the potential U.S. move, which Citigroup Inc. has termed the most extreme threat against China so far in the escalating rivalry between the two economies.\n\nThe CSI 300 Index declined 0.2% as of 9:31 a.m. The moves onshore may be exacerbated by thin liquidity ahead of the week-long holiday, as well as the closing of positions typically seen at quarter-end. The offshore yuan was up 0.1%.\n\nU.S. investment in China\u2019s domestic markets is limited -- residents had $203 billion of long-term mainland Chinese financial assets as of June, little more than double that held in South Africa, according to the U.S. Treasury. Far bigger is the $1.2 trillion market capitalization of Chinese companies on three key U.S. exchanges as of February, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nChina has been accelerating its financial opening in the past two years, promising to lift foreign-ownership caps for securities, mutual fund companies and life insurers by next year. Most recently, regulators scrapped a foreign-investment quota limit, allowing qualified overseas funds to simply register before buying onshore stocks and bonds.\n\nBarring a major economic slowdown or change of course, foreign banks and securities companies could rake in profits of about $9 billion a year in China by 2030, according to an estimate by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Francis Chan and Sharnie Wong. The increasing ties between Wall Street and the Chinese market could make some of its executives important voices for China in Washington.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0China said it would continue to open up its financial markets and encourage foreign investment amid reports the Trump administration is considering restrictions on fund flows to China.\u201cWe", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IKK0l0hu50bjz5AieqhMhw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8d121231e7dbabe9f0179f2b60de60d5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
