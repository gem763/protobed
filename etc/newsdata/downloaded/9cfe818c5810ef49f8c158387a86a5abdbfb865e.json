He didn\u2019t know how long that would take.\n\nDetails of the Wednesday meeting between Barra and top union bargainers were disclosed in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press. It\u2019s an indication that there won\u2019t be a quick end to the nearly monthlong strike by 49,000 workers that has halted production at all of GM\u2019s U.S. factories.\n\nBoth sides are separated on major economic issues such as wages and lump-sum payments and better pensions that will be bargained at the \u201cmain table\u201d by top negotiators.\n\nCommittees are working on issues such as products for factories that GM wants to close, investments in other U.S. factories, and training for union workers to handle future technology, according to Dittes\u2019 letter. They\u2019re also haggling over company-paid legal services for union members and the future of a joint UAW-GM training center in Detroit, the letter said.\n\nBut the company, in a Thursday letter to Dittes, said that GM expected the union to move more quickly and respond to the larger offer before the committee work is done.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting, Mary Barra emphasized the need to get a comprehensive response from the union as soon as possible,\u201d wrote Scott Sandefur, GM\u2019s top bargainer.\n\nDittes wrote that when the committees finish, the union will turn in a comprehensive proposal in response to the company\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cThe completion of those committees is not known at this point,\u201d Dittes wrote, adding that committees have been meeting since 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nWorkers walked off their jobs on Sept. 16 after their four-year contract expired. The strike will be a month old on Monday.\n\nAn analyst estimates that GM is losing $82 million per day, while workers are having to live on $250 per week in strike pay.\n\nThe strike has forced parts supply companies to lay off workers and has made GM close some of its factories in Canada and Mexico.", "description": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra has stepped into contract talks with striking auto workers, asking the union to wrap up", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/10/6a92dd_gm-strike-living-on-84973-yolanda-jacobs-united-auto-workers-member-walks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
