I\u2019ve done so in 4K on my PS4, I\u2019ve replayed it with a suped-up gaming PC with a friend, but I can\u2019t say I ever expected to do it while standing in my kitchen cooking dinner.\n\nThe first time I played the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the Switch was merely a twinkle in Nintendo\u2019s eye. And even back then I hoped with all my heart that Nintendo\u2019s rumoured new console would prove powerful enough to play it. As the little console\u2019s internal specs and systems started to be revealed, drip by drip in early 2017, these hopes were almost certain to be dashed.\n\nThe Switch looked like a fantastic console, I thought, but it would never be able to run a game this dense, this gorgeous, or this intricate. Two and a half years later, consider my hat officially eaten.\n\nFor those who\u2019ve somehow managed to avoid this game since it first launched on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, you\u2019ve missed a treat. Simply put, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best games ever made.", "description": "Hack, slash, chop, blast a fireball, stir my pasta, dodge those lunging talons, taste the bolognese, chop off the monster\u2019s head to collect my bounty.", "authors": ["Jack Rear", "Tom Hoggins", "Laurence Dodds"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gaming/2019/10/18/Witcher3-Switch-Two_witchers_are_always_better_than_one-RGB-en-6-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxAqMfZm9BczZH39X3E8c0tMqeKWRGeCr0k1-nTEfZEA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
