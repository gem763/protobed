database images, such as Driver Licences and passports; crime scene images, including CCTV frames, digital forensics, originals, scans, photocopies of identity documents, and printer ribbons; surveillance images from the likes of police surveillance teams; and what it calls open source imagery, which are photographs and video stills from the internet, such as from social media.\n\nFollowing appropriate legislated guidelines, the document says officers are able to expand searches to externally held databases, such as from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection -- now the Department of Home Affairs.\n\nAll supplied images are enrolled into the AFP's facial recognition system and a search is conducted. The search will generate a list of possible candidates scored according to a computer evaluated similarity to the probe image.\n\nIn addition to using NEC Neoface, the AFP said the tools available to prepare and enhance imagery, both still and video, includes Snipping Tool, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, VLC, Cameras, Scanners, Printers, and Microsoft Paint.\n\nNEC Australia in July commenced legal proceedings against the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) in an attempt to recoup costs and expenses after its contract to deliver the Biometric Identification Services (BIS) project was cancelled in June 2018.\n\nThe AU$52 million BIS project, awarded to NEC Australia, kicked off before the July 2016 creation of the ACIC, which was formed following the merger of the CrimTrac agency, the Australian Crime Commission (ACC), and the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC).\n\nIt was designed to upgrade the agencies' biometrics capabilities from a fingerprint-only solution to also include palm prints and facial recognition.\n\nThe legal action followed a report produced by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) in January that blasted the execution of BIS project, labelling it deficient in almost every way.\n\nAccording to the report, the ACIC's approach was characterised by: Poor risk management; not following, at any point, the mandated process in the contract for assessing progress against milestones and linking their achievement to payments; reporting arrangements not driving action; non-adherence to a detailed implementation plan; and inadequate financial management, including being unable to definitively advise how much they had spent on the project.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The GovNext-ICT contract is for the transformation of the wide area network, local area network, and IP telephony environments across every WA Police Force site.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/01/12/b6374a1f-81f0-4f85-abda-fab3a542eff8/thumbnail/770x578/cb8b5fb7c8e2622875ce81c3fe62f832/nec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
