Again.\n\nThe conference is still providing plenty of highlights and intrigue. No conference is more unpredictable from top to bottom.\n\nIn the College Football playoff era, those are not necessarily good qualities. Being the only Power Five conference without a top-10 team makes it difficult to command the spotlight, but this weekend the Pac-12 has two games with championship implications and maybe even playoff ramifications.\n\nNo. 12 Oregon (5-1, 3-0), the only team in the Pac-12 still unbeaten in conference play, faces No. 25 Washington (5-2, 2-2). The Ducks might be the Pac-12\u2019s best hope to reach the College Football Playoff. Of more immediate importance, Oregon could build a huge lead in the North by beating the Huskies for the second straight season.\n\nIn the Pac-12 South, No. 13 Utah (5-1, 2-1) hosts No. 17 Arizona State (5-1, 2-1) with the winner moving into a tie for first with the winner of Arizona-Southern California. The Utes already have a loss to USC on their resume and another loss will make it tough for the defending South champions to get back to the Pac-12 title game for the second straight season.\n\nRegardless of what happens in Salt Lake City, a Washington victory would leave the Utah-Arizona State winner as the conference\u2019s lone one-loss team.\n\nThe picks:\n\nFRIDAY\n\nNo. 4 Ohio State (minus 28) at Northwestern\n\nRematch of last year\u2019s Big Ten title game and the first Friday night game for the Buckeyes since 1959 \u2026 OHIO STATE 31-7.\n\nSATURDAY\n\nTennessee (plus 34\u00bd) at No. 1 Alabama\n\nTide\u2019s winning streak over the Vols is 12 games and the gap between the rivals is as big as it has ever been \u2026 ALABAMA 48-14.\n\nNo. 2 LSU (minus 18) at Mississippi State\n\nQB Joe Burrow has been near flawless, but LSU\u2019s running game is rolling, too, behind Clyde Edwards-Helaire, a 5-foot-8 junior averaging 6.3 yards per carry \u2026 LSU 38-23.\n\nNo. 3 Clemson (minus 23\u00bd) at Louisville\n\nCardinals\u2019 turnaround this season has been fueled by a big-play offense; Clemson\u2019s defense is a big-play black hole \u2026 CLEMSON 45-17.\n\nWest Virginia (plus 33\u00bd) at No. 5 Oklahoma\n\nMountaineers might be without QB Austin Kendall, an Oklahoma transfer \u2026 OKLAHOMA 56-20.\n\nNo. 6 Wisconsin (minus 31) at Illinois\n\nWill the Illini score? \u2026 WISCONSIN 35-7.\n\nNo. 16 Michigan (plus 9) at No. 7 Penn State\n\nYou know the tune by now: The Wolverines are 0-7 as an underdog under Jim Harbaugh, including five double-digit losses \u2026 PENN STATE 20-14.\n\nNo. 9 Florida (minus 5\u00bd) at South Carolina\n\nGamecocks expect to have QB Ryan Hilinski in the starting lineup after a sprained knee against Georgia \u2026 FLORIDA 24-21.\n\nKentucky (plus 24\u00bd) at No. 10 Georgia\n\nWildcats used WR Lynn Bowden at quarterback to beat Arkansas last week; This is not Arkansas \u2026 GEORGIA 41-14.\n\nNo. 11 Auburn (minus 18\u00bd) at Arkansas\n\nThe Tigers\u2019 passing game ranks 85th in the nation in efficiency rating (129.30), worst among ranked teams \u2026 AUBURN 34-14.\n\nNo. 12 Oregon (minus 3) at No. 25 Washington\n\nRed zone touchdowns have been hard to come by for the Huskies (102nd in the nation at 53.13; the Ducks lead the nation in red-zone defense (two TDs in 14 trips) \u2026 WASHINGTON 20-18, UPSET SPECIAL.\n\nNo. 17 Arizona State (plus 13\u00bd) at No. 13 Utah\n\nSun Devils last four games have been decided by a total of 17 points \u2026 UTAH 24-20, BEST BET.\n\nNo. 14 Boise State (minus 6\u00bd) at BYU\n\nCougars are piecing it together at QB with Zach Wilson injured; Broncos hope to have QB Hank Bachmeier (hip) ready \u2026 BOISE STATE 28-17.\n\nKansas (plus 21) at No. 15 Texas\n\nLonghorns defense has been riddled by injuries and mauled by LSU and Oklahoma; here\u2019s an opportunity to get it together \u2026 TEXAS 45-17.\n\nNo. 18 Baylor (plus 3\u00bd) at Oklahoma State\n\nBears have won four of five against the Cowboys, but that spread says all you need to know \u2026 OKLAHOMA STATE 28-23.\n\nTemple (plus 7\u00bd) at No. 19 SMU\n\nCan the Owls take down a ranked and unbeaten conference opponent two weeks in a row? \u2026 SMU 31-27.\n\nNo. 20 Minnesota (minus 28\u00bd) at Rutgers\n\nScarlet Knights completed five passes for one yard last week.
