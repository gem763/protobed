Michele Mossop\n\nThe paper kicks off a consultation by proposing improvements to council and referral authority processes through early engagement with applicants, removing duplicate requests for information and delivering better response times from the many decision-makers along the planning approvals pipeline. It will feed into an overhaul of the state's Building Act.\n\n\"The proposed improvements focus on eliminating bottlenecks, removing unnecessary steps and making sure approvals processes are as efficient and effective as possible,\" Ms Cronin said.\n\n\"They are practical and implementable and will reduce delays and costs.\"", "description": "Victoria is looking to cut bottlenecks and duplication, while NSW has introduced laws to boost accountability.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/44d6fbc1805e8169476b1b51cdd781c6efc02662", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
