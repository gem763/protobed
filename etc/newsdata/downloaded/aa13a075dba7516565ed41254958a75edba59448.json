They bought it in late 2002 for $1.5 million.\n\nBaerami House was built in 1875 from local sandstone.\n\nBaerami was first taken up in the 1830s by Emmanuel Hungerford, who later gifted it to his son Thomas, a well known pastoralist, politician and at one stage reputedly the country\u2019s largest landholder. More recent owners include barrister and former NSW Legal Profession Disciplinary Tribunal chairman Douglas Staff, QC.\n\nThe grand two-storey homestead was constructed in 1875 from locally quarried sandstone and includes eight open fireplaces, four bedrooms and formal entrance with a red cedar staircase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaerami House will go to online auction on November 12 through rural property specialist Chris Meares of Meares & Associates and is expected to sell in a range of $3.75 million to $4.25 million.\n\n\"This is a unique opportunity to secure a special piece of Australia\u2019s rural history,\" Mr Meares said.\n\nGenerational change\n\nIn the state's south-east, historic grazing and farming property Curry Flat, near Nimmitabel in the Monaro region, is being sold for the first time since settlement by the Jardine family, which has held it for five generations.\n\nCurry Flat has been held by the Jardine Family for five generations.\n\nSelling agent Mr Nolan said price expectations were between $4 million and $4.4 million for Curry Flat, which covers 1262 hectares and is suitable for sheep, cattle, cash and fodder crops.\n\nThe original slab home, built by William Jardine in 1841, still stands on the property, though it has been superseded twice, with the current stone house built in 1866 now the main residence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe property offers excellent versatility in relation to agricultural enterprises, and is equally suited to cattle, Merino wool production and prime lambs,\u201d Mr Nolan said.\n\nAnother property with more than 160 years of family ownership, Briar-Vale near the township of Harden in the South West Slopes, is also being taken to auction on November 12 by Webster Nolan and Elders Gundagai.
