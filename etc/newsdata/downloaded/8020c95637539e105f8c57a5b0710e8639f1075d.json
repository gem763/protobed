McAleenan sought to alleviate fears by declaring that the decision to shift $155 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to border enforcement would have \u201cno impact\u201d on the federal government\u2019s preparedness.\n\n\u201cThere will be no impact of the potential reprogramming on our ability to respond to this storm,\u201d Mr. McAleenan told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe we have fully adequate funding. And no money has actually been moved at this point to begin with.\u201d\n\nActing FEMA director Peter T. Gaynor agreed, saying federal agencies have \u201cplenty of money and resources\u201d to handle the 2017 and 2018 disaster recoveries, as well as Hurricane Dorian.\n\nSuch budget transfers are not uncommon \u2014 then-President Barack Obama did the same thing in 2014 with $277 million in FEMA funds \u2014 but Democrats have pilloried the administration for the budgetary shift.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg called it \u201cunconscionable,\u201d while Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried tweeted President Trump \u201cmust be out of his mind if he thinks it\u2019s a good idea to shift funds out of @FEMA for immigration detention at the border\u201d with Hurricane Dorian looming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really disappointed that President Trump has proposed taking money from FEMA in the middle of hurricane season for walls or cages or militarization of the border that we do not need,\u201d said former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and presidential hopeful on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cAs president, I would fully fund FEMA.\u201d\n\nMr. Gaynor downplayed the transfer\u2019s significance. \u201cWe live with risk every day, we assess risk, we assess that that $155 million is low risk and it is not affecting our preparedness whatsoever for Dorian,\u201d he told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian reached wind speeds of 185 mph as it descended on Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands, with winds expected to reach 220 mph and storm surges forecast at 18 to 23 feet above normal, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nVideo and reports from the Bahamas suggested heavy damage in the archipelago, with roofs blown off, utility lines downed and floodwaters racing through the streets.\n\nOn parts of the island of Abaco, \u201cyou cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins,\u201d Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis told The Nassau Guardian, calling it \u201cprobably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people.\u201d\n\nThe second strongest Atlantic storm on record, Dorian is expected to stall for about 24 hours over the Bahamas before heading for Florida, but the latest tracking models show the storm turning north and moving up the coast instead of crashing into Miami.\n\nEven so, Mr. Gaynor warned residents living near the coast from Florida to North Carolina not to let up their guard.\n\n\u201cThis has been a long duration storm and it hasn\u2019t even touched Florida or the East Coast,\u201d Mr. Gaynor said. \u201cDon\u2019t dismiss this storm. We are not out of it. Life-threatening, dangerous surge, water, wind is coming your way. Take the time to prepare you and your family.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, who canceled a planned visit to Poland to oversee federal efforts, acted Sunday as the nation\u2019s weatherman, tweeting Hurricane Dorian alerts and urging coastal residents to stay safe.\n\n\u201cBe careful! God bless everyone!\u201d he tweeted in all capital letters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the largest we\u2019ve ever seen. Its effects will be felt hundreds of miles or more from the eye of the storm and long before it potentially makes landfall,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a briefing at FEMA.\n\n\u201cWe expect that most of the Eastern Seaboard will be ultimately impacted, and some of it very, very severely,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gaynor said the president is receiving regular updates. \u201cDaily. Hourly. If I\u2019m not talking to his staff, we\u2019re talking to him,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral Florida counties and the city of Jacksonville issued partial evacuation orders for Monday, closing beaches and opening shelters.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster ordered a mandatory evacuation of his state\u2019s entire coast Sunday, affective more than 800,000 people effective noon Monday, when state troopers will begin reversing lanes so that people can all head inland on major coastal highways.\n\nMr. McAleenan said the slow-moving storm is expected to bring rain, wind gusts and power outages to the coastline, even if the hurricane doesn\u2019t make landfall.\n\n\u201cMost models show it stalling out about 60 miles offshore not making landfall,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dangerous. In fact, we expect hurricane-force winds to potentially hit the coast of Florida, and then a prolonged rain event, combined with a storm surge, that\u2019s going to be very difficult as the storm starts to move northward.\u201d\n\nHe added that the previous staffing shorting has been \u201cfixed\u201d and that \u201cwe are ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have 3,000 people already deployed across federal agencies for this storm, about half of those are direct FEMA employees,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
