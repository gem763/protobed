Rafael Reif and signed by 10 staffers and professors, began: \u201cWe are writing you in regard to the available facts on the public record concerning deceased child rapist Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s professional, financial, and personal connections to various MIT faculty and staff.\u201d\n\nReif said last month that MIT took about $800,000 from Epstein over 20 years.\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN'S ECCENTRIC, EXPLICIT TASTE IN ART SEEN IN PALM BEACH MANSION RAID VIDEO\n\n\u201cAs is known, human trafficking is among the largest illegal industries in the world\u2014far eclipsing even the international drug trade. The untold misery this sick and evil institution has inflicted on children and women around the world\u2014and continues to inflict\u2014is incomprehensible,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cWe should like to note that unless MIT takes steps to demonstrate that there are consequences for those who chose to associate with (and thereby enable) Jeffrey Epstein by enriching MIT through his donations, there can be no rational hope for thinking that these sorts of sex crimes against women and children will end.\u201d\n\nJoi Ito, director of MIT\u2019s Media Lab, resigned from both the lab and from his position as a professor at the Cambridge school. The resignation was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nIto\u2019s resignation came after The New Yorker reported that the Media Lab had a more extensive fundraising relationship with Epstein than it previously acknowledged and tried to conceal the extent of the relationship.\n\nIto said Epstein gave him $525,000 for the Media Lab and another $1.2 million for his own investment funds.\n\nThe letter continues: \u201cIndeed, unless MIT and other institutions of higher education take accountability for their actions by punishing those involved for associating with Epstein, the public has no reason to grant institutions as MIT any moral or civic credibility. Failing to do anything of real consequence is an insult to common sense and basic human decency.\u201d\n\nKim Holleman, a contemporary artist who was a research affiliate at MIT Media Lab with the Social Computing Group (2014-2017), signed the letter, and told Fox News via email: \u201cThe levels of corruption and hypocrisy amongst these people is absolutely astounding. As more and more gruesome details emerge about Epstein\u2019s life, and revelations from the personal blog posts supporting child rape and child pornography by MIT\u2019s (Richard) Stallman, it becomes more and more believable that not only did all these men know about Epstein\u2019s life raping women, they most likely personally approved of it. That is the most plausible conclusion, and it\u2019s the most disgusting aspect of all.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis is about justice for the victims that these men had no concern for, even as other men at MIT suggested they were \u2018willing participants\u2019 in grotesque exploitation, sex trafficking, and rapes. Attorney General William Barr promised that Epstein\u2019s conspirators would be brought to justice, which shows more compassion for Epstein\u2019s victims than was ever shown by these men at MIT, who instead were profiting from Epstein and his despicable and illegal crimes against girls and children.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEpstein\u2019s July 6 arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed him to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges.\n\nEpstein was a wealth manager who hobnobbed with the rich, famous and influential, including presidents and a prince.\n\nHe owned a private island in the Caribbean, homes in Paris and New York City, a New Mexico ranch and a fleet of high-price cars.\n\nEpstein, 66, killed himself in jail Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Federal prosecutors in New York had charged him with sex trafficking and conspiracy, alleging he sexually abused girls over several years in the early 2000s.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "In a letter obtained by Fox News, faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are demanding to know the full extent of its financial ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
