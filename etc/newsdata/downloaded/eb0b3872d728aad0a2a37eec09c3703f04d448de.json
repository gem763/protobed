How?,' Rachael told FEMAIL at the time.\n\nThe couple had been undergoing five separate and 'gruelling' rounds of IVF in an 'attempt to continue' their family.\n\n'All I want to do is go to bed and not wake up until the world treats us fairly,' Rachael said.\n\n'Until I am pregnant with a baby I can keep.\n\n'I am so sick of sharing pain, I want to share happiness and love.'\n\n'We cannot fully describe in words the pain we felt and are still feeling over losing our beautiful daughter, our heartbreak transcends language,' Rachael (pictured with Jonny) said\n\nThe policewoman (pictured with baby Mackenzie) said a part of her 'died that day' and it has never been the same\n\nWHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SMA? * There are four types of SMA, categorised by the disease's severity and the age at which symptoms begin. * Type I, sometimes called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, begins to affect infants from birth up to 6 months of age, with most babies showing signs of the disease by 3 months. Some develop the disorder before birth. This is the most severe form of SMA. * Type II, also called chronic infantile SMA, begins to affect children between 6 and 18 months old. This form can be moderate to more severe. * Type III, also called Kugelberg-Welander disease or juvenile spinal muscular atrophy, begins to affect kids as early as 18 months of age or as late as adolescence. This is the mildest form of SMA in children. * Type IV, is the adult form of the disorder. Most people affected by this type start having symptoms after age 35, and these symptoms slowly get worse over time. Because it develops slowly, many people with Type IV SMA don't know that they have it until years after symptoms begin.

It was so cute, she was trying to figure out what it was.'\n\nThe proud parents also took Mackenzie to Broome where she had her first and only trip in a helicopter:\n\n'She was so funny in the helicopter. I had her strapped to me and I just remember she looked so confused,' Rachael said.\n\nOn Sunday 22 October 2017, Mackenzie passed away surrounded by her family.\n\n'A part of us died that day,' Rachael said. 'She lived a life filled with nothing but love and laughter.\n\n'We cannot fully describe in words the pain we felt and are still feeling over losing our beautiful daughter, our heartbreak transcends language. But we will be forever grateful to her for what she taught us and the love she gave us.'\n\nSince their little girl's heartbreaking death on October 20 two years ago, the couple (pictured) has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of SMA\n\n'Four our of five children born with a genetic disorder have no family history at all,' Rachael said (pictured: baby Mackenzie)\n\nSince their little girl's heartbreaking death on October 20 two years ago, the couple has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of SMA and to spare other families from the agony they have endured.\n\n'It's strange, but campaigning for me has been hugely cathartic,' Rachael said.\n\n'We just want to raise awareness as the statistics are so scary. All people are carriers for genetic disorders, but genetic testing is only carried out on couples that have a family history of such disorders.\n\n'Four our of five children born with a genetic disorder have no family history at all.'\n\nRachael highlighted Prepair's screening test as something for would-be parents to find out whether their child might be in possession of CF, FXS or SMA.", "description": "A couple who lost their first baby at just seven months old and later found out that their second unborn daughter would have the same fatal condition have turned to the Internet to help them start a family.", "authors": ["Sophie Haslett For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/00/20108936-0-image-a-21_1571873778622.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
