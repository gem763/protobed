Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue dropped 0.6%.\n\nThe Armonk, New York-based technology services giant, which wrapped up the mega cloud merger with Linux maker Red Hat Inc earlier this year, has faced years of revenue declines in the process of shifting focus to the cloud from traditional business.\n\nGinni Rometty, IBM chief executive for more than seven years, has been able to steer the company towards fast-growing cloud-computing business and lower its dependence on its traditional hardware products, but not without a bumpy journey. The newer areas of focus have sometimes underwhelmed investors.\n\nWith the Red Hat deal, the company's biggest so far, IBM is looking to expand its subscription-based software offerings to counter falling software sales.\n\nIBM's global technology services segment, the company's biggest, reported $6.70 billion in revenue, down 5.6% from a year earlier.\n\nNet income fell to $1.67 billion, or $1.87 per share, from $2.69 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the company earned $2.68 per share, 1 cent above analysts' expectation.
