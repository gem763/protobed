I would never have come to Liverpool, likely, and I would certainly never have entertained the thought of purchasing a property here.\n\n'But it was because of that and going through something like that, that your whole perception of life changes.\n\n'I never thought I would ever meet John's family and they wanted to visit - they hadn't been here in nearly 50 years.'\n\nDespite not being a particular fan of the Beatles, the retired nurse has filled the house with carefully thought memorabilia and some never seen before pictures provided by Lennon's family\n\nIn the back garden there is also a soundproof recording studio, where bands and artists can record their songs or just want to chill out and play some tunes\n\nThe furniture is set in the way the Beatle's family had it when they lived there, with frames and plaques to explain the artifacts placed around the home\n\nThe home was due to be listed on Host So Simple - an AirBnB Management in Liverpool.
