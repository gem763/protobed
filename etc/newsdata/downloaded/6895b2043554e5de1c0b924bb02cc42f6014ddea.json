It's expected to make landfall next week in Florida, Georgia or the Carolinas.\n\nWith the storm nearing a Category 5, experts hope it comes nowhere near the level of devastation caused by the Great Hurricane of 1935, when hurricanes weren't given names. It killed up to 600 people and is considered the worst of the storms in the area.\n\nImage 1 of 2 \u25bc In this undated photo made available by the Keys History & Discovery Center, shows damage caused by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935.

The hurricane is still the most powerful to strike the U.S. More than two doz Expand\n\nOther Category 5 storms to hit the U.S. caused billions of dollars in damages.\n\nLast year, Hurricane Michael killed at least 59 people in the Florida area, leaving $25 billion in repairs; Andrew killed 65 people in August 1992, with a $27 billion clean-up for the state; and Camille struck the Louisiana-Mississippi region killing more than 250 people, causing $10 billion in damage in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "More than two dozen have hit the region during the holiday weekend since 1851.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/NASA-Hurricane-Dorian.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
