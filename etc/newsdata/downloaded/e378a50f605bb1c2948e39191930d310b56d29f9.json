Those two victories meant that for the first time Los Lelos qualified for the subsequent World Cup by virtue of a top 12 finish, which meant their coach, Milton Haig, had a chance to test younger players in the Rugby Europe Championship. The last four years were spent improving competition in several key positions, such as fly-half and second row.\n\nGeorgian rugby is largely dependent on two groups \u2013 players who play in France or Britain and their under-20s team, who managed to maintain their place among the best 12 in the world for the past four years, defeating Italy, Scotland, Argentina and Ireland in the process. As a result, it is no surprise that the senior team consists of experienced players such as Davit Kacharava who has 115 caps to his name and 18-year-old hooker Vano Karkadze.\n\nHaig is quite happy with preparations and said that the physical condition of his players is at least 25% better than it was in 2015. Despite that, the Georgian team did not look great against the Pro 14 Southern Kings, who were close to upsetting home side in Tbilisi.\n\nThe worrying signs continued when Los Lelos hosted Scotland in August \u2013 the first Tier 1 team to ever visit Tbilisi. Usually, the Georgian defence holds its own even against high-level teams \u2013 in November 2017 they narrowly lost to Wales \u2013 13-6 \u2013 at the Principality Stadium. Many Georgian fans got their hopes up, that maybe, just maybe, their team could play at Six Nations level. That optimism largely dissolved when Scotland managed to score five tries in the Dinamo Arena while conceding just one.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s big men can match even top opposition when it comes to scrummaging, but when it\u2019s time to clear out rucks and support teammates, they\u2019re often a bit too slow, which showed on several occasions against Southern Kings and Scotland. Discipline is another thing Los Lelos need to sort out. Georgia conceded 14 penalties against Scotland which cost them dear.\n\nMost of the Georgian backs play in the semi-professional domestic competition (Didi 10) and do not always have quality opposition to hone their skills against. Haig included 17 forwards and 14 backs in his squad and Georgian fans were happy when they saw that Mamuka Gorgodze was selected. The Toulon second-row retired from his international duties in 2017 and was adamant he would never play for Georgia again. He told reporters it was time for younger guys to step up, but with Giorgi Tsutskiridze ruled out through injury, \u201cGorgodzilla\u201d had no other choice.\n\nGeorgia play their first game on 23 September against Wales. The second game will be against Uruguay, whom Los Lelos lost to at the World Cup in 2003 and Haig is planning to win this one. After just four days of rest the Georgians then face Fiji. If they\u2019re to replicate 2015, Los Lelos need to come away with a victory. The teams have faced each other three times and the Fijians emerged victorious twice. Georgia have previously faced Australia so, in a way, whatever happens in the last game of the group stage, it will make history.\n\n\u2022 Luka Chochua is a sports Journalist and TV host working for the public broadcaster of Georgia", "description": "A blend of experience and youth makes up an injury-hit Georgian squad that has brought \u2018Gorgodzilla\u2019 out of retirement", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc7623d9ffb5bea3ab228f8081df419e5c6bb766/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=492fbd34fee67d23a8c8e3e0a4087193", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
