It is given in the memory of immigrant, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and dedicated conservative activist Henry Salvatori.\n\n\u201cAt a time when many journalists\u2019 reporting simply falls in line with a preordained narrative, Mollie\u2019s reports have been guided by her relentless pursuit of the truth,\u201d said Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James. \u201cShe has remained committed to the facts \u2013 and has had the courage to defend them \u2013 in covering some of the year\u2019s most contentious stories, including Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination fight and Bob Mueller\u2019s independent counsel investigation.\"\n\n\u201cThanks to Mollie\u2019s journalistic integrity and willingness to stand alone beside the truth, the American people are better informed and better equipped to see through an increasingly doctrinaire news media,\u201d James continued. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Founding Fathers understood the importance of a vigorous, independent press and warned that freedom would be a \u2018short-lived possession\u2019 without an informed public. It is for this reason that The Heritage Foundation awarded Mollie its Salvatori Prize for American Citizenship.\u201d\n\nHemingway is a senior editor at The Federalist and Senior Journalism Fellow at Hillsdale College. A Fox News contributor, she is a regular member of the Fox News All-Stars panel on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d Her work has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Los Angeles Times, , The Washington Post, CNN, National Review, GetReligion, Ricochet, Christianity Today, Federal Times, Radio & Records, and many other publications. Hemingway was a 2004 recipient of a Phillips Foundation Journalism Fellowship and a 2014 Lincoln Fellow of the Claremont Institute. She is the co-author of the forthcoming book \u201cJustice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\"Henry Salvatori was man who derived remarkable benefits from the American constitutional system, and then gave so much back so that others could thrive,\u201d said Hemingway. \u201cI am both thrilled and humbled to receive an honor in his name and grateful to The Heritage Foundation for continuing his remarkable legacy.\"\n\nPrevious Salvatori Prize recipients include Tucker Carlson, The Washington Free Beacon, and The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.", "description": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2013 The Heritage Foundation awarded its 2019 Salvatori Prize for American Citizenship to journalist Mollie Hemingway for her work protecting and advancing American values.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
