Young candidates presuming they are better suited, despite less experience. Young workers being promoted as older workers are dismissed. This type of thing happens every day in American society, where, by next year, it is projected that 17% of our population will be over 65.\n\nSeventeen percent. That\u2019s a good deal larger than our African-American or Asian populations, and nearly the same size as the entire Hispanic population.\n\nYet the issue of age discrimination is only whispered about, as if part of that stupid assumption that older people can\u2019t hear. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s insulting. If you deride, don\u2019t hire, or dismiss people based on their age, it\u2019s a prejudice. Yet it doesn\u2019t seem to invoke the anger that other biases do.\n\nWhy? Well, let\u2019s face it. We live in a society that worships youth. Our entertainment chases teenage viewers (just count the comic-book movies). Advertisers have little interest in people over 50. Products to remove wrinkles or grey hair fly off the shelves. \u201cThe youngest to ever\u201d is a coveted title in work, politics, and law, while \u201cthe oldest to ever\u201d is usually reserved for human-interest stories, like an 80-year-old marathoner, or the 74-year-old Indian woman who recently gave birth to twins.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mitch Albom", "Freep.Com Story Sports Columnists Mitch-Albom Mitch-Albom-Joe-Biden-Age"], "top_image": ""}
