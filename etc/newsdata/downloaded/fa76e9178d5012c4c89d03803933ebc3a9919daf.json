Public Schools\u2019 budget has a hole that\u2019s at least $23 million deep.\n\nIt\u2019s time for parents and other taxpayers to adopt the erstwhile financial control board\u2019s cardinal rule, because here\u2019s what happens when school funding doesn\u2019t follow students into their classrooms. The central bureaucracy sucks it up, and \u2014 worse \u2014 the educrats bleed the system and create a deficit.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what has happened in D.C. Public Schools, even though a prolific outside bean counter named Mary Levy warned top D.C. officials in 2018 that semantics was making it nearly impossible to decipher who was working on behalf of students and who was working on behalf of the system.\n\nFor example, Ms. Levy pointed out that someone who works in \u201cinstructional support\u201d might not be a teaching assistant in a classroom with students but a DCPS employee who works in \u201cprofessional development.\u201d\n\nD.C. Auditor Kathy Patterson issued a similar warning a few months back, saying that funds and programs that were specifically designed for at-risk students were being used for other purposes.\n\n\u201cSchools with the highest proportion of at-risk students in D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) have had their base funding cut and at-risk funds used for teacher and social worker pay instead of for added efforts to improve academic achievement,\u201d Mrs. Patterson said. \u201cIn addition, high schools with large populations of students with disabilities have not received funding required by local and federal law, with at-risk funds also used to meet special education staffing requirements.\n\n\u201cAs serious as how the funds have been misused is the issue of how they have not been used \u2014 not according to a strategy or a plan that can be tested and tweaked and improved so that we are actually getting to the issue of achievement,\u201d the auditor said.\n\nThose three sentences cut to the heart, with the mayor holding the reins of the D.C. school system and the D.C. Council failing to hold itself accountable for its oversight.\n\nWhen a hen roosts over the henhouse, the rooster never crows.\n\nThat might sound, well, distasteful, but it\u2019s true.\n\nThe D.C. chief financial officer isn\u2019t sounding off about the deficit.\n\nThe deputy mayor for education isn\u2019t complaining about the deficit either. In fact, the deputy said everyone should \u201ccalm down\u201d because things aren\u2019t as bad as they appear.\n\nThe mayor, meanwhile, pops around the District \u201cinvesting\u201d in her policies as if she\u2019s spending Jeff Bezos\u2019 billions.\n\nA denizen of City Hall once told me to never believe what \u201cthey\u201d say about schools. \u201cThe books are cooked.\u201d\n\nPolitically, the cooking is deemed \u201creprogramming.\u201d\n\nMrs. Patterson served as a member of the D.C. Council from 1995, when Mr. Clinton OK\u2019d the control board, until 2007. The board was suspended by law 18 years ago on Monday \u2014 the same day city officials claimed that the DCPS deficit had been cut by $13 million since this summer.\n\nWhat a feat \u2014 if you believe the numbers.\n\n\u2981 Deborah Simmons can be contacted at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
