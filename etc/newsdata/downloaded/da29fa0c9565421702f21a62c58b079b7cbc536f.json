From statement pieces to fun little accents, we\u2019ve got it covered.\n\nWe kept an eye on price \u2013 as anyone who has ever hosted one knows how the cost of a child\u2019s party can rack up \u2013 but also on whether things could be used again, and whether these decorations would appeal to a wide age range.\n\n\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

However, our enthusiasm for these colourful vessels which hang, ready to be hit open and release all sorts of bounty, is plentiful. This flamingo, made from cardboard and pink tissue paper, is a bit of a masterpiece. You\u2019ll find children make a beeline for it, prodding and poking at the fun-filled bird before the whacking commences.\n\nWe found it easy to assemble \u2013 even at speed, and you don\u2019t need to faff about with glue. It doesn\u2019t come with a stick, so we found a wooden spoon did the trick. You will need to fill it with sweets and treats yourself, but we\u2019re happy to say this pinata survived not one but two parties of overexcited three-year-old revellers. A sturdy showstopper.\n\nBuy now\n\nUnique Party circus carnival party game: \u00a32.99, Party Pieces\n\nA reworked version of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey, this game \u2013 where peanuts are fed to the circus elephant \u2013 is cheap, cheerful and guaranteed to bring an element of healthy competition to any party. The peanuts are numbered so whoever places theirs closest to the elephant\u2019s trunk is declared the winner. Simple thrills. And it can be reused again and again. You\u2019ll need to find your own blindfold, though.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nHobbycraft hanging paper fans: \u00a33.50, Hobbycraft\n\nPaper decorations add texture and colour to any space. We hung these from an apple tree, much to the delight of a gaggle of three year olds. They serve no purpose other than to look whimsy and jolly \u2013 and that\u2019s a very important aspect of decking out a party. Very cheap, too.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nBubblegum Balloons set of six foiled leopard inflated balloon wands: \u00a320, Bubblegum Balloons\n\nThere are infinite choices when it comes to selecting balloons \u2013 but safe to say anything big, shiny and shaped like an exotic animal is likely to go down well at a children\u2019s party. We plumped for the leopards but there are also the likes of lions, princesses, tractors and flamingos to choose from. These arrive fully inflated, so you don\u2019t need to even think about the stress of helium canisters.\n\nWe just popped the end of the stick into the wand head on the balloon, and we were all set. We really liked that these could be used as decorations \u2013 they work well as a centrepiece on a table filled with party food \u2013 but that could then be shared out and taken home as favours. These balloons come in bunches of six and are attached to wands rather than string. We found these lasted and lasted \u2013 five days and counting.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nRex London mini tutti frutti garland: \u00a36.95, Rex London\n\nThis garland is simply delightful. It\u2019s comprised of seven different paper honeycomb fruits, including cherry, lemon and pineapple measuring approximately 11 x 6cm each. We strung this up above a party table where it was admired for its bright, inviting charm. There are two unexpected bonuses to this garland.\n\nThe first is that you have to assemble the fruits yourself and attach them to the string. This proved to be an excellent and absorbing activity for the couple of seven years\u2019 olds who were given this task. The second is that once the party is over, the fruits can be neatly folded down flat and stowed away for the next party.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nMeri Meri silver star candles: \u00a38.25, Meri Meri\n\nWhy have normal candles when they could be star-shaped and glitter encrusted? We loved these beautiful candles which come in a pack of six, two large and four small. They burned evenly, steadily and add a little something extra special to any cake.\n\nBuy now\n\nRex London vintage kids cake decorations: \u00a34.95, Rex London\n\nThese cake decorations will add a hearty dose of nostalgia to any confection \u2013 so long as it doesn\u2019t have a diameter any longer than 30cm. The pack includes one cake bunting, four cake toppers and one cake frill \u2013 and is absolutely essential if you are in no way akin to Mary Berry when it comes to getting your bake on. All of this colourful paper and wood will hide a multitude of culinary sins including soggy bottoms, burnt edges and lumpy icing. If you\u2019re careful, you\u2019ll be able to reuse it.\n\nBuy now\n\nPretty Little Party Shop party horns: \u00a32.99, Pretty Little Party Shop\n\nAddictive, underrated, slightly annoying and but completely essential. The party horn. Available in packs of four, these horns measure eight inches and are really lovely to look at \u2013 with pastel shades with gold accents. We found these to be effortlessly loud \u2013 which did the job!\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nHobbycraft gold foil polka dot party boxes: \u00a34.50, Hobbycraft\n\nThese boxes are really lovely \u2013 and very roomy too at 15 x 19 cm. Available in packs of five, they are easy to assemble and are made of quality card, so they feel strong and secure. We really liked how children couldn\u2019t easily peer inside them, which added an extra element of surprise.\n\nBuy now\n\nPretty Little Party Shop bespoke balloon garland installation kit: \u00a329.99, Pretty Little Party Shop\n\nThis looks like the work of professionals, but actually making a balloon garland requires no expertise, or even experience. There are two kits to choose from. One smaller \u2013 the 2.5 metre kit which contains 25 11 inch balloons and 40 five inch balloons as well as installation tape. The five metre kit contains double the number of balloons. In terms of colour \u2013 you\u2019re the boss, and can choose up to six shades.\n\nThere are also instructions as how best to arrange your garland, although part of the fun is making it personal. With older children, this proved to be a really fun and bonding activity. We made an arch which actually looked pretty good if we say so ourselves. There were a few popping casualties but thankfully a few spare balloons were provided so it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. The hardest part was blowing up the balloons. Word to the wise \u2013 get a balloon pump!\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nPeter Rabbit party kit: \u00a320.99, Party Delights\n\nThere are few things more delightful to small children than Peter Rabbit and pals. This all-in-one party kit caters for 12 guests and includes, plates, cups, napkins and a gorgeous hanging garland. Often disposable tableware can look and feel cheap \u2013 flimsy and prone to leaks \u2013 but we found the quality of this kit to be very good.\n\nThe scalloped edges of the plates were lovely and less every day than a simple round plate. The napkins were also thick and absorbent. The illustrations were detailed, clear and the colours deeply saturated. We recommend serving carrots and other produce snaffled from Mr McGregor\u2019s garden before everyone tucks into cake.\n\n\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Kids' party decorations\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like comparing apples and oranges, but we think the flamingo pinata has to win the day. It\u2019s beautiful, fun and a real centrepiece.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
