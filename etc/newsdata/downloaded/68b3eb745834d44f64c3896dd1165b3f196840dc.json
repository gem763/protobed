President Obama would fly to Hawaii.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump played golf twice last weekend at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, after canceling a trip to Poland to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II. He said he wanted to remain in the U.S. to monitor the massive storm threatening the southeast coast, and sent Vice President Mike Pence in his place.\n\nMr. Khan attended the ceremonies in Poland.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s clearly busy dealing with a hurricane out on the golf course,\u201d Mr. Khan told Politico of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe mayor also criticized Mr. Trump as \u201ca guy who amplifies racist tweets; amplifies the tweets of fascists; says things that are deeply objectionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t stand up and call that out I think I\u2019m doing a disservice to Londoners who chose me as their mayor,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said Mr. Khan \u201cshould focus on \u2018knife crime,\u2019 which is totally out of control in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are afraid to even walk the streets. He is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president and London\u2019s first Muslim mayor have traded insults for three years. Mr. Trump has referred to him as a \u201cstone-cold loser.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
