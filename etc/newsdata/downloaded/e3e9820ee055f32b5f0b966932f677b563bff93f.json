(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) | Evan Vucci/AP Photo White House Ukrainian leader bristles at release of Trump transcript\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The White House annoyed and embarrassed Ukraine\u2019s president by releasing his comments in a private conversation with President Donald Trump \u2014 and may have violated the Ukrainian constitution.\n\nThe rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy released Wednesday shows that Trump pressed Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d his Democratic political rival Joe Biden. The July 25 call is now at the center of a U.S. impeachment probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think such things, such conversations between heads of independent states, they shouldn\u2019t be published,\u201d Zelenskiy told reporters at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. He didn\u2019t indicate whether the White House warned him that his comments would be released.\n\nBut he also said that \u201cno one can pressure me.\u201d He sought to play down the situation involving Biden and his son\u2019s activities in Ukraine, calling it just one of \u201cmany cases that I talk about with leaders of other countries.\u201d\n\nBefore the White House released the rough transcript, Trump tweeted that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had received permission from the Ukrainian government to do so. \u201cThey don\u2019t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday.\n\nUkrainian legal expert Roman Marchenko said if the Ukrainian government didn\u2019t give its approval, the release could have violated constitutional protections of privacy in correspondence and phone calls. \u201cWhat Trump did (in publishing the rough transcript) is a violation of Ukrainian laws,\u201d Marchenko told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office, the office of former President Petro Poroshenko and other Ukrainian government officials wouldn\u2019t comment to The Associated Press on the transcript or Biden on Thursday.\n\nWhile the transcript was a bombshell for U.S. politics, it didn\u2019t dominate the media landscape or daily conversation in Ukraine, where many are disillusioned with politics, corruption and Ukraine\u2019s struggling economy.\n\n\u201cI think that Trump may put pressure on Ukraine, because the U.S. gives a huge amount of money to support Ukraine,\u201d said Kyiv resident Serhiy Cheshyr.\n\nTaras Semenyuk, political expert at the KyivStratPro consulting company, said the assumption that investigations can be ordered from on high \u201cis a result of the weakness of our institutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe situation is very unpleasant for Ukraine. Ukraine loses its reputation,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on a Ukrainian gas company\u2019s board at the same time his father as vice president was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But the rough transcript summarizing the call shows Trump repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy to work with the U.S. attorney general and Trump\u2019s personal attorney to investigate Biden.\n\nThe call is the subject of a whistleblower complaint against Trump and the basis for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nZelenskiy tried to smooth over tensions with Germany and France after the transcript revealed critical comments about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for any assistance to Ukraine from our European leaders, from Ms. Merkel, from Mr. Macron, and from others,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he maintained his criticism of the Nord Stream 2 project for a pipeline to send Russian gas to Europe. He called it \u201ca big threat to our energy security\u201d and said Ukraine would lose billions of dollars.\n\nMerkel\u2019s office refused to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks in the transcript that the German leader \u201ctalks Ukraine, but she doesn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Germany\u2019s Foreign Ministry provided figures disputing Trump\u2019s account, telling The Associated Press that since 2014, German direct support to Ukraine amounted to 1.18 billion euros, in addition to another 200 million euros through European Union support.", "description": "If the Ukrainian government didn\u2019t give its approval, the release could have violated the country's constitutional protections of privacy, one legal expert says", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/13/57f9292c4a20975a0a9b395e8de2/190925-trump-zelensky-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
