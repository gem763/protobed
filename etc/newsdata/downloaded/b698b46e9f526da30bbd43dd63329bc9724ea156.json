(Picture: EPA)\n\nHow many votes does he need?\n\nThere are 650 seats in the House of Commons. The Speaker, John Bercow, and his three deputies will not vote.\n\nSinn Fein\u2019s seven MPs do not take their seat in Westminster on political grounds.\n\nAssuming every other MP votes, then Boris Johnson needs to get 320 votes to give his deal a majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho will vote for it?\n\nThe majority of Tories are on board and indeed backed previous versions of the deal put forward by Mr Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May.\n\nThere are 287 Tories but a number of the hardcore Tory Brexiteers could be swayed by the DUP\u2019s decision to reject.\n\nLeader of the hardline European Research Group (ERG) Steve Baker is playing his cards close to his chest but other members \u2013 including Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 have made positive noises.\n\nThis leaves Mr Johnson trying to win over Labour rebels and some of the 21 Tories that he sacked when they voted to make a no-deal Brexit illegal.\n\nEarly reports suggest he has 303 people on board \u2013 short of 17.\n\nBoris cannot rely on the support of Jeremy Corbyn (Picture: AFP)\n\nWho won\u2019t vote for it?\n\nThe SNP has 35 MPs and say they will vote down Mr Johnson\u2019s deal. The Lib Dems 19 politicians will also reject it.\n\nCrucially, the DUP \u2013 former allies of the Tories \u2013 have also said they will reject the new deal because it keeps Northern Ireland still tied to a number of EU trade rules.\n\nThe Independent Group for Change (TIG) now has five MPs, made up of anti-Brexit Labour and Conservative defectors. They are pushing for a second referendum and won\u2019t vote in favour.\n\nPlaid Cymru\u2019s four MPs and the Green Party\u2019s Caroline Lucas have also said they will vote against the plan.\n\nLabour\u2019s 242 MPs have been ordered to vote against the deal.\n\nHowever, there are nine who are likely to rebel and back the plan while a further 15 are said to be undecided.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly reports suggest there are 301 confirmed to oppose Mr Johnson.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg will back his friend Mr Johnson (Picture: AFP)\n\nAre there any who haven\u2019t made up their minds?\n\nThere are 15 Labour MPs who are yet to decide what to do and around 14 Tories.\n\nThe Labour MPs are in Leave constituencies and while they are not impressed by Mr Johnson\u2019s deal are likely to back it to avoid trouble at any forthcoming general election.\n\nAnd then there are the independents. Mr Johnson kicked out 21 Tories when they backed the Benn Act, which made no-deal illegal and would force the PM to ask the EU for an extension.\n\nMany of those are likely to back a deal but around six are said to be undecided.\n\nSome hardline Tories are unimpressed that Northern Ireland remains tied to the EU so could vote against the deal.\n\nThe ERG consistently voted down Mrs May\u2019s deal but could still be persuaded by Boris in the next few hours.\n\nEarly reports suggest there are 35 who are undecided or have yet to announce either way. Therefore the fate of the nation rests in their hands.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow could end up with a casting vote (Picture: AFP)\n\nWhat about the non-voters?\n\nThere are 11 non-voters.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow and his three deputies (two Labour, one Conservative) do not vote, while the seven Irish republicans of Sinn Fein do not take their seats.\n\nIn the event of a tied vote, convention states that Mr Bercow would make the casting decision.", "description": "Today\u2019s Brexit vote in the House of Commons is \u2018too close to call,\u2019 according to experts.
