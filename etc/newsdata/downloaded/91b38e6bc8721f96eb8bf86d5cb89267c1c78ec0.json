But discussions stumbled over price as well as concerns related to ongoing Sino-Canada political tensions, the people said.\n\nThough talks have stalled, it\u2019s still possible a suitor may re-enter with a better offer, according to one of the people. The Canadian company could also decide to pursue other options, such as selling a stake in its Cote project, the people said.
