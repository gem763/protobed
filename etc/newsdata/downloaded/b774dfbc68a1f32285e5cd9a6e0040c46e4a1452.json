At the same time, the level of unemployment increased by 22,000, to 1.31 million, or 3.9%.\n\nAnalysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain at historic lows, and for there to be an increase in the number of people in employment.\n\n\u201cExternal surveys indicate that economic and political uncertainties are impacting on firms\u2019 hiring intentions,\u201d the ONS said on Tuesday, noting that a British Chambers of Commerce survey found that employers would curtail hiring in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe fall in the number of people at work was driven by an increase in the number of women, young people, and part-time workers who are unemployed, the ONS said.\n\n\u201cThe number of women entering employment has been a strong contributing factor to the current high employment levels, so a fall in their number in employment has had a larger impact on the current level of employment.\u201d", "description": "The number of people at work fell in the three months to the end of August.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cKBbYAPgOAJtQq4MM1gGDw--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c6633690-ef25-11e9-a77f-3cb7817f90dc", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
