TLRY, +17.26% is poised to have its international operations become a key part of its growth story after a series of acquisitions that have created multiple entry points to the U.S. CBD market and as its Portuguese license awaits final GMP certifications, Cowen said Tuesday. Analyst Vivien Azer reiterated his outperform rating on the stock, but slashed his price target to $60 from $150. \"We would argue that TLRY has been the most impacted by weak industry supply as its asset light model was initially overly reliant on third-party supply,\" Azer wrote in a note to clients. \"While the company has indicated that it is seeing pockets of improvement, and recently moved up its supply/demand balancing timeline, it has also proactively addressed its capacity by expanding its current facilities as well as through the Natura Naturals acquisition.\" Shares were up 5.4% Tuesday, but have fallen 62% in 2019, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +2.67% has fallen 3.5% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.69% has gained 16%.", "description": "Canadian cannabis company Tilray Inc. is poised to have its international operations become a key part of its growth story after a series of acquisitions...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}
