And when the staff subsequently presented to their customers with a view, it becomes personal or non-general advice,\" Dr Koh said.\n\n\"When we apply that reasoning in the life insurance sales context at a bank branch, the very nature of a hard sell of life insurance via a personalised organic conversation would make such conversations in a professional setting personal advice.\"\n\nDr Koh said in his experience working for a major life insurer, bank branch sales were considered a key plank of the distribution strategy.\n\nAlthough CBA has flagged its intention to sell CommInsure to Pan-Asian insurer AIA, Dr Koh said he expected branches to continue offering insurance products as part of their service offering in order to receive commissions or incentives, although they would be recommending the products of third parties and not in-house insurers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBank branch staff who are not listed on ASIC's register of financial advisers are not able to legally provide personal advice on life insurance or any other financial products.\n\n'Well beyond super'\n\nHerbert Smith Freehills partner Michael Vrisakis agreed with Dr Koh's assessment of the Federal Court judgment.\n\n\u201cThe commercial significance of this goes well beyond retail superannuation into retail financial products more generally,\" he said.\n\n\u201cPersonal advice can materialise wherever there is an existing relationship with a customer or where engagement with a customer is sufficient to create a belief on the part of the customer that you are acting in their best interests.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Services Council, which represents both life insurers and retail superannuation funds, said it was taking the time to review the judgment and consider the implications for members.\n\nCBA has been approached for comment.", "description": "Life insurance sales could be devastated by the Federal Court\u2019s decision in the corporate regulator\u2019s superannuation dispute with Westpac, says CommInsure\u2019s former chief medical officer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f2710fe78c0426d71aa3dad4761f09ba3880f308", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
