Seven had still not been found.\n\nBaby Zephany was snatched on April 30 of that year. The kidnapper has maintained that Zephany was given to her by a woman, who had been giving her fertility treatment, in an \"adoption\".\n\nHer birthday has been celebrated since that day, on that date, while she lived with the Steenberg woman.\n\nZephany\u2019s true identity was revealed by DNA tests after the Nurse\u2019s daughter Cassidy, who attended school with her, told her parents that the girl bore a striking resemblance to her.\n\nOn March 10, Judge John Hlophe convicted the woman of kidnapping, fraud and contravening the Children's Act.\n\nThe accused\u2019s probation officer, Yumna Rinquest, on Thursday testified that she recommend that it was in the interest of the victims that the accused face direct imprisonment.\n\nAccording to her report, the kidnapper maintained she had no knowledge of the incident, and had not accepted responsibility or shown remorse.\n\nRiaz Khan, for the accused, argued that the report did not include the accused\u2019s personal circumstances, or that she was a first offender.\n\nThe kidnapper\u2019s mother abandoned her when she was 12 and she was left to look after her six siblings.\n\nRinquest said that, according to her consultations with the accused, she had coped well and, while she did struggle, she had \"overcome difficulty\".\n\nThe accused had lost a baby of her own and had suffered miscarriages in the years leading up to Zephany\u2019s kidnapping.\n\n\"The report appears to minimise her trauma, when compared to the interests of complainants,\" Rinquest argued.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the day\u2019s proceedings, Zephany\u2019s biological father Morne Nurse said, according to advocates he had been speaking to, the accused should get \"at least six years for every year she had my daughter\".\n\n\"But the figure in my mind is at least 30 years,\" he said.\n\nClosing arguments were expected to be delivered next Thursday.", "description": "Since the abduction of baby Zephany Nurse 19 years ago, six other babies have been stolen from state hospitals in the province, the Western Cape High Court has heard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://graph.facebook.com/10227041841/picture", "published_at": "2016-08-04"}
