Rather than cracking, the top men\u2014Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka\u2014won every major available. The last 11 majors have been won by Federer, Nadal and Djokovic, an improbable streak. In men\u2019s tennis, this is the first time in history that no current champion is under the age of 30.\n\nIn the U.S. Open final on Sunday, there\u2019s at least a chance that the old-timers\u2019 dominance will end, because Daniil Medvedev is just the type who can battle against Nadal shot-to-shot.\n\nMedvedev, 6-feet-6, has played 22 matches this summer, with just two defeats. One was against Nick Kyrgios; the other was delivered by Nadal, in Montreal.\n\nAt the Western and Southern Open in Mason, Ohio, Medvedev beat Djokovic in the semifinal in three sets, before going on to take the title. So far at the U.S. Open, Medvedev has lost four sets. Though Medvedev could be tired against Nadal, Nadal said this match could be close.\n\n\u201cI need to be playing at my best,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI need to hold this level if I want to have chances on Sunday. If not, is so difficult. He is very, very solid.\u201d\n\nMedvedev should attack Nadal\u2019s serve. Medvedev has an incredible wingspan, and often returns deep. His backhand is unique. Medvedev often sets up on a slight angle, so his opponents can\u2019t tell where the ball will go until it\u2019s too late to respond. He hits his backhand especially flat, another reason why he might make Nadale uncomfortable. He said he has been using this technique since he was young.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, I tried to make my open hands in sync,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cI found that playing flat brings a lot of difficulties to my open hands, and so I started playing flat, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m still playing like this.\u201d\n\nTo win the final, Medvedev likely needs to win the first set. Once Nadal wins the first set in a Slam, he has won 230 of 234 matches, according to Tennis Abstract.\n\nSo far this tournament, Medvedev has played three more hours than Nadal. The reason is worrisome: break points on his serve. Medvedev has faced 53 break points and has lost 18 of them. Nadal has faced just 16 break points and has lost only six. The main concern for Medvedev: Nadal is, by far, the best returner since data about service returns was first collected in 1992. At the U.S. Open, Nadal has won 39% of return points against first serves and 53% against second serves.\n\nIf Nadal wins the final, he will be just one major title behind Federer (19 compared to 20). Nadal likely won\u2019t play much before the Australian Open in January, but if he can remain healthy, he will likely be the favorite for the French Open, which he has won 12 times.\n\nEarlier this year, Nadal struggled with injuries. He looked nothing like himself when the clay season began. But Nadal has been healthy at the French Open, Wimbledon and now at the U.S. Open. Montreal was the only hard-court tournament he played leading up to the U.S. Open. After that, he rested and continued to train. When Nadal is playing and feeling like this, it usually takes an absurd effort to beat him.\n\n\u201cIf a player is playing Rafa and Rafa is two percent less than his normal, that\u2019s an opportunity,\u201d said Todd Martin, who reached the U.S. Open final in 1999. (He lost to Andre Agassi in five sets. \u201cBut Rafa\u2019s two percent drop, it\u2019s just not that significant, so that the other player has to rise 10 percent in order to win.\u201d\n\nDaniil Medvedev hits a shot during the semifinal against Grigor Dimitrov.

His volleys have long been accurate and on his high backhand volley\u2014when he has to bounce up and turn around\u2014he often flicks a remarkable winner. Nadal rarely misses his overhead. And of course, there\u2019s the forehand, one of the best in tennis history. Nadal is at the top of his game right now, as is clear from shots like the sliding winner he hit from outside the net post against Cilic in the fourth round.\n\nEven if Nadal wins on Sunday, there is finally a sense that the most dominant players might be yielding ground to fresh potential stars.\n\n\u201c[I] don\u2019t need to hold this era anymore,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cAt some point, these days, going to happen sooner than later that this era is going to end. I am 33. Novak is 32. Roger is 38. Andy is 32, too. The clock is not stopping. That\u2019s part of the cycle of life.\u201d", "description": "Rafael Nadal is aiming to win his 19th career Grand Slam title, but Daniil Medvedev is fast improving and has the game to pull off the upset.", "authors": ["Tom Perrotta"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105063/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
