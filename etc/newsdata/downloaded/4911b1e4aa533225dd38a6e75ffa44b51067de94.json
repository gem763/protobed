Photo: Jefferson Siegel/NY Daily News via Getty Images\n\nTekashi 6ix9ine and his driver were on their way to a pal\u2019s house when a car hit them from behind.\n\nThe \u201cFEFE\u201d rapper, legally named Daniel Hernandez, stayed in the car while his driver, Jorge Rivera, went to see what was up.\n\n\u201cHe takes longer than usual,\u201d Hernandez said Wednesday in Manhattan federal court. \u201cI see a guy running up to the passenger side with a gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn, they caught me. It\u2019s over,\u201d Hernandez recalled thinking. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hit the lock to the door.\u201d\n\nSo began Hernandez\u2019s detailed description of a July 22, 2018 incident which left him fearing for his life. He provided this account while testifying in the racketeering case against purported Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods members Anthony \u201cHarv\u201d Ellison and Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack.\u201d Tekashi and prosecutors allege that Ellison kidnapped him. Mack allegedly pushed drugs such as heroin and fentanyl.\n\n\u201cHe opens the door and has the gun pointed at me,\u201d Hernandez alleged, identifying the man as \u201cSha.\u201d Ellison also stood there with a gun.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleading with him,\u201d said Hernandez, who started to choke up on the stand. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Bro, I gave you everything. I put money in your pocket.\u201d\n\nHernandez\u2019s pleas fell on deaf ears, he alleged.\n\n\u201cThey told me to get into the car before they shoot me,\u201d Hernandez alleged.\n\nHernandez complied and climbed into the back of their car.\n\nThey drove off. Rivera was following behind them, calling OnStar in a panic.\n\n\u201cI need you to call the police,\u201d Rivera told the operator. \u201cMy brother has been kidnapped!\u201d\n\nEllison and Sha managed to lose Rivera.\n\nAt one point, both men got out of the car.\n\nSha pulled Hernandez out.\n\n\u201cSha had me pinned down by the hair,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cHe just kept hitting me on my face.\u201d\n\nThey told Hernandez to say \u201cnot Billy\u201d \u2014 a way of saying he wasn\u2019t part of Nine Trey.\n\n\u201cI said it three times,\u201d Hernandez claimed.\n\nSha wasn\u2019t satisfied, it seemed.\n\nHe \u201ckept repeating, \u2018We should do this n\u2014a,\u2019\u201d Hernandez said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Ellison allegedly replied. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever gonna know, this is a stolie anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cA stolie?\u201d the prosecutor asked.\n\n\u201cA stolen vehicle,\u201d Hernandez explained.\n\nHarv allegedly asked, \u201c\u2018Yo, what you got?\u201d\n\nHe told Harv that he didn\u2019t have any jewelry on him.\n\n\u201cWe came to an agreement, if I gave [them] jewelry, they would let me go.\u201d\n\nHernandez called up his daughter\u2019s mom, who was at his house, and told her to bring down his jewelry. Sha met her downstairs.\n\nThe loot included a Presidential Rolex, spinning 69 chain, four \u201cfully diamond\u201d rings, cuban bracelet, and a My Little Pony chain. (The mane of this pony was made out of Hernandez\u2019s own rainbow hair.)\n\nAfter the men drove a bit more, they stopped near a housing project which many referred to as \u201cSmurf Village.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet out the car,\u201d Harv allegedly said.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No, because if I get out the car, you\u2019ll shoot me in the back.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter they went back and forth about getting shot, Hernandez darted out.\n\n\u201cI just took my chances and ran.\u201d\n\nHernandez hurried down the street.\n\nHe reached for the handle of a car. The backdoor opened and he got in.\n\n\u201c\u2018What the f\u2013k n\u2014a, get the f\u2013k out of my car,\u2019\u201d Hernandez recalled the driver saying.\n\n\u201cShut up \u2014 I\u2019m about to die!\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Bro, you need to relax, at this point, just drive.\u201d\n\nThen Hernandez noticed: The car right behind them was Ellison\u2019s.\n\n\u201cDo not turn your blinkers on!\u201d Hernandez told the driver. \u201cI told him to drop me off at the precinct.\u201d\n\nHernandez eventually wound up at Kings County Hospital. His former manager, Kifano \u201cShotti\u201d Jordan, got him discharged because there were a \u201cwhole bunch of fans in here.\u201d They instead went to a hospital on Long Island, where Hernandez got a CAT scan and concussion meds, he said.\n\nWhen he returned home later that night, Jordan brought him \u201ca big assault rifle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you recognize this?\u201d the prosecutor asked, showing a large black gun wrapped in plastic.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hernandez said, it\u2019s \u201cthe assault rifle Shotti brought.\u201d\n\nThe gun was taken out of its plastic. The prosecutor stood with the gun in front of the jury box for several moments, allowing jurors to view the weapon.\n\nEllison\u2019s lawyer has contended that the kidnapping is a hoax by Hernandez, to get more attention.\n\nHernandez returns to the stand on Thursday.", "description": "The embattled rapper has spent the week testifying against his former associates in cooperation with the feds.
