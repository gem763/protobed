Ms Orr, who was diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time in 2010, won widespread admiration as a pioneering strong female voice in the national press, combining great intellect with emotional intelligence.\n\nPraised as \u201cThe Independent at its finest\u201d and \u201ca brilliant and original thinker\u201d, the Scottish-born writer had completed her memoir, Motherwell, a book about her early life growing up in Scotland, which is due to be published early next year.\n\nFormer colleagues said the world was now a smaller place.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Christian Broughton, the editor, said she represented so much about The Independent.\n\n\u201cShe combined great intellect with emotional intelligence, she was often edgy and always full of integrity, writing columns that brought tough and often controversial subjects within reach,\u201d he said. \u201cDeborah was never afraid to present an independently minded opinion.\u201d\n\nSimon O\u2019Hagan, who worked at The Independent for 25 years, praised her as \u201ca brilliant and original thinker whose take on the world, even if you disagreed with it, couldn\u2019t fail to command respect\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a person she had enormous integrity. She was funny and irreverent. She treated everyone equally and was altogether fantastic company,\u201d he said.\n\nMs Orr, who was born in Motherwell, near Glasgow, joined the Guardian in 1990, where she worked as a features sub-editor with Linda Taylor, now The Independent\u2019s head of production. \u201cDeborah and I worked together at the Guardian in 1990. Back then she was tough and opinionated \u2013 and I\u2019m glad to say that nothing changed over the next 30 years,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAfter becoming the first female editor of the Guardian\u2019s Weekend magazine, Ms Orr later came to The Independent, where she fearlessly highlighted issues ranging from economic injustices and social problems to the Madeleine McCann case, which she described as \u201ca monument to the grotesque and frightening dangers of gossip\u201d.\n\nIn 1997, she married Will Self, the novelist and journalist. The couple separated two years ago, after a 20-year marriage. She is survived by her sons, Ivan and Luther, and her stepchildren, Alexis and Madeleine. She returned to the Guardian as a columnist for almost a decade, then just last year joined the i newspaper.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, she wrote openly about her treatment. Ironically, she had written about cancer several times, including five years earlier, this for The Independent on how people with cancer are not always \u201cbrave\u201d but have no choice in the matter. The disease returned this summer.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Alex Andreou, a lawyer-turned-actor, described her as \u201cone of the best friends anyone could wish for, one of the cleverest human beings, the best damn gallery tour guide, and [with] a sense of humour so dry it was almost desiccated\u201d.\n\nRoger Alton, who edited The Independent from 2008 to 2010, said the world was very much a smaller place now, remembering a \u201dwarm, funny and fearless\u201d writer.\n\nMs Orr was full of ideas and \u201cincredibly clever \u2013 beyond words really\u201d, he said. \u201dCharming, too, when she wanted to be, which was often. She could be difficult but I don\u2019t know anyone who didn\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\nHe recalled her smoking \u201con an Olympic scale\u201d and her profanity but that her \u201cunderstanding of what mattered in culture, arts, books, film, theatre etc was flawless\u201d.\n\nShe was full of ideas, wrote like a dream and was a brilliant, innovative editor Roger Alton\n\n\u201cShe wrote like a dream,\u201d he said. \u201cShe loved her garden too and only a few weeks ago I was lugging bags of earth around the place to help tidy it up. She was directing me and wanted to help but it was clear that she shouldn\u2019t because she was weakening.\n\n\u201cA brilliant and innovative editor of the Guardian magazine, she was none the less not that well treated by that paper once Peter Preston, who understood her talent and developed it, had left. Funny, sought-after and admired, with a great capacity to make friends too. All of whom loved her.\n\n\u201cShe endured everything with great courage.\u201d\n\nRachel Johnson, the journalist and Boris Johnson\u2019s sister, tweeted that Ms Orr was \u201cthe warrior queen of journalism\u201d.\n\nMariella Frostrup, the presenter of Open Book on Radio 4, said her autobiography was \u201ca must-read\u201d. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, the publisher of her memoir, said in a statement: \u201cThe loss of Deborah Orr, who was exceptional in so many ways, cannot be understated. She was adored by everyone who worked with her.\u201d\n\nTaylor added: \u201cWhen we worked together on features, it was very obvious she would go places. In a typically macho world she fought for the voice of young female working-class women. I think she frightened some people. But she would kick up, never down \u2013 she was a people\u2019s champion. She wouldn\u2019t take any nonsense from management.\u201d\n\nLast month, she tweeted that it had been a year since she first went to her GP with chest and back pain, and that she had only just seen a breast oncologist for the first time.\n\n\u201cDeborah was one of the first really strong female voices in Fleet Street, Taylor said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s really sad to lose such an incredible woman.\u201d\n\nMr O\u2019Hagan tweeted that commissioning her to write for Radio Times was \u201ca highlight of my time at the magazine\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cDeborah Orr was The Independent at its finest.\u201d", "description": "Tributes have poured in for Deborah Orr, the former Independent writer known for her outspoken championing of social issues, who has died at the age of 57.\u00a0Ms Orr, who was diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time in 2010, won widespread admiration as a pioneering strong female voice in the national press, combining great intellect with emotional intelligence.", "authors": ["Jane Dalton"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/17/deborah-orr-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
