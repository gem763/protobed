Look down!\"\n\nThe pilot banks the helicopter round 180 degrees and swoops down to hover 30 metres (100 feet) above the scarred earth.\n\nPeople are looking anxiously skywards, scuttling about. Others are throwing machinery and pumping equipment into pools of muddy water.\n\nThese are the garimpeiros, the illegal miners, here from Brazil in their thousands in search of a fortune.\n\nTrees are uprooted and sites left abandoned when the miners move on. Laurent Kelle, World Wildlife Fund French Guiana\n\nIllegal miners: Why they come\n\nThe Guiana tectonic plate stretches from Brazil through French Guiana and into Suriname. It is rich in minerals, especially gold. And it has been a pull for small-time prospectors since the 1850s.\n\nBut the rise in the price of gold in recent years has seen a mini gold rush. There are now around 400 illegal mine sites in French Guiana, employing around 7,000 people.\n\nAnd that is a problem for such a pristine environment.\n\nLaetitia Brechet of Antwerp University is researching the effects of climate change on soils [Tristan Redman/Al Jazeera]\n\n\"Trees are uprooted and sites left abandoned when the miners move on. The process involves mercury, which leaches into the soil and waterways, polluting the rivers and indeed the biosphere as a whole,\" said Laurent Kelle from WWF.\n\nAround 10 tonnes of gold is extracted annually - worth an astonishing half a billion dollars. You can see the appeal.\n\nGeopolitics: Protecting the l ittle European corner of the Amazon\n\nAlso attractive is the fact that as a territory of France, the rule of law in French Guiana offers more protection than in Brazil, where often the authorities will shoot first and ask questions afterwards.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron recently declared that France is an Amazon country and clearly has skin in the game.\n\nThat was a barb aimed at Brazilian President Jair Bolsanaro's bullish position on Amazonia, as fires rage in the majority Brazilian part and the bulldozers raze large sections of forest for farming.\n\nBut it also means France must be seen to protect this little European corner of the Amazon.\n\n\"We have 600 soldiers, paramilitary police and other services, engaged daily in the fight against illegal gold mining,\" Marc del Grande, the new head of regional government in French Guiana, told us.\n\nMining for gold in French Guiana often happens under the rainforest canopy [Al Jazeera]\n\n\"Two-hundred of these are mostly soldiers but police, forestry and customs agents also sleep nightly in the forest. They lead patrols and small units of around 15 men.\"\n\nSatellite images are closely monitored and any changes in the forest canopy are passed on to the National Forestry Office which sends out helicopter teams to investigate.\n\nHelicopters are an indispensable tool for authorities searching for illegal gold mining operations [Tristan Redman/Al Jazeera]\n\nWhen arrests are made, equipment is destroyed and the culprits deported or charged.\n\nThe authorities here say their policy has achieved containment but acknowledge more needs to be done. At 1,000 kilometres (620 miles), the border with Brazil is the longest in France, the equivalent of the distance from London to Marseille.\n\nPatrolling river and rainforest over that area is impossible. The garimpeiros know the multitude of waterways well and blocking all routes in and out is just not feasible.\n\nAlternatives\n\nRapid bounty was the driving force that brought the French here back in the 18th century. And rapid bounty is again the lure in 21st. The difference is, it is now France that is trying to protect what it regards as its own patch of Amazon.\n\nAnd to do that efficiently it is evident the rainforest must be tapped in other ways.\n\nWe flew over small, officially-sanctioned gold mines where companies must adhere to stringent regulations. That includes replacing forest destroyed once the mining operation is complete.\n\nAl Jazeera's Nick Clark at Nouragues research station in French Guiana [Tristan Redman/Al Jazeera]\n\nBut whether or not that works on an industrial level is something environmentalists would like never to see tested.\n\nEcotourism has enormous potential. So too building on the territory's reputation as a centre of scientific research.\n\nThere is a rich seam of knowledge to be acquired in the fight against climate change here.\n\nFrench Guiana's rainforest remains an invaluable resource; a rare, mostly intact part of Amazonia.
