As far as the Kremlin is concerned, Trump functions, in Putin\u2019s eyes, as a buffer between Russia and the traditional U.S. national security establishment, which the Kremlin sees as implacably hostile. Trump has thrown overboard all of the established U.S. foreign policy approaches to Russia. He doesn\u2019t preach and he doesn\u2019t stand in Russia\u2019s way. Trump is a businessman, not an ideological warrior, and he is not impeded by annoying democratic values.\n\nRussia is ready to pay a price to maintain the Trump buffer, including enduring further rounds of Western economic sanctions. The rest of the U.S. political class, both Democratic and Republican, represents a long-term strategic threat to Russia and its geopolitical interests. Thus, regardless of whatever headaches Trump may create for the Kremlin, he will always seem like the lesser evil. Not surprisingly, whatever happens to Trump, Putin publicly supports him. But now, there is more scrutiny than ever on Trump\u2019s foreign policy conduct, and he will likely not be able to operate in secret.\n\nThe third and final reason for the Kremlin to be worried comes from the growing fear that a private presidential conversation with Trump could be published without Russia\u2019s permission.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tatiana Stanovaya", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
