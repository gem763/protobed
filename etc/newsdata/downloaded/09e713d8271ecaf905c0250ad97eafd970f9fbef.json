Two minutes of prayer, visualisation, meditation for those in the way of the storm.\u201d\n\nMs Williamson\u2019s campaign later explained that the tweet was not intended to be taken literally.\n\n\u201cIt was a metaphor,\u201d her spokeswoman Patricia Ewing said. \u201cWhen others speak of prayer and the mind it\u2019s considered profound, but Williamson is held to a different standard. Because the comment led to confusion it was replaced.\n\n\u201cEveryone please pray for the people of the Bahamas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. May the peace of God be upon them, may they and their families remain safe and their hearts be comforted as they endure the storm.\u201d\n\nMs Williamson herself tweeted a response to Yashar Ali, a journalist who had earlier posted an image of the deleted tweet along with the message: \u201cMarianne Williamson has deleted this tweet\u201d.\n\nMs Williamson replied: \u201cSince you obviously want to debunk, counter or mischaracterise anything I do, would you like to have an honest and fair public dialogue? Since I\u2019m neither crazy, irresponsible nor dangerous, I would appreciate the opportunity to counter the caricature.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
