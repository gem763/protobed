Josmar Taveras, USA TODAY\n\nIn a move that conveniently edges Amazon further into the health care space, the e-commerce giant just announced that it's partnering with the nutrition brand GNC, pharmacy network Health Mart and retailer Stage Stores to give you greater control over how you retrieve your packages.\n\nJust months after Amazon introduced in-store pickup options to Rite Aids in the U.S., the online retailer said on Wednesday it is significantly expanding its reach into more than 1,000 new stores by 2020.\n\nShoppers can currently pick up their packages at 100 Right Aid stores, but by the end of the year, that number will swell to 1,500 GNC, Health Mart and Stage Stores stores \"from Oyster Bay, N.Y., to Chula Vista, Calif,\" Amazon said.\n\nKnock off cars: Are those fake Lamborghinis and Bugattis sold online just about fun? Or is it fraud?\n\nGita is a new cargo robot that can follow you:It can carry your stuff for about 4 hours\n\nThe pickup service is called Amazon Counter and it lets you ship your packages to the nearest partnering store if you fear your neighbor, or strangers, will steal your packaged delivery before you can make it home from work.\n\nMany product searches now start on Amazon, not Google. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nAmazon said it leveraged its \"growing logistics network and invested in new, easy to use technology to give customers yet another delivery option rooted in flexibility and control.\"\n\nHow Counter works\n\nWhen you try to make a purchase online or using the Amazon app, you'll see an option to ship to one of the Counter pickup points in your ZIP code.\n\n(Photo: Amazon)\n\nOnce your package arrives at a partnering location, you'll get an email and unique barcode to retrieve your goods during store hours.\n\nThe option is just one of Amazon's Hub services which include Lockers, a self-service kiosk that lets you pick up your package at a time that's convenient for you. Amazon also offers Key, an in-home delivery service where drivers can drop packages inside your home near the front door.\n\nAmazon has launched a telemedicine smartphone app for some Seattle-based employees.

Amazon has dropped hints about moving into healthcare for years.\n\nIn 2018, Amazon launched a company to reduce health care costs for employees along with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. That same year, Amazon acquired PillPack, an online pharmacy the lets users buy medications in prepackaged doses.\n\nLast month, the online retailer launched Amazon Care, a virtual health clinic for Amazon employees in Seattle.\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/23/amazons-pickup-service-counter-expands-more-stores/4069142002/", "description": "Months after Amazon introduced in-store pickup options, the online retailer\u00a0said on Wednesday\u00a0it is significantly expanding its reach.", "authors": ["Dalvin Brown", "Published A.M.
