We\u2019re just going to try to go out there and just have some fun.\u201d\n\nThe Astros worked all season to claim the best record in baseball but have little to show for their home-field advantage for Wednesday\u2019s game seven championship decider.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like there is one right now, but I hope there\u2019s one tomorrow,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting until the last game to have it on our side. We worked really hard to get home-field and we\u2019re happy to play at home. We have no problem playing at home. This place will be rocking.\u201d\n\n\u2013 A \u2018weird\u2019 series \u2013\n\nThe Astros have dropped three in a row to the Nationals in Houston. They haven\u2019t lost four in a row at home all season.\n\n\u201cThis series has been very weird,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cIf I had told you the series was going to be 3-3 going to a game seven, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person in the building that would have assumed that all road teams were going to win.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure that last one is not the same.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, it\u2019s the road teams who have an edge in MLB one-game deciders.\n\nVisiting teams are 60-57 in MLB winner-take-all playoff games, including a 20-19 mark in the World Series.\n\nRoad teams have won three straight World Series game sevens, most recently when the Astros beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2017 for their first World Series title.\n\nThe Nationals are chasing the first title in the 50-year history of the franchise, which began as the Montreal Expos before moving to the US capital in 2005.\n\nWashington has not had a World Series champion since 1924 when the Senators beat the New York Giants in game seven in 12 innings. Washington twice saw teams move away and went 33 years without a club until the Expos arrived.\n\nThree-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer, who missed a planned game five start with neck spasms, will pitch for Washington against fellow right-hander Zack Greinke for Houston in the decider.\n\nScherzer was benched hours before his start, given a cortizone injection and was able to work out in the bullpen during game six before Nats manager Dave Martinez shut him down after Rendon\u2019s two-run homer produced a 5-2 cushion.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d probably make a movie about it,\u201d Eaton said of Scherzer\u2019s fightback to pitch Wednesday. \u201cHe could come back from the dead.\u201d\n\nOr it could be \u201cMad Max: The Road Warrior.\u201d", "description": "Houston (AFP) \u2013 In a World Series where road teams have won every game, Houston native Anthony Rendon has sparked the Washington Nationals into a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/1e4535_washington-anthony-rendon-houston-native-drove-in-runs-tuesday-power-nationals-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
