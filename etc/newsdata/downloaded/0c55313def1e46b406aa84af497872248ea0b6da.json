USA TODAY Sports\n\nAllowing 10 runs in the first inning is a fantastic recipe for losing a winner-take-all playoff game.\n\nBut Georgia House majority whip Trey Kelley (R) took to Twitter to pin another reason behind the Atlanta Braves' misfortunes in Wednesday's 13-1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the NLDS: The absence of foam tomahawks in the stands.\n\n\"This. Is. Painful,\" Kelley tweeted. \"Have to feel this is karma for the unjustified and rash decision to do away with foam tomahawks.\"\n\nThe Braves' decision came days after St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Ryan Helsley, a member of the Cherokee Nation, said he found the \"Tomahawk Chop\" offensive. \"It\u2019s about the misconception of us, the Native Americans, and it devalues us and how we\u2019re perceived in that way, or used as mascots,\" Helsley said.\n\nThe Tomahawk Chop has been a tradition at Braves games for more than two decades.\n\nKelley wasn't the lone prominent Georgia Republican to weigh in about the move.\n\nThis. Is. Painful. Have to feel this is karma for the unjustified and rash decision to do away with foam tomahawks. \u2014 Trey Kelley (@RepTreyKelley) October 9, 2019\n\nNick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's former chief of staff and a prominent figure in Georgia politics, had a similar reaction.\n\n\"Maybe don't ban the tomahawk chop next time?\" he tweeted.\n\nOthers tweeting their displeasure included Tea PartyMovement co-founder Debbie Dooley, who suggested the Braves change their name to the \"Atlanta Snowflakes,\" and Austin Chambers, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee.\n\nFans at the game still did the tomahawk chop, except with their arms instead of the props.", "description": "Some Georgia Republicans were not thrilled the Atlanta Braves did not distribute foam tomahawks to fans for Game 5 of the NLDS against the Cardinals.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published P.M.
