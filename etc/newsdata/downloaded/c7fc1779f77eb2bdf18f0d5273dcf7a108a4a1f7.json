The way she sees it, hateful speech and actions online can be similarly deadly. The social activist knows the toll it can take from personal experience.\n\nIn the 1990s, after details of her affair with the president at the time, Bill Clinton, leaked, she went from a private citizen to the tabloids\u2019 favourite headline fodder. When the story broke online in January 1998, as she put it in her 2015 TED Talk, she was swept up into \u201cscandal brought to you by the digital revolution.\u201d She called herself \u201cpatient zero\u201d for losing your reputation in the age of the internet.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of her story. Today, she\u2019s made a name for herself as an activist. And for October\u2019s Anti-Bullying Month, she\u2019s releasing her latest anti-bullying campaign: \u201cThe Epidemic.\u201d It tells the story of an \u201caverage American teenager,\u201d Hailey, as she navigates high school. However, there\u2019s more to her story than you can see at first glance.\n\nIn light of the new campaign, we asked Lewinsky to weigh in on cyberbullying, Gen Z\u2019s approach to social media, and the internet era of Caroline Calloway.\n\nHow is cyberbullying like a disease? If it\u2019s the sickness, what\u2019s the treatment and the cure?\n\nLike a disease, it\u2019s contagious and spreading \u2014 infecting our society. The cure is not engaging and clicking with compassion.\n\nThis campaign video is so intense. How do you hope this heavy approach will re-contextualise the issue of cyberbullying for viewers?\n\nThis PSA is hard to see. The signs of cyberbullying can also be hard to see \u2014we have instant recognition for physical pain, but less so with emotional pain. It can be hard to really understand the pain caused by online harassment. This is especially true for young people who haven\u2019t lived long enough to really grasp the full extent of consequences that can come from this behaviour \u2014 consequences ranging from bad to grave. This PSA educates people through an emotional and devastating experience, in hopes that they\u2019ll better understand the consequences.\n\nLastly, when you\u2019re the target, it can be hard to see that you can survive this.\n\nIn the last few decades, there\u2019s been this permanent element to digital harassment. The things you say stay online forever. However, I think it\u2019s noteworthy that Gen Z is using platforms where messages and conversations disappear. It\u2019s like this new generation doesn\u2019t want to leave a trace. How does that impact cyberbullying?\n\nI think Gen Z, having been raised with social media, has found work-arounds for some of the failures reflecting the permanence of online trails. But it\u2019s not without its problems. First, I worry that a perceived level of privacy with quickly disappearing images and text actually leave some more vulnerable to later exposure \u2014 it weakens the notion of thinking before you post. And in terms of cyberbullying, it makes it worse. It\u2019s easier to think you can get away with it and harder to capture evidence.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about how you went from a private citizen to a public figure somewhat overnight. How can that take a toll psychologically? How has becoming an instant celebrity changed, with folks like Caroline Calloway and Lauren Duca leaning into it, and then receiving backlash?\n\nI can mainly speak to my experience, but the amount of attention, scrutiny, and thoughts sent your way are jarring on perceptible and imperceptible levels. It affects you both psychologically and energetically.\n\nMost often people who become known have sought lives where they\u2019re recognisable. Caroline Calloway became more well-known because of some controversy, but she was already known publicly\u2026 and choosing that. Lauren Duca chose a modern approach to criticism by owning instead of retreating. In fact, from what I know of Lauren\u2019s story \u2014 which is not everything \u2014 her choices reflected a little of what we did in last year\u2019s campaign, #DefyTheName, with name-calling.\n\nI was definitely not bold like that as a sudden public person. In part, that may have been because I was also in legal jeopardy.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Trigger Warning: Monica Lewinsky\u2019s new PSA campaign video on cyberbullying includes content, prompts, and imagery that some may find upsetting.
