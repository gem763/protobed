You can see in the photograph that some students were not wearing it.\n\n\"Some who wore it removed it after 15 minutes, some after 20 minutes and we ourselves asked them to remove it after one hour.\"\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nSC Peerjade, deputy director of the local pre-University Education Board, told the Times of India the practice was \"inhumane\".\n\nAn official from the Haveri district told Indian news agency IANS: \"A notice has been issued to Bhagat Pre-University College seeking explanation for forcing its students wear cardboard boxes while writing exams to prevent them from copying.\n\n\"Whatever be the purpose, [the students] cannot be made to wear cartons for writing exams.\n\n\"There is no rule or advice from us.\"", "description": "Bhagat Pre-University College, in Haveri, India, has since done a U-turn following public backlash", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659892.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_A-school-in-India-sought-to-clamp-down-on-cheating-by-asking-students-to-wear-boxes-on-their-heads-d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
