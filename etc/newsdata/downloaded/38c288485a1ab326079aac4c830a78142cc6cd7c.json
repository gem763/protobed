The revelation came months after concerns raised by female employees about a toxic workplace led Parker to acknowledge \u201cbehavioral issues\u201d among some company executives, several of whom departed their posts.\n\nThe Nike executive also drew scrutiny over the summer after several Nike-sponsored female athletes said they faced financial penalties if they missed performance goals due to pregnancy. The company subsequently changed its policy.\n\nAt present, it\u2019s unclear of Parker\u2019s conduct in relation to the investigation into Salazar and Brown will impact his standing at Nike, where he has served as CEO since 2006 and overseen steady financial growth. Nike announced last year that Parker would remain as its chairman, president and CEO \u201cbeyond 2020.\u201d\n\nNike shares fell nearly two percent in trading Tuesday, but were up more than 25 percent so far this year. The company topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations in its most recent quarterly earnings report and reported revenue of more than $39 billion in fiscal 2019.\n\nStocks in this Article NKE NIKE INC. $92.28 -1.64 (-1.75%)\n\nThe USADA declined comment on its findings regarding Parker\u2019s knowledge of the situation.\n\nIn a ruling by the American Arbitration Association after the USADA investigation, Salazar and Brown each received four-year bans for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d while working on behalf of the Nike Oregon Project, an elite training program for company-sponsored athletes.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that several emails referenced in the USADA\u2019s reports on the case showed that Parker was kept informed about developments related to their work, including an experiment at a Nike laboratory to determine the amount of testosterone cream \u2013 a banned substance \u2013 that would cause a positive test for an athlete. At one point, Parker reportedly told Brown it would be \u201cinteresting to determine the minimal amount of topical male hormone required to create a positive test.\u201d\n\nSalazar has denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal the decision. Brown has yet to publicly comment.\n\n\u201cAt the time Alberto was concerned that Nike runners could be sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone cream on them,\u201d a Nike spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cMark was shocked that this could be the case and given Mark\u2019s passion for running, Dr. Brown and Alberto made Mark aware of their findings. Mark Parker had no reason to believe that the test was outside any rules as a medical doctor was involved. Furthermore, Mark\u2019s understanding was that Alberto was attempting to prevent doping of his athletes.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Nike announced last year that Parker would remain as its chairman, president and CEO \u201cbeyond 2020.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Mark-Parker.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
