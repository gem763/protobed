I keep telling her she did the right thing and she must never doubt herself.\"\n\nPoppy-Leigh was with her mum Sarah-Jane, dad Jake and one-year-old brother David-James, on Sunday at around 3pm and at first they thought she had wandered off.\n\nThe family were browsing the stalls and in the time it took Sarah-Jane to turn to her husband and point out an item she liked, Poppy-Leigh was gone.\n\nShe had been holding the handle of her brother\u2019s pram while standing beside her mum when she was approached from behind.\n\nThe youngster told her mum she had been hit in the back, which made her let go of the handle of the pram.\n\nShe said a man then told her to take his hand and when she refused, he grabbed her hand and walked off with her.\n\nSarah-Jane explained: \u201cPoppy-Leigh is a confident little girl and we\u2019ve always encouraged her to just be herself and there are times she\u2019ll pull away to walk beside us but I knew there was something wrong because she\u2019s never wandered off anywhere before.\n\n\u201cJake and I separated and stall holders went in various directions.\n\n\u201cI was shouting her name and then another family saw my distress and started shouting her name too.\n\n\"One woman said she\u2019d seen her but she was with her dad and crying hard. I told her the man wasn\u2019t her dad and the lady\u2019s face just dropped.\n\n\"Another man had also seen her, a preacher with religious leaflets but he thought she was with her daddy too and she wasn\u2019t. Her daddy was frantically looking for her and she had been snatched.\n\n\u201cI ran past the bollards to the car park and from the corner of my eye I saw a flash of her white coat and then it vanished, I was shouting her name shouting to her that it was me, it was her mummy.\n\n\u201cThen I saw the coat again and the wee face all crumpled. When I got to her she was crying so hard and she said: \u2018The wrong man took me Mummy\u2019.\n\n\u201cShe was sheet white and I was so relieved to get her in my arms but then when she told me what had actually had happened, I got sick.\n\n\u201cShe hadn\u2019t walked off, she\u2019d been taken and she screamed and shouted at the man and struggled until she managed to get away from him and she hid in the car park.\n\n\u201cPoppy-Leigh has been learning about stranger danger for the last six months, and she instinctively knew there was something bad going on and she needed to get away to safety.\n\n\u201cHer hand was marked and red by the time I found her and it\u2019s still sore today.\n\n\"The man who took her held her hand with great authority.\n\n\"Today she\u2019s told me he hurt her hand when she got out of a van so now we know that she\u2019d actually been inside a van and that\u2019s how close she was to being taken.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve no idea where he went. When the stall holders started to help us look for her they just assumed she was lost, not that she had been abducted and a tanoy announcement was made describing her and her coat.\n\n\u201cEveryone was so helpful at Nutt's Corner Market and the manager stayed with us until we got to speak to the police who've taken the situation very seriously.\"\n\nShe continued: \u201cI would just ask that people use reins for their toddlers to stop this sort of thing being so easy for bad people.\n\n\u201cWe are completely traumatised and devastated and Poppy-Leigh is very upset and unsure of herself today, quiet and withdrawn.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d ask everyone to check their phones, scan their memories and try to recall the man who took my daughter on Sunday at Nutt's Corner market while she was wearing a white spotted coat and her Minnie Mouse glasses. And if they remember anything, even the slightest thing please call the police.\u201d\n\nThe PSNI are appealing for information about the incident and a spokesperson said: \u201cShortly after 3.00pm police received a report that a three year-old girl had disappeared whilst at a stall with her mother. The child was located a short time later near a car park in the area.\n\n\u201cAt this stage it is believed that a male has taken the child\u2019s hand and led her away from the area.\n\n\u201cThankfully the young girl was not harmed in any way, although she is extremely traumatised by her ordeal.\u201d\n\nPSNI Inspector Lindsay McCrea added: \u201cI would appeal to anyone who was at the market in Nutts Corner yesterday and who may have witnessed a male acting suspiciously in and around the stalls to contact police at Antrim on the non-emergency number 101, quoting reference 1130 06/10/19.\n\n\"Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, which is 100% anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.\u201d", "description": "Poppy-Leigh Gilmore, three, was at Nutt's Corner Market in Co Antrim with her family when she was hit and led away by a man who also put her in a van", "authors": ["Jilly Beattie", "Amber Hicks"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20534761.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/71544563_674086063079050_3515727806073929728_n.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
