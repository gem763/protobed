Since the implementation of the administration\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy, which resulted in the traumatic separation of thousands of migrant children from their families, the department has spent $79,359,212.32.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cost-per-night estimate, the Trump administration\u2019s furniture expenditure for the department would have been enough to run the agency\u2019s family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, at full capacity for nearly half a year. It\u2019s also almost enough to repay FEMA for $155 million in federal disaster aid that was diverted to ICE last month. (Just in time for hurricane season.)\n\nThe office furniture expenditures, sorted by code in the Federal Procurement Data System Product and Service Codes Manual, include filing cabinets, dry-erase boards, desks, and many, many chairs\u2014and does not include cots, bed frames, or mattresses destined for use by undocumented immigrants in detention centers.\n\nMuch of the new furniture is earmarked for the department\u2019s new Washington, D.C. headquarters, dubbed \u201cthe most ambitious federal building project since the Pentagon.\u201d The project, a 4.5 million-square-foot office complex due to be completed in 2026, is the largest construction job in the history of the General Services Administration.\n\nA review of purchase descriptions reveal that a surprisingly large percentage of the department\u2019s furniture outlays rest\u2014recline?\u2014on an expensive taste in office chairs. Herman Miller, the luxury furniture maker whose Aeron chair is featured in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s permanent collection, is the most frequent recipient of DHS orders for office furniture.\n\nIn July, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) placed an order to the company for $515,976.09 for office furniture intended for its service center in Laguna Niguel, California. In May, the agency spent $786,409.61 on Herman Miller furniture for an application support center in nearby Tustin, California. One month before that, USCIS spent $803,095.54 for furniture, also from Herman Miller, for an office in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nDHS did not return a request for comment on its budgetary priorities, or whether its furniture budget might be a better target for redirecting funds than disaster relief.\n\nMeanwhile, immigrants in detention centers have been on the receiving end of miserable conditions caused, in part, by underfunding and overcrowding. In February, for example, more than 2,000 Central American migrants were held in an abandoned body-bag factory in Piedras Negras, Mexico, complaining of being \u201cprisoners\u201d in a facility where nighttime temperatures dropped below freezing and where there weren\u2019t enough clothes or cots to go around.\n\nPresident Trump, meanwhile, has shown little compunction for repurposing federal taxpayer dollars earmarked for public safety, education, and the military to be used for his immigration agenda. On Tuesday, The Daily Beast reported that the Trump administration plans to pay for his long-promised border wall with funds redirected from the construction of elementary schools, hazardous waste warehouse facilities, and fire stations.", "description": "Herman Miller, the luxury furniture maker whose Aeron chair is in the Museum of Modern Art, is the most frequent recipient of DHS money for office furniture.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567733118/190905-Bixby-DHS-tease_rncl4s", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
