People remained close to home, and an earlier call for mass gatherings evaporated after it became apparent that moving about the city would be difficult.\n\nBut the unexpected tranquillity masked a palpable sense of dread following the decision on Friday by Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, to invoke colonial-era emergency powers to bar protesters from concealing their identities with masks.\n\nMany people derided the measure as misguided and said it would be ineffective, but they also viewed it as another step in the erosion of the civil liberties that have differentiated this semiautonomous territory from the rest of China.", "description": "After a night of arson and vandalism, the financial hub was bracing for further protests over the weekend.", "authors": ["Andrew Jacobs", "Mike Ives", "Tiffany May"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/05/world/05hongkong-1sub/05hongkong-1sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
