Rooney, Who Is Openly Weighing Impeachment, Won't Seek a New Term", "language": "en", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Florida Rep. Francis Rooney, one of the few Republicans openly weighing whether to impeach President Donald Trump, said Saturday he will not run for reelection.\n\nAsked if he needed or hoped for a third term in 2020, he told Fox News, \u201cI don\u2019t really think I do and I don\u2019t think I really want one.\u201d He said his name could be included in the already-extensive list of GOP retirements.\n\nCiting his priorities of securing money for the Everglades and enacting an offshore drilling ban, he said, \u201cI thought it might take three terms \u2026 but I think I\u2019ve done it in less than two. \u2026 I\u2019ve done what I came to do and I want to be a model for term limits,\u201d adding that this is \u201cpublic service, not public life.\u201d\n\nHe said Friday he was \u201cstill thinking about\u201d whether to vote to impeach Trump, saying Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had acknowledged a quid pro quo was at work when Trump held up U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s investigation of Democrats and the 2016 elections. Mulvaney later claimed his comments had been misconstrued, but Rooney said he and other Republicans heard them clearly.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He also said he was \u201cstill thinking about\u201d whether he believed Trump\u2019s conduct was impeachable.\n\nAnything short of a \u201cno\u201d on that question, even from only one of 197 Republicans in the House, is notable amid the drive by majority Democrats to impeach Trump.\n\nTrump has made clear that he does more than notice what he considers acts of disloyalty. He is fond of making examples of Republicans by threatening to sink their reelection bids and following through in a few cases.\n\nOn Friday night, Trump tweeted, \u201cREPUBLICANS MUST STICK TOGETHER AND FIGHT!\u201d That tweet was accompanied by a video targeting Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who has been critical of Trump\u2019s handling of Turkey\u2019s assault on Syrian Kurds.\n\nWhen Rep. Justin Amash of politically critical Michigan became the first House Republican to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment earlier this year \u2014 and quit the party \u2014 the backlash from Trump\u2019s orbit was swift.\n\nThat was before revelations about Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine, which made his impeachment by the end of the year a real possibility.\n\nA year ago, at a presidential rally in Estero, Trump praised Rooney as \u201ca man who\u2019s so great to me on television. This guy is special. He was a great businessman. Now he\u2019s a great congressman, Francis Rooney.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cI love him when he defends me. He\u2019s brutal. He gets the job done, right, Francis? Thank you, man.\u201d\n\nRooney, 65, serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and is a solid member of the Republican establishment. Among the wealthiest members of the House, he won his second term last year with 62 percent of the vote. His foreign policy bona fides come in part from his service as ambassador to the Holy See under President George W. Bush.\n\nRooney has at times been a Trump critic. He was one of 13 House Republicans to join a Democratic effort early this year to stop the president from declaring a national emergency to fund his border wall with Mexico.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Zeke Miller and news researcher Monika Mathur contributed to this report.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Florida Rep.
