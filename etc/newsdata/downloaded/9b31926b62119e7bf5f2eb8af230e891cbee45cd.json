De Gea strained a muscle adductor on international duty with Spain and is also unlikely to be available. However, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are all in line to return to the starting eleven.\n\nThere is an outside chance Alisson may return in goal for Liverpool having stepped up his rehabilitation over the international break. Salah remains a minor doubt but is expected to make the starting line-up. Xherdan Shaqiri is a doubt with a calf injury while Nathaniel Clyne remains a long-term absentee.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nLiverpool XI: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Milner; Salah, Firmino, Mane.\n\nManchester United XI: Romero; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Lindelof, Shaw; McTominay, Matic, Pereira; James, Mata, Rashford.\n\nOdds\n\nManchester United 4/1\n\nDraw 3/1\n\nLiverpool 4/6", "description": "Manchester United host Liverpool\u00a0at Old Trafford as Jurgen Klopp\u2018s side look to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League table.
