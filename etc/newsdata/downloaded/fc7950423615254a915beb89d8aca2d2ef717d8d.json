I was angry at the disrespect but I didn\u2019t even think about reporting it.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind the era, it would have been \u2018the woman can\u2019t take a joke\u2019, and he would have got, at most, a slap on the wrist.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s when she became the BBC\u2019s first permanent female national newsreader, chiefs were failing to react to serious sexual harassment allegations.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wouldn\u2019t get any support from management,\u201d says Angela, who turned 75 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cSo those of us who were aware of the sex pests protected the women in our departments.\n\n\"I remember one particular famous person. I won\u2019t name him now \u2013 though maybe I will one day because it will be quite a shock to people.\u201d\n\n(Image: Press Association)\n\nShe adds: \u201cPeople would say \u2018You know, X is a terrible sex pest, but management have said he is a star \u2013 deal with it\u2019. So we dealt with it... by not letting our young women go anywhere near him.\u201d\n\nAngela hopes things have changed for those who have followed in her wake with the #MeToo movement.\n\nBusier than ever, presenting Rip Off Britain and asking the questions on new quiz show The Wall \u2013 she is proof silver-haired women are still TV gold.\n\nShe laughs: \u201cWhen I was 50, John Birt [former BBC Director-General] said to me \u2018Angela, you have had your day. It\u2019s time to make way for the younger women coming behind you\u2019.\n\n\u201cI thought \u2018Are you saying this to the likes of Michael Parkinson and the other men older than me?\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt was such a stupid thing to say. So, I do take a smidgen of pride in being \u2018a trailblazer\u2019 \u2013 like Gloria Hunniford and Julia Somerville.\u201d (Her Rip Off Britain co-hosts who are 79 and 72 respectively).\n\nAngela adds: \u201cThe fact that we are still here gives the women who came after us the confidence that they can be too.\n\n\u201cAnd, hopefully, they will all get the same salaries as the men. Equal pay for equal work. Because we may have broken through the glass ceiling but we haven\u2019t brought the bank with us.\u201d\n\n(Image: DZ PICTURES)\n\nShe began as a photo-journalist and TV reporter in her native Devon before joining the BBC\u2019s national news in 1974.\n\nA year later she began reading the Nine O\u2019Clock News in the same week Margaret Thatcher became Tory leader.\n\nAngela became one of the best known faces in broadcasting. Roles included hosting coverage of Charles and Diana\u2019s wedding in 1981, the first series of Top Gear as well as Antiques Roadshow.\n\nIn 1983, Angela and fellow newsreader Anna Ford became part of ITV\u2019s Famous Five presenters who launched Britain\u2019s second breakfast TV show.\n\nBut it floundered and Angela was fired \u2013 finding herself out of work for a year.\n\nThen she landed a job with a US television station as an arts and entertainment correspondent.\n\nWhen she returned to Britain she was snapped up by the BBC as host of Come Dancing. It was perfect because Angela had trained in ballet as a youngster.\n\nIt still plays a huge part in her life. Angela was delighted when the Royal Academy of Dance asked her to become Ambassador of Silver Swans \u2013 ballet classes for the over-50s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d she says. \u201cI love going to classes. We do exercises based on barre and basic work dancers do.\n\n\"They strengthen the core, give you balance and flexibility but you also have to use your brain to remember the steps.\n\n\u201cWe get to know each other and have a laugh and people go out for coffee after and become great friends.\u201d\n\n(Image: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images for th)\n\nAngela reveals she even got the Duchess of Cornwall to take up dancing classes.\n\n\u201cCamilla wanted to see our classes as they link in with her work on osteoporosis. So she came to watch a class with her lady-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cShe spoke to the ladies and one of them told her \u2018My balance has imp\u00ad\u00adroved so much doing this that now I can put my knickers on standing up!\u2019\n\n\u201cBut watching the class she was almost joining in so I said \u2018You should come and join a class, Ma\u2019am\u2019.\n\n\u201cShe said \u2018Sadly, I don\u2019t think that would be possible\u2019. I told her \u2018Well, we could come to you\u2019 \u2013 and her face lit up.\n\n\"So now Sarah, our teacher, goes to Clarence House and the Duchess has ballet classes with her lady-in-waiting and some other members of staff.\n\n\u201cI saw the Duchess at an osteoporosis event recently and she said she was thrilled to be doing it. I told her I had noticed her posture had changed and she looked much more upright.\u201d\n\nSo, I ask Angela: \u201cI imagine you\u2019re too good a dancer for Strictly?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo good...!\u201d she splutters. \u201cGoodness, no \u2013 they\u2019ve just never asked me. I think it\u2019s because I presented Come Dancing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have loved to have done it but I\u2019m probably a bit too old now. Yes, I\u2019m still very supple and can do lots, but not all the lifts and things they do now.\u201d\n\nAngela doesn\u2019t look a day over 50, but she promises me she has never had any work done.\n\nHer expressive eyes sparkle below those arched brows which always made even the dullest headlines seem fascinating.\n\nAs we\u2019re talking about dancing she suddenly sweeps her arm high above her head with an elegant balletic flourish \u2013 and I am transported back 40-odd years to more television gold.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBecause I half expect Angela to push back the desk, kick her long legs in the air and burst into a dance routine like she did with Eric and Ern on their 1976 Christmas Special.\n\nShe still gets asked about it all the time. \u201cIt is lovely when people say \u2018Ooh, what was it like? I loved Morecambe and Wise\u2019.\n\n\"It\u2019s a link to two legendary entertainers sadly no longer with us. And, yes, it\u2019s another little bit of TV history I can say I was part of.\u201d\n\nAngela then shows me that while she can get her left arm up above her head her right one won\u2019t go up to meet it.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising considering she had major surgery four weeks earlier... a full shoulder replacement. \u201cI injured my shoulder while filming and had the tendons done last October,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut the pain I had been getting for two years was due to arthritis and my surgeon said there was only one thing to do \u2013 replace the lot of it.\n\n\u201cSo now I have a bionic shoulder. I can\u2019t wait to go through airport security because I\u2019ve got titanium pins in it and all the bells and whistles will go off.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cBut I\u2019m religiously doing my exercises and I\u2019ll be back at dance class this week.\u201d\n\n\u2018My men are off-limits\u2019\n\nAngela met engineer Christopher Dare when she was 17, and aged 22 married him in 1967.\n\nThey separated in 1989 and since then she has kept that part of her life private.\n\nShe says: \u201cI never talk about the men in my life because I respect their privacy.\n\n\"I am the one who does a public job not them.\n\n\"So, since my divorce I\u2019ve made it clear to my lovers that they don\u2019t have be in the spotlight.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: In her peripheral vision, she could see the highly respected BBC newsman \u201cwith something white in his hand which was being waggled around\u201d", "authors": ["Rachael Bletchly", "Image", "Dz Pictures", "Press Association", "Dave J Hogan Getty Images For Th", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20636988.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JIP_CHP_161019rippon_1764JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
