It is now more likely total asset sales for 2019 will come in near or above the $2 billion mark. This should eliminate any need for the company to assume a preferred share issuance.\n\nThe case for turning bullish on the Calgary-based energy infrastructure company is based on expectations for leverage to notably decline, the analyst wrote. Specifically, management is targeting a net debt to EBITDA ratio of around 5.5 times with a long-term goal of 5.0 to 5.5 times FFO/debt target of 13-15%. As the company progresses towards its goal it can turn off the DRIP program, self-fund future growth, and potentially resume dividend increases.\n\nIn addition, earnings should expand from lower interest expenses and secured growth backlog which focuses on the U.S. utility space and midstream investments, the analyst wrote. In addition, the company could see earnings benefits from requested utility rate cases.\n\nFinally, AltaGas' stock is trading with a P/E multiple of around 14 to 15 times which is a discount to utilities at 18 times and pipelines at 16 times.\n\n\"While we acknowledge further evidence of improvement needs to be seen for valuation expansion, we believe the current trading level more than accounts for this caution,\" the analyst wrote.\n\nPrice Action\n\nShares of AltaGas were trading higher by 2.2% Monday afternoon at C$18.73.\n\nRelated Links\n\n3 Reasons To Consider Investing In Cannabis\n\nGetting Active With A Financial Services ETF\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
