They say the tipping point was a whistleblower complaint that alleged the president abused his authority by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter.\n\nMr. Trump has denied the charges and questioned how he could be impeached when he\u2019s doing such a great job and things are going so well in the country.\n\nHe also said Thursday he has \u201cNEVER\u201d had a good Fox News poll dating back to the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck,\u201d the president tweeted.\n\n\u201cBut @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days,\u201d he added, taking shots at several network personalities. \u201c@FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nThe Fox News poll of 1,003 registered voters in the U.S. was taken from Oct. 6-8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
