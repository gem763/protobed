It is expected to determine whether the world's two largest economies are starting to chart a path out of their 14-month trade war or headed for new and higher tariffs on each others' goods.\n\nCancellation of the Chinese agriculture visits, which were seen as potentially leading to increased purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork, caused Wall Street's main stock indexes to fall as early optimism about the talks faded.\n\nGrain and soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade and livestock futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also slumped. China is the world's largest pork market and the largest importer of soybeans.", "description": "China and the United States had \"constructive\" discussions on trade in Washington, state news agency Xinhua said on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106096088-1566778497612gettyimages-1058471374.jpeg?v=1567647638", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
