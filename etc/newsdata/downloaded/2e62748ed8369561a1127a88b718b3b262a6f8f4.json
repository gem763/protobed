It\u2019s for all the people that lost their lives and all the people that did so much to help.\u201d\n\nPITTSBURGH PIRATES' KYLE CRICK SUFFERS SEASON-ENDING INJURY AFTER BRAWL WITH TEAMMATE\n\nAlonso said he avoided going through MLB because he felt like the cleats may not have been approved.\n\n\u201cI felt if MLB got their hands on it, it may not have been approved,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy we banded together in the clubhouse and made something cool happen.\u201d\n\nMILWAUKEE BREWERS' CHRISTIAN YELICH BREAKS KNEECAP, WILL MISS REMAINDER OF SEASON\n\nAlonso, who won the MLB Home Run Derby in July and donated a portion of his winnings to the Wounded Warriors Project and Tunnel to Towers, said the terror attacks had a profound effect on him as a first grader in Florida. He said it is a moment in his life he would never forget.\n\n\u201cI want to bring awareness to people on the outside looking in that this is a really big deal,\u201d he said.\n\nAlonso posted a photo of the cleats along with a caption remembering those who died on that day.\n\nEven though Alonso went 0-for-3 with a run, the Mets defeated the Diamondbacks 9-0 in eerie fashion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNew York scored 9 runs on 11 hits.", "description": "As the old saying goes, it\u2019s better to ask for forgiveness than permission.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
