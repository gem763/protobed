Senator Kamala Harris was taken to task for denying inmates gender reassignment surgery when she was California attorney general.\n\nThe two-hour forum was the first dedicated to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender voters since 2007, when same-sex marriage was illegal.\n\n\u201cAmericans think that marriage equality was the finish line for the LGBTQ community,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, president of the advocacy group Glaad, a co-organizer of the forum. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize we can get fired or put through so-called conversion therapy. That\u2019s why this forum was so important.\u201d\n\nWhat I hope Bernie would learn is you don\u2019t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community Angelica Ross\n\nIn her own Q&A, Ross spoke to the Guardian.\n\nHow did it feel to be part of such a historic moment?\n\nAbout damn time is how I feel! And not just for myself \u2013 but for black trans women whose voices have been so powerful, necessary and missing in this movement. It was great to start the show off with the tone that we need to be aware of the issues facing black trans folk. And then to see all of the candidates pretty much address that issue or have something to say towards it. I thought everyone did an incredible job.\n\nOne of the most visceral statements came from Elizabeth Warren, who read the names of 18 trans women of color killed this year. What did you think of that?\n\nFor me, it felt like more than an opportunistic moment. She is someone who is invested [in the LGBTQ community]. I\u2019ve seen her on the trail with my black trans sister Ashlee Marie Preston [an activist].\n\nThere were so many questions, but this was only a two-hour forum. There was so much more to cover. Especially the fact that many folks in the LGBTQ community are celebrating the arraignment of Ed Buck for his terror on black gay bodies. Bodies that no one is supposed to care about because they are marginalized, living on the street, poor, disadvantaged, etc.\n\nAs an LGBTQ community, we have to have leaders. Even if we get someone like Pete [Buttigieg] \u2013 it\u2019s wonderful and so historic to know that we have an openly gay candidate running for president. But I want to see that just as you\u2019re strong on issues facing LGBTQ people, you\u2019re also strong on issues facing people of color. That you don\u2019t have these blind spots and that you are not only willing to answer these tough questions, but also willing to solve. I think that there are a lot more questions that me and our community have.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on candidates like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Bernie Sanders skipping the event? Sanders will also miss the next LGBTQ forum, in October.\n\nI was disappointed to not see all of the candidates here. I was further disappointed to hear this was not the only LGBTQ event Bernie was making other commitments for. You don\u2019t show up for both of our LGBTQ events? That\u2019s obviously telling us all we need to know.\n\nWhy do you think Bernie has decided to skip the forums?\n\nI do have some inside information \u2013 because I did try to do some digging as to why Bernie was not here. I sent out some questions to folks who were surrounding his camp. And that\u2019s when I found out Bernie had prior commitments.\n\nI\u2019m going to risk being super real here for a second. When you\u2019re on the campaign trail, what\u2019s happening a lot \u2013 and what a lot of these candidates have to avoid \u2013 is being seen as looking for a photo op. To be seen in certain communities and spaces. I heard that he was not only visiting the [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] but also visiting an old black barbershop.\n\nI\u2019m already struggling as a black trans advocate to get folks in my own black community to understand that being black and being LGBTQ are not mutally exclusive. What I hope Bernie would learn is you don\u2019t have to pander to just one aspect of the black community. If he would have been at the LGBTQ forum tonight, he would have seen we were talking about issues affecting people of color. I think it was a huge misstep on his part. And I\u2019m not here for any of the excuses. I say: \u201cMake it up to me. Make it up to us.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting moment was TV host Karamo Brown\u2019s brief appearance on stage. He recently faced criticism for calling Sean Spicer a \u2018nice guy\u2019.\n\nI love Karamo. At the end of the day, he is my brother. But I also love my brother enough to tell him when he\u2019s wrong. We had a very in-depth conversation right before we went on stage. Him almost giving Sean Spicer a stamp of approval was wrong. But I also know Karamo knows it was wrong. As someone who is always in front of a camera, I don\u2019t always say what I mean to say. So I know he was kicking himself. And we actually talked about that. Because giving Sean Spicer a stamp of approval is not what he meant to say or do.\n\nWe also talked about deeper issues. Like the tension black gay men feel when they see more and more black athletes come out as gay and end up with white partners. We found a happy medium because he asked: \u201cWell, is everyone who has a white partner in the wrong?\u201d And I said no.\n\nThe only time I\u2019m against interracial dating is when you\u2019re not able to bring your full self to the relationship and advocate for yourself. If you feel silenced in your home and relationship, I\u2019m not for that. We just need to make people more aware: When you\u2019re choosing partners, are you really choosing them for your own reasons or for reasons you\u2019ve adopted?\n\nHow can we continue the conversation around LGBTQ rights \u2013 especially trans rights?\n\nI think we can continue the conversation by including trans people at every opportunity. Instead of having a special LGBTQ forum, how about making sure all voices are included in the conversation?\n\nHere\u2019s a fun question: which of the nominees do you think could win a voguing competition?\n\nMy money would be on \u2026 Kamala. Cory Booker, actually! I think he has enough swag for that.\n\nAnd what can we expect from your upcoming role in American Horror Story?\n\nI would just echo Ryan Murphy in saying that it\u2019s a truly groundbreaking role.
