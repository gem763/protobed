It was also flat against the euro (GBPEUR=X) at just above \u20ac1.12.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts said in a note to clients they did not expect EU leaders to agree to the offer, leaving their expectations of a deal unchanged at 20% and a no-deal Brexit unchanged at 50%.\n\nCommenting on one version of the proposals leaked shortly before their publication yesterday, they wrote: \u201cThe two major sticking points concern the physical infrastructure required on either side of the Irish border to implement the proposals, including customs infrastructure, which the Irish govern-ment has consistently rejected, and consequences for single market integrity arising from both Northern Ireland leaving the EU's VAT area, and exemption from level playing field provisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, at face value, we see limited prospects of this deal passing the UK parliament. The proposals facilitate a hard form of Brexit, with the UK leaving the orbit of the EU customs union and single market in not much over a year.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: UK construction in \u2018devastating\u2019 downturn as Brexit deters building\n\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, highlighted Johnson\u2019s delicate balancing act between giving ground to the EU and reassuring Conservative MPs wary of keeping Northern Ireland tied too closely to EU rules.\n\n\u201cHe needs to convince Eurosceptics to get this deal over the line. The biggest risk is that if he fails to secure enough backing from the parliament and the EU, an accidental no-deal Brexit is the only option,\u201d said Aslam.\n\nEuropean members of parliament are also expected to outline their opposition to the plans on Thursday, while Labour opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar have already criticised the proposals.", "description": "Johnson will hold talks with EU leaders in a crunch week for Britain after he set out his last-ditch proposals for a Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6SeDo_yZXp4I9500TGkQwQ--~B/aD0yODQ2O3c9NDM0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/26d5ce50-d9f2-11e9-b76f-71a60027c8b3"}
