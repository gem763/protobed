However, that all changed with China's very next routine. Sun Wei fell on a release, and suddenly the competition was Russia's for the taking.\n\nRussia finished with a total score of 261.726. That was 0.997 ahead of China, which had won the men's team event at seven of the last eight world championships.\n\nWATCH | Russia takes men's team title:\n\n2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships from Stuttgart, Germany. 3:15:09\n\nCanada, which won a bronze medal at the Pan Am Games in August, didn't qualify for Wednesday's final and placed 17th overall. The men's squad also failed to earn a quota spot on Monday for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo next summer.\n\nThe men's team in Germany included Ren\u00e9 Cournoyer (Repentigny, Que.), William \u00c9mard (Laval, Que.), Cory Paterson (Montreal, Que.), Jackson Payne (Calgary), Sam Zakutney (Ottawa) and Justin Karstadt (Toronto).\n\nThe top nine teams, excluding previous qualifiers China, Russia and Japan, earned tickets to Tokyo.\n\n\"Everyone involved \u2014 the athletes, the coaches, the judges, and their families \u2014 got behind the team effort and I thank them for that,\" Canada head coach Ed Van Hoof said earlier this week. \"As with every Olympic Games qualification, expectations were high. The team is much improved since Doha 2018 [at the world championships]. These guys gave their best, but unfortunately, we came up short.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it was the first time Russia had won this title since the Soviet Union's victory in 1991, although it won the Olympic gold medal in the same event in 1996. Another ex-Soviet nation, Belarus, took the world title in 2001, the last European nation to do so.\n\nJapan rounds out podium\n\nDalaloyan said he'd been tormented by the narrow defeat to China in 2018.\n\n\"For a whole year I couldn't sleep soundly because I didn't have that medal. A year ago we let it go with our errors when we were competing with the Chinese,\" Dalaloyan said.\n\nAmid Russia's celebrations, Dalaloyan walked over to the Chinese team and embraced each athlete including Sun, who was weeping and covered his face with a jacket.\n\n\"I did that out of respect for the Chinese team because I saw some people had tears in their eyes and started to remember myself a year ago,\" he said. \"I saw the frustration on the guys' faces and decided to support them because we're all friends, all people. I know what it's like to be second, so out of humanity I went over to support the guys.\"\n\nJapan took the bronze, continuing its run of reaching the men's team podium at every world championships since 2003. It was the first year since 1991 that the same three teams made the podium two years running.", "description": "Russia has won its first men's all-around team gymnastics world title since the end of the Soviet Union after a crucial fall from China, scoring 261.726 points to beat the Chinese, who had prevailed in the event at seven of the last eight world championships.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5314862.1570640200!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dalaloyan-artur-191009-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
