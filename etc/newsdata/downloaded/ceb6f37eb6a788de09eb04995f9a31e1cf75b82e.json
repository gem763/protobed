On Monday Siti Nurbaya Bakar, Indonesia\u2019s environment and forestry minister, said the move was off.\n\nAccording to government figures 1,727 Komodo dragons live on the island, which is a Unesco world heritage site. \u201c[The number of] Komodo dragons on Komodo island during 2002 to 2019 observations has been relatively stable,\u201d Bakar told Reuters. \u201cThere is no threat of a decline.\u201d\n\nKomodo considers tourist ban to help boost dragon numbers Read more\n\nThe ban would not have affected other areas of Komodo National Park. It was announced amid concerns that increasing numbers of tourists were affecting the animals\u2019 mating habits, with food handouts making them docile. There were also concerns about poachers targeting Komodo dragons and deer, their main prey.\n\nThe cancellation of the ban has added to a sense of confusion around the government\u2019s long-term vision for the park. In 2018 more than 176,000 tourists visited the area. In 2018 Viktor Bungtilu Laiskodat, governor of East Nusa Tenggara, proposed targeting high-end customers with a US $500 entry fee.\n\n\u201cOnly people with deep pockets are allowed to [see Komodo dragons],\u201d he said. \u201cThose who don\u2019t have the money shouldn\u2019t visit the park since it specifically caters to extraordinary people.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty sparked protests among the island\u2019s residents. Some feared being relocated to make way for new tourist infrastructure, or losing income from visitors during the proposed ban.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Komodo National Park, Indonesia Photograph: Alamy\n\nAlthough the ban was scrapped, the environment ministry said that changes will still occur around Komodo island. A new Komodo dragon research centre is expected to open in the park, with the ministry promising to revamp other tourist spots in the area.\n\nThe Komodo dragon, which can grow up to three metres long, kills its prey by biting it and infecting it with venomous saliva. It then lets the animal bleed to death.\n\nMuch is still being learned about the ancient lizard, which was only discovered by Europeans in the early 20th century.\n\nIn 2013, two people were taken to hospital after being attacked by a giant Komodo dragon that wandered into the office of a wildlife park in eastern Indonesia.\n\nIt is estimated there are about 5,700 Komodo dragons in the wild.", "description": "U-turn announced after environment minister said populations of the ancient lizard remained stable despite influx of visitors", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2e9d89b969b1aa06aba408f940a691d9aa66003/0_342_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=473c9deaae931c2480099db2f7847e42", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
