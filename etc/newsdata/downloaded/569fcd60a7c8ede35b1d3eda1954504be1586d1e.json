Seems like just yesterday we were all arriving on the Old Campus for Freshman Year!! Now, of course, some of us have kids who are arriving in New Haven to start their Yale careers! Amazing, right?! Did we ever think we\u2019d be this old or have gray hair? Don\u2019t answer that!!!\n\nCongrats to New York Times reporter Robin Pogrebin on the publication of her new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, which was all the talk a few weeks ago! Fun to see so many of the Class of \u201987 quoted in the book. I caught up with Robin and fellow classmate Max Stier, who is a big deal at the Partnership for Public Service, at a book party in D.C. and had fun reliving old memories of freshman year! Robin, Max, and Deborah Ramirez \u2014 who is also a star of the book!! \u2014 said they \u201chad a blast\u201d remembering the good ol\u2019 days and the \u201cBright College Years\u201d we all shared in New Haven. Our waistlines may have grown, and our hairlines receded (guilty as charged!), but our memories have held fast for 30 years!\n\nAfter the book event, we all went out for beers and caught up on each other\u2019s lives. It was fun to hang out with them and a few more from the Class of 1987 \u2014 amazing how many \u201987ers are front and center in D.C. as well as New York! \u2014 to discuss the serious and very important topic of sexual assault and its ramifications. Not to make light of such a \u201cheavy\u201d subject, but once again it was the Class of 1987 leading the way and tackling the big issues, just like we did back in New Haven. (Sane/Freeze, anyone??) But in between the frowns there was time for some smiles and laughter and remembering good times, or at least trying to remember!! (Anybody else have trouble remembering anything after a Mory\u2019s Gold Cup?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Legal disclaimer: After consultations with the editorial team at the Yale Alumni Magazine, the legal department at Yale University and its associated publications, and my personal attorney, I formally and without reservation declare that any and all memories associated with my freshman year at Yale and events I may or may not have witnessed and may or may not have had secondhand knowledge of are totally and completely forgotten and impossible to verify or recall with any confidence. Please refer any questions or further inquiry to my legal representatives.)\n\nFun to hear about other \u201987ers in the news! Party guy and DEKE member Brett Kavanaugh is currently on the Supreme Court of the United States, which is a lifetime post \u2014 not if Robin and Max and Deborah have anything to say about it!! \u2014 and he reports that he\u2019s \u201cpsyched to listen to arguments and mix it up with fellow Elis Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Samuel Alito.\u201d Sadly, Brett reports that he\u2019s \u201cswamped\u201d with his new duties and probably won\u2019t be able to come back to campus for our next reunion, which was sure to be an interesting one. Brett was always lots of fun to be around!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Legal disclaimer: See above.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne last note, from the \u201cWhatever happened to . . . ?\u201d file: Classmate Rob Long reports that he writes occasionally for an obscure conservative journal of opinion. Congrats, Rob!\n\nAs always, we need news! Whatever is going on in your life, we\u2019d love to catch up and spread the word! Please send your class notes, recollections, family news, etc. to your personal attorney for vetting and review and have your attorney forward them to the legal department at Yale University, ATTN: Publications Compliance Department, and they\u2019ll be sure to get them to us within the year!\n\nAnd remember: If you\u2019d like to accuse a fellow classmate of any misconduct, whether at Yale or subsequently, the university has set up a totally anonymous \u201cwhistleblower\u201d email address for each class. Please refer to your latest Yale Alumni Fund mailing for the email address for the Class of 1987. No need to use your real name or supply any identifying materials at all. The process is totally anonymous and cannot be traced back to you except by a fellow member of the Class of 1987 who is in the media and/or journalism fields.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee you all at the reunion!
