The boost in prices is being primarily driven by positive news from China\u2019s services sector.\n\nAt 10:52 GMT, October WTI crude oil is trading $54.47, up $0.53 or +0.98% and December Brent crude oil is at $57.86, up $0.39 or +0.68%.\n\nDespite the early strength, the buying has been tentative and is most likely being fueled by short-covering. The better-than-expected services sector data from China is not strong enough news to offset Tuesday\u2019s weak ISM US Manufacturing PMI data so I expect gains to be capped at some point today. Furthermore, Euro Zone activity shrank for a seventh month so there just isn\u2019t even bullish news from the global economy to sustain any long-term upside momentum.\n\nCiti Analysts Cut Brent Forecasts\n\nCiti cut its Brent forecasts for the third and fourth quarters by about $10 a barrel to $62 and $64 respectively, and expects the benchmark to fall to $53 by the end of 2020. Brent is about 23% lower than its peak for this year in April.\n\n\u201cNext year the curtailment of demand growth coming from lower GDP (gross domestic product) growth expectations and continuation of the U.S.-China trade war could shave more oil demand from the market,\u201d Citi analysts wrote.\n\nLower Demand Still an Issue\n\nThe positive services data from China is not a market turning event, but Tuesday\u2019s contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector is an important event that could be an early indication that future demand will fall.\n\nStephen Brennock of oil broker PVM said, \u201cThe bullish bandwagon seen earlier this year will not be making another appearance.\u201d He further added, \u201cSpearheading these dimming prospects (are)\u2026cooling global economic activity and intensifying trade tensions. The world economy is slowing and nowhere is this pullback in activity more apparent than in the manufacturing sector.\u201d\n\nDaily Forecast\n\nPrices could firm throughout the session if demand for risk continues to rise, but this is not expected to turn into a long-term event. It\u2019s just short-covering.\n\nLate in the day at 20:30 GMT, the American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its latest report on weekly inventories. This report could produce a volatile response.\n\nThe API report is expected to show inventories declined for a third straight week.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The positive services data from China is not a market turning event, but Tuesday\u2019s contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector is an important event that could be an early indication that future demand will fall.", "authors": ["James Hyerczyk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
