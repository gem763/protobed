And maybe she\u2019d go and live in Croxteth for a month to pick up the accent?\n\nAlthough, in my view, movie makers would be better off hiring Liverpudlian Killing Eve star Jodie Comer instead.\n\nShe is from just down the road and would nail the voice and appearance.\n\nThe potentially cringeworthy side of seeing someone imitate her is not the worst of it for Coleen.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWatching the drama unfold and what was behind her blaming Rebekah Vardy for leaking the personal stories, might be hardest to swallow.\n\nBecause whoever ends up playing Wayne Rooney\u2019s wife will explore the age-old theme of cold, calculating revenge.\n\nThis is already much more than a fictional whodunnit gripping our nation. Even Americans have sat patiently while it was all explained to them.\n\nMany have been impressed with Coleen\u2019s detective work, forensically investigating stories and social media, even planting fake news. And all building up to the big reveal on Instagram: It\u2019s... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\n\nBut compelling as it might be, my review of this thriller is a harsh one. I can\u2019t believe Coleen has so publicly outed her fellow WAG, who says she is innocent, to millions of strangers.\n\n(Image: Eamonn and James Clarke)\n\nCountless comments followed on Instagram, saying vile things about pregnant Rebekah.\n\nEven if someone has betrayed you, trashing them so publicly is not remotely cool.\n\nIt makes you just as bad as them \u2013 if not worse. And this kind of social media shaming goes on every day away from the Wag circuit. But you can soon lose the upper hand \u2013 and the sympathy of your audience.\n\nSure, catch someone out, but be classy about making your point, especially as kids are involved on both sides. Rebekah has hit back, asking why Coleen didn\u2019t speak to her, insisting someone else is responsible.\n\nIf I suspected a mate was betraying me, I\u2019d meet face to face, show her my evidence, and ask for an explanation.\n\nNot jump the gun and humiliate them. That just shows insecurity, immaturity and a plain nasty streak.\n\nWho knows where this toxic Wag war will end? What might Rebekah come out with next, if she\u2019s out for revenge?\n\nThere will be enough twists to come for TV series No2.\n\nUntil then, we\u2019ll be tuned for a new real-life episode.", "description": "Latest Wagatha Christie mystery is ripe for a TV show - but Coleen may regret her very public reveal", "authors": ["Saira Khan", "Image", "Splashnews.Com", "Getty Images", "Eamonn", "James Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555990.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Wags-at-War-Coleen-Rooney-Rebekah-Vardy-at-Euro-2016-STOCK-PHOTOS-TAKEN-ON-16-JUNE-2016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
