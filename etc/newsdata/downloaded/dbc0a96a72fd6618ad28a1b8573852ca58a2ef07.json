She also plans to embark on an Asian tour in December, which includes stops in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\n", "description": "Singer IU Delays Release of New Album", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/22/2019102201369_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
