Here are the main figures economists are expecting from the print, according to Bloomberg data:\n\nNonfarm payrolls: +145,000 vs. +130,000 in August\n\nUnemployment rate: 3.7%, vs. 3.7% in August\n\nAverage hourly earnings MoM: +0.2% vs. +0.4% in August\n\nAverage hourly earnings YoY: +3.2% vs. +3.2% in August\n\nThe labor market has so far seen fewer new positions added over the course of the year while the unemployment rate held near multi-decade lows. The three-month average for new payroll additions through August was 156,000, versus 241,000 over the same three months of 2018.\n\nPreviously released employment data for September has provided mixed signals as to whether the relative resilience of the labor market will hold up heading into the final quarter of the year.\n\n\u201cFor one, in the September survey week (the week that includes the 12th of the month), initial jobless claims continued to send no particular indication that firings have picked up and continues to show layoffs in the U.S. running at historically low levels,\u201d Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner wrote in a note Thursday. The four-week moving average for new unemployment claims was 208,000 during the week the Department of Labor conducts its September jobs report, versus a still-sanguine 212,500 now.\n\nTeamwork, Group of workers on a road construction, team of people at work More\n\nPlus, the Conference Board\u2019s labor market differential \u2013 which represents the difference between the percentage of consumers who say jobs are plentiful and the percentage saying jobs are hard to find \u2013 remained relatively high at 33.2 in September, suggesting the labor market remained tight.\n\nDisappointing data\n\nBut other data has been less upbeat around the employment situation. On Wednesday, ADP/Moody\u2019s released a report showing private sector payrolls rose by 135,000 in September, missing Bloomberg\u2019s consensus expectations by 5,000. August\u2019s private payroll additions were downwardly revised by 38,000 to 157,000.\n\nAnd after this week\u2019s gloomy data on both the manufacturing and services sides of the economy, the last thing investors want to see is a disappointing Labor Department jobs report.\n\nThis week, stocks were whipsawed after the Institute of Supply Management released two separate reports showing that both manufacturing and service sector activity fell to multi-year lows in September.\n\nSoftness in U.S. manufacturing activity has been well-documented this year amid an ongoing trade war, and has been reflected in hiring trends in goods-producing industries. Consensus economists expect the Labor Department\u2019s report will show just 3,000 manufacturing payrolls added in September, matching August\u2019s print for the fewest additions since April.\n\nOf more concern was the softness reflected in ISM\u2019s report on the service sector, which comprises a greater portion of domestic activity and saw growth slow to the lowest level in three years. Within this survey, the employment index fell to a five-year low of 50.4, holding just above the neutral level of 50 to indicate just slight expansion in hiring.\n\n\u201cThe message from the latest ISM surveys is unambiguous; firms are scaling back hiring plans quite aggressively,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cEven if the other components of our composite hiring index are unchanged in September, the message from the ISMs is that job growth is heading south.\u201d\n\nEchoing the sentiments of many economists, Shepherdson pointed to fallout from the trade war as cause for the deterioration, with manufacturing already in contractionary territory and the services sector \u201cextremely nervous over the impact of tariffs on consumer goods.\u201d", "description": "U.S. employers likely added workers at a slower rate in September, consensus economists believe, in another sign that a growth slowdown spread across the domestic economy.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wd7pVwnFBE1asgtBBnnPtg--~B/aD00MDE2O3c9NjAxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c18e3630-e622-11e9-97cf-b332133dea0b", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
