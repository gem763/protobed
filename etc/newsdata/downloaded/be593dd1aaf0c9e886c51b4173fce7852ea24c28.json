The documents paint the most detailed picture of what really happens to a school after a mass shooting. Once the funerals are over, the TV cameras leave and students attempt to return to normalcy, there have been dramatic turns for the worse in academic performance, behavior and mental wellness.\n\n\"Personally, I hate the word closure, because I don't think there ever is closure to anything like this,\" said Melissa Reeves, past president of the National Association of School Psychologists and an associate professor at Winthrop University in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cYou will have individuals that quite honestly within a couple months might be back to a typical day-to-day routine and not showing a whole lot of traumatic impacts,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cYou'll have other individuals that it could take years of recovery.\u201d\n\nThe details of what happened at these schools are laid out in applications for aid under a federal program aimed at helping schools recover from violent incidents.\n\nSanta Fe High School officials said that by the end of the school year that followed the shooting, approximately 60 percent of all students had visited with a counselor experienced in trauma, and the counselors provided more than 3,400 hours of support. In Parkland, since the shooting, requests for added support related to mental, physical and behavioral problems rose by 78 percent.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas used to rank near the bottom of high schools in the district for instances of substance abuse. After the shooting, it shot up 20 places on the list. Meanwhile, there has been a \u201cdramatic decrease\u201d in the school\u2019s passage rates for English and algebra assessments.\n\nThe grant applications also reveal how the toll of the shootings spreads throughout a school district.\n\nAcross the Broward County School district, where Parkland is located, incidents of drug use or possession grew from 511 incidents the previous year to 637 that school year. \"Other major offenses\" grew from 317 to 367. Physical attacks grew from 34 the previous year to 128.\n\nThreats and intimidation grew to 368 incidents compared to 337 the previous year and tobacco offenses to 439 from 127.\n\nThe applications are for a program known as Project SERV. The \u201cSchool Emergency Response to Violence\" cash is intended to fund education-related services to help schools recover from a violent or traumatic event. The grant program, which started in 2001, provides financial help for K-12 schools and colleges that have experienced \"a traumatic event of such magnitude as to severely disrupt the teaching and learning environment,\" according to the department.\n\nGrants also may be given to schools that have experienced suicide clusters, terrorism, major natural disasters, bus accidents, student homicides off campus and hate crimes committed against students or staff.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for much-needed outside funding sources to assist in the physical and emotional recovery effort, as well as, planning for future violence prevention and mental/emotional health training and support,\u201d the Santa Fe Independent School District\u2019s 2019/2020 request states.\n\nThe shootings last year were among the deadliest ever for high schools in the U.S. Marjory Stoneman Douglas tops the list with 14 students and three staff members killed on Feb. 14, 2018. Santa Fe High School lost eight students and two teachers on May 18, 2018.\n\nThe Department of Education last year awarded the Broward County Public Schools and Santa Fe Independent School District $1 million each in Project SERV grants to help in the immediate aftermath of the shootings. The applications for additional money detail continuing intense needs. Newtown, Conn., Public Schools received more than $6.4 million in Project SERV grants in the years after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nThe Education Department said it is reviewing the school districts' requests for additional funds.\n\nLauren Hogg, a 16-year-old Parkland survivor who co-founded March for Our Lives, told House lawmakers during a school security hearing last month that she and her friends are re-traumatized with every new shooting and that \u201cevery single aspect\u201d of her life has changed.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Mandatory recommendations for expulsion have doubled, particularly for assaults, threats and the possession or sale of marijuana, the request states.\n\nThe district needs additional staff, including school social workers to assist students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and feeder schools, according to the request. \u201cThere has been an increase in mental health concerns among students at MSD as exhibited by anxiety, depression, cutting/self-injurious behavior, school avoidance, suicidal ideation, illegal substance usage, etc.,\u201d the document explains.\n\nAlso, additional instruction time after school is needed for credit recovery programs for students who didn\u2019t complete the spring 2018 semester.\n\nThe school district in Santa Fe has boosted its security and police presence because of increases in student misconduct requiring disciplinary measures, according to its grant application. But their presence has also helped students experiencing a \u201ccontinued fear factor of attending school\u201d have a feeling of safety, the application said. Students will require emotional and mental health help \u201cfor the coming year and for years to come.\n\nThe district has hired a crisis communications firm, which is helping to establish a Citizens Advisory Task Force, and it continues to rely on support personnel to track student absenteeism. Faculty and staff still need additional training in self-care, trauma-informed strategies and suicide awareness and prevention to assist traumatized students.\n\n\u201cBased on data from districts who have experienced similar strategies, the incidence of suicide increases following the one-year mark of the tragedy,\u201d the application said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/24/86/b8165e6844929d46f1d915e14b75/191009-parkland-stoneman-douglas-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
