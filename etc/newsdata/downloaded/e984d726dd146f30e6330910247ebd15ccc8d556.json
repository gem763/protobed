We\u2019ll split the analysis into three groups: very cheap, mid-tier, and expensive. A greater emphasis will be placed on the lower end of the price scale.\n\nPlease note, these player picks were organized early in the day. For MLB contests, always check lineups and weather closer to game time. Rain, wind, or unexpected managerial decisions could open up additional sources of value. Be sure to keep an eye on the MLB Headlines and Injuries desk.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Stay ahead of the competition from wire to wire with rankings, customizable projections, trade evaluator, exclusive columns and more in our Season Pass.

The Tigers second-best starter has managed only three wins (and 15 losses) despite a fairly successful campaign. Among his strengths is an ability to induce whiffs, leading to nearly a strikeout per inning (8.59 K/9). With their top-heavy offense, the Indians are a roughly neutral matchup these days. Turnbull projects to throw between five and six innings with roughly as many strikeouts. He should easily outperform his price tag even the end result isn\u2019t exactly a carrying performance.\n\nJ.P. Crawford \u2013 SS \u2013 Seattle Mariners (at Dario Agrazal)\n\nStory continues\n\nMore often than not, we\u2019ve hunted cheap home runs in this column. Crawford doesn\u2019t offer much power upside tonight \u2013 perhaps a one-in-ten chance for a big fly. He\u2019s interesting because he offers multi-hit potential against a Triple-A quality pitcher and a suddenly depleted bullpen. This pick is about getting some production rather than a big burst. His role as the second hitter in the Mariners lineup is a big part of the draw.\n\nJoey Wendle \u2013 2B/3B \u2013 Tampa Bay Rays (at Tony Gonsolin)\n\nSpeaking of lineup roles, Wendle is expected to bat leadoff tonight. Since returning to action in late-August, he\u2019s put this nightmare season behind him by hitting .313/.357/.469 in 70 plate appearances. Everything about his profile is more in line with his very solid 2018 performance. A rejuvenated Wendle offers a similar profile to Crawford except with a little more where it counts for DFSers. The Dodgers pitching staff makes for a tough matchup, although I don\u2019t expect them to go full throttle.\n\nRowdy Tellez \u2013 1B \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays (at Dylan Bundy)\n\nOf course, no bargain bin is complete without a low-cost, high-risk, multi-homer threat. Bundy is among the most consistently homer prone pitchers in the league, frequently serving up multiple blasts in any given start. Tellez continues to struggle with the adjustment from Triple-A to the majors. Since his latest promotion in mid-August, he\u2019s batting .189/.265/.419 with a 30.1 percent strikeout rate. The power output is an obvious strength, but he\u2019ll need to learn to make more contact. His batted ball profile hints at plenty of upside, although such long term considerations aren\u2019t very relevant to our purposes tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Adrian Houser, Andrew Velazquez, Zack Collins, D.J. Stewart, Jake Cave, Shed Long, Christin Stewart, Kyle Lewis, Colin Moran\n\nMID-TIER MUST PLAYS\n\nAristides Aquino \u2013 OF \u2013 Cincinnati Reds (at Jon Lester)\n\nAquino is roughly tied with Nelson Cruz for the likeliest to hit a home run tonight. Wrigley Field is expected to have a mild cross breeze out to left field. The Punisher is basically an all-or-nothing selection. His aggressive, fly ball oriented approach produces plenty of home runs but also runs the risk of zeroing out. In a small sample, he\u2019s proven especially lethal to left-handed pitchers.\n\nAlso Consider: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Franmil Reyes, C.J. Cron, Max Kepler\n\nHIGH PRICED VALUES\n\nGerrit Cole \u2013 SP \u2013 Houston Astros (vs Rangers)\n\nCole has one of the highest prices we\u2019ve seen all season and yet he\u2019s also one of the best dollar-for-dollar values in this slate. The reason is a strikeout prone opponent and a season of consistent dominance. Cole projects to outperform the next best pitcher by upwards of 30 percent. There\u2019s nothing complicated to evaluate here. Every season, a few pitchers break the DFS pricing scale. Cole is one of those guys this year. Expect around seven innings and 10 strikeouts. The only downside to using Cole \u2013 besides the need to use some of the bargain bats above \u2013 is that he\u2019ll be hugely popular.\n\nAlso Consider: Dinelson Lamet, Nelson Cruz, Austin Meadows", "description": "Brad Johnson reviews his favorite MLB DFS bargain targets for Wednesday, September 18.
