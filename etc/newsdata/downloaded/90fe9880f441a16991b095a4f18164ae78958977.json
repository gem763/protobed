Denmark\u2019s Margrethe Vestager will hold onto the competition tsar role in which she has already spent five years ruffling feathers on both sides of the Atlantic. That wins incoming president of the European Union executive, Ursula von der Leyen, kudos even before she takes office.\n\nVestager was one of three senior executive vice presidents in von der Leyen\u2019s team who were named on Tuesday pending the European Parliament\u2019s approval. The Dane\u2019s responsibilities will also include coordinating efforts to create a \u201cEurope fit for the digital age\u201d, in the words of her new boss.\n\nVestager is up to the challenges of such a huge portfolio. Her efforts to weaken technology monopolies have led to multibillion dollar fines against the likes of Alphabet-owned Google. She can now see through an investigation into Amazon\u2019s dual-role as both as marketplace and merchant, as well as a nascent study of Facebook\u2019s currency Libra. The Dane will have the chance to rethink how antitrust policy approaches data monopolies like Facebook and Google, as recommended earlier this year by a report that she commissioned.\n\nAll that is likely to irk U.S. President Donald Trump, who has in the past complained that Vestager \u201chates the United States perhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met\u201d. He may not like Europe\u2019s new trade commissioner, Ireland\u2019s Phil Hogan, any better. Hogan on Tuesday called Trump \u201creckless\u201d on trade and said he wants to make the president see the \u201cerror of his ways\u201d.\n\nVestager\u2019s reappointment will also grab the attention of chief executives, investment bankers and politicians who favour mergers to create European industrial champions. She blocked the Siemens-Alstom, rail merger earlier this year despite heavy Franco-German lobbying, and opposed several telecommunications deals which would probably have led to higher mobile prices. That means she\u2019s unlikely to give in easily to pressure from Paris and Berlin to water down competition rules.\n\nBy picking a political heavyweight with the credibility to withstand intense pressure, von der Leyen is in some ways setting out her own stall. Vestager\u2019s credibility burnishes that of von der Leyen and the new team she has picked.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - The new European Commission has got off to a good start before it has even started work.
