Fox decided to go with a real eclectic committee approach in lieu of one person guiding us through the ceremony opening with jokes, which amounted to Homer Simpson \u201cwalking out\u201d on the stage before being clobbered by a piano, Anthony Anderson running out from the crowd to \u201csave\u201d the show by finding just the right person to get the program back on track, and then Bryan Cranston coming out to talk with gravitas about how great TV is. There\u2019s no arguing that it\u2019s definitely, uh, something that happened.\n\nRelated", "description": "A piano fell on Homer Simpson and Anthony Anderson tried to save the 2019 Emmys during the show\u2019s hostless introduction.
