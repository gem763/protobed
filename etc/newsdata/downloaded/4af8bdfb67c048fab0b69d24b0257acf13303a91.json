Great player but never buys a beer - Toomua", "language": "en", "text": "OITA, Japan (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s Matt Toomua listed the weaknesses of his former team mates in the England squad on Thursday but his inside knowledge may not be a great deal of use to his Wallabies team mates in Saturday\u2019s World Cup quarter-final.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - Rugby World Cup 2019 - Pool D - Australia v Wales - Tokyo Stadium, Tokyo, Japan - September 29, 2019 Australia's Matt Toomua scores a penalty REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nThe 29-year-old played with England flyhalf George Ford, centre Manu Tuilagi, scrumhalf Ben Youngs, winger Jonny May and prop Dan Cole at Leicester Tigers for three years and said he was prepared to reveal all to reporters in Oita.\n\n\u201cI will list (their weaknesses) now for you if you want?\u201d Toomua deadpanned at a news conference.\n\n\u201cManu is a terrible snooker player, George Ford never pays for a beer, Ben Youngs isn\u2019t even the best rugby player in his family, let alone the country.\n\n\u201cThe chicken, Jonny May, very weird and Dan Cole doesn\u2019t have a personality. So I have just been telling everyone about that.\u201d\n\nLike Ford \u2014 who was a shock omission from England\u2019s starting line-up for the match \u2014 Toomua will start on the bench at Oita Stadium and said, joking aside, that he had a healthy respect for his former club mates.\n\n\u201cLook, we obviously had a very good relationship with a lot of the fellas there and one thing I do know is that they\u2019re all quality players,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObviously I have been sharing the knowledge I have got on them as well but the thing is with guys like that, there are no glaring weaknesses. Besides the fact that George never pays for a beer, there is no glaring weakness.\u201d\n\nToomua is not alone in the Australia camp in having a former club mate on the other side of the fence for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nWallabies coach Michael Cheika and his England counterpart Eddie Jones played together at Sydney\u2019s famous Randwick club, where they were both mentored by the recently deceased Jeff Sayle.\n\n\u201cI think \u2018Cheik\u2019 has done a really good job,\u201d Jones told reporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the job he does. He\u2019s a good old mate of mine and there will be a bloke in the sky who will be quite excited about Michael and I coaching against each other this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s having a few beers next to St Peter now looking at the situation.\u201d\n\nCheika was less effusive when asked about Jones, pausing before bemoaning the fact that, like England\u2019s recent cricket coach Trevor Bayliss and current rugby league boss Wayne Bennett, he was an Australian helping out a rival.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been there for a bit now he\u2019s done a good job but always hurts me when there\u2019s an Aussie over there, you know what I mean?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTrevor Bayliss and Eddie, Wayne Bennett, you know, because you want them at home. But it is what it is.\u201d", "description": "Australia's Matt Toomua listed the weaknesses of his former team mates in the England squad on Thursday but his inside knowledge may not be a great deal of use to his Wallabies team mates in Saturday's World Cup quarter-final.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441855820&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G11B", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
