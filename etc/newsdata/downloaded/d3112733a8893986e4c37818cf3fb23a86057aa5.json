Catcher Technology, a Taiwanese company that manufactures metal casings for Apple products, may also make parts for Apple's AR glasses. In an interview with Nikkei Asian Review, Allen Horng, the chairman of Catcher Technology, did not confirm what project his company is working on, but there has been speculation that it's working on Apple's AR product given that the company already works with Apple on its product casings. Apple filed a patent in 2017 for a head-mounted, touch-screen display that could work with an iPhone. The firm made its first step into the AR world with the launch of ARKit The Apple AR glasses patent details a head-mounted, touch-screen display that could work alongside an iPhone. It also presents a way of representing points of interest (a landmark or an object such as a moving car) in a view of a real environment on an iPhone screen, with interaction functionality. As such, the iPhone could potentially connect to the AR headset, allowing the wearer to see point of interest in real time.\n\nThere had been conflicting reports about whether Apple's AR projects had been canceled.\n\nThe latest round of reports were based on test code found in the upcoming iOS 13 update, which when taken alongside other AR patents filed by the company, suggest the plans are, or were, in a relatively advanced state.\n\nApple has long been rumored to be developing its own pair of AR glasses. The tech giant has filed a patent this year that gives a glimpse into what it may be developing behind closed doors", "description": "New patent from Apple shows the tech giant is researching a move into apparel, with fabric band that could fit into socks or pants and measure breathing, blood pressure, ECG data.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/19/19454920-0-image-a-13_1570557925203.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
