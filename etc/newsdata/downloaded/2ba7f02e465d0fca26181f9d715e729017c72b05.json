This is more important than political wanderings on which he has gone astray,\u201d commented Austrian daily Die Presse.\n\nBut other prominent writers criticised the decision on Twitter, including novelist Joyce Carol Oates of the United States, who was cited as a possible winner.\n\n\u201cWhat is this sympathy for slaughterers and not for victims?\n\n\u201cUsually, writers are instinctively on the side of the oppressed and helpless,\u201d she tweeted.\n\n\u2013 Appetite for scandal \u2013\n\n\u201cI wrote about Handke\u2019s idiocies 20 years ago,\u201d said British author Salman Rushdie stressing his \u201cdisgust with genocide denialists\u201d.\n\nIn the 1990s, Handke emerged as a vocal defender of the Serbs during the bloody collapse of the former Yugoslavia, even comparing them to Jews under the Nazis, a remark he later retracted.\n\nHis 1996 travelogue \u201cA Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia\u201d, caused a storm, and in 1999 he returned Germany\u2019s prestigious Buechner prize in protest at NATO\u2019s bombing of Belgrade.\n\nHandke also attended the 2006 funeral of Milosevic \u2014 who died while on trial for crimes against humanity, and who wanted Handke to testify in his defence.\n\nLike the late Susan Sontag, who was mobilised in the defence of Sarajevo during its 1992-1995 siege by Bosnian Serbs, Rushdie strongly criticised Handke after his travelogue.\n\n\u201cI guess the Nobel committee\u2019s appetite for scandal hasn\u2019t been sated,\u201d British novelist Hari Kunzru tweeted sarcastically.\n\nUS novelist of Bosnian origin Aleksandar Hemon, who left Sarajevo just ahead of the conflict, did not hide his anger.\n\n\u201cPeter Handke is a genocide denier. He supported Milosevic all the way through. What a disgrace!\u201d\n\nMilosevic was tried notably over his role in the Sarajevo siege that claimed 11,000 lives and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim males, the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.\n\n\u2013 \u2018When it will snow\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn a fierce editorial The Times newspaper criticised what it labelled a \u201cperverse choice for literature laureate\u201d.\n\n\u201cArtistic qualities are independent of politics, and there have been previous laureates of insanitary opinions\u2026\n\n\u201cYet Handke excels in infamy, as his output over the past 25 years has been dominated by drama and prose relating to the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia,\u201d commented the British paper, opining that the award \u201cinsults the victims of genocide\u201d.\n\nThe polemical reaction to the award continued Friday in the Balkans.\n\nIn Kosovo, a petition urging that Handke be stripped of his Nobel prize had gathered nearly 30,000 signatures by Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cEvery writer who thinks that his \u2018genius\u2019 puts him outside categories of good and bad cannot be called a human being,\u201d Bosnian writer Faruk Sehic said.\n\nFor him Handke was an \u201capologist of evil\u201d.\n\nIn Serbia, Handke\u2019s award was perceived with general indifference.\n\nThe Vecernje Novosti daily paper, close to the government, has however put on its front page the Austrian writer who gave several interviews to Serbian media, including to Radio Belgrade, announcing a visit in \u201clate November, when it will snow\u201d.\n\nThe 1990s wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, that accompanied Yugoslavia\u2019s break-up, claimed around 130,000 lives and forced millions of people to flee their homes.", "description": "Belgrade (AFP) \u2013 Austrian writer Peter Handke\u2019s Nobel literature prize win has irked the Balkans, while voices beyond the region spoke out", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/94b030_austrian-writer-peter-handke-nobel-literature-prize-win-has-irked-balkans-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
