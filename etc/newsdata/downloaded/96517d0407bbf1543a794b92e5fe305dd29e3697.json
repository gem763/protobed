Many delegates this year have no qualms about getting close to Saudi.\"\n\nGlobal banks and consultants are vying for business around the much-delayed initial public offering of state oil giant Aramco, the world's most profitable company.", "description": "Last year saw top CEOs boycott the event over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by 'rogue agents'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2018/10/24/7e0b221351ac459c9d01480f2a92223d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
