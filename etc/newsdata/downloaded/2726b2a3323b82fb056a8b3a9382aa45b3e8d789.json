You can sign up to become a Drive-Thru subscriber here \u2014 which means that every Friday, I'll send you a rundown on what happened in retail over the last week.\n\nAnd, this week was a busy one!\n\nThe CEOs of Under Armour and Nike announce surprise departures on the same day.\n\nNike CEO Mark Parker will be replaced in January. Mike Lawrie/Nike\n\nUnder Armour kicked off Tuesday with a bang, announcing that CEO and founder Kevin Plank would be stepping down after 23 years, to be replaced by Patrik Frisk, the company's president and chief operating officer.\n\nHours later, Nike announced that CEO Mark Parker would be stepping down after 13 years, to be replaced by former eBay CEO John Donahoe.\n\nIt came as a surprise that the two executives would make such similar announcements on the same day.\n\nExperts are hoping that Frisk brings change and reinvention to Under Armour, while some are questioning the decision against bringing in fresh blood. Meanwhile, Donahoe is set to continue Parker's digital push at Nike, though some analysts voiced confusion as to why Nike didn't promote internally.\n\nTo understand what exactly is going on, you should read:\n\nNordstrom's flagship store is out of control.\n\nA Burberry caf\u00e9 inside the new Nordstrom flagship. Bethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nNordstrom has been heavily hyping its massive New York City flagship store. The 320,000 square feet of retail space opened this week, and Bethany was there to report on the chaos.\n\nHighlights include:\n\nMassive crowds that made it almost impossible to shop.\n\nFacial workouts by FaceGym.\n\nA gender-neutral bathroom sign made out of lipstick.\n\nMochi doughnuts, a bar, and an Instagram-ready Burberry caf\u00e9.\n\nBarneys' bankruptcy and sale to Authentic Brands Group for $271 million has been seen by many as the death of a certain brand of luxury retail that once thrived, especially in New York City. Nordstrom clearly wants to help usher in a new era of experimental luxury shopping. But, it remains to be seen if a selfie-centric store can actually bring people back to old-school shopping centers.\n\nCheck out what it was like to visit Nordstrom's flagship store on its opening day here.\n\nChick-fil-A's reputation might actually be catching up with the chain.\n\nChick-fil-A is growing internationally. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nChick-fil-A's first store in the UK will be short-lived, with the shopping center saying it won't renew the chain's lease when it's up in six months.\n\nIt was never really clear whether Chick-fil-A actually wanted to keep this \"pilot\" location in Reading open in the long term. And, the chain quietly opened a location in Scotland around the same time, and that restaurant hasn't shown any sign of closing.\n\nI tend to be skeptical of how much bad press actually impacts Chick-fil-A. Sales have more than doubled since 2012, reaching $10.5 billion in 2018, up from $4.6 billion. But, it does seem like the protest led by LGBTQ activists in Reading and online backlash played a role in the closure \u2014 or, at the very least, the narrative around why it would shut down.\n\nWhen I was reporting a big piece on Chick-fil-A's culture over the summer, experts told me that the only way that Chick-fil-A's reputation would actually impact its financials is through expansion, especially international expansion. At the beginning of 2019, Chick-fil-A only existed in the US. For the next six months, at least, it is in three countries: the US, Canada, and the UK.\n\nWhile Chick-fil-A has old-school vibes, most people underestimate its ability to evolve. Watch this space to see whether Chick-fil-A can pull off a reputational evolution now that boycotts are actually impacting its plans.\n\nRead me on Chick-fil-A's reputation catching up with it here. Plus, if you're confused about what the chain is actually donating to, I've got an explainer on that as well.\n\nPeloton bikers are sick of being forced to listen to '80s music after spending $2,000 on a bike.\n\nMary talked to Peloton users who are annoyed by subpar playlists after the company was hit with a $300 million lawsuit.\n\nIn the words of one bike owner: \"The music now consists of TONS of '80s music (and not even good '80s music for the most part \u2014 think doing an ab workout to a slow jam by Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam), a few rap artists, and a bunch of stuff I've never heard of for the most part.\"\n\nRead more about the complaints here.\n\nVSCO girls are killing the Kardashian-spawned era of cosmetics.\n\nVSCO girls are changing the cosmetics landscape. LaurDIY/YouTube\n\nMakeup sales are down, with consumers \"spending more on skincare at the expense of makeup,\" according to UBS analysts. Skin-care routines tend to require fewer items.\n\nHayley broke down what this really means: Bare-faced VSCO girls are ending the Kardashian-led era of contouring and lip kits to bring in a new reign of Carmex, Burt's Bees, and Mario Badescu facial sprays.\n\nIf you think Gen Z's makeup trends are beneath you... sksksksk. Educate yourself here.\n\nTaste test of the week: Fill the chicken sandwich-shaped hole in your heart with Popeyes new pumpkin pie.\n\nIrene loved Popeyes' pumpkin pie. Irene Jiang / Business Insider\n\nPopeyes' chicken sandwich seems to be on the cusp of a return, with a major franchisee telling Bloomberg the sandwich will return in early November. But, as customers anxiously await the day, Irene suggests trying the chain's new pumpkin pie.\n\nIrene's take: \"There wasn't a single stale bite of this pie. Every single bite burst with flavor. My only complaint was that there weren't enough bites.\"\n\nVisuals that will make you want to visit Popeyes even before the chicken sandwich returns are here.\n\nEverything else you need to know", "description": "Under Armour's and Nike's CEOs announce surprise departures, Nordstrom's flagship store is out of control, and Chick-fil-A faces more backlash.", "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daf7ccd4af9091e8a214765?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
