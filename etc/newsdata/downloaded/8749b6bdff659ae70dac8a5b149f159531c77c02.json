Beautiful cake, too bad they ran out of time to proofread the topper.\"\n\nOthers pointed out that the cake could easily be made more child-friendly by taking off the topper.", "description": "A baker made a spooky ghost cake for a Halloween party, but didn't realise blunder until they were done", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20755507.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Halloween-cake-fail-as-topper-looks-very-rude.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
