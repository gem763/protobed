The Conservatives are enjoying a modest revival in the opinion polls as former supporters of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party decide that they like what they hear from 10 Downing Street.\n\nNow for the hard part. So far, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron have been polite, but have offered no real prospect of a withdrawal agreement that is much different from Theresa May\u2019s.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nDonald Tusk, the EU president, has been less polite and yesterday he and Mr Johnson engaged in a spat of name-calling, accusing each other of being to blame for a no-deal Brexit if it happens.\n\nAnd this weekend at the G7 summit in Biarritz Mr Johnson is getting to grips with the realities of talking trade with Donald Trump. As we reported yesterday, it seems that the prime minister is beginning to accept that there are serious obstacles to a free-trade deal with the United States.\n\nThe problems are more complicated than the celebrated example of chlorinated chicken. For one thing, any deal has to be haggled line by line through the US congress. It ought to be obvious that the personal friendship between Mr Trump and Mr Johnson is no guarantee of a quick and comprehensive post-Brexit US-UK agreement.\n\nMr Johnson faces a more fundamental problem, however, which is that he has to get Britain out of the EU first. So far the new prime minister has been able to seize the initiative with windy rhetoric and airy assertions.\n\nBut parliament was sitting for only the first full day of his 30 days in the job. When MPs return to Westminster on 3 September, he will be reminded daily that his government, which enjoys with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party a notional majority of just one, is severely constrained.\n\nAnd on any question relating to Brexit, Mr Johnson\u2019s government is unlikely to be able to muster a majority in the House of Commons at all. That means that, if he cannot find a way through to a revised Brexit deal, he is likely to face a parliamentary block on leaving the EU without agreement.\n\nWe are clear what he should do to break that deadlock. He should go back to the people in a new referendum on our relationship with the EU now that the choices are known.\n\nBut we recognise that he is unlikely to choose this way out of his approaching difficulties. It seems more likely that the Brexit question will end up going back to the people in a general election \u2013 an election in which several parties may be proposing a new referendum on the European question.\n\nOne way or another, this is a decision that must return to the people.
