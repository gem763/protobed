Cheney on people questioning the patriotism of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who is testifying before the House today: \"We're talking about decorated veterans who have served this nation \u2026 It is shameful to question their patriotism, their love of this country.\" pic.twitter.com/sEaO1TgOel \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 29, 2019\n\nRelatedly:\n\nROMNEY on attacks on Vindman: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, disgusting, and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.\u201d \u2014 Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) October 29, 2019\n\nEd already flagged one example of a Republican, Sean Duffy, suggesting that Alexander Vindman might have a special \u201caffinity\u201d for Ukraine that renders him a less than reliable witness. Brian Kilmeade echoed the point this morning on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d citing Vindman\u2019s birth in Ukraine (the Soviet Union at the time, Kilmeade reminded viewers) and insisting that he \u201ctends to feel simpatico\u201d with the country.\n\nJohn Yoo appeared to go further than either on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show last night after the news about Vindman\u2019s testimony broke, wondering about \u201cespionage\u201d because Ukrainian officials apparently asked him for advice on how to deal with Rudy Giuliani. This is a guy who\u2019s lived 41 of his 44 years in the United States, joined the U.S. Army, advanced to the rank of colonel, and received the Purple Heart after he was wounded by an IED during a deployment in Iraq. A Twitter pal noted this morning that he\u2019s basically the Trumpian ideal of what a refugee should be apart from the inconvenient fact that he\u2019s made life difficult for Trump, which now requires him to be smeared. There\u2019s nothing alarming about Ukraine asking him about Rudy under the circumstances: Vindman is a member of the National Security Council with expertise involving their country, so go figure that they\u2019d consult a U.S. official with whom they were familiar to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with this Giuliani guy who keeps leaning on us?\u201d\n\nWhether you believe Cheney is speaking from the heart or speaking strategically is a matter of your own estimation of her, but the two options aren\u2019t mutually exclusive. The Cheneys are, of course, famously hawkish and know many veterans; Cheney may feel sincerely indignant on Vindman\u2019s behalf. But I suspect she also sees a disastrous messaging offensive gaining momentum and is rushing to stop it, especially before you-know-who gets behind it. Trump hasn\u2019t insinuated anything about Vindman\u2019s loyalties yet but his is a conspiratorial mind, and he likes to draw blood when he lashes out. The prospect of the commander-in-chief dropping a \u201cdual loyalty\u201d smear on a decorated officer who had a problem with his Ukraine quid pro quo is a real one. And Cheney doubtless knows that that the Matt Gaetzes and Jim Jordans in her caucus will dutifully carry that message forward once the word comes down from on high.\n\nSo here she is doing her best to signal to them, and to Trump, that they should change course. They\u2019re already taking a beating in the media today from anti-Trumpers for Yoo\u2019s and Duffy\u2019s comments. Those two and Kilmeade can be dismissed as irrelevant: They\u2019re not members of Congress, right? But as soon as someone in the House or the Senate starts wondering idly about Vindman\u2019s true allegiance, the \u201cRepublicans smearing veterans\u201d storyline will explode in the press. The GOP is already scrambling as it is to find a productive counter-message while Pelosi and Schiff work through their impeachment process. That one would \u2026 not be productive.\n\nIn fact, Yoo has put out a statement this afternoon emphasizing that he didn\u2019t mean to accuse Vindman of \u201cespionage\u201d on Ingraham\u2019s show last night, rather to suggest that maybe Ukraine was running some sort of espionage operation. Whether that\u2019s true or not, one wonders if Cheney or some other influential Republican dialed him up this morning and told him to help them put out this fire about questioning Vindman\u2019s \u201caffinities\u201d before it spreads.\n\nHere\u2019s some representative commentary on the matter from CNN, the same network that gave Duffy a platform. Lost amid the criticism of questioning Vindman\u2019s patriotism is the fact that his testimony is likely to make life harder for the White House generally and for Gordon Sondland in particular. Sondland, after all, testified earlier that no one ever raised any concerns with him about the administration\u2019s Ukraine policy. Vindman, however, claims in his opening statement that he told Sondland personally that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to bring up Burisma and the 2016 election when the Ukrainians told him how eager they were to meet with Trump. We\u2019ll see if Sondland \u201cclarifies\u201d his testimony after this.", "description": "\"We should not be involved in that process.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/r-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
