Kamala Harris, on the campaign trail for the White House, told a CNN audience that Twitter\u2019s executives ought to boot President Donald Trump because he was using the platform to bully people and not inspire them.\n\nAs if that were Twitter\u2019s standards of use.\n\nBut nothing says U.S. president like a call for censorship of political dissent, right?\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s tweets and his behavior about this [whistleblower] are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,\u201d Harris said, The Hill noted. \u201cIf you look at what he\u2019s been tweeting \u2026 directed at the whistleblower, I frankly think that based on this and all we\u2019ve seen before, including attacking members of Congress, that his Twitter account should be suspended.\u201d\n\nHarris also said that \u201cthere is plenty of evidence to suggest that [Trump] is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people.\u201d\n\nReally?\n\nWell, which is it: Is there plenty of evidence, or is it just a suggestion? Because a fact is hardly the same as a supposition.\n\nBut even without that slip of slippery tongue, Harris makes a ridiculous argument.\n\nTwitter is not in the business to \u201clift people up.\u201d At least, not the conservative people.\n\nRemember this? When Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign team sent around a video of Black Lives Matter Louisville leader Chanelle Helm saying \u201cjust stab the motherf\u2014er in the heart\u201d while referring to a voodoo doll of the majority leader \u2014 it was @Team_Mitch\u2019s account that Twitter locked.\n\nThat was in August.\n\nAnd the Twitter world is filled with examples of similarly biased shows of censorship against conservatives.\n\nWhat Harris wants isn\u2019t so different from what all leftists want \u2014 that is, to silence all opposing political views, particularly those from this bold president.\n\nWhat makes Harris newsworthy, however, is that she\u2019s running for president. She could possibly be the Democratic Party\u2019s pick for 2020, if not for president, then for vice president; if not for vice president, then for some Cabinet position.\n\nAnd if she\u2019s calling for censorship of the president of the United States, simply because she doesn\u2019t like or agree with his political views, imagine how she\u2019d treat Joe Q. Conservative. Imagine a Harris with executive level power.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
