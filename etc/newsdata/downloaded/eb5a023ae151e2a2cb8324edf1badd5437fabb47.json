I don't know how many points they have but they will not play like a team with the points tally they have.\n\nDele Alli scored a late goal to rescue a point for Tottenham against Watford last weekend\n\n'They are a top side in the Premier League and they will be a top side the whole season in the Premier League. We have to respect that and play the best football we can play.'\n\nKlopp could however be without Joel Matip for the visit of Tottenham with the defender considered an injury doubt.\n\nMatip missed Liverpool's midweek Champions League win over Genk due to a recurrence of a knee problem and will require a final check before Sunday's match, although Klopp has no concerns over full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold (illness) and Andy Robertson.\n\nHe added: 'We just rested Robertson after 60 minutes (against Genk). Trent looked fine and there is no setback. I don't know about Joel. Still a bit of time out.'", "description": "Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insisted he is anticipating a difficult encounter when his side take on an out-of-sorts Tottenham team this weekend.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20181042-0-image-a-15_1572010074924.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
