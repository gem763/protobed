Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is \u201cthe most qualified to be president.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has emerged as the clear-cut person to beat,\u201d Soros said of Warren to the New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.\u201d\n\nThe 89-year-old mega Democrat donor stopped short of endorsing Warren, stating his remarks should not be received as such.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anybody because I want to work with whoever,\u201d he stated. \u201cI don\u2019t express my views generally because I have to live with whoever the electorate chooses.\u201d\n\nAs CNBC notes, Soros\u2019s comments come as investors remain \u201cdivided\u201d on Warren, who has proposed a series of tax hikes and frequently criticizes Wall Street.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I\u2019m not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don\u2019t get to buy this process. I won\u2019t back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need,\u201d the Massachusetts senator wrote in a recent tweet.\n\nIn late June, Soros joined Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, philanthropist Agnes Gund, and 15 others in signing a letter endorsing Democrat presidential contenders to create a wealth tax on them \u2014 a move supported by Warren, as well as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke (D-TX).\n\n\u201cAmerica has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more,\u201d the letter, obtained by the Times, read. \u201cA wealth tax could help address the climate crisis, improve the economy, improve health outcomes, fairly create opportunity, and strengthen our democratic freedoms.\u201d\n\nWarren has seen her campaign climb to second place in recent weeks, putting her in striking distance of frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden, according to national polls.", "description": "George Soros declared in a newly-released interview that Sen.
