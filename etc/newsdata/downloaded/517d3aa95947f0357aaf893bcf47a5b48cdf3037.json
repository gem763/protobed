It\u2019s about change. People have to accept that we have to make changes now.\n\n\u2018I have never met Ant and Dec but rest assured if I did, I would be chatting about it. But it\u2019s the programme producers I\u2019d really like to get into a room.\u2019\n\nEmily gets a face full of bugs in a Bushtucker trial last year (Picture: ITV)\n\nRemember when Katie Price had to do this? (Picture: REX/ITV)\n\nThe show came under fire in 2017 when Vanessa White and Jennie McAlpine had to keep animals in their mouths while humming for a Bushtucker trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn ITV spokesman said at the time: \u2018As a production, I\u2019m a Celebrity complies with all regional and national laws concerning the use of insects animals and reptiles.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Springwatch presenter has aired his views about the animal cruelty on show.\n\nEarlier in October, Chris explained that wanted to talk to show bosses about how they include animals in the future, accusing them of \u2018stereotyping\u2019 snakes and cockroaches.\n\nHe told Metro.co.uk: \u2018The time I spend making TV programmes I\u2019m trying to engender an affinity for life. It\u2019s not just about the cute and the cuddly, it\u2019s about everything because everything is necessary. So it\u2019s about snakes it\u2019s about spiders, it\u2019s about cockroaches.\n\n\u2018What I object to on the programme is the ongoing stereotyping of these animals as being things which are dirty, disgusting, poisonous dangerous and so on and so forth. And that\u2019s counterproductive to everything that I do.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t have wild animals in the circus any more, we don\u2019t like animals being used for that sort of entertainment any more. So why would we countenance it on a TV programme?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I plan to write them another letter saying, \u201ccan I come and talk to you, can we come up with a solution whereby your programme is no less entertaining and popular and you don\u2019t stereotype and abuse animals?\u201d.\u2019\n\nHe also publicly blasted the ITV reality show for \u2018abusing animals\u2019 at the TV Choice Awards in September.\n\nI\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026Get Me Out Of Here! returns to ITV in November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
