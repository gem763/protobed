Just like every other day, you drop off your little one at cr\u00e8che, but that afternoon you get a call to come to hospital \u2013 your child is dying.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Martin (26) and Careen Els (27) from Middelburg in Mpumalanga. Their little boy, Ryan (3), who had cerebral palsy, was in the care of Clever Kidz\n\nOn 30 September Careen got a call from the cr\u00e8che saying she needed to rush to Life Midmed Hospital because Ryan was having trouble breathing.\n\n\u201cI was at work,\u201d Martin tells YOU. \u201cOur baby girl was born recently and Careen is home on maternity leave.\n\n\u201cShe was hysterical when she called me, telling me to fetch her \u2013 there\u2019s something wrong with Ryan.\u201d\n\nWhen the couple arrived at the hospital, doctors were struggling to revive an unconscious Ryan.\n\nThe little boy was declared dead after 37 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re unsure what happened,\u201d says Martin, a technician in the mining industry.\n\n\u201cAs we understand it, the kids had finished their lunch and Ryan had been laid down for his nap.\n\n\u201cHe developed breathing problems and the teacher found him blue in the face.\u201d\n\nMartin insists this explanation doesn\u2019t make sense to him.\n\n\u201cThe teacher had apparently gone to put a mattress away. She was gone for only 30 seconds when Ryan stopped breathing.\n\n\u201cI think he must\u2019ve choked on his food.\u201d\n\nThe family are at a loss. \u201cWith a child like Ryan, you sacrifice a lot of your time. Suddenly, that routine is just gone and you have time on your hands you don\u2019t know how to fill.\u201d\n\nAn autopsy and police investigation will determine the cause of Ryan\u2019s death.\n\nSusan du Plessis, headmistress at Clever Kidz, says Ryan\u2019s death has been a great shock to everyone at the school.\n\n\u201cWe were all crazy about him and his teacher is receiving counselling.\n\n\u201cRyan often had spells where he\u2019d stop breathing for a few seconds. There was no vomit on the pillow [where he\u2019d been lying when he stopped breathing].\u201d\n\nShe says the moment they realised Ryan had stopped breathing, one of the teachers performed CPR.\n\n\u201cMy son sped Ryan to hospital but it was too late.\n\n\u201cHis death has shocked us all. He loved his school and we\u2019ll miss him terribly.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s the phone call no parent wants to get.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9509/51ce1e475ff54199b7ede214b58aed05.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
