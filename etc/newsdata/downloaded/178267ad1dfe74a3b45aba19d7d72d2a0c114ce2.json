The 21-year-old Ntilikina helped swing momentum back toward France in the final frame with his full-court pressure on Team USA's guards, plus a surprising dose of offense, including a buzzer-beating dagger with 2:15 left to play.\n\nNtilikina's stat line was modest \u2014 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting, 1 rebound, and 3 assists \u2014 but he was a +22 for the game, the second-best mark of any player on either team.\n\nThe eighth pick in the 2017 draft, Ntilikina is entering a crucial third season with the Knicks. After an up-and-down rookie season in which he showed flashes, but also looked raw in major areas of the game, Ntilikina struggled badly in Year 2 with the Knicks. He lost playing time to other guards, was played out of position, and struggled with injuries down the stretch. The Knicks reportedly listened to trade offers for him at the deadline and before the draft.\n\nThe flashes Ntilikina showed on Wednesday suggest he could turn a corner in Year 3. Ntilikina looks unlikely to ever become a true point guard, but his ball-handling looked improved, his jumper smoother, and his defense \u2014 his NBA calling-card \u2014 aggressive and consistent.\n\nIf Ntilikina can continue to hound opposing guards, shoot at an even league-average clip from distance, and attack close-outs on offense, he'd be a valuable asset in today's NBA.\n\nLeague sources who spoke to Business Insider last season remained fairly high on Ntilikina, though mostly because of his age. Some were wary of how high Ntilikina's ceiling could be. At this stage of his career, Ntilikina doesn't have to become an overnight superstar \u2014 just an above-average role player.\n\nPerformances like Wednesday against the U.S. showed that Ntilikina has the tools to be an impact player. If he can put it all together consistently, he could be at the core of the Knicks' rebuild rather than on the outskirts of it.", "description": "Frank Ntilikina's performance against the U.S. in the FIBA World Cup is the type of game he'll need to consistently produce in a crucial 2019-20 season.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7957512e22af0604260419-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
