Beto O\u2019Rourke speaks at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nGiven his low and static polling, it\u2019s hard to tell what, exactly, Beto O\u2019Rourke hopes to accomplish by staying in the presidential race. But while his actual goal seems a bit elusive, he is increasingly playing a very specific role: the human straw man, the embodiment of every seemingly irrational conservative fear about what the left really wants.\n\nConsider O\u2019Rourke\u2019s appearance at Thursday\u2019s CNN town hall on LGBTQ issues, at which he told moderator Don Lemon that churches and other nonprofits should lose their tax exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage, a position tantamount to declaring war on Catholic parishes and evangelical congregations across the country, not to mention any number of Orthodox Jewish and Muslim groups. Lest you think I\u2019m exaggerating, or leaving out some important nuance, here was his full exchange.\n\nDon Lemon: Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities, should they lose their tax exempt status if they oppose same sex marriage? O\u2019Rourke: Yes. There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone, any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights, that denies the full civil rights, of everyone in America. So as president, we\u2019re going to make that a priority. And we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\n\nAnd the video.\n\n\"Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities, should they lose their tax exempt status if they oppose same sex marriage?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Beto says, without missing a beat. #LGBTQTownHall pic.twitter.com/HJpnyrYfYY \u2014 Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) October 11, 2019\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments drew a warm round of applause in the friendly room, and riled conservatives, who have spent years worrying that Democrats might try to do such a thing. Vlogger Ben Shapiro, to take just one example, suggested that religious conservatives might be forced to move out of the country or \u201cpick up a gun\u201d if the candidate\u2019s plan ever came to pass. Some on the left were also critical; Atlantic writer Adam Serwer called the idea \u201cplainly unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time O\u2019Rourke\u2014a politician, it should be noted, without a constituency: no district, almost no support in the polls\u2014has promised to make conservatives\u2019 worst nightmares come true. After adopting gun control as a marquee issue following the mass shooting in El Paso earlier this year, O\u2019Rourke promised a mandatory gun buyback program for assault weapons, memorably telling a moderator, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d Not long after, Trump and Republicans blamed his comments for making it harder to get a gun control deal done in Congress. (Yes, that\u2019s a bit rich coming from the GOP, but I\u2019ll come back to that).\n\nThese are not the only far-left positions Beto has staked out recently. He\u2019s strongly pro reparations, for instance. But his comments about churches and guns are especially remarkable, in that he\u2019s essentially adopting unpopular stances that Democratic politicians have spent years claiming are unfair caricatures of their actual beliefs. He is turning himself into a walking straw man, the non-fringe guy Republicans can reliably point to when they want to say: \u201cSee, the libs really do want to take your guns and shut down your churches.\u201d\n\nReligious conservatives have worried about the possibility that same-sex marriage could be used as an excuse to strip churches of their tax exemptions for several years now. The fear is rooted in a bit of history: In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that the IRS could revoke Bob Jones University\u2019s nonprofit status over its opposition to interracial dating and marriage. During oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationally, Justice Samuel Alito grilled President Obama\u2019s solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, about whether creating a constitutional right to gay marriage could similarly lead to conservative churches and religious colleges losing their tax-free status. Verrilli said he wasn\u2019t sure, adding that \u201cit\u2019s certainly going to be an issue. I don\u2019t deny that, Justice Alito. It is going to be an issue.\u201d This set off a wave of panic among religious conservative groups, which led Obama\u2019s IRS commissioner to publicly announce that, no, the government would not try to nix anyone\u2019s tax-exemptions over positions on marriage.\n\nNow, O\u2019Rourke has thrown kerosene on the issue all over again, and for what? For many religious institutions, this is a legitimately existential issue\u2014paying property taxes, business income taxes (assuming they do more than break even), and losing the ability to collect tax deductible donations would be a massive financial blow. For LGBTQ rights activists, it would perhaps be a moral victory, but one that would also risk triggering an explosive culture war over faith that could transform gay marriage back into a deeply polarizing topic when it\u2019s been trending in the other direction. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve seen no evidence that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position has much support among a wide swath Democratic voters or leaders. Yet there is now video of a telegenic presidential candidate bringing form to religious conservatives\u2019 worst fears, like some sort of tax-policy Babadook.\n\nAs for guns: It barely needs mentioning that the National Rifle Association\u2019s entire fundraising and political strategy at this point consists of trying to convince its members that Democrats are coming to steal and melt down their rifles. The typical response from Democrats has been to say that, no, they just want some sensible regulations that will prevent needless deaths. As Hillary Clinton put it at the party\u2019s national convention: \u201cI\u2019m not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I\u2019m not here to take away your guns.\u201d While this has not led to any political breakthroughs, it has been effective at shaping public opinion: Gun control measures like background checks and limits on assault rifles are extremely popular. Mandatory gun buybacks, on the other hand, are not.\n\nOf course, the most ardent gun-control opponents have always assumed that Democrats are lying about all this and are secretly plotting mass gun confiscation. Some point back to a 1995 video in which Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that, if she could have rounded up 51 votes to ban all assault rifles, she would have. (They also badly misconstrue that moment as her saying she wanted to ban all guns). But I humbly submit that having a fresh video of Beto O\u2019Rourke saying \u201chell yeah\u201d refreshes their message a bit.\n\nThe thing about all of this is that, politically, it is deeply unhelpful. I would personally argue that stripping churches of their tax-exempt status is a horrible idea on the merits for a long lists of reasons it would take a whole second article to spell out. (Short version: Racial segregation has a unique and monstrous history in the U.S. that has required the government to take active measures to stamp out, a la Bob Jones, but generally speaking, the government absolutely should not be in the business of siding with one religious belief system over another, which would create a troubling precedent a conservative administration might turn against other minorities, such as Muslims one day.) I would, however, be perfectly comfortable with a mandatory buyback program. But neither is going to happen any time in the foreseeable future, and if anything, talking about them makes it harder to make actual progress on issues of gay rights and guns by activating conservatives\u2019 fears about slippery slopes.\n\nDo I think that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments about AR-15s single-handedly made a gun deal that much harder in Congress, as some GOP senators have claimed? No\u2014and for what it\u2019s worth, Trump has lately been using impeachment as a reason to avoid negotiations. But do I think his mouthing off took a bit heat off Republicans by giving them an excuse not to engage? That by making himself a convenient figure on which Republicans can hang bad faith attacks about Democrats\u2019 intentions, he has hurt the causes he\u2019s supposed to be fighting for? Yes, I do. That\u2019s what straw men are good for, after all.\n\nUpdate, Oct. 12, 7:55 AM:\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign\u2019s rapid response director, Lauren Hitt, has sent me a statement attempting to clarify the candidate\u2019s comments from Thursday: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of confusion about Beto\u2019s position on tax exempt status for religious institutions. In short, he would support revoking the tax exempt status for a religious institution that fired an employee or refused to hire someone b/c they were in a same-sex marriage. He would not, however, revoke tax-exempt status for a religious organization he simply disagree [sic] with.\u201d This would still be a somewhat controversial position that would open up questions about the rights of churches. But if O\u2019Rourke really was only talking about specific instances of employment discrimination, perhaps it would have been smart to say so on stage.", "description": "Why is the candidate with no constituency giving voice to conservatives' worst fears?", "authors": ["Jordan Weissmann"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/e20c0855-7899-4da0-a7a9-1c368b8f63da.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=4487x2991&offset=0x75", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
