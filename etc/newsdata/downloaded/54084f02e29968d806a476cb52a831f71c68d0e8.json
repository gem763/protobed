Revolutions are typically staged by small slices of populations, and it takes even smaller ones to perpetrate political violence, like the mass shooting in El Paso last month.\n\nAnd in the age of social media, it takes only a few to maul the many. \u201cYou can tell me that 70 percent of Americans don\u2019t participate in the culture war, but it doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d said Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at N.Y.U. \u201cEvents today are driven by small numbers that can shame and intimidate large numbers. Social media has changed the dynamic. Even if most Americans practice excellent fire safety habits, if a small minority is rewarded for throwing lit matches, we\u2019re going to live in an age of arson.\u201d\n\nEven so, a singular focus on division risks misunderstanding American society.\n\nImage The City Hall clock tower in Scranton, Pa.

In 2016, Mr. Trump improved over Mitt Romney\u2019s margin by a combined 24 points in Lackawanna County and neighboring Luzerne County. The two places had the second- and third-largest swings toward the president of any county with more than 100,000 voters. Mr. Trump\u2019s net 55,000-vote surge here was enough to cover his 44,000-vote victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nYet in Lackawanna County last month, 12 of the 30 people interviewed described themselves as not engaged in politics at all. Mr. Ahmed says he occasionally sees news, like when a celebrity shares something on Instagram. Most recently it was \u201csomething about the Everglades being on fire.\u201d But it fades quickly.\n\n\u201cYou see it, then you go back to your own problems,\u201d he said.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t vote. He went to the polls for Hillary Clinton in 2016, not because he liked her but because his grandmother and aunt pushed him to go.\n\nAlmost every measure of polarization suggests that a majority of the public has not succumbed to the growing animosity between the parties. According to Pew, the share of Americans on the more rigid, ideological edges of the electorate was about 26 percent in 2017.", "description": "Political institutions may be more divided than they\u2019ve been in a century and a half, but how divided are Americans themselves?", "authors": ["Sabrina Tavernise", "Nate Cohn"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/world/24up-polarize-scranton-promo1/24up-polarize-scranton-promo1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
