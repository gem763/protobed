Still, it\u2019s common for many companies to use \u201cAI\u201d as a simple buzzword. But it would be a mistake to think that AI is just jargon though.\n\nAt this point, the power of artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. As such, look for AI-driven technologies to make a massive impact over the next decade. That will, of course, have a major effect on the stock market. Right now, many tech investors are primarily focused on cloud and software-as-a-service stocks. And with good reason \u2014 those have been booming.\n\nBut with all the data accumulating online, it\u2019s only a matter of time until more powerful AI turns that data into new understanding \u2014 and new profits. Here\u2019s seven stocks to harness the power of artificial intelligence in your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is far from a pure play on artificial intelligence. The company still pays the bills with search advertising, after all. And its dominant Android operating system will continue reaping rewards for Alphabet for many years to come.\n\nThat said, if you want a company that undoubtedly will be a major part of artificial intelligence in coming years, look no further. Google launched Google AI in 2017 as a separate entity to show the importance of AI to the company\u2019s future.\n\nAlready, Alphabet has made moves with DeepMind, its roughly 700-employee division that has achieved things such as beating humans at the board game Go. Recently, Alphabet\u2019s artificial intelligence topped humans in deciphering ancient Greek text. Turning to more practical matters, Google is using AI to help customers solve important \u2014 although perhaps mundane \u2013tasks such as filling in online forms automatically or responding better and faster to voice-inputted questions.\n\nAll this plays back into Alphabet\u2019s core products, as well. The better Google Search is, for example, the more advertising revenue Google will be able to bring in. Artificial intelligence is at the core of GOOGL stock, and its further advances in the field should help power profits across the company\u2019s other lines of business.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM)\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) isn\u2019t having a great year. It\u2019s not had a great past five years in fact. IBM\u2019s stock price has stagnated as the company has struggled to adapt to a changing tech market. The company\u2019s huge Red Hat acquisition will be critical in trying to get its cloud division going again.\n\nThat said, while IBM has had its struggles, you can\u2019t deny its excellent positioning in AI. IBM\u2019s Watson is one of the most exciting applications. Not only does it have its high-profile appearances, such as competing in game shows and chess matches, it is also being used for chat applications, healthcare, weather prediction and assisting teachers.\n\nAs Watson is able to answer questions in natural language, the range of potential uses is immense. And IBM is constantly upgrading Watson\u2019s capabilities. Just this week, it added new functionality to Watson Assist, Watson Discovery and a \u201cdrift\u201d function that can show when the AI\u2019s prediction is moving away from actual real world results.", "description": "Artificial intelligence has slowly moved from a science fiction topic to something that has a huge impact on people's livelihoods and the world around us.
