Mayor Eric Garcetti, told Fox News.\n\n\u201cOur office learned very recently of the administration\u2019s plans to visit L.A., to learn more about our strategies for responding to the homelessness crisis,\u201d Comisar said in an email. \u201cWe welcome them and look forward to showing them our work to confront this humanitarian emergency.\u201d\n\nLA PUSH TO DEVELOP SKID ROW PROMPTS NEW CLASHES IN CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS CRISIS\n\nThe news of the trip, first reported by The Washington Post, comes amid renewed criticism from the president of officials' response to California's homelessness epidemic. Los Angeles has seen a 16 percent increase in its homeless population over last year \u2013 more than 36,000 people live on the streets -- according to a recent report.\n\n\"What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country,\" Trump said during a rally in Ohio last month. \"It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible conditions. Look at San Francisco, look at some of your other cities.\"\n\nAmong the topics being discussed this week are ideas for razing the state\u2019s existing homeless encampments; building new homeless shelters and housing or refurbishing existing units while giving the federal government more oversight of health care and housing; and addressing the homeless population in Los Angeles\u2019 \u201cSkid Row\u201d area.\n\nWhile officials say that no concrete plans have been made by officials in conjunction with the administration, state and local lawmakers have recently pushed a number of initiatives.\n\nLA RESIDENTS FED UP WITH OFFICIALS, DEMAND CHANGE AFTER HOMELESS CRISIS SPIRALS IN CITY\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on a $214.8 billion budget in June, authorizing $2.4 billion in spending to address the state's housing and homelessness crisis. The budget allocates $650 million to local governments to build shelters, offer rental assistance and convert hotels and motels to temporary or permanent housing.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Garcetti has prioritized Skid Row in his plan to tackle homelessness and is allocating $7 million from the $124 million the state recently approved for improving the health and safety of city residents. The city already spent $20 million last year to expand hygiene infrastructure and street cleanups in the community.\n\nBesides the hygiene initiative, the city has plans to build a bin facility for Skid Row residents to store their belongings, start a cleaning initiative that would hire residents to clean the streets, and construct crisis beds for women in Skid Row at Downtown Women\u2019s Center.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe visit by White House officials comes as lawmakers in Los Angeles debate a plan barring people from sleeping and camping on streets and sidewalks in more than a quarter of the city. The plan, which could be taken up by the City Council as early as Wednesday, would add to existing rules that put about 15 percent of Los Angeles \u2013 mainly its city parks - off-limits at night.\n\nIf approved, the plan will almost certainly face numerous legal challenges after a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling from last year found that prosecuting homeless people for sleeping on public property when they have no access to a shelter represented constitutionally prohibited cruel and unusual punishment. But local politicians argue that something needs to be done as they search for a way to build permanent housing for the thousands of homeless people living on the city\u2019s streets.\n\n\u201cWe need to enforce this plan so that it incentivizes neighborhoods to say yes to building shelters,\u201d Branimir Kvartuc, a spokesperson for City Councilman Joe Buscaino, told Fox News.", "description": "President Trump has dispatched a team to California to see what the federal government can do to crack down on the state\u2019s escalating\u00a0homelessness crisis, Fox News has confirmed.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/AP19170836290784.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
