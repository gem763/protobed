If the fire goes through quickly and just singes their fur, they are fine the fur will grow back,\" she said.\n\nBut if the fire intensifies and continues to burn up the tree \"they'll perish\", she added.\n\n\"So we won't really know until we get in there and start to look.\"\n\nLast year, a World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia report said there were probably fewer than 20,000 koalas left in New South Wales and they risked becoming extinct in the state as early as 2050, largely because of \"excessive tree-clearing for farming\".\n\nThe Australian Koala Foundation estimates there may only be between 43,000 and 100,000 koalas left in the wild across Australia. It argues the classification should be raised to \"critically endangered\".\n\nKoalas were thought to number in excess of 10 million before British settlers arrived in 1788.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Fires believed to have been sparked by lightning lay waste to more than 2,000 hectares in northern New South Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/383715dacd9d4d61b99c354f5ed2c4e8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
