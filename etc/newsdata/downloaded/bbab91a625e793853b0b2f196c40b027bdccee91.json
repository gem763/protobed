Biden Jr. delivers a speech at the Small Grand Things event center in West Point, Iowa. WEST POINT, Iowa \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. was making an impassioned case for protecting undocumented immigrants one recent Sunday when he abruptly stopped himself.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s many more things, but \u2014\u201d he said before trailing off at a union forum.\n\nMinutes later, Mr. Biden interrupted himself again.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a, there\u2019s \u2014 my time up?\u201d he said, echoing a line he had used when he stumbled in the first presidential debate this year. \u201cI guess not. I guess it is.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the 2019 Second Step Presidential Justice Forum at Benedict College in Columbia, South Carolina, U.S. October 26, 2019. REUTERS/Sam Wolfe\n\nAnd as he spoke to reporters here last week about President Trump\u2019s freezing of military aid to Ukraine, he briefly fumbled his words.\n\n\u201cPeople are being killed in western, in eastern Afghan \u2014 excuse me, in eastern, uh, Ukraine,\u201d he said.\n\nSix months into his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden is still delivering uneven performances on the debate stage and on the campaign trail in ways that can undermine his message. He takes circuitous routes to the ends of sentences, if he finishes them at all. He sometimes says the opposite of what he means (\u201cI would eliminate the capital gains tax \u2014 I would raise the capital gains tax\u201d he said in this month\u2019s debate). He has mixed up countries, cities and dates, embarked on off-message asides and sometimes he simply cuts himself off.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign event, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019, in Scranton, Pa. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThat choppy speaking style puts Mr. Biden at a disadvantage as his front-runner status erodes and he confronts growing pressure to expand his appeal with voters and donors. He faces intensifying competition for moderate support, a formidable liberal foe in Elizabeth Warren, attacks on his family by Mr. Trump and Republicans, and a troubling cash crunch.\n\nAt a time when he most needs to convey confidence and forcefulness, some Democrats say, he is instead getting in his own way.\n\n\u201cHe does not do well speaking where he isn\u2019t giving a speech,\u201d said Chris Henning, the Democratic chair in Greene County, Iowa, who caucused for Mr. Biden when he ran for president in 2008. \u201cHe\u2019s not good in debates and he comes across like he\u2019s stumbling around, trying to figure out what he\u2019s going to say.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, speaks during an interview on Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019, in Florence, S.C. (AP Photo/Sarah Blake Morgan)\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s verbal miscues have long led to challenges. He was forced to withdraw from the 1988 presidential campaign after he presented biographical details from the life of the British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock as his own. His gaffe-prone tendencies made national headlines during his 2008 presidential bid when he referred to Barack Obama as \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Biden can now appear less crisp, and more hesitant, than in the past \u2014 and also in comparison to more polished rivals in the crowded Democratic primary. As the early leader in 2020 polls he has spent more time in the national spotlight, and he is competing in a fast-moving social media environment in which gaffes are magnified and candidates are rewarded for being quick on their feet.\n\n\u00a9 Jordan Gale for The New York Times An audience member listens as Mr. Biden speaks in West Point, Iowa.\n\nMr. Biden, 76, still leads many national polls, and he enjoys significant good will from many Democratic voters. Some attendees at his events in Iowa last week said Mr. Biden, who overcame a childhood stutter, is a relatable raconteur whose decades of experience are comforting amid the chaos of the Trump era. He can be forceful in denouncing the president from the podium, and is at his best in individual conversations with voters.\n\nAnd of course, if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, he will face a president who is an undisciplined speaker in his own right \u2014 one who misstated the name of his own cabinet secretary recently, tortures grammar and spelling in his tweets and, most significantly, routinely makes false claims about matters large and small.\n\nBut Mr. Biden\u2019s inconsistent performances illustrate why many Democrats remain skeptical of his candidacy: Whatever his strengths in polls \u2014 and the data is mixed, especially in the early-voting primary states \u2014 on the ground his performances are often plainly shaky.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S. October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Mark Makela\n\nNowhere are the stakes higher for Mr. Biden than in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state where Mr. Biden will return for a four-day swing on Wednesday. Ms. Warren has tied or moved ahead of Mr. Biden in some polls, and party officials on the ground say Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., appears capable of siphoning some of Mr. Biden\u2019s centrist support. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a moderate from neighboring Minnesota, also gained attention after the October debate. Last week, she qualified for the fifth debate, scheduled for next month.\n\nWhile Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has publicly sought to downplay expectations in Iowa, it has also invested heavily in both time and resources. In a confidential memo circulated last week, the campaign manager, Greg Schultz, said that Mr. Biden was positioned to have a \u201cnarrow advantage\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cI plan on winning Iowa. I\u2019m working like hell to win Iowa,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters here, adding, \u201cIt could end up being a must-win; it could not make a difference.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden speaks to supporters at Hillside High School in Durham, N.C. on Sunday, Oct 27, 2019.

At the September debate, Mr. Biden responded to a question about the legacy of slavery with a rambling answer that included advising the use of a record player to expose underprivileged children to more words. At a CNN forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues this month, Mr. Biden \u2014 who was ahead of Mr. Obama in voicing support for same-sex marriage \u2014 still raised eyebrows for referencing \u201cgay bath houses,\u201d while making a broader point about evolving attitudes.\n\nGallery: The candidates for the 2020 presidential campaign (USA Today)\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily bother me,\u201d said Steve Drahozal, the Democratic chairman in Dubuque County, Iowa, of Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201chalting speaking style,\u201d allowing that Mr. Biden might simply be thoughtful. \u201cBut there are a lot of voters out there who want to be inspired by a candidate. Democrats win when we have an inspiring candidate.\u201d\n\nConcerns about Mr. Biden\u2019s style aren\u2019t confined to members of the political class: Voters often raise the issue, including at his own events.\n\n\u201cI like Joe, but I don\u2019t think Joe\u2019s going to get it because he has not been doing very well with his speaking, with the debates,\u201d said Lisa Kane, 62, of Keokuk, Iowa, as she waited for Mr. Biden to speak. \u201cPete would do a better job. He\u2019s younger, a great speaker, he\u2019s smart, got the military background.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden greets local residents during a community event, Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2019, in Davenport, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nDebbie Hunter, who stood with Ms. Kane, based her assessment on Mr. Biden\u2019s debate performances, which many Democrats continue to see as lackluster at best.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s real hard to follow,\u201d Ms. Hunter, 57, said. \u201cI have a lot of concern about his ability to concentrate, his attention span, the ability to get the job done.\u201d\n\nBut Patty Madden, 69, and Bev Alderson, 60, two former teachers, said Mr. Biden\u2019s informal, story-laden speaking style was part of his charm.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Ms. Alderson said. \u201cIt appeals to the common people, working class, Americans, everybody!\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images SCRANTON, PA - OCTOBER 23: Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden gets a hug from a supporter after he laid out his economic policy plan to help rebuild the middle class during a campaign stop at the Scranton Cultural Center on October 23, 2019 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

(Photo by Rick Loomis/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI know he falls over some of his words, we all do,\u201d Ms. Madden said.\n\n\u201cOh, big deal!\u201d Ms. Alderson interjected. \u201cHe speaks from his heart.\u201d\n\nAt his two events in Iowa last Wednesday, Mr. Biden spoke, relatively carefully, from teleprompters. There were some apparent tangents \u2014 one promise to wrap up his address drifted into a digression on illness in China \u2014 but he also ended with a forceful conclusion about America\u2019s strengths and received a standing ovation.\n\nMr. Biden has also proven capable of speaking crisply and movingly, and he was a fierce competitor at the vice-presidential debate in 2012.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the 2019 Democratic women's leadership forum, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nThis year, too, he has had some electric moments, such as when he eviscerated Mr. Trump for fanning \u201cthe flames of white supremacy.\u201d And he can be sharper in exchanges with reporters than he is on a debate stage.\n\n\u201cHis day after debate press conference have been outstanding,\u201d Jim Messina, Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, wrote in an email. \u201cHe shines in that format, as he did in 2012. It also shows he still had a fastball. The mass format debates just aren\u2019t his strong suit. And that\u2019s probably O.K. The field is beginning to narrow. He still has time.\u201d\n\nSome advisers and allies have said privately that they have little control over Mr. Biden\u2019s speaking style, but they also insist his debate performances have improved, and note that a string of controversies and wobbly public appearances have hardly crushed his campaign.\n\n\u00a9 Catalyst Images A worker smooths the surface of a United States flag ahead of a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019, in Scranton, Pa. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\n\u201cNot one expert has been right about Joe Biden,\u201d said former Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and friend of Mr. Biden\u2019s. \u201cIt goes on and on. \u2018He can\u2019t make it, it\u2019s just the name ID.\u2019 Then he\u2019s going to fall out because he\u2019s too affectionate. Now he\u2019s going to fall down because he\u2019s too gaffe prone? Now it\u2019s the money? I just don\u2019t buy it.\u201d\n\nIn response to multiple questions for this article, a Biden campaign spokesman, Jamal Brown, pointed to steady poll numbers in head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump, and to surveys that show him growing his support among Democratic voters.\n\nMs. Hunter, of Keokuk, said seeing Mr. Biden in person allayed some of her concerns and that she had moved him in her candidate rankings.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to win these debates, he needs to speak up, get fired up,\u201d she said. Asked if he had done so in the event at West Point, she replied, \u201cWell, a little. At the end.\u201d\n\nShane Goldmacher contributed reporting.\n\nMORE IN DEPTH:\n\nThree big questions that follow the death of ISIS leader Baghdadi (The Washington Post)", "description": "Biden Needs to Deliver His Message.
