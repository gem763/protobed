Those purposes might include launching this preemptive strike as a way of distracting public attention from a report expected soon from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz concerning misconduct allegations in the investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign. The report might well find that the FBI abused its powers by running counterintelligence operations against U.S. citizens and shattering the norm of law enforcement staying far away from choosing sides during a political campaign.\n\nBut if you are a rule-of-law conservative, especially one with great faith in the Constitution\u2019s durability, you will have staunchly defended Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s appointment as special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s election-meddling, pursuant to Justice Department regulations. You might have been shocked by the strange and distorting effects that partisanship clearly had on the special counsel\u2019s team, but you\u2019d still be an institutionalist, still confident in the rule of law.\n\nNow come two events. The first is the publication of Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley A. Strassel\u2019s new, thoroughly persuasive book \u201cResistance (At All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America.\u201d The second is the rush to turn an insignificant phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into an impeachable offense. Read the rough transcript. The hysteria is risible.\n\nAs Strassel writes, the rule of law has been undermined over the past several years by deeply compromised senior officials in the intelligence and law enforcement communities, along with allies in the Obama White House during the period between 2015 and 2017. The long, drawn-out Mueller investigation added to the miasma of false narratives about the president. Now add to that brew both the manifest partisanship of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the domination of news coverage by elite-media liberals and their #NeverTrump allies-of-convenience (pretending to a conservatism that exists independent of long-held constitutional norms), and any fair-minded political observer and proponent of constitutional order should be on high alert.\n\nMost of us in the group of \u201csometimes Trumpers\u201d have long records of criticizing the president on a host of issues, most recently the failure \u2014 twice \u2014 to respond to Iran\u2019s aggression with military strikes that would restore deterrence. Our most frequent criticisms target the way Trump brawls without reserve. We don\u2019t believe that the media is \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d We don\u2019t believe that dubious \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d or even partisan extremists are guilty of treason. We reject most of the president\u2019s non-China tariffs, and we wish his criticism of NATO allies was balanced with applause for what they do right. We would prefer a much less confrontational, much more upbeat stream of rhetoric from the president, such as in the speeches he delivered in Saudi Arabia, Poland and in France on the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings.\n\nBut we know as well that Trump has put scores of originalists on the federal bench who will defend the Constitution. We know that he has poured money into a depleted U.S. military. We know that his \u201cAmerica first\u201d rhetoric, far from being exclusionary, is confident, purpose-driven and appropriate. We think the 2020 election will be about policy choices and temperament \u2014 and it will be another starkly binary choice.\n\nThose of us who have tried to observe, write and comment from the no man\u2019s land of the raging political battle cannot have failed to perceive a sinister turn of events as the House moved toward staging an impeachment show trial. The feeling of an illegitimate attempt at a coup dressed in constitutional clothing marks this latest turn as it never did the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nSunday, on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d historian Doris Kearns Goodwin noted that the House would be judged by how it conducts itself. I pointed out soon thereafter that Schiff had already failed that test, going full Queen of Hearts from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland,\u201d who did not need due process of any sort before wanting heads to roll.\n\nFair-minded observers will look back at the past three-plus years and conclude not that there is a so-called deep state \u2014 there isn\u2019t \u2014 but that there are many compromised people desperately trying to maneuver their way out of a huge legal and ethical corner they put themselves into. Do not trust the always-hate-Trump pundits. Do not trust the Trump-does-no-wrong pundits. Trust the people doing the hard work of putting together the puzzle of the past three years while at the same time keeping a cool, precise eye on the president\u2019s conduct.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many in that category. Follow them closely.", "description": "Don\u2019t trust the always-hate-Trump pundits.
