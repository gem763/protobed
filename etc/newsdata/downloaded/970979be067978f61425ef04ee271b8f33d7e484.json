There \u201cwas a high degree of interest\u201d to do similar meetings in the future and continue the joint coordination that began last year to prepare for the midterms, the person said.\n\nFor social-media companies, the stakes are high nearly three years after Russian agents took to Facebook, Google and Twitter to spread propaganda and stoke social and political unrest during the 2016 election. In response, each of the tech companies has improved their digital defenses, honing their tools to spot and remove harmful content \u2014 but the threats have intensified as well, becoming more sophisticated and global.\n\nIn recent months, for example, Facebook, Google and Twitter had to contend with the spread of viral, manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. They\u2019ve also taken action against disinformation campaigns launched by Iran targeting the United States. And they recently disabled a network of coordinated inauthentic activity tied to China, focused on the protests in Hong Kong, marking the first time Beijing had ever been accused of such efforts online.\n\nAdding to the challenge, one of President Trump\u2019s campaign surrogates on Monday promoted a popular conspiracy theory on Twitter that falsely tied Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democratic contender for the White House in 2020, to the shootings in Odessa, Texas, that left seven dead and 22 wounded. It prompted a sharp rebuke from O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager, who said Facebook, Google and Twitter should take more responsibility \u2014 and not leave it to \u201cthe victims of misinformation attacks\u201d to handle the problem.", "description": "Federal law enforcement officials huddled Wednesday with Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter on Wednesday to discuss election security ahead of the 2020 presidential race, according to several U.S. and industry officials, responding to heightened concerns that social-media sites are still struggling to stop the spread of disinformation online.", "authors": ["Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "September At Pm", "Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post.
