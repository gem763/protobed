The senators described the social media activities of the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency in 2016 as part of a \u201cbroader, sophisticated, and ongoing information warfare campaign designed to sow discord in American politics and society.\u201d\n\nThe senators noted the Russians\u2019 social media effort was a \u201cvastly more complex and strategic assault on the United States than was initially understood,\u201d with planning underway in 2014 when two Internet Research Agency operatives were sent to the U.S. to gather intelligence.\n\nWhile a previous assessment indicated the Russian activities aspired to help then-candidate Trump when possible, the Senate report went further and said the Russians\u2019 social media campaign was \u201covertly and almost invariably supportive\u201d of Trump and designed to harm Democrat Hillary Clinton. Also targeted by Russian social media efforts were Trump\u2019s Republican opponents \u2014 Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nTrump has been largely dismissive of Russian activities in 2016 and now faces an impeachment inquiry into whether he inappropriately solicited foreign election help from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 vote. White House spokesman Judd Deere said the Trump administration has made election security a priority.\n\n\u201cThe Federal government has invested in essential programs and is proactively partnering with states to improve protection of election infrastructure and to elevate threat awareness through improved information sharing and exercises,\u201d Deere said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report concluded the Russian activities were focused largely on socially divisive issues, such as race, immigration and guns, in \u201can attempt to pit Americans against one another and against their government.\u201d It found Russian efforts targeted black Americans more than any other group and the overall activity increased rather than decreased after Election Day in 2016.\n\n\u201cRussia is waging an information warfare campaign against the U.S. that didn\u2019t start and didn\u2019t end with the 2016 election,\u201d said North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel. \u201cBy flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nThe senators warned that Russia is not the only one posing a threat to U.S. elections, pointing to China, North Korea and Iran. The nation\u2019s intelligence chiefs have warned about the threat of foreign interference in the upcoming 2020 election.\n\n\u201cThe Russian playbook is out in the open for other foreign and domestic adversaries to expand upon - and their techniques will only get more sophisticated,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the panel\u2019s top Democrat.\n\nThe report detailed efforts by the Russians to exploit tensions in American society, particularly along racial lines. For instance, over 66 percent of the Internet Research Agency\u2019s Facebook ads contained a term related to race and its Facebook pages were targeted to black Americans in key metropolitan areas.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat running for president, highlighted parts of the report on Twitter and urged lawmakers to take action to prevent future interference.\n\n\u201cI think of America as a family\u2014 and like any family, we have issues. We have a history of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation that we need to confront,\u201d Harris wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut someone came into our house and inflamed these tensions to turn us against each other. We can\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d\n\nIn the report, the Senate Intelligence Committee recommends that the Trump administration \u201cpublicly reinforce\u201d the danger of attempts by hostile nations to interfere in the 2020 election. It also calls for the administration to develop a framework for deterring future attacks and to create an interagency task force to monitor the use of social media by foreign governments for interference.\n\nSenators also recommended social media companies improve coordination and cooperation with relevant government agencies. In addition, they said, Congress should consider legislation to ensure the public knows the source behind online political ads.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Democrats unveiled an election security bill that would require more transparency in online political ads along with tightening laws around the exchange of campaign information between candidates and foreign governments and requiring that campaigns report illicit offers of foreign help to the FBI.\n\nThe House bill would require TV stations, cable and satellite providers and social media companies such as Facebook to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to ensure political advertising is not purchased by people outside of the U.S., either directly or indirectly, in part by requiring that the customer provide a valid U.S. address.\n\nThis summer, Facebook announced it would be tightening its rules around political ads and requiring those who want to run ads pertaining to elections, politics or major social issues to confirm their identity and prove they are in the U.S. with a tax identification number or other government ID.\n\nA separate House election security measure passed the House at the beginning of the year, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has declined to take it up. McConnell, however, has supported an effort to send $250 million in additional election security funds to states to shore up their systems ahead of 2020.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report makes it crystal clear to everyone that Vladimir Putin exploited social media to spread false information in the 2016 elections and that the Senate must take action to ensure Americans know who is behind online political ads to help prevent it from happening again,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nAn earlier report by the committee focused on efforts by the Russians to target state and local election systems.", "description": "Lawmakers call on Trump administration to create an emergency task force on foreign election interference.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE629_Putin_ZG_20180301064726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
