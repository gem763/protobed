If they don\u2019t like it then I\u2019ll do a pack up.\n\n\"And all these comments about my brows and not one person has offered to microblade them for me.\n\n\"I'm one to say it how it is, I don\u2019t stand and scream and shout, it comes out exactly as it is, I said you're not feeding my child, and I'm not happy, that's it.\n\n\"Anyway he's gone back to school like nowt's happened.\"\n\n(Image: HullLive/WS)\n\nMiss Jarvis said she decided to send Jayden back to school because she didn't want to face a fine.\n\nShe said: \"The education teacher from the school rang me on Thursday to ask why Jayden is not at school but said 'obviously I know why he's not at school'. To be honest she is lovely.\n\n\"She said to me I will get a big fine. That\u2019s down to me as a parent to deal with.\n\n\"She said she thinks it's in Jayden's best interests to come back into school, so I said 'yes I do think that too, but only if he will be fed'. She agreed with that. I said 'I\u2019ll think about it'.\"\n\nMiss Jarvis is a stay-at-home mum and her children are entitled to free school meals.\n\nWhen she took Jayden back to school he had a packed lunch with him, a weekly ritual because he does not like the fried fish which is served every Friday.\n\nShe claims the head teacher called her later to discuss the incident.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nShe said: \"She went 'Hi, how can I help you?'\n\n\"So I said 'the whole situation', so she said she thought it had been resolved and I was like 'no, we haven't spoke for it to be solved'.\n\n\"She said 'I can see that Jayden is back', so I said 'yes but he was upset'. So she said 'I can assure you it will never happen again, if there ever is an issue like this again we will give you a call'.\n\n\"But that's all I asked her to do in the first place. That is exactly what I asked for, not to be told that he\u2019s had no lunch all day.\n\n\"It\u2019s a situation that could have been resolved on that Wednesday afternoon if she had just said that.\"\n\nMiss Jarvis, also mum to Alisha, seven, and Cole, five, said no-one from the school apologised.\n\nShe added: \"I think that they\u2019ve done wrong and its taken them a while to admit they\u2019ve done wrong and I don\u2019t think my bain is the only bain that has been there.\n\n\"I saw an old dinner lady had put something on [ Facebook ] saying 'I used to work here and there's not enough meals for the children' - so how long has this been going on?\n\n\"I'm not alone and I know I'm not alone because a few people have private messaged me and said they have gone through the same but they didn\u2019t dare speak out.\n\n\"I\u2019m hoping now Thanet won't do it to another child at that school.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Thanet Primary School said: \"We expect all of our pupils to attend school on a regular basis to make sure they have the best possible chance to achieve.\n\n\u201cA good record of attendance impacts upon successful further education and good career prospects, and we want to ensure that every pupil has a chance to achieve this.\u201d", "description": "Stacy Jarvis, 31, says her son Jayden, nine, missed out on a hot lunch because he \"took his time in the toilet\"", "authors": ["Joanna Lovell", "Image", "Hulllive Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549732.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_East-Hull-mum-pulls-son-out-of-school-after-row-with-head-teacher-over-a-tuna-sandwichJayden-Hunter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
