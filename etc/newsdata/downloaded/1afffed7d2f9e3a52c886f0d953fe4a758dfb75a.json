After many months of trying to resolve the pay dispute, we are extremely sorry that it has come to this.\"\n\nSeeking bigger share of profits\n\nBA says it has offered pilots a pay rise of 11.5 per cent over three years but the union says its members want a bigger share of the company's profits.\n\nThe union accuses BA of making massive profits at the expense of workers who made sacrifices during hard times. A further strike is penciled in for Sept. 27.\n\nUnion leader Brian Strutton said pilots are determined to be heard.\n\nPilots at British Airways on Monday launched a 48-hour strike over pay. The move forced the cancellation of most of the airline's flights. (Hannah McKay/Reuters)\n\n\"They've previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\"\n\nBA operates up to 850 flights a day. The company said it understands the frustration of passengers affected by the strike.\n\nLondon's sprawling Heathrow Airport will be the most impacted by the work stoppage as it is BA's major hub and used for many of the company's long-haul international flights.", "description": "British Airways says it has cancelled almost all of its flights due to a 48-hour strike called by its pilots union over wage issues.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275702.1568020383!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/iag-british-airways-strikes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
