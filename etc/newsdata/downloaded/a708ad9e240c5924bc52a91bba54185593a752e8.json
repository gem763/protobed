He was apparently referring, at least in part, to unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about a purported Ukrainian link to Russia\u2019s hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters in the White House briefing room.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past the corruption that related to the DNC server? Absolutely, no question about that,\u201d Mulvaney continued. \u201cBut that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nAsked about mixing politics with foreign policy, Mulvaney replied: \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy \u2026 I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d\n\nMulvaney\u2019s statement contradicted Trump\u2019s repeated denials that his administration had made military aid to Ukraine contingent upon Kyiv\u2019s willingness to open an investigation into the debunked DNC theory and the dealings of Hunter Biden in Ukraine.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Jay Sekulow issued a pointed statement shortly after, distancing the president\u2019s legal team from Mulvaney\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing,\u201d it said.\n\nTrump, traveling in Texas, appeared to stand by his top aide, calling Mulvaney a \u201cgood man\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of confidence\u201d in him, Trump said.\n\nMulvaney himself later claimed in a statement that his comments had been misconstrued.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\n\n\u201cThe only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d\n\nAdam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill that Mulvaney\u2019s remarks made the impeachment situation \u201cmuch, much worse\u201d.\n\nSchiff would not comment on whether he would bring Mulvaney in for a deposition, but the House committees investigating impeachment have already requested documents from the acting White House chief of staff.\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell, a member of the House intelligence committee, said Mulvaney \u201cco-signed the president\u2019s confession\u201d.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s comments were just one of several major developments in Washington on Thursday. Shortly after the press briefing, news broke that the energy secretary, Rick Perry, whose involvement in the Ukraine phone call has come under scrutiny, had informed Trump that he was resigning.\n\nThough Perry\u2019s resignation was long expected, the news of his involvement with Ukraine likely added pressure to the decision. Perry told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he spoke to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani at Trump\u2019s direction about Ukraine-related matters.\n\nTrump told reporters he has a replacement for Perry lined up.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the US ambassador to the European Union testified before Congress. Gordon Sondland said Trump had instructed US diplomats to go through his personal lawyer to make the Ukrainian president\u2019s access to the White House dependent on launching investigations into Trump\u2019s political opponents.\n\nIn his opening statement to Congress, Sondland said he had been \u201cdisappointed\u201d Trump had chosen to conduct an important strategic relationship through Rudy Giuliani and only realized later that the aim of the investigations Trump was demanding was to target the Democratic party and Joe Biden.\n\nThe ambassador was the latest in a series of witnesses, many of them career state department and foreign policy officials, providing new and detailed concerns about Trump and Giuliani and their attempts to influence Ukraine.", "description": "Acting White House chief of staff says politics and foreign policy are mixed \u2018all the time\u2019, before walking back remarks", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fb9950ecaf325385265156095812a7dc006707/0_3_4857_2914/master/4857.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=31cf6ea8e634a9f0c370ffafadeb6c39", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
