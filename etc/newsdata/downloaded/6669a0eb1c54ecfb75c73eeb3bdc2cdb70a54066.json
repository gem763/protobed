The AL playoffs begin Oct. 2 and it\u2019s uncertain whether Tauchman would be able to recover, rehab and be ready to play in the postseason.\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019m just bummed out for him, but we\u2019ve got to move forward,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Monday.\n\nThe 28-year-old Tauchman posted career highs across the board this season with a .277 average, 13 home runs and 47 RBIs through 87 games. He\u2019s also provided solid defense.\n\nTauchman exited after sustaining the injury while fielding Brock Holt\u2019s single to left field in the fourth inning. He had experienced left calf soreness and was receiving treatment as recently as Saturday.\n\n\u201cI planted coming in on that ball and I felt it grab up on me,\u201d Tauchman said after the game. \u201cIt felt a little bit like I got kicked, which would be weird because I was the only person in left field.\u201d\n\nTauchman went 2 for 2 with a two-run homer in Sunday\u2019s win on a night the Yankees broke their single-season home run record.\n\nThe former 10th-round draft pick was acquired from Colorado on March 23 and earned an opening day roster spot.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been such an important player for us,\u201d Boone said. \u201cI know he\u2019s a big part of us moving forward, even though obviously it\u2019s not going to be on the playing field for a while.\u201d\n\nBefore joining the Yankees, Tauchman hit .153 with only two RBIs in 52 games with the Rockies.\n\nTauchman\u2019s injury is the latest in a long string for New York. The Yankees have placed an MLB-record 29 players on the injured list this season. Cameron Maybin, who had been on the injured list, took Tauchman\u2019s place in left field.\n\nNew York entered Monday\u2019s series finale against rival Boston tied with Houston for the majors\u2019 best record at 94-50.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mike Tauchman's impressive first season with the New York Yankees might have come to an abrupt end.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gethin Coolbaugh"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/yankees_red_sox_baseball_39272_c0-161-3856-2409_s1770x1032.jpg?054c828dc81730efd02243569e18623219fbbe4d", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
