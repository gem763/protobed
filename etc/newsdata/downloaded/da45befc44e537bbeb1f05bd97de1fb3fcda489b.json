For a refresher, Lil Nas X publicly came out on social media at the end of June. The act inspired a flurry of thought pieces on the internet, unpacking what it meant to have such a visible queer artist in hip-hop.\n\nPaul Rivera says in the clip, \u201cAnd with all that early success, you felt the need to make an announcement, recently.\u201d Kevin Hart quickly interjects saying, \u201cHe said he was gay, so what?\u201d Rivera was then able to clarify his questions: \u201cWhy did he feel it was necessary to come out and say that?\u201d\n\nLil Nas X responds, \u201cIt\u2019s not that like, it\u2019s like being forced, it\u2019s knowing like, growing up to hate this sh*t.\u201d Hart then interrupts again, asking, \u201cHate what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHomosexuality. Gay people,\u201d Lil Nas X replies. \u201cCome on now, if you\u2019re really from the hood you know it\u2019s not something\u2026for me, the \u2018cool dude\u2019 with the song on top of everything to say this any other time it\u2019s like I\u2019m doing this for attention in my eyes. But if you\u2019re doing this while at the top, you know it\u2019s for real and showing that it doesn\u2019t really matter, I guess.\u201d\n\nMany people on Twitter have applauded the rapper for holding his ground in the situation, also citing that it sure looked like he was being gaslighted. It\u2019s one thing for Lil Nas X to be able to speak freely about his sexuality on social media. It\u2019s another for him to sit there being questioned by someone like Hart, who has a documented history of homophobia, including his tweets from 2011 in which he joked that if he caught his son playing with his daughter\u2019s dolls he\u2019d break the dollhouse over his head.\n\nLil Nas X\u2019s experience on The Shop is one that many LGBTQ people can relate to. Not only do we often have to come out throughout our lives to people, but many people question why we find it necessary. When someone like Hart asks, \u201cWho cares?\u201d it\u2019s a flippant unwillingness to admit the violence that LGBTQ communities face. Queer and trans youth face higher rates of overall violence, whether it\u2019s verbal (such as bullying) or dating and/or sexual violence. Additionally, there continues to be an epidemic of black trans women being killed merely for existing.\n\nThe rapper also seems to be aware of the politics of coming out. He cites how often when an artist reveals something about their sexuality, they\u2019re lambasted as simply doing it for attention. Lil Nas X coming out at the height of \u201cOld Town Road\u201d fame meant that he\u2019d be infallible to that criticism \u2014 a pretty genius, aware move on his part. In addition, it seems like he\u2019s keeping in mind other young people who might be struggling with their sexuality while growing up in a hostile environment that\u2019s unwelcoming of anything outside heteronormativity.\n\nIt\u2019s almost the perfect irony as well that Lil Nas X ends his statement with, \u201cYou know it\u2019s for real and showing that it doesn\u2019t really matter, I guess.\u201d Because while it does not matter however you identify, it does matter greatly that someone like him is speaking freely about it \u2014 and schooling a room full of men who clearly don\u2019t understand the power of his words.\n\nRelated: Lil Nas X Talks Fame, Going Viral, and More in His First Cover Story\n\nCheck this out:\n\nOriginally Appeared on Teen Vogue\n\n", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s not that like, it\u2019s like being forced, it\u2019s knowing like, growing up to hate this sh*t.\u201d", "authors": ["Gabe Bergado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pjayeBevLJwOFhvt3B10nQ--~B/aD0zMzc1O3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/teen_vogue_128/2c23f58e1024c61ada93277ffa918f1c"}
