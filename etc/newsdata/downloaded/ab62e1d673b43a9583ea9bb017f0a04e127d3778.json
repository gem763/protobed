No one expects us to win again - but we believe.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": "Japan captain Michael Leitch has warned Rugby World Cup quarter-final opponents South Africa that lightning can strike twice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7920/0a868498f2bc44d0a1e3f86a13477a0f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
