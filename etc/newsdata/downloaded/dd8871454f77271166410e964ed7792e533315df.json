The future isn't set in stone.\"\n\nFinalized on Tuesday in a last 27-hour session of talks in Monaco between authors and representatives of governments, the report is the culmination of two years of work by the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nCompiled by more than 100 authors who crunched 7,000 academic papers, the study documents the implications of warming oceans, fast-melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and shrinking glaciers for more than 1.3 billion people living in low-lying or high mountain regions.\n\nThe report projects sea levels could rise by one metre by 2100 \u2014 10 times the rate in the 20th century \u2014 if emissions keep climbing. Looking further forward, the rise could exceed five metres by 2300.\n\nA visitor stands at a spot that in 1963 was under the ice of the Pasterze glacier as the glacier in its current state is seen behind on Aug. 13 near Heiligenblut am Grossglockner, Austria.

As more carbon dioxide dissolves in the water, the oceans are also becoming more acidic, damaging ecosystems.\n\nA picture snapped June 2, 2018, shows dead fish on a beach covered with trash, including many plastic items, in the Hann Bay in Dakar. (Seyllou/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe rising temperatures are in turn starving the upper layers of the water of oxygen, suffocating marine life, creating growing dead zones and disrupting the circulation of ocean currents, which then unleashes more disruptive weather on land.\n\nThe authors say long lag times at work in oceans mean some of these changes will inevitably intensify over centuries \u2014 even if the world stopped emitting all its greenhouses gases tomorrow.\n\nBut if emissions are allowed to continue rising then the impacts are likely to start accelerating so rapidly that they will overwhelm societies' capacity to cope, with the poorest and most vulnerable communities and countries succumbing first.\n\n\"In a high emissions scenario, the chances of having any reasonable foothold to deal with the impacts becomes much smaller,\" said Matthias Garschagen, chair in human geography at LMU Munich, another author. \"Systems are changing in a way in recent history that they've never changed before.\"", "description": "Scientists behind a landmark study of the links between oceans, glaciers, ice caps and the climate delivered a stark warning to the world on Wednesday: slash emissions or watch cities vanish under rising seas, rivers run dry and marine life collapse", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296346.1569404886!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/694135868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
