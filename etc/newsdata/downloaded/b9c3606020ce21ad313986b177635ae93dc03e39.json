Final salary or 'defined benefit' pensions are typically generous and provide a guaranteed income for life. But increasing number of people are tempted to give them up for a range of reasons - the huge offers they receive from employers, the desire to invest their savings in the hope they will continue to grow, and the opportunity to leave whatever is left over to loved ones when they die. Meanwhile, pension freedoms launched in 2015 give people in 'defined contribution' schemes, where they and employers contribute to a pot that's invested for retirement, the power to do what they want with their savings once they reach the age of 55. Those still saving into final salary pensions cannot take advantage of these freedoms unless they transfer to a defined contribution scheme, but they have to get financial advice if their pot is worth \u00a330,000-plus. However, leaving a final salary pension scheme means people must bear all the investment risks to their retirement pot going forward. Should you transfer out of a final salary pension? Read a guide to the pros and cons here.\n\nThis also sometimes involves paying ongoing charges for advisers' own in-house platforms and funds on top, and exit fees if you want to leave. We looked at the dangers of this for pension investors here.\n\nRoyal London and LCP say an estimated half a million people have given up a final salary pension in exchange for a lump sum transfer and investment into a defined contribution arrangement since freedom reforms were launched in 2015.\n\nThey say some some people, like those whose lifetime savings are tied up in one scheme, would benefit from a partial transfer combining some guaranteed income with a more modest lump sum.\n\nSteve Webb, policy director at Royal London and a co-author of the report, said: 'For too many people this is an all-or-nothing option, involving giving up all of their guaranteed pension income in retirement.\n\n'We would like to see far more schemes offering partial transfers, where members can retain a secure pension but also enjoy greater flexibility. This genuinely could be the best of both worlds.'\n\nWebb added that some schemes that already offer partial transfers may not be promoting them, so it's worth savers who are interested actively asking if the option is available.\n\nJonathan Camfield, partner at LCP, said: 'Although there are technical and practical issues which schemes would need to address, large and small schemes have already demonstrated that these can be overcome.'\n\nThe report acknowledged there were downsides to partial transfers, and included doubts voiced by some financial advisers.\n\nShould I ditch my final salary pension? Seven questions to ask yourself to help spot red flags BEFORE you fork out for financial advice. Royal London has a guide to the pros and cons here.\n\nThese included the 'nightmare' of getting information out of scheme administrators, and the potential for people making 'poor decisions' or 'hedging their bets' and taking transfers that are not in their interest.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority is currently consulting on whether requiring final salary pension schemes to offer partial transfers would lead to better outcomes for savers.\n\nAnd it is also asking for feedback on whether scheme trustees, or another body like the Government-backed Money and Pensions Service, should be required to help people thinking about final salary transfers.\n\nHouse prices have stalled following their bounce back after the financial crisis, Nationwide's figures show\n\nIs your pension worth more than your home?\n\nThe importance of people making a considered decision about their final salary pension was highlighted separately by Hymans Robertson, which points out it could be worth significantly more than a home.\n\n'Figures from the ONS show that UK property prices are on the precipice of decline with Brexit on the horizon as the economic outlook remains uncertain,' says Ross Fleming, co-head of defined benefit investment at the financial consultancy.\n\n'Our analysis shows that defined benefit pensions, on the other hand, are expected to be more resilient than property in the near term, particularly if there is a no deal Brexit scenario.\n\n'They could, potentially, rise in value by 25 per cent relative to property.'\n\nAfter Brexit: 'In times of greater uncertainty when interest rates fall, defined benefit pensions increase in value. Conversely property prices are more likely to fall,' says Hymans Robertson\n\nFleming adds: 'So much focus is put on property as an individual\u2019s main asset, but those fortunate enough to have a defined pension may well be surprised that it is worth more. They may see its value becoming higher than the value of their home from October.\n\n'It is vital that those with a defined benefit pension recognise how valuable this important financial asset really is and make plans for what they will do with it.\n\n'In the post pensions freedoms world scheme members have a lot more choice about what to do with their pension pot.\n\n'If this becomes their biggest financial asset, engaging early with the scheme and seriously considering taking financial advice to determine the best course of action becomes even more important.'", "description": "Only around one in five employers let people take and invest a chunk of cash from their final salary pension, while retaining the right to some level of guaranteed income from their old scheme.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
