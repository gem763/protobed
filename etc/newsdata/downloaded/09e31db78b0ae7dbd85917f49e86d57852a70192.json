There is actually too much TV. It\u2019s no longer, \u201cWho has the time?\u201d but, \u201cThere is literally not enough time to watch it all.\u201d\n\nThis fall will see an explosion of streaming services in addition to the usual mass of new programming, with Disney and Apple set for big launches. It\u2019s a lot! So what to watch? We\u2019ve combed through most of the new series that have been announced, watched what we could, read the tea leaves on others, and, for the rest, relied on our gut, good casting, and batshit press releases.\n\nA lot of these shows we\u2019ve seen and can confirm are great. Some are here because they have great buzz. Some are on this list because of what they signify at the crossroads of the streaming apocalypse for the future of the industry. Others we expect you\u2019ll be talking about for, let\u2019s say, different reasons.\n\nHere, presented in order of premiere date, are the 20 most exciting new fall TV shows. Godspeed.\n\nOn Becoming a God in Central Florida\n\nAug. 25 at 10 p.m. ET on Showtime\n\nKirsten Dunst plays a waterpark employee in a down-trodden Orlando suburb in the 1990s. After her husband drowns the family\u2019s finances in a multi-level marketing scheme, rather than be crushed by the pyramid, she crafts a clever way to scale it. Beth Ditto co-stars. We will pause while you set your DVRs.\n\nWu-Tang: An American Saga\n\nSept. 4 on Hulu\n\nIf Showtime\u2019s four-part documentary series on the seminal rap group wasn\u2019t enough, now Hulu is coming in with a 10-episode dramatization of the Wu-Tang Clan origin story, set in the 1990s. (Fall TV\u2019s hottest recent-history time period!) Founding member RZA, who co-created the series, promises that the series goes even deeper than the documentary, telling reporters earlier this summer that it delves into things the group was \u201ctoo shy to say in front of a camera.\u201d\n\nUnbelievable\n\nSept. 13 on Netflix\n\nIt\u2019s not every fall TV show that counts a Pulitzer Prize-winning story as source material\u2014or a cast this good to tell it. Based on the ProPublica investigation, \u201cAn Unbelievable Story of Rape,\u201d the series centers on a young girl who recants a report she made that she had been raped at knifepoint after police don\u2019t believe her. When detectives in a neighboring state notice a series of rapes with similar details to her original story, they set out to find the truth. Toni Collette and Meritt Wever star as the detectives, with Booksmart breakout Kaitlyn Dever playing the young girl.\n\nProdigal Son\n\nSept. 23 at 9 p.m. ET on FOX\n\nSometimes network TV gets flak in the age of cable and streaming and dark, disturbing dramas. But, honestly, God bless it. On Prodigal Son, Malcolm Bright is a gifted criminal psychologist, attuned to how killers think because his father was the most notorious of them all, a serial killer named \u201cThe Surgeon.\u201d That\u2019s right, friends, MURDER IS THE FAMILY BUSINESS! Michael Sheen stars.\n\nEmergence\n\nSept. 24 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC\n\nBroadcast TV never met a pitch it didn\u2019t like about a creepy child who mysteriously appears in a small town with no memory of how he got there. This year\u2019s offering: Emergence, a new drama with a plot that is... well, exactly that. ABC actually rescued the series from NBC, which originally passed on the pilot. We are eternally grateful, as Fargo and Downward Dog\u2019s Allison Tolman is the lead, and any time Tolman is on our TV is a good time.\n\nCarol\u2019s Second Act\n\nSept. 26 at 9:30 p.m. ET on CBS\n\nMaybe without us even realizing it, Patricia Heaton has become the greatest modern sitcom star. Certainly, she\u2019s the most prolific, basically not having left our TV screens since Everybody Loves Raymond began in 1996\u2014a nine-season run followed by a year on the underrated Back to You and then a monster nine seasons on The Middle. Carol\u2019s Second Act is the perfect showcase for Heaton\u2019s talents, casting her as a woman in her fifties who, after a divorce, joins the ranks of twentysomethings training to be a doctor.\n\nPerfect Harmony\n\nSept. 26 at 8:30 p.m. ET on NBC\n\nIt\u2019s basically Pitch Perfect meets GCB starring Bradley Whitford and Anna Camp. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s our pitch. From that one sentence you already know whether this is your favorite new show or something that\u2019ll send you running for the hills.\n\nSunnyside\n\nSept. 26 at 9:30 p.m. ET on NBC\n\nThere is no phrase that makes a TV recommendation safer than \u201cexecutive produced by Michael Schur,\u201d network comedy\u2019s Last Great Hope and creator of The Good Place, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Parks and Recreation. He\u2019s behind Sunnyside, too, a series starring and created by Kal Penn about a disgraced politician who pivots to helping immigrants in their pursuit of becoming American citizens. Timely, eh?\n\nThe Unicorn\n\nSept. 26 at 8:30 p.m. ET on CBS\n\nNetwork TV\u2019s best new comedy stems from an idea that is perhaps not that groundbreaking: Walton Goggins is very attractive. The Justified alum plays against type here as an almost impossibly sweet widower, so involved in his daughters\u2019 recovery that he doesn\u2019t realize he needs to jumpstart his own life as well. With a nudge from his friends, he re-enters the dating pool, shocked to learn that he is its biggest catch: Not a divorcee or playboy, but there for the right reasons. In other words, a unicorn.\n\nThe Politician\n\nSept. 27 on Netflix\n\nRyan Murphy\u2019s first Netflix series is a surprisingly understated affair. Yeah, right. Starring Tony-winner Ben Platt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Lange, a red carpet\u2019s worth of beautiful gowns and diamonds, and the most opulent sets you\u2019ve seen since\u2026 Ryan Murphy\u2019s last show, it chronicles a privileged, wealthy young Californian male\u2019s upwardly mobile political ambitions.\n\nBless the Harts\n\nSept. 29 at 8:30 p.m. ET on FOX\n\nWe\u2019re just gonna throw a bunch of names at you for this one. The new FOX animated series, which takes place in the same universe as King of the Hill, is created by Emily Spivey (SNL, Wine Country), produced by Christopher Miller and Phil Lord (The LEGO Movie, 21 Jump Street), and features the voice cast of Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, Jillian Bell, Ike Barinholtz, and The Other Two\u2019s Drew Tarver. Kumail Nanjiani recurs as the voice of Jesus, naturally.\n\nGodfather of Harlem\n\nSept. 29 at 10 p.m. ET on Epix\n\nOscar-winner Forest Whitaker stars in this 1960s-set series about notorious real-life crime boss Ellsworth \u201cBumpy\u201d Johnson. (His death is the catalyst for the events of the Denzel Washington movie American Gangster.) The series explores Johnson\u2019s influence on his community, as well as his surprising relationship with Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch, reprising the role after playing the activist in Ava DuVernay\u2019s Selma).\n\nAlmost Family\n\nOct. 2 at 9 p.m. ET on FOX\n\nThis is the most talked-about fall show among TV critics, but not for all the right reasons. Based in part on the Australian drama series Sisters, Almost Family centers on a girl who discovers that her dad, a fertility doctor, secretly used his own sperm to father over 100 children. Rattled, she starts to forge relationships with her new siblings. In interviews this summer, it\u2019s clear that producers think they\u2019ve landed on a new This Is Us-like series about emotional human connection. The reality that this is a lighthearted dramatization of what appears to be medical rape seems to be lost on them. The question is: Will viewers care?\n\nBack to Life\n\nOct. 6 on Showtime\n\nThe new series, which already aired in the U.K., is being called \u201cthe next Fleabag.\u201d That\u2019s partly because it is very good, and from a distinct, darkly humorous point of view, thanks to creator and star Daisy Haggard. It also literally took over the time slot in which Fleabag used to air. Comparisons end there with this series, which is about a woman navigating a return to her small hometown after 18 years in prison for a violent crime.\n\nBatwoman\n\nOct. 6 at 8 p.m. ET on The CW\n\nIt speaks volumes about omnipresent producer Greg Berlanti\u2014he of 15 shows airing in the 2018-19 TV season\u2014and his push for racial, gender, and sexual diversity in his series that the monumental milestone of TV\u2019s first live-action lesbian superhero lead character arrives with a whiff of, \u201cAbout time.\u201d Ruby Rose (Orange Is the New Black) will don the spandex of Kate Kane, better known as Batwoman, in the CW\u2019s latest DC Comics adaptation.\n\nLimetown\n\nOct. 16 on Facebook Watch\n\nFor all the talk of new major streaming services coming up, don\u2019t forget about the one you\u2019re already too exasperated and overwhelmed to bother watching! After finally producing its first breakout show last year, the Elisabeth Olsen-starring Sorry For Your Loss, Facebook Watch\u2019s next big play will be Limetown, based on the popular podcast about a fictional town where 300 people disappeared at a neuroscience facility. Jessica Biel and Stanley Tucci will star, and, should you need reminding, Biel was very good in The Sinner!\n\nModern Love\n\nOct. 18 on Amazon Prime\n\nBased on the popular New York Times column, the new anthology series tells self-contained stories about the different ways we connect and love, romantic or otherwise. Think of it as Black Mirror, but... nice. Each episode features a new cast and new relationships based on actual columns, tugging at different heart strings each time. Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, Tina Fey, Dev Patel, Catherine Keener, John Slattery, and more star.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nNov. 12 on Disney+\n\nI don\u2019t know much about The Mandalorian, a series set in the Star Wars universe starring Narcos\u2019 Pedro Pascal as the titular character. But I do know that it is the big anchor series for the Nov. 12 launch date of the new Disney+ streaming platform, which will be the biggest disruptor yet in the burgeoning streaming wars\u2014at least until we learn anything tangible about Apple\u2019s own TV plans. A host of Disney, Marvel, and children\u2019s content will also premiere the same day, but The Mandalorian seems primed to be the most attention-grabbing, at least in the traditional TV sense... whatever that means.\n\nDollface\n\nNov. 15 on Hulu\n\nDollface begins with a brutal breakup scene, and then a brutal realization: After spending years off in Boyfriend Land, Jules has lost touch with all her former girlfriends. Dollface takes a unique, sometimes jarringly surreal journey through the well-trodden territory of \u201cwhy don\u2019t I get along with girlie girls?\u201d and Kat Dennings as Jules couldn\u2019t be a more appealing, more deadpan avatar for the ride.\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nThis Fall on Apple TV Plus\n\nThe industry\u2019s greatest mystery: What the hell is Apple\u2019s TV service? Outside of the litany of big names wooed with millions of dollars\u2014Aniston! Spielberg! Oprah!\u2014nothing is known about how this content will be distributed and how consumers will access it, let alone for how much. All whispers are that the service is still set to launch this fall, ostensibly with Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s The Morning Show, the only series we\u2019ve seen any actual footage from. And by footage, we mean a B-roll of a TV set with actors\u2019 disembodied voices reciting dialogue seemingly left over from The Newsroom. Apple is either keeping secret a game-changing feat of entertainment brilliance or a total shit show.", "description": "A rundown of the best, the buzziest, and the sure-to-be talked about new shows, from a quirky Kirsten Dunst drama to lesbian Batwoman to \u201cStar Wars\u201d and everything in between.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1565994891/190818-fallon-tv-shows-tease_rixtwy"}
