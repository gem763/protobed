But he faces a stiff challenge from retired military chief Benny Gantz, whose centrist Blue and White party is running even with Netanyahu\u2019s Likud. Both parties could struggle to form a majority coalition with smaller allies, though, forcing them into a potential unity government.\n\nNetanyahu has tried to portray himself as a seasoned statesman who is uniquely qualified to lead the country through challenging times. Gantz has tried to paint Netanyahu as divisive and scandal-plagued, offering himself as a calming influence and an honest alternative.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote marks their second showdown of the year after drawing even in the previous election in April.\n\nNetanyahu appeared poised to remain in office at the time, with his traditional allies of nationalist and ultra-religious Jewish parties controlling a parliamentary majority.\n\nBut Avigdor Lieberman, his mercurial ally-turned-rival, refused to join the new coalition, citing excessive influence it granted the ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties. Without a parliamentary majority, Netanyahu dissolved parliament and called a new election.\n\nOpinion polls have forecast similar results this time around, potentially putting Lieberman once again in the role of kingmaker.\n\nAfter voting Tuesday, Lieberman reiterated his promise to force a unity government between Likud and Blue and White. He vowed there won\u2019t be a third round of elections and said the parties will have to deal with the \u201cconstellation\u201d that emerges from this vote.\n\nThe performance by the Soviet-born politician\u2019s Yisrael Beitenu party is just one of the factors that could determine Netanyahu\u2019s future. Several small parties are fighting to squeak past the minimum 3.25% threshold for entering parliament. The performances of these parties could make or break Netanyahu\u2019s ability to form a coalition.\n\nThe longtime Israeli leader is desperate to secure a narrow 61-seat majority in parliament with his hard-line religious and nationalist allies who are expected to approve legislation that would grant Netanyahu immunity from prosecution.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against Netanyahu in three separate corruption cases, pending a long-delayed pre-trial hearing scheduled next month.\n\nWith his career on the line, Netanyahu has campaigned furiously and taken a late hard turn to the right in hopes of rallying his nationalist base.\n\nHe\u2019s staged a flurry of media appearances to beseech supporters to vote in large numbers to stave off the prospect of a left-wing government he says will endanger the country\u2019s security. He also has accused his opponents of conspiring with Arab politicians to \u201csteal\u201d the election, a message that has drawn accusations of racism and incitement.\n\nHeavier turnout by Arab voters, many of whom stayed home in April, could hurt Netanyahu. After casting his ballot, the leader of the main Arab faction in parliament, Ayman Odeh, said Netanyahu was \u201cobsessive\u201d in his incitement toward Arabs. He said the answer was for that his constituents \u201cmust be first-class voters on the way to becoming first-class citizens.\u201d\n\nVoter turnout has emerged as a key element of this election day, which is a national holiday aimed at encouraging participation. In April\u2019s election, turnout was about 69%, slightly below the 72% figure in the previous election in 2015.\n\nAs of 10 a.m., Israel\u2019s central election committee said some 15% of Israelis had already cast their ballots. It marked more than a 2% increase over the figure at the same time in April.\n\nAron Shaviv, who managed Netanyahu\u2019s 2015 re-election campaign, said Netanyahu believed \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as bad coverage.\u201d But he thought his former boss may be making a mistake by appealing so heavily to hard-liners and giving up on moderate voters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s turned people off, playing the right-left polarization as far as he possibly can,\u201d he said.\n\nA centerpiece of his eleventh-hour agenda has been the pledge to extend Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank and to annex all the Jewish settlements there, something Netanyahu has refrained from doing during his decade-plus in power because of the far-reaching diplomatic repercussions.\n\nHis proposal sparked a cascade of international condemnation, including from Europe and Saudi Arabia, an influential Arab country that has quiet, unofficial ties with Israel. The U.S., however, had a muted reaction, suggesting Netanyahu coordinated his plan with the Americans ahead of time.\n\nNetanyahu has also been flaunting his close ties to President Donald Trump, and the prospect of a defense pact between their countries shortly after the election, as part of his frantic push get out the vote and dictate the election\u2019s agenda on his terms.\n\nTrump chimed in his prediction, telling reporters at the White House on Monday that it \u201cwill be a very interesting outcome. It\u2019s gonna be close.\u201d\n\nAfter casting his ballot in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said he could confirm the vote would be \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\nVoting in his hometown of Rosh Haayin in central Israel, Gantz urged all Israelis to hope. \u201cWe will bring hope, we will bring change, without corruption, without extremism,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his attacks on Arabs, Netanyahu has made unfounded claims of fraud in Arab voting areas and unsuccessfully pushed for legislation to place cameras in polling stations on election day.\n\nHe also claimed to have located a previously unknown Iranian nuclear weapons facility and said another war against Gaza militants is probably inevitable. In some of his TV interviews, the typically reserved Netanyahu has raised his voice and gestured wildly as he warned of his imminent demise.\n\nYohanan Plesner, president of the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute think tank and a former lawmaker, said he didn\u2019t think it reflected genuine panic.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re observing Israel\u2019s most seasoned and competent politician who knows exactly how to fire up his base and is now using all his tools at his disposal in order to ensure victory,\u201d he said.\n\nPolling stations opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday with exit polls expected at the end of the voting day at 10 p.m. Official results are projected to come in overnight.\n\nThat\u2019s when the real jockeying may get underway, with attention shifting to President Reuven Rivlin who is responsible for choosing a candidate for prime minister. He is supposed to select the leader who he believes has the best chance of putting together a stable coalition. The honor usually goes to the head of the largest party, but not necessarily. Just as important is the number of lawmakers outside his own party who recommend him to the president.\n\nRivlin\u2019s selection will then have up to six weeks to form a coalition. If he fails, the president can appoint an alternative candidate and give him up to four weeks for the task.\n\nIn an overnight video, Rivlin said he will do everything in his power to \u201cget an elected government in Israel as soon as possible and to avoid another election campaign.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Israelis vote Tuesday in an unprecedented repeat election that will decide whether longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power despite a looming indictment on corruption charges.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aron Heller"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/israel_elections_96674_c0-562-6720-4480_s1770x1032.jpg?ea4c32279fa22620a73d0b47dd5403ae48bd9a37", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
