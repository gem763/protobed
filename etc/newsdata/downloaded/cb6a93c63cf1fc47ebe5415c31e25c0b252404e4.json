The club would have taken a leap forward, in terms of sponsors, our image, our growth, but in the end it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nBarca president Josep Maria Bartomeu said last week that the club did everything possible to sign Neymar, but admitted they could not meet PSG\u2019s asking price for the forward, who hit 105 goals in four seasons for the Catalans.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened with the directors, I know they were speaking with Neymar, he told me how things were going. He was really looking forward to coming back,\u201d Messi, who has been unable to play this season due to a calf injury, said.\n\n\u201cI understand it\u2019s difficult to negotiate with PSG and with Neymar because he\u2019s one of the best. These negotiations are never easy.\u201d\n\nBarca\u2019s all-time top scorer also said he had no plans to quit the Catalans any time soon after it was confirmed by the club that his contract contains a clause that allows him to decide at the end of each season whether he wants to leave for free.\n\n\u201cI can say that I want to be at Barcelona for as long as I can and end my career here because this is my home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to stay here if I can stay in good shape, play well, feel important and if I see we have a winning project.\u201d\n\n($1 = 0.9068 euros)", "description": "Lionel Messi says he wanted Neymar to return to Barcelona this year as the Brazilian would have helped the club take a leap forward, adding that his former team mate was looking forward to rejoining the La Liga champions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429087921&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B197-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
