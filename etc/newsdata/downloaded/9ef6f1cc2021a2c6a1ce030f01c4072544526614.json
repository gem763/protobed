Screenshot via REUTERS\n\nBy Aram Roston and Joshua Schneyer\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - In emails to his colleagues over the years, Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr has denigrated students and staff at the Christian university he runs, referring to one student as \u201cemotionally imbalanced and physically retarded\u201d and calling the school\u2019s police chief a \u201chalf-wit.\u201d\n\nThe barbed comments, contained in email exchanges reviewed by Reuters, emerge as the evangelical political leader is seeking to stem a rash of news reports about his stewardship of the Virginia-based university.\n\nFalwell said this week he has asked U.S. federal authorities to investigate whether former board members and employees at the nonprofit university may have broken the law and divulged internal school documents to journalists. The request came after recent reports by Reuters and Politico describing how Falwell has managed Liberty.\n\nFalwell told the Associated Press on Tuesday that he had contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that the email disclosures constituted an \u201cattempted coup\u201d aimed at securing his ouster from Liberty, where he has served as president since 2008. The FBI declined to comment.\n\nAs he complains of being targeted by critics, Reuters has found that Falwell himself was disparaging Liberty students, staff and parents for years in emails to Liberty administrators.\n\nThe several dozen emails reviewed by Reuters span nearly a decade-long period starting in 2008. In the emails, Falwell insults some Liberty students, calling them \u201csocial misfits.\u201d In others, he blasts faculty members and senior Liberty staff:\n\n-Ronald Sones, then the dean of the engineering school, was \u201ca bag of hot air\u201d who \u201ccouldn\u2019t spell the word \u2018profit,\u2019\u201d Falwell wrote in 2011. Sones is no longer the dean and could not be reached for comment.\n\n-Richard Hinkley, the campus police chief, was \u201ca half-wit and easy to manipulate\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to speak publicly. Hinkley could not be reached for comment.\n\n-Of Kevin Keys, then Liberty\u2019s associate athletics director, Falwell wrote in 2012: \u201cOnly get Kevin involved in something if you want it not to work.\u201d Contacted by Reuters, Keys said: \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that and I would prefer not to comment.\u201d\n\nFalwell was asked to comment on excerpts and summaries of the emails cited in this article. David Corry, Liberty\u2019s general counsel, said Liberty wouldn\u2019t respond \u201cwithout knowing the details or seeing email chains in their entirety.\u201d\n\nSTEWARDSHIP UNDER SCRUTINY\n\nFalwell, a prominent supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, has been dogged by recent stories about his private dealings and his stewardship of Liberty, which was founded by his father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Among the stories: his ties to Trump\u2019s jailed lawyer Michael Cohen; his business venture with a former Miami hotel pool attendant; and his role in steering a $1.2 million piece of university property to his personal fitness trainer.\n\nOn August 27, Reuters reported how Falwell had helped his young personal trainer, Benjamin Crosswhite. In one email, Falwell wrote, \u201clet\u2019s cut him a sweet deal,\u201d and said -- referring to his wife Rebecca -- \u201cBecki and I wouldn\u2019t mind working out over there with Ben as a trainer because it is more private.\u201d\n\nRecords reviewed by Reuters showed how Falwell approved a 2016 deal to sell Crosswhite a sprawling 18-acre fitness facility the university owned. The deal was financed by Liberty, and Crosswhite put no money down. Crosswhite declined to comment at the time, and the university spokesperson said that it was a good deal for Liberty.\n\nOn September 9, Politico published emails involving Falwell, in a story that alleged he had propagated a \u201cculture of fear\u201d at Liberty and had other inside dealings with family and friends.\n\nFor this story, Reuters has reviewed dozens of additional Falwell email exchanges with other Liberty executives or business partners he considered close confidants. All were sent from his personal account, an Earthlink email domain.\n\nThe selection of emails provides a glimpse of the management style Falwell employs to run the nonprofit Christian university, which reports $2.8 billion in assets. Several of the emails take a derogatory tone toward Liberty parents, students, and other university officials.", "description": "Falwell said this week he has asked U.S. federal authorities to investigate whether former board members and employees at the nonprofit university may have broken the law and divulged internal school documents to journalists.
