S&P 500 index futures ESU19, -0.35% declined 13.10 points, or 0.4%, at 2,995.50, while Nasdaq-100 futures NQU19, -0.61% fell 49.75 points, or 0.6%, at 7,858.50.\n\nFriday trade left the Dow DJIA, +0.14% 0.5% from its record at 27,359.16 hit on July 15, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.07% stood about the same distance from its all-time high at 3,025.86 set on July 26. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.22% was 1.8% from its all-time closing high at 8,330.21, also hit on July 26.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nWall Street is fixated on an attack of Saudi oil production facilities that happened on Saturday, knocking out 5.7 million barrels of daily production, representing about 5% of the world\u2019s oil output.\n\nThe largest-ever disruption to oil production, as it has been described by experts, has momentarily overshadowed a much-anticipated gathering of the Fed on Sept. 17-18 and unsettled the investment community even as all three major stock benchmarks stand on the verge of carving out record peaks.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, +9.97% the U.S. benchmark contract, was up 8.8%, or $4.84, at $59.69 a barrel on electronic exchange on Monday, set for its biggest one-day climb since February of 2016, while November Brent crude BRNX19, +10.73% jumped more than 19% at its peak, which would have marked its sharpest-ever daily rise, but has since pulled to a gain of $5.85, or 9.7%, to trade at $66.05 a barrel. That would also mark the sharpest daily rise for the international benchmark grade since 2016.\n\nSurging oil prices hold the potential to disrupt the global economy if the rise is sustained, experts say. Rising prices would also come as global economies, including China, a major importer of oil, has shown signs of economic strains.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump said he authorized the release of oil, if needed, from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, to mitigate any price surges. The U.S. holds about 630 million barrels of oil in the reserves, which is viewed as the biggest such stockpile of crude.\n\nHowever, market participants are worried about the duration of the oil disruption to Saudi Arabia\u2019s production and the possibility of further escalation between Saudi Arabia and those responsible for the Saturday attack of its Abqaiq plant and Khurais oil field. Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack but the U.S. has blamed Iran, which the Islamic Republic has forcefully denied.\n\nWashington and Tehran are locked in their own dispute after Trump pulled out of a global nuclear pact with the country and imposed fresh sanctions on its oil exports.\n\nStill some strategists appeared somewhat sanguine about the impact of the Middle East drama on U.S. markets.\n\n\u201cIt will take a lot to disrupt the bull case for US stocks and the today\u2019s selloff that stemmed from the Saudi oil field attacks could see buyers eventually re-emerge,\u201d wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage Oanda, in a daily research note. \u201cThe possibility of a US military escalation remains a key risk but that is probably not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.96% fell 6.7 basis points to 1.834% after the bond market saw the biggest weekly sell off in several years. Bond prices fall as yields rise.\n\nGold prices GCZ19, +0.79% jumped 0.8% to $1,511.60 an ounce, while the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.19% relative to a basket of leading rivals.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index HSI, -0.83% fell 0.8%. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, -0.38% fell 0.4% while the U.K.\u2019s commodity-heavy FTSE UKX, -0.13% declined 0.2%.", "description": "U.S. stock-indexes on Monday are set to pull back from record range and the Dow was set to halt a win streak at eight consecutive days as a weekend attack...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR333_aramco_ZG_20190915232025.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
