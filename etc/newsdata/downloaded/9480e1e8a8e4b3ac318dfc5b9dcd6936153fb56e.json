If not the UK will leave with no deal.\n\n\u201cThe surrender act and its authors are undermining negotiations, but if EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBut an Elysee official told Reuters: \u201cThe president told [Mr Johnson] that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier\u2019s team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles.\u201d\n\nDavid Frost, the PM\u2019s chief EU negotiator, will travel to Brussels on Monday, while Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will visit a number of European capitals, ahead of the crucial EU summit on 17-18 October.\n\nThe prime minister had been expected to travel to Europe himself but plans for a whistle-stop diplomatic tour appear to have been put on ice.\n\nIt comes as:\n\nTory cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the government had \u201cno plan\u201d for what might happen if parliament blocks a no deal.\n\nMr Barclay signalled the government could shift on its plan to offer Stormont a veto on its plans for an all-island regulatory system after Brexit.\n\nTentative conversations were being held between Labour MPs and cabinet ministers over the PM\u2019s deal as Mr Barclay said the government was \u201dconsidering\u201d a Commons vote on the plan.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s bullish stance will ramp up pressure on opposition leaders, as squabbling parties meet to try to unite around a strategy to stop Mr Johnson from defying the law.\n\nCross-party talks stalled last week amid disagreements over who should lead an interim government if the prime minister is toppled in a no-confidence vote.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the meeting on Monday, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cThe cross-party meeting will decide what next steps we can take together to hold the government to account, and to ensure the prime minister adheres to the law in seeking an extension if no deal is reached by 19 October.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Labour will try to force a parliamentary vote to demand the full legal text of the prime minister\u2019s Brexit plan.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cThe legal text is important because we suspect it will confirm that the government\u2019s proposals unavoidably mean the introduction of infrastructure in Northern Ireland, and that this will contradict the assurances Johnson gave in the House on Thursday.", "description": "Boris Johnson has warned the EU that his plans are the final opportunity to avert no deal as his hopes of securing a Brexit agreement stood on a knife edge.Ahead of a critical week, the prime minister issued an ultimatum to the French president Emmanuel Macron and said Brussels must not be lured into", "authors": ["Lizzy Buchan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/og8zyJnVWxYIIuWObNTr8A--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/0618195d6135fc8996035598d26c114f", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
