Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to announce their third-quarter results, with Bank of America following up the next day.\n\nBanks\u2019 earnings are expected to have held up well despite low interest rates. Still, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy change means difficult times ahead for most banks.\n\nStanding out among dismal sectors\n\nHere are expected changes in earnings per share for the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 SPX, -1.56%, based on weighted aggregate consensus earnings estimates among analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence:\n\nS&P 500 sector Expected change in Q3 EPS from year-earlier quarter Health Care 1.81% Financials 1.73% Industrials 0.94% Communication Services 0.07% Consumer Discretionary -0.01% Consumer Staples -0.54% Utilities -3.77% Information Technology -8.56% Real Estate -14.34% Materials -20.65% Energy -31.58% S&P 500 Index -4.11% S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nThe financial sector is expected to rank a close second for earnings growth. Considering the boost to earnings per share from stock repurchases, that is unimpressive.\n\nSilver lining\n\nBased on his analysis of the Federal Reserve\u2019s industry data through Sept. 25, Odeon Capital Group analyst Dick Bove expects \u201cbig universal and investment banks ... to publish positive results\u201d for the quarter. In a report Oct. 7, Bove named Citigroup C, -2.57% and Morgan Stanley MS, -2.11% as his favorites.\n\nBased on the Fed data, the veteran analyst said commercial real estate loan growth had slowed, and that commercial and industrial lending was at a standstill. He added that lending to non-bank financial companies was soaring and that \u201chome mortgage growth seems to have found its footing and is steadily increasing.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s threat\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s decision to make two cuts to the federal funds rate during the third quarter was meant to help reduce the chance of the U.S. economy from slipping into recession, but it is a gloomy development for most banks. It means shorter-term loans that are indexed to short-term rates will reprice at lower rates, reducing lenders\u2019 net interest income. Most banks aren\u2019t positioned to make up for the lost revenue with lower funding costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the bond market has anticipated further central-bank stimulus by pushing long-term interest rates down considerably, which hurts the banks.\n\nPresident Trump continues to demand much lower interest rates, believing the U.S. is at a competitive disadvantage to other developed economies. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Frederick Cannon listed the banks he expected to suffer the greatest earnings declines if the Fed\u2019s new policy were taken to a logical extreme, with negative interest rates.\n\nOn Oct. 8, bank analysts at Jefferies, led by Ken Usdin, lowered 2019 earnings estimates for 23 of 38 banks, while lowering stock-price targets for 24. Looking ahead, he noted \u201cestimated net income growth flips to negative in \u201920 before returning to a modest positive in \u201921.\u201d\n\nIn our earnings preview last quarter, we pointed out that the S&P 500 banking industry group was trading at a forward price-to-earnings valuation of about 60% of the full index\u2019s valuation. That was below the long-term level of about 70%.\n\nAs of the close Oct. 7, the banks traded for 62% of the valuation of the index. Usdin wrote: \u201cWhile valuations remain appealing on the surface (both absolute and relative), EPS estimates are quite dependent on the Fed\u2019s uncertain future path for interest rates. This makes it harder to gain conviction\u201d in valuations.\n\nUsdin called this year\u2019s action for bank stocks a \u201croller coaster,\u201d and the chart shows much greater volatility for the group than for the full S&P 500:\n\nFactSet\n\nEarnings estimates\n\nHere are expected EPS results for the largest 10 U.S. banks by total assets, among analysts polled by FactSet, compared with actual results from the third quarter of 2018:\n\nYou can click on the tickers for more about each company.\n\nHere\u2019s how the group\u2019s consensus quarterly EPS estimates have been revised since the end of the second quarter:\n\nAnd here\u2019s how the banks\u2019 full-year EPS estimates for 2019 have changed since the end of the first quarter:\n\nMoving out to 2020 estimates, we can see larger recent estimate cuts:\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The hottest stock-market sector in the past year beats technology and real estate\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "description": "The effects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate cuts will be felt for an extended period.", "authors": ["Philip Van Doorn", "Investing Columnist"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS860_Citigr_ZG_20191008102748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
