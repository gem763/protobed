Costello showed a slide that attempted to move down the scale of available supply.\n\nThe CDL universe is 10 million CDL holders. But as Costello noted, that includes his grandfather, who still has his CDL license and hasn\u2019t driven a truck in 20 years. That\u2019s indicative of the 10 million number not meaning all that much. It also includes jobs like limousine drivers.\n\nUsing Department of Labor data, Costello estimates that within that 10 million there are 3.5 million drivers who would be considered truck drivers.\n\nOf those, about 1.7 million would be considered heavy and tractor-trailer drivers. But that includes drivers like cement truck or dump truck drivers, and they aren\u2019t part of the driver shortage.\n\nThe Department of Labor lists 864,000 drivers as \u201cfor-hire trucking heavy and tractor trailer drivers.\u201d But Costello said that does not consist solely of over-the-road drivers, where the problem lies.\n\nCostello estimated that number is 500,000. Referring to his estimate of a 50,000 shortage of over the road drivers in 2017, \u201cif I said we were short that on a base of 3.5 million truck drivers, you\u2019d say what\u2019s the big deal? But when I say we\u2019re short 50,000 on a base of half a million, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nCostello got to his 175,000 number by taking current shortages, projected demand, and the fact that the industry is going to need to mint 900,000 drivers over the next 10 years just to replace drivers leaving the industry, mostly through retirements.\n\nWith a shortage of 175,000 drivers, \u201cthe industry is in for a lot of hurt,\u201d Costello said. Given the key role of trucking to commerce, \u201cso is the economy.\u201d\n\nCostello\u2019s data showed that turnover rates in the industry last year were about 87%, but in the less than truckload sector, it was 9%. Why? Because, as Costello noted, the LTL drivers generally get home at night.\n\nThe turnover rate in the first two months of 2017 was in excess of 90%, he said, and had actually fallen to less than 90% in the fourth quarter, which by all accounts was a stronger quarter for the trucking market. But Costello said that could be explained by the impact of higher pay and other retention steps kicking in and keeping more drivers with their existing employer.\n\nThe highs and the lows of that number, according to Costello, were about 50% in 2009 and 2010, after the great recession was in full swing. (Drivers were actually in surplus then, he said). And the all-time high turnover rate for turnover? It was in 2005, at a whopping 136%, which Costello said is not likely to happen again, because companies are smarter now about retention.\n\nThe driver shortage is occurring as truck productivity is beginning to slide, Costello said, though they are not necessarily unrelated. \u201cIt used to be commonplace for a truck to get 125,000 to 130,000 miles per year,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they struggle to get 100,000 miles.\u201d\n\nHe did not take the bait on a question about ELDs creating this problem. Rather, Costello said. data from ELDs can actually help a fleet become more efficient because it has a greater data trove to work with to improve operations. The small fleets that he said were probably the ones holding out in installing ELDs until the last minute\u2013which was April 1\u2013will not benefit from their own in-house data for awhile.\n\nTime = money\n\nOne of the best ways to improve efficiency, Costello said, is more efficient use of time. \u201cDrivers are only driving today a fraction of what they could be doing,\u201d he said, blaming such things as delays at shipper facilities.\n\nBut ELDs have created the problem where truckers will shut down for the day early if they see available parking. It all goes together: \u201cIf we just spent less time waiting at shipper facilities, but also not be concerned about finding parking, you could get driver productivity up without doing a whole heck of a lot,\u201d Costello said.\n\nCostello reviewed widely-known data points in his bullish forecast for the trucking market, including unemployment and housing stats. But he also pointed to the inventory to sales ratio as signaling that current market strength might continue.\n\nSeveral times during the presentation, Costello spoke about the strong market of 2014 turning into the weak ones of 2015 and 2016. The inventory to sales ratio during those years climbed above 1.4, but it has since dropped back to less than 1.35. Still, it\u2019s higher than what Costello showed on the chart for 2014.\n\n\u201cInventories are no longer a drag on truck freight volumes,\u201d he said.\n\nBut even though inventories haven\u2019t returned to the levels of four years ago, Costello said the nature of the market has changed and that comparisons with the past are not always indicative of the strength of a market. The rise of e-commerce means that \u201cwhen we demand to have it in just a couple of days, if I order something here (in Washington, Costello\u2019s home area), it\u2019s sitting outside of DC, it\u2019s not coming from California.\u201d To enable that, greater inventory is needed, Costello said. \u201cWe will cycle through it faster, but we will have more of it.\u201d\n\nCostello saw the enemy to the strong freight market, and apologies to Pogo, but he is us. Risks to the strong economy are \u201cself-imposed,\u201d citing trade wars and the tariffs that go along with that.\n\nIn his position as chief economist of ATA, Costello said he has been an observer to current NAFTA negotiations, a process he called \u201cvery interesting.\u201d His numbers on the impact of an abandoned NAFTA deal seemed narrow, but he took a very NAFTA trucker-specific approach, citing 47,000 jobs in transport and 31,000 of those specifically truck drivers. But as has been noted by many observers, the impact of a NAFTA that dies to the economy could be far greater than just jobs that can be tied specifically to the free trade deal.\n\nThe negotiations are coming to a head, Costello said, and the risks are high; the July 1 date of the Mexican election puts an unofficial deadline on the talks. A new round of talks begins in a few days, \u201cand the administration is getting antsy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to announce something with Canada and Mexico and there are still things hanging out there,\u201d describing the Canadian and Mexican negotiators are \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d", "description": "The number is 175,000 out several years, against a base of a half-million.", "authors": ["John Has An Almost Career Covering Commodities", "Most Of The Time At S P Global Platts.
