Not even Tsonga disco king Papa Penny could resist its influence. Now, he has released an amapiano album titled Silema.\n\nSpeaking to Move! he admits that many were caught off-guard by his sudden genre switch.

After having a social media quarrel earlier in the year with president of EFF, Julius Malema, he called him Silema.
