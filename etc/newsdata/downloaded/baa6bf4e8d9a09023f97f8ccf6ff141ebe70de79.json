Now I distribute the treats, one in each box, on a morning meaning they last over the week.\"\n\n(Image: Emma Bradley)\n\nEmma also uses cashback sites like Topcashback when making purchases - especially in the run-up to Christmas and when shopping online. You get money back on your purchases. These sites pay you a return when you shop through them online.\n\nSince becoming a blogger she's also learnt about the importance of keeping an eye on your outgoings.\n\n\"Check your bank account for direct debits and standing orders. It is easy to forget what you have signed up too and no longer need,\" Emma warned.\n\n\"And one of the biggest savings I've made has been by switching utility providers. Put it in your diary every sixth month to check that you are on the best tariff.\"\n\nHer final tip is to make use of charity shops - but she says it's not just about the hidden gems.\n\n\"The charity shops always have cook books for sale. Buy one and get cooking, I find if the children are involved they will eat it too!\"\n\nPasta and meatballs (serves 4)\n\n(Image: Emma Bradley)\n\nPasta - 49p Passata - 40p Tinned sweetcorn - 39p Musclefood meatballs (packet of 20) - 2.63\n\nTotal: \u00a33.91, per person: 97p\n\nSausage casserole (serves 4)\n\n(Image: Emma Bradley)\n\nCasserole cooking sauce - \u00a31.70 Potatoes (mashed) - 50p Musclefood sausages (8) - \u00a31.32 Veg - \u00a31\n\nTotal: \u00a34.52, per person: \u00a31.13\n\nTurkey and mushroom mince with leeky potatoes (serves 4)\n\n(Image: Emma Bradley)\n\nMusclefood turkey mince (200g) - 64p Chestnut mushrooms (250g) - 80p Onions 85p Celery - 65p Chicken stock cube - 20p Carrots - 15p Potatoes - 50p Cheddar cheese - 40p Leeks - \u00a31 Cream cheese - 30p\n\nTotal: \u00a35.49, per person: \u00a31.37", "description": "Emma serves up eight hearty yet balanced meals like shepherd\u2019s pie, casserole and meatballs for her husband and children every week", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Emma Bradley"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552917.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_I-have-this-story-and-thought-it-might-be-of-interest-to-you-Let-me-know-if-youd-like-any-high-res.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
