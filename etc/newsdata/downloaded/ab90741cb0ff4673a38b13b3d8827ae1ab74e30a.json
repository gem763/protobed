I think it's really beautiful. That's why we are called the 'Rainbow Nation'.\"\n\n\"In the team as well we have different races, which is really beautiful.\"\n\nKolisi\u00b4s promotion to captain last year was seen by many as a crucial step for South Africa, as rugby continues to break the shackles of its past image in a country where racial tensions in sport often spill over into politics.\n\nKolisi is aware of the responsibility on his broad shoulders and embraces it.\n\n\"It just shows that when we decide to work together for one goal or as a team and as a country, we can make anything happen, and achieve all the goals and dreams,\" he said.\n\n\"That's why we want to give our best this week, and hopefully play in the final next week. It would be huge for our country, as I've seen what it has done for the country before.\n\n\"I was old enough to remember the 2007 World Cup - I remember what it did for the country then, and I know what it would do now.\" (Reporting by Jack Tarrant Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "description": "TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Springboks captain Siya Kolisi knows what an impact winning the Rugby World Cup can have on his country, having seen how uplifting...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
