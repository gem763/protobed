Even the original portcullis has been given a 21st century touch, as it is now electronically operated.\n\nThe highly unusual property is in Lincombe Drive, Torquay - the south coast town that was home to the hotel in TV comedy Fawlty Towers - and is currently for sale for \u00a31.5million via Absolute Sales and Lettings.\n\nThe modern property is in Devon's Torquay and is currently on the market with an asking price of \u00a31.5million\n\nThe original portcullis has been brought into the 21st century touch and is now electronically operated\n\nThe four-bedroom detached house is called Lincombe Keep and was built using Somerset stone to blend in with its stunning Grade II listed surroundings.\n\nThe estate agent explained that the property is in 'one of Torquay's most exclusive residential areas'.\n\nThe listed walls were built in the style of a castle in the early 20th century by Frederik Harrild, an ex-pupil of famed architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.\n\nThe detached house is called Lincombe Keep and was built using Somerset stone to match the Grade II listed boundary walls\n\nThe interior design reflects the true age of the property, which was completed in 1992\n\nMuch older: The grounds of the Devon property and the boundary walls are Grade II listed\n\nUnique features: A sculptured dragon gargoyle feeds a fountain pool in the Grade II listed gardens\n\nThe beige and pink interiors include decorative pillars and elaborate curtain drapes\n\nThe property is approached via the portcullis, with a path leading to the double front doors.\n\nThere is a spacious split level reception hallway leading to the upper and lower ground floors.\n\nThe upper level includes a living room with uninterrupted sea views and a private sun terrace.\n\nThe grounds were originally designed by Harrild, who was based in Totnes and a former pupil of the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.\n\nThe grounds were formerly attached to a property in Oxlea Road called 'Castle Tor'.\n\nThe new house (Lincombe Keep) was built in the south-east corner of the site to the designs of John Pritchard in 1989-92.\n\nThe modern building takes its inspiration from a medieval castle dating back centuries\n\nThere are four large bedrooms at the house, with this one having enough room for sofas\n\nThe view across the garden and out to sea is framed by topiary birds and clipped boxed hedges\n\nThere are far-reaching views from inside of the modern and comfortable home\n\nIn its advertising material, the estate agent explains that the modern home was designed by John Pritchard Architects.\n\nIt claimed: 'Every detail of the grounds, from the fine wrought iron railings and a gate leading to a sculptured dragon gargoyle that feeds a fountain pool close to the tower, reveals a close attention to design and knowledge of traditional craft techniques.'\n\nThe average price of a property in Torquay is \u00a3242,015, according to property website Zoopla, which compares to a typical value of a home in Britain of \u00a3312,138.\n\nWhat an entrance! A path leads to the double front doors, made from hardwood\n\nThe grounds were formerly attached to a property called 'Castle Tor' and include an original garden turret\n\nBeyond the castellated exterior walls is a spectacular view of the sea on the picturesque south Devon coast\n\nThe gardens were originally created to provide a castle like fairy tale with the abundance of stone statues\n\nThere is a strong architectural character that runs throughout the grounds of the house\n\nLincombe Keep offers a commanding position above Ilsham Valley and Meadfoot Beach\n\nThere is a pattern of rectangular stepping stones leading to an impressive Orangery\n\nThe extensive grounds at Lincombe Keep provide plenty of space to sit and take in the views\n\nThe local estate agent says the property is in 'one of Torquay's most exclusive residential areas'\n\nThe living room includes wooden flooring and a decorative fireplace\n\nZoopla's Annabel Dixon said: 'Calling all Game of Thrones fans. If you harbour a desire to be master of your own castle, turn your attention to the English Riviera.\n\n'With its castellated walls and portcullis, not to mention stone statues, canal-style pond and dragon gargoyle, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Lincombe Keep harks back centuries.\n\n'But this property was in fact built less than 30 years ago in Torquay, the seaside resort that provided the backdrop to the comedy series Fawlty Towers.\n\n'While it may be a modern property, Lincombe Keep has got pedigree. The Grade II-listed grounds were originally designed by Fred Harrild, who was believed to be a pupil of famed architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.'\n\nThe average price of a property in Torquay is significantly lower at \u00a3242,015, according to Zoopla\n\nThe well-maintained gardens stretch across almost half an acre of land", "description": "While the grounds and boundary walls of the property in Torquay are Grade II listed, the four-bedroom house was completed in 1992.", "authors": ["Myra Butterworth For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/13/14/13440492-0-image-a-97_1557754115460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-15"}
