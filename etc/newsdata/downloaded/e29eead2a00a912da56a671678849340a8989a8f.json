Five hours after they had begun their deliberations, they finally emerged in a state of \u201cjoyful mutiny\u201d to announce that they had decided to break with convention, throw out the rule book and anoint two winners rather than the usual one.\n\nBy happy coincidence, Bernardine Evaristo is the same age that Margaret Atwood was when, in 2000, she first won the Booker prize with The Blind Assassin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve both got curly hair,\u201d quipped Atwood as they took to the stage arm in arm. They talk about it again the following morning, comparing notes about hair etiquette and handy products for curls. \u201cPeople used to review my hair back in the day,\u201d says Atwood.\n\nAt first glance, the two prizewinning novels seem worlds apart. Evaristo\u2019s Girl, Woman, Other is a polyphonic look at the lives of 12 black British women that spans the past 100 years, while Atwood\u2019s The Testaments plunges us back into Gilead, the totalitarian state she created in 1985, when Evaristo was a radical lesbian theatremaker still in her 20s. Did the younger woman read The Handmaid\u2019s Tale when it first came out?\n\n\u201cObviously I knew about it, because lots of women around me had read it,\u201d says Evaristo, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t read it until the late 90s because I was reading African American women in my 20s, as they were the ones who I needed to read: Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Audre Lorde. They\u2019re the ones who spoke to me. But when I did read it, I just thought it was a fantastic, chilling story. And so powerfully feminist.\u201d\n\nBoth winning novels continue that feminist tradition, though both could also be seen to contain critiques of it. In The Testaments, as in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, women are oppressed by women \u2013 notably the scary Aunt Lydia \u2013 while in Girl, Woman, Other, the teenage Yazz dismisses her mother as a feminazi: \u201cTo be honest, even being a woman is pass\u00e9 these days,\u201d she sneers.\n\nPlay Video 2:11 Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo jointly awarded Booker Prize \u2013 video\n\nBoth authors laugh: \u201cSo, yeah, she\u2019s a teenager,\u201d says Evaristo. \u201cOf course she has to counter the mom,\u201d agrees Atwood. \u201cAnd, in fact, the same thing happened in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale back in 1985. Offred has this feminist mom of the 60s and 70s who she considers really extreme and pass\u00e9, and her mother keeps saying: \u2018Just you wait.\u2019\u201d\n\nYazz\u2019s mother is Amma, who is a theatremaker, as Evaristo once was. We meet the character on the eve of her big success \u2013 a premiere of her play The Last Amazon of Dahomey, at the National Theatre \u2013 but the novel traces her back to a 1980s London of squats and lesbian collectives. How autobiographical is it all?\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a version of my younger self,\u201d confirms Evaristo. \u201cI wanted to write about that 1980s era of, particularly, black women feminists who were creating art together, who felt like outsiders in society and who were very brave and also very confrontational \u2013 you know, because that was a very confrontational era. I used to heckle; Amma heckles. And Amma is lesbian. And I was lesbian in the 80s.\n\n\u201cA lot of the women creating theatre and art and dance and so on were lesbian or bisexual and working in a quite segregated way, but feeling empowered by each other \u2013 not having to explain themselves to other people, not feeling that they needed to bring men in. Then, I think, a lot of people reach a stage where they no longer need that; and also sexuality changes; my own sexuality changed.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernardine Evaristo performing in the 1980s. Photograph: @BernadineEvari/Twitter\n\nEvaristo was the fourth of eight children born to an English mother and a Nigerian father in south-east London in 1959. Although Atwood grew up in Canada 20 years earlier and spent her early childhood running wild during field trips with her entomologist father, there are similarities in their upbringings, not least in the traditional attitudes to gender in schools. \u201cIn the 50s and early 60s, girls took home economics, boys took woodwork and never the twain would meet,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cThat\u2019s the education I had. But, since I grew up in the woods and had a tomboy mother, who was not interested in those things at all, it didn\u2019t take on me.\u201d Evaristo says: \u201cI went to a girls grammar school and did domestic science, and my brothers did woodwork or whatever they called it.\u201d\n\nBoth women grew up in the heydey of the nuclear family, and their novels are an examination of less conventional families. \u201cI have a gay man and a gay woman who raise a child separately; they\u2019re not living together. I wanted to present a sort of queer family,\u201d says Evaristo. \u201cAmma has a support network around her; she chooses lots of people to be godparents so that she always has babysitters, for example.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she adds, \u201cin the black British community, there is a bit of an issue with single-parent families \u2013 women raising children on their own. I do have one woman in the book who is raising her children on her own because her man is going off. But I also have some nuclear families.\u201d\n\nThe nuclear family, Atwood chips in, was part of the burden of the 20th century. \u201cIn the 19th century, families were very extended. And then it became nuclear, which was actually very hard on women because they were expected to be in this house all by themselves with their Hoover and their washing machine. And that was supposed to be enough, but it meant that they didn\u2019t have any support.\n\n\u201cSo I think extended families and families that you make, rather than those you are handed on a plate, give people much more support. And, for instance, if you go to indigenous society, you will find a lot more generational support. So, grandmothers and elders are pretty important.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Atwood with her novel The Blind Assassin, which won the Booker prize in 2000.

Aunt Lydia could hardly be described as a positive role model, Atwood agrees, \u201cbut all occupying forces raise a contingent from within the people being oppressed to do the controlling, because it\u2019s more effective and a lot cheaper. So of course they would raise a contingent of women. And so it has been throughout colonial history. As I say, nothing went into the book that didn\u2019t have precedent in real life. Somebody reading the original Handmaid\u2019s Tale once said: \u2018This book was just like my girls school.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s nuns, you know \u2026\u201d\n\nIn Evaristo\u2019s world, three of the strongest and most endearing women are elderly. \u201cI really wanted to write an intergenerational novel, and to have women at every stage in their lives. I wanted them all to have their faculties intact and to be, to a certain extent, enjoying their lives and enjoying their independence.\n\n\u201cOlder women don\u2019t really feature much in fiction, which is such a shame, because we\u2019re actually much more interesting than younger women, because we\u2019ve lived full lives. But when young women write older women, they\u2019re usually mad!\u201d\n\nAtwood nods. \u201cWhen I went to the US right after the Trump election, these younger women were saying: \u2018This is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened.\u2019 No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. Many worse things have happened.\n\n\u201cI also say that if your heart is broken when you\u2019re 18, by 28, you\u2019ve got some perspective; at 38, you\u2019ll probably think it\u2019s funny. And when you\u2019re my age, you cannot remember who it was who broke your heart.\u201d\n\nWhich brings both writers to their own ages. \u201cAm I middle-aged now?\u201d wonders Evaristo, who was at the Booker ceremony with her husband, whom she met on a dating site 13 years ago. \u201cYou know,\u201d she ponders, \u201cthere\u2019s this myth that old people don\u2019t have energy. I think that if you look after yourself, you have energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d adds Atwood, \u201cyou often have more energy, because it isn\u2019t going into the things it goes into when you\u2019re younger such as\u201d \u2013 she breaks into a loud stage whisper \u2013 \u201chormonal changes every month. There\u2019s a middle period when you\u2019re taking care of everybody \u2013 your kids, your parents \u2013 and you are really stretched. Then, as you get older, bad things happen, people die, but you are no longer caregiving to such an extent.\u201d\n\nWhat I find is that when young women write older women, they\u2019re usually mad\n\nRole models are key, says Evaristo. \u201cIt\u2019s good for younger women to see older women who are leading fulfilled lives. I had a friend who was in her 90s who had been movement tutor at my drama school. And she was still teaching into her late 80s, working in Europe and running workshops. And she always had plans.\n\n\u201cIt was so important for me to show that ageing is something to be welcomed and enjoyed. Because what can you do about it? I know that sounds really idealistic, but that\u2019s what I try to tell myself, especially now that I\u2019m 60.\u201d\n\nThe forms that both women have chosen to express all these themes are also energetic. \u201cWell,\u201d says Atwood drily, \u201cwhen you have totalitarianism, you\u2019re going to have a lot of plot, because totalitarianism generates plots. And I don\u2019t mean just the plot of the novel.\u201d\n\nEvaristo writes in a style which she calls \u201cfusion fiction\u201d. \u201cI wanted to tell 12 women\u2019s stories, so I had to find a form to fit that. It\u2019s kind of patterned on the page, a bit like poetry, and there were very few full stops, but there are gaps between the lines that indicate some kind of breathing spaces. It allowed me to write each woman\u2019s story in a way that was inside their heads and outside. And also to go back into the past and forward to the present.\u201d\n\nAlthough she has not written a play since the 80s, Evaristo acknowledges theatre\u2019s influence on her work and says she is hoping to go back to it. When I wonder what influence the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale has had on Atwood\u2019s work, Evaristo points out that diversity quotas in casting have literally altered the complexion of Gilead. We also know that the TV series of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale introduced the character of the missing baby Nicole, whose wherebouts is a central mystery in The Testaments.\n\nAtwood doesn\u2019t disagree: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion of the TV series, that they didn\u2019t go the whole hog \u2013 because they would then have sent all the black people off to national homelands, as the South Africans did during apartheid. Perhaps North Dakota. I don\u2019t know what you know about North Dakota, but it\u2019s an inhospitable place to have a national homeland.\u201d\n\nDoes television change the sort of stories that are told? \u201cIt changes the way stories are seen,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cIt\u2019s not like radio, where you can\u2019t actually tell what colour the person is. If The Handmaid\u2019s Tale were on radio, it wouldn\u2019t work. You wouldn\u2019t have all these protesters dressed as handmaids. It\u2019s very visual.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Evaristo, \u201cI think, in terms of TV drama and stage drama cross-casting, as they call it, has been incredible. Especially recently. For example, Adjoa Andoh, a friend of mine, recently played Richard II at the Globe.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sharing hope for the future: Evaristo and Atwood lock arms. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nBoth novels end on a note of optimism. Does this reflect the writers\u2019 own attitudes. \u201cWhat we think of as a family has changed,\u201d says Atwood. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big fight in in North America and especially for gay people. But we have gay marriage now.\u201d\n\nEvaristo shakes her head. \u201cI think we\u2019re in difficult political times. I normally have a very positive perspective on everything. But, at the moment, I find it very hard to have a positive perspective on the political climate in this country, let alone anywhere else.\n\n\u201cBut with the characters I did not want to present 12 black women who are defeated by life, even though that is sometimes the case. So there is definitely hope in each of their narratives without it getting saccharine.\u201d\n\nAtwood agrees: \u201cA pessimistic ending would be you kill everybody off. The ending of The Testaments is not optimistic for everybody in the story, but it does signal the beginning of the end. Or as Churchill said: \u2018This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\u2019 Maybe the end of the beginning is optimistic enough under the circumstances.\u201d", "description": "The judges staged a \u2018joyful mutiny\u2019 to name the pair joint winners of the literary prize.
