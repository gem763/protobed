Speaking with media ahead of the Dolphins Week 3 game against the Cowboys, Grier described Tunsil coming into his office and seeing the proposed trade on the board.\n\n\"A funny story I was saying the other day was I called Laremy about the trade, and Laremy walked in my office and saw it on the board and goes, 'I would trade me for that,'\" said Grier, per USA Today.\n\nThree weeks into the season, it looks as though both sides have gotten what they wanted out of the deal. The Dolphins are off to an 0-3 start, but have two first-round picks (2020 and 2021) and a second-round pick (2021) from the Texans to help them rebuild over the next few years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Texans have started the season 2-1, and look likely to contend for the AFC South title throughout the season and hopefully earn a spot in the postseason.\n\nIt's likely never easy for a young player to learn he's about to be traded, but when you see as big a price on the board as Tunsil did, it's not that hard to understand the deal.\n\nTop 14 waiver-wire pickups for Week 4 of fantasy football\n\nGiants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones reportedly blew away teammates with a profane message before leading the team to an impressive first win\n\nBucs head coach took an intentional penalty because he wanted a longer game-winning field goal - and the kicker missed\n\nLamar Jackson embarrassed a defender with a simple juke", "description": "Laremy Tunsil wasn't shocked to learn the Dolphins were trading him after seeing the massive offer from the Texans.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d89173d2e22af1bc6319ae9-2560-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
