You just wear it and let it suckle \u2014 everything else is done with the smart app, which tells you how much you pump during each session in real time and keeps a running log of all your past sessions. Once I got the hang of it, the Willow yielded the most milk for me in the shortest amount of time, and isn\u2019t that the ultimate goal of pumping? I felt I could do almost anything while wearing it \u2014 brush my teeth, sit at my computer, wash dishes \u2014 and it was really easy to use on the go, like on an airplane or in a car (as long as I wore a poncho over it). I\u2019m busty, so it wasn\u2019t as discreet on me as the company advertises it to be, but I imagine if you had smaller boobs it would be even easier to camouflage. I work from home, but for returning-to-work mamas, this is a great choice. You wouldn\u2019t even have to go to a pumping room.\n\nCons: The Willow can be super-wasteful because each time you pump, you have to use one of its own milk-storage products \u2014 on each side! When you buy the pump, the included storage products are nonreusable bags (that retail for $11 for a 24-pack). Sometimes I was pumping just to feed my kid immediately, and it was annoying to have to use two bags that I instantly threw away. But the company just launched reusable milk containers for the Willow 2.0 that are sold separately and don\u2019t require bags. If you have the system, you can buy the new containers, then pump either into them, allowing you to pour milk out immediately, or into the bags, if you want to save and/or freeze the milk. The Willow is uncomfortable \u2014 there\u2019s a definite pinching \u2014 but for the speed and ease, I felt that was a fair trade-off. It was also the hardest to clean because the parts are weirdly shaped and sized, and it needs its own specific charger (for some reason, it comes with only one, so you can\u2019t charge both pumps at the same time). You also can\u2019t skip the \u201cstimulation mode\u201d that primes the breast for pumping; you have to wait until the pump uses its \u201ctechnology\u201d to determine that you are done with stimulation and ready to move on to expression. For day-to-day, though, the Willow was my go-to for speed.", "description": "One writer tested the breast quiet breast pumps on the market to find the best version for being discreet and wearable and quiet.
