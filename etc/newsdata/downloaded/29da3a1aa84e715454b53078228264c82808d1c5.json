We were told it by everyone and I said that right from the beginning and no one chose to listen to me and that is why we failed.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouleyman went on to explain who he thought should have been fired instead of him.\n\nHe added: \u2018The people responsible for the toy was Thomas and his team because they made the toy, and Riyonn because he was the project manager,\n\n\u2018He has made toys in the past but for some reason he completely detached himself from the project and he just wanted to have fun on stage in front of the camera and that\u2019s unfortunately where I got picked on, despite me making credible points about the product.\n\n\u2018Tommy or Riyonn should have been fired because they were the ones put in charge.\u2019\n\nSouleyman has left the show after three weeks(Picture: PA)\n\nHaving been diagnosed with Retina Pigmentosa at age six, Souleyman also said during the challenge that he felt \u2018picked on\u2019 by his fellow teammates.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know why they used my valid points and twisted them to get me fired,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018When I did get fired Lord Sugar said to me that it was \u201cbrave\u201d of me to come on the show as a \u201cbig leap of ambition\u201d. I felt really patronised by that comment because having a disability people say that to us every day like, \u201coh you\u2019re so brave\u201d and I just felt that undermined everything I had done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was picked from 70,000 people and made it to the final 16 people. I felt very belittled and patronised and he has never said that to anyone before so I thought that was unfair.\u2019\n\nThe Apprentice continues Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
