Justice Department lawyer Kathryn Wyer said in a two-page filing that the administration would \"voluntarily agree ... to preserve the material at issue,\" The Washington Post reported.\n\nJust a day later, Jackson issued the directive ordering the White House to preserve a host of communications between Trump and foreign leaders.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.\n\nTrump is facing intensifying scrutiny over revelations about his efforts to encourage Ukraine to investigate 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump criticizes supposed second whistleblower North Korea missile test raises fears of new capabilities Trump told House Republicans that he made Ukraine call because of Perry: Report MORE and his son. A whistleblower complaint accusing Trump of a broad effort to enlist the foreign nation's help in his 2020 reelection campaign contributed to a formal impeachment inquiry in the House.\n\nThe complaint focuses in part on allegations about the White House's actions with regard to Trump's conversation with foreign leaders. Among other things, the complaint alleges that senior White House officials intervened to \u201clock down\u201d records of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. It also claims that White House officials were told by White House lawyers to move the electronic transcript onto a separate computer system \u201cthat is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.\u201d\n\nThis report was updated at 8:58 a.m.", "description": "A federal judge has ordered the White House to preserve records of President Trump's \"meetings, phone calls, and other communications with foreign leaders,\" a move that comes as the president faces a formal impeachment inquiry over his interaction", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419as9_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
