The suit alleged that Spacey had sexually assaulted the plaintiff, who remained anonymous, by forcing him to grab Spacey\u2019s genitals twice during a private massage at the actor\u2019s Malibu home.\n\nSpacey had requested the case be dismissed due to the victim\u2019s shielded identity, but a federal judged moved it forward in May. In August, the parties agreed the case would move to trial, but the plaintiff\u2019s attorney announced that the client had \u201crecently passed.\u201d No details about the plaintiff\u2019s death have been revealed. The lawsuit could be continued by the the plaintiff\u2019s heirs, but loss of the key witness would make the charges difficult to litigate. The victim\u2019s wish for anonymity \u2014 a common request out of a concern for safety and privacy \u2014 would likely be compromised, too.\n\nAllegations against Spacey first surfaced in October 2017, at the outset of the #MeToo movement. Actor Anthony Rapp claimed that Spacey had made advances on him when he was 14. Spacey denied allegations on Twitter, apologized to Rapp, and came out as gay.\n\nOver the next few years, dozens more allegations surfaced, ranging from forceful groping to indecent exposure to sexual assault, oftentimes from men who were very young or minors at the time of the incidents. During the fallout, Spacey was removed from his lead role in Netflix\u2019s House of Cards, and was replaced by Christopher Plummer in the film All the Money in the World. Spacey has denied any wrongdoing, most notably in a bizarre video in which he plays his House of Cards character, Frank Underwood.", "description": "An anonymous massage therapist who claimed Spacey sexually assaulted him in 2016 died before they were set to appear in court.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/18/18-kevin-spacey.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
