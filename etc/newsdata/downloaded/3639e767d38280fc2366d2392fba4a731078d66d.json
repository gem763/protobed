So palpable, in fact, that several journalists were scolded for trying to duck out early.\n\nThe British Prime Minister concluded his remarks with several platitudes in which he described the UK as \u201ca quintessential European country\u2026 solid European friends, neighbors, and supporters\u201d before signing off and thanking all those present.\n\nNo sooner had he finished than the assembled press corps apparently bolted for the door, much to the European Commission president\u2019s dismay, as evidenced by his repeated shouts for attention. \u201cHey! Hey! Hey!,\u201d he can be heard bellowing over the din of excited editors and correspondents exiting the room.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 'Jean Claude's the boss here!'\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson's caught off guard as he finishes his speech but @JunckerEU's not ready to give up the mic quite yet... \ud83c\udfa4\n\n\n\nThe EU & UK have now agreed a #BrexitDeal: https://t.co/1qMqsK6z0epic.twitter.com/TjptgA294I \u2014 RT UK (@RTUKnews) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cJean Claude\u2019s the boss here,\u201d Johnson chimed in, before once again giving the floor to Juncker.\n\nMuch like a teacher who knows they\u2019ve lost the class\u2019s attention, Juncker gave a half-hearted closing remark before finally dismissing the giddy group of reporters, who apparently couldn\u2019t flee fast enough.\n\n\u201cI have to say that I\u2019m happy about the deal but I\u2019m sad about Brexit. Have a good time,\u201d Juncker said, finally wrapping things up.\n\nAlso on rt.com Brexit deal has been struck - Johnson and Juncker announce 'fair and balanced' agreement\n\nLike this story?
