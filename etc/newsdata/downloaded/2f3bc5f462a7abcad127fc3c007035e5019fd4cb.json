The first iPhone SE, which was unveiled in 2016, also went on sale in late March.\n\nThe iPhone XR (pictured above) is among Apple's newest 'budget' offerings, despite retailing at a rather hefty $599. A rumored iPhone SE 2 is anticipated to cost $399\n\nA more specific release date follows several other details released forecast by Kuo, including a price tag that makes the phone a full $300 less than Apple's newly release premium device, the iPhone 11.\n\nKuo says the next iteration Apple's iPhone SE will cost $399 and come in three distinct colors and two storage tiers - a 64 GB version and a 128 GB version.\n\nColors are expected to include space gray, silver, and product red, according to 9to5Mac.\n\nThe iPhone SE 2 will reportedly be similar to the design of the iPhone 8 but will come with Apple's newest processor, the A13 Bionic - the same chip included in both new iPhone 11's - despite having 1GB less RAM than Apple's premium models.\n\nKuo says the phones will likely be positioned as a way to entice iPhone owners still using the company's older models, particularly the iPhone 6 and 6s, who cannot afford the company's $700 iPhone 11.\n\nOn top of a new budget phone, Kuo has also forecast that Apple will be partnering with 'third-party brands' to sell it's first-ever augmented reality headset.\n\nApple has long been rumored to be developing its own pair of AR glasses. The tech giant has filed a patent this year that gives a glimpse into what it may be developing behind closed doors\n\nThere's still no word on exactly what form the headset will take or whether it will fall closer to Facebook's glasses on the spectrum or something bulkier like Microsoft's Hololens.\n\nKuo has also referenced the possibility of a new iPad Pro which could come equipped with 3D sensor similar to a True-Depth feature in iPhones.\n\nThis feature allows the device to capture more of the environment around subjects in photos and video and could help future efforts at improving augmented reality experiences on the device.", "description": "The potential release would coincide with Apple's past product launch schedule for more affordable devices.
