Days Later They Arrested Him.", "language": "en", "text": "When Houston immigration activist Roland Gramajo Reyes invited U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to a public meeting for people worried about being arrested due to their immigration status, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d end up behind bars.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nGramajo\u2019s longtime advocacy on behalf of Houston\u2019s immigrant and Latino communities, family, attorney, and allies said, make them seriously doubt that the timing of his apprehension was an accident.\n\nNow, Gramajo, 40, is caught in a tug-of-war between law enforcement agencies seeking to either deport him after 25 cumulative years in the United States, or to first incarcerate him for improper entry into the United States, a charge that could land him in prison.\n\nHandout More\n\n\u201cHis bond was denied Monday by a federal judge, so he will remain in detention while his illegal reentry charges are resolved,\u201d Raed Gonzalez, Gramajo\u2019s attorney, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe are trying to reopen his immigration case\u2026 Many hurdles await us, but we are trying our best.\u201d\n\nGramajo, a father of five and grandfather of two, was born in Retalhuleu, Guatemala in 1979, and first moved to Houston at age 15. Since then, he has made the improvement of the Guatemalan community and his adopted hometown his life\u2019s mission.\n\nHe founded the Centro Organizativo Guatemalteco, which raises funds for humanitarian causes in Guatemala, as well as the Southwest American Systems Chamber of Commerce, which helps minority children participate in sports and beauty pageants. After Hurricane Harvey devastated the city in 2017, he took weeks off work to organize community efforts in helping those affected by the storm\u2019s flooding that caused an estimated $125 billion in damage. For his work, Gramajo has received commendations from a host of state and local organizations, including the Alief Independent School District, Houston Community College, the Golden Eagle Society, and the Houston City Council.\n\nOnly days before his apprehension by ICE, Gramajo had organized a \u201cknow your rights\u201d seminar for undocumented immigrants and their families in the city\u2014the seminar to which he had invited immigration agents to participate. That invitation, Gramajo\u2019s defenders believe, may have unintentionally goaded ICE into looking into Gramajo\u2019s immigration status, a charge ICE has called \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be abundantly clear, ICE personnel did not attend this Immigration Forum in any capacity\u2014official or unofficial,\u201d the agency released in a statement last week, saying that Gramajo became a target after ICE received an anonymous tip about his status. \u201cTo portray him in one-sided media reports\u2026 as a victim of some \u2018covert\u2019 law enforcement operation is an insulting affront to public safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna be able to comment any further on the anonymous tip\u201d that led to Gramajo\u2019s apprehension, ICE spokesperson Tim Oberle told The Daily Beast when asked about the timing of the tip that lead to his arrest, \u201cbecause it\u2019s anonymous, obviously.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of ICE\u2019s deportation case is Gramajo\u2019s 1998 guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of burglary of a vehicle, for which he was sentenced to 20 days in prison. Gramajo\u2019s family told reporters in Houston that the charge was the result of a practical joke that he had played on a friend, the vehicle\u2019s owner.\n\nAfter his plea, immigration authorities commenced deportation proceedings against Gramajo, culminating in his deportation to Guatemala in summer 2004. Gramajo returned months later to be with his family in Houston\u2014including his wife and children\u2014and has remained ever since.", "description": "Smith Collection/Gado/GettyWhen Houston immigration activist Roland Gramajo Reyes invited U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to a public meeting for people worried about being arrested due to their immigration status, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d end up behind bars.He was wrong.\u00a0Gramajo\u2019s longtime", "authors": ["Scott Bixby"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a.N0q_kEidUFIhr7NfWB1A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/916f4980b864364dab73d3849796b1dc", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
