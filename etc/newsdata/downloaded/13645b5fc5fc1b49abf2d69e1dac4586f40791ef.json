Eriksen has sought a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona and has been chief among the Spurs players to whom uncertainty has clung.\n\nAubameyang completes comeback and earns Arsenal draw against Spurs Read more\n\nEriksen opened the scoring before a Harry Kane penalty made it 2-0. Arsenal hit back through Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\n\nPochettino said: \u201cThe most important for us is not the table, not the points, it\u2019s the performance. We have recovered the good feelings after the Newcastle defeat last Sunday and a very tough summer \u2013 all that happened in these last four weeks. I am so optimistic that we have the quality to build again because in our three previous games this season we didn\u2019t show our quality.\n\n\u201cWe need that togetherness. The team wasn\u2019t settled and I told you from day one of pre-season that I wasn\u2019t happy. The most important is to be all on the same page; that the players have a clear idea of how we need to move. Clear minds \u2013 like Christian today and different players. Tomorrow [when the window shuts] they are going to be only focused, 100%, in Tottenham \u2013 not thinking different things that make management so difficult.\u201d\n\nPochettino was asked whether Eriksen would definitely stay. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it is impossible [for him to leave] but it is going to be difficult. The most important is that it\u2019s only 24 hours [to go].\u201d\n\nKane went down under a stoppage-time challenge from Sokratis and felt that Spurs should have had a second penalty to win the game. The striker looked to have initiated the contact himself but refuted the suggestion he had dived.\n\n\u201cAs a striker, if it is on halfway, it is a definite foul,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIn the box you don\u2019t always get them. He\u2019s come through the back of me but it is 50/50. VAR would probably have backed the ref in this.\u201d\n\nUnai Emery could enjoy a thrilling attacking performance from his Arsenal team but lamented the mistakes that led to the Spurs goals. Sokratis erred in the buildup to the first, which also featured a soft Bernd Leno attempt to save, while Granit Xhaka conceded the penalty with a reckless tackle.\n\n\u201cWe played more with our hearts than our heads for the first half,\u201d Emery said. \u201cAnd the second is frustration after the first goal. At 2-0 down, we can be proud of our response. We deserved more. There were more positives than negatives in the 90 minutes.\u201d", "description": "The Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino said he was happy with his players\u2019 reaction to their Newcastle defeat and hinted Christian Eriksen will stay at the club", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f4aa5bbd84f52bca3ce9947c519136528d89e0/0_144_3088_1853/master/3088.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=da3ed25a4543b57f597aec188e6122f6"}
