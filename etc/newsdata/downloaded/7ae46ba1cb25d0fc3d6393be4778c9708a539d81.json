And now it seems like the ruthless doctor\u2019s crime will escape completely unnoticed this year as actress Rebecca Sarker revealed her Christmas scripts have no signs of her sticky fingers.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk on the Inside Soap Awards red carpet, Rebecca told us: \u2018I\u2019ve got a feeling that she might have got away with it, I really do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got new scripts coming through and starting to film and I know I\u2019m in one of the Christmas stories but there\u2019s no hint of it.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s either gotten away with it or it\u2019s going to rear its ugly head [next year].\u2019\n\nManpreet stole from Derek after he died (Picture: ITV)\n\nWe know that secrets never stay buried in soapland though, so we won\u2019t be too surprised if it all catches up with her in 2020.\n\nTeasing what\u2019s in store over the festive period, Rebecca continued: \u2018All the scripts are hot off the press and I\u2019ve literally just got them through the post so I don\u2019t know if I can say much, but it is a fun storyline.\u2019\n\nHooray, we need some Christmas cheer in the Dales to look forward to what with Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley) and Aaron Dingle (Danny Miller) fleeing the village and Moira Barton\u2019s (Natalie J Robb) affair.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
