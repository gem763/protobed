By 2015, the paper was producing a print edition only once a week.\n\nMeanwhile, Madigan said, digital readership has \u201cnever been stronger.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDbknews.com attracted more than 160,000 unique visitors in September, Brennan said. Only about 5,000 newspapers are picked up each week.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFive-thousand is great, but 160,000 is definitely better,\u201d Brennan, a senior, said. \u201cWe want readers to read our content.\u201d\n\nAt its peak \u2014 from 1979 into the 1990s \u2014 the Diamondback was printing 20,000 newspapers a day, Madigan said.\n\nJessie Campisi, who graduated from the university in 2018, called the announcement a blow. She wrote and edited for the Diamondback\u2019s news section.\n\n\u201cIt makes me sad to think that something that was a tradition and a mainstay of such a significant news source and such a foundational piece of the University of Maryland and the journalism school is going to be gone,\u201d said Campisi, a social media curator at the Hill. \u201cIt makes sense financially and media industry-wise, but personally, you feel like you\u2019re losing a bit of history.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWeekday print circulation among U.S. daily newspapers fell 27 percent between 2000 and 2014, from more than 55 million copies to just over 40 million, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Estimated total daily newspaper circulation in 2018 was 28.6 million.\n\nAD\n\nNewspaper editors at Syracuse University, the University of Nebraska, Columbia University, Cornell University and other schools have also scaled back printing operations. Last year, staff at Syracuse University\u2019s the Daily Orange announced they would print four days a week, instead of five. The move saved $30,000 in printing-related costs, general manager Mike Dooling said at the time.\n\nThe Diamondback has led coverage on national stories, including the death of Maryland football player Jordan McNair and the ensuing scandal that ensnared university officials. Student journalists earlier this year reported on the death of a freshman who contracted an adenovirus infection, raising concerns about the conditions of on-campus housing. University officials came under fire for waiting more than two weeks to inform the community after learning the virus was present on campus.\n\nAD\n\nKevin Robillard, a senior political reporter at HuffPost who worked at the Diamondback while attending U-Md., said he\u2019s worried about what future students will miss out on when the print edition is gone.\n\nAD\n\nHe called the print publication a cultural artifact that marks athletic victories and other significant events.\n\nAnd he\u2019s worried about the reporters. There\u2019s professional experience to be gained by putting out a newspaper, said Robillard, who was on the staff of the Diamondback from 2006 to 2010.\n\n\u201cThe paper has to come out every day, and if there\u2019s no news, you kind of have to find the news. It doesn\u2019t allow you to take a day off, it doesn\u2019t allow you to slack off,\u201d Robillard said. \u201cThat, I think, is really good training. I worry that they\u2019ll lose some of that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe student newspaper was named the Triangle when it launched in 1910, but changed its name in 1921 to recognize the university\u2019s mascot: the diamondback terrapin. It has been financially independent since 1971, when the board that governs the school\u2019s finances cut the publication\u2019s funding after students printed blank pages to protest the Vietnam War, the Diamondback reported.\n\nAD\n\nBrennan and Madigan said they expect that print advertisers will follow readers online and will keep the publication afloat.\n\nThe Diamondback will still publish print versions of popular tabloids, such as the back-to-school Survival Guide and commemorative Senior Edition, which serves as a send-off for graduates, Brennan said.\n\nAD\n\nEven though the print version of the Diamondback will be a memory by springtime, Brennan said the staff will continue to deliver the news readers have always expected from the paper.\n\n\u201cWe go after the stories no one else does because we\u2019re the local media in College Park,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cWe take pride in our work.\u201d\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "The Diamondback will stop its print edition and become an online-only publication.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "Reporting Fellow Focusing On Local Education Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zdbUl-cbWotjL9CdEWRdXIgWtEk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KWGZK3W3UQI6PISBBBEDCVSC2A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
