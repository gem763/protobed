The Ministry of Justice must implement its new reforms without delay. Preventing homicide by criminals under state supervision must be a priority.\"\n\nVictims rights campaigner, Harry Fletcher, added: \"These are shocking statistics - a rise of over 60 per cent in reviews into murders where the alleged perpetrator is on parole or supervision defies belief. Yet again, victims are ignored by the criminal justice system.\"\n\nCharities say the findings are an \"urgent wake up call\" that the probation system needs to be overhauled.\n\nSandra Horley CBE, chief executive of national domestic abuse charity Refuge, said women and children are at particular risk at the hands of ex-partners who have a history of violence.\n\n\"The recent domestic homicide statistics should serve as a wake up call to politicians and the criminal justice system,\" she said.\n\n\"Two women per week in England and Wales are killed by their current or former partner. Reform is desperately needed. Women\u2019s lives depend on it.\u201d\n\nAdina Clare, acting co-chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, agreed that the probation system is not fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cThese are shocking findings which should be an urgent wake up call on the scale of the challenge within the current probation system,\" she said.\n\n\"Early releases of offenders, particularly when a victim is not provided with robust safeguards and ongoing support, can and do put women at further risk.\n\n\"A safe probation response to domestic abuse cases can be a matter of life and death for survivors.\"\n\nAmong the offenders who have slipped through probation's net are Leroy Campbell, 57, who raped and murdered nurse Lisa Skidmore in her own home four months after being released on licence in 2016.\n\nSix weeks before he climbed into the bedroom of the Wolverhampton property with a ladder, he had told the probation service he was \"noticing open windows\" and thinking about rape, but no steps were taken to recall him to prison.\n\nMarvyn Iheanacho, 41, who beat his girlfriend's five-year-old son Alex Malcolm to death for losing his trainer in a south London park, had a catalogue of previous convictions for violence against ex-girlfriends.\n\nAlex's mother was not aware of Iheanacho's violent past and he broke the conditions of his licence - which included not having unsupervised contact with under-16s - with impunity.", "description": "Almost a fifth of murders in England and Wales are now committed by people who are on parole, shocking new figures reveal today.", "authors": ["Martin Evans", "Phoebe Southworth", "Crime Correspondent", "David Trimble", "Roderick Crawford", "Stephen Barclay"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000209072213-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
