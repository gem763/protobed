That sent the stock BYND, +11.58% surging 12% on heavy volume in afternoon trading.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Beyond Meat\u2019s stock soars after McDonald\u2019s unveils test of company-made P.L.T. burgers.\n\nJefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said this partnership has the potential to significantly boost Beyond Meat\u2019s (BYND) sales, if it is eventually rolled out beyond the testing phase to McDonald\u2019s 38,000 restaurants worldwide.\n\nGrundy said if Beyond Meat\u2019s patties pass the test, and they eventually account for 1% to 6% of McDonald\u2019s beef volume in the U.S., it could add anywhere from $50 million to $285 million to Beyond Meat\u2019s annual sales.\n\nWhile McDonald\u2019s MCD, -0.01% announcement \u201cis what bulls have been waiting for,\u201d Grundy said he can\u2019t recommend buying the stock as valuation keeps him on the sidelines. He reiterated the hold rating he\u2019s had on stock since he initiated coverage, and kept his stock price target at $152, which is almost 2% below current levels.\n\nD.A. Davidson\u2019s Brian Holland wrote in a recent note to clients that a Beyond Meat-McDonald\u2019s announcement wouldn\u2019t change his bearish view on the stock. His concerns that valuations overstate the total addressable market for plant-based meats is what made him rate the stock underperform, with a $130 stock price target.\n\nOf the 11 analysts surveyed by FactSet that cover Beyond Meat, seven are neutral on the stock, two are bullish and two are bearish. The average price target of $150.70 is 2.7% below current levels.\n\nAlthough valuations may already be relatively high, that doesn\u2019t mean the stock can\u2019t keep rallying \u2014 a lot.\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners, said \u201cthere\u2019s a good chance that there will be several million shares of short sellers covering their positions and driving BYND\u2019s stock price even higher.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Short sellers are not evil, but they are misunderstood.\n\nHe said short interest, or bearish bets on Beyond Meat\u2019s stock, as a percentage of float \u2014 shares available to trade \u2014 is about 41.6%. That dwarfed the next-most shorted stocks in the packaged foods and meats sector, as short interest as a percentage of float for Hormel Foods Corp. HRL, +0.55% was 13.9% and for Campbell Soup Co. CPB, +0.30% is 11.6%, according to S3 data.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost to borrow the Beyond Meat stock so they can be sold short was the highest for any stock in the world with more than $50 million worth of short interest, Dusaniwsky said, even before Thursday\u2019s rally.\n\nThe borrow fee on existing Beyond Meat shorts was an annualized 141.1% through Wednesday. The next highest was 73.4% for Zoom Video Communications Inc. shares ZM, +0.19%, followed by 70.4% for PagerDuty Inc. shares PD, +4.05% and 66.4% for Tilray Inc.\u2019s stock TLRY, +0.41%. The borrowing rates for Hormel and Campbell shares was 0.3%.\n\nSo even though short sellers had $164 million in mark-to-market profits in September through Wednesday, they had to pay $68 million in stock borrow financing costs to have those shorts, S3 data showed. And with the stock surging on Thursday, short sellers are suffering mark-to-market losses of an estimated $81 million on the day, and an estimated $731.6 million this year.\n\nThe stock has run up 135% since closing at $65.75 on its first day of trading on May 2. In comparison, the Renaissance IPO exchange-traded fund IPO, -0.79% has lost 7.5% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.24% has gained 2.2% over the same time frame.\n\nThe reason for the high borrowing cost is supply, as virtually all of the lendable stock has already been lent out, Dusaniwsky said. And as those rates keep rising, borrow fees on lots of 1,000 to 25,000 shares were going at between 300% to 400% early Thursday.\n\nAmong the biggest concern for bears, however, isn\u2019t that lendable shares are scarce, it\u2019s that recalls are starting. Basically, bulls who owned shares available for lending have started taking profits, which means the stock bears borrowed so they can short them have to be returned, which requires them to cover their shorts sooner than they may want.\n\n\u201c[W]with market-to-market losses mounting, stock borrow rates accelerating to the upside and stock recalls hitting the Street, the likelihood of a short squeeze is very high,\u201d Dusaniwsky wrote in a research note. \u201cIf BYND\u2019s stock price continues this upward trajectory, this will turn into a \u2018Whopper\u2019 of a short squeeze.\u201d\n\nValuation wasn\u2019t Wall Street\u2019s only concern about Beyond Meat\n\nValuation may have been one of the biggest concerns for Beyond Meat investors, but it wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\nAnother was the company\u2019s ability to meet demand. While the company said in its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has \u201csignificantly expanded\u201d production capacity, \u201cwe may experience a lag in production relative to customer demand if our growth rate exceeds our expectations.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Beyond Meat goes public with a bang: 5 things to know about the plant-based meat maker.\n\nJefferies\u2019 Grundy helped assuage that concern, as he said one of the reasons McDonald\u2019s partnered with Beyond Meat is the company has the \u201cstrong capacity and production capabilities needed to fulfill [McDonald\u2019s] demand if the test run is successful and spurs a nationwide rollout.\u201d\n\nAnother concern is that Beyond Meat doesn\u2019t pass McDonald\u2019s test, after Restaurant Brands International Inc.\u2019s QSR, -0.73% Tim Hortons recently allowed its limited-time offer of Beyond Meat burgers to lapse in some of its restaurants.\n\nBut J.P. Morgan\u2019s Ken Goldman noted recently Beyond Meat\u2019s breakfast sausages were extended at most Tim Hortons through the end of the year. \u201cGiven that Tim Hortons is largely a breakfast [quick service restaurant]--lunch is a much smaller part of the company\u2019s menu--the sausage extension news is incrementally positive, and at least partially offsets the burger news,\u201d Goldman wrote in a note to clients.\n\nGoldman is one of the two Beyond Meat bulls, as he rates the stock overweight with a $189 price target.", "description": "One of Wall Street\u2019s biggest concerns about Beyond Meat Inc.\u2019s stock is that current valuations limit potential gains, but the odds are now \u2018very high\u2019 that...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI764_beyond_ZG_20190502174920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
