He repeatedly challenged Cuccinelli on the claim and the Trump administration official repeatedly pushed back, saying he didn\u2019t have any additional information or anything further to add on the subject.\n\n\u201cBut you must, because you are in a position of authority now,\u201d said Cuomo. He told Cuccinelli he must either say \u201cthe president meant this, and here\u2019s the basis\u201d or admit \u201cI don\u2019t know why he said that. It is not something that I can prove.\u201d\n\nCuomo later repeatedly asked Cuccinelli if \u201ca single drug dealer\u201d had been caught trying to sneak into the U.S. from the Bahamas because he had heard \u201cthe answer is zero from five different sources.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s great,\u201d responded Cuccinelli, who last month caused controversy when he gave the inscription on the Statue of Liberty a racist twist.\n\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t tell me you were going to ask that question before I got on here,\u201d he complained. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sitting here with no notes. So, I don\u2019t know the answer to that question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that if you had proof that the president was right, you\u2019d be giving it to me right now, Ken,\u201d said Cuomo.\n\n\u201cChris, maybe you should, maybe instead of sandbagging me, you should try to give a little heads-up on what you\u2019d like to actually have a constructive conversation about,\u201d Cuccinelli added.\n\nCheck out the exchange here:\n\nActing US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli couldn't back Trump's warning that Bahamian refugees to the US could be \"gang members\" saying he has no info indicating the agency he leads has caught drug smugglers trying to enter the US after the storm. pic.twitter.com/L1GoDnrwL6 \u2014 Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) September 13, 2019", "description": "\"I think that if you had proof that the president was right, you\u2019d be giving it to me right now, Ken,\" the CNN host told Trump administration official.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7ca9ae2400002e2a7a07f7.jpeg?cache=5exejefz6h&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
