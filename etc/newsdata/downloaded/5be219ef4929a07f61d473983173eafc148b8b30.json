It's a long shot, but one bill wants to make that possibility legal. (AP Photo/Richard Shiro)\n\nWas California the icebreaker for state governments to start pushing for the rights of college athletes?\n\nTwo lawmakers in South Carolina now want athletes in their state to get paid. Sen. Marlon Kimpson and Rep. Justin Bamberg, both Democrats, want to introduce a bill in January that would be similar to what just passed in California.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nFrom The State:\n\nTheir proposal would allow the state\u2019s biggest colleges to pay $5,000-a-year stipends to athletes in profitable sports like football and basketball. It also would give collegiate athletes \u2014 who can receive free tuition and housing, but not pay \u2014 an opportunity to earn money from sponsorships and autograph sales for the first time.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s state senate and assembly passed a bill this week that would allow all college athletes in the state to generate outside revenue like sponsor and endorsement money based on their image and likeness. The bill is now headed to the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom to be potentially signed into law effective Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nUnlike the South Carolina idea, the California bill does not say schools would be required to pay its athletes.\n\nNCAA says California bill is \u2018unconstitutional\u2019\n\nAs you know, NCAA rules prohibit players from getting paid by their schools or anyone else based on their status as a college athlete. And the California bill has the NCAA\u2019s attention. The NCAA has even gone so far as to call it \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d though it, not so curiously, declined to say what part of the United States Constitution would be violated if college athletes could get paid.\n\nKimpson admitted to The State that the California bill was part of the reason why he wanted to push his efforts forward in South Carolina, even though the political climate in the state may make it extremely difficult to get put into law.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThe legislation passed in California is a sign of the times,\u201d Kimpson said. \u201cThe NCAA is not an amateur sports league. This is a multibillion dollar sports empire where everyone involved makes money except the players on the field who earn it.\u201d\n\nRight now it\u2019s unclear how the potential California law would be enforced because the NCAA is not a governmental body. But there\u2019s still three years to figure all of that out. And, quite frankly, it may be a mess that never has to be figured out.\n\nThe California bill\u2019s greatest accomplishment may simply end up being the pressure it\u2019s putting on the NCAA if legislators in other states start doing what Kimpson and Bamberg are doing. The NCAA already has a working group set up to examine how the governing body handles name and image rights for athletes.\n\nIf more and more state governments finally start taking the side of college athletes then the working group may have no choice but to drastically change the way college athletes can make money to avoid messy legal battles all across the country.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Two legislators want to propose a bill that would give $5,000 stipends to players in sports that generate the most revenue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cIRHuy6.jkG4Le_OcDGKVw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wpvdOYeyi.5LN1S4aNMDLA--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8a05c2a0-d628-11e9-afa9-0b63c1a9884b", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
