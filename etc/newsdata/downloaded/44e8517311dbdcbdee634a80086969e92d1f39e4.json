The decision to remove the software came after Apple was criticized by local media for allowing it to exist in Hong Kong in the first place.\n\nThe app, dubbed HKmap.live, was volunteer-run and provided users with the locations of protests and police. Users also had access to real-time information about certain areas, such as whether tear gas was used or not.\n\nApple said in a statement: \" We have learned that an app, HKmap.live, has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe iPhone giant said that many local residents reached out to complain about the app, which reportedly had \"been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement.\"\n\niPhone 11: So Apple actually wants to trademark 'slofie'\n\nInstagram launched 'Threads:' A messaging app to house your intimate conversations\n\nThe app's developers said on Twitter that it disagrees with Apple's decision to pull the application.\n\nBefore shutting it down, Apple was blasted by the local Communist Party\u2019s flagship newspaper called People's Daily. The publication said the app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior.\"\n\n\u201cIs Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?\u201d the newspaper said.
