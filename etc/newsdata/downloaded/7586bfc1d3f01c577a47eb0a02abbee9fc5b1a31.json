Enjoy being reported to virgin.\u201d\n\nThe same seat that wrote \u201cWelcome to hell,\u201d said back, \u201cCurrently you are now in the danger zone.\u201d\n\nShe took photos of the exchange and posted them to Twitter on Saturday, Oct. 5.\n\nYesterday I was on a @VirginAtlantic flight, and I unexpectedly received these sexually harassing messages on my screen (I was in 55C).\n\nThe flight attendants were helpful & dealt with it swiftly.\n\n\n\nHave any other women had this happen to them?#metoo #cyberharassment @SCFGallagher pic.twitter.com/7tbVkRhpQp \u2014 Jessica Van Meir (@jessicavanmeir) October 6, 2019\n\nAfter getting the messages, she quickly reported the incident to flight attendants, who Van Meir said dealt with the issue right away. The crew asked her if they could speak with the men who sent the messages, and she agreed. The messages stopped afterwards.\n\nUnfortunately, Van Meir said she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what happened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on a regular basis that women are catcalled,\u201d Van Meir told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting and it makes you feel unsafe.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI was also appalled and disappointed that someone would be so disrespectful and entitled as to send me messages on a flight when I\u2019m traveling on my own just trying to enjoy my flight peacefully and not be harassed by anyone.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Van Meir said that she took photos of the men after the flight attendants spoke with them, and that one of the men approached her and apologized, saying: \u201cThey were on a rugby trip & he was one of the leaders. He said the guys had been drinking & he\u2019d talk to them, was sorry and hoped we could leave it at that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to everyone who has expressed sympathy & concern.\n\n\n\nAfter the flight attendants spoke with the guys, I walked through the aisle and took a picture of them. Afterwards, a young guy came up to me and said he heard about the chat between me & the guys and wanted to apologize.. \u2014 Jessica Van Meir (@jessicavanmeir) October 7, 2019\n\nShe also added, importantly, that \u201cwhat matters to me is not going after these guys, but making sure they understand why it was harmful.\u201d\n\n...on their behalf, they were on a rugby trip & he was one of the leaders. He said the guys had been drinking & he\u2019d talk to them, was sorry and hoped we could leave it at that.\n\n\n\nWhat matters to me is not going after these guys, but making sure they understand why it was harmful. \u2014 Jessica Van Meir (@jessicavanmeir) October 7, 2019\n\nOne person on Twitter replied to Van Meir, saying, \u201cA bunch of guys were attracted to you, whats the problem?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou cant even flirt with women these days, because I guess now its wrong. A bunch of guys were attracted to you, whats the problem? \u2014 Kingmayne (@ThrowedGuy) October 8, 2019\n\nShe shut him down with her reply: \u201c\u2018Welcome to hell\u2019 isn\u2019t my idea of flirting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWelcome to hell\u201d isn\u2019t my idea of flirting.\n\n\n\nFlirting would be, \u201cHi, I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but I think you\u2019re really cute.
