The industry appeared almost panicked.\n\nAvid itself seemed to go to red-alert. The company told Variety that it was aware of the issue, and Avid CEO Jeff Rosica and its CTO Tim Claman even posted a video on Tuesday reassuring its customers that the company was working \"around the clock\" to fix the issue and that company engineers were scrambled to locations where Macs were affected, according to Variety.\n\nHowever, in the end, it was a Google Chrome web browser update that was the offender, Variety later reported on Wednesday.\n\nGoogle published a post in its Chrome support forum that the latest version of Chrome could affect some macOS systems.\n\nIn its post, a Chrome support manager stated that the issue would only occur if a Mac's \"System Integrity Protection\" was disabled.\n\nThat's not something most Mac users would do, but professional video editors may disable their Mac's System Integrity Protection setting in order to connect external audio and video hardware that aren't typically compatible with Mac computers.\n\nGoogle told Business Insider it had no other comment to add on the incident beyond the company's forum post, linked above.", "description": "Video editors thought it was the common video editing software causing issues, but it was the common web browser that ended up being the troublemaker.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5ac667df4d038653378b4747?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
