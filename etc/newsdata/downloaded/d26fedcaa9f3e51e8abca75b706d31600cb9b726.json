But not all dividend payers have to be sleepy stocks that sell breakfast cereal or toothpaste. If you look around, there are companies that are both generous in their paydays and aggressive with their growth plans for the future. These stocks are a bit riskier, but they also may be interesting options for investors who don't want to simply \"set it and forget it\" in stocks that may offer a few percentage points in dividends but little in the way of revenue growth or share appreciation. Here are nine examples of growth stocks offering dividends that may be worth a look.\n\nNextEra Energy Partners (ticker: NEP)\n\nNextEra Energy Partners is an independent firm that owns and operates clean energy projects in the United States. This makes it the perfect example of a mix between income and growth, since NEP stock has the characteristics of utilities that many low-risk investors like but the upside of renewable energy operations as the global economy transitions away from fossil fuels. In both the current fiscal year and next year's revenue projections for NEP, Wall Street is expecting more than a 30% growth rate. That will help support its dividend, as well as its share price.\n\nCurrent yield: 4%\n\nTerraForm Power (TERP)\n\nAnother alternative energy utility that is on the rise, TERP operates clean power assets in the U.S. and Canada, as well as overseas in European markets like Spain and the U.K. and South American markets such as Chile and Uruguay. This adds an interesting layer of geographic diversification that could be attractive to some investors. TERP is also diversified across green power sources, including both wind and solar. In fiscal 2019, TerraForm is tracking 30% revenue growth with another 10% or so forecast for 2020 on top of that.\n\nCurrent yield: 4.7%\n\nTCF Financial Corp. (TCF)\n\nTCF is a regional bank that offers traditional services including checking accounts, loans to consumers and businesses plus investment services. The $6 billion bank has approximately 500 branches, but the geography it services is quite impressive: TCF stretches from Ohio and Michigan up to South Dakota and Wisconsin and down to Colorado and Arizona. This lean but broad structure seems to be paying off. Revenue will more than double this fiscal year, and then increase more than 30% in 2020 if current forecasts hold.\n\nCurrent yield: 3.2%\n\nMPLX (MPLX)\n\nMPLX is not your typical master limited partnership that just operates a pipeline, charging end-users and passing on a piece of that fee to shareholders as dividends. Rather, this stock is a diversified and growth oriented MLP formed in 2012 with the express goal of developing and acquiring midstream energy infrastructure assets. Thanks to deal-making, along with a close relationship with Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC), revenue is projected to increase about 18% this year and 25% next year.\n\nCurrent yield: 9.9%\n\nNational Storage Affiliates Trust (NSA)\n\nA wholly different kind of storage and logistics company, NSA is focused on independent self-storage facilities. But its approach is similar in some ways -- snap up regional franchises of storage operators and consolidate operations to achieve both revenue growth and economies of scale. The strategy seems to be paying off, because in 2019, NSA's top line will increase 17% and in 2020 the stock will see another 11% in growth. And an added bonus for those worried about a downturn is that storage facilities tend to be in use more during rough times as people downsize or move around to save cash, so this \"counter-cyclical\" income play has defensive appeal as well as growth potential.\n\nCurrent yield: 3.8%\n\nApollo Commercial Real Estate Finance (ARI)\n\nNew York-based ARI is structured as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, but interestingly enough doesn't own large any tracts of land. Instead, it originates, invests in and manages a portfolio of commercial mortgages and other related products. The approach is not that different than middle men on home mortgages who buy the rights to service your loan from another bank. The difference is that office buildings and industrial parks are much more expensive. ARI has been growing nicely lately thanks to an expanding American economy. This year, the REIT will see roughly 19% sales growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Income investors often place a priority on low-risk stocks that dish out a steady stream of dividends, but don't set off a lot fireworks.
