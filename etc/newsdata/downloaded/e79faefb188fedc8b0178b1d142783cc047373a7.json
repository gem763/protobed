Labour\u2019s stance suggests Johnson will fall short of the two-thirds majority he needs in Parliament.\n\nA draft proposal under consideration by EU diplomats would delay Brexit until Jan. 31 with an option for the U.K. to leave earlier -- on Nov. 30 or Dec. 31 -- if both sides ratify the divorce deal in time.\n\nWithout Labour votes, the government\u2019s options are limited under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, which prevents Johnson from moving up the next election scheduled for 2022 without the support of 434 MPs.\n\nBrexit Twists Point to Election. Here\u2019s How It Works: QuickTake\n\nAmid the party maneuvering, the government will consider \u201call options\u201d to trigger an election if Parliament continues to block Brexit, a U.K. official said Sunday.\n\nEarlier, the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party presented a proposal to secure an early election via an amendment to the fixed-term law, which could be passed by simply majority. The two parties, both strongly in favor of staying in the EU, offered to back the bill if the election were set for Dec. 9, three days before Johnson\u2019s preferred date.\n\nAdvantageous\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and the SNP could gain from an election held before Brexit is delivered. An earlier date would make it more likely that students, who are among the most pro-EU voters and a natural constituency for both parties, will still be at their universities to cast ballots.\n\nGovernment ministers rejected the proposal. Conservative Party Chairman James Cleverly called it a \u201cgimmick\u201d that opposition parties could use to thwart Brexit by stopping Parliament from debating the divorce deal.\n\n\u201cThey have obviously made it clear that they have no intention of wanting Brexit to be done, no intention of wanting the Withdrawal Bill,\u201d Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan told Sky News. \u201cIt is important for the sake of the country that we bring this uncertainty to an end.\u201d\n\nRisky Changes\n\nLabour, which has been criticized by some of its MPs for not matching the Liberal Democrats\u2019 full-throated opposition to Brexit, joined the government in ruling out the plan.\n\nCorbyn said the Liberal Democrat move was a \u201cstunt\u201d and that his party\u2019s stance on an early general election has not changed.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we have got to have no-deal completely off the table and the whole threat removed before anything else because of the danger to our economy, to jobs, to trade, to medical supplies,\u201d Corbyn told the BBC.\n\nNo Guarantees\n\nThe EU\u2019s draft extension rules out any further negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, and also isn\u2019t guaranteed to be agreed by all member states. French President Emmanuel Macron blocked the EU\u2019s attempt on Friday to delay Brexit for three months, insisting on a one-month delay to Nov. 30.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government hasn\u2019t laid out a Plan B if it fails to secure an election on Monday, though Johnson\u2019s office has previously said it would focus on its domestic agenda rather than trying again to ratify the Brexit deal. It said the legislation needed to do that is paused, linking its restart to MPs\u2019 support for an early election.\n\nParliament\u2019s fragmentation over Brexit could give rise to an alternative maneuver: the opposition or Johnson himself could trigger a no-confidence vote in the government, which requires a simply majority to succeed.\n\nParty leaders then would have 14 days to form a new government that can win a confidence vote with Johnson\u2019s Conservatives given the first shot as the party with the most seats. But Labour could also try, or some sort of national unity government might be formed.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson stepped up pressure for an early U.K. election, seeking to break the impasse over Brexit while the European Union considers another delay in a divorce he wants to expedite.The two strands converge Monday with a vote in the House of Commons that Johnson looks", "authors": ["Stuart Biggs"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
