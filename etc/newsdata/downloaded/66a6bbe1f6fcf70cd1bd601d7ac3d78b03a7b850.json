All the counter attacks they had were when we lost easy balls.\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\n\"We could have scored more, but I guess job done. I didn't enjoy the game too much but I enjoy the result.\"\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain has only recently recovered from a knee injury that kept him out for a year, and Klopp believes he is yet to reach the levels he is capable of despite the two goals.\n\n\"Ox was like how the game was,\" Klopp added. \"He scored two brilliant goals but knows he can play so much better. I am not too critical. He was out for a long time, with no rhythm.\n\n\"The goals were both incredible. I am really pleased for him, it was a big step.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nNext up for Liverpool is a Premier League clash with Tottenham on Sunday, and Klopp is wary of a rejuvenated Spurs after Mauricio Pochettino's side won for the first time in five games with a 5-0 thrashing of Red Star Belgrade on Tuesday.\n\nKlopp added: \"Tottenham are refreshed. The second before they meet us, they are back on track! They played a good game but we are a different team to Red Star Belgrade and Tottenham is different to Genk.\"", "description": "The German manager believes there is more to come from the returning forward after he scored twice in the Reds' 4-1 win", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Empics Sport", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20710129.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Genk-v-Liverpool-UEFA-Champions-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
