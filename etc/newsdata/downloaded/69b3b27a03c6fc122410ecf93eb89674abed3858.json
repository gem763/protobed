His appointment was later overturned amid a public outcry, though the legal case against him was later dropped.\n\nMember of parliament Johnny Plate defended the changes, saying all state agencies needed oversight.\n\n\"There is no state institution in the world that does not have a supervisory board, without checks and balances,\" Mr Plate told Reuters.\n\nBut activists fear the revisions are designed to weaken the agency, and have led a series of \"save the KPK\" rallies with protesters gathering in front of parliament before Tuesday's vote.\n\nMany of the KPK's investigations have involved members of parliament. A former speaker of the house is among those who have been convicted of graft.\n\nMr Widodo, who has 30 days to sign the law, has defended the changes and stressed that he would not compromise in the fight against graft.\n\nMr Widodo said on Friday that a supervisory board was necessary for \"good governance\", though he said he would pick the members and they would include researchers and anti-corruption activists, not politicians or bureaucrats. MP Teuku Taufiqulhadi said on Tuesday that the external board would be selected by Mr Widodo, instead of parliament as initially planned.\n\nThe government has also faced questions from rights groups over the makeup of the KPK's new board of commissioners.\n\nThe KPK's chief, whose term is ending, will be replaced by police inspector general, Firli Bahuri, who has been accused of ethical violations during a previous attachment at the KPK.\n\nMr Bahuri has said the alleged violations were an internal matter for the KPK.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [JAKARTA] Indonesia's parliament on Tuesday approved changes to a law governing the country's anti-corruption agency, sparking alarm among activists who say revisions that include curbing its freedom to wiretap suspects will hurt the fight against graft. .
