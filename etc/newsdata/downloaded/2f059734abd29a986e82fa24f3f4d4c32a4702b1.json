Republic Airways came in dead last with a score of 0.44.\n\n\u201cIt was such a difficult task of trying to peel the onion for enough information on what\u2019s available, what\u2019s recorded,\u201d says Charles Platkin, the editor of DietDetective.com and the executive director of the Hunter College New York City Food Policy Center.\n\n[Celebrities have a thing for sanitizing airplane seats. Should we follow their lead?]\n\nPlatkin used data from the Environmental Protection Agency and based his study on 10 criteria, such as airlines\u2019 positive E. coli and coliform water sample reports, fleet size and violation of the federal government\u2019s Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR).\n\nSo where does this research and information leave travelers? The major takeaways from the study were: avoid drinking coffee or tea on flights; never drink water on board that doesn\u2019t come from a sealed bottle; and instead of washing your hands in the lavatory, use hand sanitizer.\n\n\n\n(Washington Post illustration; iStock)\n\nSolving airplane water problems has been a long process. Back in 2004, the EPA found all aircraft public water systems (PWSs) to be out of compliance with the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs).\n\n\u201cThe existing NPDWRs were designed for traditional, stationary public water systems, not mobile aircraft water systems that are operationally very different,\u201d an EPA Spokesperson told the Washington Post in an emailed statement. \u201cTo address this concern, in 2009, EPA finalized the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR). This rule works to ensure that safe and reliable drinking water is provided to aircraft passengers and crew by amending and consolidating National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for aircraft PWSs.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the federal government implemented the ADWR which also required that water in the lavatory, galley faucets and drinking fountains must be safe for human consumption \u2014 meaning drinking, bathing, teeth brushing and hand washing. According to the EPA\u2019s website, plane water regulations \u201cinclude maximum allowable levels of contaminants, treatment requirements, and monitoring and reporting requirements.\u201d\n\nMost of the airlines studied have reported water samples that tested positive for E. coli and coliform bacteria between 2012 and 2019, which can be harmful if you\u2019re a passenger drinking that water on a flight.\n\nAn aircraft\u2019s water can become contaminated in a number of ways. There\u2019s potential for contamination when water is boarded onto a flight using temporary connections (like carts, hoses, trucks, etc.), if the water system is inadequately maintained or if biofilm grows within the water system.\n\n[Here\u2019s what an airline could owe you for ruining a trip]\n\nThe 2019 Airline Water Study also found that even when the EPA does find airlines in violation of the ADWR, the agency rarely levies civil penalties for the infractions.\n\n\u201cThe EPA needs to focus on penalties being more transparent,\u201d Platkin says. \u201cWe see the violations; where is the list of penalties?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe completely correct guide to reclining on an airplane\n\nFollow By The Way on Instagram for city highlights, travel tips and more\n\nHow did clapping on planes become such a divisive issue?", "description": "Next time you're on a plane, you may want to pass on the coffee or tea.", "authors": ["Natalie B.
