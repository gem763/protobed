He is a class player and is pivotal to us.\n\n\u201cWe may or may not be in Europe after January, so that\u2019s even more reason for him not to go.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hinge on that, absolutely not. But it would be a nice carrot for him, a reason to settle himself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like watching him playing for other teams. When I heard about his hat-trick, I was like: Oh no!\n\n\u201cBut, seriously, it is great for the profile of the club.\n\n\"I think it is fantastic for him that he is playing so well for club and country.\n\n\u201cHe will be linked with everybody in the next couple of weeks and come the end of January, but we are in no position to sell.\n\n\u201cSpeaking to his representatives, they\u2019re really happy with the way things are going, as well. So long may that continue and he\u2019s a real cool customer.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll leave it to other people to worry about who is interested, if that comes up.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been outstanding this season in all the games. He\u2019s playing, he looks happy, his all-round game is coming on and his goals now are starting to be something else.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s turned himself into a really prolific goal scorer and looks in a really good place at the minute.\n\nWe forget how young he is. He\u2019s still only 21, so we don\u2019t want to put any extra pressure on him.\n\n\u201cBut he takes on a lot of responsibly by being, more or less, the No. 9 here at the minute and he\u2019s revelling in it.\u201d", "description": "Odsonne Edouard has netted five goals in seven appearances for Celtic this season which should make the likes of Man Utd and Arsenal take notice", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654080.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Celtic-FC-v-CFR-Cluj-Group-E-UEFA-Europa-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
