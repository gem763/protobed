It is really quite a tragic case,' he said.\n\nAfter her death, eight men from Adelaide were considered as 'persons of interest'.\n\nDianne Brimble was found naked in a cabin after taking multiple doses of GHB (pictured: cabin where Brimble's body was found)\n\nDuring a coronial inquest in 2006, prosecutors claimed the mother had died after being drugged with GHB and fantasy.\n\nOne of the men Mark Wilhelm, admitted to having sex with the 42-year-old shortly before her death.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to supplying her with the drug fantasy in April 2010.\n\nAfter a long running trial the jury were unable to reach a verdict and the charges laid against three of the men were downgraded.\n\nOne of the men Mark Wilhelm (pictured), admitted to having sex with the 42-year-old shortly before her death.\n\nEvidence was given that Mrs Brimble took the drug intentionally and sex with Willhelm was consensual.\n\nThe jury was hung after jurors were unable to determine whether the drug had significantly caused her death.\n\nGHB is a depressant drug which slows down messages that travel from the brain to the body.\n\nIt is commonly referred to as fantasy or liquid ecstasy and gives the user a sense of euphoria.", "description": "Dianne Brimble, 42, from Brisbane, was found dead in a cabin while travelling on the Pacific Sky ship with her daughter in September 2002.", "authors": ["Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/02/19816518-0-image-a-2_1571275503739.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
