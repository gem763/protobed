Understand there were 3,000 locals ready to help,\u201d the post said.\n\nBut Power said police had been on the lookout for members of the public taking spilled beer cans and there had been none.\n\n\u201cMaybe all the people weren\u2019t fans of VB,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it had been Reschs there would have been a riot,\u201d he said, apparently referring to his favourite beer.", "description": "A truck filled with beer rolled on Australia's busiest highway, spilling thousands of cans of the amber liquid and closing part of the road for hours, police said.", "authors": ["Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
