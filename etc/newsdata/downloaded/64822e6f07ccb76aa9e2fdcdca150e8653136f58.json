A smattering of academics and Catholic bishops rounded out participants at \u201cThe Common Good in the Digital Age\u201d conference.\n\nThe three-day gathering is the latest evidence of the Vatican wanting a place in the debate over the prospects and perils of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe debates included technology advancements in warfare and the future of work with increasing reliance on machines, as well as a case study examining the Christchurch, New Zealand, massacre and decisions taken by social media companies after video spread of the carnage.\n\nIn his speech to the conference, Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that machines at the dawn of the industrial revolution spared workers dangerous and monotonous labor. But he warned that increased reliance on robotics for the sake of profits risked depriving people of the dignity of labor.\n\n\u201cIf technological advancement became the cause of increasingly evident inequalities, it would not be true and real progress,\u201d he warned. \u201cIf mankind\u2019s so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest.\u201d\n\nOrganizers of the conference said they hoped to tap into participants\u2019 expertise identify possible future advisers for the Catholic Church on high tech issues.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pope Francis on Friday warned tech company executives, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development pose the risk of increasing social inequality unless the work is accompanied by an ethical evaluation of the common good.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
