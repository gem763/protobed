In second place, it\u2019s the human beings who\u2019ve either given in to their most savage instincts or are just plain sick in the head. Tetanus might be third, because where are you getting your booster shots these days? And then there are the dangers of one\u2019s own mind, as your sanity slips away due to the horrors of everyday life, exhaustion due to the horrors of everyday life, and the pills you\u2019re taking to cope with the horrors of everyday life. (Dark horse candidate for fifth on the kill-your-ass-dead list: rabies. Think about all the zombie meat that your average feral animal is eating. I\u2019d be just as afraid of raccoons as walkers. Maybe more.)\n\nIt\u2019s the terrors of the mind that mostly dominate this episode, as Carol struggles to cope with the death of Henry while his executioners not only stumble about as they please, but also completely run her world. Yet we begin with threats of the old-fashioned kind, as a timeline of violent events is laid out in dramatic detail. For those who missed the nuances of the opening sequence, here\u2019s a recap-within-the-recap:\n\n6:00 A.M. HOUR 1: Big windmill, Carol\u2019s alarm goes off, she downs the first of many, many uppers.\n\nHOUR 2: Walkers are on the move.\n\nHOUR 4: Some dude with a spear and the tatted blonde ex-Savior kill zombies and goof around.\n\nHOUR 6: This walker business is getting serious.\n\nHOUR 11: A-A-ron gets jumped by a crispy zombie; scores of dead undead on the ground.\n\nHOUR 13: Wave after wave of undead swarm A-Town. Is this what Beta was doing last week, rounding up walkers and sending them toward the survivors?\n\nHOUR 14: Still more zombies. Michonne and Daryl look concerned.\n\nHOUR 19: Killing zombies at the fence in the dark.\n\nHOUR 22: See above.\n\nHOUR 24: Daybreak; slaughter continues.\n\nHOUR 31: Full sunlight, zombies impaled on fence. Daryl busts out the crossbow.\n\nHOUR 37: Nighttime again, Aaron scores some spear kills.\n\nHOUR 44: Still dark; Daryl still slaying. Funny that Gabe looks exhausted because we haven\u2019t seen him kill a damn thing. Michonne stops by to see the kids, but Judith barely has time to ask \u201cIs it safe?\u201d before she gets an emergency call on the walkie.\n\nHOUR 49: Two walker posses coming from different directions. Michonne lowers binoculars and seems to think \u201cWTF,\u201d as do we.\n\nThe point here, people, is that a lot of zombies are relentlessly laying siege to A-Town, which seems like a no-brainer Alpha move \u2014 except Gamma strolls in to tell them it isn\u2019t, and invites them to what sounds like a not-very-optional meeting with the boss. It makes sense that Alpha is not orchestrating the zombie assault; Daryl estimates the Whisperer \u201choard\u201d he witnessed numbers in the tens of thousands, so if she wanted to wipe out A-Town, she would have done it by now. After a town-hall meeting in which Michonne tells a bloodthirsty Highwaymenwoman to basically shut the F up, they decide to \u2014 surprise! \u2014 split up. Two groups will fight off the walker waves, while a smaller envoy meets with Alpha.\n\nPredictably, the summit does not go well. Carol, who\u2019s poppin\u2019 pills and packin\u2019 heat, is on edge as she returns to the site of her son\u2019s headsicle. Alpha makes a grand entrance and lays out her case: Carol\u2019s peeps have crossed into her territory three times \u2014 during the satellite fire, through last season\u2019s snowstorm, and when Michonne and Aaron searched along the river. Punishment is due, she says, \u201cbut I considah con-text. There will be no bloodshed this time.\u201d Instead, Alpha sets a new border, one that strips the survivors of their hunting grounds. When Carol gets mouthy, Alpha steps to her and goes full Alpha: \u201cBlond boy \u2026 he screamed your name just before we took his head.\u201d\n\nCarol pulls her snub-nose pistol and would have shot Alpha point blank if not for Michonne\u2019s lightning-fast reflexes. But Alpha curiously gives Carol a pass \u2014 \u201cmother to mother\u201d \u2014 before telling them to go on and git movin\u2019 \u2019cause this is her land now. Later, when Michonne tries to calm her friend down, Carol doesn\u2019t mince words: \u201cThe bitch has to die.\u201d Well said. (BTW, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the sea captain\u2019s life or the drugs, but Carol is not only talking fierce, she\u2019s looking fierce. You work those sleep deprivation lewks, gurl!)\n\nAs usual, Carol\u2019s group seeks shelter somewhere creepy and finds the home of the Fighting Foxhounds, a school that provides the perfect setting for Carol\u2019s horrific hallucinations. The highlight of the episode is her vision of the home-economics textbook with her on the cover, serving flapjacks to all of her dead kids. Daryl tries to talk some sense into her by telling her a story about his old man seeing things \u2014 or does he? Turns out that was a fantasy, too, as was the well-timed jump-scare when someone appears behind her with a knife. Even worse, Carol literally walks into a Whisperer trap and suffers a nasty wound in the process. Hard to blame her for not wanting to sleep, but can her nightmares be any worse than her state of semi-reality?\n\nA few subplots offer some distraction from Carol\u2019s crumbling psyche, though Siddiq isn\u2019t doing much better with his own demons. The new doctor dude lightens the mood by telling a tale about an Iraq War veteran he knows, some \u201cAdonis-looking cat\u201d who struggled with PTSD \u2014 the twist being that he is in fact said cat, which gives the otherwise traumatized Siddiq a good laugh. Meanwhile, out in the wilderness, Negan and Aaron have a power struggle and wrestle with each other and the notion of who\u2019s keeping it realer \u2014 the newly badass Aaron with his spiked mace hand, or the newly docile Negan who\u2019d rather farm than fight. The testy debate ends with Negan saving his work-release manager and even helping him recover from hogweed blindness. (Who knew?) Then there\u2019s Eugene, who somehow still thinks he\u2019s got a shot at being \u201cre-zoned into Lovetown\u201d with Rosita. Dear Eugene: Please stick to the overwritten one-liners and the inexplicable ability to provide essential intel \u2014 from zombie head counts to weather patterns \u2014 whenever needed.\n\nTwo things appear to be true in the end: The zombies were drawn in by the satellite crash, and Carol isn\u2019t completely bonkers. She swears she saw Whisperers in the woods and at the school, and sure enough, when we see the undead bodies strewn across the gym floor, one of them is the Whisperer who inspected Carol as she hung upside down. Carol squeezed off one last shot before she cut herself loose, and the Whisperer appears to have a bullet wound. Looks like Alpha wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she\u2019s always watching them. To answer your question, Judith \u2014 no, it definitely isn\u2019t safe. Stay awoke, kid.", "description": "Even as zombies lay siege to A-Town, it\u2019s the terrors of the mind that dominate this episode.
