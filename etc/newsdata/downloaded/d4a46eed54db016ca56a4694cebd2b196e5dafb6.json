He was on that text exchange with acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker that I wrote about yesterday and Ed wrote about this morning. At one point in an exchange from September, Taylor said, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign\u201d \u2014 evidence that even Trump\u2019s own diplomats feared the possibility of a secret quid pro quo.\n\nIt was Sondland who replied to him, \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d And who then asked that the conversation be continued offline.\n\nNow here\u2019s GOP Sen. Ron Johnson telling the WSJ that *Sondland* was the one who told him in August that a quid pro quo appeared to be in the works. But when Johnson raised that possibility with Trump himself, Trump denied it firmly.\n\nMr. Johnson, who supports aid to Ukraine and is the chairman of a Senate subcommittee with jurisdiction over the region, said Mr. Trump was adamant on the issue. \u201cHe said\u2014expletive deleted\u2014\u2018No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?\u201d the Wisconsin senator recalled [of their August 31 phone call]. Mr. Johnson told Mr. Trump that he had learned of the arrangement from Mr. Sondland\u2026 Mr. Johnson said he learned of the potential arrangement involving military aid through a phone call with Mr. Sondland that occurred the day before Mr. Johnson spoke to Mr. Trump. Under the arrangement, Mr. Johnson said Mr. Sondland told him, Ukraine would appoint a strong prosecutor general and move to \u201cget to the bottom of what happened in 2016\u2014if President Trump has that confidence, then he\u2019ll release the military spending,\u201d recounted Mr. Johnson. \u201cAt that suggestion, I winced,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cMy reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t believe Mr. Biden\u2019s name came up during his conversations with Mr. Sondland or Mr. Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s denial is obviously a good fact for him. At no point during this Ukraine saga has anyone accused him of directly condoning a quid pro quo in discussions with aides or anyone else. It\u2019s all read-between-the-line stuff, like his request for a \u201cfavor\u201d from Zelensky during their phone call after Zelensky mentioned purchasing U.S. missiles. On the other hand, the fact that Sondland saw some sort of quid pro quo in the works with Ukraine while the military aid was on hold is \u2026 not a great fact. This makes two separate diplomats, including Taylor, who appear to have believed that an aid-for-investigation trade was happening.\n\nAnd it creates a mystery around Sondland. Why was he under the impression on August 30 when chatting with Johnson that there was a quid pro quo and then, 10 days later, eager to remind Taylor via text that Trump has been clear about there being no quid pro quo? If he had his facts wrong when he spoke to Johnson, how did he come to be so badly misinformed? Note that Johnson says he named Sondland when Trump asked on August 31 who had told him about a quid pro quo. Maybe the president gave his diplomat a talking-to afterward, although whether that was to correct him on the facts or to involve him in a cover-up is unclear right now.\n\nIn fact, we know from the Times that Sondland was consulting with Trump even during the now-famous text exchange with Bill Taylor on September 9. After Taylor texted that it was crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign, five hours passed without a reply from Sondland. At some point in that period, he spoke to Trump. Then he texted Taylor back with his for-the-record \u201cThe President has been crystal clear\u201d response. What did he and Trump talk about that morning?\n\nGordon Sondland is going to be a very important witness.\n\nMaybe this is why Sondland believed in August that there was a quid pro quo:\n\nTwo of President Trump\u2019s top envoys to Ukraine worked on a statement for the country\u2019s new president in August that would have committed Ukraine to pursuing investigations sought by Mr. Trump into his political rivals, according to three people briefed on the effort and documents released Thursday night\u2026 The statement was worked on by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, according to the documents and the three people who have been briefed on the statement. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and the de facto leader of a shadow campaign to push the Ukrainians to press ahead with investigations, provided the critical element of the language, Mr. Volker told House Democratic investigators on Thursday, a person familiar with his testimony said\u2026 Late Thursday, House Democrats released a series of texts between Mr. Volker, Mr. Sondland and Andriy Yermak, a top aide to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that also showed that officials in both countries understood that Mr. Trump would not grant Mr. Zelensky an Oval Office meeting he was seeking until Ukraine agreed to make a public commitment to the investigations being sought by the American side.\n\nA key line from later in the article: \u201cThe idea behind the statement was to break the Ukrainians of their habit of promising American diplomats and leaders behind closed doors that they would look into matters and never follow through, the people briefed on it said.\u201d That makes sense in light of the strange fact that Trump and Zelensky seemed to agree during their July 25 call that it was important to investigate corruption and yet *Trump held up Ukraine\u2019s military aid anyway*, with the Ukrainians reportedly not realizing until a month later that the aid wasn\u2019t coming. People have pointed to that as evidence that there wasn\u2019t a quid pro quo after all, that if the aid really had been tied to Ukraine\u2019s cooperation then it would have been released immediately after Zelensky\u2019s call with Trump. In reality, though, it may simply be that Trump was skeptical \u2014 understandably \u2014 that the Ukrainians would follow through on their pledge to probe Biden once they had the aid in hand. The aid may have been Trump\u2019s leverage to make sure Zelensky actually kept his promise. \u201cSure, you\u2019ll get your aid. But first let\u2019s see some movement on that Biden investigation.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, the Ukrainian government announced today that they are in fact reopening the probe into the owner of Burisma, along with several others. From their standpoint, that\u2019s the smart play. There\u2019s a decent chance that Trump is reelected next fall; staying on the president\u2019s good side may be the difference between being overrun by Russia before 2024 and holding them off. They\u2019re going to play ball with him as much as they think they can without alienating the Democrats too much.\n\nOne more point on the quid pro quo. This text is awfully hard to justify and explains why Volker, Taylor, and Sondland may have believed early on in this process that Trump was interested in a quid pro quo.\n\nCome on Republicans. It\u2019s time to do your trick and defend this. Sit up! Speak! pic.twitter.com/98PvtBu0aO \u2014 TextingAboutCrimeHat (@Popehat) October 4, 2019\n\nThere\u2019s no mention of military aid there but Volker claims he\u2019s been told by someone in the White House itself that Trump is approaching relations with Zelensky transactionally, with 2016 investigations a crucial part of the transaction. If Zelensky wants an audience at the White House, he knows what he has to do. Go figure that the hold-up in military aid later would be viewed by Taylor and many others through the same prism.\n\nExit question: How good of a relationship does Trump have with Senate Republicans, especially Ron Johnson? Would he feel comfortable enough to shoot straight with Johnson, in which case his denial of a quid pro quo during their phone call carries more weight? Or would he have worried about Johnson exposing the quid pro quo if Trump admitted to it, in which case the denial matters less? Bear in mind that Senate Republicans are almost uniformly pro-Ukraine and anti-Russia and Trump knows it. He would have had reason to believe that if he told Johnson he was blocking Ukraine money to get leverage over Biden, Johnson would have reacted badly for foreign-policy reasons, if not ethical ones.", "description": "\"Sondland\" is Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the EU.
