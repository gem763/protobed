Nadler needs an investigation that will grab voters\u2019 attention \u2014 and nothing sells like sex, baby. Even if it\u2019s just the stale aftertaste of a scandal that didn\u2019t produce any bombshells except for perjury the first time around, it seems:\n\nHouse Democrats plan to make President Trump\u2019s alleged involvement in a 2016 scheme to silence two women who claimed they had affairs with him a major investigative focus this fall, picking up where federal prosecutors left off in a case legal experts say could have led to additional indictments. The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold hearings and call witnesses involved in hush-money payments to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels as soon as October, according to people familiar with the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Democrats say they believe there is already enough evidence to name Trump as a co-conspirator in the episode that resulted in his former attorney, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to two campaign finance charges.\n\nThis again? Even Robert Mueller didn\u2019t take this one seriously. Neither did the Southern District of New York, where Mueller kicked the case after realizing that Michael Cohen was not nearly as valuable a witness as he claimed. It\u2019s not illegal to reach settlements to keep affairs quiet, even if it is unseemly \u2014 and even if it did blow up in Trump\u2019s face. Federal prosecutors who had every motive to make a case against Trump didn\u2019t find one to make, as the Post notes, even though Trump did get a supporting role in Cohen\u2019s indictment as \u201cIndividual-1.\u201d\n\nAt best, this is a campaign-finance case and a weak one at that, Paul Mirengoff argues at Power Line. It\u2019s an FEC issue, not an impeachment issue:\n\nThe payments predate Trump\u2019s presidency. Is it a \u201chigh crime and misdemeanor\u201d for a candidate to buy the silence of someone who has damaging information about him? I don\u2019t think so. At worst, it\u2019s a technical violation of campaign finance law, and I doubt it even amounts to that. But why let this stand in the way of sexy hearings? Stormy Daniels and the ex-Playboy model might be able to attract media attention and draw viewers to hearings that otherwise hardly anyone would watch. Might their testimony harm Trump\u2019s image? I doubt there\u2019s anyone left in America who thinks Trump is above having sex with attractive women. I also doubt that any potential Trump voter would fail to understand his effort to keep such matters out of the public\u2019s eye during a presidential election campaign. But maybe Trump will take a minor hit if Daniels testifies that her sexual encounter with Trump occurred not long after his wife had given birth. As for the alleged campaign finance violation, we\u2019re back to yawn inducing.\n\nMirengoff misses the biggest problem for Nadler and Democrats in pushing this probe. It will necessarily make Cohen their star witness. Need we remind readers that Cohen\u2019s presently living at Club Fed for committing perjury? In his previous testimony before Congress, no less? Democrats got ripped earlier this year for bringing Cohen back for more testimony after his conviction for providing false information to Congress, at which time he apparently perjured himself all over again.\n\nNadler could avoid calling Cohen, but without Cohen Nadler won\u2019t have a case. The feds couldn\u2019t make a case even when they had Cohen. Without Cohen, all Nadler can show is that Trump had sleazy affairs before running for president, which is hardly commendable but also irrelevant for impeachment.\n\nThis looks like desperation on Nadler\u2019s part, and Politico explains why:\n\nIn the meantime, Washington is stuck in an impeachment muddle \u2014 with Democrats straddling an ambiguous line between impeachment proceedings and standard congressional investigations. It\u2019s a dynamic that will test the unity of a diverse Democratic caucus this fall, and shape the party\u2019s battle to hold on to the House and defeat Trump in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t think the public is really \u2026 clear about what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) on the state of play. \u201cWhether that\u2019s an intentional strategy or not, I don\u2019t know. But I think that\u2019s clearly the case.\u201d \u2026 Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming court battles, Democrats will have to decide soon whether they want to force the matter. Many pro-impeachment Democrats say they need to make substantial strides by the end of the year, before the 2020 presidential campaign begins in earnest. The unsettled state of the impeachment question was reflected in the statements of lawmakers who declared support for impeachment proceedings throughout the August recess. Some called for an impeachment inquiry outright. Others simply declared support for the Judiciary Committee\u2019s \u201congoing\u201d impeachment efforts. Beyer said he can\u2019t pinpoint a precise moment when Democrats suddenly found themselves engaged in impeachment proceedings. Instead, he described it as a natural shift in the course of Democrats\u2019 investigations.\n\nIf Nadler\u2019s coming back around to Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen, then he doesn\u2019t have a case at all. If Nadler did have a case, he wouldn\u2019t have to reach back into that morass to sell it. Nadler\u2019s running out of time, and he knows it.", "description": "Desperation.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/daniels.jpg"}
