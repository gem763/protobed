So much so, the Gunners reportedly tried to sign the winger in the summer.\n\nArsenal bought Zaha\u2019s Ivory Coast teammate Pepe instead, which will only give the former Manchester United winger a point to prove at the Emirates.\n\nZaha won the penalty for the equaliser at Selhurst Park and scored in the away win and to score anytime on Sunday with William Hill is 3/1.\n\nPepe finally kicking into gear\n\nAn image that would have been replaying in most Arsenal fans\u2019 minds after the embarrassing defeat to Sheffield United would be Nicolas Pepe\u2019s awful miss.\n\nArsenal\u2019s club-record signing only had the keeper to beat when he missed a perfect Sead Kolasinac cross.\n\nHowever, the Ivorian\u2019s match-winning brace against Vitoria will have gone some way to restoring supporters\u2019 faith in the highly-rated winger.\n\nHis two free-kicks were brilliant and William Hill have Pepe to score anytime and Arsenal to win at 7/4.", "description": "Betting odds as Arsenal look fragile despite their mid-week win against Vitoria and Crystal Palace can take advantage of their poor Premier League form.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/betting/Better-Collective/arsenal-players-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
