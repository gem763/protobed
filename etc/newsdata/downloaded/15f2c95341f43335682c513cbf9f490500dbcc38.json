It is expected to appeal to people of Sikh heritage living in London, and perhaps as far away as the East Midlands \u2013 though Air India already flies from Birmingham to Amritsar.\n\nThe chief executive of the Essex airport, Ken O\u2019Toole, said: \u201cStansted is ideally situated to serve the Asian community in North and East London and across the East of England so we are delighted that Air India has recognised the customer demand for Amritsar.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to use our spare runway capacity to build our long-haul route network and improve the UK\u2019s connectivity with the rest of the world at a time when availability is in short supply across south-east airports.\n\n\u201cThe welcome arrival of Air India is another positive step towards that goal.\u201d\n\nDavid Rooke, location services director at Invest Essex, said: \u201cThis new Air India route will facilitate major business opportunities in both countries and can only strengthen business trade and investment building upon the substantial and growing Indian owned business base in Essex.\u201c\n\nThe Indian carrier has until now focused its London services solely on Heathrow.\n\nBut with slots at a premium at Europe\u2019s busiest airport, Air India is looking for new opportunities.\n\nStansted is the main base for Ryanair, and has a busy network of European flights on easyJet and Jet2. But it has had a rocky relationship with long-haul scheduled flying. Over the years a number of transatlantic routes, primarily to the US, have failed.\n\nIn the 2000s Air Asia X launched a link from the Essex airport to Kuala Lumpur, but after a couple of years it moved to Gatwick \u2013 and was cancelled soon after.", "description": "Long-haul scheduled flights are back at Stansted airport.
