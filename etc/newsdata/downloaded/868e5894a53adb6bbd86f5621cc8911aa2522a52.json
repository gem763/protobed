It must be a meeting without politicians and spin doctors, a personal meeting with psychological counsellors so the Dunn family can find out what happened in the final moments of their son\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nHe added that Sacoolas\u2019s son had been in the front seat of her car at the time of the incident, saying \u201cthat would have been a traumatic experience for her son, and I\u2019m sure the Sacoolas family are dealing with matters that are tragic as well\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Dunn, who died when his motorbike collided with a car outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, on 27 August. Photograph: Family handout/PA\n\nThe breakthrough came at the weekend when Sacoolas broke her six-week silence through lawyers to say she was \u201cdevastated by the tragic accident\u201d.\n\nHer legal representative, Amy Jeffress, said: \u201cNo loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunn\u2019s family.\u201d Jeffress added in her statement that Sacoolas had \u201cfully cooperated with the police\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe spoke with authorities at the scene of the accident and met with the Northampton police at her home the following day. She will continue to cooperate with the investigation,\u201d the statement continued.\n\n\u201cAnne would like to meet with Mr Dunn\u2019s parents so that she can express her deepest sympathies and apologies for this tragic accident.\n\n\u201cWe have been in contact with the family\u2019s attorneys and look forward to hearing from them.\u201d\n\nThe statement does not include an explicit commitment to return to the UK to meet with UK prosecutors.\n\nIn an unexpected letter to the family on Saturday, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said diplomatic immunity no longer applied now that Sacoolas was back in her own country, a formula that allows the British and Americans to reaffirm that immunity did apply when she was in the UK, an issue about which there has been dispute.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cWe have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done... Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.\n\n\u201cThe question remains when such an immunity comes to an end, regardless of any waiver. We have looked at this very carefully... the UK government\u2019s position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas\u2019s case, because she has returned home.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn these circumstances, Harry\u2019s case is now a matter for the Northants police and the Crown Prosecution Service to take forward.\u201d\n\nRaab, who trained as a lawyer and spent some time working in human rights before joining the Foreign Office in 2000, did not suggest that immunity had ended on Sacoolas\u2019s return to the US when he met Dunn\u2019s parents last Wednesday, and in his letter explained he had not wanted to convey that view to them until he was legally confident.\n\nAccording to one account, Raab visibly winced when he was told by the parents that they were being advised by Stephens and Geoffrey Robinson QC, the two leading British specialists in diplomatic immunity.\n\nStephens said that regardless of the status of her claim to immunity in the UK, it was always clear from previous case law that diplomatic immunity did not apply once a diplomat returned to their own country, and that, for instance, a Russian diplomat involved in a serious offence in the UK could be tried for that offence by the Russian government.\n\nQ&A How does diplomatic immunity work? Show Hide Diplomatic immunity is the protection given under international and UK law to foreign diplomats and their families. It was formalised through the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations (VCDR). Reciprocal global agreements also protect UK diplomats working abroad. Without a foreign state agreeing to lift immunity, diplomats and their dependent families can only be detained \u201cas a last resort\u201d if, for example, they are deemed to be a danger to others or themselves. The only other sanction available to the Foreign Office would be to order their expulsion. When a foreign state agrees to remove that legal protection, it is known as a \u201cwaiver of immunity\u201d. Individual diplomats cannot do so; the embassy of the foreign state has to make a formal request. As well as covering diplomats and their families anywhere in the UK, the same convention and legislation prevents UK officials from entering diplomatic premises. That inviolability enabled Julian Assange to stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years. Owen Bowcott, Legal affairs correspondent\n\nStephens said: \u201cAnne Sacoolas was allowed to, or encouraged to be spirited away on an American transport plane and effectively rendered a fugitive from British justice.\u201d\n\nJonathan Sacoolas, Anne\u2019s husband, who was employed at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire, is understood to work for the CIA, and the UK still says he and his dependants enjoyed immunity as staff at the base.\n\nIt is not clear how much choice Anne Sacoolas was given in the decision to fly herself and her family back to the US in a military plane, or how much either the Foreign Office or the Northamptonshire police resisted such a move in the hours immediately following the incident.\n\nStephens said: \u201cThey clearly decided they did not want any publicity, but had not expected the parents of Dunn to start campaigning as much as they have. Their handling of this has turned a tragedy into a disaster for them.\u201d\n\nIn response to the letter, Dunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, said the apology offered so far was not sufficient.\n\nShe told Sky News: \u201cMy opinion on Anne Sacoolas now wanting to come forward and say sorry \u2013 to be perfectly honest, yes, it\u2019s the start of some closure for our family.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, as it\u2019s nearly seven weeks now since we lost our boy, sorry just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe\u2019ve known from the start that the \u2018extra\u2019 feeling in the pit of our tummies, told us that something wasn\u2019t right. We\u2019re proud of ourselves for fighting for justice for Harry, and not ignoring this gnawing within our bodies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d rather have our beautiful boy back, but we are also elated that all this fighting for justice for Harry has not been in vain.\u201d", "description": "Lawyers acting for family say meeting must be \u2018without politicians and spin doctors\u2019", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour", "Barbara Ellen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e3d0bd848605c2571a06f4e62e383bc8733ea93/0_10_6539_3924/master/6539.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1365fa73f32dd162a351383db7dd867c", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
