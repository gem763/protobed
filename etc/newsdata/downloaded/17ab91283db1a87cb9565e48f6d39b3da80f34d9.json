Bush at a Dallas Cowboys game.\n\nIt was, and is, stunning to me that she felt she had to defend herself for sitting next to someone who she considers a friend, but who happens to have different political opinions. I mean, let\u2019s all pause and let that sink in for a moment.\n\nTwo people watching a football game. Two people enjoying themselves and their friendship. Two people being kind to each other. That makes people mad?\n\nAre we supposed to only talk to, sit with and be friends with people who share our exact same opinions about God, country and politics?\n\nI worry that most who reacted negatively to Ellen\u2019s picture were only reacting because of their own personal opinions. They couldn\u2019t give her the respect to make her own choice about her beliefs, her friendships or whom she chooses to spend time with.\n\nThese days, people just seem to despise anyone who is not in their political wheelhouse. Can we not be friends with someone from a different political party anymore? Can we not be friends with someone from a different religious background? Can we not be friends with someone who comes from a different walk of life, or who is a different color or who has different experiences than our own? Is that where we are now as a nation and as people? I fear that for many, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nI understand that many are reacting strongly right now because tensions are so high in our nation. A lot of people are hurting, scared, struggling and worried about where we\u2019re headed next. Many fear the \u201cother\u201d because they view those different than them as a threat to their own lives, futures, and beliefs.\n\nBut if you ask me, our political problems will only deepen if we all retreat into our own corners.\n\nIt\u2019s this kind of thinking that is driving us apart. It\u2019s this that is keeping us apart and preventing our families, our friendships, our politics and our country from coming together and bridging the divide. It\u2019s this kind of thinking \u2014 this kind of judgment \u2014 that was hurled at Ellen. This should cause us all to stop and dig deep within ourselves.\n\nIs this really who we want to be? Is this really what we want to teach our children? Is this how we truly feel? I don\u2019t believe it is. I won\u2019t accept it, and I don\u2019t think you should either.\n\nThink about how you feel when hate and judgment are directed your way. Does it make you feel good? Does it make you want to show kindness and love to yourself and others? Of course not.\n\nThe reaction to Ellen sitting with former President Bush presents us all with a teachable moment. Do we, or do we not, want to be leaders of a movement that fosters kindness, acceptance, compassion, understanding and love? It takes an open heart and an open mind.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to spew hate, but it\u2019s also small-minded. It\u2019s easy to post a mean tweet, but it is also cowardly and weak. It\u2019s so easy to judge, but it\u2019s way harder to love someone who is different than you or who you think is different than you.\n\nI believe it\u2019s our job right now to try and figure out what we have in common. Maybe we both have felt like the \u201cother\u201d at some point in our lives. Maybe we both feel shame about something that we\u2019ve done wrong and desperately want to right. Maybe we both are worried about the state of our nation\u2019s heart and want to find common ground so we can work together to do better. Maybe, just maybe, Ellen and former President Bush were talking about that.\n\nThe fact is, we will never know what we have in common \u2014 we will never heal our divide \u2014 unless we can agree to sit down next to someone unexpected and begin a friendship. Try it and see how it makes you feel. It just might heal your heart, your world, and our world at large.\n\nThis essay has been condensed for length.", "description": "Maria Shriver pens essay in her Sunday Paper about being friends with people of different views and experiences.", "authors": ["Maria Shriver"], "top_image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_42/1493955/maria-shriver-essay-today-main-191015_1f860ab3491148d4dca7be2bd5d8f465.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
