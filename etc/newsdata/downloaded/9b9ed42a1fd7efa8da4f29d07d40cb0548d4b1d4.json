Her fans like that she has plans, but it\u2019s not the details they seem to be attracted to. Nor is their support based on a belief that Warren can deliver the scale of transformation she\u2019s promising; indeed, nearly all of the attendees I spoke with yesterday expressed a deep skepticism that her agenda is truly achievable.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think everything she puts out will get done. The Senate is the Senate,\u201d Kolbi Brown, a 33-year-old hospital program manager, told me, referring to the GOP\u2019s majority in the chamber. \u201cI understand that it\u2019s a system and she\u2019s only a part of it.\u201d\n\nBrown said he was leaning toward voting for Warren but remained \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d that Congress would enact such a far-reaching agenda. \u201cI think she speaks the truth,\u201d Brown said of Warren. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a big boulder to push up the hill.\u201d\n\nBrown was attending the speech with his colleague, Rhonda Trousdale, a 53-year-old physician who told me that she and her friends call Warren \u201cthe kindergarten teacher\u201d because of her ability to explain and boil down complex topics during the financial crisis. \u201cShe understands that things are really complicated,\u201d Trousdale said.\n\nI asked whether Trousdale believed that Warren could accomplish many of her goals if elected president. She paused. \u201cThey\u2019re ambitious,\u201d she replied. \u201cProbably when she gets in office she\u2019ll find that a lot of that is unrealistic.\u201d\n\nA pair of public-school teachers, Elizabeth Sweeney and Christine Ellrodt, both 59, hadn\u2019t firmly committed to Warren, but they said they were attracted to her in part because of her detailed policy plans. \u201cShe seems to have really thought about everything,\u201d Ellrodt told me. \u201cI love the fact that she has a plan for everything. I really do.\u201d\n\nWhen the question turned to how realistic Warren\u2019s ideas were, however, both women were unsure. Sweeney noted the uncertainty about the makeup of Congress. \u201cAll these executive orders isn\u2019t the way to go either,\u201d she told me, referring to the habit of recent presidents trying to go around recalcitrant lawmakers by acting unilaterally. \u201cAt least she has some ideas and we\u2019re not starting from scratch,\u201d Sweeney said of Warren.\n\nThe gap between the scale of Warren\u2019s agenda and the difficulty in enacting it could be a challenge for her as the primary rolls on, as it is for her main competitor on the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The current front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, is pitching himself as a dealmaker, not a disruptor, who can forge consensus in Congress and build on the achievements of Barack Obama\u2019s administration. Warren\u2019s also battling doubts about her ability to beat Donald Trump, as Democrats worry about whether her agenda is too far left for the country, whether Republicans will succeed in attacking her past attempts to claim Native American ancestry, and whether sexism in the electorate will keep yet another woman from the Oval Office.", "description": "At a New York City rally, supporters of the senator from Massachusetts expressed a deep skepticism that her agenda is truly achievable.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_1168763365/facebook.jpg?1568736995", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
