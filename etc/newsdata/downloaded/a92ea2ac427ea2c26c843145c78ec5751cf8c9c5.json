REUTERS/Mark Schiefelbein/Pool/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Matt Pottinger, the White House\u2019s senior Asia adviser, is expected to become the top deputy for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, two senior administration officials said on Friday.\n\nPottinger, who is likely to take up his new post of deputy national security adviser within days, is a former journalist and ex-U.S. Marine who has helped forge China and North Korea policy since Trump took office in January 2017.\n\nHe played a key role in arranging Trump\u2019s summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a diplomatic engagement that has made little progress toward persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPottinger\u2019s appointment was expected to be announced as early as Friday, just days after Trump named O\u2019Brien, a veteran foreign policy hand who had served as U.S. hostage negotiator, to replace John Bolton as national security adviser.\n\nTrump and the hawkish Bolton had differences over key foreign policy challenges such as Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea.\n\nPottinger has a degree in Chinese studies from the University of Massachusetts and is fluent in Mandarin. He worked as a correspondent for Reuters in Beijing from 1998 to 2001 before moving to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn 2005, he joined the Marine Corps, where he served as a military intelligence officer, with postings in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he worked with General Michael Flynn, who was briefly Trump\u2019s national security adviser in 2017, and co-wrote a report with him on improving intelligence gathering in the conflict.", "description": "Matt Pottinger, the White House's senior Asia adviser, is expected to become the top deputy for U.S. President Donald Trump's new national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, two senior administration officials said on Friday.", "authors": ["Matt Spetalnick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432075625&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1VD", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
