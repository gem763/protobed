Growth likely slowed for the second quarter in a row.\n\nHere\u2019s are five things to watch in third-quarter GDP, the official scorecard for the U.S. economy, when the preliminary estimate is published by the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Analysts polled by MarketWatch predict growth tapered off to 1.6% from 2% in the prior quarter.\n\nConsumers still king\n\nThere\u2019s no way Americans could keep spending like they did in the spring, when outlays surged 4.6%. Since 2000 consumer spending has risen an average of 2.4% a quarter.\n\nWall Street DJIA, -0.07% forecasts spending will increase between 2.5% and 3% in the third quarter. Still pretty good, and a good sign for an economy heavily dependent on consumers. Almost 70% of U.S. economic activity is tied to household spending.\n\nRead: Consumer sentiment shows Americans still optimistic despite slowing economy\n\n\n\nBusinesses back off\n\nThe trade war with China dented the confidence of businesses more than it affected households.\n\nCEOs and small-business owners cut back on hiring and investment in the third quarter and are more hesitant to make big plans until the dispute is resolved. Many firms have experienced disruptions in supply lines or faced higher costs owing to stiff U.S. tariffs and retaliatory Chinese sanctions.\n\nDeclining investment in equipment and structures such as drilling rigs or office space is likely to weigh heavily on gross domestic product, shaving as much as one percentage point off growth.\n\nHigher trade gap no help\n\nThe U.S. trade gap appears to have widened slightly in the third quarter as imports outpaced exports. If so, a bigger trade gap will cut GDP further down to size\n\nProduction reduction\n\nMany businesses scaled back production of goods and services, especially those that do a lot of business overseas. Higher import tariffs, a weakening global economy and stronger U.S. dollar all combined to dampen demand for American-made goods.\n\nAs a result, the value of inventories or unsold goods likely grew more slowly in the third quarter. That could trim GDP by a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nRead: \u2018We are all screwed!\u2019 The U.S. is like a banana republic, warns money manager\n\nHelp from housing\n\nSix straight quarters of declining investment in new houses is all but certain to come to an end. Tumbling mortgage rates made home buying more affordable during the third quarter and many Americans took advantage.\n\nResidential investment is likely add a few ticks to GDP and could potentially push growth closer to the 2% mark.", "description": "The massive U.S. economy was unable to escape any harm from a trade war with China and a deteriorating global outlook during the summer.
