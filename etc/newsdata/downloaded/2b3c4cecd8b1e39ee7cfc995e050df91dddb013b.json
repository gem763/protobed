In the moment we did that we started having chances and we scored two wonderful goals.\n\n\u201cIn the second half we scored only one goal but we played really good football and I liked it a lot.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Then super run Sadio. Then the third goal \u2013 wonderful.\n\n\u201cAnd we had even better moments that we didn\u2019t finish off. Nice football moments.\u201d\n\nFirmino started among the substitutes as Klopp looked ahead to next week\u2019s Champions League trip to Napoli but he was introduced after just 37 minutes when Divovk Origi went off with an ankle injury. He will have a scan this week while Mane and Robertson will be checked after minor knocks.\n\nLiverpool have now won all five of their games in an outstanding start to the Premier League season but Klopp felt his side were second best in the early stages.\n\nHe said: \u201cI started enjoying it after 25 minutes when we arrived finally in the game. We don\u2019t want to have that but it is not unlikely that it can happen. It was really difficult.\n\n\u201cWhat Newcastle do they do really well. They are always a threat for counter-attacks and it is difficult to suppress them. They are really physically strong.\u201d\n\nNewcastle\u2019s defeat leaves them with just four points but manager Steve Bruce felt his side acquitted themselves well.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey are as good as you get. You can understand why they have not been beaten here for two-and-a-half years, why they are European champions and why they only lost one game last year.\n\n\u201cThey are an excellent, excellent team with pace and creativity, and at the top end of the pitch they can damage you.\n\n\u201cIt has been difficult but we knew it would be difficult and in fits and starts we did OK.\n\n\u201cThe first half hour was crucial and going OK but unfortunately we made a mistake. The second goal in particular was disappointing.\n\n\u201cWhen you come to an arena like this you know they are going to cut you open at times with the attacking players they have got, but we have given the ball away in the middle of the pitch and I am sure Martin (Dubravka) will say he could have done better.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Jurgen Klopp hailed the quality of the goals his Liverpool\u00a0side scored as the Premier League leaders came from behind to beat Newcastle 3-1 at Anfield.
