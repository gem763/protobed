Martha Hayes hears how she made it to the top \u2013 and why she\u2019s not seeking approval from anyone\n\nLike many struggling actors, in her early 20s Constance Wu waited tables and toyed with the idea of getting a proper job. In her case, retraining to be a speech therapist. Wu is visibly embarrassed when I bring it up, which has less to do with her chosen field, and more with her motivation behind it. \u201cIt\u2019s really the most pathetic reason of all,\u201d she says, rolling her eyes.\n\n\u201cI had a boyfriend I was in love with, who wasn\u2019t too psyched with the idea of being with an actress, because it wasn\u2019t stable. He wasn\u2019t like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to be with an actress,\u2019 but he said: \u2018I just want a partner with a stable job.\u2019 I tried it. It didn\u2019t work for me. And that relationship did not end up working out.\u201d\n\nThis was in the early 00s, when Wu was living in New York. By 2010, she had relocated to Los Angeles, where her acting career finally took off with a starring role in the Asian-American sitcom Fresh Off the Boat and a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in last year\u2019s hit romcom, Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nShe started out in community theatre in her home town of Richmond, Virginia, at the age of 12, before training at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute four years later. \u201cThere was no other choice for me in terms of career,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m really sensitive, and in an office culture \u2013 especially one that is often dominated by the patriarchy \u2013 sometimes that does not inspire respect or confidence. I\u2019ve found a profession in which I can use those parts of me rather than being ashamed of them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wu as Rachel Chu in Crazy Rich Asians. Photograph: AP/Warner Bros\n\n\u201cI love what I do. It\u2019s more fun for me than going to a party,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I have a day off, I go to acting class. I\u2019m there with all the other actors who are struggling and waiting tables and trying to become actors, just because it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s where I feel most free.\u201d\n\n\u201cSensitive\u201d is not the impression Wu, 37, gave people earlier this year when she found herself at the centre of a social media storm. On the same day that Fresh Off the Boat \u2013 in which Wu plays the tiger mother-of-three, Jessica Huang \u2013 was renewed for a sixth season, Wu tweeted: \u201cSo upset right now that I\u2019m literally crying. Ugh. Fuck.\u201d She followed it up with a second tweet: \u201cFucking hell.\u201d And then she commented: \u201cDislike\u201d on the show\u2019s official Instagram.\n\nHer defence \u2013 that she was upset, not because of the renewal, but because it would force her to miss out on another project \u201cthat would have challenged me as an artist\u201d more than the \u201cfun and easy and pleasant\u201d Fresh Off the Boat \u2013 only made things worse. Wu\u2019s apology was slated on social media and in opinion pieces and podcasts that even accused her of clumsily referencing the #MeToo movement when she signed off with: \u201cIt\u2019s meaningful when you make the choice to believe women.\u201d\n\nToday, Wu makes another attempt to set the record straight. \u201cI don\u2019t regret being messy and imperfect in public,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I do regret not taking into account how it might have affected people I care about, like the kids on the show. I love them. I had a talk with each kid. I wanted to make sure they knew I acted out of a moment of passion that was not reflective of how I feel about them.\u201dWhen we meet she is in the middle of filming the sixth season, and the cast and crew \u201ccould not be more lovely and supportive,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019m sorry you went through that, and that people think that, but we know who you are.\u2019 Because here\u2019s the thing - we\u2019ve had the same crew for six years. That never happens if you have a diva on set.\u201d\n\nIs Wu wary of social media now? \u201cA bit, but I was never really that much of a social media person anyway. I\u2019m definitely not an influencer, and I\u2019m definitely not seeking more followers or anything like that. I\u2019m not a perfect person and I not only think it\u2019s OK, but I think it\u2019s good to sometimes publicly fail.\u201d\n\nFor someone who describes herself as sensitive, she has an admirable tolerance for haters. \u201cA lot of the time somebody\u2019s mad because they\u2019re hurt,\u201d she says, \u201cand I think you just have to understand that. I don\u2019t want people to get mad but I want people to express their emotions even if they are negative towards me. Expression is just one step towards the larger journey of understanding yourself. Even me, tweeting that in a moment of heat. That\u2019s one step in the larger journey of understanding myself. Human beings are lucky we have the capacity to have emotions. We\u2019re not just eating-and-sleeping machines.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers. Photograph: STXfilms\n\nWu\u2019s latest role is the lead in Hustlers, a comedy-drama inspired by a 2015 article in New York magazine, The Hustlers at Scores by Jessica Pressler. Part social-commentary, part-heist, the film, co-starring Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B and Lizzo, follows a group of savvy strip-club employees who turn the tables on their Wall Street clients after the 2008 economic collapse.\n\n\u201cPeople are like: \u2018What made you want to play a stripper?\u2019 and I\u2019m like: \u2018I didn\u2019t play a stripper; I played a person who works in a strip club for a living,\u2019\u201d says Wu. \u201cI make that distinction because I think people\u2019s occupations are used as identity markers and that leads to a lot of preconceived notions and prejudices. I love that Lorene Scafaria [the director] wasn\u2019t judging these women or thinking that they are their occupations.\u201d\n\nWhat else drew her to the film? \u201cAt the time I was really looking for a movie that was about loneliness, because I think with all the political polarisation that\u2019s going on and the increased amount of time people are spending in front of screens, loneliness ha become pervasive.\n\n\u201cIt was everything I was looking for in a project. But not the stripping part. That wasn\u2019t a part of my decision. I don\u2019t really think of myself with a sexual lens. I think of myself as, like, an artist. Not to say some of these girls aren\u2019t artists, but they are exploiting the culture\u2019s obsession with sexuality. I\u2019ve never really thought of that as something I was good at. On a practical level, I\u2019m definitely not good at dancing. I am great at dancing at weddings, but dancing in a sensual manner is something \u2026 \u201d\n\nThat makes you cringe? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me cringe; it\u2019s just something I\u2019m not skilled in and it makes me self-conscious. But my character, Destiny, isn\u2019t supposed to be as good at it. Jen\u2019s character, Ramona, teaches me. Destiny is a girl who is lonely, and looking for a friend and mentor and she finds it in Ramona.\u201d\n\nThe two women\u2019s friendship is key to the plot, so I wonder what Wu\u2019s relationship was like with Lopez. \u201cMe and Jen,\u201d she smiles wistfully. \u201cI mean, it was the most peaceful set I\u2019ve ever been on. Jen is such a big star that it was amazing to see what a down-to-earth kind of person she was. She\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nI ask the question because it was widely reported that Wu had requested top billing above Lopez.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t demanding anything,\u201d she says with a sigh. \u201cThe reason that happened was because people on the team were calling journalists because they were not putting me in [their stories about the film]. It wasn\u2019t anything I asked them to do.\u201d\n\nSo it was just another example of the media pitting women against one another? \u201cPeople stereotyping us separates us, and when we are not unified it helps the patriarchy stay in power, right? If you\u2019re at a board meeting and there\u2019s only one seat for a woman and all the other seats are for men, it\u2019s not about being a woman - if you think there\u2019s only one seat, it\u2019s going to be competitive. If it\u2019s a board meeting of all women and there\u2019s only one seat for a man, the men will start becoming competitive. It\u2019s about the scarcity, not gender.\n\n\u201cThat was what was really special about Hustlers. Nobody was fighting about the one seat at the table. It was our table. The men in the movie barely have names. It wasn\u2019t written to be their story and that happens to women all the time, where there are no female characters of substance. I really think that is why patriarchy tries to separate us because they know that when we\u2019re together there is nothing more strong and beautiful.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wu in Fresh Off The Boat. Photograph: Fierce Baby Prods/Detective Agency/20th Century Fox/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\nNext up, Wu is slated to produce and star in an adaptation of Rachel Khong\u2019s 2017 novel Goodbye, Vitamin. There are also two Crazy Rich Asians sequels in the pipeline, although Wu is vague about details. \u201cI\u2019m still friends with Jon M Chu [the director]. Last I talked to him, they were still working on the scripts.\u201d\n\nShortly after we speak, however, the news breaks that Adele Lim, the original film\u2019s Chinese-Malaysian scriptwriter, has walked away from the franchise, claiming that she had been offered much less money than a white male counterpart.\n\nHas Crazy Rich Asians improved on-screen diversity? \u201cI think it\u2019s really helped it. It\u2019s exciting to see so many stories by and about Asian-American people,\u201d Wu nods. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the kind of change that\u2019s been happening.\u201d\n\nBut haven\u2019t there been claims that the film was only a springboard for the cast \u2013 who include Gemma Chan, Awkwafina and Henry Golding \u2013 rather than the wider Asian acting community? \u201cAs an actor it\u2019s hard, no matter what, to get your foot in the door,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were times when I was a younger actor and I\u2019d see a part and think: \u2018Oh, I could have played that,\u2019 but they wouldn\u2019t even let me audition because there were too many people. I understand the frustration, and I think the solution is creating more projects so there are more opportunities to get a foot in the door.\u201d\n\nDoes Wu feel she has to be an example for the Asian community? \u201cThe fact that I was able to play humanised Asian-American characters was historic, not because of me, but because of the paucity of content that was before. That\u2019s a statement on the system, not on me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat should have been happening all along. Now that I do have amplification, I try to make the best use of it, I want to do it well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky to have a lot of autonomy over my career,\u201d she continues. \u201cI was a waitress for 10 years and I didn\u2019t have a lot of choice. Right now I\u2019m in a space in my career \u2013 which I might not always be in \u2013 where I have a lot of artistic privilege, so I would like to select roles that push and challenge me. That\u2019s not for everybody. Some people have this privilege and make choices that make them, like, an icon. But that\u2019s not what I want to be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to be an icon,\u201d she says, checking herself. \u201cIt\u2019s just that [it] was never really on my list of goals.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of which, what did her parents \u2013 a science professor and a computer programmer \u2013 say when she told them she wanted to act? \u201cWell, I never told them,\u201d Wu says. \u201cIt just sort of happened. I didn\u2019t ask permission. I just assumed.\u201d\n\nA lot of parents don\u2019t think it\u2019s a proper job and worry it\u2019s not a stable profession, I say. You know \u2013 like your ex. \u201cBut when you\u2019re 18, you don\u2019t have to listen to your parents, so I\u2019d hear them in their worry and I\u2019d understand it was motivated by love, but I also knew myself better than my parents. Nobody knows you better than yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re an artist, you have to do something for a deeper purpose than seeking approval [or] it\u2019s going to be a real rough time for you. You need a stronger core of meaning than that. Seeking whose approval? Seek your own artistic approval. That\u2019s your metric.\u201d\n\nHustlers is out on 13 September.", "description": "Constance Wu stars in new heist movie Hustlers.
