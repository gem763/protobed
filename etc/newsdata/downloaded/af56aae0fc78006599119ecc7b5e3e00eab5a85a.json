No. How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn\u2019t build which cost \u00a315million, that you didn\u2019t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn\u2019t mention,\u201d wrote Clarkson.\n\nHe proceeded to lay into Thunberg about all the amenities she enjoys thanks to previous generations, including his. This includes all the drugs she uses, aid missions to poor countries, and the movies she enjoys, all made by his generation.\n\nHe also included the fact that she sleeps soundly in her bed at night thanks to his generation:\n\nAnd then pause for a moment to consider how soundly you sleep at night, knowing that adults are building and servicing and flying Sweden\u2019s fighter planes. To keep you safe. We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all. So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.\n\nClarkson tells Thunberg that she is, indeed, a spoiled brat thanks in part to her parents doing everything she ordered them to do instead of telling her how the world really works and not everyone gets what they want. The former Top Gear host then let Thunberg in on some reality:\n\nWhat they should have done is point out that life is tragic. Some people are born bright and some are born stupid. Some are beautiful and some are not. Some have rich parents who give them everything but love. Some have poor parents who have nothing to give except love. Now shut up and let them get on with it. This is how the world works. It\u2019s how the world has always worked. And banging your fists on the table won\u2019t change a thing. You\u2019ll learn that when you\u2019ve got a few more years under your belt.\n\nClarkson said that he doesn\u2019t necessarily disagree with Thunberg that the planet is hotter and that it\u2019s possible that mankind has something to do with it, but that pointing fingers and virtue signaling isn\u2019t going to get anything done. In fact, as Clarkson once again points out, the very people Thunberg blames for the problem are busy trying to solve it.\n\nHe then suggested that if Thunberg really wants to help, she should go back to school and study science and join in on the real problem solving:\n\nSomething needs to be done about that. So how\u2019s this for an idea. Get back to school as quickly as possible and work hard in your science lectures. Because science is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes. Many thousands of people who you had the temerity to blame this week are trying to do exactly what you want. So be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it.", "description": "Top Gear\u2019s Jeremy Clarkson Throws Greta Thunberg\u2019s \u201cHow Dare You\u201d Speech Back in Her Face", "authors": ["Brandon Morse", "Elizabeth Vaughn", "Nick Arama", "Dana Pico", "Alex Parker", "Seton Motley", "Posted At Am On September"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5b6e7665-e958-43bb-a246-9cd41b16c76f.jpg"}
