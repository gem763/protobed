Yet, this week the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show us that in 2018, 726 homeless people died across England and Wales; almost two a day.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"This is a shocking indictment of the way some of the most vulnerable people in society have been left to fend for themselves.\n\n\"As homeless health nurses we work every day with those people who have no home to go to, many of whom are suffering the effects of social isolation and drug dependency. Shockingly the ONS figures also show a 55 per cent increase in those who died as a result of drug poisoning.\n\n\"Working on the streets, we meet patients, tend to wounds, deliver mental health interventions, provide welfare advice, and even cancer care, and we feel deep shame for the indignity these people are put through, in life and death.\n\n\"And we also feel anger because many of these deaths are preventable. But as nurses our hands are tied behind our backs.\n\n\"Local authority budgets have been slashed and raids on the public health grant has resulted in swingeing cuts being made to vital drug and alcohol addiction services and mental health support, which we nurses know can be the difference between staying off the streets, and staying alive whilst on them.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"On top of this, there are more than 40,000 nursing vacancies in England alone and the training nurses need to specialise in homeless health is underfunded and not specified.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s clear that despite more people finding themselves on the streets \u2013 this year a record high in the capital - the support made available isn\u2019t even close to matching demand.\n\n\"But this is not just about meeting people\u2019s needs once they end up on the street, the goal should be to eliminate rough sleeping completely.\n\n\"As nurses we believe that housing equals health, and that a safe, secure home, whether that be social housing, or supported accommodation for those who are vulnerable, makes for a happy and healthier life.\n\n\"That\u2019s why The Royal College of Nursing voted this year to pressure the government to end the homeless health crisis. We believe this is not just a moral necessity, but also one that can save the NHS and local authorities money in the long term.\n\n(Image: Googlemaps)\n\n\"Other organisations representing homeless health nurses - the Queen's Nursing Institute, Pathway and the London Network of Nurses and Midwives Homelessness Group are in full agreement, and are co-signing this letter.\n\n\"Our patients cannot be left to endure another winter in which the patient we saw only yesterday is found dead on the street the next morning.\n\n\"We need genuine support and investment for our profession and a commitment to building the homes that will enable people to lead healthy lives instead of a life of destitution.\n\n\"If this doesn\u2019t happen, and fast, our patients will continue to endure countless more winter nights wondering if they will wake up the next.\"\n\nThe letter is also signed by the Queen\u2019s Nursing Institute, Pathway and the London Network of Nurses and Midwives Homelessness Group.\n\nSamantha Dorney-Smith, of homeless health charity Pathway, said homeless health nurses were fronting \u201ca broken system\u201d.\n\nUK homeless figures during a snapshot survey in late 2018 were put at 7,750.\n\nLondon and the North West had the highest numbers of deaths in 2018, with 148 and 103 respectively.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The Royal College of Nursing wants to reverse cuts to addiction, mental health and other support services so 726 preventable deaths can be stopped", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Getty", "Googlemaps"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467334.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Homeless-Figures-Reveal-255000-Have-No-Permanent-Home.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
