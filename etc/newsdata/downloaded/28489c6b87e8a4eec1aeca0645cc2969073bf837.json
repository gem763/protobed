Debate moderator Jorge Ramos began the discussion by calling out the former vice president, bringing up the fact that, as a presidential candidate in 2008, Biden supported wall construction on the southern border.\n\nRamos also brought up the fact that, under the Obama administration, three million foreign nationals were deported under Biden\u2019s watch.\n\n\u201cDid you do anything to prevent those deportations? You\u2019ve been asked this question before and refused to answer. So let me try once again. Are you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations? Why should Latinos trust you?\u201d Ramos asked.\n\nBiden began by calling the comparison between former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump \u201coutrages.\u201d However, Biden then made the bold claim that no people were placed in cages during his White House tenure.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages. We didn\u2019t separate families. We didn\u2019t do all of those things, number one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe word \u201cpeople\u201d was likely a misstatement by the former vice president. To suggest that no people were locked up by Border Patrol or other Customs and Border Protection officials during Obama\u2019s eight-year tenure would suggest that absolutely no border enforcement took place under his watch.\n\nA quick glance at Customs and Border Protection data show thousands of foreign nationals were apprehended by Border Patrol each year Obama occupied the White House.\n\nIt may be more fair to assume that Biden meant to say \u201ckids\u201d rather than \u201cpeople.\u201d Numerous Democrats, for example, have balked at the immigration enforcement against family units, which has in the past resulted in the temporary caging and separation of immigrant children.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "But he did.", "authors": ["Jason Hopkins"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4wLH9sTyzTg150gfYi44og--~B/aD05NzE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/1df8d3f11756c08cf7b3c42a7e1434fe", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
