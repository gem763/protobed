We have followed a certain route and play according to the stats and the way the game is being refereed currently and what it gives you is short term good results on the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cWe certainly accept that there are some things in our game that we need to improve and we take that on the chin.\n\n\u201cBut we have put ourselves in a position to win the World Cup ... which is where we want to be.\u201d", "description": "Winger Cheslin Kolbe is likely to be back in the South Africa matchday squad for their Rugby World Cup final against England in Yokohama on Saturday, coach Rassie Erasmus said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Greg Stutchbury", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446104852&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0F2-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
