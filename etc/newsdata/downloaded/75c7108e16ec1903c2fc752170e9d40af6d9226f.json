That could include offering customers the means to restrict the availability of online shops at night through their account settings, or the option to cancel night-time purchases the following morning if they\u2019ve bought things they later regret.\u201d\n\nTo help vulnerable people resist temptation, the charity recommends using apps such as Shopper Stopper, a resource devised by the institute that enables people to block specific online shops or restrict spending at certain times.", "description": "Night-time online shoppers are \u201cat risk of exploitation\u201d from retailers, a mental health charity has found.\u00a0 The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, founded by personal finance expert Martin Lewis, has criticised retailers after it found that companies often target vulnerable people through late-night promotional emails.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/16/istock-870551868.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
