I still wonder. In any case, year upon year of capricious bullying and humiliation followed.\u2019\n\nThe 31-year-old musician then discusses the impact his mental health has had on his music career, describing how he became \u2018so self-obsessed and isolated that I wasn\u2019t the success I seemed to be on paper\u2019.\n\nBlake reasons that a \u2018chasm grew\u2019 between his alias \u2018who seemed in control of everything\u2019 and \u2018a man-child who for many years was hurting, spiralling, never leaving the house\u2019.\n\nBlake said he \u2018wondered for years whether I had some behaviour disorder\u2019 (Picture: Rebecca Sapp/WireImage)\n\nBlake recalls that he eventually arrived at a point where he wasn\u2019t \u2018taking any care of [himself] what-so-ever until [he] was in a black depression, experiencing daily panic attacks, hallucinations and an existential crisis.\n\n\u2018I was asking questions like \u201cWhat is the point of me?\u201d and saying I didn\u2019t want to live.\u2019\n\nThe London-born artist added that he still \u2018wasn\u2019t sure\u2019 if he fully believed that he is \u2018entitled to be depressed or sad at all, because I\u2019m white and cisgender and male\u2019.\n\n\u2018Life for people like me is undoubtedly the easiest of any group,\u2019 he posits. \u2018But my privilege didn\u2019t make me want to stick around, and it makes me feel even more embarrassed for having let myself go.\u2019\n\nBlake recently praised his girlfriend Jameela Jamil for her work on Assume Form (Picture: SplashNews.com)\n\nBlake also credits in the essay the support of his girlfriend Jameela Jamil, who yesterday spoke about her own mental health and recalled the time she attempted to take her own life six years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I urge you to hang on just a bit longer and ask for help if you need it,\u2019 Jamil wrote on Twitter in a post marking World Mental Health Day.\n\n\u2018Because things can turn around. I promise.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
