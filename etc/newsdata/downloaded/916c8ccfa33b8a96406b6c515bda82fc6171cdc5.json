I\u2019ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEpstein\u2019s death has been shrouded in mystery after the two guards who were supposed to be monitoring the area of his cell allegedly fell asleep at the time \u2013 and two security cameras aimed at the cell malfunctioned at the same time.\n\nMother frantically stabbed pit bull as it mauled her son, 4, to death\n\nBaden said prison security had experienced a \u2018total breakdown\u2019 in procedure. He said that his study was not yet complete, adding that he hoped to examine the sheet, or cloth, was used in Epstein\u2019s death.\n\nHe said if someone killed Epstein \u2018would have their DNA all over the ligature,\u2019 but added, \u2018We don\u2019t have those results yet.\u2019\n\nBaden said Mark Epstein hired him because, \u2018The brother is concerned that if [Epstein] was murdered, then other people who have information might be at risk.\u2019\n\n\u2018If they think he has information, his life could be in jeopardy.\u2019", "description": "New York City's famed former chief medical examiner Dr Michael Baden insisted Wednesday that Epstein appears to have been killed.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1572446061_1572449129.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
