The focus of the probe is unclear, but the investigation is being led by the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California, according to the Journal.\n\nJuul has faced a number of legal challenges in recent months, as government outrage grows over hundreds of illnesses linked to e-cigarette use, including seven deaths.\n\nA number of federal authorities are already investigating Juul. The Federal Trade Commission and a few state attorneys general are focusing on the company\u2019s marketing practices and whether they purposefully sought to target minors. The Food and Drug Administration is also actively probing Juul, but little is known about its investigation.\n\nThe US Surgeon General declared vaping among minors an epidemic last year, and organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned people to stop using e-cigarettes entirely as concerns over vape-induced illnesses have grown.\n\nThere\u2019s also a looming federal ban on flavored vaping products generally. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced that his administration would seek to ban flavored vapes through the FDA, although the agency has yet to issue rule-making for the ban. \u201cNot only is it a problem overall, but really specifically with respect for children,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cWe may very well have to do something very, very strong about it.\u201d\n\nJuul did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The focus of the probe is unclear so far, but the investigation is being led by the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California.
