All the landing participants safely reached the shore.\"\n\nThis wasn't the Russian navy's first run-in with walruses.\n\nThis past May, photos believed to be from 2006 surfaced online of a large walrus napping on top of a Russian submarine.", "description": "A landing craft carrying researchers ashore from a Russian navy tugboat was attacked and apparently sunk by walruses during an Arctic expedition.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d88ea302e22af1e02620d95-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
