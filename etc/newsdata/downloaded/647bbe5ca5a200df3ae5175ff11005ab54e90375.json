A sixth, Yakov Gakkel, is undergoing sea trials.\n\nA Novatek spokeswoman declined to comment immediately.\n\nDue to the Arctic conditions, the ice-breaking ARC7s are critical for carrying LNG produced at Yamal westwards to Europe and eastwards to Asia.\n\nThere are currently 14 such tankers in operation with Dynagas (N: ), Sovcomflot and Mitsui OSK Lines (T: ) owning the others.", "description": "U.S. sanctions on COSCO hit Teekay's Yamal LNG tanker JV", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8T0MG_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
