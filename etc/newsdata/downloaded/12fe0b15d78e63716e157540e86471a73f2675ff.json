The alleged victim, identified by Turning Point USA as Hayden Williams, held up his cell phone and began filming the two men who were allegedly harassing him. One of the two men knocked over the table, police said, and then punched Williams several times, causing injuries to his face. Much of the incident was captured on a witness' cellphone, but it was unclear what, if anything, Williams may have said before the attack.\n\nThe suspects had left by the time police arrived.\n\nAlthough Williams was helping Turning Point USA, he is not actually a member of the group. Williams is campus representative for Leadership Institute, according to Campus Reform, a conservative news site that the institute operates.\n\nA witness told Fox News the recruitment table had a sign that said: \"Hate Crime Hoaxes Hurt Real Victims,\" in reference to the case of \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett, who is accused of staging a bias attack against himself in downtown Chicago last month.\n\nOn its website, Campus Reform, which interviewed Williams, reported that the alleged attacker cursed at the activist, calling him a racist and threatened to shoot him.\n\nThe Berkeley incident is the latest in a growing series of ideological clashes that have turned violent on college campuses. Conservative groups claim students who lean to the right have been targeted for harassment and even assault over their views.\n\n\u201cCollege campuses have become increasingly unsafe for conservatives,\u201d Charlie Kirk, the founder and executive director of Turning Point USA, told Fox News. \u201cOur amazing Turning Point USA team was talking and then confronted by the hateful left which resulted in the assault and punching in the face just because of a difference of opinion. If the attacker was wearing a MAGA hat, this would be classified as a hate crime and all over every news channel.\u201d\n\nIOWA COLLEGE REJECTS CONSERVATIVE GROUP'S STUDENT CHAPTER\n\nGuillermina Castro, a UC-Berkeley freshman who is trying to establish a Turning Point USA chapter on the campus, said it was her idea to set up the table to offer information to potential recruits.\n\nShe said that harassment of conservative students is so common these days that she felt nervous about leaving Williams at the table alone as she sat in a class.\n\nWhen she returned to the table, she found her concerns had been well-founded.\n\n\u201cI saw our sign ripped up, all our papers were on the floor, Hayden was covering his [injured] eye,\u201d Castro told Fox News. \u201cI said \u2018Oh my God, what happened?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that a guy had just punched him in the face.\u201d\n\nCRAZIEST CAMPUS MELTDOWNS, PROFESSORIAL RANTS FROM 2018\n\nShe added that when she tweeted about the incident, she received hateful messages from people applauding the violence.\n\n\u201cOne woman called me a white supremacist,\u201d she said. \u201cI said \u2018Wait, I\u2019m Latina!\u2019\u201d\n\nTRUMP SLAMS JUSSIE SMOLLETT FOR SMEARING SUPPORTERS WITH 'RACIST AND DANGEROUS COMMENTS'\n\nCastro said that while she has come to expect taunts from other students over her political views, Tuesday\u2019s violence had a chilling effect.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d expect students at Berkeley to be smarter, to be more open about different points of view.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCampus Reform quoted Williams as saying: \u201cSome students nearby tabling were laughing, even one guy was smiling while I was being attacked and trying to hand me his flyer as a joke. The idea is free speech has consequences.... which include you getting assaulted if they find you promoting ideas others don't agree with.\u201d\n\nAlex Szarka, a junior who happened to be passing by when the altercation broke out, filmed it to ensure that there would be documentation and that the man who punched Williams is held accountable, he told Fox News.\n\n\u201cI was walking by when I saw it, it escalated so quickly,\u201d Szarka said. \u201cThe Turning Point USA table had signs that on a campus like Berkeley, would be seen as provocative. I was surprised to see [the reaction] be this bad. I would like to see the guy get arrested, and expelled immediately. In any other situation, without the politics, this would absolutely be a very well-publicized thing. I was in disbelief.\u201d", "description": "University of California police is asking for the public\u2019s help in tracking down a man who allegedly assaulted the member of a conservative group, Turning Point USA, who was at a table Tuesday afternoon filled with recruitment materials.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Llorente"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/LEFTIST-VIOLENCE-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-21"}
