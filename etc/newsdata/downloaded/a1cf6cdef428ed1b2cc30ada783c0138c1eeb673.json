The yen jumped after a Bank of Japan policy decision.\n\nConstruction-company shares and banks led the Europe Stoxx 600 higher, while contracts on the three main U.S. equity indexes dropped. Hong Kong shares fell, Shanghai equities edged up and China\u2019s yuan dropped as traders weighed the odds of the People\u2019s Bank of China lowering borrowing costs.\n\nTreasuries climbed while European government bonds slipped. The yen rose the most in three weeks after the BOJ left its policy settings unchanged while noting rising risks. The pound nudged higher before the Bank of England\u2019s policy decision Thursday. The Swiss National Bank held its policy rate and deposit rate at minus 0.75%, and the franc strengthened.\n\nThursday\u2019s slate of policy decisions, hot on the heels of the Fed cut, provide fresh clues as to how far the world\u2019s central banks are willing to go to support growth amid soft economic data and trade uncertainty.

The Fed rate cut and briefing by its chairman \u201cdoesn\u2019t really change the narrative that investors are going to need more than that from some governing body to give a central thesis that they feel comfortable sticking with for a while,\u201d she said.\n\nElsewhere, crude oil futures were steady and gold was little changed. Australia\u2019s dollar slumped after the unemployment rate rose. Norway\u2019s central bank delivered its fourth interest-rate increase in a year, while policy makers in Indonesia cut interest rates for third month in row.\n\nThese are some key events to keep an eye on this week:\n\nBank of England decides monetary policy Thursday.Friday is quadruple witching day for U.S. markets.
