Established in 1934, the Ex-Im Bank extended loans to foreign countries to buy U.S. goods, and operated with minimal controversy until earlier this decade.\n\nMcHenry\u2019s Tuesday warning comes after a deal he struck with Waters to reboot Ex-Im fell apart in June over objections from Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are broadly supportive of Ex-Im, but many GOP lawmakers argue that the bank extends too much financing to Chinese firms and distorts markets with \u201ccrony capitalism.\"\n\nProgressives, meanwhile, are pushing for an amendment to limit loans to companies involved in fossil fuel extraction, production and distribution, citing the increasing damage of climate change.\n\nDemocratic support for a bill unveiled by Waters and McHenry in June crumbled over a provision that banned Ex-Im from issuing loans to any company that is more than 25 percent owned by the Chinese government.\n\nRepublicans insisted that the provision was crucial to curb China\u2019s push to dominate the global economy and develop insurmountable technological advantages over the U.S.\n\n\"Ex-Im support for the Chinese government is unacceptable to me and my Republican colleagues, but apparently a priority for certain Democrats,\" McHenry said. \"If we report this bill out absent the China provisions, will be on the wrong side of history and this long term conflict we have with Chinese aggression.\"\n\nBut some Democrats argued that the ban was too expansive and covered noncontroversial commerce between the U.S. and China.

You're not friend of the bank, sir. And you've always wanted it to go away, sir. And this is another means for you to achieve that objective to make it go away,\" Heck argued.\n\nMcHenry shot back that he voted against 2015 efforts to overrule GOP leadership to reopen Ex-Im over procedural issues, and ripped Heck for \"never\" asking why.\n\nThough Waters on Tuesday introduced an updated version of the bill meant to address some of those concerns, McHenry said the offer does \"a huge disservice to the bank and to small exporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill says to their competitors, \u2018We want China to continue to dominate the United States now and in the future,\u2019 and I think this is a huge missed opportunity,\u201d McHenry said.\n\nHe added that he has \u201ca great deal of certainty that we will be able to keep the bank open [with] bipartisan cooperation between the House and the Senate and the White House.\u201d\n\nIf both chambers and the White House cannot strike a full bipartisan deal before government funding expires on Nov. 21, lawmakers will be forced to renew funding for Ex-Im without making long-sought structural changes.\n\nUpdated at 4:52 p.m.", "description": "House lawmakers have struggled to reach a deal to reboot the Ex-Im Bank after undoing a 2015 push from conservatives to defund and hinder the trade subsidizer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/watersmaxine_mchenrypatrick_071719gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
