What had seemed to be a near certain outbreak of war, after Donald Trump\u2019s statement on Sunday night appeared to clear the way for a Turkish assault on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), had quickly turned into yet another chapter in a drawn out series of threats and defiance between Turkey and the Kurds.\n\nThe backlash in the US and Trump\u2019s apparent volte-face appears to have the led the Turks to tread carefully, its powerful air force instead bombing targets across the border in Iraq.\n\nPlay Video 1:44 Trump threatens to \u2018decimate\u2019 Turkey\u2019s economy if it injures US troops \u2013 video\n\nKurds travelling to Rojava \u2013 the name they use for the north-east Syrian province \u2013 said the Turkish foreign minister\u2019s statement that any operation would be \u201ctemporary\u201d suggested that Ankara had been spooked by the pushback against Trump from the US national security establishment.\n\n\u201cErdo\u011fan thought he could do what he wanted yesterday,\u201d said one Kurdish vendor travelling to the city of Qamishli from Iraq. \u201cThen he woke up to a different reality. Maybe the Americans are not going to abandon us after all.\u201d\n\nGhazi Ali, a Syrian Kurdish driver, said roads in the province appeared normal. \u201cPeople are panicking, but life is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is waiting to see what will happen. There\u2019s a lot of talk on social media, but not much is actually happening.\u201d\n\nAnother Rojava resident, Noureddine Issa said: \u201cWe hear the Turks are going to attack. Life is normal in the market places and streets for now, but we\u2019re waiting and worried.\u201d\n\nOfficials in the largest Isis detention centre in the territory reported more unrest than normal, as rumours grew of an imminent incursion by Turkish forces. \u201cSince last week we\u2019ve recorded the highest number of attacks on camp guards,\u201d said one local official. \u201cThe camp is really volatile.\u201d\n\nA woman in one of the internment camps said: \u201cWhen we asked them [the guards] what will happen they start cussing out the Americans and cussing out Trump. And when we ask them about our fate, they say in kind of a joking way: \u2018we will just spray you down [with bullets]\u2019. In every joke there\u2019s some truth.\u201d\n\n'We deserve support': Reinvented north-east Syria strives for stability Read more\n\nThe fate of the detention camps remains central to discussions about what might happen if and when Turkey carries through with its threats to invade. The four detention centres in north-east Syria hold close to 90,000 people \u2013 among them thousands of ideologues who still pay heed to Isis teachings. \u201cIf they get out, there will be chaos,\u201d said the woman. \u201cThe guards know I\u2019m not Isis. We have a respect for each other, but it only goes so far. And I\u2019m really scared.\u201d\n\nThe threat of new displacement also hangs over civilian communities, many of which would likely flee in the face of Turkish troops. The relative safety of the Iraqi Kurdish border seems a likely destination for many \u2013 but the Kurdish region of Iraq has absorbed hundreds of thousands of refugees from earlier in the war. Authorities there say they would struggle to cope with any new influx.\n\nMasoud Barzani, the elder statesman of the region and a former KRG president, took to Twitter to warn against an invasion. \u201cWe are very concerned about the recent developments in Western Kurdistan,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are in contact with several channels and we will do our utmost to ensure that the people of Rojava are not subjected to any more disasters.\u201d", "description": "Markets still bustling in north-east Syria despite fears of an imminent Turkish invasion", "authors": ["Martin Chulov"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/6308.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=70b20383a25c6418a3bc1acf5737cc40", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
