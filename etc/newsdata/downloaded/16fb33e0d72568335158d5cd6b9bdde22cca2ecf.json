Absence of buying interest and easy condition on Madhya Pradesh oil market mainly kept prices unchanged. A majority of traders adopted wait and watch move because of weak trend in American soya digam prices, sources said Friday. ***** VIDARBHA MARKETS OILS * Soyabean, cottonseed, groundnut loose, groundnut refined, sunflower refined, linseed, rapeseed, castor and coconut KP oil ruled steady here in sluggish trading activity. * Traders expect nearly steady trend in major edible and non-edible oils here. SOYMEAL * Soymeal prices today ruled steady here on subdued demand from local traders. Good recovery in international soymeal prices also affected sentiment. SOYABEAN * Soyabean prices showed upward tendency in Nagpur Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) on increased demand from local crushing plants. Fresh rise in Madhya Pradesh soyabean prices and reported demand from South-based plants also boosted prices. About 4,000 soyabean bags reported for auction in Nagpur APMC, according to sources.
