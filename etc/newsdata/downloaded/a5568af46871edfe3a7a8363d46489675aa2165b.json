The champion kept his WBA and WBO lightweight titles and picked up the vacant WBC belt to move closer to the undisputed status at 135 pounds that he will surely clinch next year.\n\nHaving left Anthony Crolla mesmerised earlier this year, it was Campbell\u2019s turn to try crack the code and show signs that the brilliant Ukrainian is indeed human.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Getty Images 33/33 Lomachenko vs Campbell And so it proved as he clinched a 119-108, 119-108, 118-109 unanimous decision. Action Images via Reuters\n\nA patient Lomachenko examined Campbell from the first bell, leaving the challenger to seize the centre of the ring and throw up a variety of angles that may not have made his opponent flinch, but certainly forced him to reach for a more intricate way through.\n\nA combination of Campbell\u2019s southpaw stance and range saw Lomachenko fail to immediately find his rhythm, handing Campbell encouragement and likely a share of the first few rounds.\n\nBut like a bolt of lightning, Lomachenko found his target in the third, a clean straight left unsettled Campbell, who did well to earn a nod of the head from the Ukrainian after responding with a smart uppercut of his own. This was unfolding into an intense, compelling chess match.\n\nAnd Loma began to swipe away at Campbell\u2019s body, a trend that would define this fight, ensuring his opponent\u2019s escape off the ropes became gradually slower.\n\nDespite Campbell\u2019s considerable length for a lightweight, Lomachenko\u2019s brief stay inside the pocket was testing trainer Shane McGuigan\u2019s plan to its limits. And a crushing left hook finally removed Campbell from his smooth approach in the fifth, with body shots quickly raining in before the bell saved the challenger as he briefly staggered back to his corner.\n\nBut Campbell was undeterred, firing back whenever the bank of momentum he had built up appeared to be disappearing. After catching Lomachenko in the corner with a smart combination in the seventh, the Ukrainian stormed out like a bull, beautifully mixing up his arsenal of shots as Campbell incredibly weathered another storm.\n\nMimicking the onslaught to the body appeared to stem the tide as Lomachenko was forced to swerve the instinctive counters from Campbell as the bout caught fire once again in the eighth.\n\nA brief pause in the action occurred as the 10th started, with Lomachenko\u2019s face coated in vaseline, before the flow of the fight quickly resumed. Campbell\u2019s resilience continued to defy belief as the wincing attacks continued, but his monotonous jab and instinctive footwork proved as effective as almost any weapon thrown in the way of the mercurial Lomachenko during his short, 15-fight professional career.\n\nCampbell\u2019s chin stood up to the test too after a thudding, clean straight left in the 11th, but moments later Campbell would be rising from the canvas; bludgeoned by more energy-sapping work to the body, he survived the onslaught to reach the 12th.\n\nA stern word from referee Victor Loughlin for a low shot would not deny Lomachenko one last foray at taking out the ballsy Campbell, who tricked his way to the final bell with an interpretation of a wrestling move, hooking the leg of his opponent as he tumbled over.\n\nHis feat earned the respect of the outstanding champion, yet provided no more evidence of how to solve the mystery of Lomachenko.", "description": "The majestic Vasyl Lomachenko produced a relentless barrage of body shots to outclass Luke Campbell and retain his world titles.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/31/23/Lomachenko-Campbell-10.JPG"}
