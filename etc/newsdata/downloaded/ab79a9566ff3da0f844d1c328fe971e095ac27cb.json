Not some tournament. Not these other kids, who might do this better or that better. \u2026 None of those people, and none of those things, gets to be the author of your story. Just you. So think real hard about it.\n\n\"Take your time. And then you go and write what you want to write. But just know that this story \u2014 it's yours.\"\n\nTo this day, \"it's the best advice I've ever gotten,\" Curry writes. \"And anytime I've needed it \u2014 anytime I've been snubbed, or underrated, or even flat-out disrespected \u2014 I've just remembered those words, and I've persevered.\"\n\nBefore establishing himself as one of the greatest basketball players in the world, Curry was overlooked by virtually every big Division I college basketball program, including Virginia Tech, where his dad Dell Curry played before his successful NBA career. He ended up at Davidson College, a small liberal arts school in North Carolina, where the team \"shared a practice court with the volleyball team\" and was constantly reminded that \"we were not playing Big-Time College Hoops,\" recalls Curry.\n\nEven after making a splash at Davidson and leading the team on a remarkable March Madness run to the sweet sixteen, NBA draft analysts doubted him when he entered the 2009 draft.\n\nIt was during those times in particular when Curry would repeat to himself: \"This is no one's story to write but mine. It's no one's story but mine.\"", "description": "Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry recalls a time his mom sat him down at a Holiday Inn Express in Tennessee and gave him \"the best advice\" he has ever gotten.
