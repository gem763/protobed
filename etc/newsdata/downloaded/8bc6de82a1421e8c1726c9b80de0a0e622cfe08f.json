Nikolaj Ehlers added an empty-goal with 1:36 remaining in the third.\n\nFlames forward Adam Ruzicka had tied the game 1-1 at the six-minute mark of the third.\n\nLaurent Brossoit made 22 saves for the Jets (2-1-1). Cam Talbot stopped 25-of-28 shots for the Flames (2-2-1).\n\nBrossoit was playing in his second pre-season game. Both were wins and he's only allowed two goals.\n\n\"I was working on a lot of stuff over the summer,\" Brossoit said. \"I just feel pretty stable and pretty confident right now.\"\n\nTalbot welcomed a full game in net, despite Roslovic using a rebound off a Tucker Poolman shot from the point to open the game's scoring.\n\nCalgary Flames goaltender Cam Talbot leaves his crease to get the puck ahead of Winnipeg Jets' Kristian Vesalainen during first period action.

I thought I was tracking the puck pretty well the rest of the game.\"\n\nWinnipeg forward Logan Shaw provided some highlights in the scoreless second period.\n\nShaw fired a shot that Talbot quickly stretched out his pad to save, then he broke up Calgary forward Austin Czarnik's breakaway that came after teammate Logan Stanley's giveaway.\n\nWith Jets defenceman Dmitry Kulikov in the penalty box for boarding Flames forward Glenn Gawdin, Ruzicka tied it up by flipping the puck over Brossoit's stretched pad.\n\nAdam Ruzicka of the Flames scores on Winnipeg Jets goaltender Laurent Brossoit during the third period. (Fred Greenslade/Canadian Press )\n\nGawdin, who slid into the corner and hit more of his shoulder than his head against the boards, said after the game he was fine.\n\nWheeler regained Winnipeg's lead with a fortunate re-directed puck.\n\nJets defenceman Anthony Bitetto's shot went off the skate of Oliver Kylington and the puck slid over to Wheeler, who deposited it into an open side of the net at 9:43.\n\nLuoto then deflected in Stanley's shot at 10:55 to stretch the lead. Ehlers sealed the win at 18:24.\n\nWinnipeg had Mark Scheifele and Wheeler back together on the top line with Ehlers.\n\nThat benefited Calgary's young players, Flames head coach Bill Peters said.\n\nWinnipeg Jets' Nikolaj Ehlers reaches for a rebound. (Fred Greenslade/Canadian Press )\n\n\"They got some good shifts against a real good line in the Scheifele line so it's an eye-opener,\" Peters said. \"Now it gives you an idea where you have to be to be able to play in this league.\"\n\nCalgary left a lot of veteran forwards at home, but its defence included T.J. Brodie, Michael Stone and Andrew MacDonald on his professional tryout contract.\n\nThe Jets travel to take on the Flames again Tuesday.", "description": "Blake Wheeler had a goal and one assist as the Winnipeg Jets defeated the Calgary Flames 4-1 in exhibition play Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293544.1569206902!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jets-flames-092219.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
