The election call will immediately shut down Parliament and send lawmakers and challengers out to campaign for 338 seats in the House of Commons ahead of a Oct. 21 vote.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThose individual races, taken together, will determine which party gets to form Canada's next government, but in many ways the campaign will be a referendum on Trudeau's first term.\n\nHe took office in November 2015 and sailed through the first half of his post. He was the refugee-hugging, feminism-celebrating, magazine-gracing coverboy who looked in every way capable of taking up the mantle of a global progressive leader.\n\nBut he has stumbled in several ways since then and now faces an exceptionally close race, with polls showing his Liberals running neck-and-neck with the Conservative Party.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Canada Be the first to know about significant political and policy developments that impact the world's most significant bilateral relationship, with alerts and analysis arriving directly to your inbox.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer is a low-key, socially conservative father of five. Until recently, Scheer was rarely in the partisan spotlight. Elected to the House of Commons in 2004, he spent most of his first decade as an MP holding the apolitical job of enforcing procedural rules. Scheer flung himself into the Conservative Party leadership race with a relatively low profile in 2017 as party members\u2019 second choice. Then in a marathon 13-ballot contest came from behind to overtake the front runner.\n\nThe prime minister and cabinet come from the party that controls the legislature. Several major national parties are running in the election, and the one that scoops up the most seats in House of Commons is almost certain to form the next government.\n\nTrudeau's Liberals and Scheer's Conservatives, running atop the polls, hope to take a majority of the seats, giving them a strong hold on power. But the tight polling could be an indication that the winning party won't hold a majority, which would force the victor to work with opposition parties to form a government.\n\nClimate issues will be key\n\n\n\nThe country's politics are traditionally split over energy and environmental issues. In this election, however, they could be far more divisive than usual.\n\nTrudeau has tried straddling the contradictory demands of the Canadian electorate. Canadians have told pollsters they want both more oil development and more action to address climate change \u2014 and the prime minister has tried to promise both. That balancing act has been awkward at times and led to attacks from opponents.\n\nScheer wants to scrap Trudeau's carbon tax-and-rebate system and reverse several fossil fuel regulations.\n\nThere's such fury over Trudeau's climate actions that there's a growing separatist movement in Alberta, the country's leading oil-producing province. Threats against the Liberal environment minister who introduced the carbon tax have become so frequent she's beefed up her personal security.\n\nBut Trudeau faces challengers on the left, too. The New Democratic and Green parties dismiss as insufficient the prime minister's response to climate change. They also charge that he's been too pipeline-friendly. While Trudeau has opposed some energy projects, he's also supported two major pipelines \u2014 one in Canada, the Trans Mountain expansion, and one through the U.S., Keystone XL, both of which have been stalled.\n\nWhat it takes to win\n\n\n\nTwo regions will be especially critical to the outcome: the suburbs of Toronto, the largest city in Canada's most populous province of Ontario; and French-speaking Quebec, Canada's second-largest province by population and Trudeau's home turf.\n\nElections in Quebec can be wild affairs with hard-to-predict waves that crest suddenly and wipe out dozens of incumbents. That has been the case in two of the last three elections.\n\nTo win, Trudeau's Liberals must perform well in Toronto's suburbs and in Quebec, and the prime minister must also keep left-leaning voters united behind his party. In Canada's multi-party system, losing votes on the left could cost his Liberals numerous seats \u2014 and the election.\n\nTrudeau has attempted to shore up support on the left by promising big-ticket items. He's hinted that an announcement is coming on a national plan to cover prescription drugs, despite preemptive attacks from Conservatives who charge that such an initiative will be too expensive.\n\nTrudeau also has tried to paint Scheer as a social conservative out of step with Canadian values.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Scheer, in a bid to put hot-button social issues to rest before the election, recently promised not to overturn Canada's long-held rights to abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Conservative leader enters the campaign season with one major disadvantage against Trudeau. While the Conservatives have held small leads in the polls overall, they're actually trailing in the provinces with the most seats \u2014 where the election will be decided.\n\nBut Scheer holds a cash advantage against Trudeau. Canadian elections are low-budget affairs by American standards. Still, the Conservatives reported C$10.6 million in assets at the end of 2018, compared with C$4.7 million for Trudeau's Liberals.\n\nTrudeau's record\n\n\n\nTrudeau carries a mixed record of policy achievement into the campaign. He can tout the country's economic performance: Canada has historically low unemployment, and Liberals got a pre-campaign boost last week with some of the best monthly jobs numbers in years.\n\nOne of Trudeau's signature promises, a cash benefit for poor families, has helped drive down poverty. And a new study says Trudeau has mostly kept his promises: legalizing marijuana, allowing assisted suicide, and cutting taxes for people and businesses.\n\nTrudeau has also gotten high marks on trade. He's secured new agreements with Europe, Pacific Rim nations, and the United States. He got U.S. President Donald Trump to lift steel and aluminum tariffs. And polls have shown most Canadians support his handling of trade tensions with the U.S., and of relations with the unpredictable Trump.\n\nBut he's broken some big promises, such as failing to meet a pledge to change the electoral system. Trudeau repeatedly promised to reform Canada's elections \u2014 but it hasn't happened.\n\nAnd in the biggest blemish on his record, the SNC-Lavalin scandal, Trudeau was found to have broken a conflict-of-interest law in pressuring his former attorney general to reach an out-of-court settlement with an engineering company facing corruption charges.\n\nTrudeau repeatedly has denied wrongdoing and refused to apologize. He's said he was justified in trying to use a legal tool to help a major Canadian company that's involved in important infrastructure projects, and whose largest shareholder is a public pension fund. Scheer has called for a criminal probe.\n\nThat scandal sent Trudeau's poll numbers tumbling this year and turned what might have been an easy reelection campaign into a true horse race.", "description": "Voters decide Oct. 21 whether the Liberal prime minister will be granted a second term.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/23/d3/08ad42944af59dd39f566a4f4aa3/20190910-trudeau-looks-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
