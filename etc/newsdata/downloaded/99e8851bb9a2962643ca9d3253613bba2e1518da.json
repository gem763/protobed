Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc. was unsigned, liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor notably dissented in part and would have denied the petition, respectively.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote a powerful concurrence to the court\u2019s unsigned opinion, explaining the abortion industry\u2019s roots in the eugenics movement and how the Indiana case \u201chighlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation.\u201d\n\nThe Indiana laws, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence in 2016, were struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 2018.\n\nRegarding disposition of fetal remains, the 7th Circuit held that Indiana did not have a legitimate interest in \u201cthe \u2018humane and dignified disposal of human remains\u2019\u201d and that even if its interests were legitimate, there was not a \u201crational relationship\u201d between that interest and the law.\n\nThe Supreme Court wholly rejected that reasoning and reversed the decision.\n\nSpecifically, the 7th Circuit ruled that Indiana\u2019s interest in regulating disposal of fetal remains failed rational basis scrutiny, ignoring precedent set by the Supreme Court decades earlier in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health Inc., which recognized the legitimate government interest in mandating proper disposal of fetal remains.\n\nIn her dissent, Ginsburg asserted that the fetal remains provision must pass a higher standard of scrutiny than rational basis review (a deferential standard that simply requires a showing that a law is rationally related to legitimate government interests). But as the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion points out, the challengers did not ask the lower court to apply heightened scrutiny.\n\nBy upholding that portion of the Indiana law, fetal remains may not be classified as infectious waste as defined in Indiana Code Title 16. Health \u00a7 16-41-16-4. Put simply, the state of Indiana is well within its authority to recognize that the bodies of preborn children are human and should be treated accordingly, not disposed of with used needles, surgical products, and animal carcasses.\n\nBut the Supreme Court let stand the 7th Circuit\u2019s decision invalidating Indiana\u2019s prohibition on abortions on the basis of sex, race, and disability.\n\nThe Supreme Court expressed \u201cno view on the merits of the \u2026 question presented\u201d regarding discriminatory abortions because only one appellate court has addressed the issue so far.\n\nTypically, the high court will wait for the issue to percolate in the lower courts before granting review. Eight other states have similar laws, so it might only be a matter of time before another challenge reaches the Supreme Court.\n\nIndeed, Ohio is currently defending its prohibition on abortion on the basis of a Down syndrome diagnosis in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and similar cases are making their way through courts across the country.\n\nThomas took the opportunity to address the second provision regarding selective abortion in a concurrence, noting that such provisions \u201cpromote a State\u2019s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\u201d\n\nHe extensively documented the historical ties between Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger\u2019s birth control movement of the early 20th century and the American eugenics movement, which for a time enjoyed widespread support among academics and the political elite.\n\nThomas wrote:\n\nWhereas Sanger believed that birth control could prevent \u201cunfit\u201d people from reproducing, abortion can prevent them from being born in the first place. Many eugenicists therefore supported legalizing abortion, and abortion advocates\u2014including future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher\u2014endorsed the use of abortion for eugenic reasons. Technological advances have only heightened the eugenic potential for abortion, as abortion can now be used to eliminate children with unwanted characteristics, such as a particular sex or disability.\n\nThomas described at length the ways in which abortion has already had such an impact on society.\n\nIceland has virtually eliminated Down syndrome, because nearly 100% of children with the condition are aborted, and many other countries\u2014including the United States\u2014have staggeringly high termination rates.\n\nIn Asia, a preference for male children (in addition to programs such as China\u2019s cruel two-child policy) has led to a stark population imbalance between males and females.\n\nIn the United States, among black women, the abortion rate is almost 3.5 times that of white women. Thomas also noted that in places such as New York City, a black baby is more likely to be aborted than to be born alive.\n\nUltimately, Thomas concluded that it remains an open question whether states such as Indiana are constitutionally required to allow for eugenic abortions and wrote that the high court\u2019s \u201cdecision to allow further percolation should not be interpreted as agreement\u201d with the 7th Circuit\u2019s decision to block Indiana\u2019s attempt to prohibit discriminatory abortions.\n\nThomas warned that, should the Supreme Court at some point enshrine a right to race, sex, or disability selective abortions, it would \u201cconstitutionalize the views of the 20th-century eugenics movement.\u201d\n\nFrom admitting privileges to \u201cheartbeat\u201d bills to laws allowing for termination at any point throughout pregnancy, abortion will undoubtedly continue to loom large at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe justices may have delayed entering the fray for now, but as Thomas noted, \u201c[t]he Constitution itself is silent on abortion,\u201d and having invented the right to abortion, the court is \u201cdutybound to address its scope.\u201d", "description": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday\u00a0upheld\u00a0a provision of Indiana law that requires abortion providers to bury or cremate fetal remains, while declining to review a portion of Indiana\u2019s law\u2014struck down by a lower court\u2014that banned abortions on the basis of sex, race, and disability.", "authors": ["Melanie Israel", "Commentary By", "Research Associate", "Legal Fellow", "Appellate Advocacy Program Manager", "Meese Center For Legal", "Judicial Studies", "Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-05/GettyImages-129302327.jpg?itok=2-WWjtvh"}
