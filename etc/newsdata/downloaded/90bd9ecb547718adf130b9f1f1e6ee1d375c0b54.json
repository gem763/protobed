And having to go off-chain to solve certain limitations isn\u2019t the solution either:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t solve your decentralized reality, your decentralized dream, by centralizing it. That\u2019s philosophically incompatible.\u201d\n\n\u201cBitcoin, frankly, is the brand of cryptocurrencies\u201d\n\nHoskinson's comments on Bitcoin\u2019s importance for the entire cryptocurrency space spun out of a discussion of the merits of Proof-of-Work (PoW) vs. Proof-of-Stake systems, and which of the two is more likely to survive.\n\nHe made the case that PoW systems will only survive if they find a way to evolve in such a way that the work \u2014 computation \u2014 becomes useful, i.e. by monetizing excess computational capacity in order to establish a \u201cmarketplace for distributed computation.\u201d\n\nCurrently, he argued, those who are evangelical about the need to preserve an absolutely trustless protocol ignore the fact that PoW systems always federate in reality, being determined by who has access to subsidized power, data centers and specialized ASIC miners.\n\nNotwithstanding his vision of how the PoW space needs to evolve in order to overcome these shortcomings, he concluded with the robust acknowledgment that:\n\n\u201cBitcoin frankly is the brand of cryptocurrencies. We can\u2019t say, oh, I\u2019m going to succeed but Bitcoin\u2019ll fail. if Bitcoin fails, the whole industry\u2019s probably in for a really bad time.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Cointelegraph, Hoskinson had announced the roll-out of Cardano version 1.6 this August.", "description": "Ethereum co-founder turned Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson believes that if Bitcoin fails, the entire cryptocurrency industry could fail", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMGYwNjVhYWFmZTQzYTFlNWM5MjAzMjA4YWMxZjQzODkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
