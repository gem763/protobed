But the turmoil unnerved traders and sent S&N's share price tumbling by 8.9 per cent, or 162p, to 1667.5p, wiping \u00a31.4 billionn off the value of the business.\n\nDemand: Namal Nawana, who can earn more than \u00a36m a year, will leave the medical equipment company after just 18 months in charge,\n\nNawana's exit follows controversy over his pay and reports that the company was considering a possible relocation to the US, partly because of the country's more relaxed attitudes to the issue of executive pay.\n\nThe Australian executive joined S&N in May 2018 and earned \u00a32.2m for his first eight months, but is understood to have been dissatisfied with his package.\n\nAs pay policies were being drawn up this year, he is said to have argued his remuneration should have been in line with the lucrative packages handed to executives at rivals in the US.\n\nFor example, Nawana previously earned as much as \u00a38.6m in his old job running US diagnostics firm Alere. But at S&N he could have earned a maximum of about \u00a36.2m this year.\n\nHe had previously remarked on how he was paid 'multiples more' at Alere than what he was earning at S&N.\n\n'All I can tell you is that the British system is the British system and I joined the company because I genuinely like this opportunity,' he told the Financial Times.\n\nBut yesterday a Smith & Nephew spokesman said that in the past few weeks a 'grown-up conversation' with the board had led Nawana to decide to quit. The spokesman added: 'In the process of preparing our remuneration policy it became clear that we couldn't meet Namal's expectations on pay and reward, relative to what US devices companies pay, within corporate boundaries.'\n\nNawana arrived at S&N as it was facing demands from US hedge fund Elliott that it sell parts of the company and increase returns to shareholders. He replaced Frenchman Olivier Bohuon, who left after criticisms of poor performance.\n\nUnder Nawana, S&N has undergone a reorganisation and this year posted rising profits and upgraded its full-year revenue predictions.\n\nCHANGE AT THE TOP The departure of Namal Nawana continues a 'massacre' of FTSE 100 bosses in 2019. Nineteen blue-chip chief executives have stepped down this year, compared to the average annual turnover of 12 seen since 2000. Nawana follows out of the door RBS boss Ross McEwan, Tesco chief Dave Lewis, Standard Life Aberdeen's Martin Gilbert and BP's Bob Dudley, among a string of others. Markets analyst Neil Wilson called the exodus 'the massacre of the chief executives'. Russ Mould, of AJ Bell, added: 'The numbers have now been bolstered to the point where these departing could almost cobble together an 11-a-side football match.'\n\nThe company yesterday insisted Diggelmann, 52, was 'the right person to build on the company's success'. The former boss of Roche Diagnostics will take over on November 1.\n\nHe will be able to earn a maximum of about \u00a35.6m, a spokesman confirmed, including a salary of \u00a31.1m.\n\nWhen he takes over as chief executive, Diggelmann will continue to live in his native Switzerland, where Smith & Nephew's European headquarters is based. He will also be paid in Swiss francs.\n\nS&N's decision was cheered by campaign group the High Pay Centre, but director Luke Hildyard said: 'If a company is overly reliant on an individual executive, that reflects poorly on its long-term governance and management.'\n\nHe also added that Diggelmann's package was still 'way above the FTSE 100 average'.\n\n'With the right internal processes, Smith & Nephew would be able to secure a chief executive for less than \u00a35.5m,' he said.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: 'Nawana has only been in post for 18 months but has already helped revive the share price with a new strategy.\n\n'There appears to be a pretty simple reason he is leaving \u2013 pay.\n\n'The fear will be that this revamp of the business will be derailed by Nawana's departure, despite efforts to allay these concerns.'", "description": "Namal Nawana, who can earn more than \u00a36m a year, will leave the medical equipment company after just 18 months in charge, it was announced.", "authors": ["Matt Oliver For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
