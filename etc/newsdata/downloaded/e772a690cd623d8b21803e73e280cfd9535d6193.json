He was extremely intelligent and those who underestimated him usually discovered this to their cost.\n\nStephen Chan, a professor at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, noted Mr Mugabe had repeatedly embarrassed the West with his \"adroit diplomacy\".\n\nMugabe in his own words:\n\nGetty Images If you were my enemy, you are now my friend.

Run by a former teacher, the country had the highest literacy rates in Africa.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Money was poured into schools in the 1980s but resources were later squeezed\n\nIn her book, Dinner With Mugabe, Heidi Hollande said Mr Mugabe used to personally coach illiterate State House workers to help them pass exams.\n\nMr Mbanga recalls listening to the songs of US country singer Jim Reeves together.\n\n\"He could be very affectionate, he was an intellectual. He liked explaining things, like a teacher,\" said Mr Mbanga, but then saw a huge change in his former friend.\n\n\"He went from trying to convince you with his arguments to a man who would send his thugs to beat you up if you disagreed with him.\"\n\nIn fact, the warning signs were already there - the massacre of thousands of ethnic Ndebeles seen as supporters of Mr Mugabe's rival, Joshua Nkomo, in the 1980s and the start of the economic decline - but these were usually overlooked.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sally Mugabe was said to have been a \"moderating influence\" on her husband\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Some Zimbabweans say things started going wrong when he married his young secretary, Grace, in 1996.\n\n\"Some say he had us all fooled, I am convinced he himself changed,\" Mr Mbanga said.\n\nThe journalist says that in his early years as president, Mr Mugabe genuinely believed in trying to improve the lives of his people, and introduced a \"leadership code\" which barred ministers from owning too much property.\n\n\"Look at him today, he is fabulously wealthy. He is not the person I knew,\" Mr Mbanga said in May 2014.\n\n'Political calculator'\n\nIn February 2000, the government lost a referendum on a draft constitution.\n\nWith parliamentary elections looming four months later and a newly formed opposition party with close links to the \"No\" campaign posing a serious threat, Mr Mugabe unleashed his personal militia.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption White farmers were attacked, along with their black workers\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The land invasions turned much of Zimbabwe into no-go areas for the opposition\n\nSome were genuine veterans of the 1970s war of independence but others were far younger.\n\nTV footage of white farmers queuing up to make donations to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) meant Mr Mugabe was able to portray the opposition as stooges of the white community, and by extension the UK.\n\nThe invasion of white-owned farms achieved several goals for Mr Mugabe and his allies:\n\nPunish the white community for their \"betrayal\"\n\nRemove a source of funding from the opposition\n\nAllow the \"war veterans\" to intimidate the many thousands of black farmworkers, largely seen as opposition supporters\n\nEnsure that the opposition could not campaign in rural areas\n\nRe-energise his supporters, some of whom had been losing faith in his ability to redistribute land - one of the grievances behind the 1970s war of independence\n\nAttract new supporters with the promise of land handouts.\n\nThere was certainly a strong moral argument that land reform was needed in Zimbabwe but the way it was carried out was undoubtedly with political motivations uppermost.\n\nDespite the widespread violence, intimidation and electoral fraud, the MDC gained almost as many elected seats as Zanu-PF in 2000.\n\nHad it not been for the intimidation in rural areas, Zanu-PF may well have lost its majority.\n\nLovemore Madhuku, one of the leaders of the \"No\" campaign in 2000, described Mr Mugabe as an \"an excellent political calculator\", who adapted his tactics to the situation.\n\n\"There are moments when he chooses to be ruthless, others when he chooses to be magnanimous\u2026 He considers what is best - for him - in every situation and reacts accordingly,\" Mr Madhuku told the BBC.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mugabe: From war hero to resignation\n\nHe said Mr Mugabe might not have realised the damage the seizure of white-owned land would do to Zimbabwe's economy but in any case, he would not have cared, as long as he remained president.\n\nMr Chan agreed that, \"in terms of Mr Mugabe's value-set, the ownership of the land is more important than the smooth running of the economy\".\n\nAnd the economy continued to decline until 2008.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Zimbabwe's shops ran out of basic goods\n\nAfter 28 years of Mr Mugabe's rule, the resourceful, largely self-sufficient country lay in ruins. The inflation rate had reached an unfathomable 231 million per cent and young Zimbabweans were voting with their feet, fleeing the country he had fought to liberate.\n\nAnd yet, from this low point, he once more managed to outmanoeuvre his rivals and remain in power for another nine years.\n\n'Mummy's Boy' to African liberator\n\nThe key to understanding Robert Mugabe is the fight against white-minority rule.\n\nIn the Rhodesia where he grew up, power was reserved for some 270,000 white people at the expense of about six millions Africans.\n\nA host of other laws discriminated against the black majority, largely subsistence farmers.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Many black farmers were pushed into marginal areas of the country during the colonial era\n\nThey were forced to leave their ancestral land and pushed into the country's peripheral regions, with dry soil and low rainfall, while the most fertile areas were reserved for white farmers.\n\nReclaiming the land was one of the main drivers behind the 1970s war which brought Mr Mugabe to power.\n\nThe son of a carpenter who abandoned his family, as a child Mr Mugabe was said to have been a loner, who spent much of his time reading.\n\nMs Hollande wrote that after his elder brother died of poisoning when Mr Mugabe was just 10, his mother became depressed and the young Mugabe would do everything he could for her, to the extent he was teased as a \"mummy's boy\" at school.\n\nHe eventually qualified as a teacher and in 1958 went to work in Ghana, which had just become the first African country south of the Sahara to end colonial rule.\n\nEncouraged by his Ghanaian wife, Sally, and the pan-Africanist speeches of Ghana's leader Kwame Nkrumah, Mr Mugabe became determined to achieve the same back home.\n\nOn his return in 1960, he started to campaign for an end to discrimination and was jailed for a decade after being convicted of sedition.\n\nWhile in prison, his supporters wrested control of Zanu, the biggest party fighting white rule, and installed him as leader.\n\nOn his release, he was supposed to remain in the country but with the help of a white nun, he was smuggled over the border into Mozambique and the Zanu guerrilla camps.\n\n'He loves power'\n\nAfter Mr Mugabe won the 1980 elections which led to independence, he pursued a policy of reconciliation with the white community despite the bitterness built up during the war.\n\nIn a national address after becoming prime minister, he declared: \"If you were my enemy, you are now my friend. If you hated me, you cannot avoid the love that binds me to you and you to me.\"\n\nFour faces of Mugabe:\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nBefore independence:\n\n\"He was a very nice guy. At that stage, he was not too sure of himself. There were very strong people in Zanu who were not afraid to oppose him. He would never take a decision on his own\" - Dumiso Dabengwa\n\n1980-90:\n\n\"He did everything he could to improve the lives of his people. He wanted education for all. He wanted health for all. He introduced a leadership code limiting Zanu-PF cadres to 50 acres of land\" - Wilf Mbanga\n\n1990-2000:\n\n\"I worked very harmoniously with him and discussed issues. He would let me have my way or we would reach a compromise\" - Dumiso Dabengwa\n\n2000 - 2017:\n\n\"After 2000, he started flexing his muscles. He brought in people who he could influence. Several people were compromised - he held something over them\" - Dumiso Dabengwa.\n\n\"He has become fabulously wealthy. He is not the person I knew. He changed the moment Sally died [in 1992], when he married a young gold-digger [Grace Mugabe]\" - Wilf Mbanga\n\nHe allowed Ian Smith, the Rhodesian prime minister who had once declared that black people would not rule the country for 1,000 years and who reportedly personally refused to let Mr Mugabe leave prison for the funeral of his then only son, to remain both an MP and on his farm.\n\nAt this point, according to Mr Madhuku, Mr Mugabe's hold on power was relatively weak, so he realised he had to reach out to his former enemies.\n\nFormer home affairs minister Mr Dabengwa said Mr Mugabe was even less self-confident earlier on in his political career.\n\n\"When I first met him in the 1960s, he was not sure of himself, of his position in Zanu,\" Mr Dabengwa recalled.\n\n\"There were very strong people in Zanu who were not afraid to oppose him. He would never take a decision on his own but would always check with them first.\"\n\nBut slowly, he consolidated control - first over the party which led the war against white-minority rule and later the country as a whole - until the point where his was the only voice that counted.\n\n\"He loves power, it's in his DNA,\" said Mr Madhuku.\n\nBonds forged in war\n\nThroughout his time as president, his closest allies were always those with whom he had endured the hardships of life during the guerrilla war of independence.\n\nWhen they felt their grip on power, and its trappings, were threatened, they reverted wholeheartedly to the conflict mentality.\n\n\"We are in a war to defend our rights and the interests of our people. The British have decided to take us on through the MDC,\" he told a 2002 election rally.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fredrick Shaba was one of many MDC officials attacked around the country in elections after 2000\n\nThis meant opposition supporters were denounced as traitors - a label which could mean an immediate death sentence.\n\nMr Chimutengwende argued that the scale of the violence was exaggerated and in any case sought to distance it from Mr Mugabe: \"It is not the leader who throws a stone, or asks his followers to throw a stone.\"\n\nBut Mr Dabengwa, the minister in charge of the police in 2000, said Mr Mugabe's Zanu party had been using such methods since the 1980 election.\n\nHe said that fighters from Zanu's armed wing had been sent out into rural areas to ensure villagers voted the \"right\" way, partly through all-night indoctrination sessions, known as \"pungwes\".\n\n\"People were told there were magic binoculars which could tell which way they voted and there were no-go areas for other parties,\" said Mr Dabengwa, whose Zapu party came a distant second in 1980.\n\n\"But the British declared those elections free and fair and so Zanu learnt that that was how to win an election.\"\n\nAlthough he won those elections in 1980, and formed a coalition government with Zapu, the underlying tensions burst into open violence just two years later.\n\nZapu leader Joshua Nkomo was accused of plotting a coup and the army's North Korea-trained Fifth Brigade was sent to his home region of Matabeleland.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption After the Gukurahundi killings, Mr Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo agreed to share power\n\nMore than 20,000 people were killed in Operation Gukurahundi, which means \"the early rain which washes away the chaff\".\n\nAt the time, South African double-agent Kevin Woods was making daily reports in person to then Prime Minister Mugabe for the internal security force, the Central Intelligence Organisation.\n\n\"He obviously wanted to know exactly what Fifth Brigade was doing,\" he wrote in his autobiography.\n\nIn the end, a subdued Mr Nkomo once more agreed to share power with his enemy in order to end the violence in his home region - a forerunner of what later happened to the MDC.\n\nMugabe timeline\n\n21 February 1924: Born\n\n1964: Jailed after being convicted of sedition\n\n1973: Becomes Zanu leader\n\n1980: Becomes prime minister of Zimbabwe\n\n1987: Becomes president under new constitution agreed under deal to end Matabeleland massacres\n\n1992: Wife Sally dies\n\n1996: Marries Grace Marufu\n\n2000: Loses referendum, land invasions begin\n\n2002: Wins presidential election amid widespread violence and fraud allegations\n\n2005: Launches Operation Murambatsvina (Drive Out Rubbish), which forces 700,000 urban residents from their homes - seen as punishment for opposition supporters\n\n2008: Comes second in election, violence leads his opponent Morgan Tsvangirai to withdraw from run-off\n\n2009: Forms coalition government\n\n2013: Resoundingly re-elected, Tsvangirai returns to opposition\n\n2017: Forced to resign after army seizes power\n\n6 September 2019: Dies in Singapore, which he visits for hospital treatment\n\nBefore he was finally ousted, his political low point was in 2008, when MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat him in a presidential election, although not by enough for outright victory, according to the official results.\n\nThere were numerous reports Mr Mugabe was on the verge of resigning, although Mr Madhuku said he did not believe them, as the president subsequently demonstrated his determination to remain in power.\n\nAgain, a setback led to a sustained campaign of violence against his \"enemies\".\n\nThe army and Zanu-PF militias attacked MDC supporters around the country, killing more than 100 and forcing thousands from their homes.\n\nIt became obvious that Zanu-PF would not relinquish its grip on power and Mr Tsvangirai withdrew from the second round, saying it was the only way to save lives.\n\nZimbabwe's economy continued its freefall, reaching its nadir when people were dying from cholera in Harare because the country did not have the foreign currency to import the necessary chemicals to treat the water.\n\nUnder intense pressure, Mr Mugabe agreed to a coalition government with his long-time rival and, under MDC stewardship, the economy recovered.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Morgan Tsvangirai (r) was badly damaged by working with Robert Mugabe\n\nBut Prime Minister Tsvangirai was severely tarnished by working with Mr Mugabe - the president always managed to keep real power for himself and his allies.\n\nBy the time of the 2013 election, Mr Mugabe did not need to resort to extreme violence to win easily. He had once more demonstrated his remarkable skills of political survival and he remained in power until he was forced out in 2017.\n\nLove-hate relationship with the UK\n\nMr Mugabe justified the 2000 land invasions by saying the UK's Labour government, in power since 1997, had reneged on a British promise to fund peaceful land reform.\n\nWhile it might be expected that an avowedly Marxist liberation fighter would have more in common with the Labour Party than the Conservatives, the opposite turned out to be true.\n\nRobert Mugabe:\n\n\"Mrs Thatcher, you could trust her. But of course what happened later was a different story with the Labour Party and Blair, who you could never trust\"\n\nUnder Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the UK accepted that as the former colonial power, it had the moral duty to help finance the process of buying white-owned land and redistributing it to black farmers.\n\nBut after a report found the process had been tainted by cronyism, British funding was put on hold.\n\nThe new Labour government took matters further and declared: \"We do not accept that Britain has a special responsibility to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe.\"\n\nIn 2013, Mr Mugabe observed: \"Mrs Thatcher, you could trust her. But of course what happened later was a different story with the Labour Party and [former Prime Minister Tony] Blair, who you could never trust.\n\n\"Who can ever believe what Mr Blair says? Here we call him Bliar.\"\n\nDespite the vitriol directed at the UK from 2000 onwards, Mr Mugabe was in some ways the epitome of an English gentleman.\n\nHe was usually turned out in immaculate, dark, three-piece suits and ties - until he was given a makeover in 2000 and advised to campaign in brightly coloured cloth emblazoned with his own face, like many other African leaders.\n\nVisitors to State House were always offered tea to drink and he was a huge fan of cricket.\n\n\"Cricket civilises people and creates good gentlemen. I want everyone to play cricket in Zimbabwe; I want ours to be a nation of gentlemen,\" he once said.\n\n'Beaten Christ'\n\nHe was educated by Jesuits in the Katuma mission near his birthplace in Zvimba, north-west of Salisbury (now Harare), where he was taken under the wing of an Irish priest, Jerome O'Hea.\n\nThis is presumably where he developed his abstemious nature - he did not drink alcohol or coffee and was largely vegetarian.\n\nWilf Mbanga:\n\n\"If he had died after 10 years in power, he would have been my hero forever\"\n\nHis second wife Grace said he used to wake up at 05:00 for his exercises, including yoga.\n\nThis healthy lifestyle was no doubt one reason why he lived until the age of 95.\n\nFor many years, his health was a constant source of speculation.\n\nA 2008 US cable quoted in Wikileaks suggested Mr Mugabe had been diagnosed with cancer, giving him between three and five years to live.\n\nThis prognosis turned out to be false, and on his 88th birthday Mr Mugabe joked he had \"beaten Christ\" because he had died and been resurrected so many times.\n\n'Spoilt legacy'\n\nWhile he was vilified in the West, his anti-colonial rhetoric did strike a chord across Africa, even among many who condemned his human rights record.\n\nAt the 2013 memorial service in Soweto for Nelson Mandela - who replaced Mr Mugabe as Africa's most admired anti-colonial fighter - Zimbabwe's president was wildly cheered by the young South African crowd, even as they booed their own then leader, Jacob Zuma.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption These children in Harare had to have their lessons in the open air because there was no school building\n\n\"A lot of people think that pan-Africanism is a thing of the past but that is not true,\" said Mr Mugabe's staunch ally, Chen Chimutengwende.\n\n\"While imperialism and racism exist, pan-Africanism is still needed,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBut Zimbabwean journalist Wilf Mbanga said that in his latter years, Mr Mugabe had far more support outside his home country than within.\n\n\"Those young South Africans who praise him do not have to live under his rule,\" he said, pointing out that many Ghanaians had less than fond memories of life under pan-African hero Kwame Nkrumah, who had inspired Mr Mugabe.\n\nSo how will Mr Mugabe be remembered?\n\nMr Chan said that until 2000, Mr Mugabe had a \"good report card\", although the verdict later turned to \"disastrous\".\n\n\"If he had died after 10 years in power, he would have been my hero forever,\" said Mr Mbanga.\n\n\"But look at the schools and hospitals now.\n\n\"He has spoilt his legacy. Now, people will remember him for driving people out of Harare, Gukurahundi, election violence and everything else.\"\n\nJoseph Winter was the BBC's Zimbabwe correspondent from 1997 until he was expelled in 2001", "description": "He promised democracy and reconciliation. but hopes for the future dissolved into violence, corruption and economic misery.", "authors": ["Joseph Winter", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/128CA/production/_87287957_mugabe2007afp976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
