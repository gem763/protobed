Transport and communications are expected to be badly affected, with blackouts possible too.\n\nWorld Rugby held a press conference on Thursday to explain the impact of Typhoon Hagibis\n\nSO, WHICH GAMES ARE OFF?\n\nAs Sportsmail exclusively reported yesterday England v France will not go ahead on Saturday in Yokohama, and World Cup chiefs have also decided that New Zealand v Italy - scheduled for Saturday in Toyota is off too.\n\nAustralia v Georgia in Shizuoka, Ireland v Samoa in Fukuoka, Namibia v Canada in Kamaishi, USA v Tonga in Hanazono and Wales v Uruguay in Kumamoto should all be fine.\n\nWHAT ABOUT SCOTLAND v JAPAN?\n\nThat game is still up in the air. The intention is still to play it on Sunday in Yokohama - when it is expected that the Typhoon will have cleared the area.\n\nBut there is no predicting what damage the storm will do, so the venue will be assessed on the morning of the game and a decision taken no later than six hours before the 7.45pm (11.45am UK) kick-off.\n\nWorld Rugby have said that if the game is cancelled there are no contingency plans for it to be postponed or moved location. Scotland are clearly keen to play, even if it is behind closed doors.\n\nEngland's clash with France will no longer go ahead, nor will New Zealand's game with Italy\n\nHOW DOES THIS EFFECT THE POOLS?\n\nIf a match is cancelled in the Pool stages then tournament rules state the result will be declared 0-0, with both teams taking two points each. The cancellation of matches in Pools B and C have ended those groups prematurely.\n\nWHY IS THAT BAD NEWS FOR SCOTLAND?\n\nIf their game is off, Scotland are out of the World Cup. Japan would qualify for the knockout stages in their place having gone through unbeaten so far.\n\nItaly have already been eliminated from the tournament due to the cancellation of their game - however unlikely it was they would have beaten the All Blacks, they still had a mathematical chance.\n\nEngland and France are the least affected, as both were already through to the quarter-finals.\n\nScotland can still qualify for the quarter-finals, but only if their match goes ahead on Sunday\n\nWHY WERE THE MATCHES NOT MOVED?\n\nWorld Cup organisers said they looked \u2018extensively\u2019 at shifting the games - possibly to Oita in the southern island of Kyushu where England and Wales\u2019 quarter-finals will be, 750 miles from the capital - but the logistical challenge was too great.\n\nNot only may flights and trains not run, but there is a problem with tickets already sold. The Yokohama stadium holds 72,000 and the Oita one closer to 40,000.\n\nWILL FANS BE REFUNDED?\n\nYes. Anyone with a ticket to the cancelled games will get their money back. But World Rugby will not help them with hotel or transport costs - telling supporters to go to their travel insurers.\n\nAll fans who bought tickets to games now postponed will be given full refunds by World Rugby\n\nWHAT ADVICE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO FANS?\n\nDue to the dangerous nature of the weather everyone in Toyota, Tokyo and the affected areas have been told to stay inside over the weekend.\n\nWHAT HAVE THE TEAMS DONE?\n\nEngland have escaped Tokyo and travelled down to Miyazaki - where they had a pre-tournament camp.\n\nFrance were already down south in Kumamoto, and would have gone up to Tokyo for the match, but have switched to Oita instead - where they will meet Wales, in all likelihood, on October 20.\n\nNew Zealand and Italy are in the Toyota area and will batten down the hatches. Italy fly home on Monday.", "description": "With World Cup organisers taking the unprecedented decision to cancel two World Cup matches, Sportsmail answers the key questions on the storm that has rocked the tournament.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19545656-0-image-a-86_1570720474001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
