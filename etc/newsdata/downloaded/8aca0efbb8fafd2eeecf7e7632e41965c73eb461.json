This provided the \"normative link\" that allows the company to be held liable for the actions of its employee, even though that employee committed the robbery and murder for reasons entirely his own.\n\nSecurity supervisor Ronald Khumalo murdered financial manager Deon van Staden in November 2014 after a failed robbery at the workplace they shared in Johannesburg. Khumalo had apparently fallen behind on debt payments to loan sharks, and decided to target the petty cash box at the Bidvest subsidiary Van Staden helped to manage, and which Stallion Security guarded.\n\nTold that Van Staden did not have the keys to the safe, Khumalo made him transfer R35,000 to his account, then kidnapped Van Staden, and later shot and killed him. Khumalo was identified by way of CCTV footage and arrested. He escaped from custody, and is now presumed to be dead.\n\nVan Staden's widow sued Stallion for what she said was its vicarious liability for the loss of support from her husband, while Stallion maintained it was not responsible for Khumalo's actions.\n\nIt can be difficult to hold an employer liable for actions by an employee outside the scope of their work, the SCA said in a judgment delivered on Friday \u2013 but South African law should be developed to consider \"the creation of risk of harm by an employer\".\n\nStallion had created such a risk by among other things giving Khumalo a key that allowed him to bypass a biometric security system, the appeals court said, and so \"created a material risk\".\n\nThat the company had also made Khumalo responsible for protecting employees such as Van Staden created the link between Stallion's business and the harm suffered by his widow, it said.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:\n\n\n\n", "description": "By creating the situation where its employee could abuse his power \u2013 ultimately leading to a robbery and murder where its duty was to guard \u2013 Stallion Security made itself liable for a widow's loss, the Supreme Court of Appeal says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9415/0a421cad13b34c249f9fda305a397119.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
