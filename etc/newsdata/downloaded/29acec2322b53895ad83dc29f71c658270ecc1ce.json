Tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, it was the first instance of the motion \u2013 set out under the 2011 Fixed Term Parliaments Act \u2013 being used. Now, it is being threatened again, and has a considerably greater chance of passing, given the lack of Tory majority.\n\nTechnically, any MP can bring forward a motion of no confidence, including the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and SNP. But for it to be guaranteed a debate and vote it has to be brought by the leader of the official opposition, Mr Corbyn.\n\nBut the rules of the game shifted last week, as the prime minister told MPs in the Commons he would allow time for a confidence motion tabled by any of Westminster\u2019s parties.\n\nHe said MPs should have the \u201ccourage\u201d to table a motion, adding: \u201cThis parliament must either stand aside and let this government get Brexit done, or bring a vote of confidence and finally face a day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d\n\nIf the government loses a motion of no confidence, the act outlines a 14-day period in which an administration can be formed. The prospective government must be able to pass a confidence motion in this period.\n\nThe SNP\u2019s theory is that a caretaker prime minister will be installed in this period, and will head off to Brussels to request an Article 50 extension before calling a general election.\n\nBut it is a considerable gamble: if Westminster\u2019s political parties fail to coalesce around one figure who can command a majority in the House of Commons during this 14-day period, a general election will automatically be triggered, and British politics enters uncharted waters.", "description": "On the eve of Boris Johnson\u2019s first party conference as Tory leader, opposition parties at Westminster are threatening to ambush his government with a vote of no confidence.\u00a0 Devoid of any goodwill following the prime minister\u2019s combative language in the House of Commons and the looming Brexit deadline, MPs voted against the government last week, rejecting a request for a", "authors": ["Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/28/20/boris-conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
