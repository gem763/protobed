More and more lately, my real life and my Instagram feed show women taking fashion risks by rocking the clothing rental service\u2019s funky winter coats and floral mini dresses. It\u2019s a beautiful thing.\n\nBut when it\u2019s the same funky winter coat and the same floral mini dress that everyone else is wearing, what does that say about our actual individual senses of style?\n\nThat thought was running through my mind when I heard the news Friday that after suffering major technical difficulties, Rent the Runway was briefly halting acceptance of new subscribers and issuing a delay notice for customers who\u2019ve already subscribed (all this was detailed on its blog, The Shift).\n\nI\u2019ve used Rent the Runway for a few weddings and once for a monthlong trial period. For me, the process has historically gone off without a hitch: I\u2019ve received compliments, snapped a few photos and gone on my merry way.\n\nBut when I got home from vacation and saw two other women I know wearing the same ruffled pants I\u2019d fallen in love with, it started to feel like maybe we\u2019re all just turning into the same well-dressed person.\n\nI\u2019m prepared to take flak for saying that I think Rent the Runway has, to some extent, negatively impacted what it means to have personal style. I appreciate what it gives to users and I support anything that encourages people to dress out of their comfort zones. But perhaps a break from the service would benefit us, give us a chance to look inward and figure out exactly what we like, as opposed to what 2,094 other users have worn before us. Rent the Runway is certainly more environmentally friendly than fast fashion, but it\u2019s not more innovative in terms of nurturing our creativity and personal style.\n\nThere are customers out there who just lost a gown one day before an event, and that\u2019s shitty. There are people like my friend Jenna, who explained over Facebook Messenger on Friday that she has been frustrated with Rent the Runway\u2019s lack of communication recently, but that, as someone who travels for work events, she loves the wardrobe \u201cface-lift\u201d that being an unlimited member has afforded her over the past year.\n\nRent the Runway allows women to express themselves through fashion, and what I\u2019ve heard from many women who swear by the service is that they love having the option to try things they wouldn\u2019t normally dare to buy. By wearing that \u201cscary\u201d item, you\u2019re proving to yourself that \u201cpulling something off\u201d is a construct we\u2019ve made up in our heads and that we can actually be bolder with our fashion choices.", "description": "The clothing rental service has revolutionized our wardrobes.
