I don't know if there's anybody I don't have pictures with,' he said. 'I don't know them. I don't know about them. I don't know what they do.'\n\nA new photo emerged Monday from 2014 that shows Donald trump pictured with Rudy Giuliani's clinet, Ukrainian-born businessman Lev Parnas \u2013 who the president insisted he does not know. A report also says Parnas was at Trump's invite-only election night party in New York\n\nMike Pence, Igor Fruman, Lev Parnas, President Trump, and Rudy Giuliani are pictured in an image captured by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project\n\nWhen a reporter reminded Trump that the two men pictured were clients of Giuliani, he again distanced himself from the individuals who donated $325,000 to a Super PAC supporting him.\n\n'Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy. I just don't know,' he told journalists assembled on the South Lawn last Thursday.\n\nParnas also attended Trump's invite-only New York election night event in 2016, Politico reported \u2013 another link between the foreign-born businessman and the president.\n\nA French newspaper reported, at the time, that Parnas told a foreign correspondent at the party in Manhattan that he is a friend of the then-president-elect. He said his home in South Florida wasn't far from Trump's winter home.\n\nHe also told the paper in the recently drug up article from 2016 that a friend from his hometown of Boca Raton, Florida had hosted several fundraising events for Trump, but it is not clear what friend Parnas was referencing.\n\nParnas and Fruman worked with Giuliani to promote politically-charged investigations in Ukraine and were arrested Wednesday on federal campaign finance charges as they tried to flee the country.\n\nBorn in former Soviet republics, they assisted Giuliani with his effort to get Ukraine to investigate his theory about the 2016 elections. They also helped with Giuliani's effort to dig up dirt on a company tied to the Bidens in Ukraine.\n\nFlight risk: U.S. Judge Michael Nachmanoff ordered Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to post $1 million each in bail, surrender their passports and be subject to home detention, among other conditions, before they can be released from jail\n\nLev Parnas and Igor Fruman were arrested and charged with campaign finance crimes in an indictment unsealed Thursday\n\nThey were arrested at Dulles Airport on a plane to Vienna, Austria, a few hours after they were seen lunching with Giuliani at the Trump Hotel in Washington D.C.\n\nAt a federal court hearing in Alexandria, VA, Thursday afternoon federal prosecutors said the pair were a flight risk.\n\nU.S. Judge Michael Nachmanoff ordered Parnas and Fruman to post $1 million each in bail, surrender their passports and be subject to home detention, among other conditions, before they can be released from jail.\n\nThe two men cultivated ties with a series of top Republican officials. They had dinner with President Trump at the White House and dined with Donald Trump Jr. in 2018.\n\nParnas bragged about dining with the president at the White House that year.\n\nGiuliani said both are clients of his, and while they were sitting in Alexandria Sheriff's Office cells, the Soviet-born duo were also hit with subpoenas by the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nDining at the White House: Lev Parnas bragged that he was a guest of Donald Trump in spring 2018\n\nThe former Republican New York City mayor is facing his own legal issues, as prosecutors are now probing potential lobbying violations.\n\nIn an indictment unsealed Thursday in the Southern District of New York, the two men are accused of funneling $325,000 from a mystery Russian businessman into America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC in violation of U.S. campaign laws banning foreign donations and efforts to conceal campaign funds.\n\nIn addition to helping Trump, the same super PAC spent millions to boost former Texas GOP Rep Pete Sessions, who wrote a letter calling for the firing of former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, who Trump trashed on his infamous July call with the Ukrainian president and who House Democrats want to interview Friday as part of their impeachment probe.\n\nThe House Intelligence committee wants both men to testify about their work with Giuliani in Ukraine as part of its impeachment probe into Trump's interactions with Ukraine.\n\nTheir lawyer John Dowd - Trump's former attorney - has said they won't provide the information. Amid the standoff, three House committees issued subpoenas for interviews and information.\n\nDowd hung up on an Associated Press reporter seeking comment. He had previously replied to the Democrat-controlled committee rejecting the subpoenas and writing in comic sans font. He had also accused the Democrats of harassing his clients.\n\nThe men were arrested late Wednesday at Dulles airport in Virginia as they were about to fly abroad with one-way tickets to Vienna, according to prosecutors.\n\nU.S. President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has coffee with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, U.S. September 20, 2019. Giuliani said both Parnas and Fruman were his clients. They assisted his Ukraine investigation\n\nThis Facebook screen shot provided by The Campaign Legal Center, shows from left, Donald Trump, Jr., Tommy Hicks, Jr., Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, posted on May 21, 2018\n\nThe pair donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, through an LLC, prosecutors say.\n\nAlthough the indictment mentions only an alleged scheme to violate campaign finance laws, the two men are also connected to a the sprawling Ukraine matter that has President Trump now facing a ramped-up House Democratic impeachment effort.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the two men sought to use their connections to Giuliani to get the Ukrainian state gas company, Naftogaz, to replace members of their board of directors.\n\nThe indictment doesn't mention Giuliani, whose association with Parnas and Fruman was part of his effort to amass potential dirt on Trump political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe pair dined with Donald Trump Jr. in May 2018, along with Tommy Hicks Jr., according to a Facebook post that captured the event. Hicks was leading the pro-Trump super PAC at the time and now has a position as co-chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\nThey also had dinner with President Trump, and images Parnas posted on Twitter in May thanks the president for an 'incredible dinner and even better conversation' at the White House.\n\nHe also wrote: '!!!! Making America Great!!!!!!!' and tagged '#TRUMP2020.'\n\nAn image posted by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project shows them pictured with Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, and Giuliani.\n\nChief rabbi of Ukraine Moshe Reuven Azman with former Arkansas governor Mike Hackabee - father of Sarah Huckabee Sanders - and 'American friends of Anatevka' Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were pictured in Jerusalem\n\nDavid Correia, President Trump, and Igor Fruman on July 4, 2018\n\nThey also donated to Florida Sen. Rick Scott and hosted fundraisers for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis headlined by Donald Trump Jr., the Miami Herald reported.\n\nThe men are being represented John Dowd, who served as Donald Trump's lawyer during part of the Mueller probe.\n\nTheir company, Global Energy Producers LLC, has been accused of violating campaign finance laws for its six-figure donations to the super PAC.\n\nU.S. election law prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions to U.S. political campaigns, as well as efforts to shield the origins of campaign donations.\n\nThose laws are in part to protect U.S. elections from 'illegal foreign financial influence,' according to the indictment unsealed Thursday.\n\nSaid U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman at a press conference in New York: 'Protecting the integrity of our elections and protecting our elections from unlawful fore influence are core functions of our Campaign finance laws. And as this office has made clear, we will not hesitate to investigate and prosecute those who engage in criminal conduct that draws into question the integrity of our political process.'\n\nBerman added: 'And I want to add that this investigation is continuing.'\n\nThe men 'conspired to circumvent the federal laws against foreign influence by engaging in a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and State office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates' governments,' according to the indictment.\n\nUS Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman announced that the FBI arrested Parnas and Fruman at Dulles International airport in Virginia\n\nDeja vu: The two Soviet-born Americans have hired Kevin Downing as an attorney. He previously represented Paul Manafort who is now serving seven and a half years in prison and facing another trial in New York under state law\n\nThe indictment says they concealed the effort from the campaigns themselves, and laundered the contributions through LLCs and through the use of 'straw contributors.'\n\nParnas was born in Ukraine and Fruman was born in Belarus.\n\nAlthough the indictment doesn't mention Trump or the pro-Trump super PAC by name, it says: 'Specifically, in or about May 2018, to obtain access to exclusive political events and gain influence with politicians, LEV PARNAS and IGOR FRUMAN, the defendants, made a $325,000 contribution. to an independent expenditure committee (Committee-1) and a $15,000 contribution to a second independent expenditure committee Despite the fact that the FEC forms for these contributions required PARNAS and FRUMAN to disclose the true donor of the funds, they falsely reported that the contributions came from GEP, a purported liquefied natural gas import export business that was incorporated by FRUMAN and PARNAS around the time the contributions were made.'\n\nBut in truth and fact, the funds came 'from a private lending transaction between FRUMAN and third parties, and never passed through a GEP account,' it says. They took the actions 'deliberately' in order to evade reporting requirements, according to the indictment.\n\nAlso indicted are David Correia, who is described as a businessman born in the U.S., and Andrey Kukushkin, a businessman and U.S. citizen who was born in Ukraine.\n\nKukushkin was arrested in San Francisco, and Correia is not yet in custody, prosecutors said.\n\nGiuliani said he couldn't comment at this point when contacted by a Buzzfeed reporter.\n\nParnas told BuzzFeed he met with President Trump 'many times.' He was working in 2018 to help introduce Giuliani to Ukrainians as he explored his unproven theory that Ukraine carried out election interference by pushing out information on now-jailed Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. Among his efforts was putting together a Skype call between Giuliani and Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor whose firing Vice President Joe Biden demanded in 2016, according to the publication.\n\nPrimer on Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman arrested on campaign finance charges - The two Florida businessmen were arrested at Dulles airport Wednesday evening after buying one-way tickets - They are charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and breaking campaign finance laws - Parnas hails from Ukraine; Fruman is from Belarus - They have retained Donald Trump lawyer John Dowd and were represented in federal court Thursday by Paul Manafort lawyer Kevin Downing - Both assisted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in his effort to dig up dirt on the Bidens and pursue his theory of Ukrainian-Democratic \u2013 rather than Russian \u2013 'collusion' - Their lawyer John Downd says they did work for Giuliani but Giuliani also provided legal representation to them - They donated $325,000 to pro-Trump super PAC called America First Action through Global Energy Producers LLC, a natural gas company - Also gave $15,000 to another independent expenditure committee - The money actually came from a 'private lending transaction,' according to prosecutors - They also gave contributions as part of an effort to court politicians to get a multi-state license for a marijuana business - Prosecutors allege $1 million was actually from a Russian businessman - The pro-Trump PAC spent $3 million to help embattled Rep.

Sessions, the former chair of the House Rules Committee, who was in a tough reelection fight, along with David Correia, who was also charged in the indictment.\n\nJust two days later, Sessions wrote Secretary of Mike Pompeo, telling the nation's top diplomat: 'I have received notice from close companions that Ambassador Yovanovitch has spoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration,' the Daily Beast reported. Days later, Global Energy Producers made its donation to the America First PAC.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Parnas and Frumon agreed in May and June 2018 to raise $20,000 or more for a 'then-sitting congressman' identified only as 'Congressman-1' who had been the beneficiary of $3 million in independent expenditures by the PAC.\n\nThey also sought the lawmaker's assistance to 'remove and recall' the then-U.S. ambassador.\n\nThe indictment says Fruman made an individual $2,700 maximum campaign contribution, then did another in Parnas' name. It also identifies a not-stealthy effort to 'conceal' contributions by putting his name as 'Furman' rather than the correct spelling.\n\nThe overall scheme was designed to allow the conspirators to 'gain influence with candidates,' the government charged.\n\nThey made contributions in their own name instead of in the name of 'Foreign National-1.'\n\nThe took steps to hide the person's involvement due to what Kukushkin called the person's 'Russian roots and current political paranoia about it.'\n\nThey also planned to use his funds to make contributions to state and federal officials in an effort to obtain a license for their recreational marijuana business. To fund their efforts to 'gain influence' and the 'appearance of influence' with politicians, the unnamed foreign national arranged for two separate $500,000 wire transfers to an account controlled by Fruman.\n\nThey attended a campaign rally with 'Candidate-1' in Nevada on October 20, 2018, the same day Trump held a rally in Elko, Nevada.\n\nThat was a rally where Trump campaigned for Rep. Mark Amodei.\n\nHomestate Republican Senator Dean Heller said at the event in Nevada's gold country: 'Mr. President, you know a little bit about gold. In fact, I think that everything you touch turns to gold.'\n\nOff stage, Trump told traveling reporters the U.S. would be pulling out of the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty with the former Soviet Union.\n\nOn Nov. 1, a $10,000 contribution went to the candidate in Fruman's name, but it was actually funded by the foreign national, according to the indictment.\n\nThree House committees on Thursday subpoenaed Parnas and Fruman, who had not complied with an earlier request for documents.\n\n'Your clients are private citizens who are not employees of the Executive Branch. They may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry,' the chairmen wrote their attorney, John Dowd.\n\n'They are required by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas. They are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance, and obstruction.'\n\nDowd had responded to the initial request by saying the two men by saying they 'assisted' Giuliani in his representation of President Trump. But he also wrote that Parnas and Fruman 'have also been represented' by Giuliani, making the case that attorney-client privilege could come into play.", "description": "Trump said he isn't familiar with two businessmen who were arrested last week in connection to the Ukraine scandal, but it was revealed Monday that he met one of them before he began campaigning.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com", "Francesca Chambers"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/23/19714200-0-image-a-3_1571092413144.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
