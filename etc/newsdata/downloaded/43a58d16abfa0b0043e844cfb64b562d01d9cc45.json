After sending a racist tweet, for instance, in which he urged the four Democratic congresswomen \u2014 known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2014 to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, Trump described them in another message as \u201ca very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.\u201d And after Trump described the majority-black district of Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is also black and chairs the House Oversight Committee, as a \u201crat and rodent infested mess,\u201d the president twice accused his Democratic critics of playing \u201cthe race card\u201d and called Cummings \u201cracist\u201d in a tweet\u2026\n\nGoing back a bit further, Trump has frequently cast doubt on the assessment of his own intelligence community\u2019s findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential elections with the goal of helping elect him president. But now, he is turning the charge back on his political foes, espousing an unfounded conspiracy theory that a foreign government did interfere in the 2016 contest \u2014 but that it was Ukraine, with the goal of helping Democrats.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ashley Parker", "Washingtonpost.Com Politics The-Im-Rubber-Youre-Glue-Presidency-Trump-Turns-To-Schoolyard-Taunts-In-Impeachment-Battle"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
