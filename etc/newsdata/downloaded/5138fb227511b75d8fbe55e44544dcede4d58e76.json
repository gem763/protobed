Here's What to Know", "language": "en", "text": "Princes Charles, Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and Brazilian leader Jair Bolsonaro are all in Tokyo this week, as foreign figureheads and royals from across the globe flock to Japan to watch Emperor Naruhito formally declare his enthronement on Tuesday.\n\nThe former Crown Prince took over the role on May 1, the day after his father, 85-year-old former-Emperor Akihito, abdicated the throne citing health concerns. Japan\u2019s monarchs are expected to serve until death, but parliament passed special legislation to allow Akihito to step down. He was the first emperor to step down in more than 200 years.\n\nAlthough Emperor Naruhito has been acting as emperor for almost six months, his ascension is not official until he completes a series of rituals, including Tuesday\u2019s traditional enthronement ceremony.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about this week\u2019s celebrations.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening on Tuesday?\n\nThe main event will be held at Tokyo\u2019s Imperial Palace on Tuesday when the Emperor will ascend the Takamikura throne, which stands more than 20 feet high. Clad in a dark orange robe, worn by emperors only on special occasions, Naruhito will declare his enthronement in a short speech, according to the Japan Times. Empress Masako, his wife, will be seated in an adjacent throne.\n\nImportant imperial regalia, like an ancient sword and a jewel will be brought to the ceremony.\n\nFollowing the Emperor\u2019s speech, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will offer congratulations, and lead guests in three cheers wishing longevity to the new emperor.\n\nApproximately 2,000 people are expected to join the ceremony. Guests including King Philippe of Belgium, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain, and Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan are expected to attend, reports the Japan Times.\n\nA royal parade \u2014 in which the Emperor and Empress will drive through the streets of Tokyo in a convertible \u2014 has been postponed until November due to Typhoon Hagibis, which hit Japan this month. More than 70 people were killed by the storm and its aftermath, according to Reuters.\n\nThe government announced on Friday that more than half a million petty criminals will be pardoned in honor of the enthronement. The Justice Ministry said the pardons will be granted because the occasion marks \u201can opportunity for the citizens of Japan to cleanse their spirit and start anew,\u201d reports the Times.\n\nThis Tuesday is a public holiday in Japan.\n\nWho is the new emperor?\n\nK\u014dtaishi Naruhito Shinn\u014d was born February 23, 1960. He is the oldest son of the former Emperor Akihito.\n\nEmperor Naruhito grew up in Tokyo\u2019s Imperial Palace with this siblings and parents.\n\nHe is the first Japanese royal to study overseas. After earning a history degree at Gakushuin University, where he wrote a thesis on medieval water transport, he spent two years at Merton College, Oxford. The book he wrote chronicling his time there, The Thames and I: A Memoir of Two Years at Oxford, was re-issued in English this year.\n\nPrince Naruhito\u2019s hobbies include mountain climbing, jogging, tennis, skiing and playing the viola, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWhat role do Japan\u2019s monarchs play?\n\nJapan is believed to have the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world.\n\nHistorically, the emperor was viewed as an almost divine being, believed to be descended from the Shinto deity Amaterasu, but the emperor\u2019s role became largely symbolic after World War II. The country\u2019s post-war constitution, primarily U.S. drafted, stripped Japan\u2019s emperor of real political power and re-defined his role as a \u201csymbol of the state and of the unity of the people.\u201d\n\nToday, the Japanese emperor has become a ceremonial and unifying figure, similar to monarchs in the United Kingdom, Norway and Spain.\n\nThe emperor is an important symbol for Japanese people. \u201cThe emperor is the means by which the Japanese define the national identity, what it means to be Japanese,\u201d Ken Ruoff, professor of history and director of the Center for Japanese Studies at Portland State University tells TIME.\n\nRuoff says \u201cEach emperor puts his stamp on his particular reign, and Naruhito will do that.\u201d\n\nRead More: Five Things to Know About the Modern Japanese Monarchy\n\nFamily affairs\n\nNaruhito\u2019s wife is a Harvard and Oxford-educated former diplomat named Masako Owada.
