I'm Drew and THIS IS MY FACE.\n\n\n\nIf this GIF has ever brought you joy in the past, I humbly ask you to consider making a donation to the National MS Society. It would mean a lot to me and to those I know affected by the disease!\n\n\n\nDonate at https://t.co/vf6ItTacgR pic.twitter.com/VaFbgOKrV2 \u2014 Drew Scanlon (@drewscanlon) September 19, 2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never used the meme before because I felt like I didn\u2019t own it,\u201d Scanlon said Sunday after he finished a 120-mile bike ride fundraiser for multiple sclerosis. \u201cThe Internet made it and found this funny way to use it.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019d always thought it would be \u201cnot cool\u201d for him to use the GIF, like a guy in a band wearing his own band T-shirt. He also said it got so big on social media, it was \u201ca little scary.\u201d\n\nBut he changed his mind last week as he was gearing up for the two-day ride in support of two close friends who have MS, one recently diagnosed. During the ride through Northern California, Scanlon, who lives in San Francisco, updated his status when he took breaks, encouraging people to donate.\n\nPeople responded with an outpouring of support, with many saying they were gobsmacked that Scanlon, whose profile picture doesn\u2019t mirror the wide-eyed, fresh-faced man in the GIF, was the Blinking Guy. One person wrote, \u201cThis is the best use of fame I\u2019ve seen in awhile,\u201d and others responded to Scanlon\u2019s announcement with \u2014 wait for it \u2014 his own GIF.\n\nScanlon ended up raising about $25,000. Last year, he did the same ride and raised about $7,000, he said.\n\nThis woman has MS. Her friends have kept their promise to visit her every weekday \u2014 for 21 years and counting\n\nThe GIF comes from a moment in 2013 when Scanlon was working for the gaming website Giant Bomb, and he and co-workers were streaming themselves on the Internet as they watched and played a video game. A friend of Scanlon\u2019s made a bad joke, and Scanlon reacted with his now-famous blink. Someone made it into a meme and sent it to Scanlon at the time, but he laughed it off and forgot about it.\n\nIt popped up sometimes over the next couple years, but in 2017 it suddenly was everywhere. Celebrities like Stephen Colbert and filmmaker Ava DuVernay used it, and Scanlon realized it had reached a tipping point when a friend told him that the friend\u2019s mother has used it on Facebook.\n\nNow, he said, sometimes when people first meet him and find out he\u2019s that guy, they\u2019ll ask him to blink.\n\n\u201cI feel like I can never do it correctly because it\u2019s not natural for me to try to re-create that moment,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nHe said the fundraiser is the best thing to come from his prolonged and bizarre Internet celebrity. He did the bike ride with his friend, Katie Bernstein, 36, who was recently diagnosed with MS. Bernstein\u2019s mother has had the disease for decades, she said. Bernstein said she\u2019s grateful for Scanlon\u2019s friendship, and also his notoriety.\n\n\u201cIt feels really special to me that when my friend decided to step out into the world with \u2018That\u2019s me, that\u2019s my face,\u2019 he could have done it for personal gain,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cBut he did it for me and MS.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nComedians are being hired by the hour to help dementia patients.
