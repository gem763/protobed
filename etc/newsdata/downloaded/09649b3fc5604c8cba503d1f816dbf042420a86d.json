Ireland rarely looked like claiming the victory that would have booked their place at next summer\u2019s finals.\n\n\u201cWell, we were beaten by the better team, considerably the better team actually,\u201d said Mick McCarthy, the Ireland manager, who added he would have taken the scenario of having to defeat Denmark to reach the finals before kick-off. \u201cIn the first half we didn\u2019t play particularly well. Whatever system we play it does not excuse our wayward passing and the stuff that we did.\u201d\n\nEven a first start for the teenager Aaron Connolly did not provide the spark required as McCarthy tinkered with his system and personnel in a vain battle to gain a foothold. The pitch, which had passed an inspection two hours before kick-off after torrential rain throughout the day, proved sticky and the Swiss made the better start, with Granit Xhaka forcing an early save from Randolph after taking aim from distance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Haris Seferovic scoring Switzerland\u2019s opening goal with a low drive. Photograph: Jean-christophe Bott/AP\n\nIreland\u2019s efforts to work their way into the game often stalled as they wasted possession and they were made to pay when Seferovic latched on to a half-clearance, took a touch and then fired home across Randolph and inside the far post.\n\nIreland were penned deep inside their own half and seemingly incapable of picking out a teammate on the rare occasions they did have the ball. They finally started to make a limited impression but almost conceded again eight minutes before the break.
