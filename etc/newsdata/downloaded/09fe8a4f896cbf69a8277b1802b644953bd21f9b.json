As vice president, Biden condemned Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\nLike other Democratic candidates, Biden has denounced Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Biden has said he would pursue an extension of the New START nuclear arms control treaty with Russia, which expires in 2021 and which Trump has not committed to extending.\n\nOn trade, Biden has indicated he would lift some tariffs that are damaging to U.S. farmers, but said he also would prevent China from stealing intellectual property and \u201cdumping steel on us.\u201d\n\nBiden, who served as Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years, has argued he has the foreign policy experience that none of the other Democratic candidates possess. Obama trusted Biden with withdrawing troops from Iraq and uniting allies to combat Islamist terrorism, Biden said in his NPR interview.\n\nBut his long record also opens Biden up to criticism. He voted in 2002 to authorize the use of military force against Iraq, paving the way for President George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion that led to a long and costly conflict and destabilized the Middle East.\n\nBiden later called his vote a mistake and has promised to end America\u2019s \u201cforever wars.\u201d In a Democratic debate in Houston this month, he said he would withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan and suggested using bases in Pakistan to \u201cprevent the United States being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nThe U.S. senator from Vermont has combined his calls for a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d at home with a vision for a shift in U.S. policy overseas. Sanders has criticized high levels of military spending that enrich defense contractors and pledged to cool tensions with Iran.\n\nSanders said in this month\u2019s debate that he and Biden strongly disagree on trade, citing his opposition to trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement that Sanders said led to job losses.\n\nIn the past, Sanders expressed solidarity with left-wing governments, but now draws a distinction between his avowed \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d and governments like that of Venezuela\u2019s Nicolas Maduro, who he has called a \u201cvicious tyrant.\u201d\n\nAs well as opposing Cold War-era policies, he voted against the Iraq war and co-authored a bipartisan resolution to try to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabia-led war against Houthi insurgents in Yemen.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nThe U.S. senator from Massachusetts has pledged to create a foreign policy with a focus on creating and defending jobs in the United States. Warren has said she would cut the \u201cbloated defense budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to bring our troops home\u201d from Afghanistan, Warren said in a Democratic debate, \u201cand then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.\u201d\n\nWarren was the first major candidate to call for Trump to be impeached for taking actions to impede the federal investigations of Russian election interference. She also criticized the president\u2019s June meeting with Putin in which Trump appeared to make light of the election interference.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG\n\nButtigieg studied abroad in England and Tunisia and worked for the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. He took time out of his first term as mayor of South Bend, Indiana to deploy to Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve.\n\nButtigieg has pledged to reverse two pivotal steps taken by Trump by having the United States rejoin the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accord. Buttigieg has argued for scrapping the authorization for use of military force passed by Congress in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, saying it has become a \u201cblank check\u201d for the use of force.\n\n\u201cWhen America acts alone, it can only be because core interests are at stake and because there is no alternative,\u201d said Buttigieg, adding that neither the situation in Venezuela nor that in Iran passed that test. He also has said he would withhold U.S. funds from Israel if it annexes West Bank settlements.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS\n\nThe U.S. senator from California has not issued a detailed foreign policy plan, but has emphasized restoring America\u2019s traditional alliances like NATO. She has said trade policy should help the United States \u201cexport American products, not American jobs,\u201d but added the nation needs to trade with the world and should partner with China on climate change issues and North Korea. \u201cI am not a protectionist Democrat,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHarris has been criticized by some on the left for her links to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israeli lobbying group. Her website describes her support for Israel as \u201cunshakeable\u201d and that she would \u201cwork towards a two-state solution so that Palestinians and Israelis can govern themselves in security, dignity and peace.\u201d\n\nANDREW YANG\n\nAlong with his flagship domestic proposal for a universal basic income for all Americans over age 18, Yang has proposed a \u201creverse boot camp\u201d to ensure military service members are ready to return to civilian life. The former tech entrepreneur\u2019s foreign policy initiatives include a proposal to develop new encryption standards that are not vulnerable to quantum computing technology, as well as to invest in quantum technology to stay ahead of geopolitical rivals.\n\nYang also has said the decision to launch a nuclear attack should not rest solely with the president, proposing that the vice president also verify such calls.\n\nCORY BOOKER\n\nThe U.S. senator from New Jersey has criticized Trump\u2019s foreign policy as an \u201cAmerica alone policy\u201d and emphasized working with allies to take on the challenges of China and climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose,\u201d Booker said in a debate. \u201cThat\u2019s how we beat China.\u201d\n\nBooker has said it was a mistake for Trump to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal but that he would take the opportunity to renegotiate the agreement.\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE\n\nThe former U.S. congressman from Texas has said he would end Trump\u2019s trade war on day one of his administration and suspend tariffs, a commitment none of the other top 10 Democratic candidates have made. O\u2019Rourke has proposed leading a global coalition to pressure China to end anti-competitive behavior.\n\nJULIAN CASTRO\n\nThe former U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development said in a debate he would put a renewed focus on Latin America to address immigration and to compete with China\u2019s growing influence there.\n\nHe said a \u201c21st Century Marshall Plan for Central America,\u201d like the post-World War Two initiative to rebuild Western Europe, is needed \u201cso that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the One Iowa and GLAAD LGBTQ Presidential Forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Scott Morgan/File Photo\n\nThe United States should also pressure Venezuela to have free and fair elections and offer those fleeing the country temporary protected status, Castro said.\n\nTULSI GABBARD\n\nThe U.S. congresswoman from Hawaii has made her anti-war position central to her campaign. Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran, has spoken against U.S. involvement in Syria\u2019s civil war as part of a personal campaign to end \u201cregime change wars.\u201d She has met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and expressed skepticism that his government was behind chemical weapons attacks, drawing fierce criticism from some in her own party.", "description": "President Donald Trump's unpredictable foreign policy moves have sent shock waves around the world, from his overhaul of U.S. trade relationships to his questioning of longstanding alliances.", "authors": ["Simon Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433288185&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0P6", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
