And more than half said they set their thermostat to 68 degrees or lower in the winter to reduce power consumption by their heaters.\n\nBut only 45 percent of respondents said they often or always set the air conditioner at 76 degrees or higher in the summer to do the same. Close to a third of Americans said they hardly ever or never set their thermostat that high.\n\nLess than a fifth of Americans said they often or always use public transportation, carpool, bike or walk instead of driving, according to the poll. More than half said they hardly ever do so, and some 44 percent said they rarely eat vegetarian meals.\n\nWhether survey participants believed in climate change plays a significant role in their decisions, the poll found, and previous research shows money is an influence, too. Even people who don\u2019t acknowledge climate change will regularly turn off unnecessary lights and turn down the heat or air conditioning to lower their bills.\n\nBut even those who believe climate change is real and their actions can make a difference are only slightly more likely to make greener choices, the AP reported.\n\nIn some rural areas, people can\u2019t just hop on a bus or train like city dwellers. The poll found that urban residents were twice as likely to frequently use non-driving options as people in suburban and rural areas.\n\nIowa resident Jon Dahlstrom told the AP that he\u2019ll dim lights and adjust his thermostat, but there are limits to what he alone can accomplish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m out in the middle of Iowa, so there is no public transportation,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "An AP-NORC Center poll found that environmentally-friendly choices aren't all popular.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/08/0/0/coal-fired-power-plant.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
