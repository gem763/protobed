Much of the GDP losses will come from a decline of business confidence and negative market reactions, she said.\n\n\"In 2019, we expect slower growth in nearly 90 percent of the world. The global economy is now in a synchronized slowdown. This means that growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade,\" Georgieva said.\n\nThe Bulgarian economist, a former European Union official who previously held the number two job at the World Bank Group, said that trade had \"come to a near standstill.\"\n\nShe warned that fractures in trade could lead to changes that last a generation, including \"broken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a 'digital Berlin Wall' that forces countries to choose between technology systems.'\"\n\nIn calling for countries to work together to revise global trade rules to make them sustainable, she referenced frequent complaints about China's trade practices, without specifically naming the country.\n\n\"That means dealing with subsidies, as well as intellectual property rights and technology transfers,\" she said, adding that a modernized trading system would unlock the potential of services and e-commerce.", "description": "IMF research suggests the cumulative effect of trade conflicts could mean a $700 billion reduction in global GDP output by 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106170216-1570545937874gettyimages-1174489296.jpeg?v=1570545971", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
