Bloomberg\n\nAccording to one film industry insider, when presented with the initial script, scribbled on the back of an envelope by the hot Hollywood script-writing duo Frydenberg & Cormann, Lowe expressed confusion about the specifics of the plot, reportedly saying: \u201cWhy am I using cash to buy a banana? My wife has them delivered every Friday morning from Vaucluse Gourmet Grocers. That\u2019s the only place you can get those yummy little hand-picked ones specially flown in from Thailand.\u201d\n\nIn order to prepare for the challenging role of the \u201ctypical Aussie self-funded retiree\u201d, and employing the Stanislavski \u201cmethod\u201d approach to acting, Lowe spent several months \u201cgetting into character\u201d. During the initial stage of his preparations. Lowe\u2019s acting coach asked him to pretend that it was the late 1990s during the Howard years and that he was an ordinary bloke in his 40s with an ordinary job, but who spent his evenings fantasising with his wife about how they would spend their retirement \u201ctwilight\u201d years.", "description": "The Oscar talk has started early with RBA governor Philip Lowe's searing portrayal of a self-funded retiree using cash to buy fruit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.373%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_433%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/86e38b8ff8d8ed0d53f678a17af874e9ee59d0b4", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
