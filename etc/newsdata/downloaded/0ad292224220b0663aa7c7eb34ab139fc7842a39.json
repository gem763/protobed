There was even a reference in his speech in Perth yesterday to Australia's deadly enemy of complacency. There was nothing at all about the plutocrats at the \u201cthe big end of town\u201d or their \u201cunfairness\u201d.\n\nThis is different language from Labor, recognising that wealth in wages, taxes, and profit has to be earned first with investment and productivity. \u201cEconomic success is not inevitable,\u201d Mr Albanese says. His predecessor Bill Shorten thought that it was, to the extent that he made the May election into a \u201creferendum on wages\u201d so that people could vote themselves higher wages through new mandatory wage floors and industry pattern bargaining. He promptly lost an election that most people had expected him to win. Sceptical workers did not buy the over-complex redistribution agenda, or the class war message it came wrapped up in.\n\nLeader of the Opposition Anthony Albanese at a CEDA discussion in Perth yesterday. AAP\n\nBut Prime Minister Scott Morrison needs to be careful too. Mr Albanese is now selling some of the same aspirational messages that the PM has just won the election with. And Mr Morrison knows something about the effectiveness of political cross-dressing. He partly neutralised Mr Shorten\u2019s populist business-bashing through his own big stick policies towards the banks and energy companies that will be just as counter-productive as in Labor\u2019s hands.\n\nMr Albanese focused on climate and energy policy that causes neuralgia for the Coalition and turned it into a positive story about using Australia\u2019s advantages in gas and lithium to create new hydrogen and battery exports. In a speech in Perth back in June, Mr Morrison began to set out an economic growth agenda based on the incentive power of tax cuts, removal of red tape, a national skills effort, and industrial relations. But he must now take this forward. He cannot rule by ruling out, as his predecessors did on tax reform. Out of Labor\u2019s May disaster, the Coalition may have to compete for aspirational votes again. Are they up for it?", "description": "The Labor leader is speaking a different language from Bill Shorten.
