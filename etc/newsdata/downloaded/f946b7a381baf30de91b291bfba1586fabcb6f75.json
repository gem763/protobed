Credit: Getty Images\n\nWe're barely knee-deep in summer's waters, but we're already trend talking about Autumn/Winter makeup looks with Raine Tauber.\n\nAfrican Fashion International (AFI) Fashion Week kicked off today 10 October, at the Sandton Convention Centre with over 30 designers showcasing their Autumn/Winter 2020 collections.\n\nAnd we all know that it is impossible not to marry new design collections with trendy and seasonal makeup looks too, so in preparation for AFI, Avon \u2013 the makeup sponsor for LMDA Beauty Ateliers at AFI 2019 \u2013 spoke with Director Raine Tauber about the makeup looks guests can expect to see on the runway.\n\nREAD MORE: The minimalist and ethical beauty kit: here's everything you need to know according to the makeup artist who's worked with Beyonc\u00e9, Naomi Campbell and Kim K\n\nThis is what Raine shared with us:\n\nIt\u2019s not always about dewy and glowing skin\n\nWhen it comes to Autumn/Winter makeup, we\u2019re expecting natural looks that don\u2019t focus too much on the glow of one\u2019s face. During AFI, we\u2019ll be using matte textures more strategically to ensure there is no unwanted shine. Expect to see an element of the rawness where imperfections are allowed to shine through. This means using foundation sparingly or dabs of concealer to cover up here and there.\n\nPops of electric colours are generally runway favorites\n\nThese pops can occur on both the lips and cheeks for a diffused look. There is going to be a romantic approach to colour with pops of peach and pinks, washed over with a nude, however, the classic red lip will still make a statement on the AFI stage. There will also be an influence of the orange hues into the red for a softer red lip.\n\nHer picks: Avon Power Stay 16-hour Lip Color in Persistent Pink Sidebar - I've tried it and I too, would recommend it.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the liner\n\nBlack is present in every season, usually in the form of the liner. That is still the case this season but the liner will be straighter and bigger than usual. We\u2019ll also be incorporating mascara into the liner this week to give off that messy, grungy look around the eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompiled by Afika Jadezweni\n\nSign up to W24\u2019s newsletters so you don't miss out on any of our hot stories and giveaways.", "description": "We're barely knee-deep in summer's waters, but we're already trend talking about Autumn/Winter makeup looks with Raine Tauber.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9462/7915a2df77894bd08d1ee93e3845f866.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
