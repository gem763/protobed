His manager and trainer were on their way to him at a trot. The people at Nationals Park were angry, except maybe for that right-field section highest and farthest from home plate, a drop of orange in a cranberry bog.\n\nIn the first-ever World Series game in this ballpark, the first in this town in 86 years, Zimmerman, the original Nat, was late on Friday night cheek-deep in batter\u2019s box dust, the result of a 98-mph fastball that had he lost sight of, he\u2019d certainly heard.\n\nThe catcher, a cheery Venezuelan named Robinson Chirinos, looked over to Zimmerman and said, \u201cYou all right?\u201d Zimmerman did not move, did not look up, merely said, \u201cMan, that was a close one.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Houston Astros and Washington Nationals were, it turned out, three pitches into the eight-pitch at-bat that might have, could have, probably did, decide Game 3. They had arrived in the second half of the fifth inning, the Astros ahead by two runs, the Nationals ahead by two games. The Nationals had runners at second and third bases.\n\nStory continues\n\nZimmerman already had singled and walked in two plate appearances. Josh James, the 26-year-old reliever in his first full big-league season, had replaced Zack Greinke those three pitches earlier. The ballpark stirred, sensing the Astros were in trouble, this being the general reaction by Nationals fans and anything to do with bullpens. Also, a three-games-to-none lead with the next two games scheduled for this corner would likely have had the mayor drawing parade routes. So this was it, their guy Zim taking the first two pitches from James, both of them strikes, then getting a hissing fastball that missed his chin by a baby shark\u2019s breath. He twisted and flung himself away, landed in the dirt and just figured he\u2019d stay there a bit, count his limbs, think about the good days and happier times.\n\n\u201cThat one just got away,\u201d James said.\n\nThe Astros needed a baseball game, all things considered. They needed to invite people into a baseball park, any baseball park, any town, didn\u2019t matter which, turn on the lights and play a baseball game.\n\nThe Washington Nationals returned home on Friday and lost Game 3 of the World Series to the Houston Astros. (AP/Patrick Semansky)\n\nThey\u2019d had themselves quite a disaster, far as weeks go, what with the subpar baseball and the \u2014 let\u2019s call it \u2014 other stuff, stuff that did not reflect on their baseball exactly, but that certainly soiled everything above and around the baseball. They\u2019d won the American League pennant and then proceeded to throw up all over themselves for the next six days, and wore that around for a while.\n\nSo, yeah, some actual baseball. Maybe even some good baseball, were they able to get back to their usual game.\n\nBeyond that, the Astros needed to win a baseball game, win the little moments in the shadowy corners that once got them to 107 wins and all the way to a World Series they\u2019d be favored to win, if not for, you know, that week. The week in which they played uneven, even occasionally terrible, baseball. The week that was so terrible in other ways maybe some folks didn\u2019t even notice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re too talented,\u201d their shortstop, Carlos Correa, said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come too far.\u201d\n\nThey got on a plane for D.C. They took a breath. They gave the baseball to Zack Greinke, who on Friday night was given to long, soulful walks of self-evaluation. Who did not walk to the top of the mound between pitches, but scaled its southern face. He worked slow and walked slower and lasted for 95 pitches and 14 outs, at which point the Astros led, 3-1, and James headed in from left field with the potential tying runs in scoring position and everyone\u2019s hero at the plate. He came with a fastball, a slider and a changeup, maybe none any better than the rest, all of them quite capable.\n\nNot, at 35, the offensive threat he once was, Zimmerman nevertheless had four hits in 10 at-bats in the series until then, and had hit a respectable .290 in the nine postseason games leading to the World Series. So, a likely unintentional fastball had flattened Zimmerman, and while he waved away his manager and trainer, even mustering a grin as he did, and dusted off his uniform, Chirinos and James came to agreement on their next pitch, the one-ball, two-strike pitch, all the while considering the potentially altered temperament of the guy who\u2019d just been buzzed.\n\n\u201cSome guys get angry,\u201d James said. \u201cSome guys get a little more aggressive.\u201d\n\nNot Zimmerman, it didn\u2019t seem to James.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think he was upset at all,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he was a little startled.\u201d\n\nChirinos, then, got to thinking about what a veteran such as Zimmerman would be thinking about what Chirinos would be thinking.\n\n\u201cMe, personally, I get one high and close, I\u2019m kind of afraid to dive at the plate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kinda get scared.\u201d\n\nIt would not be the obvious pitch.\n\n\u201cI thought he was going to look for a slider, down and away,\u201d Chirinos said.\n\nThey threw a fastball, also over the strike zone. Zimmerman took it. Then he fouled a slider, the fifth pitch, the one he might have assumed was coming on the fourth pitch. The sixth pitch was also a fastball, which Zimmerman fouled, and was of enough interest to send Chirinos to the mound, where he was joined by shortstop Carlos Correa and pitching coach Brent Strom. The conversation was conducted with Chirinos\u2019 right arm looped around James\u2019 neck.\n\n\u201cWhatever he put down, I was going to throw,\u201d James said, a strategy that lasted a single pitch, a changeup out of the strike zone Zimmerman took to push the count full.\n\nChirinos then asked for another changeup. James shook him toward the slider.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was the right pitch,\u201d Chirinos said.\n\nSo he insisted. Changeup.\n\nSince Game 2, even in the moments after Game 2, a 12-3 loss that had turned humiliating in the late innings, the Astros had reminded each other who they are. What they are made of. How they are built. There was more baseball to play, plenty of it. Somehow they\u2019d get the ball back to Gerrit Cole, who\u2019d get it to Justin Verlander, but first they\u2019d have to win, starting with Greinke, then across a bullpen game after that. For his part, Chirinos had studied six hours of film before the series began, then another few hours before Game 3, then guided Greinke through his 14 outs, some of those while worried Greinke was tipping his curveball, seeing as how the Nationals were hitting it with such ease.\n\nThis is how a catcher arrives not at the slider, but at the changeup, in the very moment the only game they could win on this night teetered. This is why he insists.\n\n\u201cI knew if I got it relatively in the zone, around the zone, I could get him to swing,\u201d James said, much more confident in the pitch post-game. \u201cChinny called a great pitch.\u201d\n\nWhen they met in the dugout, Chirinos asked James about the slider and James said, \u201cI trust you. I knew when you put it down the second time it was the right pitch.\u201d\n\nZimmerman missed it. The Astros would win, 4-1. The series would survive at least another couple days. For a change, somebody else ended up in the dirt.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Since Game 2, even in the moments after Game 2, a 12-3 loss that had turned humiliating in the late innings, the Astros had reminded each other who they are.
