We\u2019ll literally find any excuse to slap a sausage between a bit of bread and coat it in sauce. School f\u00eates, election days, footy games\u2013hell, we even wheel out the BBQ literally every weekend at the local hardware store. There\u2019s no denying that the beloved sausage is an ingrained part of the Australian experience.\n\nMudgee will transform into a meaty district of sausso delights and events for one day, including meat feats of strength like gladiator battles with snags, sausso tossing, and a bunch og other stuff to determine the inaugural Sausage King or Queen.\n\nThe big sausage fest will also gather a whole host of local Mudgee butchers and sausage sommeliers offering their best wares, so if you consider yourself a purveyor of fine meats then you should probably start organising a road trip to the mid-west of NSW and lock in that leave now.\n\nIt also gives me the liberty to use one of the worst gifs I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "description": "Rally your Saturday morning snag crew, because a meat platter-worthy sausage fest is hitting mid-western NSW at the end of November.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/kel-knight-snag-fb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
