She replied that she voted for Evan McMullin, who ran as an independent.\n\nIf Meghan McCain is a registered Republican, she won't be able to vote for Biden in the primaries (both her native Arizona and current home of New York don't allow primary voters to cross party lines). She'll have to wait until the primaries are over, and if Biden becomes the nominee, then she could vote for him in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nBiden comforted McCain on \"The View\" after her father, his friend Sen. John McCain, was diagnosed with glioblastoma. \"The View\"\n\nDuring her \"WWHL\" appearance, McCain also explained her recent walk-off on \"The View.\" Cohen asked about a clip of McCain walking off set last Friday after a fight with co-host Ana Navarro. \"You seemed extra over it \u2014 with the audience, sometimes with the ladies,\" Cohen said.\n\nMcCain said the audience is often combative and the booing and heckling is a lot to deal with every day. As for her arguments with the other co-hosts, McCain said \"vibe-wise\" she's very comfortable with the other women on the show.\n\n\"The walking off footage, we are told by producers to leave the table if it's too heated,\" McCain explained. \"And I get touched up backstage with my makeup, so that's what I was doing. And I've done that many times over the years.\"\n\nCohen joked that she was like a \"real housewife\" walking off during a reunion show \u2014 a common occurrence in the Bravo universe. McCain responded, \"'The View' can be like the housewives sometimes.\"", "description": "\"I love him dearly and I think he is a truly decent, wonderful human being,\" the \"View\" co-host said about Biden", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/26/0b75e41b-095c-4132-83b4-9033d6c02805/thumbnail/1200x630/efcdae2bb091f24789f275d11693b3d1/meghan-copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
