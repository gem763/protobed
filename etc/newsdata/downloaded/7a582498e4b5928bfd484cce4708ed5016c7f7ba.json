British officials indicated on Monday that they believed only the two men were under US control.\n\nTurkey launched an offensive against the Kurdish-led SDF over its southern border on Wednesday, a move widely condemned by the international community for triggering a humanitarian disaster, opening a new front in Syria\u2019s complex war and risking the re-emergence of Isis, which lost control of its final slivers of territory in March.\n\nOn Sunday the US ordered all 1,000 US troops to withdraw \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d from the region after learning that the Turkish operation was likely to extend further than Ankara\u2019s proposed 20-mile (32km) \u201csafe zone\u201d on the border between the two countries.\n\nThe fate of the 10,000-plus Isis prisoners, whose numbers include at least 1,000 Britons and other foreigners, remains unclear as Turkey continues its invasion of Kurdish north-east Syria.\n\nBut there have been repeated warnings that they could be released or escape amid the chaos of an invasion, although they may also now fall into the hands of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, whose military is now entering north-east Syria at the invitation of the Syrian Kurds in an attempt to repel the Turks.\n\nOther fighters and Isis supporters remain in refugee camps \u2013 holding in excess of 100,000 \u2013 which were safeguarded by the Kurdish military, the Syrian Democratic Forces. On Sunday Kurdish officials said that around 850 foreigners had escaped from the camp at Ain Issa, near the frontline of the fighting.\n\nThe expectation is that Kotey and Elsheikh will be take from Iraq to Virginia, in the United States, where the courts are considered to be the most experienced in handling terror cases, although human rights lawyers said they would expect to challenge their forcible transfer across two borders.\n\nBritish politicians have previously indicated that the UK is happy to hand over the two men to be tried in the US, although that is being challenged by Elsheikh\u2019s mother in the British supreme court.", "description": "Despite earlier briefings that 40 were taken, only \u2018Beatles\u2019 duo are said to be under US control", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/926ea16ef817bc96d91197f251bc4c3419341537/0_322_5587_3352/master/5587.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08b94d9d254c4a062d02c63e1ba876dd", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
