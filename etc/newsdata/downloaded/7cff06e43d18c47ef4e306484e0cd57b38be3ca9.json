But he told reporters travelling with him that those details will be worked out over time.\n\nTrump nonetheless tweeted: \"USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home!\" This tweet was later deleted.\n\n\u201cThe ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.\u201d Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense. Ending endless wars! \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nThe Republican president declared this past week that Washington had no stake in defending the Kurdish fighters who died by the thousands as the U.S.'s partners fighting in Syria against ISIS extremists. Turkey conducted a week-long offensive into northeastern Syria against the Kurdish fighters before a military pause.\n\n\"It's time for us to come home,\" Trump said, defending his removal of U.S. troops from that part of Syria and praising his decision to send more troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran.\n\nEsper's comments to reporters travelling with him were the first to specifically lay out where American troops will go as they shift from Syria and what the counter-ISIS fight could look like. Esper said he has spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift about 1,000 troops from Syria into western Iraq.\n\nTrump's top aide, asked about the fact that the troops were not coming home as the president claimed they would, said, \"Well, they will eventually.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, seen at the White House with Vice-President Mike Pence on Friday, said Monday it was time for U.S. troops to 'come home' from the Middle East. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nActing Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox New's Sunday \"the quickest way to get them out of danger was to get them into Iraq.\"\n\nAs Esper left Washington on Saturday, U.S. troops were continuing to pull out of northern Syria after Turkey's invasion into the border region. Reports of sporadic clashes continued between Turkish-backed fighters and the Syria Kurdish forces despite a five-day cease-fire agreement hammered out Thursday between U.S. and Turkish leaders.\n\nThe Turkish military's death toll has risen to seven soldiers since it launched its offensive on Oct. 9.\n\nTrump ordered the bulk of the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria to withdraw after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear in a phone call that his forces were about to invade Syria to push back Kurdish forces that Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nThe pullout largely abandons America's Kurdish allies who have fought ISIS alongside U.S. troops for several years. Between 200 and 300 U.S. troops will remain at the southern Syrian outpost of Al-Tanf.\n\nEsper said the troops going into Iraq will have two missions.\n\n\"One is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,\" he said. \"Things could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that's the game plan right now.\"\n\nU.S. withdrawal to take 'weeks not days'\n\nThe U.S. has more than 5,000 American forces in Iraq, under an agreement between the two countries. The U.S. pulled its troops out of Iraq in 2011 when combat operations there ended, but they went back in after ISIS began to take over large swaths of the country in 2014. The number of U.S. forces in Iraq has remained small due to political sensitivities in the country, after years of what some Iraqis consider U.S. occupation during the war that began in 2003.\n\nEsper said he will talk with other allies at a NATO meeting in the coming week to discuss the way ahead for the counter-ISIS mission.\n\nU.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said Monday that forces currently deployed in Syria aren't coming home and the U.S. won't be leaving the Middle East yet. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nAsked if U.S. special operations forces will conduct unilateral military operations into Syria to go after ISIS, Esper said that option will be discussed with allies over time.\n\nHe said one of his top concerns is what the next phase of the counter-ISIS missions looks like, \"but we have to work through those details.\" He said that if U.S. forces do go in, they would be protected by American aircraft.\n\nWhile he acknowledged reports of intermittent fighting despite the cease-fire agreement, he said that overall it \"generally seems to be holding. We see a stability of the lines, if you will, on the ground.\"\n\nHe also said that, so far, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) that partnered with the U.S. to fight ISIS have maintained control of the prisons in Syria where they are still present. The Turks, he said, have indicated they have control of the ISIS prisons in their areas.\n\n\"I can't assess whether that's true or not without having people on the ground,\" said Esper.\n\nHe said the U.S. withdrawal will be deliberate and safe, and it will take \"weeks not days.\"\n\nAccording to a U.S. official, about a couple hundred troops have left Syria so far. The U.S. forces have been largely consolidated in one location in the West and a few locations in the East.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations, said the U.S. military is not closely monitoring the effectiveness of the ceasefire, but is aware of sporadic fighting and violations of the agreement. The official said it will still take a couple of weeks to get forces out of Syria.\n\nAlso Sunday, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi led a group of American lawmakers on a visit to Jordan to discuss \"the deepening crisis\" in Syria.\n\nJordan's state news agency Petra said that King Abdullah II, in a meeting with the U.S., stressed the importance of safeguarding Syria's territorial integrity and guarantees for the \"safe and voluntary\" return of refugees.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump insists he's bringing home Americans from \"endless wars\" in the Mideast, but his Pentagon chief says all U.S. troops leaving Syria will go to western Iraq, and the American military will continue operations against ISIS.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5328554.1571655605!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1166726818.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
