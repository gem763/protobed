For everyone living in this week\u2019s best new comics, the kids are doing from from all right. They\u2019re doing terribly.\n\nTwo supposed FBI agents looking for Oliver Flores. (Image: Clara Meath, Mark Englert, Taylor Esposito, Aftershock Comics)\n\nMidnight Vista\n\nLike so many kids who grew up with parents who resented one another, Oliver Flores clung to the things in life that gave him a modicum of happiness, like television and sugary treats \u2014 anything to distract him with the emotional chaos at home.\n\nOliver\u2019s small joys can\u2019t make him ignore the fact that his parents can\u2019t see eye to eye and aren\u2019t above using him as a pawn in their game of chess with one another, but the boy gets by, in part because he\u2019s got a friend in his stepfather who genuinely wants him to be happy and understand that none of what\u2019s going on is his fault.\n\nIt\u2019s on one of those nights when Oliver\u2019s parents are going at it over the phone that the boy and his stepfather go out to grab some ice cream and get away from the madness for a little while, but as they\u2019re making their way back home, something terrifying and mysterious happens before the pair vanish into thin air.\n\nIn the days, weeks, and months after Oliver\u2019s disappearance, local searches are a launched, and Oliver\u2019s case is put on the FBI\u2019s radar, with the agency believing him to have been kidnapped by his stepfather, but the two are never seen again.\n\nUntil one day, Oliver, fully-grown but still very much thinking like a young boy, just...shows up nearby his childhood home, naked and disoriented. Oliver has an idea about where he\u2019s been for all these years, but the truth is something no one around him is inclined to believe.\n\nArtist Clara Meath and colorist Mark Englert take writer Eliot Rahal\u2019s solid, but rather straightforward story and turn it into something otherworldly that smacks of classic of classic X-Files episodes with a touch of fairytale-like energy that speaks to Oliver being a boy-man out of time.\n\nThe first issue has its moments of surprisingly bold gross-out horror, but by the end, you\u2019ll want to know exactly what happened to Oliver and how he\u2019s managed to make his way back home.

Suffice to say that the first issue revolves around an interesting spin on the concept of being a \u201cchosen one\u201d when a hero knows that they are merely one among the chosen many.\n\nEvelyn Pierce is a nurse who specialises in delivering babies, Orbit is a world-famous superhero who secretly loathes her adoring fans, and Commander Marco is a battle-hardened warrior who wanders the deserts fighting off never-ending waves of marauders and criminals.\n\nEach of them holds a different set of skills, experiences, and worldviews that make them important within their respective realms, but being brought together shatters each of their assumptions that they were ever really all that unique within the grander scheme of things.

Culbard, Steven Wands, Dark Horse Comics)\n\nEverything\n\nThere\u2019s a very distinct and unsettling feeling that descends upon a town when a new megastore opens up for business and immediately makes it clear that it intends to become everyone\u2019s one-stop show for, well, everything. There were clearly dark things lurking in Holland, Michigan long before the Everything store opened its doors to much fanfare and elation from eager consumers, but the store\u2019s only begun to make things weirdly worse as Dark Horse\u2019 Everything opens.\n\nEveryone who meets Everything\u2019s store manager Shirley can sense that there\u2019s something off about the woman, but no one can quite put their finger on exactly what it is. It\u2019s not just the terrifying perma-smile artist I.N.J. Culbard and colourist Steven Wands illustrate her with in close-up shots, or the overenthusiastic way she evangelises everything about Everything, but rather the way she seems very much like a product of the store itself: perfectly pleasant, packaged, and presented to sell you things.\n\nBut the malevolent energy Everything\u2019s brought to Holland extends beyond Shirley and even the store itself. All throughout the city, inexplicable, horrific things begin to happen with alarming frequency and it\u2019s clear that \u2014 beyond big, big savings \u2014 what Everything\u2019s brought to town is something darker and more on-brand for a megastore than many people typically think of: It carries a kind of mystical consumerism that\u2019s threatening to devour Holland and the souls of its residents right up. (Christopher Cantwell, I.N.J. Culbard, Steven Wands, Dark Horse)\n\nJames explaining to his principal why he told a bully to fuck off. (Image: Werther Dell\u2019edera, Miquel Muerto, Boom Studios)\n\nSomething Is Killing the Children\n\nWhen kids go missing, the communities they\u2019re from panic, and when kids turn up dead, the panic in those communities transforms into raw fear, anger, and frustration. In Boom Studios\u2019 Something Is Killing the Children, swaths of kids are just disappearing or being murdered, with some being brutally maimed by whatever\u2019s lurking in their local woods.\n\nJames is one of the few children who\u2019s witnessed the... beast prowling his town that\u2019s apparently taken to hunting children and eviscerating them in ways that no human or animal should be capable of doing. While most people might assume that James escaping with his life makes him lucky, his survival puts him squarely on the radar of other kids and adults around him who frankly don\u2019t know what to make of what\u2019s happening to their town.\n\nJames doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of person who\u2019d lure his friends out into the woods, mutilate them, and then fling their entrails around like a monster, but James being able to return back to school when so many of his friends have died raises suspicions that he can\u2019t escape.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that James insists that the scary monster story he told his friends before they ended up being attacked seemingly ended up coming true right before the kids\u2019 eyes, but James is in luck. There\u2019s one person who\u2019s just walked into town that not only believes his story, but is going to need his help if they\u2019re going to figure out how to stop whatever\u2019s killing the children.
