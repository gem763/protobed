Tax rates, however, have yet to be decided.\n\nOnly companies with annual revenue of $825 million or more would be affected.\n\nThe OECD is taking public comments on the proposal through Nov. 12. The goal is to have a rule in place next year.\n\nPart of the drive for the new rules is to prevent large technology companies, like Amazon and Apple, from dodging tax obligations by routing profits through tax havens where they have little presence.\n\nWhile tech companies may be the most well-known target, the tax would apply to multinationals from other sectors, too.\n\nAs it stands now, individual countries are forging ahead with their own taxes on tech companies. The international rules would prevent a patchwork of different tax laws from countries across the globe.\n\nFrance, for example, approved a digital tax, to the dismay of the White House. President Trump threatened to impose tariffs in retaliation. The two sides have since resolved the dispute.\n\nTrump also threatened to retaliate against Italy after Reuters reported it is preparing a digital tax.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Global finance ministers weighed a proposal while meeting in D.C. this week.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/Amazon-Apple-Facebook-Microsoft.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
