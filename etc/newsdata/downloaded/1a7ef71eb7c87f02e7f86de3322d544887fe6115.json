Ridiculous': Northern Ireland ready to move on from Brexit", "language": "en", "text": "Many unionists are angry but widespread public disorder over deal seems unlikely\n\nThe last time Downing Street foisted a deal on Northern Ireland\u2019s unionists, the backlash was swift and bitter. Hundreds of thousands poured on to the streets to protest. A mob punched and kicked the secretary of state outside Belfast city hall. They hit him with a union jack-draped flagpole, grappled him into a headlock and chanted, \u201cTraitor, traitor, traitor.\u201d\n\nIt was 1985 and Margaret Thatcher had signed the Anglo-Irish agreement giving Dublin a say in Northern Ireland\u2019s affairs. It took burly bodyguards to save her secretary of state, Tom King, from the mob\u2019s wrath. Demonstrations, strikes and civil disobedience raged for months. \u201cWe say, \u2018Never, never, never, never!\u2019\u201d Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist party leader, bellowed to a crowd.\n\nThree decades later Boris Johnson has ignored DUP objections and negotiated a Brexit deal that would create a customs border down the Irish Sea. EU regulations would apply to all goods in Northern Ireland and the DUP would lose its veto on whether the new arrangements come into force.\n\nMany unionists inside and outside the party fear for Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the United Kingdom. Even before the deal was unveiled on Thursday, there were cries of betrayal and warnings about tumult and violence. But widespread public disorder seems unlikely.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Billy Hutchinson is leader of the Progressive Unionist party.

It\u2019s not the time to ratchet all this up,\u201d said Billy Hutchinson, a Belfast city councillor with the Progressive Unionist party (PUP), which is aligned with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitary group. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to go back to the bad old days. We won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nPeter Shirlow, a director at the University of Liverpool\u2019s Institute of Irish Studies and an authority on unionism, said there was little appetite for disruption. \u201cA lorry sitting in Larne having its contents checked won\u2019t drive them back to violence. The narrative is changing. Northern Ireland is not as dysfunctional as you think.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold statement, given that Downing Street has called the DUP\u2019s bluff and Northern Ireland has a power vacuum. The prime minister has gambled that he may yet get Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, onside or else shunt the deal through the House of Commons without support from the party\u2019s 10 MPs.\n\nThe DUP trapped itself over the past year by turning technical discussions over customs arrangements into \u201cblood red lines\u201d with lurid imagery: \u201cThis is a battle of who blinks first, and we\u2019ve cut off our eyelids.\u201d In recent weeks it compromised on regulatory checks and moderated its language, calling for a \u201csensible\u201d deal, but it stopped short of a full U-turn.\n\nMistrust between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in has stymied efforts to revive power-sharing, which collapsed more than 1,000 days ago, leaving the assembly and executive at Stormont mothballed. Add in Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s push for a referendum on Irish unity and attacks by dissident republicans and it is easy to envisage a loyalist backlash.\n\n\u201cA border down the Irish Sea would not be tolerated,\u201d said Jamie Bryson, a prominent blogger and activist. \u201cIt would be an economically united Ireland, which would mutilate the constitutional position of the UK. There would be an organic explosion of protest. Nobody knows where that would go. Once you push that genie out of the bottle, it\u2019s a dangerous situation \u2013 a powder-keg situation.\u201d\n\nBut there seems little appetite for mass unruly protest. Unionism is divided over Brexit: 47% of pro-union voters voted remain in the 2016 referendum. And there is a collective weariness, a desire to move on.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andrew Graham, manager of the Hillside pub in Hillsborough. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian\n\nIn Hillsborough, a prosperous, largely Protestant village in County Down where Thatcher signed the Anglo-Irish agreement, some expressed dismay at the prospect of Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK.\n\n\u201cIf there is a betrayal, there will be protests. To what extent I don\u2019t know,\u201d said one retailer, who declined to be named. \u201cIt\u2019s like Animal Farm: some people are better than others.\u201d\n\nOther residents said their overriding desire was to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. Few thought the union with the UK was imperilled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard that much conversation about the political side,\u201d said Andrew Graham, the manager of the Hillside pub. \u201cPeople are worried about house prices, about transport and farming. For those on the border, it could be make or break.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emma Grimley, a resident of Hillsborough, County Down. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian\n\nEmma Grimley yearned for a Brexit deal. \u201cOtherwise, would the food sector get mushrooms from Monaghan? It\u2019s simple things like that. If the country is prosperous and doing well \u2013 that\u2019s where my mindset is.\u201d\n\nA business consultant who declined to be named said a small minority could cause ructions but that others would accept a deal. \u201cThey\u2019ll have a bottle of shiraz and a nice meal. Betrayal? It\u2019s ridiculous, inflammatory language. Let\u2019s just get on with life.\u201d\n\nA surge in votes for the Alliance, Green and other non-aligned parties in recent elections showed some unionist voters were abandoning tribal traditions, said Shirlow. \u201cThere are two pro-union communities and the one that\u2019s growing is the progressive one. You have to realise that 47% who are pro-union voted to remain in Europe.\u201d\n\nSome opposition to the backstop echoed unionism\u2019s old existential dread, but that was balanced by economic pragmatism, said Paul Corthorn, a reader in modern British history at Queen\u2019s University and a biographer of Enoch Powell, who felt Thatcher betrayed him over the Anglo-Irish agreement. \u201cNow there is a separation of forces, a dispersal of unionist opinion.\u201d\n\nShoppers interviewed on Belfast\u2019s Shankill Road, where murals commemorate the Queen and loyalist paramilitaries, said they disapproved of a border down the Irish Sea, but did not plan to mount any barricades.\n\n\u201cIf a deal is done, protests won\u2019t change that,\u201d said Colin Brown, 63, a retired IT worker: \u201cI certainly won\u2019t protest. I\u2019m sick of listening to it. People are just fed up and don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nIt was a common sentiment: customs or no customs, do a deal and move on. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessarily that happy with it but you want something that works for everyone,\u201d said one woman, who declined to be named.\n\nJulian Smith, Johnson\u2019s Northern Ireland secretary, is spending the week at Stormont trying to break the political deadlock.
