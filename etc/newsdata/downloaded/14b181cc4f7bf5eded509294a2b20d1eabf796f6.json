Reporters were stationed on all seven continents. The news unit even managed to have the lights turned off on the Empire State Building and Times Square to symbolize the dire threat posed by the decline of the earth\u2019s natural support systems. Anchor Diane Sawyer had to use a flashlight \u2013 on camera \u2013 to maneuver around the set.\n\nBill Weir, then an ABC News correspondent who provided a report for the special from Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef, thought it marked the start of a real focus by TV-news outlets on the challenges of climate change. He was wrong.\n\nMore from Variety\n\n\u201cThe recession and Obamacare came,\u201d said Weir, who is now CNN\u2019s chief climate correspondent. \u201cWe had the rug pulled out from under us, those of us who care about the topic.\u201d Besides, he asks, \u201cwho wants to pop some corn and gather the kids around and watch a show about the end of the world?\u201d\n\nSeveral of the nation\u2019s biggest TV outlets hope that in 2019, the answer is \u201cMore than there used to be.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, TV news outlets that have found climate-change coverage difficult to emphasize for prolonged periods are warming up to more ambitious reporting. NBC News has launched a new \u201cclimate unit\u201d that will present reports throughout this week, says Janelle Rodriguez, the NBC News senior vice president who will oversee it, and has plans to live-stream a two-day forum on the topic from Georgetown University. CBS News has been running \u201cEye on Earth\u201d reports throughout its programs. CNN gained recent notice for an hours-long series of \u201ctown hall\u201d interviews with Democratic candidates on the topic.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss these efforts as something geared toward getting ratings around the time the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to release a dim report on the global climate in Monaco. But news executives and academics suggest the winds are shifting and that news aficionados can expect more stories about their environment to show up in their information diet.\n\n\u201cWe are not just going to do a week on this and then won\u2019t be talking about it again,\u201d says Rashida Jones, senior vice president of specials for NBC News and MSNBC. \u201cThis is the biggest story of our time.\u201d\n\nFor years, it has not been. Walter Cronkite had concerns about the planet, says Al Ortiz, CBS News\u2019 vice president of standards and practices, and late in his career anchored several long CBS News reports on the topic. But news presentations on the subject have in the more recent past often focused on the politics around climate change, rather than the deteriorating environment itself. NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d surprised critics and viewers in January when anchor Chuck Todd devoted an entire hour to the topic. He called climate change \u201ca literally Earth-changing subject that doesn\u2019t get talked about this thoroughly, on television news at least,\u201d and then announced the show wasn\u2019t going to treat the subject as if it were a matter for debate. \u201cThe Earth is getting hotter. And human activity is a major cause, period. We\u2019re not going to give time to climate deniers.\u201d\n\nWhile many other nations have pronounced the issue a threat, the U.S. has gotten bogged down over whether citizens believe the issue is real. \u201cTV news felt the need to be balanced, but balance isn\u2019t the same thing as being accurate,\u201d says Jeffrey Blevins, who heads the journalism department at the University of Cincinnati and has studied how the media covers divisive issues. As a result, the issue of climate change often \u201clooks like a toss-up\u201d in TV programming, he says, and the networks often cover it as a debate rather than a certainty.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d says Blevins. \u201cPolitics is better television than science.\u201d\n\nA funny thing has happened, however, on the way to the potential apocalypse. Climate change has moved from a topic of discussion to a phenomenon that turns up in people\u2019s backyards. Intense hurricanes and tornadoes are swirling around the nation with greater frequency. Rainfall is often increasing, along with flooding. The weather is hard to dismiss, notes Al Roker, the weather anchor for NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d and a co-anchor of the show\u2019s third hour. And news units have a raft of statistics about intensifying hurricane speeds and inches of rainfall to deploy.", "description": "More than a decade ago, ABC News pulled off an amazing feat: a 2007 special edition of \u201c20/20\u201d that called attention to the rapid deterioration of the global environment.
