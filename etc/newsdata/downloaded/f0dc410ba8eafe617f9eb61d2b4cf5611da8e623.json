Like many others, he was disappointed in the secretary\u2019s lack of public support for diplomats who have been named in the Ukraine controversy and called to testify before House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry into the actions of Trump and his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nConcern has been especially high for Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Pompeo recalled from her post when a right-wing media campaign accused her of disloyalty. Yovanovitch had questioned Giuliani\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani has said that Trump ordered Pompeo to fire her. In his July telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment investigation, Trump called Yovanovitch \u201cbad\u201d and said \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d\n\nNow a fellow at Georgetown University on leave from the State Department, Yovonovitch is scheduled to give a deposition to investigating committees on Friday.\n\nAD", "description": "The resignation of Michael McKinley, who was a conduit between the office of the secretary of state and the career Foreign Service, comes amid plummeting morale in the department.", "authors": ["Karen Deyoung", "Associate Editor", "Senior National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uglYbVYAIIKb5o1woRyEi7iDzE4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G7LACGHLYAI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
