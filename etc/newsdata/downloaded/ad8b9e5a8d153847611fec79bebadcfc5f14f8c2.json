However, the total plastic waste footprint of Halloween will be even higher once you take into account other Halloween plastic such as party kits and decorations, much of which are also plastic, or food packaging.\u201d\n\nHubbub and The Fairyland Trust are also calling for better and more consistent labelling on Halloween costumes as it suggests many consumers do not realise that materials such as polyester are plastic.\n\nA 2017 study by environmental charity the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) found that less than one per cent of material used to produce clothing, such as polyester, is recycled.\n\nLaura Balmond, project manager of Make Fashion Circular at EMF previously told The Independent that synthetic fabrics account for 63 per cent of the material input for textiles production.\n\nBalmond added that plastic-based fibres negatively impact because they are not biodegradable and rely on fossil fuel extraction.\n\nSpeaking of the recent findings, Paula Chin, sustainable materials specialist at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), said: \u201cThere is nothing scarier than our throwaway culture.\n\n\u201cBy reducing the amount of plastic we buy, embracing reusable items and taking responsibility for our waste, we can make sure Halloween is suitably spooky and sustainable.\u201d", "description": "An estimated 2,000 tonnes of plastic waste \u2013 equivalent to 83m bottles \u2013 will be generated from Halloween costumes sold by leading retailers in the UK this year, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/18/10/halloween-children.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
