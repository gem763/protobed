Turla specifically targeted victims in countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn some cases, the agencies found that Turla attacked the same victims that the Iranian hacking groups that created the tools had previously targeted.\n\nThe NSA noted in its joint advisory with the NCSC that Turla stole data from Iranian infrastructure as well, including directory listings and files, enabling Turla to gain \u201cunprecedented insights\u201d into the strategies used by the Iranian hacking group to target victims.\n\nThe NSA and NCSC wrote that the Iranian hackers behind the creation of the cyber tools used by Turla \u201cwere almost certainly not aware of, or complicit with, Turla\u2019s use of their implants.\u201d\n\nPaul Chichester, the director of operations at the NCSC, said in a statement that \u201cIdentifying those responsible for attacks can be very difficult, but the weight of evidence points towards the Turla group being behind this campaign.\u201d\n\nChichester added that \u201cWe want to send a clear message that even when cyber actors seek to mask their identity, our capabilities will ultimately identify them. Turla acquired access to Iranian tools and the ability to identify and exploit them to further their own aims.\u201d\n\nThe NSA wrote that \u201cwhile attribution of attacks and proving authorship of tools can be very difficult \u2013 particularly in the space of incident response on a victim network \u2013 the weight of evidence demonstrates that Turla had access to Iranian tools and the ability to identify and exploit them to further Turla\u2019s own aims.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NCSC, Turla is an active cyber group that regularly targets government, military, technology, energy and commercial groups to obtain information.\n\nThe announcement of these cyber activities comes after a ramp-up in cyber activities between the U.S. and Iran in recent months. Reuters reported last week that the U.S. had attacked Iran\u2019s ability to spread \u201cpropaganda\u201d in retaliation for what the U.S. claims were Iranian airstrikes on Saudi Arabian oil facilities.", "description": "A suspected Russia-backed cyber hacking group used Iranian tools to attack 35 countries, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warned Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/electionhacking_062317getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
