Humans to be replaced by artificial lifeforms", "language": "en", "text": "You can stop worrying about global warming now (assuming you actually were) because none of that stuff is going to matter in a couple of decades. According to British futurist and environmentalist James Lovelock, the day is coming \u2013 probably in your lifetime \u2013 when our technology is going to \u201cevolve\u201d on its own and become so vastly more intelligent and capable than us that we will almost immediately become irrelevant. He foresees the rapid rise of a generation of cyborgs, but he\u2019s not talking about human beings combing robotics into our frames. They will have no use for us or any contribution we might make to the mix. These cyborgs will build themselves. (NBC News)\n\nFor tens of thousands of years, humans have reigned as our planet\u2019s only intelligent, self-aware species. But the rise of intelligent machines means that could change soon, perhaps in our own lifetimes. Not long after that, Homo sapiens could vanish from Earth entirely. That\u2019s the jarring message of a new book by James Lovelock, the famed British environmentalist and futurist. \u201cOur supremacy as the prime understanders of the cosmos is rapidly coming to end,\u201d he says in the book, \u201cNovacene.\u201d \u201cThe understanders of the future will not be humans but what I choose to call \u2018cyborgs\u2019 that will have designed and built themselves.\u201d Lovelock describes cyborgs as the self-sufficient, self-aware descendants of today\u2019s robots and artificial intelligence systems. He calls the looming era of their dominance the Novacene \u2014 literally, the \u201cnew new\u201d age.\n\nWe should probably note (with making any specific diagnoses) that Lovelock just recently celebrated his 100th birthday, so I don\u2019t know if that plays into his thought process here or not. But let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt for now.\n\nThe author sees this rise of the machines as the dawning of the Novacene era of Earth\u2019s history. (We\u2019re currently in the Holocene era.) And it will be the last era where man walks the Earth. Indeed, it may be the end of all biological life on the planet and the beginning of a new world tailored to the needs of machines.\n\nLovelock doesn\u2019t get around to saying precisely how we\u2019re going to be wiped out. In fact, he suggests that our new machine overlords might actually find us rather interesting, at least in a lab animal/pet sort of way, and want to keep us around for a while. Well, some of us at least. But in the end, these new cyborgs will almost certainly realize that they can improve conditions on the planet for themselves. For example, oxygen leads to rust, so they might decide to kill off all the plants so their metal frames don\u2019t fall apart so quickly. Of course, total oxygen depletion would be problematic for the remaining humans.\n\nIs any of this even possible? Lovelock is hailed in some circles as a genius, so I won\u2019t write him off entirely. But I\u2019ve been pondering some of these questions for a long time and researching what others have accomplished in related fields. I can assure you that not everyone is convinced that a sentient artificial intelligence capable of original thought is even possible. And that\u2019s because we still don\u2019t even know how the human brain works.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. We\u2019ve made great advances in addressing medical problems in our brains. We\u2019ve also learned loads about which portions of the brain are used for various types of thinking and activities. But we still don\u2019t really know how we think. How we store, process and recall memories. There is no formula for consciousness. How can we create a conscious machine when we don\u2019t even know how we manage the feat ourselves?\n\nThat\u2019s the missing piece of the puzzle. And without it, there\u2019s no true, independent AI and none of Lovelock\u2019s cyborgs. So maybe you shouldn\u2019t start spending all of your retirement savings in Vegas just yet.", "description": "Well, we had a good run", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/RobotPepper.jpg"}
