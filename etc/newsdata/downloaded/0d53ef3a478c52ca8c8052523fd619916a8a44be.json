If confirmed by the European Parliament he would be in charge of the EU's single market.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAtos, which holds billions in UK government contracts, has a controversial reputation in Britain.\n\nThe firm became the subject of protests while it ran disability benefits assessments for the DWP: a contract it quit early in 2014 after more than 600,000 appeals were lodged against its decisions. Four in 10 of Atos assessors' original decision were overturned, costing taxpayers \u00a360 million a year.\n\nIn 2013 the firm was criticised after it was found to pay no corporation in the preceding year, despite profiting from huge volumes of government contracts. In 2016 the government announced that it would review all Atos contract over \u00a310 million after a scathing report from the public accounts committee that found the company did not show an \u201cappropriate duty of care to the taxpayer\u201d when doing work for the NHS.\n\nMr Breton, 64, hails from the large centre-right European People's Party group rather than Mr Macron's own liberal one \u2013 a fact likely to increase his chances of getting past MEPs.\n\nOne Elysee official said of the pick: \u201cHe\u2019s man of action who knows industrial issues inside out and who, while knowing Brussels institutions, will not have a bureaucratic approach to European issues, which is important for the president.\"\n\nMr Macron's previous pick was Sylvie Goulard. She was rejected overwhelmingly by MEPs after she failed to answer questions about alleged conflicts of interests, as well as the breadth of her portfolio, which also included defence, space, and industrial strategy on top of managing the internal market.\n\nMr Breton is expected to have the same unchanged, broad portfolio \u2013 meaning his appointment is likely to be highly scrutinised by MEPs.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
