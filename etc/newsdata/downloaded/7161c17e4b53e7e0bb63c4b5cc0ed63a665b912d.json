We\u2019ll take a very strong look at it,\u201d he said, raising concerns among observers that the process would be improperly influenced.\n\nAmazon said late Friday it was \u201csurprised about this conclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from AFP.\n\n\u2013 Necessary evil? \u2013\n\nThe contract has caused controversy over whether internet giants who say they want to make the world better should be involved in the defense industry.\n\nJEDI critics have likened it to the nefarious \u201cSkynet\u201d computing overlord in \u201cTerminator\u201d films.\n\nMicrosoft was Amazon\u2019s only rival in the final bidding for the winner-take-all contract, despite employees urging it to drop out.\n\n\u201cMany Microsoft employees don\u2019t believe that what we build should be used for waging war,\u201d company staffers wrote in an anonymous op-ed posted a year ago on Medium, which said it had verified the authenticity of the piece.\n\n\u201cThe contract is massive in scope and shrouded in secrecy, which makes it nearly impossible to know what we as workers would be building.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft has defended its interest in military contracts, saying at one point, \u201cAll of us who live in this country depend on its strong defense.\u201d\n\nAmazon chief Bezos had also defended the company\u2019s bid, saying it was important to support US defense efforts, even if it is unpopular.\n\n\u2013 Cloud cash \u2013\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives expected Amazon, and perhaps others, to challenge the Pentagon contract decision in court but still saw it giving a major lift to Microsoft\u2019s cloud business in a market where $1 trillion is expected to be spent in the coming decade.\n\n\u201cThis is a game changer deal for Microsoft to win as this will have a ripple effect for the company\u2019s cloud business for years to come,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile the current political landscape further complicated this high stakes bake-off with JEDI, both Microsoft and Amazon among others will have much to gain over the coming years in these cloud sweepstakes.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft this week reported that quarterly profits rose 21 percent on the back of its thriving cloud computing business which has become a core focus for the US technology giant.\n\nThe tactic is a major switch from the way the Redmond-based company built its empire selling packaged software to computer users.\n\nAmazon, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, has expanded from its origins in e-commerce to cloud services, streaming media, artificial intelligence and other ventures.\n\nAmazon Web Services accounted for nearly $9 billion in revenue in the recently-ended quarter, with growth in the cloud computing unit up 35 percent from a year ago.", "description": "San Francisco (AFP) \u2013 The Pentagon said Friday it is awarding a $10 billion cloud computing contract to Microsoft, following a highly scrutinized", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/ae93b4_pentagon-earlier-year-put-off-awarding-hefty-computing-contract-deciding-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
