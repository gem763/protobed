REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo/File Photo\n\nNegative rate policy is something Fed officials have downplayed as appropriate in the U.S. because of the risks it entails and the likely political opposition.\n\nOnce considered only for economies with chronically low inflation such as Europe and Japan, however, the idea is becoming a more attractive option for some other central banks to counter unwelcome rises in their currencies.\n\nThis is how a negative rate policy works and its potential pitfalls:\n\nWHY HAVE SOME CENTRAL BANKS ADOPTED NEGATIVE RATES?\n\nTo battle the global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, many central banks cut interest rates near zero. A decade later, interest rates remain low in most countries due to subdued economic growth.\n\nWith little room to cut rates further, some major central banks have resorted to unconventional policy measures, including a negative rate policy. The euro area, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Japan have allowed rates to fall slightly below zero.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nUnder a negative rate policy, financial institutions are required to pay interest for parking excess reserves with the central bank. That way, central banks penalize financial institutions for holding on to cash in hope of prompting them to boost lending.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) introduced negative rates in June 2014, lowering its deposit rate to -0.1% to stimulate the economy. Given rising economic risks, markets expect the ECB to cut the deposit rate, now at -0.4%, in September.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BOJ) adopted negative rates in January 2016, mostly to fend off an unwelcome yen spike from hurting an export-reliant economy. It charges 0.1% interest on a portion of excess reserves financial institutions park with the BOJ.\n\nWHAT ARE THE PROS, CONS?\n\nAside from lowering borrowing costs, advocates of negative rates say they help weaken a country\u2019s currency rate by making it a less attractive investment than that of other currencies. A weaker currency gives a country\u2019s export a competitive advantage and boosts inflation by pushing up import costs.\n\nBut negative rates put downward pressure on the entire yield curve and narrow the margin that financial institutions earn from lending. If prolonged ultra-low rates hurt the health of financial institutions too much, they could hold off on lending and damage the economy.\n\nThere are also limits to how deep central banks can push rates into negative territory - depositors can avoid being charged negative rates on their bank deposits by choosing to hold physical cash instead.\n\nWHAT ARE CENTRAL BANKS DOING TO MITIGATE THE SIDE-EFFECTS?\n\nThe BOJ adopts a tiered system under which it charges 0.1% interest only to a small portion of excess reserves financial institutions deposit with the central bank. It applies a zero or +0.1% interest rate to the rest of the reserves.\n\nThe ECB is also expected to take \u201cmitigating measures,\u201d such as a partial exemption from the charge in the form of tiered deposits rates, if it were to deepen negative rates from the current -0.4%, analysts say.\n\nBut designing such a scheme won\u2019t be easy in a bloc where cash is distributed unevenly among countries. It could even backfire by pushing rates up in certain countries, rather than down.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve drive interest rates into negative territory.
