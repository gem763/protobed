Don\u2019t Tell Me!\u2019 host Peter Sagal apologizes", "language": "en", "text": "The night before, he\u2019d introduced Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the renowned D.C. chef, during a live taping of the Chicago-based show at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna.\n\nAndr\u00e9s \u201cis known for recently going to Puerto Rico and giving out thousands of meals to hurricane survivors for free,\u201d Sagal had said, \u201cprompting everyone back home in D.C. to say, \u2018Hey, the Metro flooded that one time, where\u2019s our food?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Metro can get the best of you sometimes, and you find yourself acting in a way that makes you need to apologize \u2014 though few do.\n\nSagal had one of those moments, as he hurried back from D.C. to his hotel in Tysons Corner on the Silver Line.\n\nEarlier, as he was leaving for D.C., he\u2019d puzzled at the array of prices on the chart above the fare machine at Tysons, unsure how much to load on his SmarTrip card.\n\n\u201cFinally I said, \u2018The hell with it,\u2019 and picked some round number like $4,\u201d Sagal told DC Rider.\n\nWhich wasn\u2019t quite enough.\n\nWhen he got off at Tysons later, with a half-hour to get ready to leave for Wolf Trap, he fed the ticket into the machine and wondered why the gate didn\u2019t open.\n\nIt began, \u201ca series of events and increasing frustration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe sun was in an angle so you couldn\u2019t read the display,\u201d he said. He cupped his hand to shield the sun and saw he was 25 cents short.\n\n\u201c25 cents!\u201d he said.\n\nMetro announced plans last April to debut a mobile app this year that will let riders out of the gate with the tap of a smartphone. If you\u2019re in a predicament like Sagal\u2019s, you\u2019ll be able to add money to the app with a credit card.\n\nBut there\u2019s no app yet, so he went to the \u201cExitFare\u201d machine before the gates, where riders with insufficient funds can add to their fare cards.\n\n\u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t take credit cards,\" he said, \u201ceven though the machine where I bought the card does take credit cards.\"\n\nHe hadn\u2019t noticed the machine says, \u201c$1, $5, $10,\u201d so he slid in one of the $20 bills he had on him, then watched the machine spit it out. He slid it back in and saw it slide out.\n\nBack in again ... and back out \u2026\n\nSagal grew up in New Jersey but spent summers in Cambridge, Mass., where his grandparents owned a corner grocery store. He used to work there sometimes. \u201cSo I know what it\u2019s like to stand there in an apron and get yelled at,\u201d he said.\n\nBut seeing the $20 bill come back out broke him.\n\n\u201cI was having that particular emotional break that only happens when a trivial situation gradually escalates,\u201d he said.\n\nHe approached the station manager\u2019s booth and knocked.\n\nOut spewed his frustrations: about the sun\u2019s glare, the machine that wouldn\u2019t take credit cards or cash either. He just wanted to get out.\n\n\u201cNot any one of those things would spur entitled white-guy rage,\u201d he said, \u201cbut cumulatively I completely lost my cool and I\u2019m completely embarrassed.\u201d\n\nThe station manager just looked back and said nothing. \u201cI could tell he\u2019d dealt with this before,\u201d Sagal said.\n\nIt also seemed to Sagal that the manager was making a calculation in his head. Was it really worth it to take this ranting guy to a fare machine on the other side of the gate, and walk him through using his credit card to load 25 cents?\n\nNah.\n\nThe manager said nothing, instead reaching into his pocket and handing Sagal a quarter.\n\nSagal wants to send him a note to say thanks, maybe offer some \u201cWait, Wait\u201d paraphernalia. And a quarter. But he didn\u2019t catch his name. The manager wasn\u2019t available to comment last week, a Metro spokeswoman said.\n\nSagal has been thinking about his privilege. He\u2019d been on his way to his \"cushy job,\u201d and ranted at a man in a booth who probably has his own problems.\n\n\u201cI just felt bad some poor guy had to deal with it, and how in a small measure I\u2019d contributed to that guy\u2019s bad day,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he went on Twitter to apologize.\n\nThe toughest thing in any service industry must be handling panicked white guys who are just not used to any difficulty at all. He did it well. \u2014 Peter Sagal (@petersagal) August 30, 2019\n\n\u201cThe toughest thing in any service industry must be handling panicked white guys who are just not used to any difficulty at all,\" Sagal wrote. \"He did it well.\u201d", "description": "After some time to reflect, Peter Sagal recognized that his rant over being 25 cents short stemmed from his own privilege.", "authors": ["Kery Murakami", "Express D.C.
