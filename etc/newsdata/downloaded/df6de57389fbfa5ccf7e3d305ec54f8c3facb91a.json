The Tartan Army won't look at the 57 minutes of solid Scotland defending or a promising start to the second half. Football fans look only at the bottom line and right now it makes for grim reading.\n\nYet another 4-0 defeat in a Euro 2020 qualifier. More awful defending from set-pieces. More collapsing like a pack of cards after losing the first goal. Scotland have become embarassingly easy to beat and the Aston Villa midfielder admits it has to stop.\n\n'It was horrible in the dressing room at the end,' said McGinn. 'Everyone wants the same thing, we all want to be successful. There are no bad lads in there, we're all working together and it hurts when it goes the way it did here.\n\nRussia's forward Artem Dzyuba celebrates after scoring the first goal of the match on Thursday\n\n'Unless we start learning fast how to deal with certain situations in these games we'll keep getting punished.\n\n'There's no one hurting more than us. We're hurting for the supporters and the manager, for everyone who cares about the team. It's not a good feeling.'\n\nMauled by a Russian bear Scotland retreated to lick their wounds last night. A home game against San Marino on Sunday will be lucky to reach a crowd of five figures, doing nothing to improve the death pall hanging over the national team right now. Against a team who shipped nine goals to Belgium the Scots won't have to defend with anything like the same rigour they did against Russia. Perhaps it's just as well.\n\n'I'm not sure why we don't react to setbacks with Scotland the way we do with our clubs,' said McGinn. 'I'd love to be able to put a finger on it and sort it out. We're desperate to turn it round and when we work out what's going wrong it'll be such a positive for the country.\n\nDzyuba broke the deadlock in the 57th minute and Scotland then fell apart in the second half\n\n'But believe me, until then we're trying as hard as we can to change things.\n\n'It's frustrating, We have so many guys playing at a high level for their clubs, but we don't seem able to replicate what we do week after week when we come together for our country.\n\n'Whatever the reason, we need to find a solution quickly.\n\n'Russia are a good side and at home they're definitely much better than the side we faced at Hampden. But even then, if you allow any kind of player time and space they'll make you pay.\n\n'If we want to get to tournaments, we're going to have to find a way to come to places like this and get results. That's the bottom line. We're just not doing enough.'\n\nDzyuba celebrates adding a third for his side to pile pressure on Scotland boss Steve Clarke\n\nThree games remain in a dismal qualifying campaign and all three now serve the purpose of finding some confidence and form ahead of the Nations League play-offs in March. The road to redemption begins at Hampden on Sunday.\n\n'Every game's so important now. We've heading towards those two games that could put us in the finals and it's up to us as players to find some form and get the results that will take us there in a better frame of mind.\n\n'As for positives, I thought Lawrence Shankland was excellent when he came on at half-time.\n\n'He was really impressive and I'm sure of he keeps playing like that he'll be involved plenty in the future.'\n\nShankland's debut as a second half replacement for the frustrating figure of Oli Burke was one of the few bright spots of a grim night in the Luzhniki Stadium.\n\nRussia's Magomed Ozdoyev (C kneeling) celebrates after scoring the second for his side\n\nThe first Scottish championship player to play for the national team since McGinn in 2017 the Dundee United striker had mixed emotions.\n\n'It was a tough evening. It was a couple of sloppy goals that we've lost, the first one especially from a set play.\n\n'And then it was a bit of a wonderstrike for the second, but we could maybe get out and press the ball a bit harder.\n\n'It was just a really disappointing night and no real excuses from the boys.\n\n'It is obviously a great experience to get on, especially in this stadium.\n\n'But all in all I'm there to do a job and I want to win the game with the boys, much as it's my debut.\n\nAleksandr Golovin, second right, celebrates with team-mates after scoring his side's fourth\n\n'I'm there to do a job and we've not done it tonight unfortunately.'\n\nIronically the Scots were having their best spell in the game when the Russians scored their first goal, Shankland doing what Burke couldn't by showing holding the ball up and bringing others into the play.\n\n'I've come here and managed to get an opportunity tonight even if the result wasn't what I wanted it to be.\n\n'It's just a case of getting back and trying to pick ourselves up before the game on Sunday. We need to be 100% ready to go out and put in a performance.\n\n'No disrespect to San Marino at all. It will be a tough fixture for us as every international is.\n\n'But it's at home and it's a game we are expected to go and win.\n\n'Hopefully we can go there and put on a performance.\n\n'I'm desperate to get a start as anybody would.\n\n'It's all about experiences but I have given myself half a chance, though it's something I'm not really looking at tonight.'\n\nAberdeen's Mikey Devlin was another debutant in central defence and was unable to hide his bitter disappointment at the way the night ended.\n\n'I'm gutted that on what is a proud night for me and my family, ultimately the team the country is the most important thing and we're gutted it ended the way it did.\n\n'Maybe it's something I'll look back on and be proud of and I'm very grateful for the manager giving me the opportunity. But we didn't repay that faith he showed in us against a good side.'", "description": "The Tartan Army won't look at the 57 minutes of solid Scotland defending or a promising start to the second half.
