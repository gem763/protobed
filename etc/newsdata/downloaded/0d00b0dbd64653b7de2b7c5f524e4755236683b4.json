NYU Journalism professor Jay Rosen said asking Elizabeth Warren about raising middle-class taxes to fund Medicare for All should be disqualifying\u2026for the journalists who ask:\n\nThe \"make Elizabeth warren say she would raise taxes on the middle class\" question should be a credibility killer. For the journalists who keep asking it. \u2014 Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) October 16, 2019\n\nThe Post\u2019s Margaret Sullivan then chimed in with her own, similar take and Rosen praised it:\n\nI like the way you put it. \"Of course, it\u2019s legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad, and misses the larger lens of overall costs. (Warren, notably, refused to take the bait.)\" \u2014 Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) October 16, 2019\n\nBottom line: Journalists shouldn\u2019t ask questions that expose a Democrat\u2019s political weakness because that might benefit Republicans. That\u2019s literally the argument being made here without a hint of self-awareness or shame. I\u2019m not sure if this response was in earnest but either way, it\u2019s perfect:\n\nThank you guys for protecting warren. It\u2019s a tough fight but she\u2019s our best chance to beat trump! \u2014 Ex Buzzfeed Reporter (@BuzzfeedEx) October 16, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s what set them off. During the debate last night, Elizabeth Warren once again refused to answer direct questions about whether taxes would go up to fund Medicare for All. She was pressed on her refusal to give a straight answer to that question during the debate itself by Pete Buttigieg. Notice that for Buttigieg this isn\u2019t just a gotcha question. He\u2019s trying to make the case that his plan, which doesn\u2019t eliminate private insurance is better so the issue of raising taxes is a key way of differentiating his plan from hers:\n\nAfter the debate, Warren was asked the same question several times by a CNN roundtable (video below). John King suggested Warren would be better off being direct with people. Referencing the passage of Obamacare, King said, \u201cThings like \u2018If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor\u2019 the American people took as \u2018You lied to us.\u2019 And it made the politics harder.\u201d\n\nWarren still wouldn\u2019t change her formulation but did explain herself a bit saying the insurance companies were out there \u201ctrying to sell the message that this is all about costs.\u201d\n\nApparently, Warren\u2019s plea to not to have to offer a straight question about taxes won over some folks at CNN. This morning Pete Buttigieg was pressed by Alisyn Camerota on why it matters so long as costs go down. \u201cWhat does it matter to you what bucket it comes out of?\u201d she asked.\n\nI guess this is the kind of questioning Jay Rosen and Margaret Sullivan would approve.\n\nButtigieg offers a pretty good answer, saying it is, \u201cimportant to have yes or no answers to yes or no questions at a time when people are so frustrated with Washington-speak.\u201d\n\nPete keep up the health care attacks on Warren this morning.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for Senator Warren but last night she was more specific about the number of selfies she\u2019s taken than about how this plan is going to be funded.\u201d\n\npic.twitter.com/asOJwZzHw1 \u2014 Alex Thompson (@AlxThomp) October 16, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this sort of thing before. We saw it when Democrats and the media refused to tell the truth about the public option, which was always intended to lead the country to single-payer. We saw it when Democrats and the media echoed Obama\u2019s claims that people would be able to keep their plans and only later acknowledged this has been an intentional lie all along. Now here we go again with Democrats and the media openly suggesting a leading Democratic should be given a pass on a direct question about taxes because the truth might hurt her. Health care really seems to bring out the worst in progressive media hacks.\n\nHere\u2019s the CNN roundtable trying to get Warren to answer the taxes question. If you\u2019ve had enough of Warren\u2019s dodging of that particular question, skip forward to about 6:50 where Van Jones makes a really good point about the bad politics of Medicare for All. Jones compares it to public transportation saying Medicare for All is equivalent to telling people they have to take the subway whether they want to or not. As you\u2019ll see, Warren\u2019s answer is to filibuster with another town hall story rather than answer the direct question.", "description": "\"Thank you guys for protecting warren.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Warren-Buttigieg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
