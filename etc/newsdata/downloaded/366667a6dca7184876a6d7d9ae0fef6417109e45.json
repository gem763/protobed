Macron recently threatened to scrap the trade deal agreed between the European Union and Mercosur, the South American customs union, unless Brazil did more to preserve the Amazon rainforest. While few other EU leaders agree with his idea of ditching the agreement, Bolsonaro risks alienating the moderate European politicians who still need to ratify the deal. Many lawmakers in both Germany and Ireland are already reluctant to do so.\n\nMacron Attacks Bolsonaro for Sexist Jibe at French First Lady\n\nBrazil\u2019s relationship with France started to nosedive after Bolsonaro canceled a meeting in Brasilia with the French foreign minister at the last minute in favor of having his hair cut during a Facebook Live. Shortly afterwards, on the eve of last month\u2019s G-7 summit, Macron tweeted his concern about the fires burning in the Amazon and called for an international response, prompting an angry reaction from the Brazilian president.\n\nBolsonaro subsequently posted a sarcastic comment on a social media post mocking Brigitte Macron\u2019s physical appearance. The French leader called the comment \u201cextraordinarily disrespectful to my wife\u201d and added that he hoped the Brazilian people would soon have a president worthy of them.\n\n(Updates with Guedes\u2019 apology in fifth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Simone Iglesias in Bras\u00edlia at spiglesias@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Juan Pablo Spinetto at jspinetto@bloomberg.net, Bruce Douglas, Walter Brandimarte\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Brazil\u2019s Economy Minister reignited President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s spat with his French counterpart after he repeated the Brazilian leader\u2019s insults about Emmanuel Macron\u2019s wife.In a speech to businessmen in the northeastern city of Fortaleza, Paulo Guedes complained about the media coverage", "authors": ["Simone Iglesias"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
