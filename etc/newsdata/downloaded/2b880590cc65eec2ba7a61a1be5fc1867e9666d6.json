Among those applying pressure was Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who had sent letters to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security seeking updates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is no indication that any of those scrutinized will be sanctioned, but many received letters saying they were judged to have been involved in \u201cvalid\u201d security incidents even if \u201cnot culpable\u201d of a formal breach \u2014 an ambiguous status that some fear could complicate their abilities to return to government service.\n\nThe report does not identify those who were scrutinized, but the list included ambassadors and assistant secretaries of state responsible for U.S. policy in the Middle East, Europe and Central Asia.\n\nFew had sent emails directly to Clinton, and instead had routed them to William Burns, who served as deputy secretary of state, or Jake Sullivan, the former director of policy planning. They then relayed many of the messages to Clinton\u2019s private email, a system she said she used mainly out of convenience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nClinton\u2019s use of a private server, discovered by House Republicans as part of the probe of the deaths of U.S. diplomats and intelligence personnel in Benghazi, Libya, triggered overlapping investigations by Congress, the State Department and the FBI.\n\nThen-FBI Director James B. Comey\u2019s handling of the matter enraged Democrats. In July 2016, Comey took the extraordinary step of announcing there would be no charges filed against Clinton in the email probe, but accused her of being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in a news conference.\n\nThe bureau reopened the investigation in the final days of the 2016 race after discovering a laptop with Clinton emails as part of a separate case. Most were duplicates, and, again, there were no charges, but Comey\u2019s decision to notify Congress revived the issue at a moment that Clinton has said was devastating to her campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department suspended its internal review while the FBI probe was active, before resuming work in 2017. In total, the report found 91 violations by 38 individuals, and another 497 violations \u201cwhere no individual was found to bear culpability.\u201d\n\nThe review did not encompass a separate collection of emails that Clinton\u2019s lawyers withheld from the State Department and that she later destroyed, saying they were private and did not pertain to government business \u2014 a determination that was not verified by State Department officials.\n\nAD", "description": "The years-long inquiry is an anticlimactic end to a controversy that overshadowed the 2016 campaign.", "authors": ["Greg Miller", "National Security", "Intelligence"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uRdJRf-68rU_gyfWmxTQo1hM3iA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZDEQNXR5YI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
