There is serious, organised violence ... but I reiterate that we are not being overwhelmed,\" he said after visiting injured police in hospital.\n\nReporting from the Catalan capital, Al Jazeera's Sonia Gallego said the situation still remained tense on Saturday.\n\n\"Scores of anti-secessionists turned up this morning outside the headquarters of the national police force and applauded the officers for, they say, maintaining law and order. Tension still remains high on the streets of the city, \" she said.\n\nBarcelona's mayor Ada Colau, who does not support the secessionist movement, said her city \"does not deserve what we are living through\", noting that pavements had been torn up and hundreds of plastic rubbish bins torched in the unrest.\n\nBarcelona is Spain's second-largest city and draws millions of tourists each year. Three city roads remained closed on Saturday because of the damage, with some foreign visitors caught unawares by the chaos and shocked by what they saw.\n\n\"We got here and were like, 'Oh, God'. The street was on fire in front of the hostel,\" said Flynn Winstanley, 18, a winery worker from Margaret River in Australia.", "description": "Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Catalonia President Quim Torra must unequivocally condemn unrest before talks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/19/79789c770d4b4f239d5f793f74d4c421_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
