We have no issues with it whatsoever.\"\n\n'Not too impressed'\n\nSpeaking to The Australian Financial Review, Mr James said there was definitely a need for the type of research reports produced by JCap, saying it can be tough for many local analysts to be critical of companies because of conflicting interests within sell-side firms.\n\nHe also said he had pushed the company to provide more disclosure on its pricing model. Morningstar also uses a lower growth rate in its models than other analysts \u2013 a 13 per cent compound annual revenue growth (CAGR) and an EPS CAGR 18 per cent over the next decade.\n\nBut, he said there were too many aspects of the JCap report on WiseTech that were questionable and undermined its research, making it unconvincing and raising concerns that it was designed to bring the share price down without being based on facts.\n\n\"I'm not too impressed and I have some concerns that JCap's strategy is too long in the tooth and it's looking for stuff where there isn't much to find,\" he said.\n\n\"I've always been a big fan of this kind of research ... [but] a lot of arguments in the report are around the edges, which can have a big impact if the share price is extremely stressed to start with.\n\n\"JCap has probably made some good points, but they haven't come out with something groundbreaking or shown that WiseTech is a fraud.\"", "description": "Morningstar's Gareth James has the lowest target price on WiseTech of $8.10 of all the analysts on Bloomberg, but he did not find the JCap reports convincing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9051%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_197%2C$y_380/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1b27a331bc6421bc5e38ce353e6a2799ef413c90", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
