Investigates Possible Chemical Weapons Use by Turkish Forces in Syria", "language": "en", "text": "Smoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain as seen from the border town of Ceylanpinar, Turkey, October 15, 2019. (Stoyan Nenov/Reuters)\n\nUnited Nations chemical-weapons inspectors announced that they are investigating whether Turkish forces used chemical weapons in their invasion of Syria, the Guardian reported Friday.\n\nThe Kurds have accused Turkey of using white phosphorous during their recent incursion into northeastern Syria. The Kurdish Red Crescent claims that six patients, including civilians and military members, have been hospitalized in the city of Hasakah due to burns from \u201cunknown weapons.\u201d\n\nThe organization could not confirm chemical-weapons usage, saying it was \u201cworking together with our international partners to investigate this subject.\u201d However, a British chemical-weapons expert who examined a photo of one of the victims said the burns on the victim were likely from a chemical weapon.\n\n\u201cThe most likely culprit is white phosphorus,\u201d said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of Britain\u2019s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear regiment. \u201cIt is a horrific weapon, and has been used repeatedly during the Syrian civil war; unfortunately its use has become increasingly normalized.\u201d\n\nWhite phosphorous can be used legally as a smokescreen or as an incendiary at night to illuminate the battlefield, and is held by militaries worldwide. The use of white phosphorous as a weapon, however, is illegal under international law because it causes severe burns upon contact with skin.\n\nWhile some Kurdish officials alleged that Turkey used \u201cunconventional weapons\u201d in Syria, Turkey denies this.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact known by everyone that there are no chemical weapons in the inventory of the Turkish armed forces,\u201d said Turkish defense minister Hulusi Akar.\n\nTurkey invaded northeast Syria on October 9 to clear a \u201csafe zone\u201d in which to resettle 3.6 million Syrian refugees residing in Turkey, as well as to combat Kurdish groups in the region it considers terrorist organizations. Some of these Kurdish groups were instrumental in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS in Syria.\n\nSyrian president Bashar Assad has repeatedly used chemical weapons against Syrian citizens in that country\u2019s civil war.", "description": "The Kurds have accused Turkey of using white phosphorous during their recent incursion into northeastern Syria.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
