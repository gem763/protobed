Fink stepped in and passed for 351 yards with ample help from his outstanding receivers in USC\u2019s 30-23 win.\n\nFink is likely to lead the underdog Trojans against the defending Pac-12 champion Huskies (3-1, 0-1). Offensive coordinator Graham Harrell is working overtime to train his third starting quarterback in five games - and the non-quarterbacks who would be Fink\u2019s backup, including a walk-on safety and a starting receiver.\n\n\u201cWe plan on playing Fink,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cAnd if something happens, you\u2019re in a scramble situation and you\u2019ve got to make the best of what you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans (3-1, 2-0 Pac-12) installed a completely new Air Raid offense this season under Harrell, but have still managed a solid start despite upheaval at the scheme\u2019s most important position.\n\nJ.T. Daniels was lost to a season-ending knee injury right before halftime in USC\u2019s season opener, and 18-year-old freshman Slovis stepped in to start the next three games. He was outstanding in a victory over a ranked Stanford team, but threw three interceptions in an embarrassing overtime loss at BYU.\n\nFink realizes he could be playing for the permanent starting job if he performs well in Slovis\u2019 absence, but it\u2019s all tied to the Trojans\u2019 overall success.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a great opportunity, especially today,\u201d Fink said. \u201cAgain, it (stinks) to see anyone on the team get hurt, but that leaves more opportunity and more doors for myself, so I\u2019m going to go ahead and take that and run with it.\u201d\n\nFink will be USC\u2019s only scholarship quarterback at Washington if Slovis doesn\u2019t suit up. Jack Sears, who finished fourth in the four-man quarterback competition in training camp despite previous starting experience at USC, entered the transfer portal and hasn\u2019t returned to the team.\n\nFink nearly left the Trojans himself after spring football, entering the transfer portal and even taking a visit to Illinois. The Rancho Cucamonga native strongly considered a move to the Illini before returning to USC in June, citing a desire to stay close to home.\n\nWhen asked to choose the best part of his performance against Utah, he cited the chance to celebrate afterward with his family. Fink\u2019s father was at practice Tuesday to watch him running the first-team offense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal, (but) it\u2019s an amazing opportunity for me and the team to keep moving forward,\u201d Fink said.\n\nFink threw 18 passes in his first two seasons at USC as a backup to Sam Darnold and Daniels. He threw 30 more against the Utes, including one TD pass apiece to Tyler Vaughns, Michael Pittman Jr. and Amon-Ra St. Brown, his triumvirate of elite receivers.\n\nHelton and Harrell are getting creative to prepare backups for the potential disaster of Fink going down with an injury.\n\nBrandon Perdue, a walk-on junior who played quarterback sparingly in high school and junior college before moving to safety at USC, would be Fink\u2019s primary backup. He has been the quarterback of USC\u2019s scout team in practice, but hasn\u2019t thrown a competitive pass since some brief action for New Mexico Military Institute in 2017.\n\nHarrell even put Vaughns behind center during practice Tuesday night, simply because he wants to have options.\n\n\u201cTyler is a great athlete, and he can throw a football,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cSo we\u2019re giving him snaps. You\u2019ve got to be creative in this situation.\u201d\n\nStarting safety Talanoa Hufanga is in the concussion protocol as well, Helton said. The Trojans\u2019 leading tackler made a career-high 14 tackles against Utah in a breakout performance, but he also has a sprained shoulder.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Quarterback Kedon Slovis is in the concussion protocol for No. 21 Southern California, increasing the likelihood of Matt Fink making his first career start at No. 17 Washington this weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/utah_usc_football_02175_c0-167-3995-2496_s1770x1032.jpg?d343611a6eb4717bf9d10637f3ee02b9ea2dc6cf", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
