Indeed, while the foreign-born population of Italy accounts for 8.7 per cent of the population it is responsible for one in five crimes committed in the country, with some studies putting the figure as high as one in three.\n\nOn the trend of migrants moving to left-wing cities, a city administration insider told Italian newspaper Il Giornale that ample goodwill creates \u201copportunities for those who want to take advantage of it.\u201d", "description": "Italian cities controlled by mayors of the Italian left-wing party \u2018Partito Democratico\u2019 saw the largest amounts of criminal complaints.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/02/GettyImages-586899272-1-e1487090911100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
