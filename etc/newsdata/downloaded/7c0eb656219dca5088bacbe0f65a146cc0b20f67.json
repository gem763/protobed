John Kennedy (R-LA) on Thursday applauded 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke for being open and honest about his desire to confiscate millions of AR-15s.\n\n\"Look, there are two groups of people behind these bills,\" Kennedy told Fox News' Sandra Smith. \"There's a group of people who I think in good faith honestly believe that further curtailing our Second Amendment rights will enhance public safety,\" Kennedy said. \"But there's another group that just hates the Second Amendment, and I want to thank Congressman Beto O'Rourke for being honest \u2014 I mean, his honesty was refreshing.\"\n\n\"And by that, senator, you're referencing his doubling down on his controversial stance that he's willing to confiscate guns,\" Smith replied.\n\n\"I want to thank the Congressman for being honest because I don't agree with him,\" Kennedy aid. \"Beto's copy of the Bill of Rights goes from one to three. Mine includes the Second Amendment. But there are a whole host of people here in Washington, D.C. \u2014 not all of my Democratic friends, but many of my Democratic friends \u2014 they don\u2019t believe in the Second Amendment.\"\n\n\"They would be happy to confiscate America's guns,\" he explained. \"And if you don\u2019t believe that, then you probably also still believe in Big Foot. I mean, it's a fact and everybody up here knows it.\"\n\nFor years, gun control advocates have said they're not interested in confiscating our firearms. They always say, \"No one is coming for your guns. We just want common sense gun laws.\" Kennedy is right. Second Amendment-loving folks should be thanking people like Beto. He has confirmed what we knew to be a reality. He has come out and said exactly what he wants to happen. Democrats can no longer hide and say we're wearing tinfoil hats or that we're being paranoid. Beto has said what many in the Democratic Party want: a firearm registry and mandatory confiscation.", "description": "Admission time..09/20/2019 1:10:31AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/190/33348227-6f9c-4fb4-86bc-8d96ed60f645.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
