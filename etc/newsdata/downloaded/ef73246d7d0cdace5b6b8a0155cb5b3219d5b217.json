Bush.\n\nHe left the diplomatic service to become a consultant and in 2012 was named executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute, a center focused on national security named after senator John McCain.\n\nThe Trump administration in 2017 appointed Volker to take charge of US policy on Ukraine, in an unusual arrangement in which he was essentially a volunteer for the State Department while maintaining his university duties.\n\nThe State Press, the student-run publication at Arizona State University, quoted a university spokesperson as saying that Volker had quit his Ukraine position.\n\nThe Arizona Republic also quoted the university's president, Michael Crow, as confirming that Volker would stay at the institute but leave the State Department.\n\nThe State Department did not answer requests for comment.\n\nAs an envoy, Volker was tasked with overseeing critical US support to Ukraine as it faces a separatist insurgency backed by Russia.\n\nMore than 13,000 people have died since fighting broke out in 2014, when Russia also annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats are looking into whether Trump used a delay in a $400 million aid package for Ukraine as leverage to press for action on Biden.", "description": "US special representative on Ukraine Kurt Volker resigned Friday after Congress ordered him to answer questions in an impeachment investigation on President Donald Trump, a source said.
