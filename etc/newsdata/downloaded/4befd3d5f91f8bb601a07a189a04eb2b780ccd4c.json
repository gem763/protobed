The judges also concluded that the structure of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is unconstitutional because of job protections for the agency\u2019s director.\n\n\u201cCongress created FHFA amid a dire financial calamity, but expedience does not license omnipotence,\u201d a majority of judges on a 16-member panel said in Friday\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe ruling came a day after the Treasury Department unveiled its long-awaited plan to end more than a decade of federal control of Fannie and Freddie. The plan disappointed investors, in part because it lacked specifics on key details that would determine how to end the government\u2019s conservatorship of the companies. Shares of the companies fell the most since January after the report\u2019s release.\n\nFannie and Freddie don\u2019t make loans themselves. Instead, they keep the nation\u2019s mortgage market humming by buying mortgages from lenders and packaging them into bonds that are sold to investors with guarantees of interest and principal.\n\nThe companies were put into federal conservatorship in 2008 as the housing market cratered and were sustained by taxpayer aid. They have since returned to profitability and paid in $115 billion more in dividends to the Treasury than they received in bailout funds. Since 2013, nearly all of their profits have been sent to the Treasury under a policy called the \u201cnet-worth sweep.\u201d\n\nThe companies\u2019 shareholders, including hedge-fund luminaries such as John Paulson and Bill Ackman, have griped for years about the terms of conservatorship. Investors have sued regulators multiple times seeking to end the sweep and gain access to the Fannie and Freddie\u2019s profits. Those lawsuits have mostly been unsuccessful and this case, a full court review of a ruling of a three-judge panel, was seen as a last hope by many of the shareholders.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted that the court has made clear that the net worth sweep will not be allowed to stand,\u201d the shareholders\u2019 lawyer, David Thompson, said of Friday\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court last year declined to consider a case arising from a Washington appeals court decision that blocked another group of investors\u2019 attempt to sue the FHFA over its authority to impose the sweep.\n\nA U.S. Treasury Department spokesman referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which declined to comment. An FHFA spokeswoman didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe case is Collins v. Mnuchin, 17-20364, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans).\n\n(Updates with comment by lawyer for investors in eighth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Austin Weinstein in New York at aweinstein18@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jesse Westbrook at jwestbrook1@bloomberg.net, Peter Blumberg, Joe Schneider\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors won a big victory in their long battle to reap benefits from their stakes in the mortgage giants with a court ruling letting them pursue claims that the U.S. sweep of the companies\u2019 earnings is illegal.A panel of federal appeals court judges in New", "authors": ["Austin Weinstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
