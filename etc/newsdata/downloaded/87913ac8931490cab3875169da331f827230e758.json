It\u2019s complicated to play against a team who knew that if they lost they were pretty much out,\u201d said Spain captain Sergio Ramos, who broke Iker Casillas\u2019 national appearance record with his 168th cap.\n\n\u201cWe viewed this as an important match to win so as to qualify tonight but we approach the remaining games with calm and confidence.\u201d\n\nIt was Spain\u2019s first draw in a European Championship qualifier since a 1-1 stalemate at Iceland in September 2007, and ended their 100 percent record in the group.\n\nSpain started strongly and almost took the lead inside the first minute as home goalkeeper Rune Jarstein kept out Mikel Oyarzabal\u2019s effort.\n\nBut Norway, without injured teenage striker Erling Braut Haaland, grew into the contest and saw a penalty appeal turned down when Ramos tangled with King, before the Bournemouth forward headed Omar Elabdellaoui\u2019s \u2018rabona\u2019 cross too close to Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n\n\u2013 Saul strikes \u2013\n\nThe hosts were the better side for much of the first half, but Elabdellaoui wasted another opportunity when he dallied on the ball inside the Spain box before shooting straight at Kepa.\n\nCeltic centre-back Kristoffer Ajer also went close on the stroke of half-time, but headed wide when unmarked from a corner.\n\nBut Spain snatched a 47th-minute lead as Norway failed to clear their lines, and Saul Niguez latched onto Sergio Busquet\u2019s knockdown to unleash a dipping strike from just outside the area which bounced through the hands of Jarstein.\n\nThe Scandinavians came close to a leveller within seconds, but King\u2019s looping header dropped agonisingly wide.\n\nSpain almost doubled their advantage midway through the second period, as Napoli midfielder Fabian Ruiz\u2019s curling long-range strike clipped the crossbar.\n\nLars Lagerback\u2019s Norway, hoping to qualify for a first major tournament since Euro 2000, continued to pile forwards and Ole Selnaes was denied an equaliser by Saul\u2019s brilliant block, before King blazed over.\n\nRuiz struck the woodwork for a second time with a low effort which bounced off the base of the post, and Norway made him pay.\n\nElabdellaoui was flattened by the onrushing Kepa, and King, just as he did in Norway\u2019s 2-1 opening-game loss in Spain, slotted home the penalty.", "description": "Oslo (AFP) \u2013 Joshua King\u2019s 94th-minute penalty snatched Norway a 1-1 draw with Spain in Oslo on Saturday as the three-time champions were made", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/b558f5_king-scored-an-injury-time-penalty-norway-king-penalty-denies-spain-in-dramatic-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
