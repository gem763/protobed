This marks the second time a federal judge has ruled in favor of reinstating a journalist\u2019s press pass during the Trump administration.\n\nYou may remember the case of Playboy magazine reporter Brian Karem\u2019s dust-up with former Trump advisor Sebastian Gorka (current Salem Radio show host) in the White House Rose Garden. Karem, also a CNN political analyst, had his press credentials temporarily suspended due to bad behavior after a July 11 White House social media summit. A shouting match between Karem and Gorka, a guest that day, took place in the Rose Garden after Karem described the summit attendees as \u201cgroup of people that are eager for demonic possession.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that sort of comment offered up by a reporter covering the White House crosses the line of professional behavior. When the White House suspended his credentials, Karem said he would appeal the decision. The guy who likes to play a tough guy reporter suddenly milked victimhood for all he could.\n\nIt was not hard to be apathetic to Karem\u2019s suspension, to be honest. Perhaps you remember that time during a press briefing with former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders when Karem shouted his question to her \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t you have any empathy for what they go through?\u201d \u2013 because of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration law enforcement on the southern border. Reporters are entitled to ask whatever question they want but when it goes to a personal level, it\u2019s unprofessional and unacceptable. Emotional outbursts make the reporter the story, which apparently some of them want these days.\n\nU.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled in favor of Karem, calling the White House\u2019s decision an arbitrary one. While he issued a temporary restraining order and an injunction against the White House, it was only because he found White House guidelines on appropriate behavior were too vague. He didn\u2019t rule on Karem\u2019s claim of losing his right to free speech. The ruling is not a final ruling but Contreras thinks Karem will win his appeal.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment requires \u2018that individual newsmen not be arbitrarily excluded from sources of information,'\u201d Contreras wrote in his opinion, citing federal case law. \u201cHis First Amendment interest depends on his ability to freely pursue \u2018journalistically productive conversations with White House officials.\u2019 Yet without his hard pass, he lacks access to pursue those conversations \u2014 even as an eavesdropper.\u201d In issuing a temporary restraining order and injunction against the White House, Contreras said that the White House\u2019s guidelines for appropriate behavior were insufficient and vague. Contreras\u2019 decision, although not yet a final ruling, signaled that he believed Karem ultimately would prevail. \u201cWhite House events appear to vary greatly in character,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that \u201cwithout any contextual guideposts, \u2018professionalism,\u2019 standing alone, remains too murky to provide fair notice here. \u2026 \u201cKarem has provided some evidence that White House press events are often freewheeling and that aggressive conduct has long been tolerated without punishment.\u201d The judge clarified that \u201cIn granting Karem relief, the Court finds only that the White House likely did not provide the requisite guidance in this specific case \u2014 nothing more. And, as noted earlier, the Court does not reach Karem\u2019s independent free speech claim.\u201d Nevertheless, the judge concluded: \u201cKarem has shown that even the temporary suspension of his pass inflicts irreparable harm on his First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s pretty sad when a journalist has to be told what is and isn\u2019t professional behavior, especially in such a top job as covering the White House. The dust-up in the Rose Garden was more of the same grandstanding for cameras. His antics give him an opportunity to appear on CNN. That seems to be more important than actually reporting on the events he\u2019s sent to cover.\n\nThe judge wrote that when Karem told Gorka that they could \u2018go outside and have a long conversation,\u2019 it was a joke, not an actual threat of physical violence.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham pushed back on the judge\u2019s ruling, as you would expect to happen. She was the one to make the decision to suspend Karem\u2019s credentials.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the decision of the district court to issue an injunction that essentially gives free rein to members of the press to engage in unprofessional, disruptive conduct at the White House,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cMr. Karem\u2019s conduct, including threatening to escalate a verbal confrontation into a physical one to the point that a Secret Service agent intervened, clearly breached well-understood norms of professional conduct. The Press Secretary must have the ability to deter such unacceptable conduct.\u201d\n\nThe President of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association voiced approval of the judge\u2019s ruling while calling for professionalism from journalists.\n\nWhite House Correspondents\u2019 Association (WHCA) President Jonathan Karl, ABC News\u2019 chief White House correspondent, said: \u201cThe WHCA is gratified the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia acted to uphold the due process rights of one of our members. The WHCA will continue to advocate for the rights of our members and against actions by the government that would have a chilling effect on journalism protected by the First Amendment. As we have said repeatedly, we believe everyone should conduct themselves professionally at the White House.\u201d\n\nAs to Karem\u2019s cries of victimhood, those don\u2019t wash at all. His credentials weren\u2019t yanked for several weeks after the altercation in the Rose Garden and he was given notice, with the opportunity to object. It\u2019s not like he was disciplined out of the blue. The judge said Karem was able to provide evidence by being allowed to remain on the White House grounds during that period of time. That is why the judge issued the restraining order \u2013 he thinks the White House is able to wait to enforce sanctions against Karem until the court proceedings conclude.\n\nNow we wait for the final, formal ruling. I\u2019m not a lawyer but if I had to guess, I\u2019d say he gets his full credentials back with maybe a slap on the wrist. Perhaps the White House press secretary can issue more concise, clear guidelines to those who don\u2019t understand what the term \u201cprofessionalism\u201d means.", "description": "White House pushes back", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/0b400ea6-8f79-4d36-a1a2-10fe8cb4f2c8.jpg"}
