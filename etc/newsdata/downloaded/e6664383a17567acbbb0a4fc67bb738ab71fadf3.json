There were no reports of damage to Japanese vessels or aircraft traveling in the area, he said.\n\nThe launches, which were the North\u2019s ninth round of weapons tests since late July, came hours after a senior North Korean diplomat on Tuesday evening announced that North Korea and the United States have agreed to resume working-level nuclear negotiations this weekend.\n\nAfter supervising a testing firing of what the North described as a \u201cnewly developed super-large multiple rocket launcher\u201d last month, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was quoted by state media as saying that the system would require a \u201crunning fire test\u201d to complete its development.\n\nNorth Korea could also be demonstrating its displeasure over South Korea displaying some of its newly purchased U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter jets for the first time during its Armed Forces Day ceremony on Tuesday. The North has sharply reacted to the F-35 purchases, calling them a grave provocation that violate recent inter-Korean agreements aimed at lowering military tensions.\n\nNuclear negotiations have been at a standstill for months following a February summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam. Those talks broke down after the U.S. rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for partially surrendering its nuclear capabilities.\n\nNorth Korea followed the summit with belligerent rhetoric and conducted a slew of short-range weapons tests in recent weeks that were widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage ahead of a possible resumption of negotiations.\n\nIn a statement released through state media, Choe Son Hui, North Korea\u2019s first vice minister of foreign affairs, said the two nations will have preliminary contact on Friday before holding working-level talks on Saturday. She expressed optimism over the outcome of the meeting but did not say where it would take place.\n\n\u201cIt is my expectation that the working-level negotiations would accelerate the positive development of the DPRK-U.S. relations,\u201d Choe said in the statement, using an abbreviation for North Korea\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nThe U.S. confirmed the talks.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that U.S. and DPRK officials plan to meet within the next week. I do not have further details to share on the meeting,\u201d said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who is traveling with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Rome.\n\nChoe\u2019s announcement came after North Korea praised Trump last month for suggesting that Washington may pursue an unspecified \u201cnew method\u201d in nuclear negotiations with the North. North Korea also has welcomed Trump\u2019s decision to fire hawkish former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who advocated a \u201cLibya model\u201d of unilateral denuclearization as a template for North Korea.\n\nThe 2004 disarmament of Libya is seen by North Korea as a deeply provocative comparison because Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed following U.S.-supported military action in his country seven years after giving up a rudimentary nuclear program that was far less advanced than North Korea\u2019s.\n\nThe office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who lobbied hard to set up the first summit between Kim and Trump last year in Singapore, welcomed Choe\u2019s announcement and expressed hope that the resumed talks would result in \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in denuclearization and stabilization of peace.\n\nThat could be a tall order. In the high-stakes diplomacy between Trump and Kim, which has been driven chiefly by the personalities of the leaders rather than an established diplomatic process, working-level meetings have been useful for fleshing out the logistics of summits but unproductive in hammering out the details of a nuclear deal that has eluded the countries for decades.\n\nThe stalemate of past months has revealed fundamental differences between the two sides. North Korea says it will never unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons and missiles and insists that U.S.-led sanctions against it should be lifted first before any progress in negotiations.\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to maintain robust economic pressure until North Korea takes real steps toward fully and verifiably relinquishing its nuclear program.\n\nThere are doubts about whether Kim would ever voluntarily deal away an arsenal that he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nAfter their Singapore summit in June 2018, Trump and Kim issued a vague statement calling for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing how or when it would occur.\n\nThe lack of substance and fruitless working-level talks set up the failure in Hanoi, which the Americans blamed on what they said were excessive North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility in Yongbyon. Trump and Kim met for the third time at the inter-Korean border on June 30 and agreed that working-level talks between the countries should resume.", "description": "North Korea on Wednesday fired projectiles toward its eastern sea, South Korea\u2019s military said, in an apparent display of its expanding military capabilities...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GH048_nkorea_ZG_20180409200054.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
