In 2017, more than 1.1billion were dispensed \u2013 an increase of 1.7million since 2016.\n\nAt the same time, every country wants the cheapest drugs. This has driven the manufacturing price of generic drugs (those on which patents have expired) down to less than one pound for a single vial or blister pack. Such generics comprise about 85 per cent of drugs prescribed on the NHS.\n\nSome 84 per cent of the 402 pharmacy workers surveyed by the Chemist and Druggist website said they have experienced shortages of HRT in the past six months. Stocking raw materials has been a growing issue in the industry and suppliers have encountered difficulties making the glue used in HRT patches (file picture)\n\nAs a result, profits are so low that it only makes sense for one or two global manufacturers to make these drugs, and benefit from economies of scale.\n\nThis means when something goes wrong in their factories \u2013 often located in Asia \u2013 the whole world\u2019s supply is thrown into crisis.\n\nIn 2017, an explosion at a Chinese factory that made the antibiotic piperacillin-tazobactam left only one other manufacturer worldwide.\n\nIncreasingly stringent safety rules are placing further stress on drug supplies. Inspections by the European Medicines Agency resulted in the partial suspension of a Bristol Laboratories manufacturing site in Luton two years ago as it did not \u2018comply with good manufacturing practice\u2019. The firm, which produces up to nine billion tablets a year, only had its licence to operate fully restored in June.\n\nEighty-four per cent of the 402 pharmacy workers surveyed were low on HRT (pictured are HRT pills). And a survey in November by the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists found that Germany, Denmark, France, Belgium and Ireland are all suffering similar shortages to the UK (file image)\n\nMeridian Medical Technologies \u2013 which makes the EpiPen (pictured) for severe allergic reactions \u2013 suffered manufacturing issues that limited supplies last year\n\nSupply is further imperilled by the fact that the cheapest way of making a single drug is to split various processes \u2013 such as blending and filtering chemicals \u2013 between factories in different countries. A problem with a single site can halt the entire process.\n\nShortages of raw materials are also a factor. Chinese suppliers have encountered difficulties making the glue used in HRT patches, while Meridian Medical Technologies \u2013 which makes the EpiPen for severe allergic reactions \u2013 suffered manufacturing snags that limited supplies last year. Such problems can cause wider knock-on effects, too. When one brand or formulation of drug disappears from chemists\u2019 shelves, demand for similar medications spirals beyond suppliers\u2019 ability to cope.\n\nThese crises are not unique to Britain. A survey in November by the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists found that Germany, Denmark, France, Belgium and Ireland are all suffering similar shortages.\n\nThe number of medicines in short supply in America has increased by half, to more than 280, over the past three years. Last year the American Medical Association urged its government to classify the problem as a \u2018national security issue\u2019, which would permit \u2018incentivisation\u2019 to set up factories in the US.\n\nA poll poll of community pharmacists has revealed shortages for every major type of medicine \u2013 including painkillers, contraceptives and diabetes pills\n\nFrench authorities have called for an EU-wide strategy to bring drug-manufacturing back to the continent.\n\nOf course, scarce supply brings with it the peril of profiteering. Last year, the National Audit Office revealed shocking price hikes charged by UK wholesale suppliers. Some had risen by more than 7,000 per cent in two years.\n\nThe NAO found \u2018a direct relationship\u2019 between the price increases and medicine shortages \u2013 and it would seem that some wholesalers are gaming the market. According to some pharmacists, shortages of specific drugs can disappear as soon as the NHS has agreed to pay the wholesalers\u2019 suddenly-hiked price. Kevin Western, a community pharmacist in Essex, says the drug industry has \u2018a long, well established, record of withholding stock to maintain or boost prices\u2019.\n\nInternational profiteering called \u2018parallel trading\u2019 \u2013 when wholesalers can get a higher price for a drug in another country and so sell their supply there \u2013 is adding to the crisis. Belgium, Poland and Slovakia have recently introduced new laws to try to limit this.\n\nGiven the current situation, perhaps it is time Britain followed suit.", "description": "Mass shortages of prescription medicines is caused by stock-piling, stringent safety rules have led to closures of laboratories and shortages of raw materials have had knock-on effect.", "authors": ["John Naish For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/23/19176104-0-image-a-21_1570056912400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
