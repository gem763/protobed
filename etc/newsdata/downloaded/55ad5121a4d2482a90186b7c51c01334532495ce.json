Meanwhile, the account remains active on both Facebook and Twitter, posting content as-normal while railing against the Instagram ban.\n\nBullying or Harrassment? You decide.

Which, is kinda understandable to delete. pic.twitter.com/aiKygBsV1d \u2014 B Cardi (@browncardigan69) September 12, 2019\n\nThe majority of the posts that seem to be at the core of the deletion were reported for contravening Instagram's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, although Brown Cardigan does not post any footage without permission from the owner and not without full attribution as well.\n\nInterestingly enough, similar Instagram account Pink Mitsubishis is seemingly also feeling the Wrath of Zuckerberg at the moment, noting in a caption that they're unable to keep posts up for any longer than an hour at present. The previously-active account has just six posts from the past 13 weeks still live on their feed.\n\nWhether this represents a much stricter shift in Instagram moderation policy or a dedicated push to evict harder-edge meme content from the platform altogether remains a complete mystery. But for now, Brown Cardigan is dead.
