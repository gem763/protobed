Elizabeth Warren\u2019s ascent to front-runner status in the Democratic presidential polls, it was everywhere apparent at Tuesday night\u2019s debate, where her rivals came after her with guns a-blazing.\n\nIn previous debates, Warren had dodged the question of whether middle-class taxes would go up in order to pay for Medicare-for-All and received minimal pushback.\n\nMore news: Here\u2019s what the Democrats said about health care during the debate\n\nHer standard response \u2014 \u201cCosts will go down for hard-working middle-class families\u201d \u2014 which isn\u2019t an answer to the question posed, pretty much went unchallenged.\n\nTuesday night, her fellow Democrats would have none of it. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said that most Americans will save money on health-care bills, but \u201ctaxes will go up.\u201d\n\nHe should know because he \u201cwrote the damn bill!\u201d\n\nAlso read: Democrats spar over guaranteed jobs, universal basic income and $15 minimum wage\n\nOthers chimed in to criticize Warren\u2019s evasiveness.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \u201cWe owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019ll send the invoice.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph Biden confirmed that higher taxes would be required to cover Medicare-for-All\u2019s estimated cost of $30 trillion over 10 years.\n\nIf Warren is convinced that Medicare-for-All is the best option for providing universal health care to all Americans, she should be up front about the source of the revenue needed to pay for it. That she bobs and weaves around the question is about as close as it gets to an admission that middle-class taxes will have to go up.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates pretty much laid off Joe Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s affiliation with Ukraine energy company Burisma at Tuesday\u2019s debate. They seem willing to leave that potentially damaging affiliation \u2014 even if it\u2019s only the optics when his father was vice president and in charge of addressing corruption in Ukraine \u2014 to President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s Twitter finger has a much broader reach than the TV debate audience.\n\nShould Warren become the Democratic nominee, her fellow Democrats\u2019 critiques of her free-for-all plans and questionable financing will provide serious fodder for Trump, which should prove more substantive that the derogatory name-calling he prefers in an effort to damage his challengers.\n\nKlobuchar, who along with other candidates favors a public option for health care without kicking 149 million people off their private insurance, had other issues with Warren\u2019s plans for health care and taxes.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipedream is something that you can actually get done,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\nThen there was the widespread opposition to Warren\u2019s proposal for imposing a wealth tax of 2% on all assets above $50 million.\n\nAccording to Warren, that revenue could be used to provide free universal child care and tuition-free college, cancel student loan debt for 95% of those who are carrying it, and fund programs for the poorest Americans, among other initiatives.\n\nAside from the fact that a wealth tax may not be constitutional \u2014 the introduction of the income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment \u2014 there are lots of reasons to doubt its effectiveness and ability to pay for all of Warren\u2019s promises.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang summed them up well, telling the audience that a wealth tax, which makes \u201ca lot of sense in principle,\u201d had been tried and rejected in an array of developed countries because it had \u201cmassive implementation problems and did not generate the [projected] revenue.\u201d\n\nWarren also equated opposition to a wealth tax to a desire to protect billionaires: a notion that did not sit well with Biden, Klobuchar, Yang and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.\n\nOnce again, Klobuchar hit back with a pointed critique.\n\n\u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d she said, referring to hedge-fund-manager-turned-environmentalist Tom Steyer. \u201cWe just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nZing!\n\nWarren may have garnered the most speaking time at the debate, but time doesn\u2019t equate with electability. She was on the defensive much of the time, which supports the notion that her Democratic rivals view her as their No. 1 challenge and attacking her plans as their No. 1 priority.\n\nAnd if her progressive policies are under attack from more moderate candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president, one has to wonder how Warren will fare in a one-on-one match-up with Trump in 2020.", "description": "If Elizabeth Warren is convinced that Medicare-for-All is the best option for providing universal health care to all Americans, she should be up front about...", "authors": ["Caroline Baum"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT495_warren_ZG_20191017091440.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
