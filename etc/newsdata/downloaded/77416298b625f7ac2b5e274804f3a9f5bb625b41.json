The construction of Zalu dam will be prioritised to relieve the current water challenges,\" Sisulu said.\n\nSisulu said the interventions were in line with the government\u2019s New District Model of aligning integrated service delivery across the three spheres of government, within the next 18 months.\n\nAccording to the department, their scientific research has pointed to a rain scarce summer up to mid-December. The below-average rainfall predicted would be accompanied by hot temperatures, thereby raising evaporation levels.\n\nREAD: Laudium in 'crisis' after three days without water\n\nAdditional water supply\n\nThe department has also sourced funds through its Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant (RBIG) to facilitate the bulk supply of water and equipment for boreholes in Qwaqwa, Free State.\n\nThe area is facing water challenges after the dam levels at Fika Patso plummeted to 10%. Currently, local communities rely on water from boreholes, while additional water supply projects are being constructed.\n\nOther areas that are affected by water scarcity and that have been identified for intervention are Butterworth, Lusikisiki, Port Alfred and Alfred Nzo in the Eastern Cape; as well as Aggeneys in the Namakwa District of the Northern Cape.\n\nIn Limpopo, the areas include Tzaneen, Mogalakwena, Modimolle, Bela Bela, Thabazimbi and Polokwane.", "description": "Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has directed her department to fast track interventions in areas across the country where dam levels have dropped significantly.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8481/9de235cdd8334976b0d75856d5f18bf0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
