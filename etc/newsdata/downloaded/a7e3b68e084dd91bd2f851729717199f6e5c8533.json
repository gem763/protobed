Assumptions made by providers using the information fed by a comparison website can substantially inflate the premiums offered to drivers, found a new investigation by the consumer organisation. Which? said the issue lay with how information is collected from motorists for quotes, especially when using comparison website. Drivers are asked a single set of questions agreed by the insurers on the panel rather than answering each insurer\u2019s unique set of application questions. This can lead to insurers gathering slightly different information about individuals to base their prices on than they would otherwise if the user had gone to them directly and answered the provider's specific set of questions. Which? believes that insurers need to be more transparent in how they determine the quotes they generate for consumers, and that insurers should be able to explain to drivers the factors that have influenced their premium. Those comparing car insurance online should make sure that all their details are accurate, check their quotes carefully and also get quotes from insurers that don't appear on comparison sites, such as Aviva and Direct Line. Ideally, people should run quotes through more than one comparison site, with our Ten tips for cheaper car insurance guide recommending trying Compare the Market, MoneySupermarket and Confused.com.\n\nCompare the Market says it aims to tackle the issue of motorists forgetting their insurance renewal date by introducing a new tool which will remind customers when their policy is coming to an end.\n\nThe new feature, which is accessed through the website's new tech-enabled AutoSergei service that aims to find consumers better deals, will tell drivers when their car insurance policy is coming to an end and will automatically retrieve their estimated renewal price from some of Compare the Market's panel of partners.\n\nCustomers will need to complete a new quote to sign up to the service, which will send them an annual alert about potential savings available 28 days before their policy expires.\n\nThey will then be given the opportunity to review their information before being provided with their quote results and the choice to switch to an alternative, and potentially cheaper car insurance product.\n\nIts research has revealed the best time to switch is 24 days before a policy ends.", "description": "Some 16 per cent of motorists - equivalent to over six million people nationwide - admitted that they don't remember to change car insurance providers when their policy comes to an end.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
