Now it\u2019s here and even sexier than expected. Arguably, the drop-top \u2018Vette cuts a more seductive silhouette than its coupe counterpart, but the more alluring variant achieves its extra airiness with virtually no compromises.\n\nTypically, convertibles offer less cargo space than their coupe siblings, but the mid-engine Corvette bucks that trend. Even with the top down, every cubic foot of space in the coupe is accounted for in the convertible, which means you can stow two sets of golf clubs in the trunk. If your golf outing happens to be a getaway, there is also room for a piece of carry-on luggage, along with a laptop bag.\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\nThe lack of compromise continues with the folding roof itself, which is now comprised of hard panels rather than the fabric of previous Corvette generations. The result is a tranquil interior. With the DJ\u2019s blaring tunes filtering through a chatty crowd at the 2020 Corvette convertible\u2019s launch event in Marina del Rey, Calif., the drop-top made effortless work of attenuating the outside world with a simple switch-flick. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how that closed-cabin serenity translates while cruising on the open road. A power rear window in the tonneau cover should do a good job of keeping wind noise at bay with the top down.\n\nNot only is the convertible\u2019s cargo capacity the same as the coupe\u2018s, but so are its power figures. Under the vented tonneau sits a 6.2-liter V-8 engine good for 490 hp and 465 ft lbs of torque. The available performance exhaust bumps both those figures up by five. Power is sent to the rear wheels via an eight-speed, dual-clutch transmission.\n\nAlong with the clich\u00e9 that the 2020 Corvette Stingray convertible looks fast standing still, it certainly looks striking while seated inside. Corvettes used to be derided for their cheap interiors. The C5 generation\u2019s cabin (1997 to 2004) was aptly described as \u201cStar Trek by Fisher-Price.\u201d Two generations later, Corvette finally got its act together by offering interior quality befitting a sports car priced in the mid-$50,000 range, but the C8 exceeds expectations with its interior, even when viewed from the outside.\n\n\u201cWe would actually hold design reviews\u2014what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re standing at the front of the car looking at it,\u201d says Tristan Murphy, lead interior designer for the C8 Corvette. Murphy says the ultimate goal of this outside perspective is to get the passerby to say, \u201cAh dude, I gotta sit in this thing. It looks crazy even from this view.\u201d\n\nChevrolet says the mid-engine Corvette Stingray convertible will hit dealerships near the end of the first quarter of 2020 with a starting price of $67,495, or $7,500 dearer than the Corvette Stingray coupe.\n\nSign up for Robb Report's Newsletter.
