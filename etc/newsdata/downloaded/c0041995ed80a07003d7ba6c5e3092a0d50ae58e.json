U.S. officials aren't sure how he knows that.", "language": "en", "text": "While announcing the killing of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, President Trump described the terrorist\u2019s death during the U.S. raid in unusually graphic detail \u2014 repeatedly claiming that al-Baghdadi died \u201cwhimpering, screaming and crying.\u201d But a top U.S. official who watched the raid with Trump in the White House Situation Room said he\u2019s not sure where the president got that information.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the source of that was,\u201d Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon Monday.\n\nTrump announced al-Baghdadi\u2019s death in a televised statement from the White House on Sunday morning, a day after U.S. forces carried out the operation in Syria.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\n\n\u201cThe thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread,\u201d the president added.\n\nPresident Trump and Gen.

Milley said the animal is recovering and will return to duty with its handler.\n\nTrump told reporters that he watched the raid from the Situation Room as it was carried out in real time with Milley, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Vice President Mike Pence, among others. The White House later released an official photo of the president and the top defense officials taken in the Situation Room.\n\n\u201cIt was something really amazing to see,\u201d the president said, adding that it was \u201cas though you were watching a movie.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the Situation Room had live overhead surveillance footage of the operation. But the feeds did not have audio, nor did they show what was happening in the underground tunnel where al-Baghdadi was killed.\n\nAppearing on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Esper said he wasn\u2019t sure where Trump got \u201cwhimpering\u201d from, either.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have those details,\u201d Esper said, adding that the president \u201cprobably had the opportunity to talk to the commanders on the ground.\u201d\n\nAfter announcing al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, Trump said it was important to describe his last moments in vivid terms so as to deter would-be ISIS fighters.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I think it\u2019s something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries, including the United States, they should see how he died,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t die a hero. He died a coward \u2014 crying, whimpering, screaming.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more coverage from Yahoo News:", "description": "Gen.
