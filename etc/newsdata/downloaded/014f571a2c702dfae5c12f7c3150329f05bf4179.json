Because there\u2019s no other option than documentary evidence. His constant deception is pushing us towards new and dangerous territory.\u201d\n\nTrump himself told reporters Tuesday afternoon that the impeachment push is \u201cjust a continuation of the witch hunt,\u201d and claimed it would actually help his reelection. \u201cThey say it\u2019s a positive for me,\u201d he said following a meeting with Iraqi President Barham Ahmed Salih at the United Nations in New York.\n\nHow Trump and the White House try to explain the Ukraine episode may matter to congressional investigators, but may not matter much to the general public. A recent CNN poll found that only 28 percent of Americans believe all or most of the information coming from the White House.\n\nTrump had appeared to survive the threat of impeachment when Democrats failed to use the release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report to respond forcefully. That document detailed Trump\u2019s solicitation and acceptance of help from Russia in his 2016 election, and pointed to 10 specific instances where Trump had worked to obstruct that probe.\n\nThe new push, though, is based on his attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, who Trump and his allies believe would be his strongest opponent if he were to win the Democratic presidential nomination next year. The overtures to Ukraine began with efforts by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to speak with Ukrainian officials, including a meeting in Madrid.\n\nIn July, Trump put a hold on nearly $400 million in aid, including military hardware, to Ukraine. On July 25 he spoke with Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, by phone from the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s subsequent descriptions of what happened during and around that phone call have varied with the date and time of day he has been asked.\n\nOn Friday, in the Oval Office, Trump refused to say what he\u2019d discussed, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower. I just hear it\u2019s a partisan person, meaning it comes out from another party. But I don\u2019t have any idea. But I can say it was a totally appropriate conversation. It was actually a beautiful conversation.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday morning, leaving the White House, Trump told reporters that he had not withheld the aid, but admitted the call concerned Biden: \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory. It was largely corruption \u2015 all of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nOn Monday afternoon, he said of Zelensky: \u201cHe gets elected on the basis of ending corruption in Ukraine. Well, I think that\u2019s good, and that\u2019s what I want to see. But when Biden does a thing like that, then there\u2019s still corruption, and that\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Trump said that he had, in fact, withheld money, but only because other European countries weren\u2019t paying enough: \u201cMy complaint has always been, and I\u2019d withhold again and I\u2019ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they\u2019re not doing it.\u201d\n\nThe contents of that phone call would likely have remained secret, had it not been for an intelligence community official who filed a complaint under a whistleblower law. The inspector general, a Trump appointee, found the complaint to be both credible and \u201curgent,\u201d but the White House blocked him from turning it over to relevant committees in Congress, even though the law requires it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) publicized the failure to turn over that complaint that news reports began emerging about Trump\u2019s apparent attempts to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden.\n\n\u201cThis raises serious concerns about whether White House, Department of Justice or other executive branch officials are trying to prevent a legitimate whistleblower complaint from reaching its intended recipient, the Congress, in order to cover up serious misconduct,\u201d Schiff said on Sept. 13.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, on Tuesday continued arguing that it does not consider the complaint to be covered under the whistleblower statute. Executive branch employees are not permitted to file such complaints based on a president\u2019s conversation, said one White House official on condition of anonymity.\n\nThat refusal, though, was cited by a number of previously impeachment-skeptical Democratic House members from districts Trump won as a reason they changed their minds.\n\n\u201cThis flagrant disregard for the law cannot stand,\u201d seven first-term Democrats wrote in an op-ed published in The Washington Post late Monday. \u201cIf these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?
