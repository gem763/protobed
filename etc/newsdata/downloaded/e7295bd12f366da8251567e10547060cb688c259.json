In June, CHS held more than 20 percent of all migrant children in government custody. And even as the number of children has declined, the company\u2019s government funding for their care has continued to flow. That\u2019s partly because CHS is still staffing a large Florida facility with 2,000 workers even though the last children left in August.\n\nTrump administration officials say CHS is keeping the Florida shelter on standby in case they need to quickly provide beds for more migrant teens, and that they\u2019re focused on the quality of care contractors can provide, not about who profits from the work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that sits with me morally as a problem,\u201d said Jonathan Hayes, director of the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting any additional money other than the normal grant or contract that would be received. We\u2019re not paying them more just because they\u2019re for profit.\u201d\n\nHHS\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement runs migrant children programs by funding 46 organizations that operate more than 165 shelters and foster programs for more than 67,000 migrant children who came to the U.S. on their own or were separated from parents or caregivers at the border this budget year.\n\nOverall, the federal government spent a record $3.5 billion caring for migrant children over the past two years to run its shelters through both contracts and grants.\n\nDuring that time, CHS swiftly moved into the business of caring for migrant children, an AP analysis of federal data found. In 2015, the company was paid $1.3 million in contracts to shelter migrant children, and so far this year the company has received almost $300 million in contracts to care for migrant kids, according to publicly available data. The company also operates some shelters under government grants.\n\nTRUMP DENIES REPORT ABOUT WANTING MOAT WITH ALLIGATORS AND SNAKES AT BORDER: 'THE PRESS HAS GONE CRAZY'\n\nFormer White House chief of staff John Kelly joined Caliburn\u2019s board this spring after stepping down from decades of government service. He earlier had served as homeland secretary, where he backed the idea of taking children from their parents at the border, saying it would discourage people from trying to immigrate or seek asylum.\n\nCritics say this means Kelly now stands to financially benefit from a policy he helped create.\n\nIn a statement, Caliburn\u2019s president, Jim Van Dusen, said: \u201cWith four decades of military and humanitarian leadership, in-depth understanding of international affairs and knowledge of current economic drivers around the world, General Kelly is a strong strategic addition to our team.\u201d\n\nToday CHS is operating six facilities including three \u201ctender age\u201d shelters in the Rio Grande Valley that can house the youngest, infants and toddlers. And CHS has plans underway to run a 500-bed shelter in El Paso, Texas, the company said.\n\nUnder Trump, the numbers of detained children grew in part due to new, strict requirements to screen every adult in a potential home, which significantly slowed reunifications until the policy ended late last year.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t disclose the names of individual shelters, nor how many children are in each one. But confidential government data obtained by AP shows that in June nearly one in four migrant children in government care was housed by CHS. That included more than 2,300 teens at Homestead and more than 500 kids in shelters in Brownsville, Los Fresnos and San Benito, Texas. For each teen held at Homestead at that time, it cost taxpayers an average $775 per day.\n\nAt the time, a total of 13,066 migrant children were being held in federally funded shelters. Those numbers have dropped sharply over the summer. By early October, HHS said there were 5,100 children in their care.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Sheltering migrant children has become a growing business for the Florida-based government contractor, as the number of minors in government custody has swollen to record levels over the past two years.
