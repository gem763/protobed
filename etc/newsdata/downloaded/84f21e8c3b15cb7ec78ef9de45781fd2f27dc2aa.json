You cannot function effectively,\u201d Yousef al-Horr, founder of the Gulf Organisation for Research and Development, told The Washington Post.\n\nIn rapidly growing urban areas throughout the Middle East, some predict cities could become uninhabitable, said Mohammed Ayoub, senior research director at the Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about 4 to 6 degrees Celsius increase in an area that already experiences high temperatures,\u201d Mr Ayoub said.\n\nThe danger is acute because of the humidity. When humidity is very high, evaporation from the skin slows or stops.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

And in a heatwave in July 2010, temperatures hit an all-time high of 50.4C.\n\nIn the Souq Waqif market, housing shops, restaurants and small hotels, 3ft air-conditioning units blow cool air onto customers.\n\nA German television report alleged hundreds of deaths among foreign workers in Qatar in recent years, prompting new limits on outdoor work.\n\nThe government has said the World Cup will be carbon-neutral, and recently unveiled plans to plant a million trees, an idea at least one expert has condemned as \u201cunrealistic\u201d.\n\nFears that visiting football fans might wilt or even die prompted the decision to delay the World Cup in Qatar by five months.\n\nAt the new Al Janoub open-air stadium, grates built underneath the 40,000 seats expel cool air. Since cool air sinks, waves of it roll down to the pitch. More vents also feed cold air onto it directly.\n\nLast month, when Doha hosted the 2019 World Athletics Championships, it moved the women\u2019s marathon to midnight and water stations handed out sponges dipped in ice-cold water.\n\nFirst-aid responders outnumbered contestants. Some competitors had to be taken off in wheelchairs.\n\n\u201cWith the coming global environmental collapse, to live completely indoors is like, the only way we\u2019ll be able to survive,\" Qatari American artist Sophia al-Maria said in an interview in Dazed Digital. \"The Gulf\u2019s a prophecy of what\u2019s to come.\"\n\nZeke Hausfather, a climate data scientist, added: \u201cQatar is one of the fastest warming areas of the world, at least outside of the Arctic. Changes there can help give us a sense of what the rest of the world can expect if we do not take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d", "description": "Temperatures in Qatar \u2013 one of the hottest places on Earth \u2013 have risen so much that authorities have installed air conditioning in the open air including in streets and outdoor markets.
