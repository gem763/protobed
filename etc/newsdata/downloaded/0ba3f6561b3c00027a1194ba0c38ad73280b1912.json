And in The Great British Bake Off (C4) tent, the heat was getting to people.\n\nAlice was brandishing an electric fan like it was her oxygen mask. Henry was wiping rivers of sweat from his face and Steph wrapped a soaking wet tea-towel around her head, like Hilda Ogden having a nervous breakdown.\n\nPresenters Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding seemed to be succumbing to heat stroke, too.\n\nIt probably all made sense at the time, but we were left with the impression that, after eight weeks, the show reached its quarter-final stage in a state of near-hysteria. The mood swings were affecting the bakers, too\n\nTheir opening skits and links have been growing ever more surreal this series, but now they veered into outright delirium.\n\nAt the start of the show, Noel pretended to find 4ft 11in Sandi asleep in the cutlery drawer.\n\nLater, they both wore pink oven mitts for a game they called lobster arm-wrestling.\n\nThen Noel donned a headdress that looked like a boiled crab.\n\nPerhaps all these are symptoms of a show that been running too long this year. By now, we ought to have reached the final, but there are two more episodes to go\n\nIt probably all made sense at the time, but we were left with the impression that, after eight weeks, the show reached its quarter-final stage in a state of near-hysteria.\n\nThe mood swings were affecting the bakers, too.\n\nPicking up the recipe for the technical challenge, a Moroccan pie made with flaky warqa pastry, 20-year-old university student Henry swaggered: \u2018If anyone has heard of this, I will get naked \u2014 I\u2019m that confident.\u2019\n\nAt the other end of the emotional scale, Steph was in tears because she thought her warqa pie wouldn\u2019t cook in time.\n\nIn the end, she did better than Henry, who kept his clothes on even when he realised that some of the others did actually know what they were doing.\n\nPerhaps all these are symptoms of a show that been running too long this year.\n\nBy now, we ought to have reached the final, but there are two more episodes to go. It began with more contestants than ever \u2014 remember Dan? And Amelia? Of course you don\u2019t: they left weeks ago.\n\nPicking up the recipe for the technical challenge, a Moroccan pie made with flaky warqa pastry, 20-year-old university student Henry swaggered: \u2018If anyone has heard of this, I will get naked \u2014 I\u2019m that confident'\n\nDublin Murders (BBC1) will need a very long run if viewers are ever going to work out what the pickled heck is going on.\n\nThe first episode was confusing enough \u2014 why was detective Cassie Maddox (Sarah Greene) interrogating her partner Rob (Killian Scott) so tearfully in the creepy archives dungeon in that opening scene?\n\nCome to that, why does a modern police station have an underground labyrinth for its files, set in a rusty cage and lit by a single light bulb? It looks like a former KGB torture room that the Garda bought in a dodgy land deal.\n\nEven stranger, why is there apparently an oil refinery on the station\u2019s roof?\n\nIt adds to this show\u2019s impression that the whole of Ireland is one bleak industrial estate.\n\nNow we discover that Cassie is hiding a secret identity. A mysterious ghoul is stalking her, to ensure that she doesn\u2019t revert to her old name, Lexie.\n\nDublin Murders (BBC1) will need a very long run if viewers are ever going to work out what the pickled heck is going on. Rob (Killian Scott) and Cassie (Sarah Greene) are pictured above\n\nThis is especially confusing, since Rob is also disguising himself: he\u2019s leading an investigation into a murder in the woods, without telling anyone that he was involved in an almost identical case at the same spot 20 years ago.\n\nNobody recognises him, not even former friends, because he\u2019s changed his name. He used to be called Adam.\n\nIt\u2019s a brilliant ruse, which even fools the gossipy old woman in a mobility scooter \u2014 and she appears to remember the birth of every baby in Ireland since Val Doonican was in nappies.\n\nPerhaps she\u2019s just baffled by the size of the cast, nearly four dozen of them.\n\nBy the time we work out what\u2019s really going on, even Bake Off will be over.\n\nCatchphrases of the night\n\nLenny Henry unearthed a treasure trove of half-forgotten sayings in his survey of sitcoms with black stars, Race Through Comedy (Gold). \u2018Boo-yah!\u2019\n\n\u2018There\u2019s an old African saying . . .\u2019\n\n\u2018What\u2019choo talkin\u2019 bout, Willis?\u2019", "description": "CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: Hard to recall now, but for a few days back in the summer it was hotter in Britain than the Med.
