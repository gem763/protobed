REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File Photo\n\nVIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian sensor specialist AMS (AMS.S) had secured just 25% of Osram (OSRn.DE) shares shortly before its takeover offer is due to expire at midnight on Tuesday, and it may take days before it knows whether it has reached the 62.5% threshold.\n\nAMS is engaged in a bidding war with a private equity consortium for the German lighting group and said that it had secured 25.14% of Osram shares by Monday night.\n\nHowever, it could take several days to determine the total number of shares tendered to the Austrian company by the Tuesday night deadline, partly because institutional investors traditionally sell their stock at the last minute. Many of them do so via depositary banks, which could cause an additional delay.\n\nAMS upped its bid to 4.5 billion euros ($4.9 billion) last week after private equity group Bain Capital signaled it could team up with U.S. firm Advent to beat AMS\u2019s initial offer of 4.3 billion euros. Bain and Advent have made no further move so far.\n\nBain, together with Carlyle Group (CG.O), offered 4 billion euros for Osram, a leader in automotive lighting. It turned to Advent after AMS entered the ring and Carlyle was not ready to add more funds, sources have said.\n\nSwiss-listed AMS, which is best known for supplying Apple (AAPL.O) with sensors for iPhones, wants to expand in the auto industry and supply manufacturers with sensors and lighting systems for self-driving cars to reduce its dependence on smartphone producers.\n\nIf AMS fails with its offer, it cannot launch a new bid for 12 months, unless Osram and the German regulator give their approval.\n\nAllianz Global Investors ALG.DE, which holds 9.4% of Osram shares, signaled weeks ago that it might sell them to AMS.\n\nAs there is a public holiday in Germany on Thursday, there is a chance that the result will not be announced before Friday.", "description": "Austrian sensor specialist AMS had secured just 25% of Osram shares shortly before its takeover offer is due to expire at midnight on Tuesday, and it may take days before it knows whether it has reached the 62.5% threshold.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435886949&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902TF", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
