Just minutes later the same buyer picked up No. 21 for $1.41 million: $310,000 beyond the reserve price.\n\nFinally, No. 23 sold for $1,394,500 to a man from Brunei who flew in for the auction. That sale was almost $250,000 above the reserve price.\n\nPhilip Webb Doncaster East agent Robert Groeneveld said most buyers were interested in the adjoining properties individually, with less demand from developers looking to secure all three.\n\n\u201cThe interest that we had to buy all three together was a small pool,\u201d Mr Groeneveld said.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the interest was from people wanting to owner-occupy the home, not from builders and developers.\u201d\n\nBut the buyer of Nos. 19 and 21 planned to do a development project on the sites, Mr Groeneveld said.\n\nEach auction saw between three and four bidders competing, he said: \u201cthere\u2019s a shortage of quality properties on the market\u201d.\n\n\u201cQuality locations will always do well and this is certainly one of Doncaster\u2019s finest pockets.\u201d\n\nStill in Doncaster, an international buyer unwilling to compete in auction conditions placed a knockout offer to secure 16 Bordeaux St days before it went under the hammer.\n\nHaving missed out on two other homes in the area at recent auctions, the buyer submitted a $1.6 million offer for the five-bedroom house. The offer well exceeded the quoted price range of $1.38-$1.45 million.\n\nJellis Craig Doncaster director Chris Savvides said the buyers had seen the property for the first time the day before they submitted their offer and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to miss out\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey made a very strong offer above all the interest that we\u2019d had \u2014 way, way above,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe went back to the other buyers and there was no one within the range \u2014 the owners decided to take it.\u201d\n\nMr Savvides said his agency was selling less properties before auctions, as vendors sought to take advantage of lack of stock and multiple bidders to drive up prices.\n\nREAD MORE: World War II bunker conversion: Yelta property for sale as a house\n\n\n\nUp-and-coming actor Lucy-Rose Leonard\u2019s Kew childhood home stars on market\n\n\n\nThe Block 2019: Behind the scenes as relationships sour\n\njack.boronovskis@news.com.au\n\n@jackboronovskis", "description": "This auctioneer didn\u2019t have to go far between auctions in Manningham and Whitehorse, calling three that all soared more than $150,000 beyond reserve at half-hour intervals.", "authors": ["Jack Boronovskis"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/17104539/capi_0a77481406d8614af81c944c90cc7392_145ccd16a39d6f42eddf8d957d461be8.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
