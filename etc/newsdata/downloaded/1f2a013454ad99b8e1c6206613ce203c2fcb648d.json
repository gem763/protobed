But this tranquility was threatened by the arrival of the vacuum cleaner.\n\nIn the hilarious clip, the four-year-old Turkish Van cat starts trotting backwards as the home gadget lets out a piercing sound.\n\nSalty the Sea Cat, who lives on a yacht in Scotland, lands a couple of blows on the noisy vacuum cleaner\n\nThe owner then drops it on the floor and the kitty slowly edges closer and tilts his head before sniffing the nozzle.\n\nAs the appliance is lifted, he jolts backwards and lets out a hiss.\n\nHe flashes his sharp teeth to show how he feels threatened before licking his lips.\n\nSalty decides whether he likes the hoover in a matter of seconds (from left to right) and shows his teeth\n\nServing a hefty blow to the hoover, he hisses and then rests on his back legs as though he is ready for a fight.\n\nWithin seconds, the family pet whacks the Dyson with a loud thud of his paw.\n\nSalty's owners shared the encounter, which took place on July 5, on Twitter to show he will never be made to feel powerless by 'certain household appliances'.\n\nThe beloved pet, who lives with his owners and a springer spaniel called Pippa, cautiously sniffs the hoover after the machine let out a huge shriek\n\nThey then posted another clip of their beloved pet pawing the hoover on a table.\n\nThe video was captioned: 'Salty is sometimes Badass ! & does try to duff up certain household appliances. He is neither terrified nor poorly treated & anyone who posts unkind stuff can fluff off.'\n\nPeople were quick to show their solidarity with the cat.\n\nGail K.

Beastly thing.'\n\nThe kitty lives with owners Bernadette and Andy and Pippa the springer spaniel.\n\nThe family list Linnhe, Dunstaffnage, Craobh and Melfort in Scotland as their winter destinations, according to Scottish Field.\n\nSalty, whose real name is Neo, has 4,856 followers on Twitter and regularly shares pictures of his aspirational lifestyle which sees him relaxing on top deck.", "description": "Salty the Sea Cat handed out a few slaps to the noisy Dyson vacuum cleaner when he met it on board his family's yacht in Scotland.
