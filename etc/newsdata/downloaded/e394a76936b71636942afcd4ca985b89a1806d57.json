But after her death, aides including the former UK ambassador to Pretoria revealed she had privately pressed president PW Botha to free Mandela and end apartheid.\n\nMr Johnson said that to get to the launch, he had to brave the streets filled with \"unco-operative crusties and protestors of all kinds\" taking part in the Extinction Rebellion action to demand more decisive action against climate change.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
