Time matters more than you think\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that goes into job hunting. We update our CVs, clean up our social media accounts to present ourselves at our absolute best, and make sure to research the company and look into the kind of questions we can expect to be asked.\n\nHowever, in the preparation phase, there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s often overlooked, and that is the timing of your actual interview. Because one\u2019s efforts are usually focused on the potential content of the interview, little thought is actually given to the day and time the interview should take place.\n\nOf course, not every hiring manager or recruiter provides you with the option of choosing a time when your interview should take place.\n\nHowever, if the option is there, it is important to avoid being too hasty because you're in a hurry to get that potential job and just want to get the interview over and done with.\n\nSo what factors should be taken into consideration when you decide on a time? Which days should you avoid? And how do your concentration span and energy levels fit into the equation?\n\nBefore you even consider the time that best suits you, think about your personal and work habits. What are the peak times at which you function? Knowing and understanding the times when you're at your highest functioning level plays a vital part in the interview process.\n\nYou can have all the answers at the tip of your finger, but if you're being interviewed late afternoon during a time you often experience a slump, chances are that the level of your responses won\u2019t be at its best.\n\nResearch has also shown that there are certain times of the day and specific days in the week that work better for everyone involved. So, how do you utilise this to your advantage?\n\nWe list a few do\u2019s and don\u2019ts that will come in handy.\n\nREAD MORE: Thinking like a recruiter: how they choose the one\n\nDon\u2019t: Schedule an interview between 08h00 and 09h00\n\nAccording to Rusty Rueff from Glassdoor, technically early mornings should be ideal for interviews since people are most alert then, but the downside to this is that early mornings often mean that hiring managers and recruiters haven\u2019t had the time to sit down at their desk and plan and prioritise the rest of the day yet.\n\nMost people use the first hour of work to settle in, check emails and take care of anything that might be a distraction during the rest of the day, so arranging for an interview during this time is often considered counterproductive.\n\nDo: schedule between 10h30 to 12h00\n\nThe ideal time for an interview is the period before lunch and just after the first hour and a half of the morning.\n\nThe hours between 10h30 and 12h00 are considered golden because it's the period where no difficult decisions or any major meetings have taken place yet and as a result, reduces the chances of decision fatigue creeping in. Lily Zhang reveals in a piece for The Muse.com, that as the day progresses, so does your ability to make reliable decisions. This is why it\u2019s also recommended that you don\u2019t schedule your interview too late in the afternoon as well.\n\nThis can work against both recruiter and candidate as the hiring manager could gloss over or not take in enough essential details and you as the candidate could perhaps not be at your best since afternoon slumps impact on you as well.\n\nMondays are generally never considered a good idea for interviews (or for any meetings for that matter) because you not only spend time recovering from the weekend and gearing yourself up for the week ahead, but because Monday is often used to tie up loose ends left over from Friday. Friday is just as bad except, by then, most people are looking forward to the weekend and their focus is far from work and on anything that requires intensive decision-making.\n\nThe idea behind your interview is to ensure that you create a memorable impression \u2013 you want people to remember you, which is why doing interviews before a long-weekend is also not advised because, according to career expert Rusty Rueff, people tend to be more focused on trying to get other work done before going on holiday\n\nInstead: aim for mid-week interviews between 10h30 and 12h00. Tuesdays have been known to be particularly useful days for meetings and interviews as people are far more productive then.\n\nAs much as we try to evade it, there are specific biases that unfortunately do come into play. While you may find yourself benefiting from primacy bias (particularly if you are a solid candidate), you are also competing against many other candidates vying for the same position.\n\nSetting the benchmark means you can\u2019t really surpass it and interviewers will inadvertently compare you to other candidates, says Lily Zhang.\n\nOn the other hand, you don\u2019t want to be the last candidate either. While you certainly want to aim to be the most recent interviewee on the hiring manager\u2019s mind, recency bias won\u2019t really hold up against a bad interview\n\nYou might, as mentioned above, also run the risk of being subjected to decision fatigue, which may lower your chances of getting hired.\n\nWhen it comes to finding new work, the number one focus is always ensuring that you are well prepared and have the experience and examples to back up your \u201csales pitch.\u201d\n\nHowever, learning to be strategic about scheduling your interviews can go a long way in giving you an extra boost.\n\nWriter | Tammy February", "description": "Mornings or afternoons, first or last: when should you really schedule that job interview?\nTime matters more than you think", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9041/216b2c75b38f49faabb1f3fe1f9f634f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
