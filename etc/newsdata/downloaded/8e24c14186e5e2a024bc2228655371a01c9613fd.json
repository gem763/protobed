According to a statement from China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation, Cook met with the Agency\u2019s chief Xiao Yaqing this week to discuss a number of topics.\n\nSome of the topics discussed reportedly included Apple\u2019s investment in China, consumer rights protection, and corporate social responsibility. Cook has defended the company\u2019s recent decision to remove the HKmap.live app from its store, stating that they had received \u201ccredible information\u201d from authorities that the software was being used \u201cmaliciously\u201d to attack police.\n\nThe company has flip-flopped repeatedly on whether the app should be allowed in the store, initially telling developers: \u201cYour app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement,\u201d and banning the app.\n\nFollowing an outcry over the initial banning, the app was reinstated to Apple\u2019s store. After criticism from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, which stated that the app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior,\u201d leading it to question if Apple was \u201cguiding Hong Kong thugs,\u201d The Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have once against bowed to the wishes of communist China and removed the app.\n\nCook wrote in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News: \u201cOver the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.\u201d\n\nProminent Hong Kong lawmaker, Charles Mok, penned an open letter on Twitter criticizing Apple\u2019s decision, stating: \u201cI sincerely hope that Apple will choose to support its users and stop banning HKmap.live simply out of political reason [sic] or succumbing to China\u2019s influence like other American companies appear to be doing.\u201d\n\nChina is still a major market for Apple despite the Chinese state media\u2019s criticism. Greater China which includes mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan was Apple\u2019s third-biggest market in the third quarter this year generating $9.1 billion in revenue.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
