They had an infielder in the lineup who barely played in the past month, went to their bullpen early to bring in their own Cy Young Award winner and kept changing pitchers the same way they did throughout the playoffs.\n\nIn the end, they still couldn\u2019t win three straight AL Division Series games against a trio of Astros arms with a combined salary of $66 million \u2014 about the same as the entire Tampa Bay payroll.\n\nGerrit Cole struck out 10 more Rays in eight innings, following his 15-strikeout performance in Game 2, and Houston won 6-1 in the decisive Game 5 to end Tampa Bay\u2019s outstanding season and advance to a third consecutive AL Championship Series.\n\n\u201cI think we surprised a lot of people. We believed in ourselves the whole way, we believed we could have done it. We went up against the best team, we gave them a fight in five games,\u201d said Eric Sogard, the journeyman second baseman who homered in his only start this postseason. \u201cThe best pitcher in the game beat us twice. \u2026 You\u2019ve got to tip your hat sometime.\u201d\n\nAfter victories at home over Cy Young winners Zack Greinke and Justin Verlander to force this juicy series from Tropicana Field back to Minute Maid Park, the plucky Rays returned to Houston somewhat perturbed by a perceived lack of credit for what they had done.\n\nBefore winning Games 3 and 4 to extend the ALDS, they had already averted an early exit by winning the wild-card game in Oakland.\n\n\u201cIt is really, really disappointing,\u201d shortstop Willy Adames said. \u201cCole was unbelievable again. I don\u2019t know if anybody can get better than that. He was unbelievable last start, and today was still the same. We just couldn\u2019t make an adjustment.\u201d\n\nInstead of the Rays heading to New York for the ALCS, the Yankees will be in Houston for Game 1 on Saturday night.\n\nExcept for the homer by Sogard, who hadn\u2019t started since Sept. 14 because of lingering right foot discomfort, the Rays couldn\u2019t muster much against the major league strikeout leader who next month could become the third Cy Young Award winner on Houston\u2019s 2019 staff.\n\nCole struck out the first two batters of the game. Glasnow, like Cole a former Pirates pitcher before Pittsburgh traded away both right-handers in 2018, allowed hits to his first four batters \u2014 and all scored.\n\nIt was clear by how Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman communicated things to teammates after they had back-to-back RBI hits that they perhaps knew what was coming from Glasnow. The pitcher noticed on video later how he was tipping his pitches.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty obvious as far as the tips go,\u201d said Glasnow, refusing to use that as an excuse for his rough start. \u201cI left some pitches that were there to hit, like over the middle of the plate, and they\u2019re really good hitters and they can do things, I don\u2019t care how hard you throw.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay\u2019s pitching coach made a mound visit only three batters, and seven pitches, into the game to talk to Glasnow.\n\nThe 26-year-old right-hander threw 31 of 40 pitches for strikes and struck out three, but was done after 2 2/3 innings. Blake Snell, last year\u2019s AL Cy Young winner who lost Game 2 and saved Game 4, took over for 1 1/3 innings before manager Kevin Cash used seven more relievers to finish the game \u2014 six of them didn\u2019t even throw a full inning.\n\nTampa Bay used at least five pitchers in every game, and an ALDS-record 31 overall in the five-game series.\n\nAfter Ji-Man Choi\u2019s single leading off the fourth for Tampa Bay\u2019s only other hit, Cole got 15 outs over the next 15 batters \u2014 benefiting from a double play after a walk in the seventh.\n\nThe Rays were down 4-0 before Sogard, acquired from Toronto in a July trade, went deep to right on the first pitch of the second inning.\n\nThey never got any closer.\n\n\u201cIt stings a little bit right now, but I\u2019m so proud to be part of this team and this organization,\u201d center fielder Kevin Kiermaier said. \u201cIt was the most fun I\u2019ve ever had playing baseball, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Unable to beat three aces in a row, the Tampa Bay Rays finally folded against Houston.
