Tulsi Gabbard speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton suggested that the Russian government was \u201cgrooming\u201d her for a third-party run in the 2020 presidential elections, Hawaii representative and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard returned fire Friday afternoon, challenging the 2016 Democratic nominee to join her in the 2020 primaries.\n\nIn a fiery response to Clinton\u2019s accusation, Gabbard called the former secretary of state \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.

Join the race directly. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nThe staunchly non-interventionist Gabbard has been consistently dogged by suggestions that her campaign panders to the alt-right and Russia. During Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate, she accused CNN and the New York Times, who were co-hosting the event, of smearing her with \u201ccompletely despicable coverage.\u201d\n\nClinton made headlines earlier Friday for suggesting that Gabbard was \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d among the field, and that the Kremlin was \u201cgrooming\u201d her for a \u201cvigorous third-party challenge in the key states\u201d in 2020.", "description": "After Hillary Clinton suggested that the Russian government was \"grooming\" her for a third-party run in the 2020 presidential elections, Hawaii representative and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard returned fire Friday afternoon, challenging the 2016 Democratic nominee to join the 2020 Democratic primary.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
