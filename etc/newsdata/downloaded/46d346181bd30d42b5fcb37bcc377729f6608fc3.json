REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Zalando, Europe\u2019s biggest online-only fashion retailer, set a goal on Tuesday for women to hold at least 40% of top management jobs by the end of 2023 after facing criticism for its all-male management board and lack of diversity targets.\n\nThe Berlin-based company, whose customers are disproportionately women, said it was aiming for a balanced representation of women and men in its top six management levels by 2023 and was also paying attention to non-binary genders.\n\n\u201cDuring the past 11 years, we have been very focused on establishing and growing our business, and we didn\u2019t put enough effort into countering structural imbalances that have evolved,\u201d co-Chief Executive Rubin Ritter said in a statement.\n\nTo help it reach the goal, Zalando said it would make changes to its decision-making bodies and committees, change hiring practices and work on succession planning.\n\nGermany has long been a laggard in promoting women to senior positions in the business world: women account for only 9% of management board positions in the top 200 companies, according to the DIW Berlin economic institute.\n\nGermany passed legislation in 2015 demanding that women hold 30% of the seats on supervisory boards of large companies. There is no quota for management boards, but some politicians have threatened to impose one here too if progress is not made soon.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Zalando has recognised the importance of gender diversity in management and has set its own targets is very encouraging,\u201d said Katharina Wrohlich, head of the gender economics research group at DIW Berlin.\n\nJennifer Morgan became the first female head of a German blue-chip company last week as co-CEO of software company SAP. Ailing conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, which has just been relegated from the benchmark DAX index, appointed Martina Merz as interim CEO last month.[L5N26L4QR]\n\nZalando is currently run by a management board of five men, while it has three women out of nine people on its supervisory board - including chairwoman Cristina Stenbeck - and 29% of senior vice presidents are women.", "description": "Zalando, Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer, set a goal on Tuesday for women to hold at least 40% of top management jobs by the end of 2023 after facing criticism for its all-male management board and lack of diversity targets.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441107686&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E11M", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
