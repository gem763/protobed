There\u2019s the heaps of Gruyere and sharp cheddar and cream cheese, the jeans and white socks and perfectly slicked hair, the Yves Klein blue stove and marble countertop and copper pots. Take your pick.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having cheese for breakfast,\u201d he says, because it is 8 a.m. \u201cGooey, crispy little gratin cheese.\u201d\n\n[Cannabis restaurants are coming to California, with \u2018budtenders\u2019 and \u2018flower\u2019 service]\n\nSpecifically, the \u201cQueer Eye\u201d star is making Cheesy Lemon-Rosemary Artichoke Dip, a recipe from his new cookbook, \u201cAntoni in the Kitchen.\u201d It\u2019s a recipe he selected, not only because it brought back warm memories of cooking with his sister, but because it evokes his favorite time of year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for the fall,\u201d he says, grating some off-recipe Parmesan (\u201ca beautiful two-year\u201d) into the mix, just for fun. \u201cOh my gosh, a tiny piece of cheese literally shot into my mouth,\u201d he says, delighted. When he totals it up, there are 24 ounces of cheese altogether.\n\n\n\nAntoni Porowski grates a block of cheese while preparing lemon-artichoke dip in the kitchen of his New York City home. (Jesse Dittmar for The Washington Post)\n\n[Make the recipe: Cheesy Lemon-Rosemary Artichoke Dip]\n\nIt seemed like an odd recipe to pick, considering there are more complex options in the book \u2014 recipes that showcase stronger flavors, or a piece of Porowski\u2019s Polish heritage. But it doesn\u2019t take long to realize: Antoni Porowski is cheese dip. He\u2019s decadent but unfussy, he\u2019s comforting, he\u2019s nostalgic, and he\u2019s easygoing but intense under the surface, once you dig in there with a little piece of endive and scrape out all of those soft, gooey bits.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether Porowski can cook, which was a persistent hot take in 2018. His recipes for the heroes, as \u201cQueer Eye\u201d calls its makeover candidates, were judged for being overly simplistic, forcing Porowski to spend months reiterating that he was tailoring them for his subjects, who might only be able to manage a simple avocado grapefruit salad because they barely knew how to use their ovens.\n\n[Yes, the Popeyes chicken sandwich is great. Here\u2019s how it stacks up against the competition.]\n\nThe question is what kind of cooking Porowski has decided to showcase after that criticism exacerbated his already bad case of impostor syndrome. At first, he had the natural impulse to prove his skeptics wrong.\n\n\u201cWhen I came into Season 3, the first two recipes, I tried to way overcomplicate them,\u201d he says. At the same time, he was a partner in a restaurant, the Village Den, and he saw that as another proving ground. \u201cIt was sort of like, this is how I\u2019m going to show people. But once I got my butt into the kitchen and started testing it out, that thought went away quickly because it was sort of like, holy s\u2014, I\u2019m opening a restaurant.\u201d\n\n\n\nNew-Style Polish Hunter\u2019s Stew from Porowski\u2019s cookbook, \u201cAntoni in the Kitchen.\u201d (Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\n[Make the recipe: New-Style Polish Hunter\u2019s Stew (Bigos Revisited)]\n\nThe book project began the same way, almost as a rebuke: See? Porowski can make macadamia-crusted lamb with spicy honey agrodolce! And strawberry and pink peppercorn Eton mess! And after all of those memes about his guacamole, there is not a single avocado-centric recipe in it.\n\nBut eventually, \u201cI realized this isn\u2019t about that,\u201d Porowski says. \u201cThe best feedback that I\u2019ve gotten on \u2018Queer Eye\u2019 is when things are deeply personal. I think we really have a need to see vulnerability these days.\u201d\n\nIt turned into something different. It became an autobiography.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply sentimental book that also shows that he has real chops,\u201d said Beth Barden, a Kansas City restaurateur who helped Porowski test his recipes. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a really beautiful version of a memoir.\u201d\n\nPorowski was born in Montreal to a family that emigrated from Poland. He grew up speaking Polish at home, and his heritage is reflected in the book, with dishes like zurek (\u201cthe Polish hangover soup\u201d), chilled beet soup and Bigos, a rich and hearty three-meat hunter\u2019s stew with mushrooms, cabbage and prunes. Porowski\u2019s version subs wine for beer, to add a little French influence.\n\n[This hotel launched a $295 room service menu just for making YouTube videos]\n\n\u201cEvery household has a different way of doing it,\u201d Porowski says. \u201cI\u2019m not 100 percent sure how my mother made it. But one thing that she did teach me was wild mushrooms. We would go foraging during mushroom season as kids.\u201d\n\nPorowski isn\u2019t sure how his mother made the dish because, as he says in the book\u2019s intro, he never cooked with her. And if you read between the lines of that little aside \u2014 and the others peppered throughout the book \u2014 you\u2019ll see pain and loss creeping in at the corners of many of his recipes.\n\n\n\nFrom left, Bobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Tan France, Antoni Porowski and Jonathan Van Ness, cast members from the television series \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d present the award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series at the Emmy Awards in September. (Phil McCarten/AP)\n\nDespite his fame, he still hasn\u2019t cooked with his mother, because they no longer have a relationship. When he writes about cooking \u201cMartha Stewart Living\u201d recipes as a teenager with his sister, Aleks, he says they \u201cdidn\u2019t get along very well,\u201d and that cooking was the common passion that bound them together. Many recipes mention happy times with Joey Krietemeyer, Porowski\u2019s former partner of seven years, whose family gatherings provided him with a sense of togetherness he hadn\u2019t found in his own.\n\n\u201cI sort of had this debate about, well, do I want to include them or not? I just decided, like, even though it\u2019s really painful to write about, it\u2019s very happy-sad,\u201d he says of Krietemeyer\u2019s family. \u201cI had a family that taught me unconditional love, and I just thought it just didn\u2019t feel right not including them. So I decided, like, that\u2019s painful, but you can struggle through it and put the sadness in another compartment, and I can deal with that later in life. Let\u2019s do this recipe in honor of these people who were there for me.\u201d\n\n[Add wine water to the list of options for the sober-curious and LaCroix-fatigued]\n\nThe book will show you who Porowski has loved, but also what he has loved to make for them.\n\n\u201cFood, for him, I think more than anything, is a love language,\u201d Barden said. \u201cIt\u2019s the true way that he expresses himself to the people he cares for. I think he sees himself as being in the service of others.\u201d\n\n\n\nPorowski in the kitchen of his New York restaurant, the Village Den. (Jesse Dittmar for The Washington Post)\n\nOn \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d that might mean teaching a single dad how to make pancakes, or a disheveled app bro to master grilled cheese. But only a few Queer Eye recipes \u2014 or references to the show, really \u2014 appear in the book, though there are nods to his castmates\u2019 favorite recipes.\n\n\u201cIf it was just recipes from the show, people have seen them already,\u201d said his co-author, Mindy Fox. \u201cYou get a little window into Antoni\u2019s life and his progression with food as a medium for his creativity and his passion.\u201d\n\nHis life: Newly single after a breakup with Bravo star Trace Lehnhoff. A new art collector eager to show visitors his acquisitions, including a jokey Flemish Baroque portrait of the Fab Five in a gilded frame \u2014 a gift from \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d Kate McKinnon. His fridge contains oat milk, cold brew, lingonberry jam and some carrots that have seen better days \u2014 probably because he\u2019s not home much, now that the show is filming its fifth season in Philadelphia. Though he\u2019s known for his obsession with dogs, he doesn\u2019t own one. (The dog photographed with him in the cookbook belongs to the actor Justin Theroux, a friend.) He\u2019s working his way through \u201cFleabag.\u201d He dreams in both French and English. He knows he shouldn\u2019t, but he Juuls (mint, in case you were wondering).\n\nLater in the day, we sit in a corner booth at his West Village restaurant, the Village Den, while guests not-so-subtly take photos of him. Though Porowski doesn\u2019t work in the kitchen, he is responsible for the menu and pays attention to details: As soon as we arrived, he went back into the kitchen to check on a pineapple chutney that was not up to his standards.\n\nThe pineapple was \u201cbeing cut into very large pieces. And it came to my attention via people posting on Instagram, \u2018cause that\u2019s how I check when I\u2019m out of town,\u201d he says. It\u2019s an accompaniment to some jerk chicken meatballs at the fast-casual health cafe with a comfort food bent.\n\n\n\nLemon Artichoke Dip from \u201cAntoni in the Kitchen.\u201d (Tom McCorkle for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nThough he spent years as a server, going back into the kitchen of his own restaurant still feels awkward.\n\n\u201cI would apologize for going back, and I would ask for permission,\u201d he says. He suspects he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to accept the fact that it was mine.\u201d\n\nBut his impostor syndrome is gradually subsiding. A stand-alone food show is something he has been \u201cactively discussing,\u201d and a second location of his restaurant is in the works.\n\n\u201cA lot of facets of my life, I thought, like, I\u2019m not a chef and no one\u2019s going to take me seriously,\u201d he says. But with the book, he realized that not being a chef gave him freedom for \u201cmore of an emotional exploration,\u201d one that allows for simple, nostalgic weekday recipes. \u201cMy book is about my personal experience and these dishes that have shaped me. And I put them in there because they\u2019re important,\u201d he says.\n\nThat includes his experience as an immigrant. Now that he is a permanent resident of the United States, Porowski finds his nationality gets truncated: Rather than Polish Canadian, he is mistaken for Canadian American, which feels strange to him. Immigration, and the blend of cultures and flavors he was exposed to in Montreal, is key to the book. It\u2019s also a point of personal reflection for him \u2014 just as his fluid sexuality allowed him to be mistaken for straight for much of his life and evade homophobia, his whiteness and unaccented English gives him privileges other immigrants don\u2019t share.\n\n\u201cThis country has given me a life that I never even really dreamed of,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I feel like I compensate whenever I \u2026 have the opportunity to talk about diversity.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Jesse Dittmar for The Washington Post)\n\nThat appears in the recipes, which include Indian, Malaysian, Greek, Mexican and Japanese, and in upcoming seasons of the show, for which he says the immigrant experience will become more of a talking point.\n\nFor both, \u201cthe goal is really to bridge people together,\u201d he says. \u201cYeah, I know, that sounds like such a \u2018Queer Eye\u2019 line.\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nHate on the Hudson (Yards): How bad can it be?\n\nWe tried 13 popular potato chip brands, and our top and bottom picks might just surprise you\n\nTofurky takes Arkansas to court over the word \u2018meat\u2019", "description": "The cookbook doubles as a sentimental autobiography, touching on insecurities, pain and growth.", "authors": ["Maura Judkis", "Reporter Covering Culture", "Food", "The Arts", "Maura Judkis Is A Reporter For The Washington Post", "Covering Culture", "The Arts.
