Instead, echoing recent polling, the move toward impeachment appears only to have widened the existing partisan divide \u2014 and plunged the Democrats who ran on rising above it straight into the split.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come to Congress to pursue an impeachment inquiry \u2014 it was the last thing in the world I wanted,\u201d freshman Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) told constituents at Allentown\u2019s Muhlenberg College on Wednesday. \u201cHere we are, and all I can say is we are guided by the actions of the administration.\u201d\n\nTrump says House has votes to impeach, but believes Republicans in Senate will exonerate him\n\nThe audience there was largely supportive of impeachment, although of the two dozen questions, only a couple were on that subject. The rest were on health care, education, climate change and local issues.\n\n\u201cI get impeachment, and I support it at this point, but I\u2019d like to see continued progress in other areas,\u201d said Ian Tauber, a 52-year-old college administrator, who told a reporter before the event that he wanted to hear more about gun legislation.\n\nAD\n\nThe task of explaining the snowballing impeachment effort is especially sensitive for freshmen such as Slotkin and Wild, who unseated Republicans last year in districts that voted for Trump in 2016 by running on a platform focused on health care and other pocketbook issues and have spent the 11 months since trying to keep those issues at the forefront. That is now futile, they are acknowledging in various ways, as they look ahead to a possible vote, perhaps as early as this year, and reelection campaigns in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nIn Virginia Beach, Rep. Elaine Luria (Va.) reserved a sizable chunk of her Thursday town hall for impeachment questions. In Chicago\u2019s western suburbs, Rep. Sean Casten (Ill.) scheduled a day-long marathon of six impeachment-focused town halls. On Staten Island, Rep. Max Rose (N.Y.) \u2014 who initially refrained from endorsing the impeachment investigation \u2014 began his town hall Wednesday by declaring his support for the probe. And in Michigan, Slotkin moved two of three planned \u201ccoffee hour\u201d events last week to larger, coffee-free venues after the first one drew a crowd that overwhelmed an East Lansing restaurant.\n\nTo keep public attention on other issues, several other Democrats have scheduled narrowly tailored events. In Naperville, Ill., on Tuesday, Rep. Lauren Underwood hosted a town hall focused on the \u201cYouth Vaping Epidemic\u201d \u2014 one aimed at soliciting input on legislation to curb underage vaping that attracted mainly high school students. Only at the end of the evening did impeachment come up.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWith all that\u2019s going on with impeachment \u2014 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the first one to mention that \u2014 what will the next steps be?\u201d asked Jacob Gorgey, a senior at nearby Waubonsie Valley High School. He referred to vaping laws, not removing Trump.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDespite other allegations, no one is stopping or pausing,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cWe are moving forward.\u201d\n\nAbout 35 miles north that same night, about 100 people attended Casten\u2019s health-care event in Deer Park, Ill., and they mainly stayed on topic \u2014 sharing concerns about the costs of prescription drugs, long-term care and health care generally. Only beforehand to a reporter did Casten venture thoughts about impeachment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe betrayed his own oath, he betrayed the country, he put our national security at risk to try and manufacture political dirt on an opponent,\u201d Casten said, citing the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. \u201cI think we\u2019ve reached the point, this is what we have to do.\u201d\n\nOdd markings, ellipses fuel doubts about the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call\n\nHouston-area Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (Tex.) also stayed topical, spending more than two hours at a community college Friday discussing gun violence with police, doctors and families victimized by shootings. A late endorser of impeachment proceedings, she told reporters she was not concerned about a backlash from her constituents in a district Trump narrowly lost in 2016.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to be able to tell them next year all the things that I\u2019ve done to help the community, whether it is making sure that we get Hurricane Harvey funding here or expand the Port of Houston or tackle the challenges we face with health care or gun violence,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on doing my job, and part of doing my job is making sure that we investigate where necessary, that we protect our national security.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRose, a combative New Yorker who has been targeted alongside other Trump-district freshmen, confronted the issue head-on, announcing his late-breaking support for the impeachment probe at an otherwise sedate Staten Island town hall Tuesday. He then pivoted to transportation.\n\nAfter the National Republican Congressional Committee accused him of \u201ccommitting political suicide\u201d and other GOP groups targeted him with digital ads, he told reporters he was not especially concerned about his political future.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey already tried once, and we kicked their a--,\u201d the decorated Army veteran who served in Afghanistan told reporters after the town hall. \u201cGuess what? That\u2019s exactly what is going to happen again. They have been absolute jokes. They will continue to be jokes. And I look forward to beating them by an incredible margin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Slotkin and Luria \u2014 both among the seven Democrats with national security backgrounds who backed an impeachment probe in a Sept. 23 Washington Post op-ed that helped persuade House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to initiate the proceedings \u2014 have stuck to a much graver tone.\n\nSeven freshman Democrats: These allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect\n\nAs a small group of Republicans protested outside, Luria set aside time at the top of her town hall Thursday at New Hope Baptist Church to answer written questions exclusively about the inquiry. Of the 15 questions and comments read by the moderator, about half praised her decision and half criticized it.\n\nAD\n\nOne person just wrote \u201cthank you\u201d in big letters on an index card. Another wanted to know, \u201cWhy are you ignoring your constituents by bolstering impeachment?\u201d Her military-heavy swing district voted for Trump by four points in 2016 and elected her by about half that last year.\n\nAD\n\nMost of the crowd appeared to support Luria, a former Navy commander who received several standing ovations, but at least one vocal detractor shouted during her answers, prompting the moderator to tell him to quiet down or leave.\n\nFaced with a more evenly divided crowd in Michigan on Thursday, Slotkin explained her decision to support the impeachment probe \u2014 as Trump supporters challenged her interpretation of the Zelensky phone call, questioned whether former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter ought to be investigated, and pressed the former CIA officer on whether she knows the whistleblower who sparked the Ukraine inquiry. (She does not.)\n\nAD\n\nOnly once \u2014 after one constituent suggested that Trump \u201ccan\u2019t trust the FBI or the CIA right now\u201d \u2014 did Slotkin flash impatience: \u201cI know exactly what those people are doing, risking their life every day alongside our military. And, frankly, I have a hard time hearing that, I\u2019ll be honest with you.\u201d\n\nMarcia Dicks, a 71-year-old Republican retiree from nearby Tyrone Township, started her question with a compliment: She was pleasantly surprised by a recent appearance Slotkin made on Fox News Channel and by the letter her office had sent in response to an immigration question.\n\n\u201cBut when you fell off the cliff for me was when you joined the coup against our president,\u201d Dicks said, echoing a word Trump himself had used in a tweet earlier that week. \u201cGive me a break: The election\u2019s coming up. If you don\u2019t like him, vote him out if you can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s where I was for many, many months,\u201d Slotkin responded. \u201cAnd I can just tell you my own decision-making, and I know that it\u2019s clearly not popular. But I just felt compelled to do it because I just don\u2019t know where this ends.\u201d\n\nIn an interview afterward, Slotkin said she believed her constituents remained more concerned about other issues, pointing to conversations she\u2019s had in more spontaneous settings. At her three public events this week, she spent as much or more time talking about her efforts to lower prescription drug prices and keep the toxic chemicals known as PFAS out of Michigan\u2019s water.\n\nBut Slotkin said she had a responsibility to stand in front of her constituents and explain her positions \u2014 a view shared by the close-knit group of national security freshmen, who are now comparing notes on the responses they\u2019re getting.\n\n\u201cAll of us pretty much knew that this decision was going to be controversial,\u201d Slotkin said. \u201cBut coming out and hearing it from your constituents is another thing.\u201d\n\nPhillips reported from Allentown, Pa.
