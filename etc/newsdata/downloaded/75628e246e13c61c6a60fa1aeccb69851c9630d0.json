He could spend decades in prison if convicted.\n\nOn Monday he appeared clean-shaven, without the long beard he had worn at his last public appearance in May, when he was sentenced to 50 weeks jail for skipping bail. He appeared in good health, with his white hair combed back and wearing a navy suit over a light blue sweater and white shirt.\n\nBut he mumbled and stuttered for several seconds as he gave his name and date of birth at the start of a preliminary hearing in the case.\n\nWhen the judge asked him at the end of the hearing if he knew what was happening, he replied \u201cnot exactly\u201d, complained about the conditions in jail, and said he was unable to \u201cthink properly\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how this is equitable,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t research anything, I can\u2019t access any of my writing. It\u2019s very difficult where I am.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage WikiLeaks founder Assange denied delay to extradition hearing by London judge\n\nAssange is being held in British jail pending the U.S. extradition, having served his sentence for skipping bail.\n\nHe fled to the embassy in 2012 to avoid being sent to Sweden to face sex crimes accusations. He says the U.S. charges against him are a political attempt to silence journalists and publishers, and the Swedish allegations were part of a plot to catch him. Sweden is reviewing the sex crimes cases.\n\nThe former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone was among Assange\u2019s supporters in the public gallery, while protesters gathered outside court.\n\nAssange\u2019s lawyer Mark Summers argued that Assange\u2019s extradition hearing, scheduled for February 2020, should be delayed by three months due to the complexity of the case.\n\n\u201cThe evidence in this case would test the limits of most lawyers,\u201d Summers told the court. He cited the difficulty of communicating with Assange who he said doesn\u2019t have a computer in prison. The judge denied the request to delay the hearing.\n\nAustralian-born Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nWikiLeaks later angered the United States by publishing caches of leaked military documents and diplomatic cables.\n\nAdmirers have hailed Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech.
