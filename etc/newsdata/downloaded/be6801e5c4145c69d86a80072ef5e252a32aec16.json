Council member Charles Allen repeatedly expressed disappointment Wednesday that federal prosecutors did not send a representative to his Judiciary Committee hearing on the lack of prosecution of hate crimes in the District.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just offensive or insulting to the council or to me, it is insulting and offensive to the entire city, to every District resident,\u201d said Mr. Allen, the committee\u2019s chairman.\n\nThe Ward 6 Democrat also noted that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) did not respond to two letters from D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city\u2019s nonvoting congressional representative, seeking more information about hate crimes in the District.\n\n\u201cWhat in the world do you think it tells our LGBTQ community, that the USAO won\u2019t even show up for a conversation about hate crimes?\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cIt is deeply offensive.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney Jessica Liu submitted a letter to the committee Wednesday in lieu of attending the hearing, noting the challenges her office faces in prosecuting hate crimes and ways in which it is addressing the issue.\n\n\u201cWe regularly participate in open dialogue about combating bias-related crimes \u2026 But we will not testify in person at today\u2019s hearing, as its title shows that the Committee has reached a conclusion \u2014 that the Office is failing to prosecute potential bias-related offenses \u2014 before a full and fair consideration of the facts,\u201d Miss Liu said in a press release, noting the hearing\u2019s title \u2014 \u201cHate Crimes in the District of Columbia and the Failure to Prosecute by the Office of the United States Attorney.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis unjustly maligns the Office\u2019s dedicated career prosecutors, who carefully review every arrest identified as a potential bias-related crime and make principled charging decisions based solely on the law and the facts,\u201d the U.S. attorney for the District wrote.\n\nIn a brief interview with The Washington Times after the hearing, Ms. Liu said her office has a number of full-time staff dedicated to working with victims and in the community and that she has met with the Anti-Defamation League and Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners on the topic.\n\nShe also said that successfully prosecuting hate crimes can be difficult.\n\n\u201cWhen we actually bring the bias enhancement, we have to believe we can prove it beyond reasonable doubt or we are ethically [compromised],\u201d Ms. Liu told The Times, adding that she responded to Mrs. Norton\u2019s letters on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Allen scheduled Wednesday\u2019s hearing after The Washington Post detailed a recent increase in hate crimes in the District while the U.S. attorney\u2019s office has prosecuted five cases with the hate crime enhancement of the 113 cases the Metropolitan Police Department made arrests for in 2017 and 2018 \u2014 a record low.\n\nIn the District, local crimes are prosecuted by the U.S. attorney, who is appointed by the president, which Mr. Allen said makes it difficult to hold the office accountable.\n\nDeputy Mayor for Public Safety Kevin Donahue said the city is seeing a 14% increase in hate crimes from this time last year, and there was a 16% increase in hate crimes in 2018.\n\nIn her written testimony, Ms. Liu said that the jury instructions do not make clear whether the motivation for the crime has to be solely bias-related or only partially in order to receive the hate crime enhancement, which allows a court to fine or sentence a hate crime felon up to 1\u00bd times the amount of the underlying crime.\n\nMike Silverstein, an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for ANC 2B06, said jury instructions need to be updated, adding that they \u201cdo not even include the phrase \u2018gender identity\u2019 but they do include outdated language such as \u2018handicap\u2019 instead of \u2018disability.\u2019 Clean it up, make it clear.\u201d\n\nMr. Allen said that although the council does not write the jury instructions, it can change the language in the statute that defines hate crimes, which would inform the jury instructions.\n\n\u201cOne would think, if she feels that the statute needs to change, she\u2019d actually go talk to the people who write the statute,\u201d Mr. Allen said of Ms. Liu.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
