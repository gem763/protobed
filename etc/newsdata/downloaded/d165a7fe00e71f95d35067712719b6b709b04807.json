When Mulvaney realized what a disastrous blooper this was, he tried to walk it back by issuing a statement claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he said. But even in D.C., even in these crazy times, you can\u2019t put the genie back in the bottle.\n\nMulvaney was apparently unprepared to answer questions on the Ukraine debacle, since he was trotted out to announce that Trump planned to hold the next G7 conference at his Miami resort, Trump National Doral. It was \u201cby far and away, far and away, the best physical facility for this meeting....It\u2019s almost like they built this facility to host this type of event,\u201d Mulvaney intoned, mustering the same enthusiasm Sean Spicer once summoned when he claimed that Trump\u2019s inaugural crowd was the biggest ever. (Will we see Mulvaney on Dancing with the Stars sometime soon?)\n\nBut wait, what\u2019s this? In a rare reversal, last night the president tweeted: \u201cBased on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you!\u201d\n\nWas this sudden shift an indication that the president is beginning to crack under the pressure? (Nancy Pelosi certainly thinks so, but more on that in a minute.) The White House is currently dealing with two crises\u2014there\u2019s the growing calls for impeachment, or at least a serious impeachment inquiry, as details of the Ukrainian quid pro quo scandal continue to unfold. Last week a number of diplomats defied the administration and testified to the house committee, all of them more or less confirming the whistleblower\u2019s allegations. And then there is the nightmare that has resulted from Trump\u2019s precipitous decision to pull troops from Northern Syria, abandon our allies the Kurds, and trigger a Turkish offensive, a move that even top Republicans hate. On Friday, Senate majority leader and major Trump apologist Mitch McConnell penned a Washington Post op-ed that began: \u201cWithdrawing U.S. forces from Syria is a grave strategic mistake.\u201d (Ever the profile in courage, McConnell excoriated Obama in this piece numerous times, but never mentioned the architect of the current disaster by name.)\n\nTrump characterized the situation in Syria with his usual bizarre bravado. On Thursday, the White House released the text of a letter that the president wrote to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that seemed like it might have come from The Onion. It read in part: \u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don't happen. Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool. I will call you later.\u201d Erdogan reportedly tossed this missive in the trash.\n\nOn Wednesday Trump sent VP Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara to meet with Erdogan. The pair spent nine hours in Turkey and emerged with a deal they first called a cease fire, and then a five day \u201cpause.\u201d But according to CNN, a senior U.S. official said, \u201c\u2018This is essentially the U.S. validating what Turkey did and allowing them to annex a portion of Syria and displace the Kurdish population....This is what Turkey wanted and what POTUS green lighted.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the week wore on, Trump\u2019s assessment of the situation included: \u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So, there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d Along with this topographical description, he discussed his own role: \u201cIt was unconventional, what I did. I said, \u2018They\u2019re going to have to fight a little while.\u2019 Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Then people find out how tough the fighting is....It\u2019s like two kids in a lot, you\u2019ve got to let them fight and then you pull them apart. But\u2026it was pretty vicious, and the Kurds, who are our friends, and Turkey\u2019s our friend, but they fought, it was tougher, I mean, it was nasty.\u201d", "description": "Highlights from the news in Washington this week.", "authors": ["Lynn Yaeger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tK6lXQk4KhcTRMDIIQnchA--~B/aD0yOTMwO3c9NDM5NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/60e04868ecb1cf9630df46f1633d03a2", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
