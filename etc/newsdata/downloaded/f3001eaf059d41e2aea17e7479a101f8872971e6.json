God help us.\u201d\n\nCall Sign Chaos review: James Mattis pulls a flanking manuever on Trump Read more\n\nLooking back, Bloomberg got it right. But his speech wooed few beyond the convention site or the precincts of upper-income America. Instead, he reminded viewers of the ineptitude of Bill de Blasio, his successor as mayor and a 2020 presidential wannabe, and that Wall Street liked Hillary Clinton. On election day 2016, Pennsylvania, the convention\u2019s host state, went Republican for the first time in nearly 30 years. Not exactly \u201cmission accomplished\u201d.\n\nEleanor Randolph, a veteran New York Times writer, attempts to encapsulate Bloomberg\u2019s legacy. She has written a well-sourced, informative and breezy biography of one New York\u2019s greatest mayors. Indeed, it is an essential read in an era where high-end urban centers and their immediate environs are pulling away from the rest of the country. It is a tale of two Americas.\n\nSaid differently, New York and Washington DC have more in common with Palo Alto, Mountain View and Seattle than with relatively nearby Harrisburg and Scranton, Pennsylvania. In large measure, the US economy is driven by technology and finance. Bloomberg, with his computer terminals and eponymous news service, crystallizes this simultaneously dynamic and destructive force.\n\nRandolph succeeds in describing Bloomberg\u2019s successes, which are many, lasting and significant. But she comes up short in capturing the distance between him and large swathes of the citizenry. She records but does not fully delve into the cultural fissures that pockmarked the New York landscape throughout Bloomberg\u2019s time in office and became all too clear at its conclusion.\n\nBloomberg won re-election a second time in 2009 by beating Bill Thompson, a career politician and the city\u2019s comptroller, by fewer than five points and with 50.7% of the vote. In other words, it was time to go. On 1 January 2013 he did, and with him went 20 years of mayoral competence.\n\nBloomberg was well-respected but neither loved nor hated. He engendered little passion among supporters or detractors and remained culturally disconnected from middle- and working-class voters.\n\nBloomberg was well-respected but neither loved nor hated. He engendered little passion among supporters or detractors\n\nDuring a transit strike, he told residents of Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park, a scrappy outer-borough neighborhood, they ought to cycle to work. He did so standing next to a $500 bicycle, a fact recorded by Randolph. That their places of work were miles and miles away was lost on the mayor, a Johns Hopkins-trained engineer and Harvard Business School alumnus.\n\nBy contrast, the late Ed Koch, another truly great mayor, greeted pedestrians crossing the Brooklyn Bridge during an earlier strike and shamelessly asked: \u201cHow\u2019m I doing?\u201d Koch was either loved or reviled. He demanded to be buried at Trinity church \u2013 right there with Alexander Hamilton \u2013 because the churchyard contained one of the last open burial plots on Manhattan and Koch never wanted to leave.\n\nBloomberg did some very heavy lifting. He oversaw the rebuilding of the city and its economy after 9/11. Significantly, he reached into his pocket to boost such efforts. In marked contrast to Trump, he did not profiteer from the calamity and his family charity wasn\u2019t a scam filled with \u201cother people\u2019s money\u201d.\n\nBloomberg also helped forge the city\u2019s anti-terror efforts by relying upon law enforcement, data and a multilingual and multi-ethnic population. He built on Rudy Giuliani\u2019s legacy of safe streets.\n\nCrime continued to drop but he accomplished that with far less racial rancor than Rudy, even as the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d program came under attack. Bloomberg\u2019s first re-election margin handily surpassed that of Giuliani. Bloomberg beat Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, by almost 20 points.\n\nBloomberg has yearned to be president. Unlike another plutocrat, Tom Steyer, he wisely recognizes his own limitations\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Bloomberg was not the Doberman you let out at night but never let near your children. While he could be profane and ribald in private, as Randolph tells us, he endeavored to maintain a decorous veneer in public. It\u2019s no coincidence Giuliani is a Trump TV lawyer.\n\nRandolph also examines Bloomberg\u2019s efforts to raise the performance of New York public schools (mixed), attract a hi-tech campus to the city spearheaded by Cornell and Israel\u2019s Technion (an unvarnished hit) and reach out to minority communities by rightly giving a green light to charter schools. Unlike De Blasio, Bloomberg never saw virtue in sacrificing the possibility of excellence in education on the altar of political correctness. Then again, Bloomberg didn\u2019t come within a whisker of being indicted on corruption and campaign finance charges.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bloomberg speaks in Washington, in his role as United Nations special envoy for climate action.

Randolph writes of Bloomberg looking \u201cparticularly fit\u201d even after he pulled a muscle skiing on a \u201cblack diamond\u201d course after his 75th birthday. In the next breath, she describes how he \u201ctackled\u201d golf \u201cwith a passion\u201d.\n\nBloomberg has yearned to be president. But unlike another plutocrat, Tom Steyer, he wisely recognizes his own limitations. In the age of Trump, there is nothing like a pillar of the establishment to get people to trudge out in the dead of winter, to hang out for hours at the Iowa caucuses.\n\nStill, out of office does not mean out of power. In case Trump and the GOP missed it, Bloomberg was the second-largest donor in the 2018 election cycle, bested only by Sheldon Adelson, casino magnate, Trump-booster and patron of Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nAlongside his determination to fund action to meet the climate crisis, Bloomberg is reportedly ready to spend $500m to ensure that the 45th president lives at the White House for only four years. As Politico framed things: \u201cThe sum represents a floor, not a ceiling, on the billionaire\u2019s potential spending to defeat the president in 2020.\u201d\n\nRandolph lets us know Bloomberg is not easily deterred.
