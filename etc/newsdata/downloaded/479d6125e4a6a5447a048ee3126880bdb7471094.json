He said as the Attorney's General office they would analyse the admissibility of the demand but that the deciding court would be the Higher Court in Schleswig.\n\nPuigdemont was arrested under the European arrest warrant on Sunday while travelling by car on his way to Brussels from Helsinki.\n\n\"He is very calm,\" said Paul Bekaert, Carles Puigdemont's Belgian lawyer. \"I spoke to his Spanish lawyer who got him on the phone, he is very calm, very calm so for the moment we have no news.\"\n\nPuigdemont has been living in self-imposed exile in Brussels since Catalonia\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence last October.\n\nSpain is seeking his extradition on charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds.", "description": "German court has 60 days to decide on Spanish extradition request", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/11/24/39/1000x563_cmsv2_b9f6a423-7238-5799-9ed3-8bda161ba7c4-3112439.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-27"}
