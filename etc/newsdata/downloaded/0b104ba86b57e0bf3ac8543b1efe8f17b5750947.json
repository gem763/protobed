We opened several WhatsApp groups and spent more than R50 000 every week on both of them. We want independent auditors to re-audit the votes,\u201d claims someone close to the Qwabe family.\n\nThree independent sources who spoke to City Press this week claimed that the twins were leading with votes since the top 10 was announced and that Virginia\u2019s elimination came as a shock.\n\n\u201cI am adamant that the votes were rigged and that they sacrificed one twin for Nolo to win. If Nolo doesn\u2019t win, Sneziey Msomi might win this competition. Watch this space,\u201d claimed someone who has been following Idols since it started.\n\nThe source alleged that Idols was scripted and that there was much politics behind the scenes.\n\nPhilly Kubheka, head of department for PR and publicity for M-Net\u2019s local entertainment channels, told City Press yesterday that they were aware of the planned march.\n\n\u201cWe are beefing up security and involving the police to make sure there will be no disturbance to the show,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother source claimed that a few days before last week\u2019s show the Qwabe family received a tipoff from someone claiming to be from Idols production, warning them to be prepared for the worst as one of the twins was going to be eliminated.\n\nBut the Qwabes rubbished those claims as far-fetched, said the source, who failed to give us the votes. The source said it was after Virginia\u2019s elimination that the family decided there was no need for Viggy to continue, as the same could happen to her.\n\n\u201cWhen Nolo made it to top five, some family members got up and left. And as soon as the Luyolo was called, leaving the twins in the bottom two, the entire family got up and left because that\u2019s exactly how they were told it would pan out.\u201d\n\nBut Kubheka rejected claims that they already knew who the winner was, saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t true, we still have contestants in the house and they still have to perform. It\u2019s the votes that determine who will win Idols SA season 15.\u201d\n\nMzansi Magic has since denied claims that votes were rigged.\n\n\u201cMzansi Magic is satisfied as to the credibility of the Idols SA season 15 voting process. The vote count and ranking of contestants were independently computed by Deloitte and confirmed against the vote results determined by M-Net,\u201d said Kubheka.\n\nA Qwabe family member, who asked not to be named, told City Press that the twins were doing well even though they were disappointed at how things had turned out.", "description": "Angry supporters of departed Idols SA twins Viggy and Virginia Qwabe have planned a march to today\u2019s show at the SA State Theatre in Pretoria.", "authors": ["Ntombizodwa Makhoba And Moroetsana Serame"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9523/05fff47564bc4be1b5710ee10dc90cfd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
