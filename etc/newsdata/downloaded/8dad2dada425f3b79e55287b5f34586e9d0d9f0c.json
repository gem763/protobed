The tech-heavy Shenzhen composite index jumped more than one percent after Chinese state news reported Xi as saying China would boost investment in blockchain technology and speed up its development.\n\nBitcoin soared more than 15 percent to nearly $10,000 -- its highest level for a month -- before ticking back slightly.\n\nTokyo and Seoul each ended 0.3 percent higher and Sydney was marginally up. Taipei, Bangkok Jakarta and Manila were also higher.\n\nIn early trade London dipped 0.3 percent, while Paris and Frankfurt were both flat.\n\n- Eyes on Fed meeting -\n\nHowever, while the agreement would be a big positive for markets, analysts point out that it is still the first part of a wider deal that could take some time to complete.\n\nAnd Ray Attrill at National Australia Bank said: \"What's not yet clear yet is if both sides have agreed that even if the planned December 15 tariff increases won't go ahead if phase one is agreed, whether there will be any wind back of the higher tariffs imposed on September 1.\"\n\nThat issue, he said, was \"something China was said to be demanding toward the end of last week but we doubt the US is ready to concede on\".\n\nStill, the mood on trading floors is positive and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again at its latest policy meeting this week were also providing support.\n\nSterling edged up but was generally flat with focus on Westminster, where MPs will vote later in the day on whether to grant Boris Johnson a December 12 general election, which he has called for to break the Brexit deadlock.\n\nWith lawmakers refusing to pass his divorce deal before Thursday's deadline, the prime minister wants a snap poll he hopes will give him a majority of MPs who will push it through parliament.\n\nAlso Monday, EU leaders will make a decision on whether to extend the deadline to the end of January and while expectations are for Britain to leave with a deal, Attrill added: \"It's hard to see how this renewed level of uncertainty can be anything other than negative for Sterling given the size of recent gains.\"\n\n- Key figures around 0820 GMT -\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 22,867.27 (close)\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.8 percent at 26,891.26 (close)\n\nShanghai - Composite: UP 0.9 percent at 2980.05 (close)\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.3 percent at 7,303.40\n\nPound/dollar: UP at $1.2830 from $1.2823 at 2030 GMT on Friday\n\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 86.32 pence from 86.39 pence\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 108.73 yen from 108.67 yen\n\nEuro/dollar: UP at $1.1092 from $1.1079\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 22 cents at $56.44 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN 17 cents at $61.85 per barrel\n\nNew York - Dow: UP 0.6 percent at 26,958.06 (close)", "description": "Asian markets rallied Monday after China and the US said they were close to agreeing a mini trade deal, while the pound struggled to recover on fresh Brexit uncertainty while EU leaders consider extending a deadline for Britain to leave the bloc.
