It is understood Papley wishes to return home to Victoria to be closer to family.\n\nWe all know how trade time works by now.\n\nA player requests a move to a certain club, then the real stuff starts.\n\nOne club sets a price higher than their player is realistically worth, the other scoffs at their demands and the haggling starts.\n\nUsually, by an hour or so before the trade deadline, they come to a consensus about a player\u2019s true worth.\n\nThis is your chance to have a say on what your club should part with to land it's the most in-demand players of 2019.\n\nVote on more than 20 of the leading targets of the off-season below.\n\nMORE TRADE NEWS:\n\nJOE DANIHER\n\nDaniher has been linked with a move to Sydney, with the Swans holding picks five and 25. They would be likely to land another first-round pick if Tom Papley moves on.\n\nBRAD HILL\n\nThe Fremantle flyer has nominated St Kilda and the Dockers want the Saints\u2019 No. 6 pick as part of the deal. But is that price too high?\n\nSAM POWELL-PEPPER\n\nEssendon has reportedly shown interest in the Port Adelaide midfielder, while he has also been linked with a return to Western Australia. Would the Bombers pick 31 be enough?\n\nJACK MARTIN\n\nMartin was courted strongly by Western Bulldogs and Carlton but wants to join the Blues. How a deal gets done remains to be seen with Tom Papley keen to join Carlton too. The Blues\u2019 next pick after selection nine is 41.\n\nJACK STEVEN\n\nThe four-time St Kilda best-and-fairest is expected to land at Geelong. Steven only played seven games this year as he took time away from football to deal with mental health issues.\n\nJOSH JENKINS\n\nKey forward Jenkins is on the way out of Adelaide. He was linked with a big-money move to Brisbane Lions in 2016 but is expected to join a Victorian club this time around.\n\nTOM PAPLEY\n\nTom Papley wants to be a Blue. How he gets there is another matter. Carlton has pick 9 in this year\u2019s draft but then doesn\u2019t have a second rounder if Sydney demands a bounty for the contracted goalkicker.\n\nZAK JONES\n\nJones has been blistering at his best but has lacked consistency during his time as a Swan. He\u2019s tipped to be one of the new faces at Moorabbin next year, but Brad Hill will be the Saints\u2019 priority. The Saints\u2019 next pick after No. 6 is No. 57.\n\nED LANGDON\n\nThe Dockers wingman will get to Melbourne, with pick 22 a likely starting point in negotiations. The Demons have pick 40 in the third round, but might want a selection back if they send two picks west.\n\nALEX KEATH\n\nCrows key defender Keath has asked to become a Western Bulldog and don\u2019t be surprised if Adelaide starts negotiations with pick No. 13. If pick No. 32 heads to St Kilda for Josh Bruce, the Crows will likely have to settle for a future second-rounder.\n\nTIM KELLY\n\nThe Herald Sun revealed on September 5 Kelly would request a trade to Western Australia, which is expected to become official in the first week of October. Whether West Coast can satisfy Geelong remains to be seen.\n\nBRAD CROUCH\n\nHas insisted he wants to stay in Adelaide, but the rumours Gold Coast is interested in the prolific, but injury-prone Crows on-baller persist.\n\nPADDY RYDER\n\nThe veteran ruckman weighed up a return to Essendon before settling on St Kilda. It might take a future pick to get him to Moorabbin if the club passes Western Bulldogs\u2019 No. 32 selection to Sydney for Zak Jones.\n\nEDDIE BETTS\n\nSmall forward has his heart set on a return to Carlton after being squeezed out at Adelaide. He kicked 37 goals this year but at 32 years old the Blues won\u2019t be willing to pay much in the form of a trade.\n\nJOSH BRUCE\n\nThe Saints forward is tipped to cross to Whitten Oval on a long-term deal and will partner Aaron Naughton in attack for the Bulldogs.\n\nHUGH GREENWOOD\n\nGreenwood fielded offers from Victoria and both Queensland clubs and appears certain to join Gold Coast. The Suns need midfield experience and he\u2019ll add a tougher edge to Gold Coast.\n\nSAM JACOBS\n\nThe Crows big man won his spot back late in the season but Reilly O\u2019Brien is the long-term ruckman in Adelaide. He\u2019s joining GWS, but at what price?\n\nDARCY CAMERON\n\nStuck behind Sam Naismith and Callum Sinclair in Sydney, Cameron is keen to partner Brodie Grundy and show his wares as a forward with Collingwood.\n\nJON PATTON\n\nThe injury-plagued forward has nominated Hawthorn as his preferred home for 2020 and pick No. 47 seems a fair deal. But will it be enough for the Giants?\n\nORAZIO FANTASIA\n\nWas first linked with a return to South Australia mid-year and despite denials from player and club the talk remains. Will the Power make a play?\n\nSAM FROST\n\nThe defender finished top-10 in Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest, but the Dees are reportedly prepared to deal as they plan for the return of Steven May and Jake Lever. Will Frost be another Hawks steal?", "description": "We all know how trade time works by now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b487b8e3f60ba20f877fc2e88cf324e8?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
