Secondly, he\u2019s got a great record.\n\n\u201cSuper Rugby with the Crusaders when we first started coaching against each other, followed by Wales, followed by New Zealand. You don\u2019t get a better record than that.\n\nJones said it was rugby\u2019s culture of \u201crespectful relationships\u201d that set it apart from other codes.\n\n\u201cYou just have to see this tournament to know what it\u2019s done because the things that have happened don\u2019t happen in other sports.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the Canadian and Namibian blokes cleaning up the ground (after their pool match in Kamaishi was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis).\n\n\u201cCould you imagine Ronaldo or Messi doing that if Barcelona or Real Madrid gets a wash?\u201d\n\nHansen was equally complimentary about Jones\u2019s work in transforming an England side who suffered an embarrassing first-round exit on home soil at the 2015 World Cup into genuine title contenders four years later.\n\n\u201cEddie\u2019s done a fantastic job with England \u2014 they\u2019ve got a harder edge about them now,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\u201cEddie\u2019s been part of a winning World Cup team with South Africa (2007), he\u2019s had the disappointment of losing to England when he was coaching Australia (2003) but to get to the final is being successful anyway.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Loves the game\u2019 \u2013\n\nHansen, in a reference to the stroke Jones suffered six years ago when in charge of Japan, added: \u201cI respect his passion for the game \u2014 he loves the game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a work ethic second to none. He put himself in hospital, he\u2019d worked that hard. He just loves the game and anyone who loves the game gets my support.\u201d\n\nHansen said the verbal sparring that went on between opposing coaches should not be taken too seriously\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of footy, it\u2019s not life or death. It\u2019s like when you play against your brother or sister. It\u2019s important, but it\u2019s not life threatening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely closer than you guys (the media) perceive. You see some of the banter which is really only to help promote the game as being \u2018cor, these guys don\u2019t like each other\u2019, which couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRugby\u2019s a special game and those of us who have been around for long enough understand that the game is bigger than everybody else.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones contrasted what he said was rugby's down to earth attitude with that of football superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/d8d29dbdd7ec0561c13532a493cd4733.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
