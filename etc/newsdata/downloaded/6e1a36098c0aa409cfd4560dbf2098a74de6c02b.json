It is - but we're having Christmas now.\"\n\n(Image: plymouthherald.co.uk)\n\nMike said it's accepted that it is unlikely Oliver will see Christmas.\n\nOliver developed the rare disease aged eight as a result of a complicated genetic disorder relating to his GATA2 gene, which also resulted in Oliver being born deaf.\n\nFor the last few months his parents, Mike and Nicky, along with his younger brother Benjamin, have been creating special memories and filling their days with happy activities - from days out with friends and family and occasional trips to school to see schoolmates to being made a cop thanks to Devon and Cornwall Police.\n\nThe family would usually put up the decorations on December 1 and get \"a good run\".\n\nMike added: \"We decided to bring it forward for him and Benjamin, to enjoy together. In our minds he made it to Christmas 2019.\n\n\"He loves Christmas, so it's the right thing for us all.\"\n\n(Image: plymouthherald.co.uk)\n\nIn a poignant twist, Mike said it was clear the family should do the right thing and forget any traditional conventions following one incident earlier this year.\n\nHe said: \"Oliver put on the Arthur Christmas film in August or September and as I walked past him and Benjamin watching it I said it was bad luck to do Christmas when it wasn't December.\n\n\"Benjamin turned around and just said 'we can't get much more bad luck Dad'.\n\n\"He's right and I just thought you guys crack on. So it's Christmas and we're all going to enjoy it.\"", "description": "Oliver's dad said: \"In our minds he made it to Christmas 2019\"", "authors": ["Carl Eve", "Grace Witherden", "Image", "Plymouthherald.Co.Uk"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_261019Slug_11251JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
