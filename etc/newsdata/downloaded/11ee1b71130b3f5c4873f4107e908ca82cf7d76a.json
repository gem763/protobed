To put it mildly.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAlso there is Steven Adams, a quality big man who can bring defense, rebounding, a few points, and physicality to a team. He has two years, $53.3 million total on his contract, but that\u2019s not what is scaring teams off right now, it\u2019s the high asking price, reports Sean Deveney of Heavy.com.\n\nSources told Heavy.com that the Thunder are seeking a draft pick, a young player and salary relief for Adams. \u201cThey set the price too high,\u201d one league executive said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019d expect and maybe it will drop as the year goes on. It\u2019s tough to take on his contract (two years, $53 million remaining) and give up picks and players. Most teams are pretty well set at the center spot now, you have a big guy and you have your small lineup. You can\u2019t just take on a contract like that. There isn\u2019t a big number of teams who could take him.\u201d\n\nThat last line is critical \u2014 Adams is an old-school center, and those kinds of players are in far less demand now as the NBA evolves to a space-and-pace league. Not a lot of teams are looking for a center in the mold of Adams, and the ones that could use him look at the price tag \u2014 both what they\u2019d have to give up and his salary the next two seasons \u2014 and balk. Deveney points to the Kings as an example, they had some trade talks for Adams but it didn\u2019t go far, then they signed Dewayne Dedmon to a three-year, $40 million contract. They found what they see as a better value.\n\nThings will change. As the season moves along and teams assess their needs, and as the Thunder bring their asking price down, it\u2019s likely trade talks will heat up around Adams again. Whether they can move him before next summer remains to be seen, but if he can up his scoring with Russell Westbrook and James Harden gone, it will help his cause.", "description": "Adams is an old-school center with a has two years, $53.3 million total remaining on his contract.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VdQn.zdR2LNRkNFM1ts86Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgxNjtoPTQ2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bi7tObfFXl1zF8ZdzvS5Zg--~B/aD0yMzA7dz00MDg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/8ded4ab171c5294b0fd221bbd1704fe0"}
