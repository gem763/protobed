Rees-Mogg was criticised by Caroline Lucas for lounging on the benches of the Commons during a debate. \u201cThe leader of the house has been spread across three seats, lying out as if that was something very boring for him to listen to tonight,\u201d she said.\n\n'It will follow him for years': how Jacob Rees-Mogg's slouch gambit backfired Read more\n\nSoames called Rees-Mogg an \u201cabsolute fraud\u201d who is \u201ca living example of what a moderately cut double-breasted suit and a decent tie can do with an ultra-posh voice\u201d.\n\nHe also spoke about his concerns for the future of his party, saying that he feared a schism, with many liberal Conservatives turning their backs on the \u201cvery hard-right Tory\u201d version of the party that is taking shape under Johnson.\n\nThe former defence minister predicted that further Tory MPs would follow the lead of Jo Johnson, who quit this past week \u2013 citing conflict between family loyalty and the public interest \u2013 if they were forced to sign up to campaigning for a no-deal Brexit during any general election push.\n\nHe also expected hardcore no-deal Brexiters to turn on Johnson if he attempted to push through an agreement with the EU, by tweaking the withdrawal agreement. \u201cIt is a tragedy that we are going to be potentially sunk on the altar of something so fundamentally un-Tory,\u201d he said.", "description": "Expelled party rebel also attacked Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership and called Jacob Rees-Mogg a \u2018fraud\u2019", "authors": ["Lanre Bakare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4693793b18834c729a94080b04930c1c54bfa6cf/0_0_3943_2365/master/3943.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e126418e57c500be5d830cc489dff333", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
