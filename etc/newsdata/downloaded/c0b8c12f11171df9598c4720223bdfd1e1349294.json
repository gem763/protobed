A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the agency to turn over the documents by the beginning of the month.\n\nAccording to Justice Department attorney Courtney Enlow there are more than 800 witness interview transcripts, called 302 forms, that total around 44,000 pages. The pages will contain information from key Trump campaign and White House officials as well as those not affiliated with the federal government.\n\nEnlow said the agency will have to review every page, line-by-line, to determine what can be released. They will have to determine if information could have national security implications or expose ongoing prosecutions and investigations.\n\nThe DOJ suggested releasing 500 pages per month until all documents are released. Judge Reggie B. Walton, however, said it would take years for the entire interview transcripts to make it into the American public's hands, something he believes defeats the purpose of the FOIA process.\n\n\"Otherwise, they're just totally thumbing their nose at the objective of FOIA,\" Walton said. \"The American public is going to become totally disillusioned.\"\n\nThe same judge plans to issue a ruling on whether or not the full Mueller report can be released without any redactions. He anticipates making a decision next month.\n\nMueller wrapped up his investigation in March. He submitted a 488-page document to the Department of Justice and Attorney General William Barr released a four page summary of Mueller's findings. Mueller found no collusion took place but declined to determine whether or not obstruction took place.", "description": "Hmm..10/02/2019 8:44:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/205/625465fe-2176-4b5e-ab40-91a5050f85b0.png"}
