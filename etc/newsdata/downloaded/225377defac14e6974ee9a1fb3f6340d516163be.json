You bet it was \u2013 and in first-half stoppage time, Hudson-Odoi ran half the length of the pitch before picking his spot in the top corner from 25 yards.\n\nInevitably, after such a rampant first half, England could not sustain the one-way traffic, and Christoph Baumgartner's header after 66 minutes gave the Austrians respite from their torture.\n\nBut Nketiah completed his treble from sub Rhian Brewster's cross and was denied a fourth from the penalty spot by Fabian Ehmann's sprawling save six minutes from time.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nArsenal striker Nketiah has yet to start a Championship game on loan at Elland Road, buthas scored six goals in his last four international appearances and Boothroyd insisted: \u201cHe is in a brilliant place, learning off a great coach and when he comes to us he is ready and fresh.\u201d\n\nBoothroyd, to his credit, sees the bigger picture beyond his side's 100 per cent record, saying: \u201cI've said it many times before, but the Under-21s is like a paradox really.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, we've got to produce players for Gareth and the senior team, which is always the priority.\n\n\"But with the players and the depth that we've got, we're expected to win as well.\u201d\n\nPlayer Ratings\n\nENGLAND (3-5-2): Ramsdale 6; Justin 6, Kelly 7, Guehi 7; Aarons 7 (Sessegnon, 61, 6), Davies 6, Foden 8, Willock 7 (Skipp, 74), McNeil 7 (Brewster, 61, 6); Hudson-Odoi 8 (Gallagher, 86), Nketiah 8 (Surridge, 86).\n\nAUSTRIA (4-3-3): Ehmann 7; Malicsek 5, Danso 5, Maresic 5, Friedl 5; Lovric 5 (Halper, 80), Demaku 5 (Muller, 69, 5); Baumgartner 6, Raguz 5 (Schmidt, 69, 5), Meister 5 (Lema, 80); Arase 5 (Grull, 53, 6).", "description": "ENGLAND U21S 5-1 AUSTRIA U21s: Chelsea whizkid Hudson-Odoi was in unstoppable form at Stadium:mk", "authors": ["Mike Walters", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20587680.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-U21-v-Austria-U21-UEFA-Under-21-Championship-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
