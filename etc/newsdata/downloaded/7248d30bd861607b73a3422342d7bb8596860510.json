Photo: Jim Spellman/FilmMagic\n\nWhen was the last time you saw Lenny Kravitz without sunglasses? Years? Decades? The man even posed for this 2018 Hollywood Reporter spread \u2026 wearing sunglasses \u2026 indoors. It\u2019s like seeing a brunette Reese Witherspoon \u2014 it simply isn\u2019t right! So, it\u2019s obvious then why he would resort to a Twitter APB to find a beloved pair of lost shades. The musician/legend/father to a legend tweeted that he lost a vital pair at his concert at The Shrine in Los Angeles Sunday night. \u201cThey are incredibly sentimental to me, they are vintage and they belonged to a family member,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHoping to get them back, no questions asked.\u201d Persons with any information regarding the glasses can reach out to him at a specific hotline: kravitzglasses@gmail.com. You gotta respect Kravitz\u2019s faith in humanity that he thinks he\u2019ll actually receive helpful tips and not nudes. But listen, haven\u2019t we all ended up home after a crazy night missing something wholly necessary like a necklace or keys or a sense of self? Help a brother out!\n\nI\u2019m missing this pair of sunglasses after my show in LA at the Shrine this weekend. They are incredibly sentimental to me, they are vintage and they belonged to a family member. Hoping to get them back, no questions asked.
