It ended in relegation from the Premier League.\n\nGareth Southgate was perhaps the right manager at the wrong time for Middlesbrough\n\nCould it be that Jonathan Woodgate is the right manager at the wrong time as well?\n\nSound familiar? Thirteen years on and Jonathan Woodgate - another fine England centre-half - has been served the same brief as Southgate, except his is a more extreme task.\n\nWoodgate was afforded just five new players in his first summer in management, at a cost of around \u00a34million.\n\nTo put that figure into context, the club spent \u00a366m in attempting to win immediate promotion following demotion to the Championship in 2017. They finished fifth and were beaten in the play-off semi-finals - they had gambled and lost.\n\nIt is Woodgate, though, who is now counting the cost and, to no great surprise, he has seen his side struggle.\n\nThe austerity imposed by owner Steve Gibson - a necessary measure given two seasons spent shooting for the Premier League - has lowered expectations accordingly and, with it, eased pressure on the new boss. Gibson has stated he will be sticking by Woodgate.\n\nThere are, however, some observers who believe this squad should still have enough to be better than fifth from bottom, just two points above the drop zone.\n\nWoodgate has been served an extreme task, to slash the wage bill and invest in the youth\n\nBoro have won twice all season and are yet to score more than one goal in a game at the Riverside, where last time out the attendance was just under 18,000, a fall of 4,000 since the start of the campaign.\n\nA relative avalanche of goals during a 3-3 draw at Luton on the opening weekend gave the false illusion of a team ready to play on the front foot and entertain. What has unfolded since has been far from pleasant on the eye.\n\nWoodgate's first win - 1-0 at home to Wigan in August - caused the boss to reflect: 'The Championship is a grind. It wasn't the greatest spectacle but it's three points and we needed them.\n\n'This is a work in progress and it's going to be a rocky road. We need the fans to stay with us and they did that tonight.' The manager's message has remained the same during a subsequent two-month period which has brought six points from a possible 21.\n\nThey were beaten 2-1 at Birmingham before the international break with a performance on live television that saw them repeatedly cut open at the back and offer precious little at the other end.\n\nIt has long been the case that Boro have found inspiration hard to come by in the final third, but when you combine that with a leaky backline that was previously watertight then there is serious cause for concern.\n\nBoro have won twice all season and are yet to score more than one goal in a game at home\n\nThe flash interview on full-time at St Andrew's was just as uncomfortable as the previous 90 minutes for Woodgate as he was asked if he is capable of turning around their sticky situation. He was also warned Boro would get 'murdered' if his side played like that in the coming weeks.\n\nWoodgate, to his credit, maintained his composure, much like he always did on the football pitch. There is an admirable calmness to the 39-year-old, and he will need that if their chaotic slide continues.\n\nHe had, however, torn into his players in the dressing-room and was alarmed at how easy they were to penetrate.\n\nWoodgate must take some blame for how he sets his team up - it is, after all, his job to motivate and organise them - but the players have let him down in recent weeks. They can't come out and tell the world how much they're enjoying life under the affable coach only to then put in a miserable performance on a match-day.\n\nIn their current state, perhaps the last thing they need this weekend is the visit of league leaders West Brom.\n\nThere is a suspicion that things could get worse before they get better at Middlesbrough\n\nThere is a strong suspicion that things could get worse before they get better and, to that end, patience will be key in maintaining sanity. Woodgate has asked for it and, at least from his owner and the majority of supporters, he will get it.\n\nFor now, the passing and attacking ideals he spoke about during his summer unveiling will have to wait. Boro are in a very real scrap at the wrong end of the Championship and Woodgate is fighting, if not for his immediate future, then to prove he has a long-term one at his boyhood club.\n\nBut circumstance has not been kind.
