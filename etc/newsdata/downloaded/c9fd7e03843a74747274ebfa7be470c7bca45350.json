That\u2019s according to a new report from Space Angels, an investment firm focused on the space industry, which quantified how much money government agencies have invested in private aerospace firms over the last 18 years.\n\nThe analysis reveals just how important a role the government still plays in the private space industry. It found that early public investment can sometimes be the difference between life and death for a company. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for people to recognize that it isn\u2019t just the private sector deciding to do something,\u201d Chad Anderson, CEO of Space Angels, tells The Verge. \u201cThe government has played a key role in the development of entrepreneurial space companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government has played a key role in the development of entrepreneurial space companies.\u201d\n\nSpace Angels made the report at the request of NASA, as the agency wanted to know just how its investments over the last couple of decades have affected the private sector. Ultimately, Space Angels found that 67 space companies received a total of $7.2 billion in investments from the government between 2000 and 2018. And about 93 percent of that investment went into companies dedicated to launching rockets. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cGovernment funding has been directed at reducing the barriers to entry, and the biggest barrier in the beginning is launch.\u201d\n\nThe report highlights SpaceX as a prime example of how early government investment contributed to the success of a company. During its first decade of operation, SpaceX operated off of $1 billion, and about half of that money came from government contracts from NASA, according to the Space Angels report. Musk notably thanked NASA for the agency\u2019s support after SpaceX launched its very first Dragon cargo capsule to the International Space Station in 2012. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do this alone,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have done it without the help of NASA.\u201d\n\nThe total value of U.S. public funding received by entrepreneurial space companies from 2000 through 2018 was $7.2B across 67 companies.

Space Angels estimates there are 375 companies within the private space industry, which have received a combined $19 billion in private funding since 2009. And there are at least 123 companies that have registered for a DUNS number \u2014 a requirement for getting public funding \u2014 but have yet to get government investment. Anderson notes that there are downsides to working with the government, which is why some may not pursue such partnerships. Among other issues, DOD or NASA requirements might be too cumbersome for a small company, or the goals of government programs could take resources away from a startup\u2019s focus.\n\nHowever, the report focuses on many of the government investment programs that have worked the best, such as NASA and the Department of Defense\u2019s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) initiatives. Both SBIR and STTR have given money to small entrepreneurial companies in their earliest stages and as a result, these businesses have attracted additional private investment. \u201cThis is helping us steer us towards program and funding mechanisms that really work,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cSo let\u2019s use this data to help influence policy and help influence funding decisions at NASA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is helping us steer us towards program and funding mechanisms that really work.\u201d\n\nAnderson argues that since most NASA and DOD investments have gone to launch-focused companies up until now, it may be time for these agencies to branch out more into other areas of space business. He notes that we are seeing some of that with NASA\u2019s CLPS program, which just awarded contracts to three private space companies building robotic spacecraft that can take instruments to the surface of the Moon. Anderson argues that this is a prime example of how the government can jump-start new models of business that don\u2019t have a very clear way of making money yet. \u201cThe government plays a larger role in new markets where there\u2019s not as much economic incentive,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cAnd then once that economic incentive starts to develop, that\u2019s when the private sector can come in and take over.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, Space Angels makes the case that if you\u2019re going to work in space, you\u2019re going to cross paths with the public sector at some point. So getting investment from the government may be in a company\u2019s best interest. \u201cYou can\u2019t do business in space without the government,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThey\u2019re involved in some way or another.\u201d", "description": "Early investments from a government agency, like NASA or the Air Force, can be a crucial step in the evolution of commercial space companies from scrappy startups to successful businesses.
