Bill Clinton did. And Donald Trump could be next.\n\nA common thread running through all three imperiled presidencies?\n\nHillary Clinton.\n\nIn the 243-year history of the republic, just four U.S. presidents have faced impeachment inquiries. In a bizarre plot twist that reads like bad fiction, Clinton \u2013 a former first lady, senator, secretary of State and almost-president \u2013 is connected to three of them.\n\n\u201cYou cannot make my life up. Really,\u201d Clinton joked recently with television host Stephen Colbert about her strange ties to the impeachment cases against the 37th, 42nd and 45th presidents.\n\nClinton was still known as Hillary Rodham when, fresh out of Yale Law School, she was hired by the House Judiciary Committee to work on the impeachment case against Nixon during the Watergate scandal. The memo they produced is an official government document and is still relevant today in large part because it helps define what is considered an impeachable offense.\n\nTwo decades later, Clinton was America\u2019s first lady, literally standing by her man, President Bill Clinton, in the White House Rose Garden, nodding her head in agreement as he decried \u201cthe poisonous venom of excessive partisanship\u201d following his impeachment in 1998.\n\nTwo decades after that, Hillary Clinton would run for president herself and win the popular vote but lose the Electoral College \u2013 and the presidency \u2013 to Trump, who is now facing an impeachment inquiry amid accusations that he pressured a foreign power to investigate a political adversary, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nImpeaching Trump: Republicans condemn impeachment proceedings in resolution\n\nHillary Clinton listens during a lecture on foreign policy at Rackham Auditorium, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019 in Ann Arbor, Mich. More\n\nClinton\u2019s office declined to comment for this article.\n\nBut Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on presidential impeachment, described Clinton\u2019s connection to impeachment proceedings against three presidents as \u201can odd coincidence\u201d and \u201ca testament to Hillary Clinton\u2019s longevity as part of the national political life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a part of (the impeachment story),\u201d Bowman said, \u201cbut that\u2019s because she has been a part of the national story for so long.\u201d\n\n'Impeachment ... is a very big thing'\n\nBefore Watergate in the early 1970s \u2013 a scandal that would eventually end Nixon's presidency \u2013 no American president had faced impeachment since Andrew Johnson a century earlier.\n\nAmid Watergate, with impeachment no longer a constitutional relic but a real possibility, the House Judiciary Committee tapped Clinton and a bipartisan team of young staffers to research the history of impeachment and explore possible grounds for impeaching Nixon.\n\n\u201cThe staff and members of the House understood that considering the impeachment of a president is a very big thing, and they wanted to make sure they understood the history and the law,\u201d said Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and expert on impeachment.\n\nClinton and others on the bipartisan team produced a 64-page memo detailing the origins of impeachment dating to the British Parliament more than 400 years ago and the constitutional grounds that would be needed to impeach an American president.\n\nAmong their conclusions: Criminal conduct is not needed to satisfy the definition of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d one of the thresholds the U.S. Constitution spells out for impeachment of a public officeholder.\n\nThe 1974 memo \u201cis a tremendous piece of work,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much contribution Secretary Clinton had to that work, but given its length, I think it really covers the ground nicely. And I very much agree with almost all of its conclusions, particularly its conclusion about the kinds of things that are impeachable.\u201d", "description": "Hillary Clinton wrote the book, or at least a memo, on impeachment.
