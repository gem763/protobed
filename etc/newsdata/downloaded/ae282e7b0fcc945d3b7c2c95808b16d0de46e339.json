If you\u2019ve tried it you may have found it\u2019s slow, grinding and frustrating. Lose three pounds. Gain two. Repeat.\n\nBut 32% of the population are overweight and another 40% are actually obese. And shedding the pounds is great for your health, as well as your self-esteem.\n\nRecent research suggests that Americans are not getting the message that they need to change their eating habits.\n\nU.S. diets are too reliant on food that contributes to heart disease and obesity, according to a study published last month in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the eating habits of 44,000 people gleaned from government-health surveys from 1999 to 2016.\n\nThe good news? You can cheat at dieting, sort of.\n\nEverybody who\u2019s looked at those little screens in their office elevator knows there is a new scientific study every day that overturns the one from yesterday. Everything that used to be good for you might be bad for you, and vice-versa.\n\nBut, subject to that, here are 10 hacks, tricks or work-arounds that, according to scientific research, may help you if you\u2019re struggling.\n\n1. Weigh yourself every day\n\nResearchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing and University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine tracked 1,042 middle-aged adults over the course of a year. They presented the results to the American Heart Association last fall. In a nutshell: Just the act of weighing yourself every day helps weight loss. Participants who never weighed themselves, or weighed themselves only once a week, ended up losing no weight over the twelve months.\n\nThose who weighed themselves every day lost nearly 2% of their body weight. No, it\u2019s not magic, say researchers. Monitoring your weight daily keeps you aware of what you\u2019re eating, and how much you\u2019re exercising, and how that is affecting your waistline in real time. \u201cGet a scale,\u201d says David Levitsky, a nutrition expert and professor of human ecology at Cornell University. \u201cPut it right next to your bed, and weigh yourself every day.\u201d\n\n2. Keep a food diary\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether you\u2019re using a notebook or a smartphone app, say researchers. What matters is making sure you record every single thing you eat every day. A recent study by Duke University found that people who tracked their daily food intake lost a healthy six pounds on average in three months, regardless of what diet they chose to follow. This follows a Kaiser Permanente study that suggested keeping a daily food diary could double the average weight loss.\n\n3. Go to bed earlier\n\nStruggling to shed the fat? Try getting more sleep. Ten overweight, middle-aged people took part in this experiment at the University of Chicago\u2019s Sleep Research Laboratory. Over a two-week period, each participant ate a strict, balanced, calorie-controlled diet and got a healthy seven and a half hours sleep per night. In another two-week period, each participant ate the same diet, but only got about five and a quarter hours sleep per night. The result? In both cases they lost about the same amount of weight, around six pounds.\n\nBut when they got a good night\u2019s sleep they ended up losing twice as much body fat as when they didn\u2019t. When they were sleep-deprived, most of the weight loss was muscle. Scientists now believe skipping on sleep can change your body\u2019s production of certain hormones, making you feel hungrier and causing you to store more fat.\n\n4. Wear earplugs at night\n\nMaybe. But this isn\u2019t totally crazy. That\u2019s because it\u2019s not enough to get enough sleep. You also want to get good sleep. Some studies, including this one conducted in Switzerland, have found there may be a connection between the amount of traffic noise near your home and long-term weight gain. One likely reason, say researchers: The noise may be interrupting your sleep, and either waking you up during the night, or preventing you from getting enough of the \u201cdeep\u201d sleep your body really needs. So if you live near a busy road, or on the flight path for an airport, earplugs may help your diet by helping your sleep.\n\n5. Skip a meal a day\n\nThis one trick can sharply reduce your overall calorie count, say researchers. Why? Because we don\u2019t make up for the lost calories during the rest of the day. \u201cWhen you examine the literature critically, you find that we don\u2019t compensate,\u201d says David Levitsky, professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University. \u201cWhen you skip breakfast, at lunch you may eat a little bit more, but you don\u2019t make up the calories.\u201d You might skip breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\n6. Fast for two days a week\n\nBritish doctor Michael Mosley sparked a massive dieting wave seven years ago when he launched the so-called \u201cFast Diet.\u201d It\u2019s better known as the \u201c5:2\u201d diet, because it involves eating normally five days a week, and eating very little for the other two. Someresearch, as well as plenty of anecdotes, say it works. Other research suggests it may be no better for weight loss than regular diets.\n\nBut, says Cornell\u2019s professor Levitsky, it may work for the same reason skipping a meal does: It may simply be a convenient way of reducing calories. During the days when you eat normally, you probably won\u2019t make up for all the calories skipped on the days you fast. And, say many fans, it is easier to fast two days a week than to count calories obsessively for all seven.\n\n7. Buy smaller plates\n\nIf this sounds silly, think again. Several years ago, researchers at Cornell University sent out free tableware to more than 300 families in the Syracuse, New York area. Half the families got small plates. The other half got big plates. The result? Over four months, those who got the smaller plates lost nearly three pounds more, on average, than the others. The small-plate theory is controversial. Some studies have found that smaller plates cause us to eat smaller portions. Other studies have questioned that. But a recent survey of more than fifty such studies concluded that smaller plates really do work, and persuade us to eat less. How easy is that?\n\n8. Drink water before every meal\n\nResearchers at the University of Birmingham in England recruited 84 obese adults to a 12-week study. About half the participants drank half a liter of water half an hour before every meal. The other half didn\u2019t. The result? Those who drank the water lost about four pounds more than those who didn\u2019t. If it sounds too simple to be true, think again. The water stretches the stomach and tricks your brain into thinking you\u2019re fuller than you really are, say researchers.\n\n9. Get some support\n\nMaybe it just involves going to a weekly Weight Watchers US:WTW meeting. Or maybe it\u2019s getting regular counseling, or having regular meetings with a nutritionist. A recent survey of nearly 100 weight loss programs by the U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce, a medical team supported by the federal government, found that this kind of support structure is a key factor for success when trying to lose weight. Those who attend regular meetings are more likely to lose the weight and keep it off.\n\n10. Find healthy foods you love\n\nIf your diet is all about denial and going without, no wonder it\u2019s such hard work. \u201cCounting calories is not what\u2019s going to stick in the long run,\u201d says Sally Willis-Stewart, a health and nutrition expert at the University of British Columbia in Canada. \u201cAs soon as we restrict something, people feel deprived.\u201d If you want to lose weight and keep it off, she says, healthy eating needs to be fun and enjoyable. That\u2019s essential.
