Young prison officers are coming straight from university, with very little life experience.\n\n\"They have to deal with major traumatic events like somebody dying in front of them.\"\n\nTougher prison sentences and historic sex cases are partly to blame.\n\nDr Mary Turner, reader in health services research at Huddersfield University, told the BBC: \"People tend to get longer sentences, even in older age, than they might have done in the past.\n\n\"There are more older people going into prison than there are being released.\"\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\nSecure care homes, and alternatives to prison may be part of the solution.\n\nInspector of Prison Peter Clarke warned the number of men over 50 being held would rise to 14,000 by 2022, around 17 percent of the prison population.\n\n\"When prisoners get older, less capable physically or infirm, they don't provide an escape risk,\" he said.\n\n\"They still have to be held in custody very often and it's not to say they wouldn't present a risk to the public if they were completely at liberty.\n\n\"The question is do they need to be held in levels of security which are not needed for their physical capabilities and which inevitably are very expensive as well?\"\n\n\n\nThe Prison Service is working closely with local councils and healthcare providers to make sure the needs of elderly prisoners are being met.\n\n\u201cLast year, a Chief Inspector of Prisons report found there was good work to adapt prisons for older inmates. We updated guidance for governors,\" said a spokesman.\n\n\n\nLocal authorities are responsible for assessing and meeting eligible social care and support needs of adult prisoners detained in their area.", "description": "Ralph Clarke was sentenced to a 13-year term for historic child sex attacks in 2016 at the age of 101", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Image", "Birmingham Mail", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20688097.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS89375620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
