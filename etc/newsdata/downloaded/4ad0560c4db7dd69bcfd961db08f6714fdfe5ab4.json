They gave birth to 29 children who were adopted by families in Arizona and other states including Utah.\n\nPHOTO: This undated booking photo provided by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office shows County Assessor Paul Petersen.

He said that since news of the case initially broke late Tuesday night, the Utah Attorney General\u2019s Office received in excess of 30 calls from potential victims who had not been previously identified, suggesting that more charges could come later.\n\nBoth Petersen and Jennet were arrested Tuesday and booked into Maricopa County Jail. ABC News' attempts to reach them were not immediately successful.\n\nQuestions were raised about Petersen's law firm's adoption practices in December 2018 following an investigation by the Honolulu Civil Beat. At the time, Petersen issued a statement to The Arizona Republic saying that he was \"extremely proud\" of the work his firm did.\n\n\"My work is personally rewarding as I have helped hundreds of couples trying to adopt children,\" Petersen said in a statement to The Arizona Republic in December 2018. \"I only work with children who are United States citizens. I follow closely the laws of the states I work in and adhere to federal rules and guidelines that govern adoptions.\"\n\n\"I will continue doing the work that I love and enrich the lives of numerous families,\" Petersen said.", "description": "A local official in Arizona has been arrested and charged in connection with an adoption ring.
