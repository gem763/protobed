Mandatory Credit: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports\n\n(Reuters) - World champion Nathan Chen claimed his third consecutive victory at the Skate America Grand Prix in Las Vegas on Saturday by putting on a clinic in the free skate.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, skating to music by Elton John, earned a prolonged standing ovation from the adoring crowd after his flawless performance.\n\nHe did not receive any deductions and posted a technical score of 102.38, together with a presentation mark of 94.\n\nAdding to his score from the short program, Chen recorded a total of 299.09, finishing 45 points clear of the runnerup, fellow American Jason Brown.\n\nDespite his runaway win, Chen kept his feet on the ground afterwards, unlike during much of his performance on the ice.\n\n\u201cMost programs I make mistakes, so there are a few things I want to clean up, continue developing the programs as much as I can,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nEarlier in the pairs competition, Chinese duo Cheng Peng and Yang Jin scored their first ISU Grand Prix victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve won several silver medals and we\u2019ve been longing for a gold medal,\u201d Peng said.\n\n\u201cWe put in a lot of effort and this gold medal is like a new starting point for us and will push us further. Hopefully we\u2019ll win many more.\u201d", "description": "World champion Nathan Chen claimed his third consecutive victory at the Skate America Grand Prix in Las Vegas on Saturday by putting on a clinic in the free skate.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442842375&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J00O-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
