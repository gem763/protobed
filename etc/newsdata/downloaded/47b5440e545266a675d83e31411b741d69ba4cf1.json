If it was heard at all, it was a whimper, not a bang. Howard, we hardly knew ye.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to the fanfare that greeted the former Starbucks CEO when he announced his still-prospective third-party candidacy back in January on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Schultz candidacy, which for all practical purposes died aborning, was predicated on there being a large, moderate plurality of voters who would be receptive to an alternative to the two major parties, which are moving increasingly to their ideological bases.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true of the Democrats, whose presidential hopefuls in their monthly debates are falling all over one another to see who can scramble furthest and fastest to the far left.\n\nBut belying Mr. Schultz\u2019s assertion that he was trying to provide voters with a \u201cmoderate\u201d alternative to the two major parties, he made it clear he was ending his campaign out of mortal dread that his third-party candidacy would only ensure President Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cTrump must not serve a second term,\u201d Mr. Schultz harrumphed. \u201cNo one wants Donald Trump fired more than I.\u201d\n\nMr. Schultz apparently has no comparable qualms about the prospect of the election of a far-left Democrat as president, because there were certainly no \u201cmoderates\u201d on the debate stage in Houston on Sept. 12.\n\nThe barista-in-chief bowed both to political reality and to Democrats\u2019 demands that he drop out of the race for fear of siphoning off votes of registered Democrats who don\u2019t like Mr. Trump, but also don\u2019t like any of the Democrats running.\n\nHad Mr. Schultz been genuinely interested in offering himself up as a moderating force in presidential politics, after ending his independent bid, he could have jumped into the Democratic field.\n\nThere\u2019s still time for him to do so before the next Democratic debate on Oct. 15.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Trump Republican presidential wannabes former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Reps. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Joe Walsh of Illinois would do well to follow Mr. Schultz onto the sidelines, albeit for the opposite reason.\n\nWith polls of Republican voters showing Mr. Trump with 80-plus percent job approval, there\u2019s less-than-zero chance of any of them depriving him of the Republican presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cThey are all at less than 1 percent. I guess it\u2019s a publicity stunt,\u201d Mr. Trump said of his would-be intraparty rivals. \u201cThey have no credibility.\u201d To call them \u201cthe Three Stooges,\u201d as the president has, is an insult to Moe, Larry and Curly (and to Shemp, too).\n\nThe poll numbers likely explain why state Republican parties in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina have scrapped plans for GOP primaries or caucuses next year as a waste of money.\n\nBut in a joint Sept. 15 op-ed column in The Washington Post, Messrs. Weld, Sanford and Walsh hyperbolically decried the move. \u201cDo Republicans really want to be the party with a nominating process that more resembles Russia or China than our American tradition?\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe trio concluded the piece by holding out the threat of \u201clegal challenges\u201d to compel the four states to stage nominating contests, but other states may yet follow their lead, because there\u2019s ample precedent over the past 35 years of both parties canceling primaries and caucuses when presidential incumbents up for re-election had token opposition.\n\nCanceling the primaries is also not unlike how the Democratic National Committee effectively cut the party\u2019s presidential field in half, from 20 to 10, by raising the thresholds in polling and campaign contributions to qualify for participating in their debates.\n\nIf any of the three Republican renegades were to run as independents or carrying the Libertarian Party banner, the only purpose such a vanity candidacy could possibly serve would be to help elect the Democratic nominee.\n\nDo these anti-Trump (and in Mr. Weld\u2019s case, RINO) Republicans really want their epitaphs to read that they were responsible for putting, say, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent, or Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat, behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, with all that that augurs?\n\nLike that tree that fell in the woods, none of them is exactly presidential timber anyway, and when their candidacies fall by the wayside like Mr. Schultz\u2019s, almost no one will hear, and even fewer will care.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
