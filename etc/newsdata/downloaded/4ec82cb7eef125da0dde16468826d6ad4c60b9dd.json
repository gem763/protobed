However, the additional two years are voidable and Brady could turn free agent after this season. If he becomes a free agent, Brady can demand a higher salary from other teams that are seeking quarterback stability.\n\nThere is also a possibility that the Patriots could trade Brady before he turns free agent so they can get something in return from the 42-year-old quarterback. That could be a possibility, according to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, claiming that Brady is not untouchable and could be traded by the Patriots for the right price. For Florio, only quarterback Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs is untouchable, while any team could acquire Brady if it comes up with an arrangement that is acceptable for head coach Bill Belichick.\n\nFlorio claims Belichick might accept 3 first-round picks for Brady\n\n\"Because look at it this way, if somebody were to offer Bill Belichick three first-round picks right now for Tom Brady, he'd take it. Right?\u2019 Florio told \"Zolak and Bertrand\" of 98.5 The Sports Hub. While Florio clarified that the Patriots have no plans of trading Brady as of now, he insisted that any player, except Mahomes, could switch teams with the right package that would be too hard to resist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

NFL New England Patriots\n\nAs of now, trading Brady would not enter Belichick\u2019s mind, especially with the Patriots campaign going smoothly with a 4-0 record.\n\nBrady is still reeling from his poor performance in their 16-10 triumph over the Buffalo Bills in Week 4. Brady struggled against the Bills, completing just 18 of 39 passes for 150 yards and no touchdown with an interception. Luckily for Brady, the Patriots defense stepped up with four interceptions to help the team notch its fourth straight win.\n\nHowever, Brady has committed to bounce back in their Week 5 clash with the Washington Redskins, who have yet to name a starting quarterback for Sunday\u2019s game. The Patriots enter the week as a 16-point favorite over the Redskins (0-4), who are still searching for their first win this season.\n\nPatriots have four healthy wideouts\n\nThe Patriots had four healthy wideouts during Thursday\u2019s practice. According to the injury report, receiver/punt returner Gunner Olszewski was a full participant during practice after being limited on Wednesday.\n\nAside from Olszewski, the other healthy wide receivers on Thursday were Phillip Dorsett, Jakobi Meyers, and special-teams captain Matthew Slater.\n\nSeveral Patriots players were labeled as limited participants during practice, including running back Rex Burkhead (foot), safety Patrick Chung (heel), safety Nate Ebner (groin), wide receiver Julian Edelman (chest) wide receiver Josh Gordon(knee) and linebacker Dont\u2019a Hightower (shoulder).\n\nDefensive end Michael Bennett was a full participant in Thursday\u2019s practice despite having shoulder issues.", "description": "The 42-year-old Brady could test the free-agent market after this season.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Zeegee Cecilio", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Read More On The Same Topic Zeegee Cecilio", "Redskins Qb Dwayne Haskins Sees Tom Brady As Role Model", "Wants To Share Field With Him", "Patriots Rumor", "Vikings Won T Trade Diggs", "Pats Add Rookie Wideout To Practice Squad", "Patriots Fans Mad At Decision To Bring Back Jordan Richards Instead Of Signing Wideout"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/4/os/b_1200x630/brady-could-turn-free-agent-after-this-season-image-credit-new-england-patriotsyoutube_2333941.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
