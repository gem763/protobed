He later added that the NBA will suffer financial consequences from Morey\u2019s remark, but \u201cif those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it\u2019s very, very important to adhere to those values.\u201d\n\nMorey deleted his pro-Hong Kong statement and has not repeated his support for the anti-communist protests since receiving Silver\u2019s backing. He is still receiving vitriolic tweets from alleged Chinese people \u2013 Twitter is banned in China and the company has caught the Communist Party using fabricated accounts to spread propaganda \u2013 celebrating the September 11 attacks. Similar remarks have allegedly surfaced throughout accounts on Sina Weibo, a Chinese government-controlled social media outlet.\n\nYou!Americans don't know what's going on in China,and just talk about freedom. So 9.11 was about freedom too, that's the same thing!You talk about freedom?Then you're forcing clippers owner Donald Sterling to sell his team? He also has freedom of speech!#China #NBA #morey @dmorey pic.twitter.com/Ar5aitFSqS \u2014 Fly (@cloudfly011) October 7, 2019\n\nThe Global Times confirmed on Tuesday that these messages were real \u2013 not that the users behind them were actual Chinese citizens, but that the messages existed and were not doctored via screencaps \u2013 and justified them by proclaiming that the Hong Kong protest movement is as evil as the September 11 attacks.\n\n\u201cA few angry Chinese netizens said, \u20189/11 is a beautiful date for the US. After all, freedom of speech,'\u201d the Global Times reported \u2013 not noting that Americans indeed have the freedom to praise the terrorist attacks without government retribution and that members of Congress have referred to them dismissively without going to prison. \u201cThis has been exaggerated by some US media and Twitter users to hype the tension between the NBA and China.\u201d\n\n\u201cChinese observers said these extreme comments are inappropriate and disrespectful, which the majority of Chinese people don\u2019t agree with, but it should remind Western media that for Chinese people, the Hong Kong riots are just like the 9/11, which is horrible and can\u2019t be justified,\u201d the state-run newspaper claimed. \u201cSo when a few of them see a foreigner use \u2018freedom of expression\u2019 to justify the statement that seriously harmed their feelings, they decided to make disrespectful comments as well in the name of \u201cfreedom of expression.'\u201d\n\nThe jihadist group al-Qaeda killed 2,977 people in New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania after hijacking four airplanes and flying them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The fourth plane, the one falling in Pennsylvania, never arrived at its target because passengers subdued the jihadists. Hundreds of New York police officers and first responders have died of 9/11-related illnesses in the years since.\n\nThere have been no reported deaths in the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, launched in June. Hong Kong police, controlled by Beijing, have shot two protesters ages 18 and 14. Hong Kong police and armed pro-China mobs have injured dozens of protesters, prominently including a young woman blinded by a close-range bean bag round police shot into her face.\n\nDespite its dismissive tone about the September 11 attacks, the Chinese Communist Party has used jihad as an excuse to force millions of Muslims into concentration camps where survivors say they have been subjected to torture, slavery, indoctrination, rape, forced sterilization, organ harvesting, and other abuses.\n\n\u201cChinese netizens vowed to draw a clear line with the NBA after league Commissioner Adam Silver defended Morey, who showed solidarity with Hong Kong rioters in his tweet,\u201d the Global Times claimed, without clarifying that \u201cnetizens\u201d who disagree with Beijing face swift incarceration.\n\nThe newspaper concluded by comparing Morey to former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, expelled from the NBA for racist comments against black Americans.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry tacitly supported the online vitriol hurled at Morey and other Americans for supporting the protests in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Basketball Association and the Chinese cooperation partners to the Houston Rockets made statements on this matter. I believe China\u2019s position on it couldn\u2019t be clearer,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said. \u201cI also suggest you pay attention to the reaction of the ordinary Chinese people.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, which has remained largely peaceful and leaderless since arising in June, is making four demands of its government: freedom for political prisoners, direct election of lawmakers, an end to the government calling the protests \u201criots,\u201d and an independent investigation into police brutality.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "China's\u00a0Global Times\u00a0defended Chinese internet users allegedly acting independently of the government for praising the September 11, 2001.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/september-11-first-responder-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
