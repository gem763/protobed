I\u2019ll repeat that so my meaning cannot be misconstrued. He is a man.\n\nMaybe my kind-hearted reader is offended by this blunt phrasing. Why am I calling McKinnon a man \u2014 when, perhaps for complicated reasons, he would rather be called a woman? Why don\u2019t I compromise and call him a \u201ctrans woman,\u201d as others do? Or be polite and address him by \u201cshe/her\u201d pronouns, like everyone else in the media?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you why, since you asked. This is precisely the well-meant, tragically na\u00efve logic that has enabled a structure of lies and tyranny to be erected around us, a structure that most cannot opt out of without incurring an enormous social cost. It is a structure in which cheating and viciousness are rewarded while civility and truth-telling are punished. Rachel McKinnon is the perfect example of how this structure works and operates, as well as why we should resist it.\n\nFor context: McKinnon lived unambiguously as a man (called \u201cRhys\u201d) until the age of 29. In addition to male puberty, he has had a full experience of modern academia where he developed a particular enthusiasm for the philosophy of lies (literally) and for \u201cgender studies.\u201d Graduating first from the University of Victoria in British Columbia, he completed a Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo with a thesis on assertions, \u201cWhy You Don\u2019t Need to Know What You\u2019re Talking About\u201d (the literal subtitle). Later, he published a book on this subject titled The Norms of Assertion: Truth, Lies and Warrant, in which he argues \u201cthat in some special contexts, we can lie.\u201d Which contexts might those be?\n\nWhile serving as an associate professor at the College of Charleston, S.C., McKinnon decided to get into sport cycling. (Fair.) He won the 200-meter sprint record for women in the 35\u201339 range in 2018, and then the UCI Masters World Track Cycling Championship in the Women\u2019s Sprint. (Not fair.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis month, he defended his title. From the news last week: \u201cRachel McKinnon successfully defended her track World Championship title in Manchester,\u201d per Cycling Weekly; \u201cProminent trans rights campaigner McKinnon has defended her right to compete,\u201d per the BBC; \u201c[McKinnon] found herself defending her title against a critic \u2014 the president\u2019s son,\u201d per CBS News; \u201cMcKinnon keeps dominating women\u2019s cycling. And she keeps creating controversy all the way,\u201d per the New York Post.\n\nSo, what\u2019s this got to do with the culture at large? First, by pretending that McKinnon is not a man, we have allowed him to cheat at sports at the expense of his female competitors. Because McKinnon being a man is directly relevant to the argument that he should not compete against women, in calling him something other than a man, we obfuscate that argument \u2014 and all for the sake of a very recently invented set of blasphemy norms (e.g. \u201cmisgendering\u201d and \u201cdeadnaming\u201d) that don\u2019t apply to us non-believers.\n\nSecond, by pretending that McKinnon is not a man \u2014 but rather a vulnerable woman \u2014 we have forsworn all expectations of accountability and decency. The most egregious example of this, and the precise moment I decided to stop lending McKinnon special courtesies, was when he lauded the terminal illness of a young woman, Magdalen Berns, whom I held (and still hold) in great esteem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerns believed strongly that men cannot be women. As she lay on her deathbed in Scotland, at the age of 36, surrounded by her loved ones, McKinnon tweeted that he was \u201chappy\u201d when bad people died, that this feeling is \u201cjustified,\u201d that Berns is a \u201ctrash human,\u201d and further advised his followers \u201cdon\u2019t be the sort of person who people you\u2019ve harmed are happy you\u2019re dying of brain cancer.\u201d By contrast, here is a characteristically civil, clear and courageous quote from Berns: \u201cit\u2019s not hate to defend your rights and it\u2019s not hate to speak the truth.\u201d\n\nMen can be so rude sometimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther women have tried to articulate similar sentiments with regards to McKinnon. Take Jen Wagner-Assali, who, after coming in third to McKinnon at the UCI Masters Track World Championship in 2018, tweeted: \u201cit\u2019s definitely NOT fair.\u201d After being bullied, Wagner apologized to McKinnon for causing offense. But that wasn\u2019t enough, as McKinnon explained. \u201cThe apology is not accepted: she still thinks what she said. She merely apologizes for being caught saying it publicly.\u201d\n\nShe still thinks it\u2019s not fair for a man to beat her in the women\u2019s category? Just imagine!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKinnon then lashed out at the tennis star and longtime defender of sexual minorities, Martina Navratilova, who wrote in the Sunday Times of London that to allow men to compete against women was to permit \u201ccheating.\u201d Already, trans athletes had \u201cachieved honours as women that were beyond their capabilities as men,\u201d Navratilova argued, worrying that other women would also be \u201ccowed into silence or submission.\u201d McKinnon called Navratilova a \u201ctransphobe,\u201d and demanded that she apologize.\n\nEvidently, it\u2019s not only sportswomen McKinnon has issues with. It\u2019s journalists and women\u2019s-rights campaigners, too. When a spokesperson from Fair Play for Women was invited by the BBC to discuss Navratilova\u2019s comments, McKinnon wrote on Twitter: \u201cI will not participate in a discussion panel that takes them seriously and gives them a platform.\u201d The BBC subsequently disinvited them.\n\nMcKinnon was strikingly rude and sneering to Abigail Shrier, a gentle writer for the Wall Street Journal, when she appeared on Fox Nation with him to discuss women\u2019s sports. As well as baselessly calling Shrier a \u201ctransphobe,\u201d McKinnon has tweeted that others who disagree with him ought to \u201cdie in a grease fire,\u201d a comment which resulted in a temporary suspension from the platform, much to his irritation.\n\nSo, can you compromise or appease a tyrant? You can certainly try. In a surprisingly balanced interview with Sky News \u2014 in which the interviewer explained that the science shows that even after taking testosterone suppressants, men retain indisputable physiological advantages that are especially pronounced in a sport like track \u2014 McKinnon explained why he thinks skeptics like me, who consider the science of sex, are wrong:\n\nI\u2019m legally and medically female. But the people who oppose my existence still want to think of me as male. They use the language that I am a man . . . If you think of trans women as men then you think there\u2019s an unfair advantage.\n\nOf course, nobody is questioning McKinnon\u2019s existence \u2014 for how could the continually aggressive presence of such an unpleasant man be denied? What is being disputed is his belief that he is a woman and his sense of entitlement to compete against actual women. But for those who might be more sympathetic, or for those who don\u2019t know quite how much of a thug he is, he makes the classic cartoon-villain mistake: overreach. Those who are not with him entirely, he explains, must be entirely against him:\n\n[Sport] is central to society. So, if you want to say, \u201cI believe you\u2019re a woman for all of society except this massive central part of sport\u201d then that\u2019s not fair. So, fairness is the inclusion of trans women.\n\nAs it happens, I do not have an ideological commitment to gender terminology or pronouns one way or another. For struggling, respectful souls, I\u2019m happy to lend special courtesies (in fact, I frequently do). But for cheats and liars, for bullies and tyrants, for those who seek to use my words to propagate deceit and injustice? Oh, just drop it, sir \u2014 I\u2019ll never call you \u201cma\u2019am.\u201d", "description": "Nobody is questioning McKinnon\u2019s existence -- for how could the continually aggressive presence of such an unpleasant man be denied?
