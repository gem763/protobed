Eight are sitting judges. They have established track records in progressive causes that Demand Justice hopes will energize the liberal base.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the move replicates Trump\u2019s unusual decision in May 2016, when he had become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, to release a list of his potential Supreme Court picks in an attempt to assuage a base skeptical about his conservative bona fides.\n\n\u201cWhile Democrats play by the rules, Republicans are shredding the rule book, and the result is a partisan Supreme Court that works for corporations and the Republican Party and against everyone else,\u201d said Christopher Kang, the group\u2019s chief counsel who was also the top lawyer working on judicial nominations in the Obama White House.\n\nKang added: \u201cIf we want to restore balance to our courts, we need to stop shying away from the fight for them and instead give progressives something to fight for: judges who have been bold, progressive champions who have been on the front lines advancing the law for our values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have long acknowledged that they have lagged significantly behind their Republican counterparts when it comes to enthusiasm about the courts from their respective bases. Exit polls from 2016 showed that of the roughly 21 percent of voters who said judicial nominations were the top factor in their presidential vote, 56 percent favored Trump and 41 percent voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nSenate Democrats were overconfident that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s unprecedented blockade of Merrick Garland, former president Barack Obama\u2019s final Supreme Court nominee, would backfire politically on Republicans. In reality, McConnell\u2019s decision not to give Garland a hearing nor a vote is largely seen as galvanizing parts of the Republican base who were uneasy about Trump as their nominee.\n\n\u201cThis has been a 40- or 50-year project on the right to capture the courts and I think they\u2019ve been frighteningly successful in achieving that goal,\u201d said Meagan Hatcher-Mays, the director of democracy policy at the liberal advocacy group Indivisible. \u201cIf you care about any issue, you should care about the courts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to varied legal backgrounds, Demand Justice has compiled a list of potential Supreme Court candidates that are also diverse when it comes to race, gender and sexual orientation. Of the 32 picks, 19 are women and 13 are men, including one transgender man. Ten are African-Americans, seven are Asian-American, four are Latino and 11 are white. Two are lesbians.\n\nThe group also stridently opposes judicial nominees who have been partners at corporate law firms or as in-house counsel at large corporations, even those with track records of advocating for liberal causes.\n\nMost candidates in the Democratic field have yet to say one way or the other whether they will release a shortlist like Trump did. (The president\u2019s two Supreme Court picks \u2014 Neil Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 were not on his initial list released in May 2016). Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has said she would not unless she wins the presidency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLike President Trump did before his election, each Democrat presidential candidate should also release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees,\u201d said Mike Davis, a former chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee who now leads the Article III Project, a conservative group promoting Trump\u2019s judicial nominees. \u201cBut the Democrats likely won\u2019t do this, as they know their lists of liberal judicial activists would scare the hell out of American voters.\u201d\n\nJudicial nominations \u2014 both at the Supreme Court and in lower-level tiers of the judiciary \u2014 are one area where Trump, working in tandem with Senate Republicans, have had unparalleled success. In addition to two Supreme Court justices, 150 district and circuit court judges, as well as two judges to the U.S. Court of International Trade, have been confirmed during the Trump presidency.\n\nThe full list from Demand Justice includes:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Michelle Alexander, a visiting professor at Union Theological Seminary and founding director of the Racial Justice Project at the ACLU of Northern California\n\n\u2014 Brigitte Amiri, the deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project\n\n\u2014 Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general and former Democratic congressman\n\n\u2014 Nicole Berner, the general counsel for the Service Employees International Union\n\n\u2014 Sharon Block, the executive director of the labor and worklife program at Harvard Law School and former member of the National Labor Relations Board\n\n\u2014 Richard Boulware, U.S. district court judge for the district of Nevada\n\n\u2014 Mariano-Florentino Cuellar, associate justice of the California Supreme Court\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Anita Earls, associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court\n\n\u2014 James Forman, Jr., the J.
