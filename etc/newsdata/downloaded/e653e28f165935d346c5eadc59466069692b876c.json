The mentality has improved over the last few years.\"\n\nJordan Henderson celebrates his first goal at Anfield since 2015.\n\nReds go six clear\n\nKane became the third player to score inside the first minute at Anfield and the first since 1999 when Son's deflected shot clattered the post and fell into the path of the England captain, who headed home from the edge of the six-yard box.\n\nShell-shocked from the early goal, it took Liverpool a while to find its way into the game but eventually chances started to come for the home side.\n\nA number of excellent saves from goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga, however, kept Tottenham in front at the break.\n\nThe first scoring opportunity of the second half fell to Son who rounded Alisson but saw his shot rebound off the crossbar for a second time in the match.\n\nThat miss proved costly as minutes later Jordan Henderson leveled for Liverpool with his first home goal since December 2015. Danny Rose failed to clear Fabinho's chip into the box and the Reds' captain scuffed a shot off his shin that bounced past Gazzaniga.\n\nLiverpool now started to sense victory and pushed hard for the lead.\n\nHarry Kane scored inside the first minute at Anfield.\n\nWith 15 minutes to go, Serge Aurier tangled with Sadio Mane in the Tottenham box and brought down the Liverpool forward. A penalty was awarded and Mo Salah stepped up, powering his shot into the bottom-right corner.\n\nRose, Son and Toby Alderweireld all had chances late on for Spurs, but Liverpool held on to move six points clear at the top of the table. Defeat for Spurs, now without a win in three league games, sees them slip to 11th.\n\nUnited ease to victory, Arsenal let slip a lead\n\nElsewhere in the Premier League, Scott McTominay scored Manchester United's 2,000th Premier League goal in his side's 3-1 victory over Norwich.\n\nMarcus Rashford and Anthony Martial also scored for the visiting team, but both players also saw penalties saved by Tim Krul.\n\nJUST WATCHED Concussion rule reviewed in football Replay More Videos ...

The draw means Arsenal is four points behind fourth-place Chelsea.", "description": "Liverpool came from behind to maintain its unbeaten Premier League record with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham at Anfield.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191027184609-mo-salah-liverpool-tottenham-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
