US Air Force/Staff Sgt. Betty R. Chevalier\n\nMilitary aviation magazine Combat Aircraft first reported news of the SDB integration on September 5, noting that a new \"multi-target engagement capability\" will make the A-10 \"theoretically ... able to target 18 weapons individually\" while hauling four SDBs on a single hardpoint.\n\nFirst introduced to Air Force inventory back in 1976, the A-10 had earned a reputation as a close air support workhorse among infantry troops for the distinctive roar of its GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling gun. And while Worley said that no particular weapons were \"expressly covered\" in the CFI, the clear focus of the initiative is on enhancing the airframe's overall lethality.\n\nThose enhancement include a new high-definition cockpit display that will improve the A-10's ability to find and fix targets from greater distances, jam-resistant GPS, an improved communication suite, and a three-dimensional surround-sound audio system that, according to a November 2018 request for information, will \"drastically improve the spatial, battlespace, and situational awareness\" for pilots.\n\n\"While Air Combat Command continually seeks new and improved weapons for all its fighter aircraft, A-10 planners and programmers are also keeping an eye out for which new weapons will prove useful to ground commanders,\" Worley said.\n\nWhile Combat Aircraft reported that the A-10 was set to receive \"a Synthetic Aperture Radar pod,\" Worley told Task & Purpose that ACC has \"only conducted initial suitability studies and [has] not yet made a final determination.\"\n\nWorley did confirm, however, that A-10 pilots are now outfitted with an improved helmet mounted Hybrid Optical-based Inertial Tracker (HObIT) site that more accurately responds pilot head movements.\n\nThe first A-10 airframes are set to receive the first batch of modifications as early as fiscal year 2020.", "description": "The A-10's cockpit will be outfitted with new sensors and its recently replaced wings will carry a new kind of bomb.", "authors": ["Jared Keller", "Task"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ba38f2e22af0c4e730bd5-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
