REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon/File Photo\n\nThe world\u2019s largest cocoa producer, which expects to have produced about 2.2 million tonnes last season, had flagged that it planned to limit output in coordination with neighbouring Ghana to contend with an oversupplied market. The two countries produce about 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa.\n\nIt was not clear exactly how the government plans to monitor production from Ivory Coast\u2019s thousands of small, independent farms, given previous struggles to stamp out illegal cocoa farming and smuggling.\n\nHowever, Tuesday\u2019s announcement contained the first official mention of a specific production limit and marks a new stage in protecting revenues in West African countries.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to control our production,\u201d said Yves Brahima Kone, head of the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) on Tuesday. \u201cIf you produce too much, the price will go down.\u201d\n\nCCC also said it had raised the new price it pays cocoa farmers to 825 CFA francs per kg for the 2019/20 main crop harvest, up from 750 CFA francs last season.\n\nGhana Cocoa Board also raised its price to 8,240 cedis ($1,528) a tonne for the 2019/20 main crop, up from 7,600 cedis last season.\n\nIvorian and Ghanaian farmers have complained about low prices in the past but said they were happy with the new level.\n\n\u201cIt is a good price for us farmers,\u201d said Daouda Kante who farms 7 hectares near Soubre. \u201cIt will help us save a little money at the end of the season.\u201d\n\nIvory Coast and Ghana have teamed up in the past few months to impose a minimum floor price to exert more influence on international prices.\n\nBut for all their production clout they have had limited sway over prices, which have stayed low in recent years because of overproduction.", "description": "Ivory Coast will cap cocoa production at 2 million tonnes from next year to bolster prices, a government official said as the 2019/20 season got under way on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435907957&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902Y3-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
