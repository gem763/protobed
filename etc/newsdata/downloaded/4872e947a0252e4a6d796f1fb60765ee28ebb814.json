Almost before World Rugby had confirmed the cancellation of their final pool game against France they were away to the airport and heading south to Miyazaki, safely out of the path of the onrushing typhoon and back to the same beachfront training base where they spent the tournament\u2019s opening days.\n\nGiven England were up and out of their central Tokyo hotel in less time than it takes to say \u201cthis suits us fine mate\u201d, it was an interesting moment for the tournament organisers to be flagging up the logistical difficulties of moving rugby teams around Japan. Jones, looking as upbeat as he has done since arriving, appears rather less than broken-hearted to be fleeing the typhoon zone and sidestepping the France game.\n\n'Losing by default to a typhoon': Scotland rugby fans braced for worst Read more\n\nHis good humour may also have had something to do with the latest headlines out of Australia, poised to be England\u2019s quarter-final opponents next week if the remaining pool results unfold as anticipated. It has emerged that the Canberra Raiders rugby league coach and former Kangaroos halfback Ricky Stuart will be in England\u2019s camp before the Oita game \u2013 an invitation which will not amuse the Wallabies head coach Michael Cheika, also a friend of Stuart\u2019s.\n\nJones has previous form in this area having invited Andrew \u201cJoey\u201d Johns along to training during England\u2019s tour of Australia in 2016. Only last week Stuart was coaching the Raiders in the National Rugby League grand final against the Sydney Roosters and his knowledge of knockout rugby is sure to be among the areas of mutual discussion during a fact-finding mission which was apparently teed up a couple of months ago.\n\nEngland\u2019s players, either way, now have no preparation worries having been given some helpful extra leeway by the cancellation. With Billy Vunipola, Jack Nowell and Joe Marler all hoping to be back in quarter\u2011final contention, Jones clearly views this free weekend as a handy bonus and, unlike all those unfortunate supporters who have flown to Japan to find their match tickets redundant, he is not weeping into his beer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Marler could feature in the quarter-final.

We\u2019ve been talking about it all the time, about the possibility this was going to happen.\u201d\n\nHagibis Hagibis\n\nIn other words, Jones is shedding no tears for those teams whose qualification chances have been \u2013 or could be \u2013 wrecked by the weather. Aside from an ill-judged quip about unforeseen travel chaos he would have been much better avoiding \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s typhoon season; you go somewhere else and it\u2019s terrorist season\u201d \u2013 the former Japan coach also has personal experience of how damaging typhoons can be when they strike Japanese cities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably been here for about 30 typhoons,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are just like a big thunderstorm but I can remember driving in one in Tokyo in 1996. A sign from a 7-11 convenience store flew off and landed just in front of the car. At one stage I was looking pretty dodgy if it had kept coming. I can still remember it clearly.\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s Parisse hits out at \u2018ridiculous\u2019 All Blacks cancellation at Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nFor that reason he insists the organisers had little choice but to call off the France game on safety grounds. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why everything shuts down when typhoons come because it can be particularly dangerous. This one\u2019s supposed to be a big typhoon, so I don\u2019t see any other option that the organisers had. We think it\u2019s the right decision.\u201d\n\nYes, but what about the potential damage to the integrity of the competition? \u201cThat is the way the laws are. All I can be happy with is my situation, I can\u2019t compare [it] to someone else\u2019s situation.\u201d\n\nAs Tokyo braces itself for potentially its biggest storm of the year, Jones also believes the weather should not be allowed to obscure all the positives of staging the World Cup in Asia for the first time. \u201cWe are in the midst of a great tournament and we shouldn\u2019t let this cast a shadow over it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you never try anything new, you never know anything new. We need rugby to grow and you\u2019ve seen the growth in Japanese rugby here. We have got another major player in world rugby and it wouldn\u2019t happen unless you had the World Cup here.\u201d\n\nIt will take more than an ominous looking weather forecast to persuade Jones this tournament should have been staged elsewhere.", "description": "An ill wind may be blowing for some but for Eddie Jones and England life is suddenly unexpectedly calm as they face a free weekend at the seaside", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf380bca4bbb1a31df7c892fae55e7526e6e4a26/0_38_4395_2638/master/4395.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b9464a40f44d0d201293e81ea87b914", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
