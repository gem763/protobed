But they would leave the cameras behind during missions involving confidential informants, classified information and national-security concerns. For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force, which investigates potential terrorist attacks, would be prohibited from ever using the cameras.\n\nDepartment officials said they hope a trial period of 90 days or longer will help answer major outstanding questions, including how footage should be stored and used in court cases; when cameras should be turned on or off; and how they should be used around undercover agents who require anonymity for sensitive cases.\n\nThe test run, which comes after months of deliberations with officials from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals and the Drug Enforcement Administration, will take place in about six midsize cities, the officials said.\n\nThe body camera shift is being announced at a national gathering of local and federal law-enforcement officials in Chicago.\n\nHundreds of officers across the country participate in such joint missions, and both federal and local authorities have said they find the cooperation a valuable way to share information as they investigate everything from drug trafficking to gang crime and bank robberies. But tension over the dueling body camera policies has been brewing for months, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nJustice Department officials acknowledged that a policy change is a massive undertaking, driven by years of concerns from local police departments about the ban. The issue came to a head in May after Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields withdrew from federal task forces citing the ban, which clashed with a local policy requiring the devices. Other police departments had also been considering removing their officers from federal task forces.\n\nYet federal law enforcement groups expressed concern that recording their work would have a chilling effect on confidential informants.\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo said he was pleased that the department acted quickly to address concerns shared by many departments. He leads the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which pushed for changes and helped draft the test run.\n\n\u201cIt is a recognition on their part of the importance to our membership and the communities we serve\u2026and of the value that we bring to those task forces,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Acevedo acknowledged officials are still sorting out the details but said he hopes the trial run will lead to a permanent, nationwide policy.\n\nWrite to Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com", "description": "The Justice Department for the first time will let police officers wear body cameras during some joint operations with federal agents, lifting a ban that had long frustrated local agencies, department officials said.", "authors": ["Sadie Gurman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121231/social", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
