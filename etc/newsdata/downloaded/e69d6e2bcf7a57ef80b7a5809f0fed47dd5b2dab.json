The tabloid has produced a lengthy tirade against its critics, branding them \"laymen, jesters and scoundrels\".\n\nIt insists the images are in the public interest and so they remain online where they continue to attract clicks.\n\nThe site argues that the voters need to know about the existence of such images, as they would put Mr Ignatov in a vulnerable position where he could be manipulated and blackmailed, should he become mayor.\n\nMore stories from Bulgaria\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Meet the man who saved Bulgaria's dancing bears\n\nThe tabloid site has often been accused of using defamation and slander to sway public opinion and please its political masters. The site has been ordered by the courts to pay compensation to several individuals and companies over the last few years.\n\nBut the latest publication seems to have pushed Bulgarians' tolerance towards \"unhygienic\" journalism to breaking point.\n\nIrina Nedeva, chair of the Association of European Journalists Bulgaria, told the BBC that it ups the ante as it's an attack on democracy itself.\n\n\"This is different from anything we've seen before. For the very first time, a candidate in a political election process, which is crucial for democracy, has been attacked and has been asked to withdraw from the political campaign.\"\n\nFollowing the \"unprecedented\" rebuff against the publication of the images, several political parties have announced that they will exclude the PIK online agency from their election campaign. Prime Minister Boyko Borisov confirmed this would be the case with his GERB party.\n\nReporting by Krassi Twigg\n\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.
