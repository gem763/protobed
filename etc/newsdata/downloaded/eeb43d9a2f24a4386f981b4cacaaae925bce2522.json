(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nHer husband is missing. She can\u2019t bring herself to say \u201cgone.\u201d\n\nLynette Dean, a 46-year-old accountant, heard his screams when Hurricane Dorian brought the sea into their living room. That was a week ago, when he cried out in a flood of rushing water that also took half the house.\n\nShe spent days looking. Her phone was gone. So she scoured her broken hometown \u2014 one that she no longer recognized \u2014 on foot. She looked for friends, family, anyone who might have seen her husband.\n\nAs she stepped over leveled houses, boats hurled onto streets, the overturned frames of cars, she told herself: There was no body. Maybe he was safe somewhere. Hurt, but safe.\n\nHer right arm slashed from window glass during the storm, Dean looked until she could look no more.\n\nOn Saturday, she joined the rush of humanity evacuating destroyed Marsh Harbour \u2014 Dorian\u2019s ground zero.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d she said, rolling her red suitcase to where hundreds of desperate people jostled on the dock for any vessel heading to Nassau, the Bahamian capital.\n\n[\u2018Everything I have is gone\u2019]\n\nBehind them lay a shattered place and remnants of lives scattered by Dorian\u2019s fury. A broken baby stroller sat in the middle of a street that looked carpet-bombed.\n\n\u201cI keep thinking he\u2019ll get word to me there, in Nassau, that he\u2019s still here, and I haven\u2019t found him,\u201d Dean said. She paused, raising a hand to her mouth to stifle a cry.\n\n\u201cWhere are our people?\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nFrom left: Marielle Pierre, Marie Claude Pierre Baptiste, Wajeid Romain, Jessica Bobo, Waumito Romain and Alex Fatilus rest at a school converted into a shelter. They were all displaced by Hurricane Dorian. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nSome hurricanes pass within hours, but Dorian lingered here for days.\n\nThis once-bustling port \u2014 that was home to thousands \u2014 now has the air of a town haunted.\n\nThe storm was indiscriminate, taking multimillion-dollar homes and tin shacks, blasting holes in the sprawling Long Bay Private School and the tiny Claire\u2019s Variety Shop. Two power stations have been smashed. From the air, the local chicken farm \u2014 Abaco Big Bird \u2014 is a field of shredded aluminum.\n\n[Gallery: Scenes from Dorian\u2019s path]\n\nMarsh Harbour is haunted by the dead. The government said the death toll had risen to 43 \u2014 eight on Grand Bahama and 35 on Great Abaco, where Marsh Harbour sits at a place where the island narrows and bends to the northwest.\n\nLate Friday, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis warned this nation of 400,000 that the death toll would \u201csignificantly increase.\u201d\n\n\n\nA vehicle amid the damage caused by Hurricane Dorian in the Mudd neighborhood of Marsh Harbour. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThere is a container in the back of Marsh Harbour Medical Center that has piled up with bodies. It fills the air around with the sick smell of rot.\n\nBut perhaps more than anything, Marsh Harbour \u2014 and all the towns stricken by Dorian \u2014 are haunted by the missing and the unknown.\n\nGracie Davis, a fisherman, last seen around the wood-frame houses in Murphy Town. Pedro Simon Dean, a construction company owner and Lynette Dean\u2019s husband. Sheron Octavian, a waitress at the Abaco Club, whose close friend, Larisonor St. Lovin, has been seeking her for days.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t know our pain,\u201d St. Lovin said. \u201cPeople lost. That no mean they\u2019re dead. We can hope they just lost.\u201d\n\nMany of those mobbing the dock on Saturday for evacuations were mourning not just loved ones, but a town and island they loved. Born and bred local Sara Fenelus, 36, clutched her 4-month-old son with one hand and lugged a rollaway suitcase filled with still-wet clothes.\n\n\u201cOh, you know, we used to go have cocktails down at Tony\u2019s Liquor Store, or maybe over at Dusk Till Dawn,\u201d she said, with a smile. \u201cWe had the beaches on Abaco. No better beaches, anywhere, you know. Oh, we had a beautiful town.\u201d\n\nHow long might it take to rebuild?\n\n\u201cRebuild?\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI can\u2019t get my mind around that. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019d start. There\u2019s just nothing. Maybe years. Probably longer. Look at this. Our lives are gone, our town is gone. I can\u2019t imagine this is ever gonna be the same.\u201d\n\n\n\nDestruction left by Hurricane Dorian as viewed from a helicopter over Marsh Harbour. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe United Nations, which estimated that 76,000 people are believed to be homeless or in need of assistance in the Bahamas, is providing 1,000 tarpaulins to replace roofs stripped from homes. The International Organization for Migration said 449 people are in nine emergency shelters in Abaco, with 346 survivors being temporarily housed in 17 shelters in Grand Bahama.\n\n[Outrage after NOAA supports Trump over weather experts]\n\nThere is still hope, officials say, for those with missing loved ones, colleagues, friends.\n\nSearch and rescue operations and evacuations were continuing in both Abaco and Grand Bahama islands. Authorities were working to create temporary housing for thousands, according to the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).\n\nTwo thousand five hundred people have been evacuated from the Abaco Islands, NEMA Operations Manager Gayle Outten-Moncur told reporters in Nassau late Saturday. Between 7,000 to 10,000 people there still need food and housing, she said.\n\nIn hard-hit Grand Bahama, the team has had significant challenges in accessing some areas, according to John Michael Clarke, chairman of the Disaster Relief and Reconstruction Committee.\n\nHe added that an oil spill has made the situation worse, and that the team is working with representatives to protect the water supply and fishing communities.\n\nThe hospital, he said, is severely damaged, with only the recently built emergency room surviving. The Freeport airport has been cleared for emergency flights.\n\nMinnis, the prime minister, said many of the people in shelters haven\u2019t yet communicated with their families and others looking for them. He promised that the government would soon provide cellphones for them to make free calls.\n\nMany others are simply on the move, looking for a haven as they wonder what\u2019s next.\n\n\n\nA shoe left behind in the Mudd neighborhood.

(Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIn Riviera Beach, Fla., hundreds of Dorian refugees from the Bahamas arrived Saturday after an all-night voyage on a cruise ship operated by Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line, which offered free passage to the United States.\n\nEsperanta Oscar, a pregnant 24-year-old woman, told Reuters that she has no idea what she will do in Florida.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d said Oscar, a cashier from Great Abaco, standing with her 6-year-old daughter, her 13-year-old sister and her niece.\n\nA notice informed that sanitation services, including residential garbage trucks, would be functioning throughout the day and another said crews were working on restoring energy, as well as on road debris removal in the city of Freeport.\n\n\n\nDejani Louistan stands with the only belongings she could salvage. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nIn Marsh Harbour, after what many storm victims described as a slow start, aid operations and evacuations are now running at nearly full tilt. Mental health workers have been flown in to help victims cope, but the hospital has had no time to begin identifying bodies. A growing list of the missing has gone online \u2014 Dorianpeoplesearch.com \u2014 and partial cellular service has been restored.\n\nBut in many cases here, the problem is not reception. It is the phones washed away by the storm.\n\nNear the rubble that was the Mudd \u2014 a neighborhood with one of the largest urban slums in the Bahamas, populated with hundreds of poor Haitian immigrants \u2014 Valcourt Fortilia, a 32-year-old food merchant, pointed to a pile of debris behind a field of splintered wood and wrecked appliances.\n\n\u201cThat was my house,\u201d she said.\n\nThe rest of her family, she said, heeded local authorities and evacuated to their local church when Dorian came. But not her father. Bobo Baptiste refused. He was 74.\n\n\u201cHe is a stubborn man, a stubborn man, said he was not leaving the house,\u201d she said, crying. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to leave. Said, \u2018Storms come before.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cMy family is still looking for him,\u201d she said.\n\nRachelle Krygier in Miami and Jasper Ward in Nassau contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nMassive international rescue and relief effort underway in ravaged Bahamas\n\nHurricane Dorian aid: How to donate to rescue, relief and recovery in the Bahamas\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "\u201cWhere are our people?\u201d asked a woman who last saw her husband swallowed by the sea in leveled Marsh Harbour, Bahamas.", "authors": ["Anthony Faiola", "Correspondent Covering Latin America", "Venezuela", "Argentina", "Brazil", "Human Rights", "Poverty", "Globalization", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/FcuB3R_YaoouKyjeL9t9lojSlvs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4JDXLGRWMI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
