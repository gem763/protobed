They are pictured filming in Almeria, Spain, on October 1\n\nPrince William, Sir David Attenborough, Prince Charles and Prince Harry attend the 'Our Planet' premiere at London's Natural History Museum on April 4\n\nThe premiere at the Natural History Museum marked the launch of Sir David Attenborough's eight-part Netflix environmental series Our Planet.\n\nOther celebrities in attendance included David Beckham, singer Ellie Goulding, Love Island's Camilla Thurlow and presenter Konnie Huq, who is Brooker's wife.\n\nA royal source told The Sun: 'Charles's staff are deeply paranoid about The Crown. They are trying to make him a popular king-in-waiting.\n\n'But the next few seasons are going to be increasingly focused on the Prince of Wales' behaviour, especially around his marriage to Diana and affair with Camilla.'\n\nThe source then claimed to the newspaper that Charles's staff 'made it clear he wouldn't attend the event if Netflix had any of The Crown actors there'.\n\nHarry, William, Charles and Sir David sit in the front row during the premiere in London in April\n\nSir David and Charles speak to each other outside the premiere of Our Planet in London in April\n\nPalace staff have confirmed a decision was made to ban stars from The Crown from the event, but insisted that Charles was not aware of the move.\n\nIt was also claimed that it would be 'hard to see the relevance of attendance by The Crown cast and would be a distraction to the ultimate messages of Our Planet'.\n\nLes Mis\u00e9rables star Josh O'Connor will portray Charles while Call the Midwife's Emerald Fennell will play Camilla in season three which stars on November 17.\n\nGrantchester actress Emma Corrin will play Diana in next year's fourth series of the drama which is about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, portrayed by Olivia Colman.\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokesman told the Sun: 'The guest list was decided jointly.
