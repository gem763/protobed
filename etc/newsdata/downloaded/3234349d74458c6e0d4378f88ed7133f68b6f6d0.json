His comments came amid controversy after an executive of the Houston Rockets basketball team tweeted in support of the pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\"Some of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\" Pence said Thursday.\n\n\"In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,\" he added.\n\nIn his speech, Pence said the Trump administration supports the Hong Kong protesters. CNN reported this month that Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping in June that he would not be vocal about the Hong Kong protests while Washington and Beijing conduct trade negotiations.", "description": "A top Chinese official blasted Vice President Pence on Friday, saying a rece", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/pencemike_100419as_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
