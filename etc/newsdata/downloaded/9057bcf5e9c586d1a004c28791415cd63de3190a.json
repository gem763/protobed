These are the internal issues of related countries. We hope the issues will be properly handled under their laws and systems,' Hua said on Monday.\n\nCities across Catalonia have been rocked by pro-independence protests over the last week, while London has been shutdown by climate activists and anti-Brexiters.\n\n'There can only be one standard and one attitude towards violence and in the end, double standards will only lead to self-harm.'\n\nThe staunch response comes amid increasingly violent demonstrations in Hong Kong, with protests now into almost their fifth month, and a police response involving tear gas, rubber bullets and water canons.\n\nScroll down for video.\n\nA paramedic helps a family with a child that was hit by teargas during a demonstration in Hong Kong\n\nPolice detain a protester during a rally marking the third month anniversary of alleged triads members attacking protesters and residents in Yuen Long on Monday night\n\nA pro-democracy protester throws back a tear gas canister fired by riot police in Yuen Long district of Hong Kong Monday\n\nChina runs Hong Kong under a special 'one country, two systems' model that grants the international hub certain liberties but ensures the city's leadership ultimately answers to Beijing.\n\n'There are foreign forces which are encouraging this sort of violence in the streets with the aim of destabilising Hong Kong, sowing chaos... to wipe out the historic progress made since the one-country-two-systems policy was applied,' China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told AFP on Monday.\n\nSuch action will never succeed,' he added, insisting that the Hong Kong government would be able to re-establish 'social order and respect for the rule of law'.\n\nWith 'support from Beijing, Hong Kong will continue to apply the one-country-two-systems formula', Wang stressed.\n\nWang also took aim at foreign media, complaining that some of them 'call this violence democratic and peaceful, in total disregard to reality'.\n\nRiot police fire tear gas during a pro-democracy demonstrator in Yuen Long district of Hong Kong on Monday night\n\nA young man is hauled away by heavily armoured riot police in Hong Kong last night\n\n'There are foreign forces which are encouraging this sort of violence in the streets with the aim of destabilising Hong Kong, sowing chaos... to wipe out the historic progress made since the one-country-two-systems policy was applied,' China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in Paris yesterday\n\nThese media outlets 'do not hesitate to describe the actions of the police as violence. If such allegations can be perceived as reality, how can we imagine that there is still justice in this world?'\n\nOn Monday, tens of thousands joined an unauthorised but peaceful afternoon rally which quickly descended into chaos as small groups of hardcore protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at a police station, mainland China businesses and multiple subway station entrances.\n\nThe clashes in the Yuen Long neighbourhood came a day after widespread violence in which tens of thousands marched through Kowloon district and hardcore activists threw petrol bombs at police, torched metro entrances and trashed shops.\n\nPolice ordered protesters to disperse, at one stage rushing them and detaining one person. Scuffles broke out between pro-Beijing supporters and protesters and angry residents emerged from apartments to jeer officers, calling them 'black police'.\n\nA journalist films a riot police officer charge towards protesters during a clash on the street of Yuen Long\n\nA riot police officer drags a protester across the street by the scruff of her shirt last night\n\nA demonstrator runs away from tear gas filling the air during last night's violent demonstration\n\nA riot police officer with the Chinese flag proudly displayed on the back of his helmet\n\nA police statement said police resorted to tear gas after some protesters hurled 'hard objects' at them and vandalised bank facilities in the vicinity.

A few masked protesters taunted police but quickly disappeared up side streets when officers approached.\n\nElsewhere in the city, protesters staged peaceful sit-ins at five metro stations.", "description": "The staunch response comes amid increasingly violent demonstrations in Hong Kong and a police response involving tear gas, rubber bullets and water canons.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20013654-0-image-a-17_1571703239627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
