But congressional Democrats were alarmed by the complaint, now circulating on Capitol Hill, and flagged it to a federal judge. They are also discussing whether to make it public.\n\nThe complaint has come amid the escalating legal battle between the Treasury Department and House Democrats over the release of President Trump\u2019s tax returns. Part of that inquiry from Democrats is over how the IRS conducts its annual audit of the president and vice president\u2019s tax returns. That process is supposed to be walled off from political appointees and interference.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Business Economy Irs-Whistleblower-Said-To-Report-Treasury-Political-Appointee-Might-Have-Tried-To-Interfere-In-Audit-Of-Trump-Or-Pence"], "top_image": ""}
