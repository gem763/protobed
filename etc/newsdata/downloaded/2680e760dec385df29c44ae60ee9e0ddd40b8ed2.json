REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nShares of the maker of the Patriot missile-defense system were up 2.3% in morning trading.\n\nDuring an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Toby O\u2019Brien said higher profit margins due to timing were helpful in the quarter and that across the business units, \u201cthe segment margins of 12.1% exceeded our expectations.\u201d\n\nThe company maintained its revenue growth expectations of 6% to 8% in 2020, he said.\n\nMassachusetts-based Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers are expected to benefit from the $733-billion defense bill for fiscal 2020, which is about 2% higher than the bill for 2019.\n\nSales of U.S. military equipment to foreign governments fell slightly, however, in the government\u2019s fiscal year ended Sept. 30.\n\nThe space and airborne systems business, Raytheon\u2019s second biggest by revenue, jumped 14.4% to $1.94 billion, on higher sales from classified programs and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) missile warning program. Margins in the unit rose to 14% from 13.2%.\n\nSales in Raytheon\u2019s missile systems unit, which makes radar threat-countering high-speed anti-radiation missiles and rapid-fire, radar-guided guns for ships, rose 4% to $2.17 billion in the quarter. But margins in the unit fell to 10.1% from 12.3%.\n\nAfter the quarter ended, Raytheon was selected by the U.S. Army to develop the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) to upgrade the radar on Patriot missile defense systems.\n\nO\u2019Brien said there will be about 250 radars that will need to be upgraded, and that contract could be in \u201cthe plus or minus $20 billion dollar range\u201d over 10 years.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge extension of the Patriot franchise,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nO\u2019Brien said on a conference call with analysts that Vista Equity Partners, joint venture partner in struggling cybersecurity unit Forcepoint, told Raytheon earlier this month it had exercised its put option \u201cto require Raytheon to purchase their interest in Forcepoint.\u201d\n\nAs a result, O\u2019Brien said, the parties were engaged in a formal process to determine the fair value of their interest.\n\nForcepoint saw sales decline 3% from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company now expects 2019 net sales to be between $29.1 billion and $29.4 billion, up from its prior range of $28.8 billion to $29.3 billion.\n\nIt raised its full-year forecast for earnings per share from continuing operations to between $11.70 and $11.80, from $11.50 to $11.70.\n\nEarnings from continuing operations rose to $3.08 per share in the quarter, from $2.25 per share, a year earlier.\n\nOverall sales rose 9.4% to $7.45 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected quarterly earnings of $2.86 per share on revenue of $7.28 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "description": "U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Company reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook, helped by higher demand for space programs, weapons and missile warning systems.", "authors": ["Mike Stone", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444487094&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N11K", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
