Sure, Donald Trump took a hard nativist line against Mexican immigrants he claimed in 2015 were mostly drug traffickers and rapists. But Le\u00f3n wasn\u2019t looking to immigrate. And anyway, the organizers thought, her long record of honors and awards spoke for itself.\n\nOn September 24, Chicago\u2019s National Museum of Mexican Art tweeted that \u201cLa T\u00eda Mariela\u201d was off \u201cdue to circumstances beyond our control.\u201d Despite filing hundreds of pages of supporting evidence outlining Le\u00f3n\u2019s distinguished career as a performer and writer, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied touring visas to Le\u00f3n, her cast and crew.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe play wasn\u2019t culturally unique, USCIS seemed to be telling producers Once Once Producciones. It lacked cultural value to the United States. Stay home, USCIS told Le\u00f3n and her performers \u2014 the United States isn\u2019t interested in hearing your story.\n\n\u201cYou are talking about a production that is spearheaded entirely by women. Let's start there,\u201d theater festival co-curator Jorge Valdivia told local reporters. \u201cThe songs, the music of Yucatan is also unique. I thought it was important for us to present it and bring it to Chicago.\u201d\n\nTaken alone, Le\u00f3n\u2019s situation might be read as a fluke, even given the Trump administration\u2019s well-documented hostility to all forms of foreign movement, from seeking asylum to legal immigration to working visas. But the injustice handed down to Le\u00f3n cannot be taken alone. It is merely the most recent in a long list of Trump administration visa rejections \u2014 many intended to send a political point to Trump\u2019s domestic and international critics.\n\nTrump\u2019s frequent cry that \u201cAmerica is full\u201d is reflected in the spike in visa rejections since 2017. Media attention focuses on the most egregious examples of Trump\u2019s isolationism \u2014 his indefensible Muslim travel ban tops the list, next to gut-wrenching acts like blocking visas for Iraqis who assisted our troops and even saved American lives during the Iraq War.\n\nOn September 29, a gathering of leading Chinese American scholars condemned the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to target Chinese students attending American colleges. Trump recently floated the idea of canceling Chinese student visas in an incomprehensible escalation of his faltering trade war with China. Trump, who appears to believe foreign students are in the United States solely to steal American intellectual property, would happily close the doors to international students who make our elite American universities into global research leaders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Trump\u2019s America, visa rejections aren\u2019t about making the United States safer \u2014 they exist to clamp down on opposing viewpoints. That is especially true when visa applicants represent foreign exceptionalism hailing from places Trump considers to be \u201cs--thole countries.\u201d For Muslims, the numbers are even bleaker: Nearly 40,000 have been denied tourist visas since Trump took office.\n\nTake Nasratullah Elham, a 17-year-old Afghan student invited to attend the first United Nations Youth Climate Summit last week. Elham was one of 100 exceptional international students selected for an all-expenses-paid trip to New York to attend the U.N. summit. Elham founded the Laghman Peace Volunteers initiative in Afghanistan, a campaign that argues even struggling nations like Afghanistan have a role to play in combating global climate change.\n\nInstead of taking his place alongside visa recipient and youth climate activist Greta Thunberg, Elham learned that his visa had been rejected. The State Department argued that, even though Elham applied for a non-immigrant visa, he might try to remain in the country as an undocumented immigrant.\n\nNone of Trump\u2019s outrageous behavior is new. In 2017, the State Department denied touring visas to a group of six teenage girls from Afghanistan who were invited to attend an international robotics competition. After an international outcry, the White House allowed the girls to attend the conference under \u201cprobation.\u201d No one in the White House could explain the initial denial or the sudden reversal.\n\nOur isolationism may appeal to Trump\u2019s die-hard nativist base, but it comes at the cost of American strength. The United States opened her doors to students, engineers, scientists and tourists because we understand the value of bringing together diverse opinions and fresh ideas. With our doors closed, America\u2019s greatest export \u2013 our free and expressive culture \u2013 will rot like so many tons of soybeans blocked from foreign markets.\n\nIn a different, more welcoming America, a child in Chicago may have seen Conchi Le\u00f3n\u2019s newest play and been inspired to pursue theater or writing. A student struggling with robotics may have looked to those six Afghan teens as inspiration to continue innovating. Nasratullah Elham might have stolen the spotlight from Greta Thunberg. Instead, there is only the cultural void of an America uninterested in embracing the openness that makes us great.\n\nLike so many of Trump\u2019s isolationist policies, there is no good way to measure how many intangible opportunities have been lost to denied visas and canceled speeches. By closing America\u2019s doors to tourists and academics, we risk closing the door on our future as a global leader. It is time to reconsider.\n\nMax Burns is a veteran Democratic strategist and senior contributor at Millennial Politics. He appears on Fox News, Fox Business, and Bloomberg Radio.
