Thomas Cook still had several flights in the air as of Sunday night but was expected to cease operations once they landed at their destinations.\n\nCondor posted a message to its site late Sunday night saying that it was still operating but that it was unclear whether that would change. Condor\u2019s scheduled Monday-morning flights appeared to be operating normally.\n\nAbout 600,000 Thomas Cook customers were traveling at the time of the collapse, of whom 150,000 were British, the company told CNN.\n\nThe British Department for Transport and Civil Aviation Authority prepared plans, under the code name \u201cOperation Matterhorn,\u201d to repatriate stranded British passengers. According to the British aviation authority, those rescue flights would take place until October 6, leading to the possibility that travelers could be delayed for up to two weeks.\n\nInitial rescue flights seemed poised to begin immediately, with stranded passengers posting on Twitter that they were being delayed only a few hours as they awaited chartered flights.\n\nThe scale of the task has reports calling it the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history, including the operation the government carried out when Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017.\n\nCosts of the flights were expected to be covered by the ATOL, or Air Travel Organiser\u2019s License, protection plan, a fund that provides for repatriation of British travelers if an airline ceases operations.\n\nAirplanes from British Airways and easyJet would be among those transporting stranded passengers home, according to The Guardian, as well as chartered planes from leasing companies and other airlines. Thomas Cook Airlines\u2019 destinations included parts of mainland Europe, Africa, the US, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Airplanes were being flown to those destinations on Sunday night, according to the BBC.\n\nRead more: Singapore Airlines, one of the most ritzy airlines in the world, is partnering with a high-tech urban farm to make sure it serves the best meal on every flight. Take a look inside the futuristic operation.\n\nThe company was still selling tickets until Sunday night in the UK.\n\nOne Plymouth, England-based traveler who had booked a vacation to the Greek island of Zakynthos for August 2020 told Business Insider that she saw Thomas Cook had charged her more than \u00a3600 by direct debit on Sunday afternoon for the trip but that she was not due to be charged until Thursday. It was unclear whether she would be able to recoup the funds with the bankruptcy declaration. She asked not to be named.\n\nStranded passengers can find more information at the UK Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s website, or its 24-hour hotline: 0300 303 2800 from the UK and Ireland and +44 1753 330 330 from overseas.\n\nOn Sunday, Thomas Cook was left scrambling to secure \u00a3200 million, or about $249 million, in emergency funding following a demand from its lenders. The company\u2019s executives were believed to have met Sunday with the company\u2019s biggest shareholder and creditors at a London law firm, according to Sky News and iTV.\n\nReports indicated that the tour operator failed to secure the needed funds during the meeting.\n\nThough Thomas Cook had reached an agreement for a \u00a3900 million rescue deal, with the Chinese company Fosun Tourism Group providing half of that funding, creditors had demanded the British company secure an additional \u00a3200 million.\n\nThomas Cook owns a Nordic operation, as well as airlines in the UK, Germany, and northern Europe \u2013 proposals to fund those, while letting the UK tour operating arm fail, were deemed unfeasible, according to Sky News, as have several other options that would take too long to implement. It was not immediately clear whether Condor was being funded separately.\n\nThomas Cook, as well as a union representing some of its 9,000 UK employees, had sought an emergency funding plan from the British government. Government sources, however, \u201chad questioned the financial wisdom of stepping in to save the company,\u201d according to the BBC. The company employs 21,000 globally.\n\nThe company had filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US last week, though it stopped short of declaring insolvency.\n\nWhile Thomas Cook managed to recover from a risk of insolvency in 2011, it continued to be held back by lingering debts. It also suffered by lower demand over the past two summer travel seasons, as major heat waves led many Britons to stay home. Brexit uncertainties and a weak pound also contributed, according to The Telegraph.", "description": "Business Insider - The 178-year-old tour operator failed to secure a \u00a3200 million rescue on Sunday, leading it to suspend its flights and bookings..
