So in preparation, they eat almost nonstop to build mass.\n\nIn a Facebook post Tuesday, the competition organizers announced the voters\u2019 choice:\n\nHolly was so dedicated to packing it on that park rangers struggled to even get a snap of her out of the water, a park spokesperson told NPR.\n\n\u201cShe was a submarine for the entire month. She did not stop fishing, except to dig a belly hole big enough for her to sleep in.\u201d\n\nWhile Holly won by landslide, it\u2019s worth acknowledging her biggest contenders, the \u201castonishingly obese\u201d 775 Lefty, who scored just under 4,000 votes:\n\nAnd femme fatale 128 Grazer, who came in with over 2,000:\n\nBut in the colossal conclusion, 435 Holly emerged victorious with more than 18,000 votes for the dramatically different change between her July summer bod to September pre-winter coat.
