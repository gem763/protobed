John Bel Edwards \u201cwill not protect your Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nNational Review reports that Edwards is in a \u201cjungle primary\u201d on Saturday, in which he is running against two Republicans. He has to get at least 50 percent of the overall vote to hold his position as governor.\n\nTrump told voters that both of the Republican candidates \u2014 Ralph Abraham and Eddie Rispone \u2014 are committed to protecting the Second Amendment. But he made it clear that Edwards cannot be trusted to protect Louisianian\u2019s gun rights.\n\nTrump said:\n\nJohn Bel Edwards, when it gets close, and they start calling from Washington, and Schumer and Pelosi call, \u201cWe want you to get rid of the Second Amendment,\u201d he\u2019s 100 percent going to drop the Second Amendment. You\u2019re not going to have the rights that you have or anywhere close.\n\nHe added, \u201cJohn Bel Edwards will not protect your Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
