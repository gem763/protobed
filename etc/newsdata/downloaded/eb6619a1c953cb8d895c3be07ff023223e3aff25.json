Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 significantly ahead of their rivals.\n\n[Joe Biden ahead in Democratic race, with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren filling out the top tier]\n\nDe Blasio, who failed to qualify for the third Democratic debate last week in Houston, joined the race in May. A September poll of New York showed zero percent support in his home state, and he has lagged in nationally polling as well.\n\nDuring his MSNBC appearance, de Blasio said he was not ready to endorse any of his fellow Democrats but said he would support the party\u2019s eventual nominee.\n\n\u201cWhoever\u2019s the nominee, I\u2019m going to be there for them,\u201d said de Blasio, who won his second term as mayor of the country\u2019s biggest city in 2017.\n\nDe Blasio is the sixth Democratic candidate to exit the race since July. Others who have dropped out include Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Seth Moulton (Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.).\n\nPresident Trump was quick to weigh in on de Blasio\u2019s departure, posting a sarcastic tweet.\n\n\u201cOh no, really big political news, perhaps the biggest story in years!\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cPart time Mayor of New York City, @BilldeBlasio, who was polling at a solid ZERO but had tremendous room for growth, has shocking dropped out of the Presidential race. NYC is devastated, he\u2019s coming home!\u201d\n\nIn an opinion piece posted Wednesday morning on an NBC News website, de Blasio argued that Democrats \u201cmust return to our roots as a party focused on bold solutions that speak to the concerns of working people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do not, we will lose in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, Donald Trump lies to working people, but he at least pretends to talk to them. That may be enough for him to win, if we do not constantly make it clear that the Democrats are the party of everyday Americans in rural counties and urban centers, the coasts and the heartland.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio also vowed to \u201credouble my efforts to improve the quality of life of everyday New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nMichael Scherer contributed to this report.", "description": "The mayor of the country\u2019s largest city didn\u2019t catch on with voters nationwide and failed to qualify for the third Democratic debate last week in Houston.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3ciykTv7ZdS9HyB2Z1GgZMZZhCk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7T6FBKG3TMI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
