We remain prepared to leave without a deal on October 31.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson, meanwhile, was keen to focus on his domestic agenda, promising a Queen\u2019s Speech that will \u201cget this country moving again\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe people of this country don\u2019t just want us to sort out Brexit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey want their NHS to be stronger, their streets safer, their Wifi faster, the air they breathe cleaner, their kids\u2019 schools better-funded \u2013 and this optimistic and ambitious Queen\u2019s Speech sets us on a course to make all that happen, and more besides.\n\n\u201cAfter one of the least-active parliaments in living memory, the proposals we are bringing forward will get this country moving again.\n\n\u201cThis is a Queen\u2019s Speech that will deliver for every corner of the UK and make this, once again, the greatest place on earth.\u201d\n\nThe measures include a new Environment Bill setting legally binding targets to reduce plastics, restore biodiversity, improve water quality and cut air pollution.\n\nGeneral Lord Dannatt has expressed disappointment that there will not be a Bill to protect veterans from prosecution (Kirsty O\u00b4Connor/PA)\n\nThere will also be Brexit-related legislation intended to establish a \u201cfair\u201d immigration system, ensure faster access to new medicines and to open up markets.\n\nSpecific measures include:\n\n\u2013 Immigration and Social Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill to end freedom of movement and introduce a points-based immigration system from 2021.\n\n\u2013 Railway reform with a white paper setting out proposals to overhaul the current system of franchising and creating a new commercial model.\n\n\u2013 Building safety standards with the establishment of a new regulator with powers to impose criminal sanctions for breaches of building regulations.\n\n\u2013 NHS Health Investigations Bill will create a new independent body with legal powers to ensure patient safety.\n\n\u2013 Mental health reform to reduce the number of detentions under the Mental Health Act by ensuring more people get the treatment they need.\n\nHowever there was anger after it emerged that an expected Bill to protect military veterans of the Northern Ireland Troubles from repeated investigations into alleged historical offences appeared to have been dropped.\n\nThe former head of the Army, General Lord Dannatt, said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that large numbers of former soldiers still faced the risk of prosecution years after they had left the service.\n\n\u201cIt is a really major issue here which the Government has got to address,\u201d he said.", "description": "PM plans to rush through legislation ratifying any Brexit deal he manages to strike at this week\u00b4s EU summit in Brussels", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/09/wire-19650084-1570957125-499_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
