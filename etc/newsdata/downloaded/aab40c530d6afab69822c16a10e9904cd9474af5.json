That dodgy for-profit institution of higher learning went out of business in 2015 amid widespread claims that officials lied to students about everything from graduation rates to job placement statistics.\n\nThe Corinthian lawsuit revolves around Education Department rules that allow students who believe they were defrauded by their college to petition for the government to dismiss their loan. DeVos considers this tantamount to \u201cfree money\u201d (unlike, say, the millions and millions of dollars she inherited) and has tried to limit the amount of people eligible for relief as a result of the closure of Corinthian any way she possibly can.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this particular case, the Education Department attempted to deny payments based on a comparison of students\u2019 earnings with those who attended similar programs \u2014 data that came by way of revealing borrowers\u2019 personal identifying information, including Social Security numbers, with the Social Security Administration. Kim put a stop to that in early 2018, saying it violated federal privacy statutes.\n\nDespite that ruling, the department continued to try to collect the money owed from a large number of people, docking paychecks and confiscating tax refunds. On Monday, a lawyer attempted to pass the buck, claiming it was \u201csurprised\u201d to learn how the student loan servicers bungled the judge\u2019s order.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem: Student loan processors have loads of what the department described as \u201cnoncompliance issues.\u201d So it\u2019s no surprise that Kim apparently did not find the department\u2019s excuse credible. A furious Kim told Education Department officials: \u201cI\u2019m not sending anyone to jail yet, but it\u2019s good to know I have that ability,\u201d adding \u201cthere have to be some consequences.\u201d She followed up Tuesday with a written order noting that she was considering fines or contempt \u2014 but no mention of jail \u2014 adding she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by \u201cthe sheer scale of the violations\u201d of the Education Department.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGood for Kim! Making life miserable for people seeking a chance to get ahead is all but an official policy of DeVos\u2019s Education Department. There\u2019s the utter and complete failure to honor the promise of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, while the company at the center of the public loan service forgiveness debacle has multiple ties to the education secretary and others in the Trump administration. DeVos, who attended private school and chose the same path for her own children, backed tax credits for those who enroll their children in independent schools, while trying to cut back programs that pay for after-school programs and books for low-income kids. She even supported an attempt by the Trump administration to ax federal money for the Special Olympics. All of this is of a piece with the Trump administration, which is seeking to punish anyone who needs a helping hand, is attempting to destroy the Affordable Care Act, and is making it harder for people to access programs ranging from Medicaid to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) credits for food.\n\nDeVos is taking steps to make sure she isn\u2019t put in this position again. Last month, the administration released a revamped version of the rules at issue in the Corinthian case, making it harder for future filers to prove they were the victims of predatory colleges that lied to them when persuading them to enroll, forcing them to prove they suffered financial damage as a result of the fraud and shortening the period of time they have to file a claim. All in all, DeVos once again earns my nod for the worst, most horrible member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet. It\u2019s tough competition, but DeVos once again soars to the top of the list.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Another reminder why DeVos is the worst, most horrible member of Trump\u2019s Cabinet.", "authors": ["Helaine Olen", "Opinion Writer Focusing On Politics", "Economics", "American Life", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/60nP1vQUpEUGhP8QD4VWKNU-qm4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U77UNUG6KQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
