And now, with this month\u2019s launch of the show\u2019s 14th season, it\u2019s clear Caputo\u2019s got no plans to slow down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always excited about a new season,\u201d the big-haired, big-hearted resident of Hicksville, N.Y., tells Yahoo Lifestyle, stopping by the studio to discuss the show, her fame and what she calls her \u201cgift\u201d \u2014 the apparent ability to channel others\u2019 thoughts and emotions, particularly those of the dearly departed. Past seasons have seen her not only perform countless readings for the bereaved \u2014 in private homes, at arenas and, more spontaneously, in supermarket aisles \u2014 but deal with life\u2019s many up and downs, including a house renovation, a separation and then divorce from ex-husband Larry, and now, in Season 14, wedding plans for one of her two children, 25-year-old daughter Victoria, who was once bullied online over her weight gain.\n\nHost of the TLC reality series \"Long Island Medium,\" Theresa Caputo, in New York City on Oct. 15, 2019.

They\u2019re just posting a comment, but there\u2019s a real person with feelings on the other side of that computer.\u201d\n\nWith her divorce playing out on air, she adds, \u201cIt was something that helped people. I\u2019ve had men actually come up to me and say, \u2018I\u2019m so grateful for what you and Larry put out there.\u2019\u2026It just shows everyone that we are all the same.\u201d\n\nWith the focus on Victoria\u2019s wedding, the medium hopes to show a joyous side, too.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s totally not a bridezilla,\u201d Caputo says, adding she\u2019s pleased that her daughter\u2019s been taking it slow. \u201cI\u2019m involved because I am JP Morgan Chase at this point!\u201d she adds, following it with one of her signature belly laughs. \u201cBut I try to take that back seat, I try not to be overbearing. I just try to take care of everything.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m always excited about a new season,\u201d the big-haired, big-hearted resident of Hicksville, N.Y., tells Yahoo Lifestyle, stopping by the studio to discuss the show, her fame and what she calls her \u201cgift.\"", "authors": ["Beth Greenfield", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DRFY9ruKFCFmVib65vHaqQ--~B/aD0yMjYzO3c9MzQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/dda079b0-f4f4-11e9-bfcd-62e6800a0508", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
