Justin Wynn and Gary Demercurio told officers they had been \u201ccontracted\u201d to test the security system, but Dallas County officials said they didn\u2019t know of the arrangement, according to a criminal complaint\n\nAs the Des Moines Register reports, authorities soon found out that the men were telling the truth. The state court administration (SCA) had hired them, but it apparently didn\u2019t realise just how far the security agents would go to test the system.\n\nIn a statement issued by the Iowa Judicial Branch on Thursday, the state court administration confirmed it hired the two men to check the security of court\u2019s electronic records and apologised for the clusterfuck.\n\n\u201cThe company was asked to attempt unauthorised access to court records through various means to learn of any potential vulnerabilities,\u201d the statement read. \u201cSCA did not intend, or anticipate, those efforts to include the forced entry into a building. SCA apologises to the Dallas County Board of Supervisors and law enforcement and will fully cooperate with the Dallas County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Dallas County Attorney as they pursue this investigation.\u201d\n\nAn updated statement from the Court issued on Saturday says that it is aware of a break-in at the nearby Polk County Historic Courthouse, which \u201cis similar in nature,\u201d but the SCA is investigating the matter and \u201chas no other information to share at this time,\u201d adding that the \u201cState court administration does not condone forcible entry into any building as a part of cyber-security or any other type of testing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Register, Wynn and Demercurio and employees of cybersecurity firm Coalfire.\n\nDallas County Attorney told Gizmodo he couldn\u2019t comment on pending criminal matters. Coalfire also said it could not comment on this case as it is an active legal matter and because it does not comment on client engagements \u201cdue to the confidential nature of our work and various security and privacy.\u201d\n\nBut Coalfire did say, \u201cWe have performed hundreds of assessments for similar government agencies, and our employees work diligently to ensure our engagements are conducted with utmost integrity and in alignment with the objectives of our client.\u201d\n\nThis case shows the challenges that security researchers like Wynn and Demercurio face \u2014 difficulties that can disincentive them from doing their job to the best of their ability.\n\nWynn and Demercurio\u2019s bond has been set at $US50,000 ($72,823). They are set to return to the Dallas County Courthouse for preliminary hearings on September 24.", "description": "Law enforcement arrested two men who broke into Iowa\u2019s Dallas County Courthouse this week, despite their insistence that they had been hired to do so by the state court administration....", "authors": ["Ryan F.
