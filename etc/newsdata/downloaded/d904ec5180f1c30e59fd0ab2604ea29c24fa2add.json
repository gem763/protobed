In a crazily romantic, powerful and strong gesture he had taken my surname.\n\nJim\u2019s family, to their credit, never commented on the name change; absolutely not a word. They operate a policy of non-interference.\n\nTop author Adele Parks' husband changed his surname to her's for their third wedding anniversary\n\nSurprisingly, my family found it strange. We assumed they\u2019d be delighted, but instead I think they wondered why we\u2019d refused to follow the path of convention once again.\n\nTheir reaction was similar to when we announced we\u2019d eloped to Vegas \u2014 a sort of muted mystification. They didn\u2019t express disapproval, but didn\u2019t crack open the champagne either.\n\nWhat we did was unusual and people always need time to digest new ideas. Friends, at least, said it was a wonderful gesture. They might privately have thought differently \u2014 but real friends support your choices, don\u2019t they.\n\nComplete strangers, on the other hand, have commented negatively. When Jim was changing utility bills into his new name, he found himself having to offer long explanations to often incredulous and judgmental strangers over the phone. It really irritated him, and in one case led to him changing our service provider.\n\nA bride taking her groom\u2019s name is a centuries-old tradition. For many it makes unquestionable sense, and more than 60 per cent of women still change their name to their husband\u2019s after marriage.\n\nJim Pride, now Jim Parks, made the change without even asking his wife about it\n\nSome keep their own name and other couples hyphenate or otherwise combine theirs, but less than one per cent of men take their wife\u2019s surname. It is legal but it\u2019s certainly not usual.\n\nHistorically, taking a man\u2019s name on marriage offered women legal protection, especially in relation to legitimacy and inheritance.\n\nHowever, since men no longer own their wives (phew!) and we have jobs and independent lives, many have begun to question why a woman automatically gives up her name, and why it is so rarely the other way around.\n\nWhen I met Jim at a salsa bar in London\u2019s Kensington 18 years ago, I thought his surname was awesome. He came into my life when I needed an injection of pride, and I felt his name was imbued with deep significance.\n\nMy surname is fine. It isn\u2019t associated with anything in particular but it is easy to spell and it\u2019s mine. I\u2019m one of two girls and am the last Parks in my branch of the family.\n\nl haven\u2019t always done things the way others do, but I\u2019m quite confident I\u2019ve done things the right way for me and my family.\n\nPair pictured together after getting married in Las Vegas, much to the shock of their families\n\nI\u2019m guided by a belief that I shouldn\u2019t be afraid of doing anything just because I\u2019m a woman. Obviously, Jim is a feminist, too.\n\nNeither of us is rampant or militant or any of those other terms anti-feminists fling at anyone who stands up for their rights. We simply believe men and women should be treated equally.\n\nBut we are a little unconventional. We rejected a traditional wedding and slipped off to Las Vegas to marry when our son, Conrad, was three. It raised eyebrows but kept down blood pressure and saved me turning into Bridezilla.\n\nJim and I achieved a rare thing; a wedding without rows. The three of us had the best day. When we came home we hosted a marvellous party to celebrate.\n\nAs soon as Jim and I got married, people started referring to us as Mr and Mrs Pride. There was no discussion, just tradition. Adele Pride sounded lovely but not quite real, perhaps a little remote.\n\nThere were practical hurdles to changing my name, too. When we married I was 35, had already published five novels and I was used to seeing my name in print. Maybe a little old for reinvention, I never got around to officially changing my name.\n\nThe admin alone put me off! I continued to write as Adele Parks. At my son\u2019s nursery I continued to be known as Ms Parks, although some teachers had called me Mrs Parks even before the wedding.\n\nPictured together at their home in Guildford, Surrey, this month. They married when their son Conrad was three years old\n\nSo we remained Jim Pride, Adele Parks and Conrad Parks for a few years. I can\u2019t pretend I was 100 per cent comfortable with that. I felt we lacked something indefinable.\n\nMore pragmatically, no one knew how to address Christmas cards or refer to us collectively.\n\nWho were we? The Parks Family? The Prides? Social conditioning was telling me a family is only a proper family if they share a name. I know this is untrue, but still felt the appeal of a team name.\n\nTravelling could be hard; different names meant we often weren\u2019t allowed to approach border control together. Our son was asked who we were and why he was travelling with us \u2014 particularly if he was with just Jim. We considered double barrelling. But would we be Pride-Parks or Parks-Pride? Neither seemed right.\n\nWhen Conrad started primary school, he became aware of the name situation and didn\u2019t like it. Generally, kids like to fit in. It was then that Jim suggested changing his name. I was surprised, but he joked that as two out of the three of us were already Parks, changing his name was only democratic.\n\nI looked for a precedent, but couldn\u2019t think of anyone we knew.\n\nShe first met Jim 18 years ago at a bar in Kensington, London, and thought his surname was awesome\n\nStrangely I felt some regret. I fell in love with Jim Pride, and didn\u2019t want to lose any aspect of him. Would Mr Parks always remind me of my dad and grandad? I love them both, but associate my dad with childhood, rules and dependence, whereas Jim is all about maturity and freedom.\n\nBut all this made me wonder why some men are so keen to foist their surnames on their wives. Do they want them to become their mothers? I also feared that people might think Jim was \u2018under the thumb\u2019?\n\nIn the end I realised it shouldn\u2019t be news that my husband did what hundreds of thousands of women do each year. Women are raised to be prepared to abandon their name, to put less value on it than a man \u2014 and it\u2019s not right.\n\nMaybe in a generation\u2019s time it will be normal for a man to take his wife\u2019s name.\n\nFor now, I\u2019ve noticed that when I tell other women our story, they are always impressed. They look at Jim with admiration, as do many men \u2014 although some also look vaguely horrified. I see them mentally cross their legs, convinced I\u2019m the sort of woman who secretly dreams of castration.\n\nI\u2019m really not; we\u2019re the sort of family who dream of equality.", "description": "Doting husband Jim Pride told his wife he had changed his surname to Parks, after his wife, on their third wedding anniversary.
