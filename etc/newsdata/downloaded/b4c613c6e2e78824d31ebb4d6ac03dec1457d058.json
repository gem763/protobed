If she is convicted, she could face 14 years in prison and half a million dollars in fines.\n\nThe Department of Health told WTAP it is investigating Ms. Noftle\u2019s employment history following her arrest.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t address it at one place, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to go away. The problem doesn\u2019t go away: the nurse does and takes the problem to the new location,\u201d said Carol Mallia, a registered nurse with the Massachusetts Nurses Association.\n\nInvestigators found she endangered patients at another hospital by improperly disposing of medication on 60 occasions. She resigned before she could face any punishment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
