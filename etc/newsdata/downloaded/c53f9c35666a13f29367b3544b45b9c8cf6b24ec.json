But Powell also indicated that there would have to be a \"significant move up\" in inflation before any rate hikes would be needed.\n\nIt is a Goldilocks scenario -- low rates that are likely to continue for quite some time and an economy that isn't likely to fall into recession in the near term. It is no wonder that the indexes are at all-time highs.\n\nMajor earnings are rolling in and so far look quite good. Facebook (FB) beat estimates by a solid 24 cents and reported better-than-expected revenues, as well. Starbucks was in line with soft guidance, but a weak report was expected and the stock is up on the news. Twitter (TWTR) announced it's dropping all political advertisements and is getting hit on the news.\n\nApple (AAPL) is making a strong initial move on earnings of $3.03 vs. estimates of $2.83 and better-than-expected revenues. Guidance also looks good, and it is gaining momentum as the numbers are reported.\n\nThere was a lot of news Wednesday for the market to digest, and it would not be a surprise to see some choppiness and consolidation. This positive response from Apple is going to help keep momentum going and the Fed announcement helps to keep a bid under the market.\n\nThe indexes are at all-time highs, technical conditions are good, the Fed is market-friendly and Facebook and Apple are seeing positive responses to their reports. Bulls couldn't ask for a better combination of factors.\n\nHave a good evening. I'll see you Thursday.", "description": "The Fed cuts rates a quarter point and signals friendliness to the market, while Apple and others are making a strong showing....FB", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Bulls Couldn'T Ask For More", "The Fed Cut Rates A Quarter Point", "Signals Friendliness To The Market", "While Apple", "Others Are Making A Strong Showing.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Tom Graff", "Bruce Kamich"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/6001d509-cf1b-11e9-805f-2322fdc5ffe1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
