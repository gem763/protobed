Pollard hits the post from 20 metres or so out. Can't be missing those... 18 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa Another scrum, another South Africa put-in. De Klerk zips it out to De Allende who goes crashing into a wall of black shirts. The forwards are on hand to quickly pick and drive, carrying play a good few metres forward. The process repeats, with South Africa gaining even more ground before eventually they pull the trigger and go for the dink over the top. Mo'unga mops up possession but he's carried over his own line. South Africa asking some probing questions here. 14 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa More pressure from the Springboks who are really beginning to dictate the flow of this match. They're pushing New Zealand back and back deep into their own 22. Hansen's men eventually get a hold of play before clearing their lines for another South African line-out. 11 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa The All Blacks are up the halfway line now and sense an opportunity... or they did until Crotty fumbled his pass, with the ball fortunately bouncing back to keep play alive. Moments later Barrett spots a gap in the South African line and attempts to make a break as he burns the furnace. He's almost makes it through before being brought down at the Springboks' second time of asking. Advertisement 9 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa That didn't take long. We have our first scuffle of the match, with a number of the forwards squaring up to one another down in the left-hand corner near South Africa's line. Handbags away, gents. 7 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa South Africa looking confident in these early encounters; they're taking the fight to their opponents with De Klerk keeping his backs busy with some quick hands and smart kicks over the top. 5 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa All Black line-out. Coles sends it long, really long. The intended target looked to be Reece but he couldn't quite get his hands to it and ended up knocking-on. The Springboks have the put-in at the scrum. 3 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa Wow. De Klerk, surely the smallest man on the pitch, hits Am with an absolute crunching tackle that sounds the All Black crumbling to the floor. The No 9 sure does pack a punch. Advertisement 1 min - New Zealand 0-3 South Africa Penalty already! South Africa are handed a kick at the sticks after a dangerous All Black clearance at the ruck. Pollard converts. The Springboks lead. With everything out of the way, there's only one thing left. Here we go folks - kick-off! And here's the Haka! The South African fans are doing their best to drown it but the All Blacks' voices can still be heard. This is spine-tingling stuff, with each roar from the men below drawing rapturous applause from the neutrals in the crowd. Right, that's that - party time. Advertisement The players are out! Time for the national anthems! Quite the view, quite the stadium. The final for the 2002 World Cup was held here, with Brazil famously claiming a 2-0 victory. You knew that already, though. 20 minutes to go until kick-off folks, with both teams currently going through some last-minute preparations on the pitch. The stadium is filling up nicely now, with the bright lights above adding to the awe and scale of the occasion. This should be a good one. There was a thrilling end to the clash between France and Argentina, with the French coming out on top by two points after a late penalty-kick miss from the Pumas. Catch up on all the reaction from that match here: France vs Argentina LIVE: Rugby World Cup latest updates Advertisement Hansen was having none of it, though, and accused his counterpart of trying to influence French referee J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s before today\u2019s game. \u201cWhilst I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for South Africa and particularly Rassie, I don\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s trying to put pressure on referees externally and they\u2019re under enough pressure already. They don\u2019t need us coaches doing what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nWhat have the head coaches been saying then? As to be expected, there was that pre-match verbal spar between Erasmus and Hansen. The former doubled down down on a claim by one of his assistants that referees give New Zealand a slightly easier ride, and that there is a more level playing field now that the side has dropped to No 2 in the rankings. \"Because New Zealand were No 1 in the world for so long\u2026 they had so much respect on every level, even from referees, and I think that's a well-known fact,\" he said. \"In the tough times when teams were under the pump some of the 50-50 calls went their [All Blacks'] way. They deserved that for being No 1 for so long.\u201d\n\nSo what about the Springboks? South Africa have a host of world-class players among their ranks, including Siya Kolisi, South Africa\u2019s first ever black captain, and Wasps\u2019 Willie le Roux. But it\u2019s Faf de Klerk who could prove to be the difference in Japan. Described as a \u201clittle buzzsaw\u201d by Eddie Jones, the nine has hit new heights since moving to Sale in 2017, with his energy, decision-making and wide-ranging set of skills a real asset to the Rassie Erasmus' side. Man's in the zone.
