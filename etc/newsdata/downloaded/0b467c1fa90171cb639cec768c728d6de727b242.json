He died in 1997 aged 68.\n\nMoore (left and right as a child), 56, claimed last month that her mother Virginia King took her to bars to help get attention from men. The actress said that one night she returned home to find an older man who had a key and raped her before saying: 'How does it feel to be wh***d out for $500?'\n\nMoore said it was family friend Val Dumas, who was actually Basil Doumas, the Greek-born landlord of the popular La Cage Aux Folles club. He died in 1997 aged 68\n\nGeorge Germanides, who ran a the Mirabelle restaurant with Doumas, told the Sun on Sunday: 'His real name was Basil and his nickname was always Val. He was a sort of silent partner of mine from 1974. He had a lot of money.\n\n'I bought him out after seven years.'\n\nBut he said he had 'no idea' if Moore's allegations are true.\n\nMarried father Doumas met Ms King in the late 1970s, Moore said, when the club runner would have been 48.\n\nMoore added the pair would eat at the Mirabelle, but soon Doumas would turn up at her school.\n\nShe said he later raped her in her flat, but it is not believed she reported it to the police.\n\nDoumas daughter declined to comment to the Sun on Sunday and Moore's representatives have not replied.\n\nAsked last month on TV if Moore thought she was pimped out by her mother, she said: 'I think in my deep heart, no. I don't think it was a straight forward transaction but she still did give him the access and put me in harm's way.'\n\nMoore was born in New Mexico but her biological father left her mother before she was born.\n\nMoore's mother Virginia King (left) died in 1998. She had long moved out of her home. She said she was just a teenager (right) when Virginia started taking her to bars to get attention from men\n\nMoore is pictured with her mother and her stepfather, Dan Guynes, as a child. She thought Guynes was her biological father until she was 13 when she read her birth certificate. Guynes killed himself in 1980, two years after splitting from Moore's mother\n\nMoore described her childhood as 'colorful'. Her small family moved around frequently because of her stepfather's job\n\nShe was raised by her mother and her mother's second husband, Dan Guynes, who she thought was her real father until she was 13 and found her birth certificate.\n\nGuynes was a newspaper advertising salesman and the small family often moved around the country.\n\nMoore moved out when she was 16 and began acting\n\nBoth he and her mother were alcoholics and her mother attempted suicide many times.\n\nIn her book, Moore recalls trying to save her mother's life at least once.\n\n'I remember using my fingers, the small fingers of a child, to dig the pills out of her mouth,' she wrote.\n\nBy her teenage years, her mother and Guynes were no longer together and she and her mother had moved to Hollywood, where the alleged rape happened.\n\nShe moved out shortly afterwards, aged 16, and launched her acting career.\n\nAs well as reflecting on her childhood, she recalled the troubles she had in her adult life including a 2012 collapse at a party where she combined a cocktail of drugs.\n\n'I guess the fundamental question was how did I get here from where I started to what I'd experienced, how did i get here - I lost me.\n\n'If I were to look back I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself,' she said of the incident.\n\nShe was not drinking but was partying with her daughter, Rumer, she said.\n\nIn the book, she says she took 'a hit of nitrous oxide' then smoked synthetic pot called Diablo. She also alleged that she broke her 20-year sobriety when her ex-husband Ashton Kutcher told her he did not believe in alcoholism and says he pressured her into threesomes.\n\nShe said she agreed to do them because she wanted to seem 'fun' to her much-younger husband but that they were a 'mistake'.\n\nMoore also claims he cheated on her twice and that she miscarried a baby girl shortly after they began dating.\n\nMoore also claims in her memoir that her ex-husband Ashton Kutcher encouraged her to do threesomes and cheated on her twice\n\nHer book (pictured) is dedicated to her daughters and to her mother\n\nKutcher's representatives did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's inquiries.\n\nIn a statement to UsWeekly earlier this month, a spokesman for the star said: 'Ashton knew what was coming.\n\n'He had a heads up on what is in the book.\n\n'He's not mad or disappointed.\n\n'This is Demi's truth, and he always felt sympathetic toward her.\n\n'He knows her story and that her upbringing was difficult.'\n\nThe pair divorced in 2013 after eight years together.\n\nHer book is dedicated to her daughters and to her mother.\n\nAfter moving out of her mother's home, Moore started acting.\n\nIn 1980, she married her first husband, Freddie Moore. They were together for five years.\n\nShe married Bruce Willis in 1987 and the couple welcomed three children in their 13-year marriage.", "description": "Demi Moore (pictured) said it was a family friend called Val Dumas, who was actually Basil Doumas, the Greek-born landlord of the popular La Cage Aux Folles club.", "authors": ["James Gant For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/10/19357642-0-image-a-38_1570355281280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
