That left only these people: second-ranked Nadal, No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, No. 25 Matteo Berrettini and then Grigor Dimitrov, whose No. 78 ranking actually belies his longtime prowess and speaks of a harrowing mid-year slump.\n\nRoger Federer wilts in fifth set as unseeded Grigor Dimitrov advances to U.S. Open semifinals\n\nNumber of Grand Slam semifinal berths for this crew: Medvedev one (this one), Berrettini one (this one), Dimitrov three (counting this) . . . and Nadal 33 (counting this).\n\nIf Nadal doesn\u2019t reap a 19th Grand Slam title, which would move him one shy of Roger Federer\u2019s 20, then somebody else will reap a first.\n\nAs it stands, the widely beloved Spaniard from Mallorca has played four matches here, with one walkover. He has gone through No. 30 John Millman, No. 170 Hyeon Chung (a 2018 Australian Open semifinalist on the mend and rebound), No. 23 Marin Cilic and No. 21 Schwartzman. Only Cilic took a set, and that on a night Nadal decorated with enough implausible shots that Tiger Woods kept bolting up from his seat.\n\n\u201cThe body is in good shape, I think, not big problems,\u201d said Nadal at almost 1:30 a.m. at age 33.\n\nHe\u2019ll play Berrettini, 23, the second Italian man in two years to reach a Grand Slam semifinal after none did it for 40, and after Berrettini fought through a five-set bout with Gael Monfils that felt like 15 rounds, he went and called Nadal \u201cthe greatest fighter ever in this sport,\u201d of which Schwartzman said, \u201cI agree with Matteo for sure.\u201d Schwartzman knows this from eight losses \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but this guy\u2019s still improving every time,\u201d he said \u2014 while Berrettini knows this partly because his first memory of Nadal comes from 2005 and a final in Rome that seemed to stretch across the civilizations.\n\nAn 18-year-old Nadal beat Guillermo Coria then, 7-6 (8-6) in the fifth, as a 9-year-old Roman named Berrettini harrumphed while waiting for the match to end so that cartoons could resume.\n\nHe has no personal history with Nadal, always preferable when seeking a pretty record, unlike Schwartzman, who at 27 came to his second U.S. Open quarterfinal with an 0-7 lifetime record against Nadal, including a 2018 French Open quarterfinal in which Schwartzman took a set in Nadal\u2019s kingdom, for should have resulted in a match stoppage and a brief presentation of a little trophy.\n\nTennis icon Billie Jean King on fighting for equal pay for women: \u2018Pressure is a privilege\u2019\n\nCould a player standing 0-7 against a Big Three titan get a first win against that titan for the second night running, following upon Dimitrov\u2019s toppling of Federer?\n\nNo.\n\nIt began as life tends to do, with Nadal rampaging to a 4-0 lead by gobbling up the first four points (and first game), breaking Schwartzman in a five-deuce slog for 2-0, holding at 15 and then breaking at 30. Then all life as understood in the universe went awry, and Nadal\u2019s game sprang leaks, and Schwartzman became Schwartzman.\n\nWhen he helped himself to 16 of the next 20 points, the score stood 4-4, and a thought unlikely to enter the head did enter: Could all three of the big three topple within 72 hours? When Nadal sent a helpless dribbler into the net in the 4-4 game, Schwartzman had two break points. A struggle followed, Schwartzman barely missed a forehand pass, Nadal found deuce with a service winner up the middle, and soon a Schwartzman error up the line toward an open court did stand out.\n\nNadal managed to hold and deigned to yell, \u201cVamos!\u201d \u2014 and then broke Schwartzman in a 10th-game slugfest with rallies of 17, 10 and 10 shots. Two Schwartzman errors, on an open backhand volley and a simple backhand on set point, proved more than a person can afford against Nadal.\n\nA 57-minute set ended, and it seemed to take some starch out of Schwartzman as it would for most humans. The rest of it moves along as life seems to do most of the time in matters involving Nadal, except for that bit in the second set where Nadal\u2019s 5-1 lead withered to 5-5 with some marvels from Schwartzman.\n\nHad there been room, he would have made an outstanding semifinalist among those who dare to be not yet 30, a distinction that went to Berrettini after his 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5) win over 13th-ranked, 33-year-old Monfils. That tussle saw the delightful Berrettini double-fault on one of his four squandered match points, then laugh at himself.\n\nThe whole 3-hour 57-minute thing had such high caliber of suspense, if not necessarily airtight quality, that even the guy who didn\u2019t quite win said, \u201cI like it, to be honest. I\u2019m not a sore loser. I give it all today. I served bad, but I gave my heart. You know, the crowd was amazing. They pushed me. They helped me. It was fun. It was exactly why I play for.\u201d\n\nAnd it saw Berrettini behold Monfils\u2019s final sailing forehand return, study it carefully, watch it go out, then topple to the court. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s my first semis,\u201d he said. \u201cI never won a match here in U.S. Open, so it\u2019s my second year in the main draw, I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d\n\nNow the draw will feed him to a player with 269 Grand Slam match wins and 62 U.S. Open wins, and who spoke with trademark gratefulness at 1:33 a.m. when he said, \u201cI achieved the four semifinals of the four Grand Slams this year and that\u2019s a lot, so I am very happy for that,\u201d as the only player with that distinction.\n\nShuddering is permitted.", "description": "Second-seeded Spaniard, seeking his 19th Grand Slam title, assumes role of favorite among three other semifinalists with no major titles among them.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YRJXOTGPSYI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
