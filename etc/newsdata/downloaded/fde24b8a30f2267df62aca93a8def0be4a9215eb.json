That is a sound decision, since Iran understands that deal as immunizing it from sanctions brought on by its disregard of international rules, so long as it adheres to its nuclear promises.\n\nAccepting the nuclear deal on that premise would accept the untenable understanding that it limits Iran\u2019s obligations to a temporary, partial suspension of its nuclear program \u2013 while implicitly accepting and funding Iran\u2019s other dangerous activities through the release of some $125 billion in frozen Iranian assets and another $1.5 billion in U.S. cash.\n\nNo deal that allowed Iran to assume it was free to continue to violate fundamental sovereign obligations could possibly endure.\n\nThe U.S. had tried a milder version of wishful thinking in the Algiers Accords in 1981. Iran returned our diplomats held hostage and we unfroze its U.S. assets and lifted all sanctions. Then too, Iran understood the U.S. government to have accepted a new normal in which Iran could pursue its radical agenda with impunity.\n\nInevitably, Iranian murders abroad and Revolutionary Guard Corps missiles and mines in the Persian Gulf led the U.S. to again impose sanctions. The nuclear deal is far less defensible than the Algiers Accords in that it lacked legitimacy. It was neither a treaty, nor an executive agreement, nor a commitment approved by domestic law. It never gained majority support in Congress.\n\nBut sanctions alone will not demonstrate strength adequate to deter Iran. The U.S. must adopt other measures necessary to achieve that objective.\n\nWe failed to do so in response to Iran\u2019s role in the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia (killing 19 U.S. airmen and wounding hundreds); or in supplying armor-penetrating weapons to Iran\u2019s Shiite allies in Iraq (enabling them to kill hundreds of Americans); or most recently when Iran shot down a U.S. drone.\n\nCovert measures \u2013 such as the Stuxnet computer virus deployed against Iran \u2013 can have positive effects; but avowed actions convey clearer messages.\n\nSo, what more should the U.S. do now beyond the unspecified sanctions announced by President Trump?\n\nThe U.S. knows how to demonstrate proportionate but responsible strength, as it did in negotiating with the Soviets. With Iran, American presidents of both parties have since 1979 negotiated from weakness, relying on empty threats and amateurish initiatives.\n\nStrength need not mean war. But adequate strength to deter a radical agenda is as necessary and potentially effective in dealing with Iran as it was in dealing with the Soviets.\n\nDuring Operation Praying Mantis in 1988, the U.S. hit several gunboats, warships and planes belonging to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Revolutionary Guards have never again fired missiles at U.S. flagged vessels or laid mines in the Gulf.\n\nSimilarly, after President George H.W. Bush pushed Iraq out of Kuwait, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani arranged to release the hostages held in Lebanon. After President George W. Bush attacked Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, Iran cooperated in establishing a new government. And after the U.S. drove President Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, Iran offered to negotiate with the U.S. on all issues.\n\nAs strength, including sanctions, has its impact, the U.S. will have diplomatic options which we should seriously pursue. Negotiating with Iran makes sense, just as negotiating with the Soviet Union did despite its being what President Ronald Reagan called an \u201cEvil Empire.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe had opportunities after Praying Mantis and the Afghanistan and Iraqi actions to negotiate, but failed to respond positively. Today direct negotiations with Iran are unlikely. But firmness and creative initiatives could enable the leaders of both nations to engage.\n\nWhat possible diplomatic steps could be taken?\n\nOnce diplomacy becomes feasible, a viable approach could be a process of \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d by which both the U.S. and Iran would take steps towards a better relationship that the other nation would view positively and respond to with comparable steps.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWorking with other nations that were part of the Iran nuclear deal in this process could give the U.S. greater leverage, and an acceptable channel for reciprocal arrangements.\n\nAny such effort would require climbing down from rhetorical confrontation, which may be impossible in today\u2019s political climate. But the pressure for progress grows. And U.S. diplomacy is currently full of surprises. President Trump is wise not to rush into military action. But he cannot succeed if he continues to ignore Iran\u2019s ever-worsening behavior.", "description": "The weekend attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed on Iran Wednesday and called an \u201cact of war,\u201d shows that the Obama administration was delusional to think the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran would curb that nation\u2019s radical and violent policies.", "authors": ["Abraham Sofaer", "Abraham D.
