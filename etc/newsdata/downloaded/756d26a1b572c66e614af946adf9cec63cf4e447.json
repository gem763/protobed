In Wales the cost of home care is capped, while in Northern Ireland the over-75s get it for free.\n\nBoth the Tories and Labour have been talking about reforming the system for over two decades - Tony Blair came to power in 1997 promising to look at it.\n\nBut neither has managed it. Why? The cost and complexity have proved to be insurmountable barriers.\n\nWhat is more, how much impact the policy has depends on the threshold that is set for accessing it. Even in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the bar for getting help is set very high. Only those with the most severe needs get it.\n\nThe devil, as always, will be in the detail.\n\n'Right to dignity'\n\nBased on Scottish figures, Labour said the move could save those currently self-funding their care almost \u00a310,000 a year while 70,000 fewer families would be liable for \"catastrophic\" lifetime care costs in excess of \u00a3100,000.\n\nRemoving the distinction between health and care needs, Mr McDonnell will argue, will most help families of dementia sufferers, who face the highest costs and, in many cases, have been forced sell their homes to pay for care.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption The shadow chancellor will claim people are dying due to lack of funds\n\n\"I believe the right to dignity in retirement is a part of that right to health at any stage of life,\" he will say. \"The truth is our social care sector is a national scandal.\n\n\"The next Labour government will introduce personal care free at the point of use in England\n\n\"Funded not through the Conservatives' gimmicky insurance schemes But, like the NHS and our other essentials, through general taxation.\"\n\nThe pledge goes beyond what Labour promised in its 2017 election manifesto - in which it vowed to raise the minimum asset threshold for free care, cap the amount anyone has to pay during their lifetime and support free end of life care.\n\nUnder the current means-tested system, if an individual has assets worth more than \u00a323,250, including property, they must pay the full cost of residential care without help from the council.\n\nLabour, whose long-term aim is to provide free personal care to all working age adults, says support for over-65s will alleviate the pressure on the NHS by reducing delayed transfers of care from hospital and admissions to care homes and hospitals.\n\n'Empty promises'\n\nMr McDonnell will also pledge to close the gap in social care funding - Labour has already pledged to spend an extra \u00a38bn a year over five years - and give local authorities extra support to provide care so services are not outsourced to private firms.\n\nThe King's Fund think tank has estimated that free personal care could cost \u00a36bn a year in 2020-21, rising to \u00a38bn by 2030.\n\nThe organisation said Labour's announcement was a welcome step but \"it is not the same thing as free social care, and some people would still be left facing catastrophic costs\".\n\nIn the 2017 general election campaign, former Tory leader Theresa May proposed an \"absolute limit\" on care costs paid by an individual, without saying at what level that would be set.\n\nA previous Conservative pledge to cap these costs at \u00a372,000 had been shelved.\n\nIn its Spending Round earlier this month, ministers announced a further \u00a31.5bn in extra funding for social care and promised to look at giving councils more leeway to raise extra funds via council tax bills.", "description": "Help with dressing, washing and meals will be paid for by the state in England, costing \u00a36bn a year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1825D/production/_105790989_gettyimages-868900594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
