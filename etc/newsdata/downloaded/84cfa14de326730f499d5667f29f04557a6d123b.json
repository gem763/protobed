Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) may as well have dropped the mic Thursday night after delivering a lippy response to a question about traditional views on marriage.\n\nMorgan Cox, chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors, asked the 2020 presidential candidate how she would respond if an \u201cold-fashioned\u201d supporter approached her on the campaign trail and said: \u201cMy faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that, and I\u2019m going to say, \u2019Then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that,\u201d Warren fired back.\n\n\u201cAssuming you can find one.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupted with cheers and laughter:\n\nHow would I respond to someone who says marriage is between one man and one woman? #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/8uNXqXI5n7 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 11, 2019\n\nIn response to a follow-up question from CNN moderator Chris Cuomo, Warren said that, despite growing up in a conservative household, she couldn\u2019t really recall a time where she felt differently about same-sex marriage.\n\nShe cited the lyrics of a song she learned in church: \u201cThey are yellow, black and white. They are precious in his sight Jesus loves all the children of the world.\u201d\n\nShe said that, although her exposure to same-sex couples was gradual during her upbringing in Oklahoma, the hatefulness that could be directed at the gay community shocked her, particularly from people of faith.\n\nWarren also tackled how Democrats could expect to pass the Equality Act, medical care for transgender people in the military and correctional facilities, cost-reduction for HIV medications, and decriminalizing HIV transmission, among other topics.\n\nShe had just released a wide-ranging LGBTQ policy plan Thursday morning.", "description": "The presidential candidate had a sassy response for those who say marriage is between \"one man and one woman.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9ff32b210000e706344092.jpeg?cache=vocpbdxfv7&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
