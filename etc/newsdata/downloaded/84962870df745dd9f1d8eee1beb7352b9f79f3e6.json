Kent, a career diplomat interviewed behind closed doors this week by three House committees conducting an impeachment inquiry into Trump over his dealings with Ukraine, said one of the officials.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOne of the significant aspects of this was there was no debate about this anywhere in the Trump administration,\u201d said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed session. \u201cBecause it came from Giuliani, you can imagine it wasn\u2019t just the desk officer making the decision.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a second official said, the decision to reject the visa was made by \u201cthe political leadership\u201d of the State Department. Giuliani appealed to the White House, but the denial was not reversed, Kent said, according to officials.\n\nAD\n\nAn attorney for Kent declined to comment.\n\nThe visa rejection was first reported by CNN on Friday evening.\n\nGiuliani told The Washington Post in a recent interview he was upset that Shokin couldn\u2019t get a visa but declined to say whether he had anything to do with the effort. \u201cHe had people helping him,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you more than that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe revelation is the latest reflection of how Giuliani has sought to operate a shadow foreign policy from outside the government, attempting to sideline traditional policymakers \u2014 including political appointees \u2014 to achieve political goals favorable to the president.\n\nGiuliani has figured prominently in a campaign to pressure Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to take actions that would undermine Biden, a potential political rival of Trump in 2020. Those include Trump\u2019s effort, revealed by a whistleblower in a complaint made public last month, in a July phone call to cajole Zelensky into reopening a dormant investigation into a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, that Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, once sat on the board of.\n\nAD\n\nShokin has aided Giuliani\u2019s effort, alleging in an affidavit last month that the reason he was removed as prosecutor general \u2014 and the reason Biden wanted him gone \u2014 was that he was investigating Burisma for corruption.\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, U.S. and European officials have said that the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time of his firing and that Shokin was generally not pursuing corruption aggressively and needed to be removed.\n\nGiuliani had also sought the removal of U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May before her tour was over. Her ouster outraged many at the State Department, and Yovanovitch, who is on leave at Georgetown, testified last week that her departure came as a direct result of pressure Trump placed on the State Department.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, Trump also pressed the Ukrainian president to look into whether Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election \u2014 apparently picking up on a widely discredited theory pushed by Giuliani that a computer server belonging to the Democratic Party was in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nTrump dangled the prospect of hundreds of millions of dollars in military and foreign assistance and of a White House meeting as leverage in his conversation with Zelensky, according to the whistleblower and documents that have since corroborated the whistleblower\u2019s account.\n\nOn Thursday, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney acknowledged in a news conference that Trump had in fact withheld nearly $400 million in aid because he wanted Ukraine to investigate Democrats.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server?\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cAbsolutely, no question about that. But that\u2019s it, and that\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nMulvaney backtracked later that day, saying there was no \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\nIn an interview in late September, a Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, said he had helped connect Giuliani to Shokin late last year, after learning that Giuliani was interested in Ukraine. Parnas was arrested last week along with a business partner, Igor Fruman, and charged with campaign finance violations.\n\nAD\n\nParnas said in the interview with The Post, which took place prior to his arrest, that Giuliani had first invited Shokin to come to the United States for a meeting \u2014 a plan that was thwarted when Shokin learned the United States would not extend him a visa. Instead, Giuliani and Shokin spoke via Skype in January.\n\nAD\n\nBut Parnas said Giuliani had been upset when Shokin could not accept his invitation due to the visa issue.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been here before. Never had a problem traveling. All of a sudden, he goes, buys a ticket, and our State Department denies the visa,\u201d Parnas said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the problems began. I\u2019m not going to get into what transpired afterwards. But basically, it was looked into. State took a very serious approach, and until this day, his visa has not been approved.\u201d\n\nParnas went on to say that he believed then-ambassador Yovanovitch had played a role in denying Shokin his visa \u2014 and that distress over that decision may have contributed to Giuliani\u2019s support for efforts to remove her from her post. In his indictment last week, prosecutors alleged that Parnas had advocated for her ouster at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.\n\n\u201cI think very much so,\u201d he said, when asked if the ambassador had played a role in the visa denial. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the ambassador\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nOfficials stressed that the denial was made on the merits by senior State Department officials. \u201cIt was particularly galling that this guy was trying to come here,\u201d said one official. \u201cThe department said no.\u201d\n\nJosh Dawsey contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "But the application from former prosecutor Viktor Shokin was denied over corruption accusations, officials say.", "authors": ["Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "Rosalind S.
