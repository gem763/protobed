A press release from the district attorney\u2019s office alleges You was \u201cphysically, verbally and psychologically abusive\u201d to Urtula, which escalated in the days and hours preceding Urtula\u2019s death.\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins said an investigation uncovered 75,000 text messages exchanged between the couple, many of which You allegedly sent to Urtula encouraging him to die by suicide. Over the course of the 18-month relationship, which was described as manipulative and abusive, Urtula\u2019s depression and suicidal thoughts worsened. You allegedly tracked Urtula immediately prior to his death and was present when he died.\n\nRelated:\u200b Fox News to Host Harris Faulkner Primetime Town Hall on Police Suicide\n\n\u201cMs. You\u2019s behavior was wanton and reckless and resulted in overwhelming Mr. Urtula\u2019s will to live,\u201d reads a press release on the grand jury\u2019s indictment. \u201cShe created life-threatening conditions for Mr. Urtula that she had a legal duty to alleviate, which she failed to do.\u201d\n\nRelated:\u200b 3 Things to Consider Before Sharing the Viral Video of the Coach Hugging Student With Gun\n\nThis case is similar to Michelle Carter\u2019s conviction for involuntary manslaughter for encouraging her then-boyfriend, Conrad Roy III, to die by suicide through a series of text messages and phone calls in 2014. Carter was convicted in 2017 and the Massachusetts Supreme Court upheld her 15-month jail sentence for Roy\u2019s death. HBO released a documentary titled \u201cI Love You, Now Die,\u201d which chronicled the case against Carter and highlighted her struggle with mental health issues.\n\nAs a result of Carter\u2019s criminal case and Roy\u2019s death, Massachusetts introduced legislation in July called \u201cConrad\u2019s Law,\u201d encouraged by Roy\u2019s mother, Lynn Roy. The legislation would criminalize encouraging someone to die by suicide, punishable by up to five years in jail. Carter\u2019s conviction, and Conrad\u2019s Law, remain controversial in the eyes of free speech advocates and others who think a manslaughter conviction is overreaching.\n\nWhen asked during a press conference about the similarities of You\u2019s case to Carter\u2019s, district attorney Rollins said this case is different. You not only sent Urtula thousands of text messages, but she was in close physical proximity. Carter and Roy communicated largely by text and phone calls long distance.\n\nRelated:\u200b Please Listen to Me Before You Call the Cops About My Suicidal Thoughts\n\n\u201cWe have, quite frankly, I would say, the opposite of that,\u201d Rollins said, according to the New York Times. \u201cWe have a barrage of a complete and utter attack on this man\u2019s very will and conscience and psyche by an individual, to the tune of 47,000 text messages in the two months leading up, and an awareness, we would argue, of his frail state at that point.\u201d\n\nYou will be scheduled for arraignment at a date yet to be determined. She is currently in her native South Korea and authorities are working to bring her back to the United States, according to the New York Times.\n\nBoston College spokesperson Jack Dunn told the Times Urtula was a biology major and worked as a researcher in New York prior to his death in May.\n\n\u201cAlexander was a gifted student at Boston College, who was involved in many activities, including the Philippine Society of Boston College,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWe continue to offer our condolences to Alex\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nRead more stories like this on The Mighty:\n\nWhy a Dentist\u2019s Option for Fixing My Teeth Triggered My Suicidal Thoughts\n\nWhat It Feels Like to Decide to Die\n\n8 Gentle Ways to Ask Your Child If They're Considering Suicide", "description": "A grand jury indicted a former Boston College student for involuntary manslaughter after she allegedly encouraged her college boyfriend to die by suicide on his graduation day.", "authors": ["Renee Fabian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YYT7dc0KKHMHe0RqsfPv4A--~B/aD0yMTM7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_mighty_beauty_225/bb99c7529ad5b9cef775067c13b91ddd", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
