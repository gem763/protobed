But those cultural moments had nothing on the first half of 2007, where grifters large and small were thriving: Bernie Madoff was \u201cinvesting\u201d money for the likes of Kevin Bacon and Zsa Zsa Gabor; subprime mortgage lenders offered unbelievable loans; and, for a brief moment in May, any LimeWire user looking for a Top 40 track ran the risk of downloading something else: a snap single called \u201cCrank That (Soulja Boy)\u201d by Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em. The prank came from the mind of a 16-year-old named DeAndre Cortez Way. Way was online in Batesville, Mississippi, tinkering with the peer-to-peer file sharing service. He\u2019d eye popular downloads and upload his own songs under the same names. It was a slick bait-and-switch, a kind of rickrolling before it had a name, but instead of Rick Astley you got the stylings of a scrawny kid in Flavor Flav shades.\n\n\u201cI was on LimeWire, and I was like, shit, I\u2019m going to blow up my song,\u201d Soulja Boy told me from his artist trailer after a show at HARD Summer, a music festival held at an off-season Nascar track in Fontana, California. \u201cI\u2019d put it on there, but change the title so they clicked on it. I would just take a name\u2014Britney Spears, 50 Cent, Michael Jackson\u2014anything that was on the radio, anything people wanted to hear at the time, I would just upload it and change the title. After I did that, it just started getting millions of downloads. It was so fast, like overnight.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Soulja Boy\u2019s origin story has become an essential anecdote in online folklore. By May of 2007, \u201cCrank That\u201d wormed its way onto the airwaves and got him signed to Interscope Records; it went on to spend seven weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100; it pioneered the viral dance challenge; and in 2008, became the first American song to sell 3 million digital copies. Soulja Boy evolved into the quintessential internet artist: he parlayed digital savvy, charisma, and crunk tracks into online fame; documented the entire process in videos, social media, and self-made websites; and left behind a model for web use as a tool for self-promotion.\n\n\u201cHe is a Christlike figure for Internet rappers,\u201d Complex\u2019s Drew Millard wrote in 2015. \u201cSoulja wasn\u2019t just facilitated by the Internet,\u201d Pitchfork\u2019s Meaghan Garvey added that same year, \u201che was the Internet.\u201d It echoed what the rapper had long been saying of himself: \u201cWhile sitting in a downtown LA studio,\u201d Brian Petchers recalled in Forbes, \u201cSoulja Boy turns to me and says, \u2018I invented the Internet.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut if there\u2019s any aspect of the internet Soulja Boy captures best, it is the highly permeable boundary between things that are real, funny, and resoundingly good, and those that are less than legal, mildly uncanny, and deliriously fake; the parts plagued by bad fonts, laden with 404 Errors, hounded by porn pop-ups, and primed to take your money. These days, Soulja\u2019s Facebook page is flooded with spam. His subreddit, once inundated with clickbait, has been converted into a joke page for memes about the Nintendo Kirby character, King Dedede\u2014a villainous anthropomorphic penguin. Even his social life spawns rumors of constant fakeouts\u2014he supposedly once sold Migos rapper Quavo fake lean. Asked about it, Soulja Boy laughed: \u201cI can\u2019t speak on that.\u201d All that to say: if Soulja Boy invented the internet, he also workshopped its scams.\n\nOver the past 12 years, the rapper has faded from mainstream attention, but not without leaving behind a trail of mixtapes, brilliant grifts, and semi-legitimate business ventures so gnarly and brazenly mediocre it\u2019s hard to trace them all. Just this April, Soulja Boy got jail time for faking evidence about completing his community service. But the rapper bounced back as he always does, emerging in July, five months early on good behavior. Three weeks later, he gave his first public performance in months at HARD Summer. After a short set peppered with old hits, an honorably stoned Soulja Boy sat down in his trailer, a golf-cart ride away from the stage, for an informal accounting of every alleged SouljaScam, some of which he owns, others he vigorously denies. \u201cI was always tricking people,\u201d he said of his LimeWire days. \u201cJust trying to get my name out there.\u201d\n\nSoulja Boy wouldn\u2019t get threatened with small claims court until this year. But the impulses that got him there\u2014alternately genius and gorgeously half-baked\u2014were in play from day one. In June of 2006, months before anyone got catfished by \u201cCrank That,\u201d a 15-year-old Soulja Boy logged into Wikipedia, then just five years old, to pen the biography of, as he put it, \u201cSoulja \u2018DeAndre Way\u2019 Boy.\u201d The short graph, filled with adolescent typos and narrative asides rarely seen on the platform now, described his Atlanta roots; his first attempts at music (\u201cin Middle school attendin \u2018Parks Middle School\u2019 (zone 3) Soulja Boy took his talent a little bit farther\u201d); his move to Mississippi; his friendship with producer Young Kwon; and some early tracks (\u201cDoo Doo Head\u201d). \u201cAs of now Soulja Boy is sure to land a deal soon,\u201d he concluded. \u201cSoulja Boy is the next big thing to arise in the Hip Hop Scene. Only being 15 years old of age and accomplished this much.\u201d\n\n\u201c But as his popularity waned and streaming annihilated artist earnings, Soulja Boy dove deeper into another enterprise: the world of small-time hustles. \u201d\n\nThe entry was spot-on. For one, it predicted the record deal that would come within a year. For another, it got reported for violating publication standards just one minute after going live. A user named Yanksox flagged the page as meeting Wikipedia\u2019s \u201ccriteria for speedy deletion\u201d (the crime: it did \u201cnot credibly indicate the importance or significance of the subject\u201d). But the post also captured the mood Soulja Boy operated in for years and, to some extent, still does: a mid-aughts DIY internet, where rules were more like guidelines, writing was blunt and bloggish, videos were raw and improvised, and graphics ranged from spammy to very bad (in Soulja Boy\u2019s first-ever YouTube video, uploaded a few months earlier, his font of choice is Comic Sans).\n\nNothing captures that mood better than his old social media. An early and prolific poster on Myspace, YouTube, and Bebo, Soulja Boy\u2019s most emblematic page was on SoundClick, a \u201890s streaming relic and proto-SoundCloud, which Soulja Boy calls the \u201cBillboard charts of the underground.\u201d It was here that he first uploaded music and first found an audience; at one point, Soulja Boy claimed, he averaged 19,000 downloads a day. Unlike his Myspace (which now links to a shirtless Brazilian guy named Douglas), Soulja\u2019s SoundClick is still active. The profile includes 109 songs; four available for sale at $1.25 a pop; a four-question interview (\u201cQ: Your musical influences. A: The Fans\u201d); phone numbers for his agent, label, and infamous personal line; short codes for Soulja Boy TV and the Soulja Girl Ringtone; an email address for his Sidekick LX; and a promise (\u201cWhoever Buys The Most Albums and take a picture and proove how many copies they bought and upload it and post a comment on my page or email the picture to souljaboytellem@tmail.com Will Win A Spot on my TOP FRIENDS FOREVER! You will never get taken down!!!\u201d).\n\nHis early efforts went beyond editing other people\u2019s websites. Soulja Boy made many of his own. The idea was to send off as many digital missives as possible, flooding the online market just to see what stuck. \u201cI would make tons of websites,\u201d Soulja Boy said. \u201cI just made a couple at first. But then, once I made Souljaboytellem.com, it just caught on. Everybody started clicking on it. So I just kept going with it\u2014Souljaboytellem.com.\u201d\n\nThe URL later became the name of his first album\u2014a commercially successful and massively influential debut, but one which critics hailed with vaguely rockist disdain, some calling it a scam of its own. (\u201cThe only hoe that got Superman\u2019d on SouljaBoyTellEm.com,\u201d a Rap Reviews user wrote in 2007, \u201cis anybody who spent $14.99 on this album.\u201d) Still, the next few years were successful for Soulja Boy and inextricably tied to his online identity. He called his second album, which produced three hit singles, iSouljaBoyTellem; he marketed his third, The DeAndre Way, to 4.9 million fans on a now-defunct app called \u201cSay Now,\u201d which allowed stars to call their followers en masse; even his 2008 home invasion, by all accounts a traumatizing experience, yielded a viral video craze called the #SouljaBoyChallenge. In 2011, when a documentary crew trailed him to make Soulja Boy: The Movie, the 90-minute film was told entirely through YouTube comments.\n\nBut soon, Soulja\u2019s standing began to change. The rapper had long been accused of ripping off lesser-known artists, but now, he was the one getting eclipsed, in part by a close friend: collaborator, and fellow internet forefather, Lil B. Lil B represented a kind of update in the digital celebrity: spammier (he had hundreds of Myspace accounts, thousands of songs); meme-ier (his discography includes dozens of hooks where he just repeats celebrity names ad nauseam\u2014Miley Cyrus, Ellen DeGeneres, Bill Bellamy, to name a few); and popular on a growing platform, Twitter. Soulja Boy tried to level up. He started selling Twitter engagement: follows ($1.99), shoutouts ($2.99), retweets ($3.99). He kept releasing music\u2014by now, he has dropped 60 mixtapes, 14 EPs, six studio albums, and dozens of assorted singles and features, some of which are patently excellent (the mixtape Juice is filled with anthemic, if lyrically uninspired bangers and blessed with the tagline: \u201cPower. Respect. Juice.\u201d). But as his popularity waned and streaming annihilated artist earnings, Soulja Boy dove deeper into another enterprise: the world of small-time hustles.\n\nIn the trailer at HARD Summer, it\u2019s almost a hundred degrees and Soulja Boy is bundled up: red hoodie, denim jacket, black trainers. Maybe it\u2019s the heat or the hour (late) or that he hasn\u2019t spoken publicly in months, but conversation trends toward the monosyllabic. He lobs words like a pitching machine set on slow (see: his No Jumper interview, a case study in awkward silence). That makes discussing his business ventures hard. The list is so long now he can\u2019t remember them all: \u201cMan. Probably like, damn. I don\u2019t know. Too many. Not enough. I need more.\u201d\n\nWhat might make them forgettable is that Soulja\u2019s approach to business is a lot like how he first made websites\u2014that is, opening a lot of them and seeing what works. He signed an early sneaker deal in 2008 with the Dallas clothing company Yums (\u201cYou Understand My Style\u201d), but his first real attempt, he says, came with a streetwear line called BLVD Supply, which launched in 2013 alongside his brand of hookah pens, Phantom Smoke. Next, after signing on to star in the Hollywood edition of Love & Hip Hop, he announced the Soulja Boy Official App, where fans could chat, game, and stream new music. And in 2015, Soulja Boy launched his own sneaker line called SBeezy Lights, a pair of Vans-looking things with LEDs around the edges.\n\nNone of these ventures went well, but some had funnier implosions than others. His Yums line was quickly discontinued. The hookah pens and BLVD Supply apparel appeared in several music videos, but never quite took off (the Phantom Smoke website is now defunct; BLVD Supply still exists but has no mention of Soulja Boy on its website; an email request for comment was returned by Mailer Daemon; and its Facebook page is peppered with complaints about unreceived merchandise). He was allegedly fired from Love & Hip Hop for posting a video on social media wherein he threatened an ex-girlfriend while brandishing a gun (he denies that he was fired), and the Soulja Boy Official App, though a pioneering move in the first boom of personal apps, barely attracted followers until this spring, and has been overrun by catfish models and fans pushing their SoundClouds. His sneaker business, SBeezy Lights, is still active, although they mostly sell T-shirts now. When the first shoes debuted, they were immediately compared to several off-brand wholesale models, available on Amazon for as little as $25, and his follow-up designs were identical to the popular Adidas NMD.\n\nThis is key in the SouljaScam narrative: most of his subsequent products would bear a stark resemblance to knockoffs on Alibaba or Amazon, sometimes sold at a mark-up, other times at an extreme discount. In 2016, he waded into the short-lived hoverboard scene\u2014a market populated almost exclusively by Chinese knockoffs, differentiated only by cheap logo stickers\u2014with yet another website, this time called SouljaBoard.com. (The now defunct site was designed so hastily, a Wired article noted, it still had dummy text on its \u201cAbout\u201d page). That particular SouljaScam soon achieved meta status, when Buzzfeed reported that the rapper had himself been swindled out of almost $175,000 in a credit card fraud that accounted for 75 percent of the site\u2019s purchases.\n\nThe setback didn\u2019t slow Soulja down. He went on the next year to announce a deal with World Poker Fund Holdings, a company that describes itself as a digital gaming platform, but which has minimal online presence. The partnership became a joke when the rapper tweeted that the company had paid him $400 million to put him on their \u201ccelebrity owned social gaming site,\u201d CelebrityWorld.com\u2014a stunning figure, which was quickly debunked by Forbes when a reporter determined the company\u2019s market cap was then just $52 million (It has since fallen to $9.4 million, according to CNN Money; WPHF\u2019s CEO Travis Kasper disputed that estimate, but admitted he did not know the current cap. According to Kasper, nothing has come of Soulja\u2019s partnership, but may in the future).\n\n\u201c When contacted by The Daily Beast, a spokesperson for Subway denied that Soulja Boy was ever a franchise owner. \u201d\n\nAnd in 2018, in what may have been his weirdest, but somehow sweetest and most sublimely-Soulja Boy move, the rapper claimed he\u2019d bought a Subway franchise in southern California. The investment made news again just a month after he bought it, when the rapper posted a furious video upon discovering his employees had cut out early.\n\n\u201cThe Subway, that shit went viral, man,\u201d Soulja Boy said on the thought process behind the SouljaSubway. \u201cYou gotta think outside the box. Like bitcoin. I have bitcoin. I made a song about it. I\u2019ve got too much bitcoin.\u201d (When contacted by The Daily Beast, a spokesperson for Subway denied that Soulja Boy was ever a franchise owner.)\n\nBut perhaps Soulja Boy\u2019s most overtly uncouth effort came in December of 2018, when he launched two new websites: SouljaGame.com and SouljaWatch.com. The former initially offered two gaming consoles: the \u201cSouljaGame Classic\u201d and the \u201cOriginal Soulja Game Handheld.\u201d He later added the \u201cSouljaGame Mini.\u201d These machines not only resembled Nintendo products, but claimed to carry more than 3,000 games, including several versions of Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario World. Similarly, SouljaWatch.com hawked a product identical to an Apple Watch, but much, much, cheaper: it started at $19.99 and came in several colors. (\u201cWould I buy a SouljaWatch? Hell yeah,\u201d Soulja Boy said. Asked about the watch he was wearing\u2014gold, giant face, diamond-encrusted\u2014he added: \u201cOh this? It tells time.\u201d) The store also offered a suite of Apple-adjacent products: the SouljaPad, SouljaPods, and SouljaPhone, giving new meaning to a line from his 2015 Complex profile. \u201cI have no doubt that if he\u2019d picked up programming instead of music,\u201d Drew Millard wrote, \u201cyou\u2019d be reading this on a SouljaPhone or SouljaPad right now.\u201d\n\nThe fallout was fast. Within weeks of the launch, Nintendo sent Soulja Boy a cease and desist, forcing him to pull the consoles from the market. Representatives for Nintendo did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication of this article, but by late December, the products disappeared from SouljaWatch.com. The SouljaGame.com domain now redirects to the Nintendo website. Not long after that collapsed, SouljaWatch.com came under fire from customers who claimed they never received their extremely- discounted, blatantly knock-off SouljaProducts. In mid-January, Complex ran a lengthy article on one writer\u2019s hellish journey, dating back to Dec. 5, to obtain a $19.99 SouljaWatch shipped from Russia. The headline: \u201cI Think I Got SouljaScammed.\u201d\n\nSoulja Boy completely denies any wrongdoing. \u201c Man, that\u2019s another rumor they started,\u201d he said. \u201cI think someone ordered something and when the website went down, they didn\u2019t get their stuff in time\u2014as fast as they thought. So they went and said that, but it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nStill, several people who spoke to The Daily Beast claim they were swindled out of anywhere from $10 to $200, and many, many, many more claim the same on Twitter. One customer, an 18-year-old Pizza Hut employee named Andres, told me he bought a pair of SouljaPods on Feb. 6 for $19.99. Texts provided to The Daily Beast confirmed that Andres\u2019 order would arrive within 2-6 shipping days, but by mid-March, he had not received them. After he tweeted at the store, Andres said, the pods arrived on April 6, but \u201cwere trash and horrible,\u201d with latency delays and a crappy Bluetooth connection\u2014a raw deal for wireless earbuds. Another buyer, a Twitch streamer called ConnorEatsPants, said he paid $200 for SouljaPods and a SouljaGame console to use on his channel. They never came. He says he filed for a PayPal chargeback and received a refund for the console, but not for the SouljaPods. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting on that,\u201d he said, nine months later.\n\nEventually, the SouljaWatch.com website came down. Soulja Boy claims it was hacked by a cameraman, though declined to elaborate. He quickly replaced it with another: SouljaStore.com. It\u2019s one of the last remaining websites of Soulja\u2019s spammy tech empire (RIP: SouljaBoyTellem.com; SouljaBoy.com SODMG.com; SouljaGame.com; SouljaWatch.com; PhantomSmokeHookah.com; and SouljaBoard.com. A few are still holding strong: SouljaElectronics.com, SBeezyLights.com, and the inscrutable SouljaBoy.org). You can still buy SouljaPods 2 at SouljaStore.com. The rest is mostly jewelry, clothes and items without obvious copyright infringements. Back in the trailer, Soulja Boy told me he\u2019s spent the past three weeks in the studio. He\u2019s coming out with a new album this year; also, an esports franchise. \u201cI got some stuff planned,\u201d he said. \u201cSome cool stuff. Stuff people will like. I want to sell things I want to buy. Something cool, something new. I\u2019m like, a rapper\u2014what would I want to buy? What would I like?!\u201d", "description": "The rapper/viral star/internet hustler opens up to Tarpley Hitt about his various online ventures\u2014and what\u2019s next.", "authors": ["Tarpley Hitt"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568776807/unnamed_20_dxwmes", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
