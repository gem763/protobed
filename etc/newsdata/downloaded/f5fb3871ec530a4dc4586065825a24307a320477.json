Soon the heart icon will only lead to a tab that shows your own activity.\n\nAs BuzzFeed points out, Instagram introduced the Following feature in 2011 and it initially served as an effective way to find new accounts. But in 2012, Instagram launched the \u201cPopular\u201d section, which turned into \u201cExplore\u201d and has become the main tool for serving users new content and pulling them into digital rabbit holes.\n\nInstagram VP of product Vishal Shah told BuzzFeed that the Follow feature isn\u2019t widely used and the company thinks that many users only find out about it through uncomfortable situations \u201cPeople didn\u2019t always know that their activity is surfacing,\u201d Shah told BuzzFeed. \u201cSo you have a case where it\u2019s not serving the use case you built it for, but it\u2019s also causing people to be surprised when their activity is showing up.\u201d\n\nInstagram did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAccording to Shah, the main reason Instagram is booting the feature is that it wants \u201csimplicity\u201d within the app.\n\nSome users are already lamenting the loss of the Follow section \u2014 like Slate reporter Ashley Feinberg who uses the feature to monitor all the weird things public figures are into.\n\nARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME https://t.co/NAQvAMkFiQ \u2014 Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) October 7, 2019\n\nNow users can like strange and horny content with abandon, free of concern that friends, exes and journalists will be watching to see what they\u2019re tapping.", "description": "Instagram is killing the feature that allows users to track the activity of everyone they follow.", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "David Nield"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/x4owrrkov1sbtodxj3lx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
