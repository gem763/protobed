The second page of a Google search.\u201d\n\nThe gallows humour shows that people rarely look beyond the first few results of a search, but Lee Griffin isn\u2019t laughing.\n\nIn the 13 years since he co-founded British price comparison website GoCompare, the 41-year-old has tried to keep his company at the top of search results, doing everything from using a \u201cFor Dummies\u201d guide in the early days to later hiring a team of engineers, marketers and mathematicians. That\u2019s put him on the front lines of a battle challenging the dominance of Alphabet\u2019s Google in the search market - with regulators in the US and across Europe taking a closer look.\n\nMost of the sales at GoCompare, which helps customers find deals on everything from car and travel insurance to energy plans, come from Google searches, making its appearance at the top critical. With Google - whose search market share is more than 80% - frequently changing its algorithms, buying ads has become the only way to ensure a top spot on a page. Companies like GoCompare have to outbid competitors for paid spots even when customers search for their brand name.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s brought on as this thing that wanted to serve information to the world,\u201d Griffin said in an interview from the company\u2019s offices in Newport, Wales. \u201cBut actually what it\u2019s doing is to show you information that people have paid it to show you.\u201d\n\nMarket dominance\n\nGoCompare is far from the only one to suffer from Google\u2019s search dominance. John Lewis, a high-end British retailer, last month alluded to the rising cost of climbing up in Google search results. In the US, IAC/InterActive, which owns internet services like Tinder, and ride-hailing company Lyft have signalled Google\u2019s stranglehold on the market.\n\nThe clamour from companies has prompted the UK competition watchdog to study online platforms and digital advertising in July, aiming to examine the market power of companies like Google over online marketing. The European Union has been trying to rein in Google, fining the company \u20ac1.5bn this year for thwarting advertising rivals. In the US there\u2019s a rising chorus of voices on the political left and right demanding Google be cut down to size, somehow.\n\nSearching game\n\nThe case of GoCompare shows just how difficult it is to win the search game.\n\nGoCompare is known locally for its off-beat ads where an opera singer belts out its name in restaurants, taxis and, more controversially, crawls out of a flipped car in a recreation of an accident. When customers look for the company\u2019s name after seeing an ad or type in a query for auto insurance, what appears is a combination of paid advertisements, Google\u2019s own blurbs and then so-called natural search results, a list of what the tech giant deems are the most reliable sources of the information.\n\n\u201cThe way the algorithm works is constantly changing and you don\u2019t get insight into it,\u201d said Lexi Mills, chief executive officer of Shift6, a marketing consulting firm that helps clients improve their search results. \u201cThe people who get to optimise tend to be the people with the most money.\u201d\n\nNowhere is Google\u2019s power more evident - and potentially damaging to businesses - than in the market for \u201cbranded keywords.\u201d This is where businesses buy ads based on their brand names. So GoCompare bids on the word \u201cGoCompare\u201d and when people search for that, Google runs an ad at the top of results usually linking to the company\u2019s website.\n\n'Odd place'\n\nSome businesses say that they have to buy these ads - whatever the cost - because rivals can bid on the keywords too.\n\nIf GoCompare decides not to bid for its own brand, Google can legally sell the ad placements with its name to a competitor, with the top bidders getting the best spots on the page and taking away customers.\n\n\u201cThat seems like an odd place to be that I have to bid on my own brand,\u201d said Griffin. When the company confronted Google about it, the tech giant said \u201ctell your competitors to stop bidding on you,\u201d according to Griffin.\n\nThe price GoCompare has to pay for search terms that use its brand has more than doubled since 2016, with a real surge in the last 12 to 18 months, parent company GoCo CEO Matthew Crummack said.\n\nLong fight\n\nGoogle has real-time pricing for terms like \u201cauto insurance\u201d that GoCompare relies on for sales. Every time someone searches for that term, the prices refresh, driving a tough - and pricey - battle for the top spot between GoCompare and rivals like Comparethemarket.com and Moneysupermarket.com.\n\n\u201cGoogle must be rubbing their hands together thinking, \u2018This is great,\u201d\u2019 when competitors battle it out for top spots, Crummack said. \u201cEvery time that happens, the price goes up and they don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d\n\nGoogle defends its system, saying \u201cin order to offer more choice when searching for products or services, we allow competitors to bid on trademark terms. However, we want to balance the interest of both consumers and advertisers, so we allow businesses to file a trademark claim and then we\u2019ll block competitors from using their business name in the actual ad text.\u201d The company also said it\u2019s not just the top bidder, but the top bidder with the most relevant information that gets the coveted spots.\n\nStill, GoCo is looking for ways reduce its reliance on Google, studying a subscription model under which customers sign up for a service that automatically searches for the best rate when policies are due for renewal. That would potentially give the company a captive market. It is also banking on regulators to eventually fix the skewed market, although Crummack doesn\u2019t see that happening anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that helps trading next reporting period,\u201d he said.", "description": "\u201cWhere\u2019s the best place to hide a body?
