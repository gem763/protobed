The government has routinely blocked freedom of information requests for documents on arms deals, including weapons exports to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, by citing national security or potential harm to international relations.\n\nThe secrecy has extended to major arms purchases \u2013 including of the new $50bn submarine fleet \u2013 which have helped make Australia one of the biggest arms importers in the world. Data released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute on Monday shows Australia is now the world\u2019s second biggest arms importer behind only Saudi Arabia, up from fourth the year prior.\n\nMilitary contractors are spending tens of thousands on gifts to Australian officials Read more\n\nIn 2015, Senator Nick Xenophon and later his successor, Rex Patrick, used FOI law to seek unclassified documents showing the process Australia used to award the submarine contract to French company DCNS.\n\nThe decision had embarrassed the Japanese government, a rival bidder to DCNS, and left key Japanese officials feeling \u201craw\u201d, according to one diplomat, who said it contributed to \u201ca precarious time in Australia\u2019s relationship with Japan\u201d.\n\nXenophon\u2019s FOI request was initially denied, in part because it would harm relations with Japan, and the case ended up in the administrative appeals tribunal in 2017.\n\nCorrespondence between the Australian and Japanese governments show how Australian officials approached the head of the Japanese defence ministry\u2019s weapons and warship division, informing him that an Australian politician was seeking documents about the submarine project.\n\nThe documents were relatively standard tender records, and many had already been made public. The documents were not sensitive or classified and did not specifically relate to Japan\u2019s bid. All three bidders for the submarine project were forewarned about Australia\u2019s FOI laws, and the two other bidders, including DCNS, had raised no objection to Xenophon\u2019s request.\n\nJapan asked Australia not to release the documents, including \u2013 initially at least \u2013 material that was already publicly available.\n\nWhen asked why it would be harmful to release documents already in the public realm, the senior Australian diplomat Graham Fletcher, told the tribunal: \u201cIf the information is out there the material damage is perhaps less but that\u2019s not really the question, the question is will our relationship with Japan be damaged, if we override their objection or disregard and then release the information. And based on my knowledge our relationship will be damaged.\u201d\n\nDefence ordered to hand over documents on $50bn submarine deal with French Read more\n\n\u201cIt would reopen some sensitivities about the whole history of this issue, which we hope to put behind us.\u201d\n\nThe defence department this month won the tribunal case, although they were ordered to release some additional documents to Patrick.\n\nPatrick told Guardian Australia he had unsuccessfully sought a meeting with Japan\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Sumio Kasaka, about the issue.\n\n\u201cI have seen the documents that are being withheld from release and I am of the strong view that Japan is being rather precious and somewhat disrespectful to Australia\u2019s principles of transparency over their release,\u201d Patrick said.\n\n\u201cThe decision raises questions as to whether we should invite Japan to tender for future defence projects.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be the case that, just because Japan tenders for a contract, Australians are then not permitted to the transparency over public expenditure that they are supposed to enjoy.\u201d\n\nThe defence department acknowledged the tribunal\u2019s decision and said it accorded with its views on the release of the documents.\n\n\u201cThe tribunal\u2019s decision aligns with the views of defence, specifically that it was necessary to protect the competitive evaluation process in order to uphold the strong standing of our international relationships,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe department said it would release information that has otherwise been made public since the original FOI request four years ago.\n\n\u201cSince the original FOI request, which was made on 21 September 2015 while the competitive evaluation process was still underway, some information has become publicly available in the ordinary course of announcements, this includes [Australian national audit office] audits and proceedings such as senate estimates.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefence will release the publicly available information which was identified during the proceedings, in accordance with the tribunal\u2019s decision.\u201d", "description": "New data shows Australia is second biggest arms importer but deals frequently shrouded in secrecy", "authors": ["Christopher Knaus"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c073d752629f55363559df6c9664372804115184/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=508ec3b229352ddb81673f20495fb817", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
