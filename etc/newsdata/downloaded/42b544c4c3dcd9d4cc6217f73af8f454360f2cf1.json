Now it fears they could be among the dozens of people found dead in the back of a truck in England.\n\nThe mother and a sister of Bui Thi Nhung cried as they set up an altar with incense and a photo of the missing 19-year-old. The family heard from a friend living in the U.K. that \u201cNhung is one of the victims,\u201d said a relative who was visiting the woman\u2019s despaired mother.\n\nNhung paid an agent over $10,000 with the hope of entering Britain to work as a nail technician, the relative said.\n\nNhung and many others from Yen Thanh, the farming district in Nghe An province where Do Thanh village is located some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Hanoi, travel abroad looking to make the type of money they cannot earn in Vietnam. One of their main goals is to send back enough to allow their families to build large homes that they otherwise would be unable to afford.\n\n\u201cMany families in Yen Thanh have gotten rich from money sent back by their children working abroad,\u201d said Le D\u00ecnh Tuan, one of Nhung\u2019s neighbors, who was at the house.\n\nOn Saturday evening, about 200 people attended a ceremony at a church in Do Thanh organized by a Catholic priest to pray for three possible victims from the area, including Nhung.\n\nWhile Nhung is Catholic, the other two are not, but the priest, the Rev. Nguyen Duc Vinh, said, \u201cWe pray for everyone regardless of their religions.\u201d\n\nMany of the attendees wore white headbands, which are normally worn during Vietnamese funerals as a symbol of mourning.\n\nU.K. police said Saturday that all 39 victims were out of the truck and in a mortuary awaiting autopsies. But they said the victims have not been identified and very few documents were found with the bodies.\n\nAlso Saturday, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered investigations into alleged human trafficking, according to a government statement. He also ordered Vietnam\u2019s Embassy in London to closely work with British authorities to identify the possible Vietnamese victims.\n\nVietnamese Ambassador Tr?n Ng?c An visited the scene and worked with Essex police to deliver information from concerned Vietnamese families, the Vietnam News Agency reported.\n\nA representative for VietHome, a U.K.-based organization that assists the local Vietnamese community, had said the group sent photos of nearly 20 people reported missing to British police.\n\nBritish police initially said they believed the victims found in the container truck Wednesday in southeastern England were Chinese, but later acknowledged that it was a \u201cdeveloping picture.\u201d\n\nChina said it could not yet confirm the victims\u2019 nationalities or identities. There was speculation circulating online in Vietnam that the victims may have been traveling on false Chinese passports.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Giap Nguyen in London contributed to this report.", "description": "DO THANH, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 The rural village of Do Thanh in central Vietnam has relied on its sons and daughters working abroad to send money back home.
