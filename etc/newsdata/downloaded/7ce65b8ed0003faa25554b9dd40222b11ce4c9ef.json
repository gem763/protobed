Only five career staffers, not dozens, have resigned, and none were \u201ctargeted\u201d or \u201cforced out\u201d as alleged by Axios, Judd P. Deere, White House deputy press secretary, told The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cCareer staff has been hired, or is being sought to replace those employees who have departed,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
