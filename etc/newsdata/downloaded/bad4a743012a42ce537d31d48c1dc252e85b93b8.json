REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun\n\nThe Silver Arrows wrapped up the constructors\u2019 crown with four races to spare at Suzuka, with only Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas now left in the running for the other championship.\n\nHamilton is 64 points ahead of the Finn, Sunday\u2019s winner, and firmly on course to secure his sixth title with only Michael Schumacher \u2014 on seven \u2014 ahead of the Briton in the sport\u2019s all-time record books.\n\n\u201cEvery year we are trying to set objectives that motivate us,\u201d Mercedes F1 principal Toto Wolff told reporters as the team celebrated.\n\n\u201cSo we have beaten the Ferrari record now and we\u2019ve got to reinvent ourselves for next year.\u201d\n\nFerrari won six successive constructors\u2019 titles between 1999 and 2004, with Schumacher taking five drivers\u2019 crowns in a row from 2000-04.\n\nHamilton has already claimed several of Schumacher\u2019s records but the two big ones \u2014 the most titles and races won \u2014 are still to be matched.\n\nThe 34-year-old is on 82 wins, nine short of Schumacher\u2019s 91, with that also looking a realistic target for 2020 given that Hamilton is averaging 10 wins a season over the past six campaigns.\n\nMercedes are still far off Ferrari\u2019s record 16 constructors\u2019 championships and 15 drivers\u2019 titles but making it six on Sunday was massive for a team who have tried to portray themselves as underdogs against a faster Ferrari this season.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is enormous,\u201d said Wolff. \u201cThe truth is you are setting your own bar very high, and your own expectations, and then just not meeting those expectations is extremely painful.\u201d\n\nNext season, with 22 races, will be the longest ever and Mercedes are already concerned that Ferrari have a performance advantage that they can carry over to good effect with stable rules before an overhaul in 2021.\n\nFerrari have been on pole for the past five races and locked out the front row in Suzuka, and Wolff said their could be no complacency and there was still plenty of work to be done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always this mixture of feelings that on the one side you have won a sixth double, and you need to be overwhelmed, and on the other side we are just eager to get the performance back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are so performance-driven that we\u2019ve got to get the performance back into the car.\u201d\n\nMercedes returned to Formula One as a fully-fledged constructor in 2010, taking over the title-winning Brawn GP team. They got off to a hesitant start but have dominated since the dawn of the turbo-hybrid era in 2014.\n\nSunday\u2019s win was their 99th in Formula One, including those from when they last competed as a fully-fledged constructor in 1954 and 1955.\n\nThey have scored 86 of those victories in the last six seasons, with their biggest haul coming in 2016 when they won 19 of 21 races.\n\n\u201cI could spend a whole day trying to analyse what I think are the strengths of the group,\u201d said Wolff.\n\n\u201cBut there are just too many factors and so many faces come into my mind that I see through the year that are happy and tired.\u201d", "description": "Formula One champions Mercedes are wondering how far they can go after securing an unprecedented sixth successive title double in Japan on Sunday.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440696024&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0X7", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
