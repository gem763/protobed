The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.10%, meanwhile, slipped about 9 points. or 0.1%, to reach 8,094.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Dow lost 39.54 points, or 0.2%, to 26,788.10, the S&P 500 index fell 10.73 points, or 0.4%, to 2,995.99, while the Nasdaq shed 58.69 points, or 0.7%, to 8,104.30.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nResults from Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.23% and Boeing Co. BA, +2.70% initially knocked the market lower in premarket action on Wednesday, with investors already unsettled from Brexit developments and weakness among chip companies. But stocks turned higher in early trading as investors took positives away from quarterly results from the blue-chip components.\n\nCaterpillar cut its full-year 2019 earnings outlook as it reported third-quarter results that also missed Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates.\n\nThat came amid a slide for the semiconductor sector following a poor forecast from Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, -5.99% that was much worse than expected in a late-Tuesday earnings report, with new revenue estimate range that fell as much as a half-billion dollars below Wall Street\u2019s consensus revenue estimate.\n\nSee also: Texas Instruments tanks the chip sector and investors\u2019 hopes for a rebound\n\nOverall, however, earnings from American companies have been better than feared, albeit off lowered expectations. Thus far, of the 98 companies that have reported third-quarter results in the S&P 500, 82.7% have delivered results above analyst expectations, while 12.2% reported below analyst expectations, according to research provider Refinitiv. By comparison, 65% tend to \u201cbeat\u201d estimates, and 20% fall below consensus estimates, according to Refinitiv data going back to 1994.\n\nMeanwhile, Parliament\u2019s rejection of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s legislative schedule for Brexit reduced the likelihood of a departure by Oct. 31 or a no-deal exit from the EU. The U.K. government has already asked for an extension to the end of January 2020, and European Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter that he would recommend that request is granted.\n\nIn a light day for U.S. economic data, the Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s house price index for August was 0.2% higher for the month, bringing annual price gains to 4.6%.\n\nFor investors, this week is all about earnings, even with a critical Federal Reserve meeting set to kick off in less than a week, said Kate Warne, principal investment strategist with Edward Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s not just results,\u201d she said, \u201cbut outlook and commentary.\u201d\n\nFor example, Boeing earnings also missed estimates and deliveries of new planes fell short, but revenues beat forecasts. However, the manufacturer said it expects the beleaguered 737 MAX to return to service in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cInvestors have been more concerned about slowing growth, which is reasonable, but I think there\u2019s been an overdose of pessimism about how resilient consumers are,\u201d Warne said. She pointed out that Q3 earnings have a tough year-over-year comparison, since corporations got a boost from the late-2017 tax cuts last year. From that perspective, results that are slightly better than expected is solid, the strategist said.\n\n\u201cIn an environment of job growth, ultralow interest rates and central-bank stimulus, this is actually an okay environment and one in which you need to be putting money into stocks because they can continue to go higher,\u201d she said.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nCaterpillar CAT, -0.23% cut its full-year 2019 earnings outlook as it reported third-quarter results that also missed Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimates.

NKE, -2.30% shares were down 2.4% after the sports apparel company late Tuesday reported that longtime CEO Mark Parker was stepping down, effective January of next year.
