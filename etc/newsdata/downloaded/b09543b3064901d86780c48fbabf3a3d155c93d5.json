She joined the Guardian in 1990, becoming the first female editor of Weekend magazine before she was 30. She wrote for the Independent from 1999 until 2009 before returning to the Guardian as a columnist for almost a decade, then joining the i newspaper in 2018. In the same year she struck a deal to write her first book, a memoir, which is due to be published early next year.\n\nHer friend Catherine Bennett, the Observer columnist, described her as \u201cone of the cleverest, most unconventional, most fearless people on the planet\u201d.\n\nOrr, who was separated from the novelist Will Self, had first been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. She learned of its return in August \u2013 an experience that she relayed to friends with defiant detail and pitch-black humour.\n\nDuring her time as editor of Weekend, she became known for her unflinching approach. She published a regular column by Oscar Moore about living with Aids at a time when misinformation and fear were a commonplace media response to HIV. She later defended her publication of extracts of Gordon Burn\u2019s investigation into the domestic lives of Fred and Rosemary West, Happy Like Murderers, emphasising the importance of writing that explored the bleakest corners of British experience.\n\nOrr\u2019s commitment to her profession was especially evidenced in the play Enquirer, an exploration of the newspaper industry through the real life testimony of 43 journalists, which she co-created for the National Theatre of Scotland in 2012. Friends say she considered it a vindication of the industry she cared so passionately about.\n\nThe play was memorably spiked with an anecdote that Orr contributed herself, about an anxiety dream she had while editing Weekend magazine, involving the botching of an exclusive cover interview with Bryan Ferry, and ending with her killing the singer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deborah Orr, pictured in 2011 Photograph: David Levene/for the Guardian\n\nThe novelist Andrew O\u2019Hagan, who became friends with Orr after writing for her at Weekend, told the Guardian: \u201cShe was completely inspiring and never knowingly not difficult, but beyond the ferocity, she had a huge heart.\u201d\n\nWhile Orr\u2019s refusal to suffer fools was legendary, O\u2019Hagan added: \u201cShe said what she thought, and it could be quite bracing, but it was always something she actually did think. She was outspoken, but the things she was speaking about were very original.\u201d\n\nPenny Martin, editor of The Gentlewoman magazine, which Orr contributed to later in her career, likewise recalled Orr\u2019s formidable reputation. \u201cI\u2019d heard about Deborah long before I met her \u2013 there are some wild stories about her fierce invective and withering put-downs. But she was enormously encouraging to this younger, less experienced Scottish editor. She\u2019s surely one of the funniest, clever journalists I\u2019ve met; a total force and a great dancer, as I remember.\u201d\n\nKatharine Viner, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, said that Orr was \u201ca brilliant, clever, funny writer and editor whose uncompromising and insightful approach to her work brought powerful journalism to the Guardian over many years.\u201d\n\nOrr\u2019s memoir, Motherwell, which is due to be published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson, is a tribute to her hometown and exploration of her tangled relationship with her mother, who railed against her daughter leaving behind the family\u2019s domestic orbit to move to university and then London. A recent Bookseller review, published the week before her death, was laden with superlatives, described it as \u201coutstanding\u201d and \u201cutterly riveting, blackly comic, and astonishingly honest\u201d. Though she was gravely ill, Orr had been delighted to see the piece.\n\nThe review also notes: \u201cHer scalpel is at its sharpest when she turns it on herself; on her foibles, and on her poor choices. For example, though still proudly working class, she is also quick to slice through her own inverted snobbery. \u2018The more humble my beginnings, the more I appeared to have achieved. I emphasised my lowly parents to feel prouder of myself,\u2019 she writes.\u201d\n\nBut Bennett said Orr was \u201cexceptional and generous, incapable of being boring or predictable\u201d \u2013 as well as being a gifted interior designer and gardener. She added: \u201cHer combination of perceptiveness and rationality was an ornament to public life, something we couldn\u2019t afford to lose, and yet she\u2019s gone. At least there is her book.\u201d", "description": "Former Guardian Weekend editor remembered by friends and colleagues as \u2018one of the cleverest, most unconventional, most fearless people\u2019", "authors": ["Deborah Orr"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95db6b756595c353288d04b3a40e6902c656600/0_795_6563_3934/master/6563.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f530fbffc6c9b067f4fd70c0bf3c95a3", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
