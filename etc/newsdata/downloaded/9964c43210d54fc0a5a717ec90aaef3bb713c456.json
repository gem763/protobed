But abandoning him was never actually an option: The promise of a political revolution is worth supporting a 78-year-old who just suffered a myocardial infarction. Even if the worst were to happen\u2014Sanders getting sick or even dying in office, a possibility with any president\u2014America would still have elected him, some supporters argued. His appointees would be in place. The revolution would live on. \u201cNot me, us,\u201d as Sanders\u2019s campaign mantra goes.\n\nNews of Sanders\u2019s heart attack came on October 4\u2014three days after the campaign announced that the senator had experienced chest pain during a stop in Las Vegas and had two stents inserted to fix a blocked coronary artery. That it took three days for his team to confirm the heart attack brought on questions about the seriousness of his condition, as well as more scrutiny on an already highly scrutinized aspect of Sanders\u2019s candidacy: his age. If elected, Sanders would be the oldest president in history; he\u2019d be 82 years old by the end of his first term.\n\nBut the Sanders supporters I spoke with at the watch party, hunched over heaping plates of chicken wings and mozzarella sticks, were unruffled. His age didn\u2019t disqualify him before, they said, and it doesn\u2019t now.\n\n\u201cA lot of [candidates] are in their 70s,\u201d Spitz said with a shrug, referring to Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, who are 70 and 76 years old, respectively. Plus, he explained, low voter turnout was a major factor in Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Donald Trump in 2016. \u201cYou want to have a candidate that's attractive to young people,\u201d Spitz said, \u201cand that\u2019s Bernie.\u201d\n\nAndrew Parr, the organizer of last night\u2019s event, who lives in Arlington and works in export control, told me he was worried about Sanders\u2019s long-term health \u201cfor about three seconds\u201d before learning that the senator had undergone a relatively common procedure. \u201cIt\u2019s not a showstopper,\u201d Parr said. He added that he simply doesn\u2019t trust any other Democratic candidate to follow through on an ambitious progressive agenda. \u201cHe\u2019s an original,\u201d Parr said, noting he\u2019s \u201cnot willing to risk\u201d supporting another Democrat.\n\nRead: Why Millennial socialists aren\u2019t into Elizabeth Warren\n\nOnstage last night, Sanders tried to relieve any doubts among viewers about his condition. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Sanders told the audience at the beginning of the debate. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d\n\nOther attendees justified their continued support for the rumpled septuagenarian by emphasizing the larger implications of a Sanders 2020 win\u2014from filling judicial seats to appointing progressives to Cabinet posts. \u201cIt's not only a president that you're electing. You\u2019re electing everyone who's in positions of power,\u201d Alison Acker, a 39-year-old speech therapist, told me. \u201cIf [Sanders] were to die in office \u2026 he would have people that we can trust in all the positions doing all the rest of the work.\u201d", "description": "To the Bernie Sanders superfans watching last night\u2019s debate, the promise of a political revolution is well worth supporting a 78-year-old who just had a heart attack.", "authors": ["Elaine Godfrey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2RC1Y/facebook.jpg?1571232002", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
