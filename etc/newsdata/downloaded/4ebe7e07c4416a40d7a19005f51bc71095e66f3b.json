The pact is tentative and subject to change as Trump prepares to sit down with China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He later Friday.\n\nStocks jumped Friday after the news. Equities had advanced globally earlier in the day amid growing conviction that the U.S. and China would negotiate a trade truce. Trump tweeted earlier Friday that \u201cgood things\u201d were happening in the meetings \u2014 and that if the countries did reach an agreement, he would be able to sign it without a lengthy congressional approval process.\n\nOn Thursday and earlier Friday, Liu and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer held the first senior-level discussions between Washington and Beijing since a previous agreement fell apart in May and tariffs were raised in the months after. The world\u2019s two biggest economies have been trying for the past year and a half to settle their trade dispute.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "As part of the deal, China would agree to some agricultural concessions and the U.S. would provide some tariff relief", "authors": ["Jenny Leonard", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/china-trade.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
