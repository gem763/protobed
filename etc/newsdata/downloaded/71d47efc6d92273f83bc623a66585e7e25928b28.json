Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, calling the report \u201cstunningly inadequate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Air Force inspector general must open an immediate investigation to acquire the full accounting of taxpayers' dollars spent at Trump Turnberry \u2014 and how much that spending has increased since President Trump took office,\" Blumenthal said. \"At the same time, the Department of Defense inspector general should begin investigating illegal spending at Trump properties by every military service.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), who previously requested that the Pentagon Inspector General open up its own probe, told POLITICO he believes \"taxpayers have a right to know whether our armed forces are making decisions based on operational concerns or the President\u2019s private businesses\" and \"this report has not answered that key question.\"\n\n\"I will continue pressing for an independent investigation to determine whether the Air Force misused taxpayer dollars at the President\u2019s private resort,\" Peters added in a statement.\n\nThe Air Force report, however, concluded there has been no wrongdoing.\n\n\"This review found that existing guidance, and the processes used to apply that guidance, are sufficient,\" according to the 34-page Air Force report. \"However, the team concluded that educating aircrew on applicable regulations is a continuous process and [Air Mobility Command] can improve how it educates aircrew on travel regulations by incorporating lessons and discussion items into its aircraft commander training.\"\n\n\"Although the review found no instances of inappropriate decision-making by aircrews transiting Prestwick Airport and lodging in the local areas,\" the report concluded, \"the broad nature of existing guidance suggests some additional focused training would be of value to affirm the role of the aircrew in the process.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gives a press conference at his Trump Turnberry Resort in June 2016. | Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nIt further stipulated the broad guidance currently in place \"also requires those who make decisions about lodging to use sound judgment and reasoning, weighing multiple different criteria to make an informed decision based on the known conditions at the time.\"\n\nOf all the refueling stops over the last five years at Prestwick, where the U.S. military has a contract for refueling services, 77 percent, or 419 aircrews, stayed in hotels in the local Prestwick area. Some 17 percent, or 95 aircrews, stayed in hotels in Glasgow. And 6 percent, or 31 aircrews, stayed at the Turnberry resort, the report found.\n\nIt also detailed six instances when aircrews stayed longer than 24 hours at Turnberry.\n\n\"For five of those six aircrews,\" the Air Force found, \"their aircraft had maintenance issues that required repair. The sixth aircrew was delayed for operational reasons.\"\n\n\"The distribution is consistent with policy and guidance for selecting aircrew accommodations \u2014 and when aircrew are billeted outside the local Prestwick area, the distribution does not indicate a preference for any particular location,\" according to the report.\n\nEven so, the review is unlikely to satisfy many congressional Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe report utterly fails to address the many questions I have raised about the number and duration of stays by airmen at President Trump\u2019s personal resort, allowing him to use our military budget as his personal piggy bank,\u201d Blumenthal said in his statement.\n\n\u201cFrom what little information is provided,\" he added, \"it appears the number of stays at Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort dramatically increased as he became president \u2014 but the report glaringly omits exactly how much those stays increased and how much money has flowed from the Air Force to line Trump\u2019s pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost egregiously,\" he concluded, \"the report fails to include whether the Air Force has taken appropriate steps to prevent illegal payments and therefore provides no guidance on how the Air Force should adhere to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nMorning Defense Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington\u2019s national security apparatus.
