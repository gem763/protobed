Daniel Leal-Olivas/Pool via REUTERS\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had agreed a worse Brexit deal than his predecessor Theresa May, which was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament, after Britain and the EU agreed an amended agreement.\n\nLabour is likely to vote for a second referendum if it is added to any deal proposed by Johnson, a party source said, although it was keeping its options open until it knew exactly what Johnson would ask parliament to vote on.\n\nThe government intends to call lawmakers to a special sitting of the House of Commons on Saturday in the hope of getting the outlines of a new Brexit deal approved.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\n\u201cThis sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d\n\nCorbyn, who voted against Britain joining the EU back in 1975 and gave only reluctant backing to the \u201cremain\u201d campaign in the 2016 referendum, has previously only signaled lukewarm backing for another referendum.\n\nSaturday\u2019s sitting will take place against the backdrop of a large march through central London in favor of a second referendum.", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had agreed a worse Brexit deal than his predecessor Theresa May, which was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament, after Britain and the EU agreed an amended agreement.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441837513&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0RY", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
