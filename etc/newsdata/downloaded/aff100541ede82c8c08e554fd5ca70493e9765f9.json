But the American standout certainly made this one entertaining.\n\nFouling on his first two attempts and staring at elimination, he turned back into the Taylor of old to win the event over teammate and good friend Will Claye in a back-and-forth contest. Taylor\u2019s winning leap was 17.92 meters, with Claye just 0.18 meters behind.\n\nTaylor may be going for another three-peat next summer in Tokyo as he chases his third straight Olympic gold medal.\n\n\u201cReally my goal was to be a one-time world champion, one-time Olympic champ,\u201d said Taylor, who\u2019s now won four of the last five world titles. \u201cEverything else is icing on the cake. Now four times - it makes me feel old that I\u2019ve been doing this for so long.\u201d\n\nIt was just business as usual for Taylor in an event where the competitor tries to jump as far as possible by performing a hop, step, and a jump from a running start.\n\nAll he needed was a little pep talk Sunday to get back on track.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You belong here. Just slow down, relax and don\u2019t touch the board and get to the final,\u2019\u201d Taylor recounted.\n\nHe took his own advice to heart. On his fifth attempt of six, he turned in his best jump of the evening.\n\nWas that drama enough?\n\nHe said he\u2019s heard whispers about possibly taking the event off the Diamond League competition schedule, just to make the program more condensed.\n\n\u201cThis is what we need to keep the triple-jump alive,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHopefully the IAAF saw this, recognized that it was good for the fans. Hopefully, we had a big enough bang that that IAAF says, \u2018We\u2019ll keep you guys.\u2019\u201d\n\nJust don\u2019t ask him if winning ever gets old.\n\n\u201cNo. No, no, no, no,\u201d the 29-year-old Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not boring for me. Having those two fouls, I tried to play it cool. But my heart was racing.\u201d\n\nIt had to be the spikes. His new pair of custom-made Nikes was made in honor of NFL wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. Remember when Beckham did his triple-jump celebration after scoring a 75-yard touchdown for the News York Giants in 2016?\n\nTaylor sure does.\n\nTaylor had \u201cCDT\u201d on one side of the spikes - an ode to \u201cOBJ\u201d - and Beckham\u2019s No. 13 on the other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of his,\u201d said Taylor, who pointed out that he won on a night when Beckham\u2019s new team, the Cleveland Browns, played, and routed, Baltimore. \u201cThe play, the attitude, the swagger.\u201d\n\nFitting, the design on the spikes was in gold.\n\nOne of the first to congratulate him was Claye. They\u2019re fierce rivals on game days - they were teammates at the University of Florida - but fast friends away from the track.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the ranks together, trained together, been through the mud together,\u201d Claye explained. \u201cThis right here is another stop along the way. We\u2019ll always have that great relationship. We always have a mutual respect and love for each other.\u201d\n\nWithout Taylor in his way, Claye could have a lot more hardware. Claye finished runner-up to Taylor at the last two Olympic Games.\n\n\u201cBut if he wasn\u2019t around, I\u2019m probably not doing track,\u201d Claye countered. \u201cIf I won those golds, I\u2019d be like, \u2018I got everything I wanted from the sport.\u2019 I\u2019d probably be doing something else now. The chip on my shoulder that\u2019s growing each and every year is going to amount to something very special.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "This has almost become nothing but a formality: Crowning Christian Taylor as the world triple-jump champion.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/qatar_athletics_worlds_46430_c0-252-3281-2164_s1770x1032.jpg?e4f2fa65fd7a9115e3dafad2476d52d0b5c15b5b", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
