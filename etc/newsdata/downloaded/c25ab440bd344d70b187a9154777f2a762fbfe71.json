I was pushing from the beginning because our strategy was clear,\u201d Marquez said.\n\n\u201cThis time I tried to open the gap from the beginning because I felt very strong in the warm up.\u201d\n\nHe said he lost focus during the race when he realised his bike was burning through fuel too quickly, forcing him to \u201cplay a lot with switches\u201d.\n\nBut Marquez was never directly threatened and enjoyed a two second gap ahead of Quartararo through most of the second half.\n\nHe had already secured his season victory by winning the Thailand Grand Prix earlier this month.\n\nHis victory at Motegi also secured Honda\u2019s 25th constructors\u2019 championship overall and its fourth on the trot.\n\nQuartararo finished with his third narrow defeat to the championship winner in recent races but was left smiling after winning the Rookie of the Year award.\n\n\u201cMarc was super fast today,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cI really pushed at my 100 percent to try to stay with him.\u201d\n\nHe was also fending off pressure from Dovizioso, whose late charge fell just short.\n\n\u201cDovi was unbelievably fast. He was riding more than a half second faster than me,\u201d Quartararo said.\n\nDovizioso, marking his 100th career podium finish, said he struggled to find his form until late in the race, where he could only compete for the possible second.\n\n\u201cI was pushing so hard, but it was a bit over the limit. I wanted to (win) second, but it was not enough,\u201d the Italian said.\n\n\u201cWe struggled a bit during the weekend,\u201d he said.\n\nMonster Energy Yamaha\u2019s Marverick Vinales finished fourth ahead of LCR Honda\u2019s Cal Cruthlow and Quartararo\u2019s teammate Franco Morbidelli.\n\n\u2013 Phillip Island beckons \u2013\n\nMarquez said he was eager for next weekend\u2019s race in Australia, where he won in 2017 and 2015, but noted that Yamaha bikes tend to excel on the Phillip Island circuit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite tracks. I enjoy a lot, riding there,\u201d Marquez said.\n\n\u201cLong corners, traction, very fast corners. Yamaha normally are very fast there,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cVinales is very normally very fast. Quartararo will be very fast.\u201d\n\nDovizioso is currently second in the world standings but missed the chance to lock in a runner-up championship finish with three more races left in the season.", "description": "Motegi (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez won the Japan Grand Prix Sunday to notch his tenth victory of the season and earn Honda", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/bf4870_marquez-was-unassailable-lap-in-his-pole-start-motegi-twin-circuit-champion-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
