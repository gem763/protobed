The appearance of seeking work was more important than the actuality,' he said.\n\nThe Sydney resident descended from the middle class in the aftermath of his 17-year relationship breaking down.\n\nThe Sydney resident (pictured) descended from the middle class during the aftermath of his 17-year relationship breaking down\n\nHe received unemployment benefits for a year, but needed them once more for a further three months when the newspaper he began editing collapsed in December 2018.\n\nIn exchange for $695 a fortnight- which included rent assistance- the now-employed freelancer was required to send 20 job applications a month.\n\nAfter he paid rent for his small one-bedroom apartment in the city's west, he was left with just $15 to spend over two weeks.\n\nIn a Facebook post (pictured), Mr Mordue said he was relieved to be employed again and to stand up against the 'misadventures' and 'miseries' he had gone through\n\nIn a Facebook post, Mr Mordue said he was relieved to be employed again and to stand up against the 'misadventures' and 'miseries' he had gone through.\n\n'It was very important to me to go before the Senate group \u2013 and speak up about the ugly and abusive truths that are wreaking havoc on the unemployed and perpetuating all kinds of awful problems in this country of ours,' it read.\n\nThe inquiry also heard from other Newstart recipients that had negative experiences as they struggled to make ends meet.\n\nOne, a 56-year-old man with twenty years experience in IT and post graduate qualification, was required to do 650 hours of work for the dole - which is more than the community service allocated to offenders for a year.\n\nMore than half of Newstart recipients are over 45 and earn $277.85 a week or $39 a day\n\nAnother who lost her job while struggling with depression and now lives off Newstart and the money earned from working just one day a week, lives minimally off $57 a day.\n\nShe could only afford four meals a week and couldn't take her dog to the vet, and failed to find employment despite 400 applications resulting in 50 interviews over 18 months.\n\nMore than half of Newstart recipients are over 45 and earn $277.85 a week or $39 a day.\n\nThe inquiry comes amid calls on the Federal Government from various industries to increase the payment.\n\nMental Health Australia addressed parliament earlier this week over concerns the low income support could be affecting the mental health of those dependent on the system to survive.", "description": "Award winning journalist Mark Mordue has slammed Centrelink after the government agency forced him to apply for ten jobs in two weeks despite already having one lined up.", "authors": ["Tita Smith For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/09/19579334-0-image-a-2_1570784260806.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
