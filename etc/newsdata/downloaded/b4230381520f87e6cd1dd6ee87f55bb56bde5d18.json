These included deals made through a team of independent Nigerian sales consultants called J-Force. The transactions in question amounted to 2% of 2018 gross merchandise volume - a term for sales used in online retailing - rising to 4% in the first quarter of 2019.\n\n\n\nJ-Force allows the company to interact directly with customers but \"requires constant improvement,\" Jumia co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Sacha Poignonnec said in a conference call.\n\nThe retailer - sometimes dubbed Africa\u2019s Amazon - has operations in 14 countries and is seeking to take advantage of rising incomes and better technology on the continent.\n\n'Unlimited income'\n\nIn advertising for candidates to join J-Force, Jumia promises the opportunity to \u201cearn unlimited income\u201d while having \u201ccomplete freedom and control over your activities.\u201d Nigeria is ranked 144th on a list of 180 countries on the Corruption Perceptions Index, compiled by Transparency International.\n\nThe report of dubious sales practices comes after Citron called Jumia \u201can obvious fraud,\u201d wiping out early gains from the IPO. The stock shed another 14% to $12.73 as of 12:39 p.m. in New York, dropping below the $14.50 listing price.\n\nJumia said second-quarter operating losses widened by 60% to 66.7 million euros, mainly due to an increase in costs related to the vesting of share options following the IPO. The company\u2019s target for profitability is late 2022, and the cash raised through the listing should take Jumia \u201cclose\u201d to that, Poignonnec said.\n\nThe \u201cbusiness model has severe vulnerabilities,\u201d Tellimer Markets Inc analysts led by Nirgunan Tiruchelvam said in a note following the results. \u201cThe business is intensely cashflow negative and we have concerns about its viability.\u201d", "description": "Jumia Technologies AG has identified improper transactions at the Africa-focused online retailer\u2019s Nigeria business that amounted to as much as 4% of first-quarter sales.", "authors": ["John Bowker", "Loni Prinsloo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8746/6cb78d5e3c094896a8f02ec4e270dc95.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
