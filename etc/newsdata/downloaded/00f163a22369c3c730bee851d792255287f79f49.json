It\u2019s set on a collision course with Tokyo and the wider Kanto region, which is set to experience record-breaking rain and winds. The storm is due to make landfall on Saturday evening.\n\nFears have been raised that the storm, which is generating gusts of up to 145mph, could match the fury of the 1958 Kanogawa Typhoon, one of the deadliest on record, which killed more than 1,200 people when it hit Japan\u2019s Shizuoka Prefecture.\n\nWith the worst-hit areas of the Honshu island set to be deluged by close to three feet of rain in a 24-hour period, the Japan Meteorological Agency has issued emergency warnings of flooding, mudslides and storm surges as high as 42 feet along the coast. Tokyo is predicted to see two feet of downpour.\n\nFlights in and out of the country have seen extensive disruption so far, with Tokyo\u2019s two main airports subject to the most cancellations. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines have collectively cancelled more than 1,000 flights scheduled for Saturday, both domestic and international. Multiple airports throughout the country, including those serving Tokyo, Osaka and Sendai, have also cancelled flights.\n\nRailway operators have suspended service throughout the Tokyo region, as well as bullet train service between the capital and Osaka and between Osaka and Fukuoka, on the island of Kyushu.\n\nTokyo Disneyland has shut its theme park, its first weather-related closure since a snowstorm in 1984. The retail giant Seven & I Holdings said it would shut 124 outlets in the Tokyo area. Toyota Motor Corp also announced on Friday it was suspending production at three factories in the country.\n\nIn Tokyo, where the streets have quietened and public transport services ground to a virtual standstill, tannoy announcements have been made across the city recommending residents to stay indoors. Many department stores in and around the capital have decided to halt trade for the day. Evacuations have also been ordered in Kawasaki, one of the main districts forming the Greater Tokyo Area.\n\nBut as a city used to typhoons and built to withstand their effects, central Tokyo looks to be prepared for the coming storm.\n\nGeorge Beadle, a visiting England fan, said on Saturday morning he was struck by the initial sense of calm within the capital on Saturday morning. \u201cEven this morning in torrential rain the supermarkets and shops are still open with people cycling down the road,\u201d he said from his accommodation in Shinjuku. \u201cThe only difference seems to be a shortage of water and breads in the supermarkets.\u201d\n\nThe greater concern to life is away from the central cities and storm-proof areas. In the Chiba Prefecture, which was last month hit by Typhoon Faxai, thousands have sought cover at emergency evacuation centres, taking refuge in schools, temples, and other municipal buildings. Japan Meteorological Agency has warned that houses in the region could be blown over in the violent winds.\n\nSome supermarkets had ran out of bottled water and batteries by Friday afternoon, after officials advised residents in the area to prepare supplies for up to three days. The Chiba Prefecture, which lies to the east of Tokyo, remains particularly vulnerable to the oncoming storm, having yet to fully recover from the effects of Faxai which damaged buildings and left 900,000 people without power.\n\nTyphoon Hagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, has already forced the cancellation of two matches at the Rugby World Cup \u2013 England\u2019s clash with France and New Zealand\u2019s encounter against Italy \u2013 while the Pool A decider between Japan and Scotland remains on red alert.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, the typhoon was considered the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane under the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale used in the United States.", "description": "Typhoon Hagibis, the strongest storm to hit Japan in decades, has begun reaping devastation along the Pacific coast of the country\u2019s main island, with residents in the most vulnerable areas taking shelter in evacuation centres amid rising flood levels and violent winds which have left one man dead.", "authors": ["Samuel Lovett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/12/04/typhoon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
