Senior army generals and Mugabe's wife and children followed, as a brass band played.\n\nThe 60,000 seater stadium was only half-filled.\n\nIn a tribute to his predecessor, Mnangagwa said Mugabe stood in defense of Africans. He urged the West to remove sanctions that were imposed during Mugabe's rule.\n\n\"We who remain shall continue to hear his rich, brave, defiant and inspiring voice ... encouraging and warning us to be vigilant and astute,\" Mnangagwa said in a speech.\n\n\"A giant tree of Africa has fallen. Today Africa weeps.\"\n\nMnangagwa and the ruling ZANU-PF party wanted Mugabe buried at the national shrine to heroes of the 15-year liberation war against white minority rule. But some relatives, expressing bitterness at the way former comrades ousted Mugabe, had pushed for him to be buried in his home village.\n\nWalter Chidhakwa, who spoke on behalf of Mugabe's family, said Mugabe was an icon who was determined and unflinching in pursuing policies like land reform and later the black economic empowerment program.\n\nMugabe left behind a country wrecked by hyperinflation, dollarization and deeply entrenched corruption.\n\nBut many Zimbabweans also remember Mugabe as their country's liberator from white minority rule and for broadening people's access to education and land.\n\n\n\n\n\nRAMAPHOSA BOOED\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa was booed by the crowd in the stadium after a wave of deadly riots and xenophobic attacks in South Africa earlier this month that triggered international anger. The attacks mainly targeted shops owned by African migrants.\n\nThe master of ceremony was forced to appeal to the crowd to give Ramaphosa a chance to speak.\n\n\"I stand before you as a fellow African to express my regret and to apologize for what has happened in our country,\" Ramaphosa said, to cheering from the crowd.\n\nKenya's Uhuru Kenyatta called Mugabe an intellectual giant, \"a visionary leader and a relentless champion of African dignity.\"\n\nOther heads of state who attended Saturday's funeral included long-ruling leaders from Equatorial Guinea and Congo while China, Russia and Cuba, which supported Zimbabwe's liberation movements that fought white minority rule, were represented by officials.\n\nProminent officials from Western countries, which were critical of Mugabe's rule, did not feature in the official funeral program.\n\nMnangagwa led heads of state in viewing Mugabe's body, which was followed by a military 21-gun salute to honor Mugabe.\n\nBanners at the stadium where Mugabe's body lay in state read \"Hamba kahle, Gushungo,\" (go well, Gushungo)\", a reference to his clan name, and \"Go well our revolutionary icon\".\n\nCleo Mapuranga, a caterer, told Reuters that Mugabe fought to give land and economic freedom to blacks and provided non-racial education.\n\n\"Now, people are suffering. No one is controlling the prices in the shops. Our finance minister is trying to implement first-world policies which don't work in third-world countries.\"\n\nMugabe's death has made some Zimbabweans question what Mnangagwa has achieved in his two years in power.\n\nHis government has taken steps to cut the budget deficit, remove subsidies on fuel and power and repeal laws curbing public and media freedoms, but those reforms and austerity measures have compounded ordinary people's hardships.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Alexander Winning; Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo, Catherine Evans and Mark Potter)", "description": "Zimbabwe's founder Robert Mugabe was honored as an icon, principled leader and African intellectual giant at a state funeral on Saturday, after a week of disputes over his burial threatened to embarrass President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
