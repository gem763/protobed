(AP) \u2014 Israel Mukuamu returned the first of his three interceptions 53 yards for a touchdown and South Carolina took advantage of Jake Fromm\u2019s four turnovers to beat No. 3 Georgia 20-17 in double overtime on Saturday.\n\nParker White\u2019s 23-yard field goal in the second overtime proved to be enough when Georgia\u2019s Rodrigo Blankenship was wide left on his attempt from 42 yards. Blankenship\u2019s second miss of the game sent South Carolina players charging onto the field to celebrate the upset.\n\nGeorgia (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) suffered a big hit to its national championship hopes. The Bulldogs, favored by 24\u00bd points, could not overcome three interceptions and a lost fumble by Fromm, the senior quarterback known for avoiding mistakes. Fromm did not throw an interception in the Bulldogs\u2019 first five games.\n\nOn the second play of overtime, Fromm\u2019s pass glanced off the hands of receiver Tyler Simmons and was intercepted by Mukuamu. White\u2019s 33-yard field-goal attempt missed wide right to keep the game alive.\n\nFromm led Georgia on a tying 96-yard touchdown drive capped by his 6-yard scoring pass to Demetris Robertson with less than two minutes remaining in regulation.\n\nWhite, who made a 49-yard field goal in the first half, missed a 57-yarder with 40 seconds remaining to give the Bulldogs one final possession in regulation.\n\nFromm moved the Bulldogs to the South Carolina 38, in possible position for Blankenship to attempt a game-winning field goal. But an illegal shift penalty pushed Georgia back five yards, ending the field-goal possibility as regulation ended.\n\nSouth Carolina (3-3, 2-2) took its first win over a ranked opponent since beating No. 18 Tennessee in 2016. It was an important signature win for coach Will Muschamp over his alma mater.\n\nThe Gamecocks won despite losing quarterback Ryan Hilinski to an apparent knee injury.\n\nHilinski completed 15 of 20 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game after a late hit in the third quarter. Georgia linebacker Adam Anderson was penalized for roughing the passer.\n\nFromm threw no interceptions on 111 passes through five games, but his first giveaway in the second quarter was costly.\n\nPressure from the South Carolina defense forced Fromm to attempt a pass off his back foot. The floater from Fromm, intended for George Pickens, was intercepted by Mukuamu, whose 53-yard return gave the Gamecocks the lead.\n\nWith Georgia driving for a potential tying touchdown, Fromm fumbled the first snap of the fourth quarter. T.J. Brunson recovered for the Gamecocks at the South Carolina 29.\n\nMukuamu\u2019s second interception stopped Georgia, again in South Carolina territory, in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Gamecocks\u2019 17-10 lead held when senior Rodrigo Blankenship\u2019s 53-yard field goal attempt on the last play of the half was deflected by D.J. Wonnum. It was Blankenship\u2019s first miss of the season.\n\nHilinski, the freshman from Orange, California, who was recruited by Georgia, enjoyed a strong first half, completing 13 of 16 passes. Hilinski\u2019s 46-yard touchdown pass to Bryan Edwards in the first quarter gave the Gamecocks a 7-3 lead.\n\nD\u2019Andre Swift had a 1-yard scoring run early in the second quarter.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nSouth Carolina: There was no immediate report on the severity of Hilinski\u2019s injury. He pounded the grass for several minutes until being helped off the field. He watched the remainder of the game on the South Carolina bench. \u2026 LT Sadarius Hutcherson was helped off the field early in the fourth.\n\nGeorgia: Defensive back Mark Webb left the game in the third quarter with a left knee injury. \u2026 WR Lawrence Cager appeared to aggravate a left shoulder injury when making a third-down catch in the second quarter. Cager returned to make another catch but left the game for good with injured ribs.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks gave up 468 total yards but showed surprising strength to contain Georgia\u2019s SEC-leading rushing attack. The Bulldogs averaged 250 yards rushing before being held to 173. The Gamecocks remained poised after Joyner replaced Hilinski.\n\nGeorgia: The Bulldogs expected to have a commanding advantage on each line, but they could not wear down South Carolina\u2019s defense as they had against previous opponents. Instead, attempts by D\u2019Andre Swift and other backs to run at the heart of the Gamecocks\u2019 defense had less success during the game.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nGeorgia, tied with Ohio State at No. 3, is headed for a fall in the next Top 25.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouth Carolina: The Gamecocks face their second straight top-10 team when they return home to play No. 7 Florida next week. South Carolina has won five of the last nine in the series.\n\nGeorgia: The Bulldogs will play another home game against an SEC East rival when Kentucky visits on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "description": "ATHENS, Ga.
