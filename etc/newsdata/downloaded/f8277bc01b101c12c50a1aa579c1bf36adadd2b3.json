The Soviet spy service was in his heart and in his blood. His father worked for the intelligence service all his life, and wore his KGB uniform every day, including weekends. The Gordievskys lived amid the spy fraternity in a designated apartment block, ate special food reserved for officers, and spent their free time socializing with other spy families. Gordievsky was a child of the KGB,\u201d Mr. Macintyre writes in the beginning of the book.\n\nThe author notes that the KGB \u2014 the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnnosti, or Committee for State Security \u2014 was the most complex and far-reaching intelligence agency ever created. The KGB had the role of both foreign and domestic intelligence gathering, as well as internal security enforcement and state police. The KGB controlled every aspect of life in the Soviet Union.\n\nGordievsky moved up the chain in the KGB to become the \u201crezident,\u201d the senior KGB intelligence officer in London, working out of the Soviet embassy. For more than 10 years he was also working as a double agent for the British.\n\nAs Mr. Macintyre points out in his outstanding book, Gordievsky became disillusioned with Soviet communism while posted in Copenhagen. The Soviet police state paled in comparison to the freedom of the West. His disillusionment became total after the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 and he decided to spy for the British.\n\nHis intelligence was so valuable that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan were given briefings on Gordievsky\u2019s insights into the KGB and Soviet political leadership. The CIA was not told who the Brit spy was, so they launched an investigation to learn who the valuable British asset was.\n\nUnbeknown to the CIA at the time, one of their own, CIA counterintelligence officer Aldrich Ames, was a spy for the KGB.\n\n\u201cTwelve days before Gordievsky was due to take over as rezident, Aldrich Ames offered his services to the KGB,\u201d Mr. Macintyre writes. \u201cHe felt underappreciated by the CIA. But he would later offer a simpler explanation for his actions: \u2018I did it for the money.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe needed to pay for Rosario\u2019s shopping trips to Neiman Marcus and dinners at the Palm restaurant. He wanted to move out of his one-bedroom apartment, pay off his ex-wife, hold an expensive wedding, and own his car outright. The Soviets gave Ames $4.6 million. Ames chose to sell out America to the KGB in order to buy the American Dream he felt he deserved. Gordievsky had never been interested in the money. Ames was interested in nothing else.\u201d\n\nAfter being tipped by Ames, the KGB became suspicious of Gordievsky. He was interrogated, drugged and kept under surveillance in Moscow, but he had not yet been arrested and charged with espionage. The British had earlier developed a plan to exfiltrate Gordievsky from Russia when he felt the day had come. Now he sent a message to the British to rescue him and the daring operation to pull him out of the Soviet Union began.\n\nWhile working in Copenhagen, Gordievsky had supplied intelligence on the KGB\u2019s Scandinavian operations. In London, he had provided information that affected strategic thinking in 10 Downing Street and the White House. Much of his information had not been fully used, as it would have been incriminating. Now safely in British hands with the operational case ended, Gordievsky\u2019s 11 years of intelligence was exploited to the full.\n\nAlthough Ben Macintyre compares Gordievsky to Ames, the former KGB officer and defector is perhaps the other side of the coin to Kim Philby, the British spy and traitor who defected to the Soviets in 1963. Gordievsky was in a sense the U.K.\u2019s return shot to the KGB after their success with Philby. (Ben Macintyre also wrote a book about Philby called \u201cA Spy Among Friends.\u201d)\n\nLike \u201cA Spy Among Friends\u201d and Ben Macintyre\u2019s other books on the world of intelligence, such as \u201cAgent Zigzag\u201d and \u201cOperation Mincemeat,\u201d \u201cThe Spy and the Traitor\u201d offers suspense and action and reads like a thriller.\n\nThe book is well-researched and well-written, and it is a must for students of espionage.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE SPY AND THE TRAITOR\n\nBy Ben Macintyre\n\nBroadway Books, $18, 384 pages (paperback)\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
