On Tuesday, the cable network published audio, provided to it by Cohen\u2019s attorney, of Trump and his former fixer discussing purchasing the rights to former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal\u2019s story alleging she had an affair with Trump.\n\nAmerican Media Inc. (AMI), the parent company of the National Enquirer, owns the rights to the story. And David Pecker, a longtime Trump ally, helmed AMI. But, according to a source familiar with the Trump-Cohen conversation, Pecker had told Trump he was considering leaving AMI, prompting fears in Trumpland that a new leader at the company could decide to publish McDougal\u2019s story. Such fears prompted Trump and Cohen to look into buying the rights to the story themselves, according to the source. Ultimately, Pecker stayed at AMI and Trump opted not to purchase the story rights.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s attorney, told The Daily Beast he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the discussion between Trump and Pecker. A spokesperson for AMI did not respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nAfter audio of the call surfaced, the president conveyed to those close to him that he felt betrayed by Cohen. He was particularly irate at being clandestinely recorded and that audio had found its way to, of all places, CNN, a frequent target of Trump\u2019s tweets. Trump also vented his frustration that there are apparently other tapes out there, and that he doesn\u2019t know exactly what could be on them, or when they\u2019ll drop in the press.\n\nOn Thursday evening that next shoe dropped, only it wasn't in the form of an audio recording. CNN (again) reported that Cohen was willing to attest that Trump had lied when he claimed he had no prior knowledge of the infamous campaign meeting his eldest son helped organized with Russians at Trump Tower.\n\nGiuliani denied the latest allegation to CNN and called Cohen a chronic liar. But the episode is likely to further anger the president, who has been simmering over the Cohen matter for days.\n\nIn his three most recent tweets about his former lawyer, Trump has declined to write \u201cMichael\u201d or \u201cCohen,\u201d as he has in other tweets about him this year. The slight is not by accident, according to multiple people who have known Trump for years. The president, they say, will often stop using people\u2019s names if he\u2019s convinced they\u2019re turncoats, or if he suddenly finds them big enough \u201closers\u201d not worth the attention.\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump continued using this tactic, referring to his former loyalist as \u201che,\u201d \u201chim,\u201d and \u201csomeone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary\u2019s lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!\u201d the president posted to Twitter.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead to each other [now],\u201d said another source close to the president who also knows Cohen.\n\nTrump allies are already gaming out how to, in the words of one outside adviser to the president, \u201cbury\u201d Cohen.\n\nA Cohen ally brushed off the impending attacks, calling Giuliani and his associates \u201cthe gang who can\u2019t shoot straight.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, Cohen referred The Daily Beast to his lawyer Lanny Davis. Davis said Cohen is not concerned about any coming attacks from the president\u2019s allies and surrogates. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got truth on your side, you\u2019re not afraid of anything,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what are they afraid of?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Michael Cohen came to me, I spent two weeks asking him about what he had done in the past for Mr. Trump and what he wanted to do in the future,\u201d Davis continued. \u201cI decided to represent him after hearing the answers to both of those questions and listening and watching what he was willing to say on TV to George Stephanopoulos. That\u2019s when I made my decision. He has hit the reset button, he\u2019s made a turn\u2014to be on his own, speaking the truth.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Cohen\u2019s associates have told The Daily Beast that Cohen\u2014who for years publicly branded himself as the ultimate Trump loyalist\u2014chose to publicize elements of his relationship with Trump once he realized that his loyalty would not be reciprocated.\n\nMany were surprised it took him so long to realize this. The president passed over Cohen for a plum administration gig\u2014Cohen had told friends he expected to be tapped as White House chief of staff\u2014and displayed a nasty habit of making Cohen appear like a nuisance among peers.\n\nTwo sources with direct knowledge of Trump and Cohen\u2019s relationship over the years tell The Daily Beast that during the 2016 presidential run, Cohen would often wander into rooms in Trump Tower where the GOP frontrunner and his senior advisers were having meetings on political strategy and other campaign-related matters. Cohen, according to these sources, would try to interject, only to have Trump tell him to leave and say they\u2019d talk later. \u201cGet out, Michael,\u201d Trump ordered during one particular moment of annoyance.\n\nThrough it all, Cohen remained a committed Trump ally. But in the months after the feds raided his office, he began to feel abandoned by the president. The sense that he could be left as a potential fall-guy ultimately convinced him to go on offense.\n\nCohen has told associates he believes there is no going back on his latest moves, and that he expects to be finished with the president for the rest of his life.\n\n\u201cHe has\u2026 made his peace with the loss of his friend,\u201d one friend of Cohen assessed.\n\nIt\u2019s been a staggering reversal for someone who had said as recently as April that he\u2019d \u201crather jump out of a building than turn on Donald Trump.\u201d At the time, a senior White House official joked, \u201cHow tall is the building?\u201d\u2014reflecting a widely held perception of Cohen as a supplicant whose utility wasn\u2019t all that evident. Now, the words often used to describe the former Trump lawyer are \u201csnitch,\u201d \u201cweakling,\u201d and \u201ctraitor,\u201d with Trump allies saying it won\u2019t be hard to portray Cohen as a hypocrite, opportunist, or criminal.\n\nCohen has certainly given his enemies fodder. Upon Trump\u2019s election, he tried to make a financial killing through a secret \u201cshadow lobbying\u201d effort. When that effort blew up spectacularly with the publication of private client lists, Cohen found himself further in trouble with federal investigators. Those clients could now find themselves enduring even more embarrassing headlines.\n\n\u201cOne doesn\u2019t have to speculate too hard to think that some of Michael Cohen\u2019s other clients are going to be very, very angry when they find out they\u2019re possibly on tape,\u201d said a source familiar with his track record.\n\nBut not everyone in Trump\u2019s orbit thinks it\u2019s a wise idea to go to war. Former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA), a prominent Trump surrogate and a friend of Cohen\u2019s, told The Daily Beast that he felt \u201csorry\u201d for the former Trump hand.\n\n\u201cIt would appear to me that if I\u2019m [White House chief of staff John] Kelly, I would say to the president, \u2018Do not talk to Michael Cohen anymore, it\u2019s not in your interest,\u2019\u201d Kingston added. \u201cBut I would have someone else talk to Michael Cohen\u2026so he wouldn\u2019t feel like he was out on a limb, and that the limb was being sawed off.\u201d\n\nEdit: This story has been updated throughout.", "description": "This could get ugly.", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "Betsy Swan", "White House Reporter", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1532646139/180726-swin-cohen-trump-tease_brgcqd", "published_at": "2018-07-27"}
