He will know how it feels to be one of the All Blacks on Saturday morning. He will know what it is to wake up each day with a target on his back.\n\nIn the years when Woods was, indisputably, the greatest golfer in the world, that was a feeling he must have grown used to: opening his eyes and immediately recalling that there were 140 or so rivals looking to take him down. Every day, every round. That's pressure.\n\nSo when the All Blacks take the field in Yokohama on Saturday, they will be hyper-aware of what is at stake. The greatest team in rugby, arguably in modern sport, did not need Eddie Jones to remind them what they have to lose at this World Cup. Not just the kudos and achievement of winning the trophy for a third straight time - unprecedented, as was their retention in 2015 - but their status at the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nTiger Woods understands what it is like to have a target on his back when taking on his rivals\n\nThe All Blacks have long sent the tone in rugby as they try to make history while out in Japan\n\nLike Woods in his prime, New Zealand have stood a long time at the summit; the team against which all others must be judged. When Jones talked about making England the best in the world it was very obvious this would have to include a mastering of the All Blacks.\n\nOnce the draw for this competition was made in May 2017 it was plain that would have to be done at this competition, in either the semi-final or final.\n\nAll week, Jones has been chipping away at New Zealand's aura of invincibility, yet on Saturday the conversation stops.\n\nUltimately, Woods was defeated by the toll on his own body. Had he remained healthy who knows when he would have been taken down? Jones and England are going to have to do it the hard way.\n\n'You can't be the man, unless you beat the man,' as Maro Itoje had it.\n\nNew Zealand are entering uncharted waters as the All Blacks look to extend their dominance\n\nThe All Blacks are looking to make it three Rugby World Cup titles in a row in Japan this year\n\nAt a hotel adjacent to the mushrooming Olympic Stadium - the All Blacks have worked very hard on their image on this trip and the setting seemed part of that - Ian Foster was considering what has forged the greatest team in the world.\n\nWoods was a self-starter, it was all about him.\n\nThe All Blacks have an ever-evolving group of more than 30 individuals who need to stay focused and committed. No-one can be satisfied, no-one can rest on a very plump bed of laurels. Foster has been eight years a selector and part of the backroom staff as Steve Hansen's assistant. When Hansen steps down at the end of this tournament, Foster is tipped as his successor - and a shoo-in if the All Blacks make it three on the spin.\n\nFoster came into the fold a year after the 2011 World Cup, so this would be his second title victory and an unmatched job application. The key requirement for whoever steps into Hansen's shoes, though, will be maintaining the hunger.\n\nBut managing the pressure that comes with the black shirt is equally demanding, according to Foster.\n\n'One of the great challenges of sport is how you keep growing a group that's performing well,' he said. 'That's part of the All Blacks story and we feel the pressure to keep writing it.\n\n'There are always strong expectations. We know about those expectations every time we play, the pressure on us, and it's a matter of getting used to how you deal with it. We don't always get it right but we enjoy these occasions.\n\n'This type of match is what gets us excited. So we know we're going into a game against a great team but you can't let that inhibit you or close you down. That's what we try to do, work against that.\n\nNew Zealand assistant coach Ian Foster (left) could take over from Steve Hansen (right)\n\nMaro Itoje spoke of the impressive nature of New Zealand's ability to vary their style of play\n\n'From selection onwards we go very hard on identifying players who are right for the job. We make sure we get as much information on players as we can and then the next part of is growing them once they are in our environment.\n\n'So it's two-fold. Picking the right quality of player, yes, but also ones who will thrive on that pressure rather than suffocate.'\n\nEntire books have been dedicated to the philosophy of the modern All Blacks, creating an air of mystique. Some of this is mythologised, of course. All Blacks err ethically, All Blacks lose matches occasionally too. But none in a World Cup since the 2007 quarter-final with France.\n\nThere are experienced, senior England players who have lived their entire professional lives with the All Blacks at the top of the sport. Owen Farrell, the captain, is one.\n\n'I've just got a massive amount of respect for them,' he said.\n\n'As with anyone who is at the top for that long, it doesn't come about by doing the same thing, over and over. You have to reinvent yourself and you have to figure out ways of staying ahead of the curve and in terms of that I think we all have a lot of respect for what they have done.'\n\nThe variety in New Zealand's play also made an impression on Itoje. 'The reality is New Zealand can play tight, they can play wide, they can play set-piece if they want to,' he said.\n\n'Playing against the All Blacks you have to anticipate everything,' echoed Elliot Daly. 'They have some quality players who will think differently to other teams and it is about anticipating on the run and making sure you are always in the game.'\n\nSo where do they stand, these All Blacks? The most frequent comparison is to the Brazilian football team, and perhaps that is true in terms of capturing imaginations.\n\nJones has been making mischief all week but he is not wrong when he says that now their own team is out, the locals have switched allegiance just as wholeheartedly to the All Blacks.\n\nThey play the best rugby, the black look is slick and chic and they have the appealing ritual of the haka. To the Japanese, they stand out, the way Brazil do in their yellow shirts and with their naturally exuberant style of play.\n\nYet Brazil have never won the World Cup three times consecutively and last retained it in 1962. New Zealand are probably nearer the dominant Australian cricket team - World Cup winners in 1999, 2003 and 2007.\n\nNew Zealand are reaching the pinnacle of sporting success and are similar to Brazil of 1962\n\nYet Test matches are the pinnacle of cricket, not the one-day game, and in that period Australia gave up three Test series to India, and the Ashes to England. What New Zealand are setting out to do in Japan is arguably unprecedented.\n\nThere was plenty of fighting talk on Friday, of ding-dongs, of climbing into each other - for all their beauty the All Blacks have never been scared of a physical confrontation, or of the wet and windy conditions that beset the region on Friday.\n\nWellington, where the All Blacks play some of their rugby, has never been mistaken for a fortnight in the Bahamas once the winter sets in.\n\nEqually, there is an interesting statistic floating around about New Zealand scrums at this World Cup. They haven't lost one, not on their own put-in. And while that isn't as remarkable as it would have been two decades ago, when scrums were better marshalled, it still says much for a pack that has scrummed against South Africa and Ireland so far.\n\nPerhaps that is what encapsulates New Zealand. Ball in hand or set-piece, wet or fine, and for all the pressure that chases them wherever they go, however you want to play it, they can play it.\n\nThis is England's biggest test since the 2003 final. If they want a game, they've got a game; if they want a war, they've probably got that, too.\n\nIt isn't just mystique that places the All Blacks at the summit. It's having a team of Tigers.", "description": "MARTIN SAMUEL - CHIEF SPORT WRITER IN YOKOHAMA: New Zealand are chasing their third straight World Cup triumph which will put them up there with sports' greatest ever teams.", "authors": ["Martin Samuel - Sport For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20195172-0-image-a-11_1572035234915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
