Photo: Stefani Reynolds/Getty Images\n\nIn the Trump era, Lindsey Graham has revealed that some of his political opinions are a tad opportunistic. Four years ago, the South Carolina senator told CNN, \u201cYou know how to make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell.\u201d Today, he obsequiously praises the president \u2014 and the president\u2019s golf courses \u2014 on a near-constant basis. In 1999, Graham insisted that a president \u201cdoesn\u2019t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic.\u201d Today, Graham argues that it was so unjustifiable for Nancy Pelosi to launch an impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump \u2014 merely because the president is openly trying to coerce foreign governments into investigating his top rivals in the 2020 election \u2014 that the probe is best described as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, as of this morning, Graham did appear to have some genuine ideological commitments. The neoconservative senator has been an unwavering advocate for any and all American military interventions abroad, and a hawkish critic of Iran\u2019s Islamist regime. And when fealty to Trump and adherence to neoconservative orthodoxy have come into conflict, Graham has generally prioritized the latter. After the president gave Turkish president Recep Erdogan the green light to invade Kurdish-controlled northeastern Syria this week, Graham tweeted, \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nBut a newly released prank call suggests that even Graham\u2019s foreign-policy principles may be up for negotiation. Back in August, the infamous Russian pranksters (and/or Russian intelligence operatives) Alexey Stolyarov and Vladimir Kuznetsov gave Graham\u2019s office a ring. Stolyarov claimed to be the Turkish minister of defense, and Graham took him at his word. Over the ensuing conversation, the South Carolina senator expressed sympathy with Turkey\u2019s Kurdish problem, and affirmed that America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria did pose a \u201cthreat\u201d to Erdogan\u2019s government. As Politico reports:\n\n\u201cYour YPG Kurdish problem is a big problem,\u201d Graham told the pranksters. He was referring to the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, a group that began fighting ISIS as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces in 2015 \u2014 with support from the U.S. \u2014 but is considered a terrorist group by Turkey because of its push to establish an autonomous state for the Kurds on the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\n\u201cI told President Trump that Obama made a huge mistake in relying on the YPG Kurds,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cEverything I worried about has come true, and now we have to make sure Turkey is protected from this threat in Syria. I\u2019m sympathetic to the YPG problem, and so is the president, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, public words on this matter count for more than private ones to a Turkish official. And it is possible for Graham to be sympathetic to Erdogan\u2019s concerns while still opposing the Turkish president\u2019s invasion. Nevertheless, the call suggests that Graham\u2019s views on the Kurds may be highly dependent on what he believes a given audience wishes to hear.\n\nAnother suspect excerpt from the call concerns the newly infamous case of Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab. Zarrab was arrested in 2016, on allegations that he had used his network of companies to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. Last year, Zarrab pleaded guilty and testified against Mehmet Hakan Atilla, the leader of the Turkish state-owned Halkbank. Atilla was later convicted of helping Iran evade sanctions. Zarrab also testified that Erdogan had known of the money-laundering operation and supported it. Before the plea, Erdogan had fought for Zarrab\u2019s release through diplomatic channels, ostensibly because he wished to avoid the airing of such allegations against himself.\n\nGiven the Trump administration\u2019s fiercely anti-Iran foreign policy \u2014 and the president\u2019s frequent laments about Barack Obama\u2019s criminal failure to starve Tehran of funds \u2014 you might think that this White House would have no interest in making Zarrab\u2019s life easier. But you would be wrong (because Zarrab hired Rudy Giuliani as his lawyer).\n\nOn Wednesday night, Bloomberg revealed that in 2017 Trump had asked former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to tell the DOJ to get off Zarrab\u2019s back. Tillerson refused on the grounds that Trump\u2019s request constituted obstruction of justice.\n\nIn his phone call with the pranksters in August, Graham assured the fake Turkish defense minister that his party\u2019s leader was doing everything in his power to help a man who had subverted U.S. sanctions against Iran escape justice (I personally regard those sanctions themselves as unjust, but Graham and Trump ostensibly do not share that view).\n\n\u201cAnd this case involving the Turkish bank, he\u2019s very sensitive to that,\u201d Graham said, referring to the Zarrab case, according to Politico. \u201cThe president wants to be helpful, within the limits of his power.\u201d\n\nAgain, it is possible that Graham was just being diplomatic here. But given how flexible his views have proven on other matters, it seems fair to suspect that the South Carolina senator could refashion himself as an apologist for Kurd-killers and Iranian money-launderers, as long as the price was right.", "description": "In a prank phone call this August, Lindsey Graham told a fake Turkish defense official that he sympathized with Erdogan\u2019s \u201cKurdish problem\u201d and that the Syrian Kurds posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to Turkey.
