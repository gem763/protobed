But it could be on top of your neighbors\u2019 home, not parked in their driveway.\n\nTesla Inc. TSLA, +9.49% Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday unveiled the electric-car company\u2019s new solar-paneled roofs and said he expects to be fitting more than 1,000 a week within short order.\n\nTypical pricing: Around $35,000, the company said.\n\nIt\u2019s another bold promise from the controversial technology entrepreneur, whose company stunned skeptics on Wall Street last week by breaking into profit in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI think within the next several months we should be well past 1,000 roofs a week,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal.\u201d Sales, he said, \u201cwill grow like kelp on steroids. Long term, obviously we want to do 10,000 roofs a week. \u201c\n\nAbout 5 million new roofs are installed a year in America, Tesla said. Musk believes that in the future effectively all roofs will generate solar power. \u201cThe addressable market is 100 million roofs,\u201d he said.\n\nTesla\u2019s new solar roofs are not to be confused with the company\u2019s standard solar paneling, which can be added to an existing roof and competes with multiple similar products. Tesla\u2019s solar roofs are an entire new roof for your home, an integrated power-generating structure. They are more expensive than panels, though Tesla argues they are cheaper than the combined cost of panels and a new roof. The current version is the third iteration.\n\nTesla is working on aesthetics. Colors coming soon will include earth tones, clay tile and French slate as well as the current black, it said.\n\nThe economics of solar panels \u2014 not to mention roofs \u2014 are getting better and better for homeowners. Panels are getting cheaper and better. Meanwhile, the chances are the price of electricity from your local power company has either stayed steady or gone up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a no-brainer,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019s really: Do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn\u2019t print money, we\u2019ll fix it or take it back.\u201d\n\nMusk said the economics are better if you buy than finance. \u201cMost people do actually buy it, as opposed to rent it, which actually is technically better,\u201d he told investors last week. \u201cWhile you make money immediately if you rent it, it\u2019s actually a better investment if you buy it.\u201d\n\nFinancial advisers say consumers need to do their homework before taking the plunge on solar panels from any source. Multiple factors to take into account, they say, include not just any upfront costs, but also service agreements and warranties, financing costs, tax breaks and possible income from the power company if you produce more electricity than you use. Homeowners should run the numbers on buying the panels or renting them. And, naturally, some homes are better for it than others. Those with big roofs that face south are best.\n\nSome advisers admit that the first time they\u2019ve really run the numbers on solar paneling has been when they\u2019ve done it on their own home. But that\u2019s now giving them more confidence to talk numbers with the clients.\n\nKatherine Fibiger, an adviser at Stratos Wealth Partners in Westport, Conn., recently installed paneling \u2014 not from Tesla \u2014 on her own home, taking advantage of today\u2019s cheap interest rates to finance the panels for 12 years at less than 1% annual interest. \u201cIt was positive cash-flow from day one,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we weren\u2019t out of pocket.\u201d\n\nBut if you are going to buy panels, don\u2019t just look at price, she warned. \u201cIt\u2019s an expensive system, and it\u2019s an expensive system to maintain, and it\u2019s on your roof,\u201d she said. Check the warranties, service agreements and the stability of the company, she said. \u201cA key issue was the type of warranty that\u2019s offered. If we have any issue with the roof, and the panels have to come off, they\u2019ll do that for free.\u201d\n\nSolar panels, and now entire solar roofs, are long-term products that are typically expected to last for 20 or 30 years. So you want to have confidence that the company supplying them is going to last as well, advisers say. Your warranty may not be much use if the company that produced it has gone out of business, they note.\n\nFor that reason, last week\u2019s pickup in Tesla\u2019s fortunes may have come at an opportune time for its solar business. A few months ago, the markets were worrying about Tesla\u2019s financial condition. It\u2019s not just the stock that has rallied since. The company\u2019s bonds, or IOUs, jumped sharply last week. The 2025 bonds now trade at 95 cents on the dollar, up from just 82 cents a few months ago.\n\nIn the eyes of Wall Street, the risks that the company might run out of money and default haven\u2019t vanished completely \u2014 but they have certainly faded sharply.", "description": "Tesla Inc.
