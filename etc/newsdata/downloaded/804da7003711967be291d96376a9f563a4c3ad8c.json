Starting today in the US, the Insecure creator\u2019s voice will be available to make a cameo through the Google Assistant app on iOS and Android, as well as on Google Home speakers and various smart displays, like Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max, and Lenovo Smart Display. Rae\u2019s voice is available for a limited time.\n\nTo switch from your current Google Assistant voice to Issa\u2019s, you can do so by saying \u201cHey Google, talk like Issa,\u201d or by switching the settings within the mobile app. Just as for the voice of John Legend, the only other celeb whose voice is available for Google Assistant, there are specific queries that will trigger a unique response from Rae.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of sample commands, straight from Google:\n\n\u201cDo I need an umbrella today?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me a secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a quote from Issa Rae.\u201d\n\n\u201cSing a song.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me a joke.\u201d\n\nOr ask, \u201cMirror talk\u201d or \u201cHow do I look?\u201d for confidence-boosting affirmations.\n\nThere are a few other special responses Issa recorded, and Google says you can ask \u201cHey Google, do you love Daniel or Lawrence more?\u201d or \u201cHey Google, tell me something awkward.\u201d But beyond a few easter eggs, everything else will be handled by your standard Google Assistant voice of choice.\n\nThis approach differs from how Google implemented Legend\u2019s voice. Much of Legend\u2019s likeness wasn\u2019t recorded; it\u2019s simulated through WaveNet, Google\u2019s DeepMind voice synthesis tech. Instead of going through the effort of recording responses to all sorts of requests, then having to sort through them all to find the match for your specific query, the AI does all the hard work in real time. It applies Legend\u2019s voice model in a natural way to give responses that weren\u2019t recorded in the studio, and as a result, the singer\u2019s voice can be heard answering all sorts of questions.\n\nHaving Issa\u2019s voice as an option is great, but the rollout of celebrity voices on Google Assistant has transpired slower than I thought it would. Amazon recently announced it will soon offer Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s voice as a replacement for the standard Alexa voice. It\u2019s promising a clean or explicit voice option for the actor, and it will be available for 99 cents starting later this year. So in other words, the race is officially on for Google to add more celebrity voices to its own smart assistant.", "description": "The voice of actor and writer Issa Rae is now available for Google Assistant.
