I am not a natural fashionista.\n\n\"Following the style of the Duchess of Cambridge has immensely improved my wardrobe.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / @ladyrowenaofivanh)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"It's like having a personal stylist on a royal level. Kate Middleton presents as incredibly natural and genuine.\n\n\"There is nothing over the top or overly done about her- even when she's royally dressed.\"\n\nRowena regularly trawls eBay, Poshmark and Amazon for fashion pieces - spending an average of up to $600 (around \u00a3500) a month on items.\n\nShe added: \"Usually I go to eBay or Amazon, but when I really want the item I go directly to the brand or retail. I keep about 20 items on my watch list on eBay.\n\n\"I have about 25 'real-Kates'. The rest of my closet is a 'repli-Kate,' about 50 clothing pieces.\n\n\"Then there's jewellery, I have real-Kates and repli-Kates. From the engagement ring to the actual Kate Spade red earrings.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / @ladyrowenaofivanh)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I also have the Tiffany pieces. I get my pearl and stone repli-Kates from Asia which are much cheaper than the real stuff.\"\n\nRowena learnt how to trade stocks and shares online and this is how she funds her hobby.\n\nIt's not just royal clothing that Rowena is interested in as she also uses skin care brands used by the Duchess and her favourite haircare brand, Kerastase.\n\nRowena shares her repli-Kate hobby on Instagram under the handle, @ladyrowenaofivanhoe.\n\nShe added: \"I learnt to trade stocks these last couple of years- and did well.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / @ladyrowenaofivanh)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"While my husband is incredibly supportive, I fund my own hobby through my earnings from day trading. My current 'work' or personal source for spending money is from trading stocks.\n\n\"Reasons why her style resonates with me are; we love the country life, even in home design, and the outdoors, curry is the only dish I can cook and it is also supposedly her favourite homecooked dish, we appreciate a little spice.\n\n\"We are fans of Downton Abbey, traditional and classy. We wake up early for the school routine and drop off. When on mummy duty dressing should be efficient.\n\n\"We like the fitness lifestyle and fitness wear, we keep moving.\"\n\nFor more information see www.instagram.com/ladyrowenaofivanhoe", "description": "'Repli-Kate' Rowena Penaranda de Obieta loves emulating the Duchess's flawless look and thinks the pair have a lot in common as they're both busy mums", "authors": ["Rebecca Drew", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Ladyrowenaofivanh", "Rex", "Pa", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20426575.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kate-Middleton-Fashion-Fan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
