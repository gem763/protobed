Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if Covanta Holding is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. It sure looks interesting on these metrics - but there's always more to the story . Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Covanta Holding!\n\nNYSE:CVA Historical Dividend Yield, October 28th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 1868% of Covanta Holding's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.\n\nWe also measure dividends paid against a company's levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. With a cash payout ratio of 400%, Covanta Holding's dividend payments are poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Covanta Holding's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would definitely be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nIs Covanta Holding's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Covanta Holding's dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Covanta Holding has net debt of 8.20 times its EBITDA, which implies meaningful risk if interest rates rise of earnings decline.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of less than 1 times its interest expense, Covanta Holding's financial situation is potentially quite concerning. Readers should investigate whether it might be at risk of breaching the minimum requirements on its loans. Low interest cover and high debt can create problems right when the investor least needs them, and we're reluctant to rely on the dividend of companies with these traits.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Covanta Holding Corporation (NYSE:CVA) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
