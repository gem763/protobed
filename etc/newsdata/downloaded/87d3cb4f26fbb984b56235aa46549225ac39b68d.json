Showers hanging off of the walls.\"\n\nShe added: \"We then discovered in a low kitchen cupboard that there was an axe placed that was accessible to everyone including our children, we couldn't believe our eyes.\"\n\nAfter complaining, the family were relocated to another villa.\n\nBut they claim this only happened because of the help of an \"external rep\" and not Jet2 holidays.\n\n(Image: Laura Broughton/Facebook)\n\n(Image: Laura Broughton/Facebook)\n\n\"Unhappy is an understatement,\" she wrote. \"[If] it was not for Carole, we would have been stuck in a dangerous villa with a potential fatality as you can clearly see from the pictures attached!\"\n\nOn its website, Jet2 Villas describe the accommodation as \"bright and airy\" with \"immaculately kept gardens.\"\n\nFellow social media users reacted with concern to her post.\n\nEarlier this year two holidaymakers died at a Jet2 hotel in Bulgaria after contracting Legionnaires' disease.\n\nJohn Cowan from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire and Brian Taylor from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, both died in June after contracting the fatal disease, which is caused by inhaling contaminated water droplets.\n\nFollowing their deaths, customers were evacuated from the hotel by Jet2 as a precautionary measure.\n\nA Jet2 spokeswoman said: \u201cWe apologise to the Broughton family for any inconvenience caused. Customer service is of the upmost importance to us and they have been moved to a different villa.\n\n'We hope they enjoy the rest of their holiday.\u201d", "description": "Laura Broughton says her seven year old daughter found the knife at the property in Turkey", "authors": ["Bethan Sexton", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Laura Broughton Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20688238.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Dangerous_jet2_villa_DN11JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
