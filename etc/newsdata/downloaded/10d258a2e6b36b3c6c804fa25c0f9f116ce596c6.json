The portfolio manager of the $22 billion Invesco Oppenheimer Discovery Mid Cap Growth Fund also owns companies like CoStar Group (up 76% year-to-date) and Synopsys (up 62%).\n\nThese aren't major household brands because Zibelli's focus is on the small- and mid-cap universe, where the risks are greater but the payoffs can also be huge.\n\nAll told, his fund has gained 30% over the past year, placing it in the 93rd percentile among its peer group according to Bloomberg data.\n\n\n\nHis success does not only stem from sheer luck. During a recent interview with Business Insider, Zibelli discussed how he finds \"premier growth\" stocks by hunting for companies with industry dominance, sustainable competitive advantages, and time-tested leaders.\n\nRead more: A fund manager who's averaged a 16% annual return since the financial crisis shares his 'secret weapon' \u2014 and unpacks 3 stocks driving his success\n\nHe also shared one book that has helped his process: \"The Fourth Industrial Revolution.\" The book was published in 2017 and written by Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum.\n\nIt is widely believed that humanity has lived through three industrial revolutions.\n\nFirst came the advent of steam power in the 18th century.\n\nSecondly, mass production enabled the industries that brought us electricity, steel, and other technologies that defined the 19th century.\n\nThirdly, the invention of the semiconductor, personal computing, and the internet all changed the world in the 20th century.\n\nAnd now, Schwab believes we're going through a fourth industrial revolution. Here's how he described it in a blog post:\n\n\"The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.\"\n\nHe further told Business Insider's Sara Silverstein in an interview earlier this year that these technologies will fundamentally change business models, economies, societies, politics, and so on.\n\nHow Schwab's thesis helps investors\n\nSo what did Zibelli learn from Schwab's thesis on the fourth industrial revolution?\n\nHe said the book helped him understand how these technologies are quickly sweeping the globe, and \"how extremely important it is to understand what's going on with disruptive innovation and technological advancement to be able to succeed in the investment arena.\"\n\nIf the hype about the fourth industrial revolution is true, then technologies like AI could be game changers like the ones that preceded it.\n\nFor context, skyscrapers and the rail industry would probably not exist without steel, while the world's most valuable companies today \u2014 which are mostly software-related \u2014 would not have blossomed without the internet.\n\nZibelli hopes to identify stocks at the forefront of the next industrial revolution \u2014 first by understanding what this revolution is all about from the man who tied it all together.\n\n\"We are of the mind that there's a small number of companies that will generate disproportionate returns for investors \u2014 and we're all about finding those,\" Zibelli said.", "description": "Zibelli exclusively shared the book that has helped him understand the biggest technological changes and identify the stocks leading them.", "authors": ["Akin Oyedele"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4d2a04af90923d033e9af?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
