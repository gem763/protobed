He's just not quite ready for this game, but he's close.\n\n\"Jonathan is also close. He'll be in full training (on Thursday). He's not quite ready for this game. A muscle in his leg has needed some load management.\n\n\"But great credit to Joe Marchant. The weeks he has trained with us he's been absolutely outstanding. His attitude has been first class and he has improved every training session.\n\n\"It's been a great opportunity for us. We've talked all along about having that four-game plan and being able to adapt.\n\n\"Clearly there has been some need for adaptation, but this is a great opportunity because we've been able to use different combinations again.\"\n\nJoseph\u2019s teammate Ruaridh McConnochie has been named in the starting line-up for what could be his debut for the third time, having twice been forced to pull out of the team through injury.\n\nMcConnochie joins Jonny May and Anthony Watson in the back three, with the latter given his first outing at full-back since returning from serious injury last month. Piers Francis returns to the side to join Marchant in the centre, having been left out of the 57-15 victory over Ireland two weekend\u2019s ago.\n\nBen Youngs and Owen Farrell continue as the half-back pairing with the latter captaining the side, while in the pack Billy Vunipola starts his fourth consecutive match, with Jones determined to give the No 8 as many minutes as possible despite the risk of injury to one of England\u2019s key players. Vunipola is joined in the back-row by Tom Curry, who again is deployed at blindside flanker, and Mark Wilson, with the on-loan Sale Sharks flanker making his first start of the warm-up campaign.\n\nJoe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes are reunited in the second-row for the first time since the opening-weekend victory over Wales, while Joe Marler, Jamie George and Dan Cole make up the front-row.\n\nEwels and Kvesic are joined among the replacements by Ellis Genge, Luke Cowa-Dickie and Kyle Sinckler, meaning that Saracens hooker Jack Singleton will not play a minute of rugby in his natural position, having only come on the field against Wales to play as emergency cover in the back-row.\n\nWilli Heinz covers scrum-half, with George Ford and Joe Cokanasiga completing the match-day squad.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to be playing against Italy, one of our traditional Six Nations rivals and the game for us is another important step to develop our game fitness and game strategy,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe have gone with a mix and match selection policy to develop our adaptability and the team\u2019s ability to cope with any situation.\n\n\u201cWe have had a solid training week in Treviso with hot conditions so we are looking forward to testing ourselves against Italy on Friday night. Then we hop on the plane and are ready to go to Japan.\u201d\n\nJones added: \u201cWe are excited to be playing in Newcastle. We are playing at an iconic football ground and we know the area is an important one for rugby in the northern part of England. We are looking forward to seeing and playing in front of the fans.\u201d\n\nEngland team vs Italy\n\nAnthony Watson; Ruaridh McConnochie, Joe Marchant, Piers Francis, Jonny May\u2019 Owen Farrell, Ben Youngs; Joe Marler, Jamie George, Dan Cole; Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes; Tom Curry, Mark Wilson, Billy Vunipola.\n\nReplacements: Luke Cowan-Dickie, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Charlie Ewels, Matt Kvesic, Willi Heinz, George Ford, Joe Cokanasiga.", "description": "Eddie Jones has named Joe Marchant to start at outside centre for England\u2019s final Rugby World Cup warm-up match against Italy\u00a0on Friday, despite the Harlequins back not featuring in his 31-man squad for Japan.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/07/joe-marchant.jpg"}
