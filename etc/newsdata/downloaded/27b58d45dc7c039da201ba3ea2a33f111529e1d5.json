Madin Lab/Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology/University of Hawaii via The New York Times)\n\nThe ocean off the Pacific Coast is simmering, threatening coral reefs and livelihoods around Hawaii and causing many to worry of worse to come.\n\n\u201cThe ocean is very important to us,\u201d said Ka\u2019imi Kaupiko, who lives in Milolii, a community often called the last Hawaiian fishing village, on the Big Island. The way of life there depends on the fish provided by the reefs, reefs which are now becoming sick in the warming waters.\n\n\u201cIt affects a lot of how we are going to survive,\u201d Kaupiko said.\n\nResearchers said the heat wave was reminiscent of 2014, when a hot spot that became known as the blob began forming in the Pacific. It expanded and lingered over much of the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Alaska for years.\n\nAt First, Healthy Coral\n\nBoth marine heat waves are \u201csuper unusual,\u201d according to Andrew Leising, a research oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Nearly every other marine heat wave NOAA has recorded in 40 years of satellite monitoring shrinks in comparison.\n\n\u201cThe event in \u201914-15 was maybe eight to 10 times the size of Alaska. And the current event we\u2019re having is nearly that big,\u201d Leising said. \u201cAnd then, everything else is sort of an even further distant third or fourth.\u201d\n\nResearchers say they think that climate change strongly influenced the original blob\u2019s creation.\n\nThe blob also led to the first known mass bleaching event in Hawaii, in which coral reefs stressed by the extreme temperatures shed the symbiotic plant that both gives them their flamboyant coloration and provides them with oxygen.\n\n\u201cParts of Hawaii saw about 50% coral loss for the 2015 event,\u201d Jamison Gove, a research oceanographer with NOAA, said by email. \u201cIt was particularly devastating in areas off Hawaii Island and Maui.\u201d Reef watchers said they were worried about a repeat.\n\nAfter Bleaching, a Dire Outlook\n\nLast time, researchers were unprepared for the marine heat wave, said Greg Asner, director of the Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science at Arizona State University, who is based in Hawaii part of the year.\n\nThis time, in addition to satellite observation and a network of sensors they deployed in July, researchers are using a community science project in which members of the public use a web platform to document any bleached coral that they see. It helps guide researchers\u2019 decisions about where to survey, given how sprawling the Hawaiian Islands are.\n\nGreen on the platform\u2019s maps means no bleaching, yellow and orange mean some bleaching, and red means a lot of bleaching. \u201cAnd if you asked me if you looked at that a month ago, it was just a few yellow dots,\u201d Asner said. \u201cAnd then the orange dots started popping up. And now we have red dots.\u201d\n\nThen, the Algae\n\nEntire fisheries collapsed along the Pacific during the previous heat wave as high water temperatures upended the aquatic food web. According to some estimates, 100 million cod disappeared off the coast of southern Alaska.\n\nWarming waters can trigger the release of a neurotoxin called domoic acid from algae. Shellfish eat the algae, and when animals eat the shellfish they get sick and can die. Tens of thousands of dead seabirds washed up on beaches during the blob, as did sick and dying sea lions, most likely a result of domoic acid poisoning. In 2016, domoic acid also prompted officials to close the California Dungeness crab fishery.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "The ocean off the Pacific Coast is simmering, threatening coral reefs and livelihoods around Hawaii and causing many to worry of worse to come.\"The ocean is very important to us,\" said Ka'imi Kaupiko, who lives in Milolii, a community often called the last Hawaiian fishing village, on the", "authors": ["Kendra Pierre-Louis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4EwZ1zDYJyP4P97V_ue6_A--~B/aD0xMjk4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/bfb1a9e1815b537e3376392243030f75", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
