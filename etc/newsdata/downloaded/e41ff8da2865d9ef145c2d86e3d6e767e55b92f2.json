Fact he was England's best player on the night says it all. 7\n\nKieran Trippier - Back in favour at international level, the Atletico Madrid man was more steady than dynamic. 6\n\nMichael Keane - More combative than assured in the heart of England's defence. Looked rattled on an uneasy night. 5.5\n\nAt times in the clash Everton defender Michael Keane looked rattled by England's opposition\n\nHarry Maguire - His ball retention was as good as anyone on the pitch, but didn't look completely at ease. 6\n\nDanny Rose - Didn't look comfortable in the opening 45 minutes and it didn't get much better in the second. Booked. 5.5\n\nJordan Henderson - Didn't show his usual control in the engine room as England's midfield was overrun. Booked. 6\n\nDeclan Rice - Started sloppily and took a while to find his rhythm. His inexperience at this level showed. 5.5\n\nDeclan Rice's inexperience at this level showed with a generally sloppy performance in Prague\n\nRaheem Sterling - An immediate impact playing a key role in England's early penalty but struggled to find his usual fluency. Booked. 6.5\n\nMason Mount - Wearing No 11 but played at No 10 on his full debut, however the advanced midfield role didn't suit the youngster. 6\n\nJadon Sancho - The Czechs coped with his threat well, limiting the youngster to just a few eye-catching moments. 6\n\nHarry Kane - Scored for England again. Always delivers at this level - but missed two golden second half chances. 6.5\n\nHarry Kane stepped up for the Three Lions, but missed two golden second half chances\n\nSubs: Rashford (Sancho 73); Barkley (Mount 73); Abraham (Rice 88)\n\nSubs not used: Pope, Alexander-Arnold, Henderson, Chilwell, Gomez, Mings, Tomori, Winks.\n\nGareth Southgate - More food for thought for the England boss. Won't have been particularly pleasant viewing. 6\n\nCzech Republic: Vaclik 6.5; Coufal 7, Celustka 7, Brabec 7.5, Bonl 8.5; Soucek 7, Kral 8; Masopust 7.5 (Zmrhal 89), Darida 7, Jankto 6.5 (Kopic 83); Schick 6.5 (Ondrasek 65, 7.5).\n\nSubs not used: Kolar, Pavlenka, Reznik, Kudela, Krejci, Husbauer, Krmencik, Kalvach, Simic.\n\nManager: Jaroslav Silhavy: 7.5\n\nReferee: Damir Skomina (SLO) - A relatively quiet night for the official but did book Sterling for dissent in the second half. 6\n\nAttendance: 18,651\n\nMOTM: Bonl", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL AT THE SINOBO STADIUM: A 100 per cent record for the Three Lions came crashing down in Prague, as Gareth Southgate's side faced a reality comedown.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/21/19607570-0-image-a-15_1570827567104.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
