The light was low. The crowd was murmuring. A song came over the loudspeaker. It was \u201cShut Up and Dance.\u201d On cue, middle-aged men rose from communal tables. With one hand, they held giant plastic cups of beer above their heads. With the other hand, some pointed a single, ecstatic finger toward the ceiling. They began to dance.\n\nThroughout the night, they would rise from their tables to dance again and again. To \u201cSweet Caroline.\u201d To \u201cIce Ice Baby.\u201d To Tina Turner\u2019s \u201cThe Best.\u201d To Pitbull.\n\nAn anthropologist who saw white men dancing so unashamedly would guess that one of two things had happened. Someone turned on a low-numbered SiriusXM channel. Or else the men were watching a niche sport that has conquered British TV and is now moving to colonize the world, including America. The men had come to watch the darts.\n\nDarts, as its Vince McMahon\u2013like impresario Barry Hearn likes to say, is a world-class sport that\u2019s played at a party. As \u201cShut Up and Dance\u201d wafted through the arena, Michael Smith climbed onto the stage. Smith\u2019s face is as round as a dartboard. He has black hair cut into a mohawk. His nickname is \u201cBully Boy.\u201d But as he stood at the foot of the stage, he kissed his hands and received the audience\u2019s applause, like a tenor who was about to burst into song.\n\nSmith\u2019s opponent was a hulking Serb named Mensur Suljovic. Suljovic\u2019s nickname is the \u201cThe Gentle.\u201d But beneath his fixed, ebullient smile, there is a tireless worker. As Suljovic told me, \u201cI never go on holiday \u2026 ever.\u201d\n\nSmith and Suljovic began to play darts. The Gentle aimed at the highest-value part of the board, then threw a 20, another 20, and a treble 20\u2014scoring 100. Pretty good. Bully Boy walked up to the toe line, or oche, and put all three of his darts in treble 20. \u201cOnnnnnne hundred and eighty,\u201d the caller, Russ Bray, growled into a microphone. Bully Boy had gotten the maximum score.\n\nThe funny thing about attending a darts match is that you can hardly see the darts. The dartboard was mounted on a stage at Arena Birmingham. The players stood just under eight feet away. Even fans in the best seats tended to watch the action on video screens. \u201cHow many are here\u20148,000?\u201d said Keith Deller, the 1983 world champion. \u201cMaybe 1,500 might be proper dart fans. The rest are just coming out for a night.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole perception of the sport changes from a pub game, where people in this country especially look down their nose [at it]. Working class people having fun. It\u2019s not really allowed in Britain, you know?\u201d \u2014Barry Hearn\n\nThe fans in attendance weren\u2019t the only fans, of course. Darts\u2014like its American cousin, the World Series of Poker\u2014is a product of the \u201cmagic of telly.\u201d Onstage, Smith and Suljovic were surrounded by 11 Sky Sports cameras, including a jib that rotated above and around them. Two cameramen prowled through the crowd hunting for fans in funny costumes.\n\nOn the live Sky broadcast, viewers had watched Smith and Suljovic walk to the stage on a green carpet, flanked by security, like boxers walking to the ring. In fact, the carpet terminated in the middle of the arena. Smith and Suljovic had walked to the end of the carpet, waited there for their cues, and then made their televised walk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two men throwing from 8 feet at a board, generally at treble 20,\u201d said Rory Hopkins, a longtime Sky Sports producer. \u201cYou do need to have every trick in the book.\u201d\n\nDart players are about the most effortlessly authentic athletes in the world. (\u201cI didn\u2019t feel meself tonight,\u201d one said apologetically, after turning in a poor performance.) But the sport\u2019s journey from the English pub to U.S. television is a story of fierce creation. The imagineering it required is reminiscent of 1980s WWF. Darts is infused with so much animal showmanship that it almost feels American.\n\nHere in the U.K., darts runs on TV on Thursday nights\u2014a night when the Premier League doesn\u2019t play. From that safe harbor, it has flourished. In 2018, the World Darts Championship final was watched by 1.4 million British viewers and another 2.7 million Germans. Last year, BBC America\u2019s Thursday Night Darts netted around 1 million viewers a week on linear TV; in January, the network awarded darts the prestigious post\u2013Doctor Who slot on New Year\u2019s Day. The surest sign that there\u2019s money to be made from darts is that American viewers can find more than a dozen Professional Darts Corporation events (the U.K. Open, Brisbane Darts Masters) in the Sears catalog of sports offered by DAZN.\n\nIt\u2019s probably an overstatement to say darts is Europe\u2019s second-most popular TV sport behind soccer. Which means Barry Hearn says it all the time. Hearn, who is a scenery-chewing 70 years old, is one of Britain\u2019s most fully realized sports promoters\u2014think Dana White with a better tailor. Two weeks ago, I went to visit him at his office, which is located in a Georgian mansion in Essex, east of London. The cabbie who left me at the doorstep said, \u201cCome to see His Majesty, have you?\u201d\n\nHearn sat behind a desk in what used to be living room. Out the door, there was a picture of him with Don King, and a note from Rupert Murdoch, scribbled in the heat of a rights negotiation, which began, \u201cHearn\u2014Get fucked \u2026\u201d Hearn spoke of his favorite topic, which is the overwhelming success of Barry Hearn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a commercial animal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the best in the world at what I do, I think. Well, I know. But I hope other people think.\u201d\n\nHearn has tentacles in TV sports like boxing (his company promotes Anthony Joshua), tenpin bowling, and snooker, which was running on British TV last week. In 1997, Hearn walked into a tavern in the town of Purfleet to watch a darts tournament. Through the cigarette smoke, he could see a mass-participation sport being played by oddly endearing blokes\u2014the raw materials of a hit. \u201cFuck,\u201d Hearn thought. \u201cI can smell the money.\u201d\n\nAccording to historian Patrick \u201cDoctor Darts\u201d Chaplin, the first darts match appeared on the BBC in 1937. But after a TV heyday that stretched into the \u201980s, darts slipped into obscurity. In 2001, Hearn bought the Professional Darts Corporation. With the help of Murdoch\u2019s newly created Sky Sports, he set about refitting the sport for the modern age.\n\nHearn\u2019s up-from-the-pub transformation of darts is similar to the one he underwent himself. (He was quick to point out that he was speaking to me in an unposh, East London accent.) Removed from its working-class trappings\u2014but with its players still radiating working-class chic\u2014darts could become something like England\u2019s NASCAR.\n\n\u201cThe whole perception of the sport changes from a pub game, where people in this country especially look down their nose [at it],\u201d Hearn said. \u201cWorking class people having fun. It\u2019s not really allowed in Britain, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go in your garden at home and go, \u2018C\u2019mon honey, go long!\u2019 and throw a ball and expect her to dive through the hedge and catch it. You can easily go in the kitchen, put a bull up, and have a little chuck.\u201d \u2014John McDonald\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very accessible, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said John McDonald, a stage announcer who is the Michael Buffer of darts. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in your garden at home and go, \u2018C\u2019mon honey, go long!\u2019 and throw a ball and expect her to dive through the hedge and catch it. You can easily go in the kitchen, put a bull up, and have a little chuck.\u201d\n\nThe Professional Darts Corporation could sell out an arena in London every week. But Hearn learned from the WWE that there\u2019s value in tending to fans in Tulsa and Columbus. The event I attended in Birmingham would be followed by stops in Manchester, Sheffield, and Leeds.\n\nIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, darts was dominated by shambling characters like Jocky Wilson, who polished off a half-dozen pre-match vodkas \u201cso that I can play my best.\u201d Today, the men (and a few women) who compete at darts are a more streamlined, professional class. \u201cThey\u2019re just robots,\u201d said Deller. \u201cIt\u2019s all about money now. I bet if you asked the top 20 \u2018Do you love darts?\u2019 about 12 of them might say no. It\u2019s just a job.\u201d\n\nThus, the characters must be amplified, if not created, by TV. The first thing Hearn mandated is that every darts player should have a catchy nickname. \u201cBully Boy\u201d and \u201cThe Gentle\u201d compete with Rob \u201cVoltage\u201d Cross, a former electrician. The Scotsman Peter Wright is \u201cSnakebite.\u201d Daryl Gurney, who has a profile like Jay Leno\u2019s, is \u201cSuperChin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually quite insulting to call someone SuperChin, I think,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cBut he loves it.\u201d Gurney agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not a spice boy,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at a darts player, you see someone who may well live in the street next to you\u2014but they\u2019re good.\u201d \u2014Barry Hearn\n\nLike pro wrestlers, darts player also have walk-on music that\u2019s picked by a committee of sponsors, managers, and league higher-ups. After joining the tour in 2016, Cross walked on to the stage to Electric Six\u2019s \u201cDanger! High Voltage.\u201d After a huddle with the powers that be, Cross now comes out to Arrow\u2019s \u201cHot Hot Hot,\u201d a song everyone can sing along to.\n\nThe hits of the \u201980s, the \u201990s, and today have pulled darts toward a culturally unchallenging, family-friendly atmosphere like the WWE\u2019s Hulkamania era. Beer that flowed freely in darts 40 years ago has been removed not just from the stage but the media room, as well. Darts has cheerleaders, but last year the PDC evicted the \u201cwalk-on girls\u201d that accompanied the competitors to the stage.\n\nPoker\u2019s TV producers marketed Phil Ivey and Johnny Chan as sharks that could relieve a mark of his money. Hearn pitched the PDC\u2019s dartsmen a bit differently. They are proper gents. \u201cWhen you look at a darts player, you see someone who may well live in the street next to you\u2014but they\u2019re good,\u201d Hearn said. Last November, when fans complained that Welshman Gerwyn \u201cThe Iceman\u201d Price was indulging in gonzo celebrations during matches, he was fined a whopping 21,500 pounds.\n\nAs with wrestling and poker, darts\u2019 rough edges have been sanded down so carefully that it\u2019s a shock when the sport\u2019s old rowdiness sneaks back in. Last year, at a tournament in the city of Wolverhampton, someone let out some horrific farts on stage during a match. To the delight of the British press, the players blamed each other. Asked for comment, Hearn deadpanned, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nAs a TV sport, darts has a major problem: Nothing much happens. The \u201caction\u201d is as Martin Amis once described it: \u201csolid thunks followed by shouted numbers against a savage background of taunts and screams.\u201d When Sky Sports producers show an instant replay, they\u2019re more likely to show a player celebrating than throwing a dart. The open-mouthed fist pump is more electric than the actual sport.\n\n\u201cWe create the show in many ways,\u201d said Dave Clark, one of Sky Sports\u2019 hosts. Some of the tricks will be familiar to any American who watches too much ESPN. Sky Sports\u2019 broadcasts begin with computer-generated darts flying through the air, their points emerging tumescently from the barrels.\n\nBefore each match, Sky shows a graphic of the two competitors standing in profile. Then, they turn their heads toward the camera and cross their arms. The shot owes something to the UFC. But with their plain black slacks and regular-guy physiques, darts players look more like two salesmen competing to win this year\u2019s Toyotathon sales event.\n\nSign up for the The Ringer Newsletter Email (required) By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. Subscribe\n\nThe effect of such production values is to convince viewers at home they\u2019re watching a big-time sport. \u201cSometimes that belief can be generated by you just telling them over and over and over again until in the end they believe you,\u201d Hearn said.\n\nThe darts matches I watched moved briskly and clocked in at about a half-hour\u2014a nod to distracted millennials, Hearn said. The game is fairly simple: Each competitor starts a \u201cleg\u201d with 501 points. The first to whittle that number down to exactly zero wins\u2014and the dart that takes them to zero must land in the outer, \u201cdouble\u201d ring or in the bullseye. Sky puts the winning combinations on screen so mathematically-challenged viewers can follow along.\n\nLong ago, the Beeb invented the classic darts shot: a split screen that shows the player and the board. Sky and others have added nifty flourishes. If the competitor throws two treble 20s, as Bully Boy did, Sky will execute a Robert Altman zoom toward the board to see if the player can land the coveted 180.\n\nWatching from the U.S., I found that Sky\u2019s directors had an uncanny ability to anticipate which the part on the dartboard the player would target. In Birmingham, I went to the Sky truck and found Deller, the former world champion, sitting next to Rory Hopkins. Officially, Deller is a \u201cspotter.\u201d But he\u2019s more like the wizard of darts. His job is to figure out which part of the board the players are aiming at and tell the director, so that Sky\u2019s camera shot arrives on your screen a split second before the dart.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d probably get away with anyone else not turning up,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t turn up, we\u2019d be in a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\nDeller had a sheet of paper next to him on which he\u2019d scrawled out Smith and Suljovic\u2019s tendencies, which helped some. Otherwise, Deller relied on the muscle memory of an ex-champion or watched the players\u2019 eyes. When he saw Bully Boy drop his eyes from treble 20 to treble 19, Deller yelled \u201cDown!\u201d and Sky\u2019s director took a shot of the bottom of the board. The comedian Stephen Fry was so mesmerized by Deller\u2019s talent that he once asked to watch him in action.\n\nThe final trick darts producers figured out was how to make those dancing fans into characters on the broadcast. It was the legendary darts announcer Sid Waddell who described a darts show as a combination of Christians being fed to the lions and the Munich beer festival.\n\n\u201cWhen you analyze the viewing habits of darts fans, approximately one-third of their time is spent actually watching the darts,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cTwo-thirds is spent socializing, drinking, gambling.\u201d\n\nHearn added: \u201cAndy Warhol said everybody wants to be famous for 15 minutes. Darts fans want to be famous for two seconds.\u201d\n\nIn the style of wrestling and the NFL, Sky Sports sends its cameras hunting for fans dressed as French fries, as traffic cones, and as Freddie Mercury. (Spotting me with a notepad, \u201cFreddie\u201d demanded I bump knuckles with him.) The promotion distributes blank signs (the sponsor\u2019s name is handily printed at the top) that fans can scribble jokes on when they get to the arena. Sky shows the ones with the funniest quips.\n\nThere\u2019s a deep and knotty psychology to darts that\u2019s only hinted at on the TV broadcast. Backstage, I asked James \u201cThe Machine\u201d Wade what it was like to win a match on television. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like being the unpopular boy at school and you have a slight bit of success in life,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd to lose?\n\n\u201cYou feel like the bullied kid at school again,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the final match in Birmingham (slotted in the viewer-rich, 9 p.m. hour), I pushed away four empty beer cups and took a seat at a communal table near the stage. The competitors were Wade and Dutchman Michael \u201cMighty Mike\u201d van Gerwen. Van Gerwen sits at the top of the Premier League standings, if not the entire sport. But Wade played very well, taking a lead of seven legs to five. (The night\u2019s matches were best of 14.) Van Gerwen had to win the last two legs to force a draw.\n\nIt was a wonderful half-hour watching sports. From a seat in the crowd, the sound was far richer than it is on TV. It meant something when a fan stopped his boozy conversation to turn to the stage. But the way darts has transformed itself for TV is so all-encompassing, so clever, that part of me wished I was watching on telly, or on my phone.\n\nAt his office in Essex, Hearn surveyed the more than 100 countries where darts is now shown on one device or another. \u201cThis world\u2019s changing too fucking fast for an old man like me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d I said politely.\n\n\u201cI doubt that, as well,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it to hear you say it.\u201d\n\nAn earlier version of this piece included an incorrect date.", "description": "The pub game has become the second-biggest televised sport in England.
