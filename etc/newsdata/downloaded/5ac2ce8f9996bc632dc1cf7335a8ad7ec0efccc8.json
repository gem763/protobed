Elizabeth Warren hired a Planned Parenthood lobbyist to a key role in her presidential campaign Tuesday, just one day after Warren announced a plan that would \u201cend lobbying as we know it.\u201d\n\nWarren unveiled an anti-corruption plan Monday that would introduce a \u201ccooling off\u201d period for lobbyists before they can serve in government roles and would prohibit active lobbyists from donating to political campaigns, a practice Warren called \u201clegalized bribery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fundamental promise of our democracy is that every voice matters,\u201d Warren\u2019s plan states. \u201cBut when lobbyists and big corporations can buy influence from politicians, that promise is broken. The first thing to do to fix it is to end lobbying as we know it.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Kimberly Diaz Scott, who registered as a lobbyist for the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates as recently as January 2019, announced that she was leaving the organization to head up Warren\u2019s campaign in Florida.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be far from the movement, as I\u2019m humbled and proud to announce my transition as the Florida State Director for Warren for President, assuring that we will continue to fight like hell to elect a brilliant leader who will work to protect the health, safety and future of ALL people,\u201d Diaz wrote, the Miami Herald reported. \u201c2020 is not for the rich or selfish, 2020 is for us.\u201d\n\nDiaz first registered as a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood in 2015, according to Florida\u2019s Lobbyist Registration Office.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Is she serious?", "authors": ["Andrew Kerr"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/55t4wgDioWmyIrKs5SUAuQ--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/6b21b083689dcf55008e889d883ce43e", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
