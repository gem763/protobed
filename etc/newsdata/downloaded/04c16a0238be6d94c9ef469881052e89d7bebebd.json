He was 71.\n\nThe cause was a heart ailment, said his wife, Linda Langer.\n\nMr. Langer was a first-year starter and played every offensive down for the NFL\u2019s only unbeaten, untied team that went 17-0. The following year he helped the Dolphins repeat as Super Bowl champions, and began a stretch of six consecutive Pro Bowl seasons for Miami while playing in 128 games in a row.\n\nJames John Langer was born in Little Falls, Minn., on May 16, 1948, and grew up in Royalton, Minn.\n\nHe played linebacker at South Dakota State University and went undrafted. He signed with Cleveland as a rookie in 1970 but was cut, joined the Dolphins and made the team as a center in coach Don Shula\u2019s first season with Miami.\n\nMr. Langer was voted the Dolphins\u2019 most valuable player in 1975 and played in the NFL until 1981, spending his final two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings. A four-time All-Pro choice, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1987.\n\n\n\nIn 1973, Miami Dolphins' Jim Kiick (21) follows teammates Jim Langer (62) and Larry Csonka (39) to score against the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl VII in Los Angeles.

His longtime Dolphins roommate, guard Bob Kuechenberg, died in January.\n\nIn 2007, Kuechenberg recalled a conversation he and Mr. Langer had 10 weeks into the 1972 season.\n\n\u201cI told Langer, \u2018Obviously we\u2019re going to have to lose a game.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018I suppose,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201c \u2018When?\u2019 I said.\n\n\u201c \u2018Not this week,\u2019 was the only answer.\u201d", "description": "Mr. Langer was a first-year starter and played every offensive down for the NFL\u2019s only unbeaten, untied team that went 17-0.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/izG5G_8rZODIMr_hD1KQuISDO7c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLFCABWQDQI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
