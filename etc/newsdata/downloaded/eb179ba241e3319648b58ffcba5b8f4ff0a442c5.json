Horne raised his rating to outperform, three months after he upgraded the stock to market perform from underperform. Horne said he was \"making a preemptive move\" to upgrade the stock ahead of results, as he believes KB Home's report will reveal \"decidedly improved housing fundamentals\" and potential upside to current consensus estimates. The FactSet consensus is for KB Home to report earnings per share that declines to 66 cents from 87 cents a year ago and for total revenue to fall 4.4% to $1.17 billion. KB Home's stock has run up 33.3% over the past three months, while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, +1.00% has gained 6.5% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.62% has tacked on 1.6%. Horne also upgraded Lennar Corp. LEN, +0.65% and Toll Brothers Inc. TOL, +1.66% to outperform from market perform. \"Are we chasing the stocks here?\", Horne wrote in a note to clients. \"Yes, we are. Guilty as charged. But we think perhaps better late than never.\"", "description": "Shares KB Home rose 1.0% toward a 20-month high, after Raymond James analyst Buck Horne turned bullish on the home builder, admitting that he's chasing the...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
