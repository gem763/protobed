They were admitted to hospital with injuries to their eyes, due to the stones and glass bottles thrown at them.\n\nBoth officers have since been discharged from hospital.\n\nA third female officer was also slapped by people in the group.\n\n\"It was later discovered that the attack was a result of community members who were venting their frustrations about the land invasion operations that took place in the Mamelodi area the previous week,\" Mahamba said.\n\nHe added that the \"officers had been escorting the service provider to ensure safety and security\".\n\n\"The Tshwane Metro Police Department strongly condemns this behaviour by the community members. Attacks on the police cannot be tolerated, and the department will deal decisively with those who are responsible for this unlawful encounter.\"\n\nMahamba said that the \"absurd interference\" by members of the public prevented officers from giving their best service to the residents of Tshwane and had to be stopped immediately.", "description": "Three Tshwane Metro Police Department officers have been injured after they were attacked in their vehicles by a group of people in Mamelodi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9530/604e2778aa4a4148acd0c700a6ccb9ad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
