What does it say that the conservatives are nicer to me? It\u2019s such a bizarre world,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m such a leftie, I\u2019m a serious leftie, but there\u2019s \u2026 I understand why people on the right \u2014 I didn\u2019t think the left was as mean as the right. They are.\u201d\n\nMs. Williamson has made similar comments in a New Yorker interview about hostility on the left.\n\nMr. Bolling then brought Ms. Williamson on the Wednesday show to explain the hot mic comments, but he seemed to catch the author off guard by playing the clip on the air.\n\n\u201cWell, what I was told was that if I came on your show, you wouldn\u2019t blast it out, and you just blasted it out. So \u2026 I don\u2019t even know where to go with that,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Bolling defended playing the clip, saying it was a matter of journalistic integrity and added he told her campaign they would play it either way.\n\nMs. Williamson said she \u201cwas told differently\u201d but explained her comments.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the rough and tumble of politics and how people behave, I think that there are things that happen just in people, it\u2019s not a left-right issue, and I have found it\u2019s tough out there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was just talking about the fact that that day you were certainly very kind to me. And listen, many people on the left are kind to me. I\u2019m running for president. It\u2019s not a walk in the park. I was making a comment that I found my life that day,\u201d Ms. Williamson continued.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t have to be attacking me right now, I\u2019m in a Democratic primary, so Republicans are, \u2018Hi, Marianne,\u2019 whereas some people on the left, because they\u2019re working for other candidates \u2014 I understand how it goes, that\u2019s all I meant,\u201d she finished.\n\nMs. Williamson is one of 21 candidates attempting to face President Trump in the 2020 election. She did not meet the polling threshold to qualify for Thursday\u2019s debate.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
