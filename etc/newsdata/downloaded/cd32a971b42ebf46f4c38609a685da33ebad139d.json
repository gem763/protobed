While the central bank had previously prioritized price levels, financial stability was introduced as a standard in 2011 after the global financial crisis.The fellow said that the rules could lead to competing interests, adding that had the central bank prioritized price levels over financial stability, it would not have raised the benchmark interest rate in November last year.\u201cAlthough core inflation remained at around 1 percent for months and the economy showed signs of slowing, monetary authorities raised the interest rate to respond to household debt or financial stability,\u201d said Jung, referring to the situation late last year.The bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Board said at the time that an increase was needed considering the rising levels of household debt.Since the November increase, the central bank has cut the benchmark interest rate two times all the way down to a historic low of 1.25 percent. The central bank will make another rate decision next month.Despite its warning, the think tank did not think that the country was already in deflation, explaining that temporary factors, such as a base effect from unusually high food and energy prices last year, contributed to the price fall last month. But concern remains.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t just be wary of deflation but also low inflation,\u201d said Jung, explaining that low inflation could cause a rise in real interest rates and weigh on investment and spending.The fellow added that low inflation caused by supply factors is usually accompanied by high economic growth, explaining that recent sluggish growth indicates that low demand is also responsible for slowing price increases.Jung also pointed out that Korea\u2019s low inflation should not be seen as a sign of global economic downturn, noting that the country\u2019s average monthly inflation rate this year is lower than those in the United States and Britain.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
