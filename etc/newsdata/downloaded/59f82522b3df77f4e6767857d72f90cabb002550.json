There is a lot of s**t that goes down that is dark that they don't want you to see or Channel Nine can't let you see, because it's just not appropriate.'\n\nReality stars must sign strict contracts before appearing on screen, but Martha wants future participants to know they have the option to say 'no'.\n\n'I looked like a s**tty person': Martha said that while her moments on the show weren't scripted, they were selectively chosen. Pictured with fellow 'villain' Jessika Power (right)\n\n'If you want to say no or you don't want to do something, you don't have to do it. I think that is the one thing I wish I knew,' she said.\n\n'If I could give myself advice a year ago it would be, \"If your moral compass is telling you something else, don't do it.\" This person is not going to be the be-all-end-all for you, you can leave, or you can say no to something.\n\n'Just because you think you've signed a contract, you can use your discretion.'\n\n'You can say no to something': Martha said she would encourage future MAFS participants to resist producers if they try to force them into acting in a certain way\n\nLast week, Davina Rankin told Hit 105 that she was considering taking legal action against Nine and producers Endemol Shine Australia after she was portrayed negatively on the 2018 season of Married At First Sight.\n\nDavina, who was described in marketing material as 'TV's biggest villain', said: 'I would [sue] now that I know that you can.'\n\n'To be honest, when it was all going down, I actually had a few friends that are lawyers and I got them to look over my contract and these contracts are so hectic, you're pretty much handing over your life. They own you,' she added.\n\n'It's really had to try and get anything out of it because they've kind of covered their butt in every way.'\n\n'It could open the floodgates': Former MAFS stars, including Davina Rankin and Dean Wells (pictured), are considering legal action against Nine over their 'villainous' edits after Seven's historic payout to House Rules contestant Nicole Prince\n\nThe 28-year-old, who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Jaxon Manuel in the coming weeks, said that it was difficult to overcome the reputational damage she suffered as a result of MAFS.\n\n'I couldn't go to events, I didn't even look at my phone, I didn't leave my house for months,' Davina confessed.\n\nThe former glamour model also claimed she felt an overwhelming sense that people hated her everywhere she went as a result of her portrayal on the show.\n\n'Even people from my series that were not as villianised as much as me are still going through trauma,' she added.\n\nThreats: On Wednesday, Davina (pictured) said that she was considering making a claim against Nine after she was portrayed in a negative light on Married At First Sight last year\n\nDean Wells, who had an 'affair' with Davina on MAFS, also spoke to Nova 96.9 on Wednesday about the House Rules decision and said it could open legal 'floodgates'.\n\n'It totally could, it happens a lot. I spoke out about it and I've had five to six different reality TV people reach out to me and say, \"Yeah, the same thing happened to me\". So it could open the floodgates for sure,' he said.\n\nWhen asked if he was pushed into his 'affair' by producers, Dean said it was completely his decision and took responsibility for his actions.\n\nOrdeal: Davina, who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Jaxon Manuel in a few weeks, said it was difficult to overcome the reputational damage she suffered as a result of MAFS\n\n'What I don't take responsibility for is where they said I want a woman to obey me, when words like that never came out of my mouth. I never said anything like that, they stitched all that together, it was ridiculous,' Dean said.\n\n'Personally, I won't be taking any further action. I do take responsibility. These days I'm fine with it but some people have suffered, especially from the last season of MAFS and my season of MAFS. I know some people are really struggling so I reckon there might be some cases there.'\n\nIt comes after Nicole Prince, who featured on season five of House Rules in 2017 with her friend Fiona Taylor, said she had lost work after being portrayed as a bully on the renovation show.\n\nShe took legal action through the Workers Compensation Commission (WCC), which ruled in her favour and has published its findings in a damning 27-page report.\n\nHated: The former glamour model also claimed she felt an overwhelming sense that people hated her everywhere she went as a result of her portrayal on the show\n\nThe Commission's Arbitrator Cameron Burge ruled that Nicole was an 'employee' of Channel Seven during her time on the show and that, during the course of her employment, she suffered a 'psychological / psychiatric injury'.\n\nSeven has been ordered to compensate Nicole for her medical treatment in relation to the injury. The network is appealing the decision.\n\nThe ruling could set a legal precedent allowing for disgruntled reality stars to take action against broadcasters if they're not happy with their portrayal.\n\nIf you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741-741.\n\nFor confidential support in the UK, call the Samaritans on 116 123 or visit a local branch.
