REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed\n\nThere was standing room only in the expansive halls of Riyadh\u2019s Ritz-Carlton hotel on Tuesday as the world\u2019s financial royalty attended Saudi Arabia\u2019s Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference, aimed at courting global investors.\n\nSaudi Arabia said it signed over two dozen investment deals worth $15 billion, mostly in the manufacturing sector, as the kingdom strives to show that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s diversification plan is on track after limited progress since the first FII forum 2017.\n\nLast year\u2019s event was overshadowed by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi as dozens of Western leaders and executives boycotted the gathering.\n\nOn Tuesday, the bosses of HSBC, Blackstone, BlackRock, Colony Capital and Evercore were among the crowd at the luxury hotel that less than 24 months ago served as one of the detention centers for more than 200 businessmen, ministers and princes during a corruption purge.\n\nThe United States sent a big delegation this year including its energy and treasury secretaries and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner, who is due to speak on Tuesday along with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is also participating in the Oct 29-31 event, as is the head of the World Bank.\n\nPrince Mohammed launched in 2016 a plan to transform the economy of the world\u2019s largest crude exporter and wean it off oil by developing new industries, but outside the entertainment and tourism sectors little progress had been made.\n\nThe $15 billion deals announced on Tuesday included sectors such as manufacturing and technology. Most of the deals announced at last year\u2019s event were clinched by Saudi Aramco.\n\nThe state oil giant remained the biggest draw for investors on Tuesday eager for any news on its long-anticipated listing following attacks on Saudi oil facilities last month that initially halved the kingdom\u2019s output.\n\nROBOTS AND REFORMS\n\nSome foreign investors have been wary of ploughing money into Saudi Arabia due to its human rights record and the commercial viability of some projects, but attendees on Tuesday said the turnout was impressive and reflected reforms to open up the largest Arab economy.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s global banking head, Carlos Hernandez, said the kingdom was on the right path in terms of opening up its capital markets and reforms to make its stock exchange more attractive to foreign investors\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged that they\u2019re doing all the right things on the path to be the major hub in the region,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nReinforcing a technology theme at the conference, SoftBank Corp\u2019s humanoid robot Pepper greeted attendees at the Ritz-Carlton, while Boston Dynamics\u2019 yellow robot dog was also on display plus a 3D interactive booth for Saudi\u2019s planned Red Sea tourism.\n\nSome Saudi women opted not to wear the traditional black abaya covering this year, highlighting social reforms carried out by the crown prince as part of efforts to open up the conservative kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe speed of the change has been phenomenal. We still have a way to go but we have made tremendous improvement. Allowing women to work in any field was tremendous,\u201d said billionaire Saudi businesswomen Lubna Olayan.\n\nARAMCO THE BIG DRAW\n\nSaudi Arabia is pushing to float Aramco this year following another false start last month as the kingdom strives to deliver on a cornerstone of its economic transformation drive, which is the focus of the investment forum.\n\nAramco CEO Amin Nasser was absent from the conference as he was meeting investors abroad to secure the planned initial public offering on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nIt could be the largest listing in history, if the $2 trillion valuation target sought by the crown prince is met.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cThere are several Russian pensions funds who are interested to invest in the Aramco IPO and we have also received indications from our Russia-China fund of some Chinese major institutions also interested in Aramco IPO,\u201d Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nIn addition to the deals announced on Tuesday, which include a $120 million investment deal between Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority and BRF Brazil Foods, other agreements include a memorandum of understanding between Samsung and Saudi entertainment resort Qiddiya.\n\nOne attendee who declined to be named said that while FII drew more participants this year \u201cthe challenge is to see whether people will continue to come going forward, especially once the Aramco deal is out of the way\u201d.", "description": "What a difference a year makes.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446208791&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0IY", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
