Korea\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to 56.7 percent by that year.The government remains committed to its expansionary fiscal policy, considering that the economy this year is expected to grow at the slowest pace since 2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.During an emergency ministry meeting on Tuesday, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki vowed to gain approval for the budget while maintaining much of the original proposal.Hong also ordered officials to pre-emptively prepare for spending next year in order to ensure that the funds could be spent right away.President Moon Jae-in has repeatedly voiced support for the government\u2019s plans, expressing that the expansionary budget is \u201cnot a choice but a necessity\u201d during this year\u2019s annual address to the National Assembly on Tuesday.The National Assembly faces a Jan. 1 deadline to pass the proposal.If it fails to approve the budget by that date, a provisional budget could be set for next year based on this year\u2019s budget, effectively nullifying the expansionary policy direction.Spending for next year focuses on health care, welfare and labor, with 181.6 trillion won proposed for the category, up 12.8 percent from this year.Opposition lawmakers have disapproved in particular of the government\u2019s spending on employment, especially on elderly job programs.The government will create a total of 740,000 jobs for the elderly next year, an increase of 130,000 jobs from this year, spending a total of 1.2 trillion won, up nearly 50 percent from this year.\u201cThe government is injecting funds to create elderly jobs and masking the realities of the employment [situation],\u201d said Liberty Korea Party lawmaker Lee Jang-woo during an audit for the Ministry of Employment and Labor on Monday.Considering that this is the last budget review for the current crop of lawmakers before general elections next year, resistance is expected to be fierce.BY CHAE YUN-HWAN [chae.yunhwan@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
