Saudi Arabia estimates that's about half of the country's oil production \u2014 roughly 5% of the world's daily crude oil output, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhere it stands: The strikes were the largest attacks on \"Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure in more than a decade,\" Bloomberg reports. The energy minister said Saudi Aramco is \"working to recover the lost quantities.\" Saudi Aramco executives held an emergency meeting to determine the damage, per Bloomberg.\n\nThe plant, which burst into flames, is \"crucial to global energy supplies,\" per AP.\n\nThe New York Times notes it's unclear where the drones were launched from, and how the Houthis managed to hit facilities deep in Saudi territory, some 500 miles from Yemeni soil.\n\nOur thought bubble, per Axios' Ben Geman: The attack is likely to push oil prices upward, perhaps significantly so, owing to concern about geopolitical risk \u2014 even if, as the Wall Street Journal reports, production is quickly restored and overall Saudi supplies to global markets aren\u2019t disrupted.\n\nWhat they're saying: President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke on the phone Saturday, with Trump offering \"his support for Saudi Arabia's self-defense,\" according to deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere.\n\nSaudi media reported that the crown prince told Trump, \"The kingdom is willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression.\"\n\nDeere said Trump declared, \"Violent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust.\" The U.S. \"remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied,\" he added.\n\nThe big picture: With tensions heightened between the U.S. and Iran, and across the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Iran \u2014there's a potential \"risk to global oil supply,\" Bloomberg writes.\n\nThe Houthi rebels have been fighting the Saudi-backed central government for years in a war that's led to the one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.\n\nIn January, United Nations investigators wrote that the Houthis had acquired advanced drones that could have a range of up to 930 miles, NYT reports.\n\nSaudi Aramco was reviving preparations for a massive IPO when the attacks happened.\n\nGo deeper: Saudi Aramco replaces chairman as oil giant prepares for massive IPO\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with new details throughout.", "description": "Iran denies the accusation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/NQN6cfUBbN-0Fw7Jm4LAiITgS98=/0x0:1820x1024/1920x1080/2019/09/14/1568471277082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
