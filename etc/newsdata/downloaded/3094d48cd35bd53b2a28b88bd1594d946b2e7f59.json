Kelly gets May 2020 trial date in sex abuse case", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Singer R. Kelly will face a May 18 trial on charges that he recruited underage girls and women to have sex with him, isolating them and controlling what they ate and when they went to the bathroom, a U.S. judge ruled on Wednesday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: R. Kelly walks inside the Criminal Court Building as he arrives for a hearing on eleven new counts of criminal sexual abuse, in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., June 6, 2019. REUTERS/Daniel Acker\n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly set the date for next year\u2019s trial, which had been agreed on by prosecutors and Kelly\u2019s lawyers, at a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nThe 52-year-old R&B singer, known for such hits as \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and \u201cBump N\u2019 Grind,\u201d was arrested in Chicago in July on separate sets of charges brought by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Chicago. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe singer had denied abuse allegations for decades before the latest charges. In 2008, he was tried on child pornography charges and found not guilty.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn say Kelly and his entourage invited women and girls backstage after concerts, kept them from friends and family and made them dependent on him financially.\n\nThe Chicago prosecutors said Kelly had sexual contact with five minors and recorded sexually explicit videos of some of them. They also accused Kelly of obstructing justice by using threats and bribes, including payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars, to keep his victims quiet.\n\nA trial in Chicago has been scheduled for April 27.\n\nThe federal charges were brought after seven women, including his ex-wife, appeared on a Lifetime network television documentary which aired in January and accused him of emotional and sexual abuse.\n\nKelly has been in jail since his July arrest, despite his lawyers\u2019 repeated efforts to have him released on bail. Judges in both Brooklyn and Chicago would need to sign off on his release, and Judge Donnelly on Wednesday refused to do so, saying there was a substantial risk he would flee the country.\n\nIn addition to the two federal cases, Kelly is facing charges from state prosecutors in Illinois and Minnesota. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.", "description": "Singer R.
