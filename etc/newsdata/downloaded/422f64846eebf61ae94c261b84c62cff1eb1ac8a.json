Tech lineman", "url": "https://washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/28/brock-hoffman-hits-ncaa-roadblock", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-28", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:20:19.171497+00:00", "text": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association cares about colleges a whole lot more than it cares about athletes. No debate there.\n\nThe only shock is how often the organization goes above and beyond to prove its true colors.\n\nMaintaining the sham of \u201camateurism\u201d while coaches, conferences and assorted stakeholders rake billions of dollars is the foundation. Preventing players from profiting off their labor or likeness are the walls. Forbidding unfettered movement among players \u2014 opposed to the freedom for job-hopping coaches \u2014 is the ceiling.\n\nWell the NCAA raised the roof and lowered itself even further in ruling against offensive lineman Brock Hoffman, who was seeking immediate eligibility this season after transferring to Virginia Tech last winter.\n\nHoffman, who started for Coastal Carolina the last two seasons, applied for a family medical hardship waiver. He appeared to have a slam-dunk case, wanting to be two hours closer to home to help his mother, still suffering aftereffects from surgery to remove a brain tumor two years ago.\n\nThe application originally was filed in late March and rejected a month later. On Tuesday, after several appeals filed by Virginia Tech and extensive documentation of doctors\u2019 notes and Hoffman\u2019s trips home, the NCAA reached its final decision on the Hokies\u2019 projected starting center playing right away:\n\nNo.\n\n\u201cI really thought after all the information we gave them \u2013 we gave them a book over the summer \u2013 we had this thing,\u201d the player\u2019s father, Brian Hoffman, told The Roanoke Times Tuesday. \u201cIt was like getting stabbed in the back.\u201d\n\nWhen players who haven\u2019t graduated attempt to transfer from one FBS school to another, they\u2019re forced to sit out a year unless they\u2019re granted a waiver. The requirement disincentivizes transfer requests and thereby makes life easier for coaches, who\u2019d otherwise have less year-to-year certainty in building their rosters.\n\nThe NCAA\u2019s decision-making on waiver applications is wildly inconsistent and wholly incoherent.\n\nQuarterbacks Jalen Hurts and Justin Fields are eligible to play right away at Oklahoma and Ohio State, respectively, after each lost the starting job at their prior schools (Alabama and Georgia). Maryland will field a QB, a receiver, a tight end and two linebackers who played elsewhere last season. A slew of other players across the nation will play immediately at new schools for reasons related to depth charts and coaching staffs.\n\nMeanwhile, Illinois tight end Luke Ford has to sit out after transferring from Georgia to be closer to home and his sick grandfather. Ford\u2019s appeal was denied because his new school is more than 100 miles from his family home and grandfathers don\u2019t qualify as nuclear family members.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, the NCAA denied Brock Hoffman\u2019s original application because his family home was 105 miles from Blacksburg \u2013 five miles beyond the acceptable limit \u2013 and the NCAA also deemed that Stephanie Hoffman\u2019s condition was improving. The latter conclusion was partially based on the fact that she still works.\n\nIf she\u2019s in such bad shape, the NCAA asked with unmitigated gall, why hasn\u2019t she retired?\n\n\u201cWe have almost a million dollars of medical bills,\u201d Brian Hoffman told The Roanoke Times. \u201cShe\u2019s a teacher and doesn\u2019t have enough years to get full pay from her pension. We simply couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nBut the story gets worse. The Athletic reports that the ultimate rejection wasn\u2019t due to proximity or Stephanie\u2019s progress; it was a matter of the calendar. Brock Hoffman didn\u2019t transfer quickly enough, not within the academic year after his mother\u2019s diagnosis.\n\n\u201cHere we are, basically the fifth or sixth time we\u2019ve gone back and forth with these folks, and now it\u2019s a no for another different reason,\u201d Brian Hoffman told The Athletic. \u201cIt\u2019s not even the original reason they gave us. So they\u2019re nitpicking this thing to death and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why, either, besides the organization being heartless, soulless and mindless.\n\nCollege football wouldn\u2019t suffer if Hoffman was allowed to play right away. The massive paychecks from broadcasters wouldn\u2019t cease. The sale of tickets, concessions, and merchandise wouldn\u2019t dip. The sponsors and advertisers wouldn\u2019t vanish.\n\nOnly the Hoffmans are hurt by the decision. As if the family hasn\u2019t endured enough since January 2017, when Stephanie had the first of several surgeries for a non-cancerous brain tumor.\n\n\u201cIt should have been an open-and-shut case, honestly,\u201d Brock Hoffman told reporters in April after his initial request was denied. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a punch in the gut.\u201d\n\nBelow the belt is more accurate, but that figures.\n\nLow blows are an NCAA specialty.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
