The op-ed makes an argument that nonpartisan government watchdogs would make, arguing in favor of a law that would prohibit self-dealing by those with government connections.\u201d\n\nLast month, Biden\u2019s campaign called on news networks to stop having Giuliani on the air altogether.", "description": "Biden's campaign sent a critical letter to the paper Wednesday about \"spread of a baseless conspiracy\" about the former vice president", "authors": ["Lindsey Ellefson", "Jeremy Fuster", "Tony Maglio", "Brian Welk"], "top_image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1141189340-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
