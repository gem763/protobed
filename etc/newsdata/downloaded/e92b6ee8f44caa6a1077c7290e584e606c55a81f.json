Talk about putting the boot in. To be honest I haven\u2019t thought about Battlefield at all until it came up this week and that is kind of shocking considering how big it used to be. I don\u2019t really know what went wrong either as I thought Battlefield 1 was fairly well received. Battlefield V obviously wasn\u2019t but I still didn\u2019t think it was that bad.\n\nBut that weird focus on the story mode when it first came out and literally nobody caring about the Battle Royale mode really seems to have killed it. With Call Of Duty as big as ever and Apex Legends doing really well for EA I wonder if they\u2019re just going to put it on the backburner for the next couple of years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019d be good for DICE to do something different (and no, not Star Wars: Battlefront) and I think the only chance for Battlefield now is for people to miss it and want it to come back. I remember when at one point it was poised to overtake Battlefield but we\u2019re obviously miles away from that at the moment. Plus it\u2019s EA and you know they don\u2019t tend to take too many risks. And what they do to developers that don\u2019t bring home the bacon anymore\u2026\n\nThe Colt\n\nThe gen the music died\n\nUntil that reader mentioned Guitar Hero and Rock Band the other day I hadn\u2019t thought of those franchises in what must be years. It\u2019s mad to think that Guitar Hero used to be one of the biggest things around, before Activision milked it to death and the whole plastic instrument fad died out almost overnight.\n\nPretending to play a music instrument with your friends sounds like it should be something that\u2019s always popular but I guess the problem is that they went through all the big name bands and songs too quickly and we kind of\u2026 ran out of songs?\n\nThat combined with rock music being at its lowest ebb since it was invented I think it\u2019s a case of music killed the video game star. I don\u2019t see anyway to bring it back either. Not when the whole appeal was messing around with friends, something the online and microtransactions and all the other modern cons can\u2019t really help with.\n\nDevilmun\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSequel downsides\n\nI actually don\u2019t want The Outer Worlds to have DLC as I\u2019d much rather they got on with the sequel. The Outer Worlds was actually the last game to be started by Obsidian before they were bought by Microsoft. So if there is a sequel then it would be published by them and would presumably have a much bigger budget. Or at least I assume it would. I don\u2019t really see why Microsoft would bother buying a developer like that and just keep them making everything on a shoestring.\n\nThere are a couple of downsides though. The first is that the sequel will probably be Xbox and PC exclusive. I believe Microsoft has said they haven\u2019t decided yet but I\u2019d say it\u2019s most likely. The only thing that might stop it is the fact that I\u2019m not sure the original has done that well.\n\nComing out the same week as Call Of Duty always seemed crazy and I see from the charts that it came in fourth, behind WWE 2K20 and only just ahead of MediEvil. That\u2019s not a great start, but who knows. When it inevitably ends up in the Black Friday sales maybe that\u2019ll get it a wider audience, like what happened with the Doom reboot.\n\nMidnight Son\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nAutomatic support\n\nI\u2019m really not feeling the hype for Star Wars Jedi: The Fallen Order. That reveal at E3 killed any interest I had in it dead, and I think it\u2019s the same for most people. I do feel I should probably support it though, just because it\u2019s a single-player game by EA and they\u2019ll forever quote it\u2019s failure as the reason for not doing more if it\u2019s a flop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept, that logic makes me think of the Fallout 76 guy in the Inbox the other day, who felt compelled to buy a subscription even though he doesn\u2019t even play the game anymore. I don\u2019t like to think I\u2019m that bad but if it\u2019s the thin end of the wedge I don\u2019t want to start down that path.\n\nI think I\u2019ll just hope it reviews well and leave it at that. I\u2019ve actually no idea how it\u2019ll do given the weird way it\u2019s been handled so far.\n\nKleo\n\nSmall screen hero\n\nI\u2019m always amazed just how popular Pok\u00e9mon is. The stuff about people camping outside the London shop just so they can give Nintendo their money and now this trading card going for the price of a flat. It\u2019s crazy. The only thing I don\u2019t understand is that given all that how comes the Pikachu film didn\u2019t do that great?\n\nAs far as I understand it turned a profit and not much else, which seems weird given that Pok\u00e9mon is so popular and the film was really quite good. Maybe people just thought it was going to be bad and stayed away but considering some of the films that do do well that seems unlikely.\n\nIt\u2019ll be crazy if Sonic, which looks horrendous, ends up doing better. Or maybe video game movies are just cursed forever now and no one will ever trust them again. Seems a bit of a shame just as a good one comes out.\n\nBaker\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne too many\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I could not let Rolph\u2019s bizarre statement that the first Luigi\u2019s Mansion was \u2018worthless\u2019. Wait, what? It was no killer app, that\u2019s for sure but it has always been a quintessential 7 out of 10 game. Certainly not a bad way to spend 12 hours when you plug in your new GameCube for the first time way, way back in 2002. I mean, without having played the sequel, as I\u2019ve never owned a 3DS, it surely provides the foundation on which it is based? Therefore, to say the original is worthless is to call the whole concept worthless, no? Is that not logic 101?\n\nYeah, Luigi\u2019s Mansion was way too short and had no post-game content \u2013 but it was still good fun. And anything that\u2019s fun is always worth doing again. The bosses were all of a high standard and the idea of having to perform some sort of task or go on a side-quest to defeat the bigger, named ghosts was clever. And then being able to use elemental attacks later on was quite satisfying.\n\nI have no doubt that the critical consensus is correct in saying that the sequel refined and expanded upon the concept to a large degree, but to then claim that the original is some sort of glorified tech demo is ludicrous in the extreme.\n\nAlso, I never trust people who think \u2018too easy\u2019 is a criticism. Okay, I\u2019ve played games and fought bosses that were a bit of a pushover but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean they weren\u2019t enjoyable. It\u2019s used as lazy shorthand that implies something isn\u2019t worth your time without actually explaining why and it really gets my goat.\n\nDMR\n\nGC: We gave it 6/10. It was always a glorified tech demo.\n\nOuter love\n\nJust had to write in to spread the love for The Outer Worlds.\n\nI\u2019m not very far into the game, I\u2019ve found my first follower and I\u2019m busy with the side missions I\u2019ve come across in the first settlement, but the games quality is already shining through.\n\nI like that you can approach the game how you like, so far I\u2019m playing stealth with persuasion but I might resort to the guns later on. On the whole I\u2019m very impressed and it definitely deserves its GC review score.\n\nBethesda could learn a lot from Obsidian.\n\nMitchell\n\nCatch up on every previous Games Inbox here\n\nPeaceful option\n\nAlthough I did confess as much in my contribution to last weekend\u2019s Hot Topic I was a bit hasty as I didn\u2019t address the question as to whether I go out of my way to avoid being violent if possible. And the answer is yes, yes I do.\n\nPlaying GTA V I tried to avoid running over the exclusively adult pedestrians but wouldn\u2019t be wracked with guilt if it inadvertently happened. On the other hand, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to harvest the little sisters in Bioshock despite the game promising more ADAM if I did. A housemate at the time had no such qualms (neither of us knew at that point that you get gifted a big wedge of ADAM along with plasmids and tonics for every few little sisters that you save) and I couldn\u2019t help but smirk when the remaining little sisters brutally slew him after the final boss.\n\nIn games like Splinter Cell, Deus Ex, and Dishonored rather than kill them my opponents get knocked out, choked out or tranquilised wherever possible (I also like to indulge my passion for leaving their unconscious bodies in a lovely big pile in a quiet corner of the level). This could be because I\u2019m such a goody two shoes or an overreaction to the fact that for the majority of my gaming life killing enemies has been the only option.\n\nHowever, if before now my only way to dispatch enemies was to gently stroke their hair while whispering \u2018ssshhhh\u2019 until they eventually nodded off then maybe upon experiencing, say, Doom for the first time perhaps I\u2019d revert to a wild eyed savage screaming \u2018KILL! KILL! KILL!\u2019 while frothing at the mouth?\n\nMeestah Bull\n\nPS: It\u2019d be nice for games that offer the option to render your opponents unconscious rather than kill them, to reflect that in the dialogue. So, upon being spotted by an enemy (that after all, may just be doing its job) the shouts of, \u2018There you are, you\u2019re a dead man/woman!\u2019 become \u2018We don\u2019t want to kill you, surrender now!\u2019\n\nInbox also-rans\n\nIf I were in charge of Sony I would trademark PS76, just for gits and shiggles.\n\ntimmypoos\n\nI don\u2019t know about consoles, I\u2019d be surprised if the human race was still around in 2055. Although if both do happen to make it then I confidently predict the PlayStation 10 will be a mildly cool-looking black box, just like all the others.\n\nScorpy\n\nThis week\u2019s Hot Topic It\u2019s Halloween this week so the subject for this weekend\u2019s Inbox is a simple one: what\u2019s the most scared you\u2019ve ever been when playing a video game? It doesn\u2019t have to have been while playing a horror game, it could just be an unexpectedly scary moment in a normal game or maybe even something that the developer didn\u2019t seem to intend to be frightening. Do you enjoy scary video games and do you think they\u2019re more or less effective than movies and TV? Please remember that normal house rules apply for the Halloween Hot Topic: nobody\u2019s allowed to mention the dogs jumping through the window bit in Resident Evil 1.
