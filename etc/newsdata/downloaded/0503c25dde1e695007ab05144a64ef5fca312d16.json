I couldn't tell her that they could access all the photos she took - not just the public photos, but the intimate ones,' he writes.\n\n'I couldn't tell her that her information was being collected, that everyone's information was being collected, which was tantamount to a government threat: If you ever get out of line, we'll use your private life against you.'\n\nBefore summoning a small group of journalists to Hong Kong to disclose classified secrets, knowing that a return to the US was impossible, he says he prepared like a man about to die. He emptied his bank accounts, put cash into a steel ammo box for his girlfriend and erased and encrypted his old computers.\n\nThese days he remains outside the reach of a US Justice Department that brought Espionage Act charges just weeks after the disclosures.\n\nHe spends many of his days behind a computer and participating in virtual meetings with fellow board members at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. 'I beam myself onto stages around the world' to discuss civil liberties, he writes.\n\nWhen he does go out, he tries to shake up his appearance, sometimes wearing different glasses. He keeps his head down when he walks past buildings equipped with closed-circuit television. Once, he says, he was recognized in a Moscow museum and consented to a selfie request from a teenage girl speaking German-accented English.\n\nIt's unclear when or even if Snowden will return to a country where his family has deep roots. He traces his lineage back to the Mayflower and ancestors who fought in the Revolutionary War.\n\nHe was shaken by the September 11 attacks, but describes his 'reflexive, unquestioning support' for the wars that followed as the greatest regret of his life.\n\n'It was as if whatever institutional politics I'd developed had crashed - the anti-institutional hacker ethos instilled in me online, and the apolitical patriotism I'd inherited from my parents, both wiped from my system - and I'd been rebooted as a willing vehicle of vengeance.'\n\nHe describes the 18 years since the September 11 attacks as 'a litany of American destruction by way of American self-destruction, with the promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts and secret wars'.\n\nReporting by Ross Ibbetson for MailOnline", "description": "The former CIA employee and NSA contractor said he scoured the secret US documents and found no evidence of aliens, and also found proof the Moon landing and climate change are real.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/10/20125210-0-image-a-64_1571911050926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
