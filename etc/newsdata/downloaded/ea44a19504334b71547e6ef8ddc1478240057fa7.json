According to text messages released the first week of October 2019 by House investigators, Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker, a former special envoy to Ukraine, discussed Trump wanting to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Trump's Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his family. The House Intelligence Committee is scheduled to meet in private with Sondland.

No reason for the direction was cited, he said.\n\nLuskin says Sondland \"is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify.\"\n\nLuskin says Sondland \"believes strongly that he acted at all times in the best interests of the United States.\"\n\n___\n\n12:10 a.m.\n\nAn envoy wrapped up in a congressional impeachment inquiry was a late convert to President Donald Trump, initially supporting another candidate in the Republican primary and once refusing to participate in a fundraiser on his behalf.\n\nBut Gordon Sondland nonetheless donated $1 million to Trump's election effort and ultimately scored a plum post as U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nNow, a whistleblower's complaint and text messages released by another envoy portray Sondland as a potentially important witness to allegations the Republican president sought to dig up dirt on rival Joe Biden in the name of foreign policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sondland is scheduled to head to Capitol Hill to face questions about the episode.\n\nUntil last week, Sondland was far better known in his home state of Washington than in the nation's capital.", "description": "An attorney for Ambassador Gordon Sondland says the State Department has directed Sondland not to appear for his scheduled interview before a joint House committee taking depositions in the impeachment probe of President Donald Trump.
