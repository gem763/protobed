And there was one extra who was so enthusiastic in his laughter that it was throwing off my timing,\u201d Gulman told Collider.\n\n\u201cHe was just laughing too loud, and right when I was about to say something to Todd about maybe getting the guy not to laugh so loud, I realised that it was Joaquin Phoenix.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 17 scary films that were supposedly cursed Show all 17 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 17 scary films that were supposedly cursed 1/17 Rosemary's Baby (1968) Rosemary's Baby producer William Castle was convinced Roman Polanski's 1968 chiller was cursed. After its release, he was hospitalised with kidney stones and, after experiencing hallucinations during his near-death experience, claimed to have seen the film's lead character approaching him with a knife. The following year, Polanski's wife, Sharon Tate, was killed in the Manson Family Murders. Paramount Pictures 2/17 The Exorcist (1973) The Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn detailed a terrifying incident in which a fire burned the majority of the 1973 horror film's set to the ground. Despite it destroying the interiors depicting the MacNeil family's home, it somehow left the bedroom of the possessed Regan (Linda Blair) inexplicably untouched. Warner Bros 3/17 The Omen (1976) The Omen was plagued by a lot of terrible incidents: \u2013 Lead actor Gregory Peck and writer David Seltzer were on planes that were struck by lightning. \u2013 The stuntman standing in for Peck during the famous rabid dog scene was actually attacked by Rottweilers that bit through the protective gear he was wearing. \u2013 A zookeeper on set to tame baboons was mauled to death by a lion the day after completing their work. \u2013 Most tragically, though, after filming was completed, special effects director John Richardson and his assistant, Liz Moore, were involved in a serious car accident. Moore was decapitated in an incident that echoed one of The Omen's most disturbing scenes. 20th Century Fox 4/17 The Amityville Horror (1979) James Brolin claimed it was a ghostly presence that pushed him into appearing in The Amityville Horror; he was thinking about the role when an item of clothing fell off a hanger in his bedroom, startling him. Ryan Reynolds, the lead star of the 2005 remake, would later claim to have woken up at 3.15am \u2013 otherwise known as \"the witching hour\" \u2013 every morning without rhyme or reason. American International Pictures 5/17 Poltergeist (1982) Child star Oliver Robbins claimed he nearly died after being \"choked by the arms of the evil puppet\" featured in 1982 film Poltergeist. A few years after the film was released, young actor Heather O'Rourke died from cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by a misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis. She was 12. MGM/UA Entertainment Co. 6/17 Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983) Tragedy hit the Twilight Zone movie when director John Landis \u2013 who fell out with co-director Steven Spielberg due to unsafely cutting too many corners during production \u2013 pushed ahead with a stunt despite windy conditions. When a helicopter flew out of control, it came crashing down right onto the precise position where actor Vic Morrow and two child stars, Myca Dinh Le, seven, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, six, were killed by the whirring blades and falling debris. The incident, which saw Landis acquitted of manslaughter charges, led to greater regulations in on-set safety. Warner Bros 7/17 Maximum Overdrive (1986) \"You always felt like someone was going to die on this set,\" actor Laura Harrington said about Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive. The \"cursed\" film saw near-death experiences for cameramen and stuntmen as well as a hurricane, which hit the set during production. Camera assistant Silvia Giulietti would later say: \"Every day, we had security because the movie was a very dangerous movie.\" De Laurentiis Entertainment Group 8/17 Ghost (1990) Okay, Ghost may not be scary, but one of the biggest Hollywood urban legends goes that Poltergeist child star Heather O'Rourke haunted the 1990 film's set. Crew members claimed to have continually heard the footsteps of an unseen figure as well as a child laughing. The film was shot on the same sound stage where O'Rourke had filmed scenes as a child actor. Paramount Pictures 9/17 The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) The Exorcism of Emily Rose's lead star Jennifer Carpenter says she was haunted by a ghost that seemed to have a taste for the musical. She told Dread Central that, while she was working on the 2005 film, a radio would continually turn on by itself whenever she got home. Screen Gems 10/17 The Ring Two (2005) The watery death of Samara in The Ring made a freak incident that happened during production on the film's sequel even stranger: the entire set flooded. Lead star Naomi Watts also claims that she felt odd vibrations on set that she couldn't explain. DreamWorks Pictures 11/17 Insidious (2010) It was Insidious's hospital set where strange occurrences seemed to go down. While numerous members of the film's cast and crew complained about feeling unwell whenever they stepped foot onto set, there were also claims that a buzzer from an unoccupied floor of the building would continually go off. What was causing it remains unknown. Blumhouse productions 12/17 The Innkeepers (2011) A lot of the cast and crew associated with The Innkeepers experienced paranormal activity in the form of lights switching on and off for no reason. Doors would swing open and shut, frightening those who were present. Cast members even received phone calls that, when they answered, would have nobody on the other end. The hotel where the film was shot, the Yankee Peddler Inn in Connecticut, is known to be a hotspot for ghost hunters. Magnet Releasing 13/17 The Possession (2012) Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who starred in 2012 horror film The Possession, didn't believe in ghosts before filming began, but walked away convinced they are real. According to the film's stars, odd occurrences plagued the set, which included the explosion of light bulbs and cold breezes following them around. The possessed box at the heart of the film was later destroyed in a storage facility fire. Lionsgate 14/17 The Conjuring (2013) Vera Farmiga, who played real-life paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring, was so uneasy about making the film that she left the script outside her house. Despite this, one morning she woke up to find three slashes on her laptop screen. The eeriest thing, though, happened when the family whose real-life haunting the film is based on visited the set. Crew claimed that a \"strange gust of wind\" followed them wherever they went. Warner Bros Pictures 15/17 Return to Babylon (2013) Silent film Return to Babylon is said to have captured demonic activity on film. Director Alex Monty Canawati used an old-school camera with black-and-white film that he mysteriously found in a bag, but when he watched back what he'd caught on camera, the lead actors's faces had morphed into demonic-looking creatures. YouTube 16/17 Annabelle (2014) Annabelle's director, John R Leonetti, claimed to have seen \"three fingers drawn through dust\" on set multiple times\u2013 terrifying, because the demonic doll at the heart of the film has three fingers. Producer Peter Sarfran went on to tell The Hollywood Reporter about some strange goings-on during the film's shoot. \"We shot in this amazing, old apartment building near Koreatown, and we had some funky stuff go down,\" he said. \"In particular, the first day that the demon was shooting in full makeup, we brought him up in the elevator. He walks out and walks around to the green room to where we\u2019re holding the talent, and just as he walks under, the entire glass light fixture falls down on his head. And in the script, the demon kills the janitor in that hallway. It was totally freaky.\" Warner Bros Pictures 17/17 The Nun (2018) Annabelle isn't the only Conjuring spin-off that seems to have been haunted. Corin Hardy, who directed The Nun, says he saw two men in a room he was filming in at a castle in Romania. After completing the take, he turned to the men \u2013 assuming them to be members of the crew \u2013 but they were gone. Chillingly, they would have had to pass him to leave the room. Warner Bros Pictures 1/17 Rosemary's Baby (1968) Rosemary's Baby producer William Castle was convinced Roman Polanski's 1968 chiller was cursed.
