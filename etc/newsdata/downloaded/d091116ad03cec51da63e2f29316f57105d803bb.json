The new number is an increase of 62 cases from last week, when the CDC issued a statement about the investigation into the illnesses.\n\nPatients, mostly teenagers and young adults, often first report symptoms like breathing difficulty, coughing, chest pain and fatigue, officials said, which gradually grow worse and have resulted in hospitalization. Some patients also experienced diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nMany patients needed assisted ventilation, and some had to be intubated, according to the CDC, and one adult in Illinois died after being hospitalized for severe respiratory problems linked to recent e-cigarette use.\n\nWhy people are developing these severe illnesses is still unknown, but officials suspect that there is a connection to vaping, without linking the illnesses to a specific product. So far, the Food and Drug Administration has received roughly 80 samples of involved products for analysis, though many of those samples were missing complete information, according to the new statement.\n\nE-cigarettes usually contain nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals. Many e-cigarettes also contain substances such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a compound in marijuana, and cannabinoids.\n\nThe use of THC and cannabinoids was reported in many of the cases. But there is no one product involved in all of the cases, and there aren\u2019t any specific products in e-cigarettes that are currently known to cause respiratory illnesses, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with state and local health officials to investigate these incidents as quickly as possible,\u201d federal officials said in the statement. \u201cWe are committed to taking appropriate actions as a clearer picture of the facts emerges.\u201d\n\nIn addition to providing updates about the investigation, the CDC also issued a Health Alert Network Health Advisory, noting that people should consider halting their use of e-cigarettes while the investigation is continuing, if they are concerned about the respiratory health risks.\n\nIt also says that teenagers, young adults, pregnant women and adults who don\u2019t already use tobacco products shouldn\u2019t start using e-cigarettes, and people who do should closely monitor their own health.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe American Lung Association responded to the CDC health alert, calling on the federal government to give a clearer message and warn the public not to vape or use e-cigarettes.\n\nGregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, which advocates for the vaping industry, agrees that consumers should stay away from street-bought products, saying that \u201cblack market\u201d products with THC are playing a \u201cclear role\u201d in the illnesses.\n\n\u201cThe CDC and the FDA should be working to assure adult smokers and ex-smoker vapers that legally purchased nicotine vaping products remain a better alternative to cigarettes,\u201d said Mr. Conley.", "description": "Federal health officials warned the public not to buy e-cigarette products off the street or modify products they already own, as the number of people who have developed severe lung illnesses after vaping jumped in the past week.", "authors": ["Brianna Abbott", "Brianna.Abbott Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103000/social", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
