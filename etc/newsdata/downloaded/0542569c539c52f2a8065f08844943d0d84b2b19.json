His San Francisco 49ers come to FedEx Field this weekend as one of the NFL\u2019s best teams, at 5-0 and in first place in the NFC West. Snyder and Allen\u2019s team sits near the league\u2019s bottom, lurching in lost circles, searching for a replacement for Mike Shanahan\u2019s replacement.\n\nMany around the NFL expect Kyle Shanahan will try to bury the Redskins this Sunday, splattering his vengeance across FedEx\u2019s scoreboards. His words seemed to reflect this standing as they spilled from the speaker during a conference call with Washington media members. Much of what he said was deferential, complimentary to many in a city he says he enjoyed. But then he launched a shot. It was delivered subtly yet still roared into the building with a vicious, searing precision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty easy not to make [Sunday\u2019s game] personal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys who get personal with it don\u2019t play in the game.\u201d\n\nMore than five years have passed since the Mike and Kyle Shanahan years in Ashburn, a 24-40 debacle wrapped around the Robert Griffin III fiasco and cocooned by the 140-185-1 calamity of Snyder\u2019s ownership \u2014 enough time for Kyle Shanahan to become a Super Bowl offensive coordinator in Atlanta and a head coach in San Francisco. Enough time, too, for the NFL to see that whatever Kyle was doing deep in those team meeting rooms with his friends \u2014 all in their 20s and 30s \u2014 was genius.\n\nAnd as Snyder and Allen try to start the Redskins again, opening a search for the ninth coach of Snyder\u2019s regime, their pursuit will be clouded by the fact that they had not only Kyle Shanahan in their building but Sean McVay, the Super Bowl coach of the Rams, and new Packers Coach Matt LaFleur as well. While many teams are hunting for the so-called \u201cNext Sean McVay,\u201d Snyder and Allen are going to be haunted that the real McVay was working right down the hall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBecause of this, many executives on other teams think Snyder and Allen will have to look hard at their offensive coordinator, 34-year-old Kevin O\u2019Connell, whom former coach Jay Gruden had to promote two straight years to keep other teams from snatching him away.\n\n\u201c[O\u2019Connell is] in a good position considering the circumstances there,\u201d said one executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a frank opinion about another team\u2019s coaching situation.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a huge factor,\u201d another executive said. \u201cCan you afford to risk letting another guy like that get away?\u201d\n\nWith the departure of Gruden, O\u2019Connell is the Redskins\u2019 play caller. It is an audition of sorts, although Snyder and Allen have not said publicly if O\u2019Connell will be considered for the head coach\u2019s job. O\u2019Connell himself has always deflected questions about someday coaching a team, saying last summer, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be ready for when the time\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nThis is something the 39-year-old Shanahan doesn\u2019t have to worry about anymore. But his experience with the Redskins and the fact he has won and seems happier since could impact the thinking of any young assistant who might be courted by Washington. When asked on the conference call what advice he would give a young coach being pursued by the Redskins, Shanahan picked his words carefully.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJust look into it, see what the situation is and who you want to work for,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, anytime you get opportunities, you\u2019ve got to look into it. But I\u2019m not there, and I don\u2019t know how it is right now.\u201d\n\nThen he gave another subtle yet sharp swipe at Snyder and Allen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably not the person [the aspiring coach] would want to call on that advice,\u201d he said.\n\nIn recent years, a narrative has emerged about the young coaches on Mike Shanahan\u2019s Redskins staff. The story has come out primarily because of the success Kyle Shanahan, McVay and LaFleur have had and runs counter to the popular notion back then that most of the team\u2019s offensive ideas came from the fierce, omnipotent Mike Shanahan, who had been feared by many in his previous job as the Denver Broncos head coach.\n\nAD\n\nRather than being wide-eyed kids, tasting some of their earliest NFL experience, Shanahan, McVay, LaFleur and others were actually innovators, running a kind of football laboratory in the shadows of a war that was waged in the building\u2019s biggest offices.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think those guys knew that what was going on in there was amazing,\u201d said one person who was in Redskins\u2019 offices then, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide a frank assessment. The person made it clear \u201cthose guys\u201d were Snyder and Allen. \u201cThere was some exciting stuff going on in there, but they didn\u2019t understand what it was.\u201d\n\nThe short version of Kyle Shanahan, McVay and LaFleur\u2019s story is that they came in with Mike Shanahan in 2010 and set about modernizing the run-first, pass-second version of the West Coast offense that Mike Shanahan used in Denver. After Snyder forced them to take Griffin with the second pick of the 2012 draft, they had to create a new system to accommodate Griffin\u2019s speed and inability to fit the Shanahan offense. All the while, they were experimenting with new plays, ideas and concepts that they would take with them to their new jobs when everyone but McVay was fired after the 2013 season. The result of those hours lives in the combined 13-4 record of the Niners, Packers and Rams this fall.\n\n\u201cWe all became real good friends,\u201d Kyle Shanahan said this week. \u201cWe were all very similar in that we were young and we were eager to learn. We were always studying more stuff. And just being able to go through those four years together, there were a lot of ups and downs. You start out with an offense you want to run, then you learn that you\u2019ve got to adjust to a bunch of different personnel to be able to do that stuff and try things together. \u2026 I think we all knew that we respected each other a ton.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best part, Shanahan said, was the competition. As the young coaches tried to alter Washington\u2019s offense, they fought to come up with the biggest and best new ideas, each hoping to prove his thoughts were worth more than the others\u2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe thought each other would have great futures after there, and we enjoyed our time together,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nAsked if he thought all three of them would wind up as head coaches so soon, Shanahan paused.\n\n\u201cA lot of it has to do with luck,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be on the right teams [as a coordinator]. You\u2019ve got to make sure you have a good year when that happens so you get your opportunities. There\u2019s got to be an owner that wants to hire you.\u201d\n\nAs Shanahan said this, he was at the 49ers\u2019 offices, almost as far away from the Redskins\u2019 facility as one can be in the contiguous United States \u2014 his time there with McVay and LaFleur a fading bad memory. But the owner they left behind is looking for another coach, another start for a team that has been unable to get going for more than two decades now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo people familiar with Snyder\u2019s thinking describe him as being stuck, unsure of what he should do to bring the winning he has always said he craves. So maybe it was fitting that Kyle Shanahan\u2019s voice floated around the Redskins\u2019 facility again this week, if only for a few minutes of a conference call.\n\nThe ghosts of what he, McVay and LaFleur once had there hover heavy over the uncertainty.\n\nMark Maske contributed to this report.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Washington's latest coaching search begins with the ghosts of Kyle Shanahan, Sean McVay and Matt LaFleur looming over it.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0inzODKcMqnDej-8j5tHVSCf4dU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HHM33JW5S4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
