But there is less awareness of companies \u2014 generally referred to as data brokers \u2014 that collect, source and otherwise license information about consumers who are not their customers. The growing commercial use of data is outpacing the public\u2019s understanding.\n\n[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and, well, you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information.

Advertising helps consumers get relevant information to assist them in making choices on an endless array of goods and services. And it helps our clients \u2014 in sectors like financial services and banking, consumer goods, transportation and hospitality \u2014 to understand customers and deliver them marketing messages that are more relevant, consistent and effective. Data-driven marketing helps businesses reduce wasteful ad spending and helps fund free or low-cost consumer products and services on the internet, including free search, email and social media platforms, as well as customized content. In many cases, it also funds the press and other channels of expression.\n\nOur business is underpinned by policies on comprehensive data governance , in an effort to ensure that data use is transparent, fair and just, that there are benefits for both businesses and consumers. We help marketers follow the golden rule of business \u2014 \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d \u2014 so that they can deliver a better experience.\n\nUnfortunately, the irresponsible actions of some individuals and organizations have cast a shadow over our industry. They violate consumers\u2019 privacy, profit from stolen data and commit fraud. Increasing transparency \u2014 initially through a data broker registry and ultimately through a robust and balanced national privacy law \u2014 would help reduce the conflation of legitimate, regulated entities with unethical companies and criminals.", "description": "A federal clearing house would help separate the good and bad actors who deal in data.", "authors": ["Jordan Abbott"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/opinion/sunday/13Abbott/13Abbott-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
