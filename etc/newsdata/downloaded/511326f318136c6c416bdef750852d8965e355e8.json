It just takes time.\u2019\n\nKylie and Travis Scott split earlier this month (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nAnd she got stretch marks \u2018On my breasts, butt and thighs! I haven\u2019t gotten rid of them.\n\n\u2018Just accepted them as a little gift from Stormi lol.\u2019\n\nKylie hasn\u2019t had the easiest time of it recently, following her split from Travis after two-and-a-half years together.\n\nShe later hit out at claims she reunited with ex Tyga, after she was pictured making a late-night visit to the same hotel he happened to be recording new music at.\n\nTaking to Twitter, she fumed: \u2018The internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is.\n\nKylie is believed to have hung out with Tyga (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018There was no \u201c2am date with Tyga\u201d. You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at.\n\n\u2018Travis and I are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi!! Our friendship and our daughter is priority.\u2019\n\nAnd Travis was forced to address claims he was unfaithful to the reality star-turned businesswoman, amid speculation over his friendship with Rojean Kar (aka YungSweetRo).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlasting speculation on Instagram, he wrote: \u2018It\u2019s really affecting when u see false things said about u once again,\u2019 he told his 20.8million followers.\n\n\u2018Once again these false stories about me cheating are just simply not true.
