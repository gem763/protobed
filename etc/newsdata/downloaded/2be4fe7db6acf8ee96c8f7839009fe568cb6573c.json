We\u2019ve tested the Android app and find it to be a very capable mobile browser with plenty of unique features \u2014 especially for Vivaldi desktop users \u2014 but having yet another great browser app on mobile raises some important questions.\n\nAt this point, there are almost as many viable web browser choices for Android as there are for most desktop operating systems \u2014 so which one should you go with? The final answer is a matter of personal preference, and all browsers have their use cases, but picking a mobile browser isn\u2019t quite as simple as it can be on PC.\n\nHaving multiple browsers installed on desktop is not only totally doable, it\u2019s also smart; Chrome syncs up with all of Google\u2019s other services, and the Chromium version of Edge does much of the same for Microsoft\u2019s products.\n\nFirefox has quickly become the balanced choice between privacy, customisation and speed, while Brave attempts to create an entirely new ad-free experience and Opera has been experimenting with services like VPNs and other security features for quite some time.\n\nYou could easily have all of those browsers (and more) installed and actively in use on your PC, but it\u2019s a little more complicated on mobile. Because of the more limited controls and streamlined functionality of smartphones, many browser apps are trying to be your all-in-one solution, and most users will only ever need one \u2014 maybe two \u2014 installed at a time. But whether you\u2019re a mobile browser monogamist or like to play the field, Vivaldi is already a strong contender with a unique feature set.\n\nDespite only being in beta, the mobile app already includes many of the desktop versions\u2019 best features, plus some handy shortcuts for existing Vivaldi users. Here are some of the best features found in Vivaldi\u2019s Android app, including some that you won\u2019t find in any other mobile browser.\n\nSpeed dials\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nSpeed dials in Vivaldi are a lot like the speed dials in your phone\u2019s contacts: they\u2019re shortcuts to you favourite and most-used websites that you can easily access from the main page or in a new tab. They\u2019re basically grids of bookmarked sites, but they can be curated and organised for quick access.\n\nSearch engine nicknames and autofill\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse\n\nOne of the coolest features is the search engine nicknames. Vivaldi assigns various search engines a default single-letter \u201cnickname\u201d, such as \u201cb\u201d for Bing (which is the default search engine) or \u201cg\u201d for Google. Type the nickname ahead of your search query (for example \u201cg Lifehacker\u201d) in the address bar to quickly search without having to change your preferred engine or go to its homepage.\n\nTo find these shortcuts, open the Vivaldi app, tap the \u201cV\u201d icon in the upper right, then go to Settings > General > Search engine.\n\nNotes\n\nWhile you\u2019re browsing, you can open the \u201cNotes\u201d tab to save ideas or jot down ideas, save links, or copy/paste text all from within the Vivaldi app. Best of all your Vivaldi notes will sync between all your devices. While you won\u2019t find quite the same features as an app like Evernote or OneNote, being able to take notes while browsing from within a single app is pretty handy.\n\nNotes can be found by tapping the \u201cPanels\u201d icon in the lower left, then tapping the notepad icon.\n\nEncrypted cross-syncing\n\nIf you\u2019re already a Vivaldi desktop user, you can sign in to your account on mobile and sync your data and account preferences \u2014 including bookmarks, passwords, saved payment info, notes, speed dials, settings, etc. \u2014 between your devices. You can even access tabs open in other Vivaldi browsers you\u2019re currently signed into. All of your account data is secured using end-to-end encryption as well \u2014 and you know how much we like data security options around here, so we\u2019re pretty stoked to see that in Vivaldi\u2019s android app.\n\nShould you use Vivaldi on Android?\n\nWe definitely encourage Android users to give Vivaldi a shot if they\u2019re curious and want to see some of the above features for themselves. I found it to be responsive and able to load pages quickly in the few hours I spent with the app, but the customisation features like Speed Dials hold the most potential to set Vivaldi apart from its competitors. And I\u2019d definitely recommend pairing this with the web version if you want the best Vivaldi experience.\n\nHowever, as you might expect, it\u2019s not a one-to-one transition between the mobile and desktop versions. Some desktop features are absent from the Android version \u2014 like resizing UI elements or tab stacking \u2014 but again, the software is still in beta so more may be added in the future (though we can\u2019t say for certain).\n\nSpeaking of being in beta, users may notice stability issues while they use this early version of Vivaldi on Android. Vivaldi is asking users to report any major bugs and leave other feedback in a review on the Google Store page.", "description": "The highly-customisable web browser, Vivaldi, is now available in beta form on Android devices.
