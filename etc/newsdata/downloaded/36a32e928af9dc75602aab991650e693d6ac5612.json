(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 House Democrats are marching forward with their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, with more depositions coming this week.\n\nDemocrats are moving quickly to interview key witnesses and lock down information as they explore the question of whether the president compromised national security or abused his office by seeking dirt on a political rival from a foreign country. The probe was sparked by a whistleblower who revealed that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u2014 potentially in exchange for military aid money. Trump, who has defended his conduct as \"perfect,\" publicly called on China last week to investigate the Bidens, too. Calls to investigate the Bidens have come without evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden in either country.\n\nTrump's lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, says the calls for investigations are perfectly kosher, telling Fox News that the \"president of the United States has every right to ask countries to help us in a criminal investigation that should be undertaken.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the administration is continuing to offer mixed signals as it struggles to respond to the barrage and as the president lashes out by tweet.\n\nWhat's coming next:\n\nMORE DEPOSITIONS\n\nStaff and lawmakers from the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee will continue to hear from witnesses throughout the week. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who has become a key figure in the probe, will be deposed on Tuesday. And Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from the post early, will be speaking Friday.\n\nIt is uncertain whether two additional figures \u2014 George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in the European and Eurasian Bureau, and Ulrich Brechbuhl, a State Department counselor \u2014 will be making requested appearances, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo objected to the timing.\n\n___\n\nMORE WHISTLEBLOWERS\n\nA lawyer representing the original intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint launched the impeachment inquiry said Sunday that a second whistleblower has come forward and spoken to the intelligence community's internal watchdog, further complicating the president's case.\n\nAttorney Mark Zaid said the second person has information that corroborates the original whistleblower's complaint about Trump's dealings with Ukraine and has \"firsthand knowledge\" of key events. That threatens to undermine arguments made by Trump and his allies that the original complaint was politically-motivated and unreliable because it was based on secondhand or third-hand information.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Trump and his allies from continuing to try to undermine the source of the probe, while criticizing the way House Democrats are handling the inquiry.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of Trump's most vocal backers, argued that there was nothing wrong with Trump's July conversation with Zelenskiy. In an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" he said the accusation look like a \"political setup.\"\n\n___\n\nMORE DEADLINES\n\nThe House committees have requested a slew of documents from the White House as well as top officials including Pompeo, Giuliani and Vice President Mike Pence. Pompeo blew a Friday deadline for complying with a subpoena, but said over the weekend that the State Department had sent a letter to Congress Friday night as its initial response to the request. He also indicated a new willingness to comply, saying: \"We'll obviously do all the things that we're required to do by law.\"\n\nGiuliani and Pence have been given until Oct. 15 to turn over their documents, while the White House subpoena deadline is Oct. 18.\n\nDemocrats are moving swiftly and have said they hope to finish the investigation in a matter of weeks \u2014 perhaps even before Thanksgiving.\n\n___\n\nWHITE HOUSE RESPONSE\n\nTrump has offered a series of contradictory statements when it comes to whether or not his administration plans to comply with the House subpoena.\n\nAsked about the prospect Wednesday, Trump offered an inaccurate, though conciliatory response, telling reporters, \"I always cooperate.\" A day later, however, Trump had a different answer for the same question, saying he would instead leave the matter to his lawyers.", "description": "House Democrats are marching forward with their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, with more depositions coming this week.
