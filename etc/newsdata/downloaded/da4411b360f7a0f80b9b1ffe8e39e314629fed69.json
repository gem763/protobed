Non-GAAP earnings of $1.07 per share missed expectations by $0.11, while GAAP EPS of $0.92 missed by $0.31. Revenue came in at $22.01 billion, which was better by $690 million.\n\nThe stock is down slightly in early trading activity. Let's see what the charts look like.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of WFC, below, we can see that prices have been in a sideways trading range since December. Dips to the $44-$43 area have been bought while rallies to the $51-$53 area have run out of steam. WFC made a decent rally from August and even with a pullback earlier this month prices are above the rising 50-day moving average line and the slower-to-react 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been moving sideways since April and is turning to the upside and very close to a new high for the move up. A strengthening OBV line is a positive sign and tells me that buyers of WFC have become more aggressive.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is above the zero line in positive territory and poised to turn upward for a fresh outright go long signal.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of WFC, below,we can see that prices are trading above the now rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line has been moving up in fits and starts from December and tells us that there has been accumulation.\n\nThe MACD oscillator is rising and is ready to cross the zero line for an outright buy signal on this longer time frame.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of WFC, below, we see a bullish picture. The chart is producing a potential upside price target of $64 and a trade at $51.53 will refresh the uptrend. A trade down at $47.12 would weaken this chart.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Traders could use available weakness Tuesday to go long WFC. Risk a close below $47. Add to longs above $51 while looking for a rally to the mid-$60s.", "description": "Wells Fargo Could Rally Despite Disappointing Earnings...WFC", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Wells Fargo Could Rally Despite Disappointing Earnings", "Here'S How Traders Can Play Wfc Right Now.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Carolyn Boroden", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass", "Jim Cramer"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/47174fe0-a9c9-11e7-b5c3-a372d312468e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
