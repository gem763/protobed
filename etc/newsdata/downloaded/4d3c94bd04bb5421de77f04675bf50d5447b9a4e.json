We had some at the start of the season around the United game where he had a little go!\"\n\n(Image: Sky Sports)\n\nMourinho was relieved of his duties at Old Trafford back in December and is yet to return to management.\n\nHe has since been working frequently as a pundit on various broadcasting channels, where United have fallen foul of his criticism, among others.\n\nBut Lampard, who spent a period of time working for BT Sport, accepts that it is nothing personal.\n\n\"It\u2019s all good,\" he added. \"I\u2019ve sat in the punditry chair for a year so I understand the need to say things so I\u2019m certainly not going to bang on too much. In terms of him, yeah we have a relationship.\"\n\n(Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nChelsea have overturned their early season woes to put a run of four consecutive wins together in all competitions.\n\nThey now sit level on points with impressive 4th-placed Leicester , ahead of their clash with Newcastle at the weekend.\n\nLampard, 41, has done a decent job of producing results while giving the club's youngsters a chance to show their credentials, while also proving his.\n\nAnd he admitted drawing on the help of some of his other former managers for tips and advice along the way.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"Harry Redknapp is Uncle Harry so it would sound wrong if I didn\u2019t speak to him, but he was great for me in getting me the role at Derby,\" Lampard added.\n\n\"He was close to Mel Morris [the chairman]. He followed us brilliantly last year.\n\n\"He would text me and call me to talk about Derby and is doing the same at Chelsea so I have to shout Harry even though he is family.\n\n\"What he did for me in terms of getting me on the ladder managerially is huge and I will always be thankful for that.\n\n\"I had really good relationships with my managers. Guus Hiddink has actually sent me some great messages.\n\n\"But you move on a bit and it does become like you were more acquaintances but I have huge respect for all of them.\"", "description": "The pair enjoyed a successful relationship during Mourinho's time as Chelsea boss while Lampard was still a player", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Sky Sports", "Sunday Mirror", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646769.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-ENG-LCUP-MAN-UTD-DERBY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
