Perhaps unknown to protestors seeing red not green is the growing demand from Wall Street for bonds and other assets that promise to promote sustainability.\n\nGlobally there\u2019s been a significant spike in green-labeled bonds, which jumped from $78 billion in total value in August 2015 to $590 billion in August 2019, even as it remains difficult to measure green bonds against one another, according to a report released last week by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nFor many investors, the \u201cbragging rights\u201d that might come with a sustainable portfolio, or in simply bringing asset diversification to a traditional portfolio, may be enough to satisfy their goals. The IMF\u2019s research showed \u201cno conclusive evidence in the literature that sustainable funds consistently out[perform] or underperform conventional funds.\u201d\n\nBragging rights and uncertain returns aside though, how can investors be assured that the good intentions of a green-bond issuer will be delivered?\n\nUnfortunately, they can\u2019t.\n\nThere is no standard way to compare a bond\u2019s green claim, the IMF report shows. And these nonstandard investments risk feeding the phenomenon known as \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d whereby a company claims to be more environmentally conscientious than its operations allow. There are no set regulations that dictate the fiduciary responsibility unique to green investing, nor rules that require companies or government entities (Singapore is a green bond issuer for one) to quantify their climate exposure.\n\nTo solve this investing dilemma there needs to be more standardization, said Evan Papageorgiou, an author of the research report, and deputy division chief in the monetary and capital markets department of the IMF. That includes for green-focused investments and all assets within the category\u2019s more typical ESG label, referring to environmental, social and governance.\n\nFor instance, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, -0.14% recently issued $1 billion in green bonds. Pepsi distinguishes these green bonds from its traditional bonds by pledging to use the proceeds to help cut single-use plastic products and replenish the water it consumes in making soda and snacks.\n\nLike other companies, the Pepsi pledge is simply its own claim, although one formalized in the bond\u2019s prospectus and in sales pitches to sophisticated fund and pension investors. Pepsi\u2019s reputation as a routine bond issuer can help investors form an opinion on its green offering, as can its work as a major corporate signatory in some global green initiatives. Credit quality, another major determining factor for bond investors who are weighing risk against reward, has become more diverse for green bonds, but most green offerings are highly rated, with a small fraction below investment grade, the IMF data shows.\n\nRead: Why are green housing bonds not getting more love from ESG investors?\n\nEven if credit-quality confidence is secure and investors have weighed fee differences (the IMF report found that fees of sustainable actively managed funds are often higher than other active funds), investors are simply trusting that the bonds deliver on the green pledge as promised.\n\nPapageorgiou is optimistic that European Union efforts to address these concerns by developing standards for companies looking to issue green bonds \u201cmay create more momentum for a global standard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the private sector takes to it, standardization can go a long way in reducing greenwashing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IMF, which considers climate-change factors in assessing economic conditions, does not have its own set of standards for green bonds. \u201cWe are not a regulator, we do not set any investment standards,\u201d Papageorgiou explained. \u201cThe IMF is a trusted adviser of member countries and we believe standards can help the private and public sectors.\u201d\n\nOpinion: California\u2019s mass power outage shows we don\u2019t really know the costs or effects of climate change\n\nOne non-profit organization, the Climate Bonds Initiative, has attempted to develop a set of international standards for green bonds. Climate Bonds grants companies green bond status if it finds that the \u201cinvestment product is aligned to the Paris Agreement goals and the bond proceeds will be managed appropriately,\u201d as stated on their site.\n\nHowever, a company can still issue a so-called green bond whether or not it satisfies Climate Bonds\u2019 standards.", "description": "Investing in green bonds and other sustainable assets does not necessarily mean missing out gains from other funds, IMF report finds", "authors": ["Elisabeth Buchwald"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT235_bull_w_ZG_20191014100731.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
