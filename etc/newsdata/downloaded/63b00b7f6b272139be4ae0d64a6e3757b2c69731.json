USA TODAY\n\nWith the United States heading into one of the most important and divisive elections in its history, as the nation wrestles with challenges like climate change, health care costs and immigration, the final question at Tuesday's Democratic primary debate centered on comedian-turned-talk-show-host Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nThough Americans generally find DeGeneres' goofy dancing and good-natured pranks adorable, many social media commentators \u2013 and at least one presidential candidate \u2013 were not amused that CNN's moderators chose to ask about a celebrity rather than the more weighty issues facing the country.\n\n\"No, you are not closing with an Ellen question,\" tweeted one viewer.\n\n\"This question about Ellen is so stupid,\" tweeted another.\n\n2020 Election: 5 things we learned from the Democratic debate in Ohio\n\nMore: Here are the winners and losers from Tuesday's Democratic debate\n\nDeGeneres was brought up at the political debate because she was recently spotted enjoying a Dallas Cowboys game while seated beside former President George W. Bush. The images of DeGeneres, who is a lesbian, yukking it up with Bush outraged some LGBTQ-rights activists who remembered his opposition to gay marriage. Others criticized DeGeneres for playing nice with a man they consider a war criminal for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nDeGeneres addressed the controversy on her show, calling for more civility and explaining that she is \"friends with a lot of people who don\u2019t share the same beliefs that I have.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re all different, and I think that we've forgotten that that\u2019s OK,\" she said.\n\n\"In that spirit,\" CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asked the candidates to share a \"friendship that you've had that would surprise us\" and the impact that friendship had on them.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro was the first candidate to respond. He said he had valued friendships with people who think differently from himself, but he added that he thought it was possible to be kind while still holding elected officials like Bush to account.\n\nThere's a new frontrunner in town: Elizabeth Warren. Just ask her Democratic rivals\n\nLater, Castro said the failure to ask more substantive questions was \"journalistic malpractice.\"\n\nHe told MSNBC's Chris Hayes he'd hope to discuss the rising problem of homelessness in the U.S.\n\n\"But we talked about Ellen at the end,\" he said. \"And I know what the point of the question was, but we keep leaving some of these huge issues that impact families off of the question agenda of these debates.\"\n\nCastro and others were particularly perturbed that the candidates were not asked any questions about climate change.\n\nThree hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration.\n\n\n\nClimate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border.\n\n\n\nBut you know, Ellen.#DemocraticDebate \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro (@JulianCastro) October 16, 2019\n\n\"Three hours and no questions tonight about climate, housing, or immigration,\" tweeted Castro. \"Climate change is an existential threat. America has a housing crisis. Children are still in cages at our border. But you know, Ellen. #DemocraticDebate.\"\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee \u2013 a former 2020 candidate who campaigned on the importance of addressing global warming \u2013 was also appalled that the moderators never took the time to ask the candidates about what he considers the most important topic of today.\n\n\"Not one single question about the climate crisis,\" Inslee tweeted. \"This is the existential crisis of our time. Not one single question, and that\u2019s completely inexcusable.\"\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\nNot one single question about the climate crisis.\n\n\n\nThis is the existential crisis of our time. Not one single question, and that\u2019s completely inexcusable. #DemDebate \u2014 Jay Inslee (@JayInslee) October 16, 2019\n\nHere's a look at some other Twitter responses to the question about DeGeneres:\n\nMy answer to this Ellen question is that Republicans are trying to take your health care away. \u2014 Brian Schatz (@brianschatz) October 16, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve zoned out. This question was about Ellen? \u2014 Zerlina Maxwell (@ZerlinaMaxwell) October 16, 2019\n\nTwo hours and 45 minutes later, CNN still hasn\u2019t asked about climate change or campaign finance reform.\n\n\n\nCNN, just now: In the spirit of Ellen Degeneres, \u201ctell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us.\u201d\n\n\n\n*shrieks*#DemDebate \u2014 Emma Vigeland (@EmmaVigeland) October 16, 2019\n\nWait... did they really just ask an Ellen question? I can\u2019t. I\u2019m out. #DemDebate \u2014 Steven Canals (@StevenCanals) October 16, 2019\n\nNO. NO YOU ARE NOT CLOSING WITH AN ELLEN QUESTION. \u2014 Tommy Vietor (@TVietor08) October 16, 2019\n\nTHIS QUESTION ABOUT ELLEN IS SO STUPID. \u2014 Akilah Hughes (@AkilahObviously) October 16, 2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/16/democratic-debate-question-ellen-degeneres/3995105002/", "description": "Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said the failure to ask more substantive questions was \"journalistic malpractice.\"", "authors": ["William Cummings", "Published A.M.
