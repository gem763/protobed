At 83 and legally blind, she is only here for the tour, one of the many dreamers exploring this dusty outpost where Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic plans to launch one of the world\u2019s first suborbital commercial spaceships as early as this year.\n\nSpaceport America spokesman David Wilson envisions a launching off point for global travel, to build tourist resorts in space, colonise Mars and mine resources on other planets. He expects around 200,000 visitors to the spaceport each year, which was bankrolled by the state.\n\nThe rumble of rocketry promises to wake the nearby sleepy town of Truth or Consequences and its roughly 6,400 residents, and put it on the map for the first time since its last brush with fame a half-century ago.\n\nAmong quirky art galleries and old motels that pipe in hot spring waters from an aquifer that drew tourists generations ago, entrepreneurs are looking for a lift from the new notoriety.\n\nAn Italian restaurant serves a \u201cSpace-Port-a-Bellas\u201d mushroom appetiser. Ted Turner bought the historic Sierra Grande Lodge & Spa last year and plans to offer guests wildlife photo tours of his nearby 358,643-acre Armendaris Ranch.\n\nNewlyweds Val and Cydney Wilkes turned a burned-out motel into the Rocket Inn, which they hope will take off.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was joining in with the enthusiasm of building a great space future,\u201d said Val Wilkes, 54. Engineers from Space-X, a Virgin rival that also has a lease at the Spaceport, have been among their guests.\n\nThe venture is drawing a wide range of outsiders.\n\nGuests spilling out of a downtown party hosted by Cary \"Jagger\" Gustin included a Belgian documentary film crew and a man who had arrived by jumping freight trains.\n\nJeff Dukatt, 59, was hanging tie-dyed Spaceport T-shirts to dry outside his store when three Maseratis motored by, heading towards Spaceport.\n\nThe small downtown is a mix of trailer homes and cottages clustered among the motels and small businesses. Streets and dirt alleys are empty for much of the day, save for lizards basking in the blazing sun.\n\nA new Holiday Inn and Walmart on the outskirts of the town 140 miles south of Albuquerque hint at the changing character of the town in a time warp.\n\nFamous for its gushing mineral baths, in which Apache Indian Geronimo is said to have soaked, the town of Hot Springs sold out its heritage in the 1950s by renaming itself after a popular radio quiz show in exchange for free publicity.\n\nFor fifty years afterwards, show host Ralph Edwards visited at the beginning of May to host the annual T or C Fiesta.\n\nThe well-grounded weekend celebration today feels a century removed from the town\u2019s current trajectory. The sheriff\u2019s posse rode horses in this year\u2019s parade amongst homemade floats and the Hatch Chile Queen.\n\nKids nudged each other excitedly as they spotted a huge white Spaceport America fire truck cruising in the procession.\n\n\u201cWe want our 200 million back,\u201d heckled Scott Kennicutt, 50.\n\n\"How come you have a truck like that?\u201d shouted another spectator. \u201cYou haven\u2019t sent anyone up yet!\"\n\nThe Spaceport fire truck driver slowed down and leaned out of the window. \u201cComing quick, coming real quick,\u201d he responded.\n\nAt the rodeo grounds, children kept dusting themselves off after being flung from cattle, as they kept alive a tradition derived from the bull-riding and steer-wrestling of 16th-century conquistadors.\n\nA country song with the words, \u201cI\u2019ve got time to kill down in Brokenheartsville\u201d blared from a speaker as 11-year-old Caleb Griego was lifted onto a steer.\n\nThe animal bolted as the pen gate was opened. It leapt and shook in an attempt to toss Griego skyward. Six seconds later, the crowd roared as the buzzer sounded and Griego was still hanging on.\n\nThe boy approached the emcee to say he wanted to donate his prize-winning belt buckle to another competitor with cerebral palsy.\n\nThe gesture passed with little fanfare, as the next competitors lined up for a moment of glory before being launched into the air and crashing to Earth.", "description": "A sleepy town in New Mexico has found itself at the forefront of commercial space travel.", "authors": ["Lucy Nicholson"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ0FQgWDx4HGfzBbh8pr_gpNLoy7wYyIXy8MkwC7muwKaG8C9b9pVqacIZ1EbAO4uXgMQkZWHsHs78jx-r-VyXqbylLA5c8F3xzsZtYSkCYJz", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
