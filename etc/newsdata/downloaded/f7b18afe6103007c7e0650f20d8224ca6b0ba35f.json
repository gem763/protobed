Very little about this 3-3 Bears season has been ideal. No, the defense wasn\u2019t great against the Saints, but it can be. And when you\u2019re getting nothing from the offense, these things happen.\n\nMaybe Trusbisky was extra rusty in his return from a Week 4 injury. Maybe. More likely this is who he is. Does Chicago still think this guy is a savior, the way it did in 2017 when it dealt three mid-round draft picks to move up one spot to pick him second overall?\n\nThe Bears passed on Christian McCaffrey (eighth overall), Patrick Mahomes (10th) and Deshaun Watson (12th), each of them MVP candidates (or in Mahomes\u2019 case, the reigning MVP as well).\n\nWhat they got Sunday was a mess.\n\nCam Newton currently is injured but could use a change of scenery. (AP Photo/Mike McCarn)\n\nHis final line of 34-of-54 for 251 yards and two touchdowns doesn\u2019t do it justice. Much of that was gained late, when the game was out of hand. Trubisky had 23 pass attempts in the first half and gained just 73 yards. The first 10 Chicago drives lasted an average of 3.7 plays. The first 11 possessions netted just three points. With 4:33 remaining in the fourth, the Bears had 120 total yards.\n\nStory continues\n\nWorse, Trubisky\u2019s mistakes were the kind that are so obvious they can suck the life out of a team. The defense tired after allowing 10 first-half points. The running attack has become nonexistent \u2014 just seven rushing attempts \u2014 perhaps because no one fears the pass.\n\n\u201cWe have no identity,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cWe\u2019re just searching. We don\u2019t have any rhythm. We\u2019re not the offense we were last year.\u201d\n\nThey may actually have an identity, just not a positive one. Can that change? And can Chicago, which entered the season thinking Super Bowl, afford to wait and see?\n\nTrubisky hasn\u2019t shown much in two and a half seasons. He escaped major criticism last season when much of the fan and media attention was focused on the Bears\u2019 lousy kicking game \u2014 most famously in the 16-15 playoff loss to Philadelphia. It was Trubisky\u2019s offense that stalled out three times in the red zone and got stopped on the final, critical drive.\n\nThis season the Bears are 30th in total offense, 29th in passing, 28th in rushing and so on and so on. They just had a bye week to get Trubisky healthy and figure it out. They still haven\u2019t gained 300 yards in a game this year.\n\nIt was daring to move up and take Trubisky, a relatively unknown player out of North Carolina, as the first QB in the draft. Chicago was convinced. Others weren\u2019t, perhaps most notably Watson, who while at Clemson dominated the ACC only to watch a lesser player with just 13 career starts go ahead of him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to live with the consequences that come with it,\u201d Watson said before the draft. \u201c\u2026 I guess if that\u2019s who they\u2019re going to roll with, so be it.\u201d\n\nSo be it. And here are the consequences.\n\nCan Chicago, which last year dished two first-round picks to Oakland to grab Khalil Mack and turn a good defense into a great defense, admit its mistake with Trubisky and try to right the ship while there is still time?\n\nCam Newton has missed four games in Carolina due to injury, but he\u2019s expected back within the next two weeks. In his place, however, Kyle Allen has stepped up and gone 4-0. The Panthers might be interested in moving forward without their longtime star.\n\nNewton isn\u2019t what he was in 2015 when he was the league MVP. His 45 touchdowns that year (35 of them passing) look like an aberration \u2014 he has averaged 27.9 in his other seven full seasons. He brings a distinctive game and a big personality.\n\nYet former league MVPs aren\u2019t often available at age 30 \u2014 let alone one who might benefit from a change of scenery.\n\nIt\u2019s not ideal, but the original sin needs to be addressed. The defense is there. The kicking game can\u2019t be blamed anymore. An expected Super Bowl-contending season is in the process of wilting on the vine \u2026 and if Trubisky can\u2019t get the Bears to the playoffs this season, then the question lingers into the offseason.\n\nMaybe Chicago still thinks the guy it once believed would be better than Mahomes, McCaffrey and Watson can still become something great. Maybe they are right and staying the course is the move here.\n\nAs a once-promising season churns toward being lost though, that feels like as big of a gamble as making a move for Cam Newton.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Mitchell Trubisky looks terrible and with the Oct. 29 trade deadline looming, the former MVP might make sense for Chicago.", "authors": ["Dan Wetzel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iBJ5G6jz0iyMGS3186CqCA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W.rkPlKsflZSNRRfg79jBA--~B/aD0yNTIwO3c9Mzc4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d6dc2430-d960-11e9-8ef7-e6264a199d9d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
