It could signal to other countries that one way to curry favour with the United States is by digging up damaging information about Democrats.\n\nThursday also marked the latest instance of Trump saying aloud something that almost certainly would be a major scandal if revealed from a private conversation. Trump's request of China echoed his \"Russia, if you're listening ...\" appeal during the 2016 campaign for the Russian government to steal Hillary Clinton's missing emails and release them.\n\n\"Someone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count,\" Clinton tweeted Thursday.\n\nTrump and his allies have provided no evidence to back up their claims of wrongdoing. Hunter Biden joined the board of an investment advisory firm whose partners included Chinese entities shortly after visiting China in 2013 with his father while he was vice president. George Mesires, an attorney representing Hunter Biden, has said that his client acquired a 10 per cent equity stake in the firm in October 2017, and as of this summer that stake was worth about $US430,000 ($637,000).\n\nOn Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Democratic leaders denounced Trump's China comments and appeared dumbfounded that the president had given them live ammunition to use against him in their impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"The president of the United States encouraging a foreign nation to interfere again to help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president's oath of office,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said. \"It endangers our elections, it endangers our national security, it ought to be condemned by every member of this body, Democrats and Republicans alike.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse investigators deposed the first major witness in the Ukraine matter, Kurt Volker, who resigned last week as US special envoy for Ukraine after being named in the whistleblower complaint that sparked the impeachment inquiry. Volker testified Thursday that he warned Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that his information about the Bidens was untrustworthy and that his Ukrainian sources were unreliable, according to two people familiar with his testimony.\n\nAlso Thursday came the revelation that Trump ordered the swift removal of the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, earlier this year after hearing concerns from Giuliani, as well as former Texas congressman Pete Sessions, among others, outside of the administration, a senior administration official confirmed.\n\nGiuliani complained in a recent interview that Yovanovitch obstructed efforts to persuade the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. \"She is running around the streets of Ukraine going against the elected president of the United States,\" Giuliani said.\n\nIf you want to drive them crazy, just say eight more years or 12 more years or 16 . . . you'd really drive them into the loony bin. \u2014 Donald Trump\n\nCongressional Republicans, who rarely speak a cross word about the president, barely blinked at his China remark. The muted response from GOP lawmakers about Trump's call for China to investigate Biden presented a stark contrast to earlier this week, when many spoke out after the president tweeted congratulations to Chinese President Xi Jinping in celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist rule in Beijing.\n\nBy Thursday, however, most of those voices fell silent on Trump's latest Chinese assertion. Minutes after Trump called on China to investigate Biden, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, tweeted a link to a letter he sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that morning asking her to suspend the impeachment inquiry until she answers questions about the process.\n\nRather than condemning Trump's appeal to the Chinese, McCarthy prodded the speaker for clarity on whether the House would vote on an official impeachment inquiry, or whether Republicans would get subpoena power to call their own witnesses.\n\n\"As you know, there have been only three prior instances in our nation's history when the full House has moved to formally investigate whether sufficient grounds exist for the impeachment of a sitting President,\" McCarthy wrote. \"I should hope that if such an extraordinary step were to be contemplated a fourth time it would be conducted with an eye toward fairness, objectivity and impartiality.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPelosi responded to McCarthy's missive by noting that his request came \"shortly after the world witnessed President Trump on national television asking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\"\n\n\"As you know, our Founders were specifically intent on ensuring that foreign entities did not undermine the integrity of our elections,\" Pelosi wrote.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, continued his defiant stance Thursday, lashing out at Democrats and the media as he deviated from prepared remarks promoting Medicare, making an official White House event feel like a campaign rally. Addressing residents of The Villages, a retirement community in Florida, Trump mused about staying in office beyond his legal limit of two terms.\n\n\"If you want to drive them crazy, just say eight more years or 12 more years or 16 ... you'd really drive them into the loony bin,\" Trump said. \"That's why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can't beat us fairly.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Thursday marked the latest instance of Trump saying in public something that almost certainly would be a major scandal if revealed from a private conversation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2857%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f7205d16e6dfc55e570ed7d0d8992fcc3df69afc", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
