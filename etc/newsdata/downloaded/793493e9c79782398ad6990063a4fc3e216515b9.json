We take it for granted, never more so than when we whizz past fascinating slices of it in our cars without a sideways glance. It is \u2013 of course \u2013 because we\u2019re surrounded by an inexhaustible supply of it.\n\nThis drive is all about savouring some of those gems, whether it\u2019s the landscape itself or a pretty stretch of road, a fetching row of timber-framed houses or a grand cathedral.\n\nFew areas can match the sense of times past on this route that starts in Petworth, West Sussex, settled since at least Norman times and mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, before meandering through the beautiful and historic South Downs.\n\nIt takes in a stately home or three, an open air museum stuffed with a collection of time-worn buildings relocated from elsewhere, before romping through England\u2019s former capital city (fully 65 miles south of London), finally halting at a tranquil abbey which has eight centuries of history buried deep within its walls.", "description": "Overseas visitors \u2013 especially from the US or Canada where \u2018ancient\u2019 often means early 20th century \u2013 are often astonished at the tangible richness of Britain\u2019s history.", "authors": ["David Williams", "Dr Ken German"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2019/10/03/TELEMMGLPICT000201761997-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
