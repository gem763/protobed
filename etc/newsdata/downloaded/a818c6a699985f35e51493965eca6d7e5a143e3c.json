Universal Health Services Inc. expects to enter into a compliance agreement with the inspector general\u2019s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nUniversal Health Services Inc. is preparing to negotiate a compliance agreement with the federal government as part of a proposal to settle allegations of faulty billing practices.\n\n\u201cWe have presented to the government what our compliance program entails, and we think it\u2019s fairly robust and comprehensive,\u201d Steve Filton, finance chief of the King of Prussia, Pa.-based hospital-management company, said Wednesday during a health-care industry conference in New York.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nUniversal Health Services disclosed in July that it had reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice and various state attorneys general over billing practices in its behavioral-health division.\n\nThe company said at the time that it agreed under the proposed settlement to pay $127 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for services that didn\u2019t qualify for reimbursement.

The company is waiting to receive a draft of the agreement from regulators, Mr. Filton said, according to a transcript of remarks he made at the New York health-care event. Once USH receives the draft, it will begin negotiating the terms, he said. The company expects new requirements under the agreement to be incremental and \u201cnot really require fundamental changes in the business,\u201d Mr. Filton said. In the July disclosure, USH said a separate Justice Department investigation into alleged criminal violations had been closed. The company has denied it submitted any fraudulent billings. USH came under scrutiny in 2016 after a report by BuzzFeed that described the company\u2019s employees as exaggerating people\u2019s symptoms to admit psychiatric patients. The company at the time denied and disputed the allegations. Write to Kristin Broughton at kristin.broughton@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
