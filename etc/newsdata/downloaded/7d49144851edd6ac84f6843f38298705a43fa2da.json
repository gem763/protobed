Brady had taken Brown under his wing during their brief time as teammates, even inviting him to live in his house.\n\nHowever, it appears things have gone sour over the weekend, with Brown once again writing about a loss of guarantees. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported the team is \"not expected\" to pay Brown the $9 million signing bonus he was expected to receive in his contract. The pact had a total of $10 million in guarantees, and the Patriots released him before a $5 million scheduled payment was due Monday.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter cited a source saying Patriots owner Robert Kraft is \"never writing that check\" after Brown's comments. Brown was citing Kraft's arrest after he visited a massage parlor that was allegedly part of a prostitution ring. The case is currently ongoing, with prosecutors charging Kraft with soliciting prostitution.\n\nBrown is eligible to sign with any NFL team. Agent Drew Rosenhaus told Schefter teams have reached out to express interest, but they also want information regarding the NFL investigation into his status. It's considered unlikely that Brown is signed until the NFL investigation has concluded.", "description": "Antonio Brown 's seemingly gracious exit from the New England Patriots did not last long.
