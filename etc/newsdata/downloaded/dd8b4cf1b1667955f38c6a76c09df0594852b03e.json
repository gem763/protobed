But with 91% of votes counted, the big surprise of the night was that incumbent President Mauricio Macri narrowed Fernandez\u2019s margin of victory to seven points from a 16-point gap in an August primary.\n\nAnalysts and investors are now watching for two key items as they prepare for the market reaction come Monday morning. First, what the final composition of congress will be, and how that may impact key legislation ahead, including a debt restructuring. Second, they\u2019ll be keeping an eye on what signals Fernandez gives in his acceptance speech Sunday evening.\n\nRead More: Fernandez Leads Vote Count Against Macri: Argentina Updat\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect massive volatility -- markets will be waiting to see who Fernandez appoints to his cabinet and the economic plan he announces,\u201d said Jimena Blanco, political research director at consulting firm Verisk (NASDAQ: ) Maplecroft in Buenos Aires. \u201cIf anything, this greater balance could have a positive impact for those looking to acquire Argentine assets.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what analysts are saying:\n\nEzequiel Zambaglione, head of strategy at Buenos Aires-broker Balanz Capital:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to look at the numbers and see what the makeup of Congress will look like, especially in the lower house. But the main market driver will still be what Alberto Fernandez comes out and says in his speech\u201d\n\nAlberto Bernal, chief strategist at broker XP Investments:\n\n\u201cThe difference was tight, so Fernandez will have to be a little bit humble about the victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Fernandez win was priced in, but this tight of a difference was not priced in.\u201d\n\nThe results show that \u201csomething like 44% of Argentina is voting for economic orthodoxy, and still wants to do the right thing in terms of real adjustments. The populist view was not overwhelming, and I think that most of the market was convinced that it was going to be overwhelming.\u201d\n\nSiobhan Morden, New York-based head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Amherst Pierpont:\n\nFernandez\u2019s speech on Sunday will be hugely important to how markets react on Monday\n\nAlthough Fernandez would not officially take the top job until Dec. 10, \u201cthere is no honeymoon,\u201d and he will be expected to offer an economic plan and cabinet appointees quickly\n\n\u201cThe only solution for Argentina is reform-based fiscal discipline,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIf this is what voters are saying, it\u2019s that they expect responsible management.\u201d\n\nJimena Blanco, political research director at consulting firm Verisk (NASDAQ: ) Maplecroft:", "description": "Argentina Investors Look Ahead After Fernandez Pulls Out Win", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8cd2bfed713b285912df18127f84a00f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
