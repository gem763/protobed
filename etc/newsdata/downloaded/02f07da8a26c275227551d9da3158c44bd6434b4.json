REUTERS/Andrew Yates\n\n(Reuters) - Leicester City skipper Wes Morgan has said racist abuse in football has got worse since he started his career and the rise of social media makes it easier to target players.\n\nThe Jamaica international was speaking in the wake of England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier in Bulgaria, which was marred by a section of home supporters taunting black players with monkey chants and Nazi salutes.\n\n\u201cI have to say (racist abuse) is worse but on the basis that when I first started there wasn\u2019t the social media aspect to it all,\u201d Morgan told Sky Sports at a Black History Season event.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be the catalyst for most of this racist behaviour that is happening. At the moment it\u2019s an easy way to target players and say negative things, that is a problem in itself.\n\n\u201cThe social media side needs to be taken care of.\u201d\n\nMorgan said he was approached by the Premier League to be a part of their new BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) advisory committee formed with the aim of dealing with racism in the sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity and I\u2019ve got something to offer,\u201d the 35-year-old added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try and make changes for future generations to improve the game for them so it\u2019s easier for them to come through without having to go through racism in any capacity.\u201d", "description": "Leicester City skipper Wes Morgan has said racist abuse in football has got worse since he started his career and the rise of social media makes it easier to target players.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442207826&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0L0-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
