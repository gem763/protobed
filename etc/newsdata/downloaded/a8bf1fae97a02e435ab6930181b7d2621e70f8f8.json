Addiction can also result in death. There are many drugs which we know can be addictive. Some, like alcohol and heroin, can cause a physical dependence where the brain and the body move from wanting those drugs to needing them, just to function. Addiction to other drugs, such as cannabis and ecstasy, can be thought of as psychological, where brain processes such as memory and craving drive the addiction and keep a person stuck in it.\n\nWe also know that you don\u2019t need a drug to be addicted \u2013 some behaviours, like gambling and even internet gaming, are addictive, although the jury is still out about things like food and sex.\n\nHave we always been addicted?\n\nAddiction has been with us since we first worked out that there are things we can eat, drink, smoke or sniff which will make us feel better, at least in the short term. The ancient Greeks and Romans worshipped gods of wine and drunkenness, and in the 1700s in the UK, cheap gin lured more and more people into the taverns. By the 1800s, doctors and scientists were noticing addiction to drugs like opium, which had been initially prescribed for medical reasons. In 1884 there was enough concern that Norman Kerr formed the Society for the Study and Cure of Inebriety, which still exists in the UK today as the Society for the Study of Addiction.\n\nSince then, scientists, clinicians and drug users have come together to answer a range of questions: What is addiction? Why are some drugs addictive? Why do some people become addicted and not others? How can we treat and eventually eradicate addiction?", "description": "Addiction specialist Dr Sally Marlow with essential information about a modern scourge.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p069tz8n.jpg"}
