However distasteful they find him, Republicans largely back his agenda, whether it is the appointment of conservative judges, the passage of tax cuts, or deregulation.\n\nThey are even willing to tolerate his overturning of traditional Republican priorities like free trade, in part because of the damage they fear a vengeful Mr. Trump could do to them personally at the polls. The president has thoroughly taken over the Republicans, remaking the party of Lincoln in his image and institutionalizing policies that, only a few years ago, would have seemed extreme to them.\n\nMr. Johnson wants to engineer a similar takeover of the Conservatives, purifying the party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher so that it can repel challenges from the hard-core pro-Brexit movement, which now has its own competing party. If he clings to power, a more radicalized Tory party could yet emerge.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson offers little to supporters beyond a promise to leave the European Union next month. His other policies \u2014 tax cuts, more money for the police, tighter immigration rules \u2014 are standard-issue Conservative fare. Several of his rivals for the party leadership this spring ran on substantively similar platforms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much of a quid pro quo there,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.", "description": "However distasteful Republicans may find President Trump, they largely back his agenda.
