Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenBiden faces dual challenges from Trump, Warren Donald Trump thinks you're dumb Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks MORE\u2019s (D-Mass.) extensive labor plan to raise wages and strengthen the rights of workers is making waves with groups representing business, which are growing increasingly nervous about her candidacy as she rises in the polls.\n\nWarren's plan, unveiled Thursday, echoes arguments she\u2019s long made as a U.S. senator and presidential candidate: Workers\u2019 wages have \u201clargely stagnated\u201d while corporate profits and worker productivity has risen, it states.\n\nHer proposals to help workers include provisions long opposed by powerful business groups.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an understatement to say that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan could eradicate the franchise business model and put 733,000 small business owners out of existence,\u201d Matt Haller, the International Franchise Association senior vice president of government relations and public affairs, told The Hill.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce called her plan unconstitutional, echoing the rhetoric used to take aim at her proposed tax on corporations and organizations that spend more than $500,000 lobbying the federal government.\n\n\u201cRecycling failed policies of the past is not a winning formula for the future. In fact it\u2019s undemocratic, unconstitutional and bad for American workers,\u201d Chamber Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley told The Hill in a statement Thursday.\n\nOne element in Warren\u2019s plan is a call for legislation on \u201ccard check\u201d rules, which would make it easier for unions to organize workers by allowing a union to be certified if a majority of employees sign union cards or otherwise offer support. The Obama administration attempted to pass a card check bill when Democrats held the House and Senate during the first two years of that presidency, but it couldn\u2019t get enough votes in the Senate.\n\nRepresentatives of business groups argue card-check won\u2019t play well in purple states and could hurt a Democratic presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this would play very well in swing states like Iowa, Florida, North Carolina or Wisconsin,\u201d Haller said.\n\nCommunications Workers of America (CWA), the communications and media labor union, told The Hill that they fully support Warren\u2019s plan, saying it will be positive for working families.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t just cover up the problems with our current system with a fresh paint job. This is a full-scale renovation, one that will strengthen our democracy and transform the lives of America\u2019s working families,\u201d Shane Larson, CWA\u2019s senior director for government affairs and policy said in a statement on Friday.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee all of the proposals included in Warren\u2019s plan would be enacted if she wins the presidency.\n\nA number of the proposals could be enacted through action at the Labor Department, but many would require action by Congress. Democrats would have to net three seats to win the Senate majority.\n\nPushing changes through the National Labor Relations Board is also no guarantee. The board seats members for five-year terms, meaning a Democratic president would initially have some Trump nominees.\n\nService Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry voiced her support for the plan on Twitter on Thursday.\n\n\u201cGlad to see @ewarren plan's to overhaul America's broken labor laws, empower workers to organize millions at a time, allow innovation in cities & states, and use public $ to support good, union jobs. #UnionsforAll,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nAnother labor group noted that Warren\u2019s strategy to support new apprenticeships caught their eye as a positive proposal.\n\nShe would direct the Labor Department to set aside funding for apprenticeships on construction projects and partner with labor organizations to establish new training requirements, among other things.\n\nBut the Association of Equipment Manufacturers was troubled by the lack of workforce development ideas and efforts to close the skills gap in her proposal.\n\n\u201cAny candidate that\u2019s running for president \u2026 I think it\u2019s going to be absolutely critical for any of them to articulate and communicate an actual plan on how they would work with industry on how to get more young people interested in and incentivized to pursue career in the trades,\u201d Kip Eideberg, senior vice president of government and industry relations, told The Hill.\n\nHe added, \u201cwe cannot find enough people to take on these jobs because there are not enough people who have the training necessary to become a machinist or a welder.\u201d\n\nAnother element of her plan calls for passage of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would require \u201cemployers and unions to enter binding arbitration to secure a collective bargaining agreement within 120 days of negotiations,\u201d according to her proposal.\n\nIt\u2019s intended to address cases when employers refuse to bargain or delay negotiations. The bill in the Senate, introduced by Sen. Patty Murray Patricia (Patty) Lynn MurrayFreedom of the press under fire in Colorado Ninth woman accuses Al Franken of inappropriate contact Schumer throws support behind Pelosi impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Wash.), has 40 Democratic co-sponsors. It would also repeal right-to-work laws, which 27 states have adopted to allow people to work in unionized workplaces without joining the union.\n\nThe Chamber said the bill has \u201cmany pernicious provisions\u201d when it was introduced in the House in May.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce will continue to stand against failed policies, and will continue to work for labor laws that strengthen our economy and our workforce,\u201d Bradley said on Thursday.\n\nDavid French, senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, didn\u2019t think Warren\u2019s plan empowered workers, but instead put control into the hands of labor unions.\n\n\u201cI think you have to be fairly clear-eyed that just because a labor union represents workers does not mean that workers\u2019 rights are being enhanced,\u201d he said.", "description": "Sen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/warrenelizabeth_100219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
