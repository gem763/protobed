He said it 'clung on for dear life,' once back in safety\n\nTom said that when he found the squirrel, it was terrified. He said it looked like it had dropped from a tree and swam 100-130 feet\n\nKnowing he had to save the critter, he picked it up from the water with his paddle and dropped it in the kayak for safety.\n\nHe told the BBC that he was used to seeing seals and dolphins in the water but this was his first experience of witnessing a swimming squirrel.\n\nTom put the creature in his lap.\n\nTom said: 'I was out with two customers when I came across the squirrel.\n\n'I had been telling them all about the history of the area and keeping them safe.\n\n'It was in the middle of the Helford, it looked like it had dropped of a tree on the Lizard side so it must have swam a good 30 or 40 metres (100-130 feet).\n\nAfter he rescued the squirrel, he said he put it in a tree but it remained 'frozen' from shock\n\n'It was nearly dead when I found it, I picked it up and put it between my legs and it clung on for dear life.'\n\nHe continued: 'I took the squirrel to the nearest beach and set it down but it just sat there frozen.\n\n'I decided to put it in the most natural place for a squirrel - a tree - but it was still just frozen.\n\n'It must have been in shock, because after about 15 minutes it shook itself off and ran up the tree.\n\n'We love all wildlife, whether it's marine or woodland critters, and will always stop to help an animal in distress.'", "description": "A kayaker has rescued a drowning squirrel after it swam 100ft out into a Cornish river.
