But as NHK reports, Hayao Miyazaki has turned down that offer. But you can look forward to a kabuki adaptation this December.\n\nAnnounced last year, the kabuki version will star Onoe Kikunosuke as Nausica\u00e4 and Nakamura Shichinosuke as Princess Kushana. Keiko Niwa, who has written several Ghibli films, is penning the script.\n\nIn the past few years, several well-known manga, including One Piece, have been adapted into kabuki plays. A live-action version of Nausica\u00e4, however, seemed unlikely.\n\n\u201cFor Miyazaki, out of all the various works he\u2019s done, Nausica\u00e4 is the most important,\u201d said Studio Ghibli producer Toshi Suzuki at a press conference for the kabuki version (via Jiji Press).\n\nThe Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind manga ran from 1982 and 1994. An feature animated version was released in 1984.\n\nTalks about a kabuki version of Nausica\u00e4 began several years back. \u201cI thought he was going to be put off by it,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cThere had been various requests to do a live-action version, even from Hollywood. He turned them all down.\u201d\n\nKnowing how important Nausica\u00e4 is for Miyazaki, Suzuki was willing to offer Princess Mononoke, instead, thinking that it would be suitable for kabuki. Previously, Studio Ghibli okayed a Princess Mononoke stage version that debuted in London in 2013.\n\nBut this time, Miyazaki gave the green light for Nausica\u00e4. However, he had two stipulations. \u201cFirst, he said that he didn\u2019t want the title of Nausica\u00e4 changed,\u201d said Suzuki. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said. Second, he would not offer assistance to press events and whatnot.\u201d\n\nThe kabuki version will run from December 6 to 25 in Tokyo.", "description": "Don\u2019t expect a Hollywood version of Nausica\u00e4.
