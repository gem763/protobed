Rookie Dwayne Haskins received some first-team reps, but coach Jay Gruden said he anticipated Keenum starting \u201cunless he has a setback.\u201d\n\nKeenum suffered a foot sprain in Monday\u2019s loss to the Chicago Bears, causing him to miss one day of practice. The 31-year-old underwent an MRI on Wednesday and had to wear a walking boot.\n\nHe didn\u2019t limp when throwing the ball Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s feeling better,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cShort week, you know how these things go. Pretty sore after the game, wanted it to calm down, get a little swelling out. Stabilize it. Just walking around, they put me in it for the day.\u201d\n\nAgainst the Bears, Keenum had his worst performance with the Redskins. He threw three interceptions and lost two fumbles \u2014 leading some to call for Haskins to start.\n\nBut Gruden backed Keenum as the starter, saying he\u2019d stick with him until he no longer felt the signal-caller gave them the best chance to win.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be better going forward,\u201d Keenum said Tuesday after reviewing the game film.\n\nColt McCoy also practiced in full Thursday \u2014 meaning all three Redskins participated in practice for the first time since Aug. 13. McCoy is working his way back from a leg injury suffered last season.\n\nBesides the quarterbacks, guard Brandon Scherff (ankle) and center Chase Roullier (knee) missed practice for the second straight day. Both players suffered injuries in the Bears loss and were initially listed as day-to-day.\n\nIf Scherff or Roullier can\u2019t go, veteran Tony Bergstrom will play in one of their spots. If both starters are out, rookie guard Wes Martin could make his season debut.\n\nRookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin also popped up on the injury report Thursday with a hamstring injury. He was limited in practice. Asked if the injury was serious, Gruden said, \u201cI sure hope not.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins, meanwhile, are looking to avoid an 0-4 start for the first time since 2001.\n\nShould Keenum suffer a setback, Gruden said he feels \u201cpretty good\u201d if he needed to turn to Haskins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have a plan for him if he did go in without a doubt. As we would with anybody, but he did fine,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI think the most important thing for him is to make sure you continue to study protections and all that stuff, so you can protect yourself with all the blitz looks that teams give you on third down especially. Other than that, he\u2019s done a nice job.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
