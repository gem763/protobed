Johnson has called for a U.K. parliamentary vote on Saturday.\n\nWhat are major indexes doing?\n\nFutures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YMZ19, +0.33% rose 100 points, or 0.4%, at 27,040, while S&P 500 futures ESZ19, +0.36% advanced 10.85 points, or 0.4%, to 3,002.25.

Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party, a key ally of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, said it remained opposed to the draft agreement.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the reaction is short-lived as the politicians go toe-to-toe again at the weekend, but in the meantime the very possibility of an agreed outcome to the painful Brexit saga has resulted in a relief rally, both financial and psychological,\u201d said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. stocks have reacted positively overall to the start of third-quarter earnings season.\n\n\u201cEven though it is very early in the Q3 earnings reporting period, investors have been encouraged by the better-than-expected results for the large diversified banks and selected health care companies,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, in a note.\n\nThat enthusiasm was offset Wednesday by weaker-than-expected September retail sales numbers, while uncertainty around U.S.-China trade talks continues to cast a cloud over the market. Overall, the potential for elevated volatility is expected to remain a concern for investors since October has recorded nearly 40% higher volatility than the other 11 months since World War 2, Stovall said, noting CFRA still expects to see share prices end the year higher on an improvement in earnings per share expectations.\n\nWhat companies are in focus?\n\nShares of Honeywell International Inc.
