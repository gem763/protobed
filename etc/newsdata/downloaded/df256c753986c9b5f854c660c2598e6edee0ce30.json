REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo\n\nRepresentatives of the biofuels sector accused the administration of \u201crampant abuse\u201d of the so-called Small Refinery Exemptions (SRE) freeing refineries from their annual ethanol blending obligations, while the nation\u2019s top refining association argued the program was critical to national security by keeping petroleum fuel producers in business.\n\nBut the two sides agreed on one thing: the administration\u2019s recent proposal to remedy the small refinery waiver issue by forcing some bigger refineries to make up for the exempted volumes was a disappointment.\n\nGeoff Cooper, the head of the Renewable Fuel Association, called it a \u201cbait and switch\u201d that did not go far enough to \u201cbring idled (biofuel) plants back online.\u201d\n\nChet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, called it \u201cunfair\u201d to parts of the refining industry that would have to blend more biofuels with petroleum-based fuels.\n\nThe hearing, set by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, aired out the grievances of two key political constituencies heading into next year\u2019s election at a time President Donald Trump has been working hard to win them over.\n\nThe U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires the refining industry to use 15 billion gallons of ethanol every year to replace or reduce the quantity of petroleum-based transportation fuel, heating oil or jet fuel. But small individual facilities can secure exemptions if they prove compliance would cause them disproportionate economic harm.\n\nTrump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has vastly expanded its use of the waivers, which are issued confidentially, triggering a backlash among representatives of the corn industry who claim the exemptions are lucrative handouts to Big Oil and hurt farmers by cutting ethanol blending volumes.\n\nAfter picking up on the corn industry\u2019s anger, Trump promised a \u201cgiant package\u201d to remedy the issue. Early this month, the EPA unveiled the plan, which would increase the amount of ethanol some oil refineries must blend next year to make up for volumes it has waived.\n\nBiofuels companies have instead reacted angrily \u2013 saying the proposal failed to make up for the impact of the waiver program so far and fell short of the administration\u2019s promises. The industry had expected the EPA to calculate the increased volumes by using the three-year average of volumes waived under the SRE program, but it instead said it would use the three-year average of volumes that the Department of Energy had recommended that the EPA waive - a lower number.\n\n\u201cIt falls woefully short of the president\u2019s advance billing,\u201d Gene Gebolys, chief executive of the biofuels producer World Energy, told the hearing.\n\nThe oil industry, meanwhile, also dislikes the proposal. Refiners see ethanol as competition for petroleum-based fuels and argue the EPA\u2019s new proposal unfairly forces big refineries to bear the burdens of their smaller competitors.\n\nThe refining industry also refutes accusations that the waivers have impacted overall demand for ethanol, arguing that the U.S. trade war with China has been a much bigger factor behind falling agricultural commodity markets.", "description": "The U.S. oil and corn industries continued a long-running public battle over America\u2019s biofuels policy on Tuesday during a Congressional hearing about the Trump administration\u2019s use of \u201csecret waivers\u201d for refineries.", "authors": ["Richard Valdmanis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446242921&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1IJ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
