And it had nothing to do with his recent loss at the Japanese Grand Prix and everything to do with saving the planet.\n\nOn his Instagram Stories, the Formula One driver wrote he \"felt like giving up on everything\".\n\n\"Honestly, I feel like giving up on everything. Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don't seem to care?\n\n\"I'm going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a d**n about the world.\"\n\nMany of his fans were quick to throw their support behind him, telling him not to despair, Daily Mail reports.\n\n\"Please don't give up on the world. There are people that care, while the world may seem c**p at times you have to look for the positives. I promise you there are some,\" replied one fan.\n\n\"I\u2019m so concerned about Lewis. Hope he\u2019s okay,\" another wrote.\n\nThe 34-year-old driver, who\u2019s the UK\u2019s richest sportsman with a fortune of around \u00a3187 million (about R3,5 billion), is an avid environmentalist. After turning vegan two years ago, he announced his plans to launch a meat-free fast-food chain in a bid to help reduce greenhouse gasses created by livestock.\n\nLast month he opened his first vegan burger restaurant, called Neat Burger, in London\u2019s West End and he\u2019s planning a US launch next year as well as 14 outlets in Europe over the next two years.\n\n\"As the human race, what we\u2019re doing to the world . . . the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"They say it\u2019s more than what we produce with our flights and our cars, which is kind of crazy to think, the cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"\n\nAmen to that.\n\nSources: Daily Mail, Instagram, The Guardian\n\n", "description": "Many of his fans were quick to throw their support behind him, telling him not to despair.", "authors": ["Nici De Wet"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9487/503143e78f34482bba2da7ff6e53f370.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
