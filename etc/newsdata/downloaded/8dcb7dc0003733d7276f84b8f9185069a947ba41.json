Republican senators who usually stand in lock step with Trump said the move amounted to abandoning Syrian Kurdish fighters who had fought ISIS alongside American troops.\n\nTrump signaled Monday he was listening to the criticism. \"I told Turkey if they do anything that is not humane, Turkey will suffer a very decimated economy,\" Trump told reporters at the White House. \"If Turkey does anything that they are not supposed to do, we will hit them so hard in their economy.\u201d\n\nAs Turkey pushed forward with their operation Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who is normally a staunch supporter of Trump, blasted Trump again. \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\u201d Graham tweeted Wednesday. \u201cThis move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\nTrump said in his statement Wednesday that Turkey had \u201ccommitted to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place.\u201d The president added that the United States would \u201chold them to this commitment.\u201d He did not specify how the administration would do so, although he has in recent days floated the prospect of economic punishment.\n\nTrump also warned in a tweet Monday that, \"if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey.\" He did not specify what would qualify as \"off limits.\"\n\nAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nTurkey considers the YPG to be a terrorist organization and a part of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a Kurdish nationalist movement that is banned in Turkey. The Turkish state has been battling Kurdish separatists in its own territory for decades and has even invaded Syria to fight against Syrian Kurds several times in recent years.\n\nBali had earlier warned of a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\" In the hours leading up to Turkey's invasion, he called on the U.S.-led coalition that collectively fought ISIS to \"carry out their responsibilities and avoid a possible impending humanitarian disaster.\"\n\n\"The border areas of northeast Syria are on the edge of a possible humanitarian catastrophe,\" Bali said in a statement Tuesday. \"This attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded\n\nTurkey's president said the operation in northeastern Syria targeting the YPG/PKK will \"neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes.\"\n\n\"We will preserve Syria's territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists,\" Erdogan tweeted Wednesday.\n\nTrump also said that Turkey was no responsible for holding thousands of ISIS prisoners the Syrian Kurds had been guarding.\n\n\"Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form. We expect Turkey to abide by all of its commitments, and we continue to monitor the situation closely,\" Trump said.\n\nISIS, which grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq, took root in northern and eastern Syria in 2013 during the country's ongoing civil war, after seizing swaths of territory in neighboring Iraq. The jihadist group sought to overthrow Syrian President Bashal al-Assad's regime and establish a caliphate.\n\nIn 2014, as ISIS carved out territory in Syria, the United States led a coalition of countries to conduct airstrikes targeting the group. The military coalition ultimately teamed up with the Syrian Democratic Forces to liberate the ISIS-held territories in northeastern Syria -- a partnership that angered Turkey.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition provided crucial air support, weapons and logistical advice, but it was the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that sacrificed many of its soldiers on the battlefields. ISIS lost control of its last foothold in Syria earlier this year.\n\nNegotiators from the United States and Turkey reached an agreement on Aug. 7 to create a safe zone in northeastern Syria in order to secure the territory, which is now under Kurdish control, and keep out ISIS. But Erdogan still threatened to take up an offensive against the Kurds.\n\n\"The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so. They have been fighting Turkey for decades,\" Trump tweeted on Monday morning. \"I held off this fight for almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump called the operation in northeast Syria a", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/turkey-1-sh-er-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
