Most of those who supported impeachment failed to provide reasons.\n\n\u201cI think he should be impeached,\u201d a student told Phillips, but responded, \"I'm sure there are reasons I don\u2019t know of\" when asked why.\n\nCONSERVATIVE STUDENTS THREATENED WITH DOXXING AT TEXAS COLLEGE\n\nAnother student said Trump should be impeached.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that into politics, I don\u2019t pay that much attention to it,\u201d she said about the reasons for impeachment, calling Trump \"full of hate\" toward immigrants and minorities.\n\nShe said: 'As a Hispanic I feel like he's just against minorities in general, which makes up a lot of the country.\"\n\nAnother student said Trump should \u201cabsolutely\u201d be impeached.\n\nWhen asked for his reasoning, he said, \"Honestly, I think it\u2019s a lot of just how popular he is and so, even though you\u2019re so popular and poppin\u2019 right now, it\u2019s not good for America.\u201d\n\nPhillips said \u201cMillennials are now the largest voting bloc in America\" and college students should not \"get a pass\" for not staying informed. He said there were no students who argued against Trump's impeachment and even if there were, they'd be \"afraid\" to express such an opinion.\n\n\"It's easy to laugh this off and say this is just silly college students, but you have to remember that their vote counts just as much as yours and mine,\" Phillips said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we should hope to have an educated electorate,\" Phillips added, \"and so, I think when you see videos like this, it\u2019s a reminder of what happens when you have an echo chamber and just how important it is we to encourage people to think critically for themselves and not pressure to support one side over the other.\"\n\nThe House of Representatives moved forward on impeachment inquiry this week, though they have not held a formal vote on the matter. Democrats accuse President Trump of abusing his office by requesting that Ukraine investigate his potential 2020 election rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.", "description": "As House Democrats push for an\u00a0impeachment inquiry against President Trump,\u00a0Campus Reform's Cabot Phillips traveled to a Virginia campus to ask college students about why such action should be taken.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/students.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
