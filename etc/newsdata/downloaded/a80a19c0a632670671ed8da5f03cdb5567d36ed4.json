If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nEverybody likes to joke about not knowing what women want, but in all seriousness, what do men want? If you're shopping for a friend, boyfriend, husband, or an in-law this holiday season, you might be struggling to figure out what to get them as a gift, and nobody would blame you.\n\nNever fear: Reviewed is here! We test all kinds of things\u2014from home beer kits, to smartwatches, to $3,000 TVs\u2014all year round to find the best of the best when it comes to products, and every holiday season we're like a full Santa sack of opinions and recommendations for even the most difficult-to-shop-for person. Here are 20 gifts we highly recommend for the men on your Christmas list.\n\n1. For the music lover: Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones\n\nBest gifts for wives 2019: Sony WH-1000XM3 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you're shopping for a guy who loves music, you cannot\u2014and I repeat, you cannot\u2014go wrong with these over-ear wireless noise-canceling headphones from Sony. Newly released this year, the WH-1000XM3 are stylish, comfortable, sound amazing, and block a ton of ambient noise. They're a great gift for frequent travelers, sure, but with customizable EQ and long battery life, they're really a perfect choice for any guy on your list who loves jamming to tunes. Oh, and just to sweeten the pot, they're Alexa-compatible too.\n\nGet the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones from Amazon for $348\n\n2. For the man who loves pizza: Progressive International PL8 pizza wheel\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Progressive International PL8 (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nOkay, you don't have to be obsessed with pizza to want this artisan pizza wheel: it took our #1 spot when we tested the best pizza cutters of 2019, and is probably better than whatever pizza cutter you've already got (you do have a pizza cutter, don't you?). Surprisingly weighty and substantive-feeling, this pizza wheel from Progressive International is sure to become a favored tool of your pie-loving giftee, especially if he likes a hard-to-cut crispy crust. Just don't blame us if he ends up eating a few-too-many homemade pizza pies over the holiday season.\n\nGet the Progressive International PL8 pizza wheel from Amazon for $19.95\n\n3. For the guy who's always hot: Vornado 660 Fan\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Vornado 660 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nWe all know that one guy: still wearing a t-shirt in the winter, sweating when he's not in frosty AC indoors, or simply struggling to cool off at night before bedtime. Some people just run hot\u2014I'd know, I'm one of them. Well, believe it or not, we tested to find the best fans this year, and the Vornado 660 turned out to be the windy winner. It managed almost 12 mph winds at a distance of three feet away, which was much better than most of the other contenders. I guess you could say we're big fans of this one.\n\nGet the Vornado 660 fan from Amazon for $94.99\n\n4. For the man who games on the go: Dell Inspiron 15 gaming laptop\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Dell Inspiron 15 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nGaming\u2014and specifically PC gaming\u2014can be an expensive hobby, but it's also wildly popular. I'm willing to bet someone you're shopping for this year plays video games, and if so, you might want to think about gifting an affordable gaming laptop. When we tested this Dell Inspiron 15, we found it to be one of the best you can get under $1,000. Dell cut corners on the screen (it's a bit dim and undersaturated looking), but for less than $800 you're getting very respectable specs: an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. While this won't stand in as a replacement for a PC tower, it's a great way to play PC games in a portable, reliable manner at a price that's very reasonable.\n\nGet the Dell Inspiron 15 gaming laptop from Walmart for $734.99\n\n5. For the avid home chef: Philips XXL Airfryer\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Philips XXL Airfryer (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you haven't heard about air fryers yet, you're in for a bit of a treat. These countertop small appliances aim to cook up food in a way that's reliably crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, kind of like you'd get at a casual restaurant. How do we know? You guessed it\u2014we tested 'em. As it turns out, the big Philips XXL Airfryer is the champ in 2019, producing french fries during our testing that we just couldn't stop eating. Even if the guy you're buying for doesn't love frying delicious things up, he may start once you get him this air fryer, and then it's like, two gifts.\n\nGet the Philips XXL Airfryer from Amazon for $199.95\n\n6. For the guy who loves movie night: JBL Bar 2.1 soundbar\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: JBL Bar Studio 2.1 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you're shopping for a guy who loves watching movies at home, but you don't like him enough to spring on a new TV, an audio upgrade is the next best thing. A soundbar like this one is eons better sounding than stock TV speakers, and even features useful extras like dialogue boosting and a wireless subwoofer for discreet-but-powerful bass. Really, any giftee who uses a TV regularly could benefit from a soundbar, and this one took our Best Value spot when we tested the best soundbars under $500, making it a smart gift for anyone looking to upgrade their home theater experience.\n\nGet the JBL Bar 2.1 soundbar from Amazon for $296.14\n\n7. For the bookworm: Kindle Paperwhite\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Kindle Paperwhite (Photo: Reviewed / Michael Roorda)\n\nWe all know that one guy that loves books. Heck, maybe you know more than one, I don't know your life. Give his bookshelf and backpack a break this year and get him the latest Kindle. The new Paperwhite\u2014available in black or twilight blue\u2014ups the previous Kindle ante by adding waterproofing, improved Audible support, a generous 8GB of storage, and a built-in light to allow for easier reading outdoors. With the ability to hold hundreds (if not thousands) of books, magazines, comics, and PDFs, it could be just what your bookworm friend needs to stem their out-of-control book collection.\n\nGet the Kindle Paperwhite (8GB) from Amazon for $149.99\n\n8. For the smartphone addict: Yootech X2 wireless charger\n\nBest Christmas gifts men 2019: Yootech X2 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\n\"Hang on, just gotta charge my phone.\" \"Do you have a phone cable I can borrow for a bit?\" \"Sorry I didn't get back to you, my battery died.\"\n\nWe all know this guy. Fortunately, Reviewed also knows what he needs: our top-ranked wireless phone charger, the Yootech X2. During testing, the X2 offered the best combination of fast charging, versatility, and value. While this won't keep your smartphone-happy pal from downloading too many apps and playing too many games in the bathroom, it's at least a good way to help him manage his phone's battery life and maybe shave a few minutes off of each charging session. Heck, maybe you'll save him enough time that he can find a better hobby.\n\nGet the Yootech X2 wireless charger from Amazon for $13.39\n\n9. For the man who loves meats: Masterbuilt propane smoker\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Masterbuilt propane smoker (Photo: Reviewed / Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nIf you know a guy who loves grilling and prepping meats, there's a good chance he already wants a smoker. A propane smoker like this one is how you make carnivore delicacies like pulled pork, Texas brisket, and baby back ribs like a pro. When we tested smokers, this Masterbuilt propane smoker took our award for best overall, eliciting an easy \"set it and forget it\" design that made it easy to smoke hocks of meat without constantly checking or adjusting propane levels. It can hold up to six turkeys, eight racks of ribs, or eight pork butts, so it's a great gift to give to whoever is hosting Thanksgiving next year, too.\n\nGet the Masterbuilt propane smoker from Amazon for $349.97\n\n10. For the high-tech console gamer: Xbox One X\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Microsoft Xbox One X (Photo: Reviewed / Lee Neikirk)\n\nWhen it comes to home video game consoles, Microsoft's super-powerful Xbox One X is the top of the heap where pure specs go. The ability to output games natively in 4K resolution, play HDR/Dolby Vision content, pass-thru Dolby Atmos sound, and process at speeds that put many PCs to shame make the Xbox One X as a stellar gift for any gamer looking for pure power. What's more, it's deeply backwards compatible, meaning it can play a few original Xbox titles and many Xbox 360 titles that your giftee may have bought in the past, and can even stream games to a Windows 10 laptop on the same network. Naturally, the One X also stands in as a DVD and 4K/HDR Blu-ray player, giving it some serious panache where home theater centerpieces are concerned.\n\nGet the Microsoft Xbox One X from Amazon for $417.98\n\n11. For the man who lives on the road: Otterbox Venture cooler\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Otterbox Venture cooler (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nYou guessed it\u2014we tested coolers too, and this Otterbox Venture was the best overall. If someone on your gift list spends a lot of time traveling, camping, hitting up the beach, or has been cursed with a hilariously tiny fridge, a spacious, durable cooler might be the perfect gift. To quote our Senior Lab Technician Jon Chan, \"You have a limited amount of leisure time, don\u2019t let a bad cooler ruin it.\" The Venture not only gives you a 45-quart capacity, it includes dry storage, a bottle opener, a lifetime warranty, and is allegedly \"bear resistant.\" Sayonara, Yogi.\n\nGet the Otterbox Venture cooler from Amazon for $349.99\n\n12. For the student: Acer Aspire E 15 laptop\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Acer Aspire E 15 (Photo: Reviewed / Brendan Nystedt)\n\nLet's face it: every student needs a good laptop for school. If you've got as giftee who just started college, graduate school, or even high school, we highly recommend the robust Acer Aspire E 15 laptop. Not only is it priced very reasonably, but it delivers a large 15.6-inch screen, an Intel Core i3 processor, and Windows 10. It's got enough power to run statistics software or photoshop (or video games), and the only real drawback is that it's a bit heavy if you're lugging it around all day. But hey, it wouldn't be school if you weren't rushing around with an overstuffed book bag, right?\n\nGet the Acer Aspire E 15 from Amazon for $374.90\n\n13. For the beer fanatic: Danby Contemporary Classic mini fridge\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Danby Contemporary Classic mini fridge (Photo: Reviewed)\n\nIf you know a guy who just can't seem to keep groceries stocked because his fridge is always stuffed with ales, porters, lagers, and (blech) IPAs, the time is ripe to buy that fellow a beer fridge. The Danby Contemporary Classic was one of our top-rated options when we tested beer fridges: available in a wide range of colors and offering a generous-enough-for-beer 4.4 cubit feet of space, the Danby could be perfect for Mr. Beer this holiday season. Its glass shelves give it a svelte aesthetic, and the locking door means you can safe-guard your beer from the thieving hands of thrifty friends, curious kids, and bold-nosed canines.\n\nGet the Danby Contemporary Classic mini fridge from Amazon for $248.99\n\n14. For the year-round griller: Cuisinart GR-150 griddler\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Cuisinsart Griddler (Photo: Reviewed / Sharon Franke)\n\nIf a guy on your gift list loves to grill but tends to close up shop when the leaves start turning and the air gets cold, you should use this holiday season to introduce him to the wonderful world of indoor, smokeless grilling. How? By gifting him the excellent Cuisinart GR-150 griddler, our top-rated indoor grill. What's more, this Cuisinart isn't just a grill: it stands in as a contact grill, panini press, full griddle, and even half grill/half griddle, if you wanna get fancy. It also uses an integrated drip tray and includes cleaning and scraping tools, ensuring you can pretty easily clean up whatever seared, greasy, delicious food you end up making.\n\nGet the Cuisinart GR-150 Griddler Deluxe from Amazon for $114.99\n\n15. For the binge-watcher: Roku Streaming Stick+\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Roku Streaming Stick Plus (Photo: Roku)\n\nIf you know a guy who loves bingeing TV shows (and who doesn't?), I'd bet dollars to donuts he'd love the Roku Streaming Stick+. This hyper-portable media streaming device has been one of our favorites for years, due to its fast playback, intuitive remote and interface, ability to stream 4K/HDR content, and friendly price. The stick plugs right into any HDMI port\u2014be it a TV, monitor, or even an HDMI-in on a laptop\u2014and you can easily jump right into Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Spotify, or whichever streaming service you want (provided you have an account/subscription fee and everything). Even if your giftee has a smart TV already, we'd bet the Roku Streaming Stick+ is faster, easier to use, and offers more apps.\n\nGet the Roku Streaming Stick+ from Amazon for $49.99\n\n16. For the man who dreams of flight: Potensic T25 GPS drone\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Potensic T25 drone (Photo: Reviewed / Adam Doud)\n\nOur top-rated drone under $200, the Potensic is proof that you don't have to give an arm and a leg to get a reliable, almost-professional-feeling drone. This GPS drone makes a great gift for any guy interested in aerial robotics, sweeping panoramic camera shots, or a younger giftee who just wants to cause some ruckus for the backyard birds. You're getting GPS, high stability, a 1080p camera, and variable speeds, all controllable via phone. Santa who? Fly your other presents down the chimney this year whenever you dang want to.\n\nGet the Potenstic T25 GPS drone from Amazon for $149.99\n\n17. For the guy who's a little anxious: Gravity Blanket\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: Gravity Blanket (Photo: Reviewed / Camryn Rabideau)\n\nWhile the new phenomenon of weighted blankets aren't scientifically proven to reduce anxiety, a heavy, comforting blanket and a little bit of placebo can go a long way. We'd know: we tested a bunch of weighted blankets, and found the Gravity Blanket to be perfectly weighted, luxurious, and comforting. If that's not enough, our tester also found that the Gravity Blanket was very easy to wash, something we found lacking amongst much of the competition. Even if a guy you're shopping for is just going through the rigmarole routine managing the day to day stresses of adulthood, settling in at night under a velvety-soft specialty blanket is enough to help anyone feel a little better.\n\nGet the Gravity Blanket (15 lb.) from Amazon for $249\n\n18. For the running man: Fitbit Charge 3 fitness tracker\n\nBest gifts for wives 2019: Fitbit Charge 3 (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf one of your gift hopefuls is a guy who likes to run all around all the time (or is even remotely interested in getting started or maintaining a fitness routine), the Fitbit Charge 3\u2014our top-rated fitness tracker\u2014is a hoppin' good gift idea. This fitness device tracks your heart rate, measures calorie burn, delivers a bevy of exercise modes, and can even track your sleep (to a degree that's a bit frightening). You can also use it kind of like a traditional smartwatch, getting notifications for calls, texts, weather alerts, and so on. Whether you just want to make sure you're sleeping well or are training for a 10k, the Charge 3 is here to playfully pat your butt and tell you to hit the showers.\n\nGet the Fitbit Charge 3 fitness tracker from Amazon for $139.99\n\n19. For the beach bum: JBL Flip 4 waterproof Bluetooth speaker\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: JBL Flip 4 (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nThe JBL Flip 4 has been our top-rated Bluetooth speaker in multiple categories, including the waterproof variety, so it's an awesome choice if you know a guy who wants to have a great-sounding source for music when he's out an about on the beach, at the pool, at the park, or really anywhere. This little speaker is robustly designed to withstand levels of dust, rain, and submersion, but it still puts out good volume and rich-sounding audio. It's also available in a metric heck ton of color options, making it easy to personalize it for your giftee. You can even get it in camouflage for that friend who claims to never lose anything, just to really put him to the test.\n\nGet the JBL Flip 4 waterproof Bluetooth speaker from Amazon for $89.95\n\n20. For the guy who loves good coffee: SterlingPro french press\n\nBest Christmas gifts for men: SterlingPro french press (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIt's well known that French Press coffee makers make some of the most flavorful and robustly caffeinated coffee around. There's really a whole culture around it: from selecting the right beans, to grinding them to the right size and adding water of the right temperature, French pressing is a rabbit hole your coffee-loving man may just want to hop down. This stainless steel press from SterlingPro took our top spot when we tested french presses, due to its double-walled design, snug filter fit, and the relatively unbreakable nature of its fully steel body. French presses take a little more prep and work than drip coffee, but doesn't everything that's worth anything in life?\n\nGet the SterlingPro stainless steel French press from Amazon for $35.98\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
