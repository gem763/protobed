According to a New York police spokesman, he was 75, and was discovered by police officers about 4 p.m. Sunday in response to a 911 call. The medical examiner\u2019s office announced on Monday that the cause was heart disease, and noted that he had pulmonary emphysema.\n\nInfluenced by classic rockers like Buddy Holly as well as more adventurous acts such as the Velvet Underground and Roxy Music, Mr. Ocasek bridged pop, new wave and hard rock when he and bassist-singer Benjamin Orr co-founded the Cars in Boston in 1976, joined by guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson.\n\nMr. Ocasek (pronounced oh-CASS-ek) wrote nearly all the band\u2019s hits and split vocal duties with Orr, with whom he had played in folk and rock groups for nearly a decade. Their last and most enduring collaboration, the Cars, \u201cdrove the fury and intellectual ad\u00adven\u00adture of punk rock out of the underground, firmly and forever into the American mainstream,\u201d according to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted the Cars last year.\n\nMixing disco-tinged synthesizer lines and catchy guitar riffs, the Cars emerged from the Boston club scene to become a fixture of MTV and a staple of classic rock and oldies radio stations for decades. Their 1978 self-titled debut, described by the website All Music as \u201ca genuine rock masterpiece,\u201d opened with three straight hit singles: \u201cGood Times Roll,\u201d \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl\u201d and \u201cJust What I Needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the perfume that you wear; it\u2019s not the ribbons in your hair,\u201d Orr sang in the latter, an icy, ambivalent love song typical of Mr. Ocasek\u2019s songwriting output. \u201cI don\u2019t mind you comin\u2019 here \u2014 and wastin\u2019 all my time.\u201d\n\n\n\nOcasek performs at the 9:30 Club in Washington in 2010. (Tracy A. Woodward/The Washington Post)\n\nThe album remained on the pop charts for more than a year, earned the Cars a Grammy nomination for best new artist and landed at No. 284 on a Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Polished like a classic hot rod \u2014 the work of English producer Roy Thomas Baker, known for collaborating with Queen \u2014 it helped popularize a new model of slick, radio-friendly guitar pop, and formed a sonic template used by the Cars for the next decade.\n\nThey reached the Top 10 four times, with the singles \u201cShake It Up,\u201d \u201cYou Might Think,\u201d \u201cDrive\u201d and \u201cTonight She Comes,\u201d peaking commercially with the 1984 album \u201cHeartbeat City.\u201d The record was anchored by \u201cDrive,\u201d a lyrically downcast ballad, sung by Orr, that marked the Cars\u2019 greatest international success and featured a music video starring model and actress Paulina Porizkova, whom Mr. Ocasek married in 1989.\n\nWhile the Cars\u2019 hits were \u201cingenious pop packages,\u201d New York Times music critic Jon Pareles wrote in 2011, \u201cbehind the songs were some left-field ideas, like the motoric Minimalism of bands like Kraftwerk and Suicide and the spooky possibilities of electronic music.\u201d Mr. Ocasek experimented further in the first of seven solo albums, \u201cBeatitude\u201d (1982) and in his work as a producer, stepping away from his songwriting and performance work to collaborate with acts as varied as Bad Brains, Guided by Voices, Hole, No Doubt, Iggy Pop and Weezer.\n\n\u201cI wanted bands to feel like they were going to get exactly what they wanted without anybody pushing them around,\u201d he told the Times in 2004, explaining why he stepped into a studio role. Known for mentoring aspiring artists, including during a stint in the early 2000s as a senior vice president at Elektra Records, he also cultivated a reputation as something of a control freak.\n\n\u201cRivers [Cuomo, the lead singer and songwriter for Weezer] gives me 60 songs and I go, \u2018I like these 10,\u2019 and he goes, \u2018I won\u2019t do any of those,\u2019 and I say, \u2018You must,\u2019 and he does them,\u201d Mr. Ocasek told the Boston Globe in 2003. Suicide singer Alan Vega described his collaboration with Mr. Ocasek in less acrimonious terms, telling the Times: \u201cWhen I work with him, I know I\u2019m in God\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\n\n\nOcasek during the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction show for the Cars in 2018. (Aaron Josefczyk/Reuters)\n\nMr. Ocasek was born Richard Otcasek in Baltimore on March 23, 1944, according to New York Police Department records. His family moved to Cleveland when he was a teenager, after his father got a job as a NASA computer analyst.\n\nMr. Ocasek said he was booted from sixth grade for \u201cgiving the nuns a hard time,\u201d and studied at the Ohio schools Antioch College and Bowling Green State University before dropping out. Music offered direction: After receiving a Sears guitar from his grandmother at 14, he began imitating Holly, inspired by the guitarist\u2019s 1957 song \u201cThat\u2019ll Be the Day.\u201d\n\nSupporting himself with jobs at U.S. Steel and a wallpaper company, he played alongside Orr in groups such as Milkwood \u2014 the band recorded one album, \u201cHow\u2019s the Weather\u201d (1972), which was largely ignored \u2014 before forming the Cars. As rockers in a disco era, the musicians \u201cfelt a bit like crusaders,\u201d Mr. Ocasek later told the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe band broke up in 1988 (in later interviews, the musicians cited exhaustion and burnout) and Orr died of pancreatic cancer in 2000. Mr. Ocasek declined to participate in a reunion group known as the New Cars, which featured singer Todd Rundgren, but rejoined his former bandmates for a subsequent tour and seventh studio album, \u201cMove Like This\u201d (2011).\n\nOver the decades, Mr. Ocasek continued to record as a solo artist, cracking the Top 20 with his 1986 love song \u201cEmotion in Motion\u201d and partnering with Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins for the 1997 album, \u201cTroublizing.\u201d He also portrayed a beatnik painter in director John Waters\u2019s movie musical \u201cHairspray\u201d (1988); published a 2012 collection of his writing, \u201cLyrics & Prose\u201d; and exhibited drawings, paintings, prints and photographs.\n\nHe had six sons, two from each of his three marriages, and in 2018 his third wife, Porizkova, announced that they had \u201cpeacefully separated.\u201d Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.\n\nIn a 1991 interview with the Tribune, Mr. Ocasek recalled that the Cars\u2019 band name was chosen because it signified something disposable, \u201cjust like Campbell\u2019s soup cans are disposable, and pop music for that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t hope some of the songs I write stay around,\u201d he added. \u201cI hear Muzak versions of \u2018Drive\u2019 at the dentist\u2019s office and in the elevator, so that song\u2019s here to stay. . . . Art is a distorted vision of reality that\u2019s presented to people who don\u2019t necessarily need it, but you\u2019d like to give it to them anyway. Songs are like that, too. People don\u2019t have to hear them, but you\u2019d like them to.\u201d", "description": "He co-founded the band and wrote pop-rock hits including \u201cGood Times Roll\u201d and \u201cDrive.\u201d", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VnjLGW5LNWY1R5JH7hn7Y6WbQxc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CGTYKGYTAI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
