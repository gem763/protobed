(Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Marilynn Flynn)\n\nWhy send one robot to explore a world when you can send a whole bunch all at once? Such is the thinking behind NASA\u2019s highly conceptual Shapeshifter \u2014 a modular, morphing, self-assembling robot capable of deploying several smaller machines.\n\nThe Shapeshifter concept is currently being developed as part of NASA\u2019s Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program, which encourages researchers to devise creative new ways of exploring distant words. The morphing bot is being designed and built at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab by roboticist Ali Agha and his collaborators from Stanford University and Cornell University, according to a NASA JPL press release.\n\nThis aerial amphibious robot is still in its embryonic stage of development, but should the concept prove feasible, the machine could be used to explore the dynamic environment on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan, the only object in the Solar System other than Earth to host a liquid at the surface \u2014 even if it is mucky, oil-like liquid methane.\n\nThe Shapeshifter prototype in its current form. (Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nSo far, the early tests of Shapeshifter look to be promising. Currently, the 3D-printed prototype can move by rolling around on the ground, but it can also split itself in half, with the upper portion taking flight in the form of an aerial drone.\n\nAgha and his colleagues say this is only the beginning. Eventually they\u2019ll equip the bot with components capable of swimming, floating and navigating through caves, among other possibilities.\n\nIndeed, such a contraption would be perfect for Titan, with its sprawling methane seas, flowing rivers and complex topography. Titan, in addition to hosting cave systems, could also contain icy volcanoes that erupt ammonia or water, according to NASA. Having a bot explore these features would be pretty incredible, to say the least.\n\n\u201cWe have very limited information about the composition of the surface. Rocky terrain, methane lakes, cryovolcanoes \u2014 we potentially have all of these, but we don\u2019t know for certain,\u201d said Agha in the NASA release. \u201cSo we thought about how to create a system that is versatile and capable of traversing different types of terrain but also compact enough to launch on a rocket.\u201d\n\nIn its idealised final form, Shapeshifter would be a morphing, modular, self-assembling robot comprised of smaller robots dubbed \u201ccobots\u201d. Every cobot would be equipped with a small propeller, allowing them to move independently of one another.\n\nThe cobots \u201ccould also go spelunking, forming a daisy chain to maintain contact with the surface,\u201d according to NASA. \u201cOr they could transform into a sphere to roll on flat surfaces and conserve energy.\u201d\n\nOnce on Titan\u2019s surface, the landing portion of the system, or \u201cmothercraft\u201d, in the words of Agha, would provide an energy source for its cobot army. The lander would also be equipped with various scientific instruments and tools.\n\nThe team estimates that 10 cobots would fit within a lander measuring about 3m wide \u2014 around the size of the Huygens lander, which visited Titan back in 2005. But unlike other landers, this one would be able to fly through the moon\u2019s dense atmosphere.\n\nIn its current form, Shapeshifter is semi-autonomous, requiring some human guidance. Eventually the bot will be fully self-reliant, which it\u2019s going to have to be given the complexities of exploring Titan, not to mention all its moving parts.\n\nHaving mission controllers fully operate the system from Earth would be super awkward, given that it takes over 70 minutes for signals to reach Titan.\n\nWill NASA Find Life On Titan?
