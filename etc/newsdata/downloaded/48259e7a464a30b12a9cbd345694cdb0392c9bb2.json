NEW: A video depicting a macabre scene of a fake President Trump shooting, stabbing & brutally assaulting members of the news media & his political opponents was shown at a conference for his supporters at his Miami resort @maggieNYT @nytmike scoop https://t.co/PdXLkcSYLO \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 14, 2019\n\n2. \"He strikes the late Arizona senator John McCain in the back of the neck. He hits the television personality Rosie O\u2019Donnell in the face and then stabs her in the head. He strikes Rep Maxine Waters. He lights the head of Senator Bernie Sanders on fire\"https://t.co/PdXLkcSYLO \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 14, 2019\n\n3. \"He takes Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, hostage before throwing him to the ground. Then he strikes former President Barack Obama in the back and throws him against a wall.\" https://t.co/PdXLkcSYLO \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 14, 2019\n\n4. \"The clip ends with Mr. Trump putting a stake into the head of a person with a CNN logo for a face. Mr. Trump then stands on the altar, admiring his rampage, and smiles.\" https://t.co/PdXLkcSYLO \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 14, 2019\n\nThe video is the infamous scene from the film, \u201cKingsman\u201d where the main characters is involved in a shootout inside a church, but the president\u2019s face is on the agent while media properties, etc., are photoshopped on the targets:\n\n5. As much as I hate to post this, given how much people are talking about this story, and that it involves the president's club, his supporters, and an organization that supports him, here's the video in question: pic.twitter.com/qqtllitsIP \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 14, 2019\n\nBut people started questioning the NYT report. Robby Soave from Reason:\n\nTwo questions about this not great piece: 1) The Times says they obtained the video. Why not publish it alongside the article and let us decide for ourselves? 2) Who showed it? Doesn't sound like it was the organizers. https://t.co/xvldRYgciJ \u2014 Robby Soave (@robbysoave) October 14, 2019\n\nReason\u2019s CJ Ciaramella was at the event and is adding some context to what and where it was shown. According to Ciaramella, the video was shown in an a \u201cmeme art exhibit\u201d:\n\nI was there. There was a room at the conference showing videos by that \u201ccarpe donktum\u201d guy. A meme art exhibit I guess. It was empty when I went in. I didn\u2019t see that specific video. \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nDid anyone at the conference actually see the video?\n\nI guess I missed this video in the \u201cart exhibit\u201d of memes at the pro-Trump conference this weekend. tbf I only stayed in the room a little bit because it was empty and weird. https://t.co/HjSkY2edIO \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s what the room looked like:\n\nHere\u2019s the room that video played in, for context https://t.co/bkm5ge3Xio \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nTo be very specific, it was in a side room at the Donald J. Trump ballroom at the Trump National Doral Miami. \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nAnd if you go back and watch the video, you can see the Kingsman meme on the little screen in the back:\n\nAh, you actually can see the Kingsman 2 video playing on the TV screen in the right corner towards the end of that clip, if you look carefully @maggieNYT \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nAccording to Ciaramella, the videos just played in that room on a loop:\n\nNo one! Just TVs and projectors on loop \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nJust for the record:\n\nAs member of the media, I do find memes about murdering the media to be in very poor taste. The president\u2019s resort is probably not a great venue for those, no. \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nIn no way whatsoever does that make it okay. \u2014 Rob Waldeck (@Robertwaldeck) October 14, 2019\n\nNot saying it was. The NYT didn\u2019t have some of the details, so just filling that in. \u2014 CJ Ciaramella (@cjciaramella) October 14, 2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s the source material:\n\n***", "description": "\"The NYT didn\u2019t have some of the details, so just filling that in.\"", "authors": ["Greg P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/New-Project-19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
