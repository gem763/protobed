REUTERS/Danish Ismail/File Photo\n\nNews of the fatality came as Pakistan warned that India was \u201csowing seeds of war\u201d in the Muslim-majority region that has long been a flashpoint between the nuclear-armed neighbours.\n\nIndia and Pakistan both rule parts of Kashmir while claiming it in full. They have fought two wars over the region and their forces regularly trade fire across a 740-km (466 mile) Line of Control, which is the de facto border.\n\nAsrar Ahmed Khan, 18, from the region\u2019s main city Srinagar, died on Tuesday night in hospital, succumbing to wounds he suffered a month ago, officials said.\n\n\u201cHe was reportedly injured with a blunt object in a law and order situation where a violent crowd was indulging in stone pelting,\u201d Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbag Singh told Reuters.\n\nSome protesters said Khan was hit by a tear gas canister, though authorities suspected a stone struck him, Singh said.\n\nMedia have reported at least two other deaths during protests, but authorities have denied that.\n\nIndia flooded the Kashmir valley with troops, restricted movements and cut off communication as Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew special rights for Kashmir on Aug. 5.\n\nIndian-controlled Kashmir lost its right to frame its own laws and non-residents were allowed to buy property there in changes the government said would help the region\u2019s development and bring it into line with the rest of the nation.\n\nMobile and internet connections have been off for 31 days.
