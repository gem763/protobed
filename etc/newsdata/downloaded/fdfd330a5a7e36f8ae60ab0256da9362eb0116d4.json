REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe inquiry announced Tuesday by Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi means that Trump could be the third president to face impeachment proceedings, after a whistleblower complaint accused him of seeking Ukraine\u2019s help to smear Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cHe is already promising that if he does it will be the biggest and most beautiful impeachment in history,\u201d ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel said in his monologue on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d late on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah on Comedy Central said, \u201cAfter two years of avoiding it, Trump may finally face articles of impeachment, which believe me he is not happy about.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impeachment which Trump hates, plus articles which he hates even more,\u201d Noah said in an apparent reference to Trump\u2019s disdain for journalists and his reputed aversion to reading, preferring television instead.\n\nTabloids in Trump\u2019s hometown of New York employed bold images and headlines to needle both the Republican president and Pelosi, who had for months resisted calls inside her party for Trump\u2019s impeachment..\n\n\u201cImpeaching to the Choir,\u201d the New York Post\u2019s front-page headline. In smaller lettering the newspaper mockingly asked, \u201cPelosi announces \u2018inquiry\u2019 - but isn\u2019t that what they\u2019ve already been doing?\u201d Various Trump activities are the subject of about a dozen ongoing congressional investigations as well as more than a dozen federal, state and local inquiries.\n\nAs controversy swirled over the whistleblower complaint, pro-Trump commentators also used humor to skewer former vice president Biden. Conservative commentator Glenn Beck on Monday said, \u201cThe first stop on Biden\u2019s corruption tour is Ukraine.\u201d\n\nNBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, host of \u201cLate Night,\u201d also ribbed Pelosi on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my doubts in the past but I think this time, she\u2019s serious,\u201d Meyers said as over his shoulder appeared a photograph of Pelosi with her face painted blue to threaten war, resembling actor Mel Gibson as a 13th century Scottish warrior in the 1995 film Braveheart.\n\nKimmel referenced both Pelosi\u2019s long-time reluctance to initiate an impeachment inquiry and accusations against Trump by more than a dozen women who said he made unwanted sexual advances against them before he entered politics. Trump has denied the accusations.\n\n\u201cOnce again, Donald Trump is doing what he does best \u2014 forcing a woman to do something she didn\u2019t want to do,\u201d Kimmel said in his monologue.", "description": "From late night television hosts to tabloid front pages, the congressional Democrats' impeachment inquiry of U.S. President Trump sparked a firestorm of jokes and quips.", "authors": ["Barbara Goldberg", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433854428&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1R8-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
