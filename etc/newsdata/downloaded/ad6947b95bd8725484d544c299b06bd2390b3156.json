Eamon Gallagher\n\n\"The strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling and we continue to be confident in the significant benefits it will deliver,\" Mr Mota said.\n\n\"The transaction will meaningfully increase the scale and footprint of our core business.\"\n\nMr Mota said the $125 million in savings from the original $975 million purchase price would be used to reduce debt.\n\n\u201cWe were relying on borrowing to finance the original price, so the most immediate impact of the new terms is to borrow less which also provides us with some strategic options going forward,\u201d Mr Mota said.\n\nIOOF shares soared following the announcement, trading 9 per cent higher in early trade while ANZ shares edged up 0.4 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe prospect of a discount to the billion dollar price tag agreed to more than a year ago has been floated by a number of analysts after a series of firesales in the wealth management sector.\n\nThe 12.8 per cent reduction in the headline price sees the multiple paid by IOOF for the business fall to 13.5 times from 15.5 times.\n\nUnder the new terms the reduced price contributes to a lower warranty cap which allows IOOF to revert back to ANZ if any issues are discovered following the integration of the business.\n\nA clause that would see ANZ and IOOF commit to a minimum 20 year period of working together has also been removed however Mr Mota stressed this did not preclude the two parties from collaborating but merely provided flexibility.\n\nThe transaction was placed in limbo after the prudential regulator attempted to have five IOOF directors and executives including then chairman George Vernados and former CEO Chris Kelaher banned from the superannuation industry.\n\nThe regualtor lost the case after Justice Jayne Jagot dismissed the claims as \"unpersuasive\" adding to a series of high profile court defeats suffered by the regulators in the aftermath of the Hayne royal commission.", "description": "Bank sells wealth arm after cutting the multiple to 13.5 times from 15.5 times and gaining approval from the trustee.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/63a9befa024c274b83c73e870852326bcc90646a", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
