They said: 'It's a crime scene, you can't come out',\" said the woman, who declined to give her name.\n\nPolice said the man was acting alone.", "description": "The stabbing incident in Sydney brought the central business district in Australia's largest city to a standstill in the early afternoon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106075451-1565676304202gettyimages-1161449825.jpeg?v=1565676389"}
