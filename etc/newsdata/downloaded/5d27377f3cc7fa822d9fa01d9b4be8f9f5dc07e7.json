You Also Get Paid Leave.", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON \u2014 A British broadcaster is prioritizing women\u2019s health by rolling out a raft of measures to aid those dealing with a subject that is rarely discussed freely and openly in the workplace: menopause.\n\nChannel 4, a national television station in Britain, announced Friday that it would offer its female employees flexible working arrangements, tailored work spaces and even paid leave if they experienced menopause symptoms.\n\nCommon symptoms include hot flashes, heavy periods, low mood, increased anxiety, difficulty sleeping, joint pain, and problems with memory and concentration often referred to as \u201cbrain fog.\u201d They can persist for years and are both physical and psychological, and about 80% of women will experience them in some form, according to the British National Health Service.\n\nMenopause \u2014 a natural part of aging that is caused by a drop in the production of estrogen \u2014 typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55.\n\n\u201cThis is Channel 4 living its remit, normalizing a taboo subject by making it more visible,\u201d Channel 4\u2019s chief executive, Alex Mahon, said in a statement.\n\nMahon, the first woman to be chief executive in Channel 4\u2019s 37-year history, added that she hoped the policy would inspire other media companies to support women in their workplaces going through menopause.\n\nThe broadcaster says that its menopause initiative \u2014 pioneered by an in-house gender equality staff network \u2014 is the first known among British media companies.\n\nWhile some workplaces have introduced lactation rooms for breastfeeding mothers and free period products in bathrooms, they have been slow to accommodate or recognize the battles that older women face during menopause.\n\nDr. Philippa Kaye, a London-based physician and author of \u201cThe M Word: Everything You Need to Know About the Menopause,\u201d said that more companies needed to take action.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant brain drain that could happen,\u201d Kaye said. \u201cWomen worry that they will be considered \u2018past it\u2019 or sidelined if they speak up about their symptoms. Businesses should be talking about menopause so that women do not feel so uncomfortable about it.\u201d\n\nThe broadcaster\u2019s announcement was rolled out on World Menopause Day, created by the International Menopause Society.\n\nAlthough research has found that many women believe that menopause affects their work negatively, a study from the University of Nottingham found that they are loath to speak up about its impact and are frequently embarrassed to disclose the reason they could be underperforming or missing work altogether.\n\nTo combat hot flashes, a private and cool space has been set aside at Channel 4\u2019s offices, and women will be entitled to an assessment to ensure that their work spaces do not make their symptoms worse.\n\nA human resources employee has been designated as the \u201cMenopause Champion,\u201d and the broadcaster said it would introduce briefings to raise awareness of menopause within its leadership.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that not just women themselves, but that all members of staff, are aware of menopause symptoms and have access to information to make work environments more supportive places for women in menopause,\u201d Sarah Francis, a spokeswoman for the British women\u2019s health charity Wellbeing of Women, said in a statement about Channel 4\u2019s initiative.\n\nReaction on social media to the initiative was overwhelmingly positive, even prompting one Twitter user to suggest \u201cLet\u2019s all go and work at Channel 4.\u201d\n\nWhile the broadcaster joins only a handful of other British companies in offering menopause support, a number of businesses worldwide are striving to improve their female workers\u2019 experiences.\n\nSome offer \u201cmenstrual leave\u201d policies, which allow women to take a paid day off menstruating, and others provide backup day care benefits for working parents whose arrangements fall through.\n\nAlthough Channel 4 has taken steps to tackle what has been coined the \u201cgender pain gap,\u201d the more widely talked-about gender pay gap remains a persistent problem. The British broadcaster reported a 28% mean average pay gap in 2018.\n\nThe television channel isn\u2019t the only employer that has struggled to close the gap in paying men and women equally.\n\nAfter Britain made it compulsory for businesses with at least 250 employees to report the difference between average salaries and bonuses for male and female staff members, a report showed a majority were still paying men more than women.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "LONDON -- A British broadcaster is prioritizing women's health by rolling out a raft of measures to aid those dealing with a subject that is rarely discussed freely and openly in the workplace: menopause.Channel 4, a national television station in Britain, announced Friday that it would offer its", "authors": ["Anna Schaverien"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
