With its boxy design, the three-row Flex drew a devoted following while provoking snickering from people who disliked the vehicle's unusual shape.\n\n\"People who own the Flex love it, but it became almost a cult vehicle and the numbers were just too small,\" said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at car-buying site Autotrader.\n\nThe move comes as Ford is betting big on other, newer SUVs like the forthcoming revival of the Bronco and an electric crossover inspired by the Mustang.\n\nThe company is also paring down its vehicle lineup to excise poor performers, including most of its passenger cars. Gone are the Fiesta and Taurus, for example.\n\nThe Flex's demise has been long rumored. Officials at Unifor, the Canadian auto workers union, said in late 2016 that Ford would discontinue the Flex in 2020. The vehicle is built at the company's plant in Oakville, Ontario, where it also makes the more-popular Ford Edge and Lincoln Nautilus.\n\nThe 2019 model will be the last version of the Flex. The automaker has sold more than 296,000 units of the vehicle since its debut.\n\nThe Flex \"dared to be bold\" when it was introduced, Ford said in a statement. \"It gained a loyal following as a stylish, roomy wagon blending sport/utility vehicle and minivan capability in a low-slung retro-inspired package.\"\n\nLuxury glass:Coming to a new car or truck near you\n\nThese vehicles are being killed in 2019:Say goodbye to Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan cars\n\nFord said the decision to kill the Flex grew out of its \"plan to strengthen its focus on products in the heart of the fastest-growing segments.\"\n\nThe company is laying off 450 workers at the Oakville plant as a result of the decision, trade journal Automotive News reported.\n\nPart of the challenge for the Flex was a surge in competition. Foreign automakers have debuted several three-row SUVs over the last few years, including the Volkswagen Atlas, the Kia Telluride and the Hyundai Palisade.\n\n\"There's so much competition, you're going to see vicious battles,\" Krebs said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "description": "Ford is killing off the Ford Flex sport-utility vehicle as the automaker continues to overhaul its lineup to maximize its focus on hot sellers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/04/12/USAT/6d3c9a8a-0692-4ff6-ac69-8e5d150844a2-2019_Ford_Flex.jpg?crop=1279,719,x0,y84&width=1091&height=719&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
