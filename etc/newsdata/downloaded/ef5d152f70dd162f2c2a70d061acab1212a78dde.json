REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nThe collapse of construction company Carillion and retailer BHS has fueled calls from Britain\u2019s parliament for a shakeup of the audit market to spot problems earlier and avoid thousands of employees losing their jobs.\n\nBritain\u2019s accounting regulator this week began investigating EY\u2019s audit of travel company Thomas Cook, which collapsed last month.\n\nDonald Brydon, former London Stock Exchange chairman, has been asked by Britain\u2019s business ministry to look at how to improve the quality and effectiveness of the audit market.\n\nBrydon said it was not auditors that cause companies to fail, but the actions of directors.\n\n\u201cAnd I am a little troubled by the current mood that reaches for a shotgun aimed at auditors every time there is a corporate problem,\u201d he told an audience at the ICAEW, a professional accounting body.\n\n\u201cI am mindful that audit needs to be an attractive profession that attracts the brightest and best who can have confidence that good professional work will not be misdescribed at moments of stress,\u201d Brydon said.\n\nBrydon will make recommendations by the end of the year on what can be done about the gap between what investors want from an audit and what accountants can deliver.\n\nBrydon said 2,500 pages of submissions to his review were strongly of the view that change is needed, though he stressed that he would not be \u201credesigning Western capitalism\u201d.\n\nThere are frustrations with what people see as the currently \u201cnarrow, backward-looking and increasingly rules-obsessed approach to audit\u201d and wanted more forward-looking aspects of a company covered as well.\n\n\u201cI do believe that in seeking to improve the impact and quality of audit, we must look not just to auditors, but to audit committees, boards and managements too,\u201d Brydon said.\n\nThe government has yet to say to what extent it will implement two other reviews in the past year that recommended creating a more powerful regulator, and requiring big companies to hire two auditors and separate their consulting and audit operations.\n\nMany of the recommendations need legislation at a time when parliament is consumed with Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.", "description": "Auditors are being blamed too much when a company collapses rather than actions taken by company directors, the head of an inquiry into Britain's audit sector said on Friday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436952748&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930LS", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
