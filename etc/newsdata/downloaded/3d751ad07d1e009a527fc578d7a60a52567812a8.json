Another 13 percent of voters are undecided.\n\nOnline interviews for the latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll began Tuesday night, after Pelosi\u2019s announcement, and ran through early Thursday, with nearly all interviews conducted prior to the public release of a complaint from a whistleblower concerned about Trump\u2019s conduct in dealing with Ukraine.\n\nSupport for impeachment is up 7 points from the previous poll, which was conducted last Friday through Sunday. In that survey, only 36 percent of voters supported starting impeachment proceedings, while 49 percent opposed them.\n\nAmong Democratic voters, support for impeachment proceedings has increased 13 points, from 66 percent in the previous poll, to 79 percent now.\n\nBut, according to Morning Consult vice president Tyler Sinclair, support has also ticked up among other voters.\n\n\u201cAs more information has emerged about whistleblower allegations against President Trump, support for impeachment proceedings has grown to its highest point since the beginning of the summer,\u201d Sinclair said. \u201cThis week\u2019s news cycle had a significant impact on Republicans and independents, giving credibility to Democrats' impeachment inquiry. Up from 5 percent last week, 10 percent of Republicans now support beginning impeachment proceedings, while support among independents has reached 39 percent.\u201d\n\nThe new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll surveyed 1,640 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nPolls conducted in the midst of fast-moving news events may contain other sources of error, including the past observed phenomenon of voters who don\u2019t respond when negative stories are swirling about political figures they support.\n\nSome voters also may not be familiar with the latest developments in the Ukraine story. Only 32 percent of voters surveyed in the new poll say they\u2019ve heard \u201ca lot\u201d about news reports that Trump told senior administration officials to withhold military aid to Ukraine, days before he pressured the country\u2019s president to investigate what he casts as corrupt behavior by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked with a Ukrainian natural gas company. (There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden, who is running for president against Trump.)\n\nAnother 34 percent say they\u2019ve heard \u201csome\u201d about the Ukraine story \u2014 but a combined 34 percent say they haven\u2019t heard much or anything at all about it.\n\nAnd the story itself changed while the POLITICO/Morning Consult poll was in the field. After interviews began Tuesday evening, the White House released a memorandum of a phone conversation between Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, on Wednesday morning.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, testified on national TV before the House intelligence committee. But nearly all the interviews for the new poll were conducted prior to Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\nMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics, policy and business strategy.\n\nMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these two documents: Toplines: https://politi.co/2mX0jRo | Crosstabs: https://politi.co/2mYPVsj", "description": "American voters are now evenly split on whether the president should be impeached.", "authors": ["Steven Shepard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1177283811-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
