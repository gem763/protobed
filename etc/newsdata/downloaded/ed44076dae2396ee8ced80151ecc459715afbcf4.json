But the congresswoman's endorsement was also eagerly sought by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is now leading in national surveys of Democratic primary voters.\n\nSanders also received the backing of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, another high-profile progressive lawmaker, following Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate.\n\n\"Bernie is leading a working class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity, and geography,\" the Minnesota Democrat said in a statement late Tuesday evening.\n\n\"That is why he is fighting to cancel all student debt. That is why he is fighting to make all school meals universal. That is why he is fighting for a humane immigration policy that treats immigrants as human beings and not criminals. And it's why Bernie is fighting to end our forever wars and truly prioritize human rights in our foreign policy\u2013no matter who violates them. And it's why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020.\"\n\nSanders teased plans for a rally on Saturday in New York during Tuesday's debate in Ohio, when the senator was asked about his health in the wake of a heart attack two weeks ago.\n\nA spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez didn't immediately return requests for comment.", "description": "Congresswoman Ilhan Omar also endorsed the Vermont senator Tuesday night", "authors": ["Ed O'Keefe", "Victoria Albert"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/16/ffffcd32-b663-47da-adb6-09893866b678/thumbnail/1200x630/4cf8783698935df921a7e450c3ef8805/gettyimages-1151703169.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
