For most of us, the holidays means spending more time with family and friends, eating delicious food or going on vacation. But for criminals, this time signals the opportunity to break into homes. Don\u2019t let the anticipation of a well-deserved holiday blind you to the risks of leaving your home unprotected. Take precautions before you leave as it will help keep your home and belongings secure while you\u2019re gone, so you won\u2019t have to worry about security once you\u2019re on the road to fun and adventure.\n\nAlert your alarm company\n\nMake sure that your alarm is working by having it tested at least a week before you go away. Jarred Horn of Fidelity ADT advises: \u201cTell your security company that you\u2019re going away (if you\u2019re going away for more than a day or two) and inform them if anyone will be staying at your property \u2013 such as a family member, a house-sitter or a domestic worker.\u201d\n\nGive the illusion of activity\n\nInstall sensor lights at exit points of the house that will go on as soon as there\u2019s movement on your property. It\u2019s also wise to install timers on some of these lights so they\u2019ll switch on automatically at night. This creates the illusion of occupancy.\n\nHorn recommends that you ask a trusted friend to switch on lights, the TV or radios to create the typical noise and light of a regular family night. \u201cTry to make it seem as if someone is home. Ask a friend to open and close curtains at appropriate times, switch lights on or off, or leave the TV on only at night. Nothing says, \u2018We\u2019re not home\u2019 more than lights left on during the day or curtains closed.\u201d\n\nHold your mail\n\nA huge pile of mail on the front doorstep is an obvious tip-off that no one is home. If you\u2019ll be gone for more than a few days, go to the post office to place a hold on your mail and on your daily newspaper. Alternatively, Horn advises that you ask a trusted neighbour to empty your mail every day. \u201cThis includes removing post or any other items, like pamphlets, that accumulate while you\u2019re away.\u201d\n\nGet a house-sitter\n\nThe best solution to keeping your home safe while you\u2019re away is getting a trusted house- or pet-sitter. Pet-sitters will ensure that your animals are well taken care of because leaving your dog without food, water, company and love is not only cruel, it can cause the poor animal to whine and bark, which will invite criminals. \u201cIf you have pets, get someone to look after them and leave enough food and water in the house,\u201d says Horn. \u201cOr, if you can afford it, house your pets at a kennel or cattery while you\u2019re away.\u201d\n\nDo a security check\n\nLock all doors, burglar bars and windows. Sometimes people leave an access route open for their pets, but this allows criminals to get in a lot more easily than if the house is locked up. \u201cCheck for ways to enter your home.\u201d says Horn. \u201cCan criminals use the dustbin to reach the second storey window that\u2019s open? Are items lying around that can be used to break into your home, such as a hosepipe or garden tools? Keep these locked away and out of sight.\u201d A common entry point for burglars is to break in through an unlocked door or window, or to kick down the door. This is another reason to install burglar bars on your doors and windows.\n\nSource: W24\n\nBack to homepage.", "description": "", "authors": ["True Love Via"], "top_image": "https://myhome.24.com/5-ways-to-keep-your-home-safe-while-you-re-away-on-holiday/assets/YopoBFMnTA/istock-526141412-2121x1414.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
