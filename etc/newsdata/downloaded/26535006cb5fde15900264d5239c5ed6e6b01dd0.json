Cash Crisis Sees Water Coolers Empty, Meetings and Travel Slashed", "language": "en", "text": "The United Nations has begun a series of cut backs at its New York headquarters, starting with the heating being turned down, the diplomats\u2019 bar shuttering early at 5pm and meetings canceled along with diminished first class global travel budgets.\n\nThe cause of the tightening purse strings is simple.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the globalist organization is running a deficit of $230 million. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned it may run out of money by the end of October unless world governments and their taxpayers immediately lift financial contributions.\n\nUntil then, there will be a restriction in operations for an organization often criticized as a debating society for the elites incapable of reform. It is bloated, undemocratic \u2013 and very expensive, as any number of U.S. critics from President Donald Trump down have noted.\n\n\u201cWe really have no choice,\u201d said Catherine Pollard, a top official in the UN\u2019s management department, in explaining the operational pause.\n\nIn a letter to 37,000 fulltime employees, a copy of which was seen by AFP, Guterres laid out the looming cutbacks he said would mean fewer flights and receptions, limits on hiring, fewer documents, reports and translations and even an end to water coolers.\n\nGuterres called the crunch the \u201cworst cash crisis facing the United Nations in nearly a decade.\u201d\n\nHe warned the organization, \u201cruns the risk of depleting its liquidity reserves by the end of the month and defaulting on payments to staff and vendors.\u201d\n\nThe United States is by far the U.N.\u2019s biggest financial contributor, stumping up 22 percent of its operating budget and funding 28 percent of peacekeeping missions, which currently cost $8 billion annually.\n\nThe UK and Germany are the next two major backers.\n\nPresident Trump has long pushed its reform and just last week said the \u201cfuture does not belong to globalists\u201d in a warning to the organization\u2019s leaders, adding, \u201cthe future belongs to patriots, the future belongs to sovereign and independent nations.\u201d\n\nResponding to reports of deep U.N. budget deficits, Trump showed little sympathy for its inability to manage its own budget.\n\n\u201cSo make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States!\u201d he wrote Wednesday.\n\nSo make all Member Countries pay, not just the United States! https://t.co/IVbE4MqBVl \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nIn December 2017 Nikki Haley, the then United States Ambassador to the organization, announced the federal government had reduced its contribution to the U.N.\u2019s annual budget by $285 million, as Breitbart News reported.\n\nHaley\u2019s statement came after the U.N. voted to condemn the United States for Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The resolution, backed by nations with long records of extreme human rights abuses, passed 128-9. Haley immediately responded by threatening to reduce America\u2019s U.N. funding.\n\n\u201cThe United States will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,\u201d Haley told the assembly in New York City.\n\n\u201cWe will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world\u2019s largest contribution to the United Nations and we will remember it when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Trump has seen the U.S. cut funding to UNESCO, the U.N. Population Fund, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency.\n\nHe has cited the U.N.\u2019s numbing bureaucracy, its institutional cover-ups of corruption and the undemocratic politics of its security council as just a few examples of its manifest failures, so much of which has been funded by U.S. taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThe United States is the world\u2019s largest giver in the world, by far, of foreign aid. But few give anything to us,\u201d Trump said in September last year.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends. And we expect other countries to pay their fair share for the cost of their defense.\u201d", "description": "A cash crisis at the U.N. has seen cut backs at its New York headquarters, starting with\u00a0the heating being turned down.", "authors": ["Simon Kent"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/drinks-with-Antonio-Guterres-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
