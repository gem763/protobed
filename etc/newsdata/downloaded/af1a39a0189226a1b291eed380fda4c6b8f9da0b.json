He said that GM would build 60,000 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrids in 2012. In fact, GM only sold 24,361 Volts in the United States that year, proving that it was awfully difficult to predict sales of plug-in vehicles at the start of the modern EV era.\n\n\n\nThat history isn\u2019t stopping GM's current CEO, Mary Barra, from making her own bold prediction about her company's EV plans. She didn't say exactly when\u2014other than sometime in the near future\u2014but she told Bloomberg News that she expects GM is going to sell a million electric vehicles a year globally, saying, \"This is what we really believe is the future of transportation.\"\n\nTruth be told, that\u2019s not a good number if GM were to do that with today's realities, since each sale of the all-electric Bolt EV has been said to lose $7000 to $9000. But with decades of battery research under its belt, declining battery costs, and ever more stringent emissions regulations around the world that will make fossil-fuel vehicles more expensive, the cost calculations are changing. The company has developed at least 18 different prototypes ranging from sedans to autonomous vehicles to SUVs and sports cars on the same skateboard-style platform. These could make up the next onslaught of GM EVs. GM president Mark Reuss says that Barra's million-EVs-a-year target will let the company make a profit.\n\nThe biggest factor will be the change in the cost of batteries. When the Volt came out in 2010, general estimates had the cost per kilowatt-hour of a pack at more than $1000. Industry analysts now estimate that cost to be around or just under $200 today, with estimates of just $50 per kWh being talked about for 2025. Reuss, cited by Bloomberg, said that once the cost gets to $100 per kWh, that's where GM can make money selling all-electric vehicles. Think back to late 2017, when GM said it would introduce at least 20 new EVs by 2023, and the picture starts to become more clear for how GM can get to a million EVs a year, with a strong focus on sales in China.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Barry believes General Motors can expand beyond the Chevy Bolt to a full, big-selling EV lineup.", "authors": ["Sebastian Blanco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PwOryPwu7qqw5nQg_St8_Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/6a61b5e2e1ca55a6b2800b297f9db9d9", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
