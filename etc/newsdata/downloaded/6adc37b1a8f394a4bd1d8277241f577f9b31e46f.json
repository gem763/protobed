The healthy dogs jump and bark loudly, pushing their cold, wet noses between the bars of their cages in sterile, white rooms. The sick dogs are quiet.\n\nTheir location is a secret. University officials told The Dallas Morning News the strict confidentiality shields the dogs and their caretakers from overzealous activists.\n\nBut animal welfare groups say the dogs are the ones who need protection from the university.\n\nThe dogs live on campus because researchers at Texas A&M; use them to study Duchenne muscular dystrophy - a degenerative disease that\u2019s terminal for mostly young boys. University scientists are seeking a cure, or at least a meaningful treatment to lengthen lives.\n\nA similar version of the disease naturally occurs in golden retrievers, one of America\u2019s most beloved breeds. Since 2012, Texas A&M; has quietly become a world leader on Duchenne animal research. But it\u2019s required the university to breed sick dogs - and sometimes euthanize them - in the name of science.\n\nIt\u2019s a controversial means to an end at a time when medical research on dogs and cats is declining. The laboratory attracts a steady stream of protests, harassment and the occasional death threat from activists desperate to shut it down.\n\nBut Texas A&M; officials are undeterred, motivated by their mission to save human lives.\n\n\u201cWhat this is is a philosophical divide among those who do not believe in any animal research and those of us who devote our lives to animals, and realize that at this point animal research is still necessary,\u201d said Dr. Eleanor Green, dean of the Texas A&M; School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. \u201cOne day, maybe we won\u2019t need it. And it\u2019s becoming less and less, but until that day comes, we believe it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nA secret lab\n\nFor seven years, the university has cloaked the laboratory in secrecy, denying visitors, rejecting media interview requests, and in some cases, misrepresenting how researchers obtained the dogs for their studies.\n\nOfficials last month granted The Dallas Morning News limited access to the dog colony and lab, but banned a reporter from taking any photos or video.\n\nMost important, researchers and vet school officials want the public to know the dogs are treated with great care.\n\n\u201cThese animals are loved from the minute they enter this world to the minute they leave it,\u201d Green said.\n\nSchool officials also want people to know they\u2019re doing the work with human lives in mind - like Kyle Cox, a 23-year-old graduate student with Duchenne.\n\nDuchenne will kill 1 in 3,500 young boys, tearing slowly away at their muscles and rendering them wheelchair bound by the time they\u2019re 15. Most people born with the disease will die before they reach their 30s.\n\nIn dogs, the disease similarly breaks down muscles. They get tired easily, lose their ability to walk and have trouble swallowing food. They\u2019ll live to be about 7 to 9 years old.\n\nIn 2012, Dr. Joseph Kornegay, who is considered the father of this line of canine research, was recruited to join Texas A&M;\u2019s distinguished veterinary school.\n\nHe brought with him more than 70 golden retrievers to start the school\u2019s research colony.\n\nIn the building where the dogs live, only a couple of the canines had beds or toys, out of a worry that they will tear them up and ingest the fabric. At least one of the dogs had thick saliva dripping out of its mouth - a symptom of the disease.\n\nWith names like Jumba and Bruno, the dogs take turns throughout the day playing outside in a gated, grassy area. On hot days, they\u2019re allowed to splash around in a plastic kiddie pool.\n\nThere are roughly 40 dogs on campus, down from about 100. Purebred golden retrievers comprised the original group of dogs, but gradually researchers bred them with Labradors and beagle mixes to diversify the colony. About half have the muscle disease - the other half are either genetic carriers used for breeding, or they\u2019re unaffected dogs born into the lab that are waiting to be adopted.\n\nThe operation is being scaled down as a result of Kornegay\u2019s retirement in June and the expiration of many of the grants tied to his work. The university will no longer breed the dogs onsite, instead getting them from other research partners.\n\nResearchers insist the sick dogs aren\u2019t living in pain, they\u2019re just weaker. When the dogs are subjected to muscle strength tests, or when a one-centimeter cubed piece of muscle is surgically biopsied, they\u2019re anesthetized and given painkillers to recover.\n\nSome of the Duchenne dogs will participate in studies that require them to be euthanized when they\u2019re only 6 months old so their tissues can be examined.\n\nThe price of medicine\n\nScientists say animal testing is the uncomfortable price of medical advancement.\n\n\u201cEarly on in my research, I had to come to terms with the apparent disconnect between loving and caring for dogs and conducting research on them,\u201d Kornegay, who studied Duchenne in dogs for 46 years, said in an emailed statement. \u201cI have frequently attended meetings that have included parents of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and met the boys and young men with the disease. As a parent, I have been compelled to do whatever I could to give them hope and make their lives better.\u201d\n\nTexas A&M; officials say they\u2019ve achieved a significant milestone. Their research contributed to a gene therapy for Duchenne that was green lit last year for human clinical trials - a key step before medicine can become available to the public. However, the vast majority of therapies that make it to human clinical trials are never approved by the FDA.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge breakthrough,\u201d Green said. \u201cYou don\u2019t go to human clinical trials until you\u2019ve shown that they work in animals.\u201d\n\nVaccines, pacemakers, hip replacements, heart medicine and cancer therapies were all tested on animals. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires animal testing, including the use of a large animal, for therapies before they can be used on humans.\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s a cost to animals, but there\u2019s also a really significant cost to humans if you don\u2019t do this,\u201d said Jim Newman, a spokesman for Americans for Medical Progress. \u201cIf you step back and look at the big picture, there\u2019s a huge number of people who are depending on it.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, companion animals are being used in testing less frequently. Dogs make up less than half of 1% of the animals used in medical research today. In 2015, about 60,000 dogs were used as part of research or drug testing, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture - a drop of 71% since 1979.\n\nMatthew Brown, director of the Center for Values in Medicine, Science and Technology at the University of Texas at Dallas, said scientists who use animals for research are being asked to consider less intelligent subjects like fish, mice and insects when possible, which has led to the decline in dogs and chimpanzees in research.\n\n\u201cWith companion animals, they\u2019re more intelligent, they have more emotionally rich experiences, they have more social and emotional intelligence,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd with dogs in particular, we have purposely bred dogs to be social with humans, to be instinctually trusting of human beings. That\u2019s not ethically insignificant.\u201d\n\nA war with PETA\n\nThe university\u2019s work went largely under the radar for years. But in December 2016, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals declared war on Texas A&M; for it. The group released a video of the laboratory alleging that dogs were being tortured.\n\nThey showed dogs with ropes of saliva coming from their mouths, and another dog sloppily eating loose wet food they called \u201cgruel\u201d - however, university researchers said, it\u2019s commercial-grade food thinned with water to help the dogs eat it.\n\nThe negative attention from activists has caused the school to close itself off to the world, said Dr. Robert Rose, who oversees animal and teaching programs at Texas A&M.;\n\n\u201cDo we want to get into this public debate? Or are we more interested in curing diseases?\u201d he asked.\n\nFor almost three years, animal rights activists have spotlighted the dog colony, using celebrities including Paul McCartney to pressure the school to shut down the labs.\n\nPETA and other animal activists regularly protest on campus and at fundraisers and board meetings. They picket outside school officials\u2019 homes and send robocalls to students and faculty. They disrupted a graduation and routinely ambush Texas A&M;\u2019s social media, overtaking threads meant to recruit and welcome students.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had death threats. We get a lot of angry language that comes through over emails,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s all scary and it\u2019s all interruptive.\u201d\n\nTexas A&M; has responded to several media stories about PETA\u2019s latest publicity campaign by denying any cruelty. But they\u2019ve also erroneously denied that they were breeding dogs for research.\n\nSchool officials told several media organizations across the state and country that the dogs used in research were \u201calready affected\u201d with Duchenne and \u201cnot artificially made to be sick.\u201d\n\nAnd for at least two years, the school said on its website that the dogs \u201care already affected by this disease.\u201d The page was taken down in June after The News inquired about the inaccuracy.\n\nAccording to breeding records obtained in a public record request, at least 21 litters, or more than 100 puppies, have been bred at Texas A&M; since 2015.\n\n\u201cWhat they did was the smartest thing a university in their position could do, to misrepresent and lie to get the public on their side,\u201d said Alka Chandna, PETA vice president of laboratory investigations, speculating on their intentions. \u201cThere is no defense for what they\u2019re doing - taking golden retrievers to create a whole colony of sick dogs.\u201d\n\nGreen said the school is not intentionally trying to be dishonest.\n\n\u201cWe certainly want the truth out always, we have never tried to hide the fact that we were breeding the dogs,\u201d she said, adding that any misinformation was the result of a mistake \u201cinnocently done\u201d by a former vet school spokesperson.\n\nBut the answer isn\u2019t clear to students and alumni, who often are seen defending Texas A&M;\u2019s research from PETA on social media by accusing them of lying about the breeding.\n\n\u201cOh, honey, who hurt you? You really think a highly respected school would do this? Not to mention, have you seen this with your own eyes?\u201d wrote a student at Texas A&M; in 2018 in response to tweets about the Duchenne breeding.\n\n\u201cThey do not breed them. You\u2019re getting fake facts,\u201d tweeted another person trying to defend the university\u2019s lab.\n\nHope for Kyle\n\nFor Kyle Cox and his family, the researchers - and the dogs - are heroes. Cox was diagnosed with Duchenne as a young boy and doctors say he probably won\u2019t live to be 30.\n\nCox has been in a wheelchair since he was 11. His lungs are operating at 25% capacity. Recently, he\u2019s lost strength and mobility in his arms to the point that he can\u2019t lift a glass of water, and he can\u2019t get his arms around his mother\u2019s shoulders when she lifts him from his wheelchair.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hard. You want a hug from your boy, ya know?\u201d said his mom, Kristen Cox.\n\nHe came to College Station not because of the dog lab, but because he always wanted to be an Aggie. His family learned that the school did Duchenne research only when Kyle Cox was a junior. Kristen Cox immediately asked to meet with its team.\n\n\u201cIt really hit me in that moment,\u201d Kristen Cox said about when she met the room full of researchers. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to save my son\u2019s life, and they\u2019re doing it at some risk to themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Coxes are training a healthy golden retriever named Abby from the laboratory to be a service dog like Kyle Cox\u2019s golden retriever, Amber. Now Kristen helps connect more of the healthy dogs from the lab to Duchenne families, who have come from across the country to adopt the dogs.\n\nFrom time to time, the Coxes will try to reason with animal groups. Last year, she attended a PETA meeting intended to raise awareness about the horrors of the lab.\n\nKristen Cox listened as PETA members played down the significance of the latest gene therapy that could treat Duchenne patients, stressing that 95% of therapies in human clinical trials fail.\n\nShe rose to speak to the group.\n\n\u201cFor someone in my position, a 5% chance is huge,\u201d Kristen Cox recalled telling them. \u201cAnd when that first boy gets his cure, it\u2019s going to cure the dogs, too.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Dallas Morning News, http://www.dallasnews.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A colony of golden retrievers and Labrador mixes lives in an unmarked building at Texas A&M.
