For this reason, many journey to the city to spend their final days there.\n\nReuters photographer Danish Siddiqui documented \u201cMukti Bhavan\u201d or \u201cSalvation House,\u201d a charity-run hostel for people who wish to die in Varanasi. It has 12 rooms, a temple and small quarters for its priests. Guests can normally stay up to two weeks after which, if they haven\u2019t yet passed away, they are gently asked to leave.\n\nBhairav Nath Shukla, (left), is the hostel manager. The 61-year-old has been taking in the dying and performing prayers for their salvation for over four decades. More than 14,500 people have checked in to date.\n\nEighty-two-year-old Kishore Pandey travelled with his three daughters from a small village in eastern India to die at Mukti Bhavan. Traditionally in Hinduism sons perform the last rites for their parents but Pandey\u2019s daughters were there for him instead. The eldest, Usha Tiwari, explained: \"We had no brother but we didn't want our father to feel that he has no son.\"\n\nNinety-seven-year-old Bhogla Devi also came to the hostel accompanied by her 30-year-old grandson Divyesh Tiwari. \u201cMy grandmother is the most precious thing I ever had. I would like her to attain salvation in my arms,\" said Tiwari.\n\nChampa Devi, 88 years old, also came to Mukti Bhavan to die and passed away at the hostel on June 21. In the image above her daughter lies next to her minutes after her death.\n\nAfter dying at Varanasi, many are cremated at this holy site next to the River Ganges. Families can have their pictures taken with the deceased; many want to preserve memories of their loved ones being cremated at this sacred place.\n\nIn the image above, 105-year-old Munna Kuvar lies on a bed inside Mukti Bhavan. Her husband died in this hostel about 18 years ago and according to her 45-year-old nephew Surender Upadhyay, it was Kuvar\u2019s wish to die in the same place. \"We all have left our work and come here with her so that she can attain a peaceful death,\u201d he said. Kuvar died shortly after Danish Siddiqui finished shooting this photo story.", "description": "Munna Kuvar, 105, lies on a bed receiving comfort from her relatives as she waits to die in Varanasi, widely considered Hinduism's holiest city.", "authors": ["Danish Siddiqui"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQwFDiTtW-XE-Ixbved4sB9bgoRadziw_IqaQ-Km6zw9q9bu9peqg2H860ouD7F3q72btx4hjviTOFwj7JUNhcRAkBDJLWZfEUVTtDvlIiv7Q", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
