Bertelsman partially reversed that decision on Monday, ruling that of 33 allegedly defamatory statements in the Post\u2019s coverage of Sandmann, three of those statements could be challenged in court.\n\n\u201cThe Sandmann family and our legal team are grateful that Judge Bertelsman has allowed the case to proceed,\u201d said Sandmann family attorney Todd McMurtry in an email to the Washington Times. \u201cThe Court\u2019s ruling preserves the heart of the Nicholas Sandmann\u2019s claims. We can consider this a huge victory and look forward to initiating discovery against the Washington Post.\u201d\n\nOn January 18 of this year, Sandmann and classmates were in Washington, D.C. to participate in the March for Life, an annual pro-life demonstration. A viral video of Sandmann and his classmates appeared to show a confrontation between the students and a Native American man, Nathan Phillips.\n\nSandmann and several other students were wearing MAGA hats, and the Post asserted in its coverage of the incident that the students had blocked Phillips on his way to the Lincoln Memorial. Phillips told the Post that the students had surrounded him.\n\nThe three defamatory statements approved by Bertelsman for further investigation assert that Sandmann blocked Phillips\u2019s path.\n\nThe students were pilloried as racist on social media when the video went viral. However, longer videos of the incident showed that Phillips had in fact approached the students and started to drum loudly when he came close to Sandmann. The students were also chanting during the incident with permission of their instructor, to drown out the shouts of a group of black nationalists nearby who were yelling insults such as \u201cfa**ot\u201d and \u201ccracker\u201d at the group.\n\nCovington Catholic High School cancelled classes for several days after the incident due to online harassment of its students.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "A Covington Catholic High School student can move forward with his defamation suit against the Washington Post, a federal judge in Kentucky ruled on Monday.U.S. District Judge\u00a0William Bertelsman of Kentucky had ruled in July that the student, Nicholas Sandmann, could not sue the\u00a0Post for defamation.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hK78eBB6PMG8tHbHUMbF4g--~B/aD01NzY7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/8fd8ed5d8bf8514982162c5fa70c9216", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
