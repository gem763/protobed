The findings:\n\nMajority rules: \u201c A majority of Americans [58 percent] say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump,\u201d per our colleagues Dan Balz and Scott Clement.\n\nA majority of Americans [58 percent] say they endorse the decision by House Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry of President Trump,\u201d per our colleagues Dan Balz and Scott Clement. More: 49 percent of Americans support removing Trump from office.\n\nHalf measure: A further 6 percent endorse the decision to open an impeachment inquiry, but don't favor removing Trump from office.\n\nA further 6 percent endorse the decision to open an impeachment inquiry, but don't favor removing Trump from office. Flashback: Previous Post-Schar or Post-ABC News polls taken in 2019 showed that only 37 to 41 percent of Americans favored such a step, Dan and Scott write.\n\nPrevious Post-Schar or Post-ABC News polls taken in 2019 showed that only 37 to 41 percent of Americans favored such a step, Dan and Scott write. Yikes: Asked about Trump's overall conduct, 60 percent of. Americans responded that the president \u201cdoes not uphold adequate standards for ethics in government,\u201d versus 35 percent who said he does.\n\nThe swing comes in the aftermath of the revelations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nBut the gaping partisan divide still exists:\n\n\u201cMore than 8 in 10 Democrats endorse the inquiry and nearly 8 in 10 favor a vote to recommend that Trump be removed from office. Among Republicans, roughly 7 in 10 do not support the inquiry but almost 3 in 10 do, and almost one-fifth of Republicans say they favor a vote recommending his removal,\u201d per Dan and Scott.\n\nHowever, among independents, support for the impeachment investigation is at 57 percent. Forty-nine percent of independents believe the House should vote to impeach Trump and remove him from office.\n\nThe poll identified the catalyst sparking the biggest shifts in public concern: the release of the rough transcript of the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump has repeatedly called the phone call \"perfect\" and questioned the whistleblower's knowledge of it, although the transcript confirms many of the details in the whistleblower's complaint.\n\nAsked about the call between the two world leaders, 62 percent of American compared to 32 percent felt that Trump's request to investigate the Bidens was inappropriate. \u201cOver 8 in 10 Democrats call the request inappropriate, as do 63 percent of independents,\u201d Dan and Scott write.\n\nOnly one third of Republicans said the contents of the call were inappropriate.\n\nOn Biden: Despite the onslaught of unsubstantiated attacks from Trump and his allies, out poll found that a majority of voters believe Biden would \u201cuphold adequate standards for ethics in government were he to become president.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose results also split along partisan lines, with 72 percent of Democrats saying Biden would uphold ethical standards, while 63 percent of Republicans say he would not.\u201d\n\nAlso: The findings highlight Trump's problems with younger voters and women.\n\nWomen: \" \u2026 65 percent of women favoring the impeachment inquiry, compared with 51 percent of men.\u201d\n\n\" \u2026 65 percent of women favoring the impeachment inquiry, compared with 51 percent of men.\u201d Millennials: \u201cBroken down by age groups, 40 percent of Republican-leaning adults ages 18-39 endorse the start of the impeachment inquiry, compared with 23 percent of those ages 40-64 and 13 percent of those age 65 and older.\u201d\n\n\u201cBroken down by age groups, 40 percent of Republican-leaning adults ages 18-39 endorse the start of the impeachment inquiry, compared with 23 percent of those ages 40-64 and 13 percent of those age 65 and older.\u201d College degrees: \u201cA majority (61 percent) of white college graduates favor the inquiry, while whites without college degrees, a mainstay of Trump\u2019s support, are split: 47 percent in favor and 48 percent in opposition.\u201d\n\nBottom line: The public, for now at least, is siding with congressional Democrats and Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on an impeachment probe.\n\nA majority of Americans approve of the way Democrats are handling the inquiry (49 percent) compared to 56 percent of Americans who say they disapprove of the way congressional Republicans are responding to the inquiry.\n\nWatch your back: \u201cHowever, in a potential warning sign to Democrats, 50 percent of Americans say that the impeachment proceeding is distracting Congress from more important issues, slightly higher than the percent who disagree (46 percent).\u201d\n\nIt's a little-known fact that a lawyer who emails the scan of a signed printout of a legal letter originally typed out in Comic Sans is automatically disbarred pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90(2) https://t.co/Rwakta4Gk3 \u2014 Letters of Note (@LettersOfNote) October 7, 2019\n\nThe latest on impeachment: \u201cCall me.\u201d Lawmakers will today hear from Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who sent those fateful two words when asked by a career diplomat just over a month ago whether \u201csecurity assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations\u201d regarding the Trump administration\u2019s delay in sending aid to Ukraine. An owner of boutique motels, entities connected to Sondland donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration before he was appointed to his position in Brussels. Now almost a dozen House Democrats want him to resign.\n\nStayed tuned: Sondland will be testifying behind closed doors, but our colleagues will have you covered throughout the day. (And remember to save our impeachment calendar.)\n\nWhat else is happening:\n\nDems are nervous their GOP colleagues will leak the whistleblower\u2019s identity: So concerned they are considering extraordinary measures to protect him by \"having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and voice, these officials said,\u201d our colleagues Rachael Bade, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian report.\n\nSo concerned they are considering extraordinary measures to protect him by \"having the whistleblower testify from a remote location and obscuring the individual\u2019s appearance and voice, these officials said,\u201d our colleagues Rachael Bade, Greg Miller, Ellen Nakashima and Karoun Demirjian report. OMB and Pentagon get subpoenaed: The two agencies now have until Oct. 15 to turn over any potential notes, transcripts, and recordings related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky and the broader issue of withholding aid, according to the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s subpoena.\n\nThe two agencies now have until Oct. 15 to turn over any potential notes, transcripts, and recordings related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky and the broader issue of withholding aid, according to the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s subpoena.

The response was comic(al): Dowd sent his official reply to lawmakers in a note with the often-mocked comic sans font. Many on Twitter mocked that choice.\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

(Nazeer Al-khatib / AFP)\n\nThe Policies\n\nCONFUSION REIGNS IN SYRIA AND WASHINGTON: Trump's unexpected announcement to draw down the U.S. military presence in northern Syria to make way for Turkish troops was received with confusion and criticism -- at home and abroad.\n\nIn a rare public split with the president, Republicans railed against the decision, all but making certain that a veto-proof action to oppose the decision.\n\nBad timing: \u201cThe mounting opposition means that Trump is facing some of the sharpest criticism he has received from his party at the same time that his political survival could be in the hands of Republican senators forming a bulwark against a growing impeachment threat,\u201d our colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Seung Min Kim report.\n\n\u201cA precipitous withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement urging Trump to reconsider his position. \u201cAnd it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement urging Trump to reconsider his position. \u201cAnd it would increase the risk that ISIS and other terrorist groups regroup.\u201d Republicans also argued that abandoning the allied Kurdish fighters would hurt tU.S. credibility: \u201cThis betrayal of the Kurds will also severely harm our credibility as an ally the world over,\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump should rethink this decision immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis betrayal of the Kurds will also severely harm our credibility as an ally the world over,\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump should rethink this decision immediately.\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) released a joint statement demanding congressional hearings on the action as soon as possible: \u201cBarring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests,\u201d the two senators said.\n\nSanctions on the way?: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said \u201che plans to introduce bipartisan legislation with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) to impose sanctions against Turkey if its forces invade Syria, and could call for Turkey\u2019s suspension from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said he expected sanctions against Turkey would get 'veto-proof' support in Congress,\u201d per the Wall Street Journal's Lindsay Wise.\n\nJust spoke to Sen @ChrisVanHollen about situation in Syria.\n\n\n\nWe will introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria and will call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the U.S. in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 7, 2019\n\nTrump, however, defended his decision and proceeded to issue a warning to the Turkish government in a widely mocked tweet:\n\nShot: \u201cIt is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d Chase: \u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nFrom the Kurdish perspective, Trump's decision was viewed by our allies who stood alongside the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State \u201cas a betrayal of the trust established during the fight, which has cost the lives of more than 12,000 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces, the joint Kurdish-Arab militia formed to battle the militants,\u201d our colleagues Liz Sly, Sarah Dadouch annd Asser Khattab report.\n\n\u201cOur brave men and women with the Syrian Democratic \u00adForces have just won a historic victory over the ISIS \u2018caliphate,\u2019 a victory announced by President Trump and celebrated across the world. To abandon us now would be tragic,\u201d the Syrian Democratic Coalition, the political wing of the SDF, said in a statement.\u201d\n\nThe scene on the ground in northeastern Syria as word of the announcement rippled across the world was chaotic, according to NBC News's Carol Lee and Courtney Kube.\n\n\u201cAt 3 a.m. local time, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces, Gen. Mazloum Kobane, also received a phone call from a senior U.S. official telling him to get on a video teleconference with an American military commander who informed him President Donald Trump had ordered U.S. troops to withdraw,\u201d they report.\n\n\u201cThis decision, this is something we don't expect at all,\" Kobane told Lee and Kube in an interview.\n\nBut it wasn't just the Kurds who were blindsided: \"According to multiple current and former U.S. officials, the White House's announcement of the decision late Sunday night blindsided not just America's Kurdish partners in the fight against the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, in Syria, but almost everyone \u2014 senior officials at the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House, lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East.\"\n\nIn an effort to quiet some of the backlash, the State Department told reporters on background that Trump did not endorse a Turkish invasion of Syria, which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been threatening for months.\n\n\u201cWe do not support [the Turkish] operation in any way, shape or form, everybody from the president on down, was working on the safe zone implementation,\u201d a senior State Department official told reporters, according to our colleagues Karen DeYoung, Missy Ryan, Kareem Fahim and Sarah Dadouch. \u201cThe president made it very clear that we would not support this operation in any way, shape, or form.\u201d\n\nOn The Hill\n\nMORE LAWMAKERS BASH NBA OVER HONG KONG: More presidential candidates and both the House and Senate minority leaders harangued the NBA over its decision to distance itself from a Houston Rockets executive's tweet in favor of the pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong as the episode continued to spark a bipartisan brouhaha, our colleague Ben Golliver reports.\n\nNo one should implement a gag rule on Americans speaking out for freedom.\n\n\n\nI stand with the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democratic rights.\n\n\n\nI stand with Americans who want to voice their support for the people of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nUnacceptablehttps://t.co/5B5KMGZujh \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 7, 2019\n\nTwo senators took their response an extra step: Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) requested a meeting with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver (it was denied). While Sen.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called on the league to cancel its exhibition games in China this week, which are part of a decade-long tradition to gain a foothold in the lucrative country known for its love of basketball. The number of NBA coaches and players who have spoken out on a number of political issues has made the league an easy target: \u201cI thought the @NBA was proud to be the 'wokest professional sports league'?\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) sniped on Twitter with a link to a past column praising the league for letting players speak out. \u201cI guess that only applies to speaking out on American politics & social issues.\" \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n\u201cI thought the @NBA was proud to be the 'wokest professional sports league'?\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) sniped on Twitter with a link to a past column praising the league for letting players speak out. \u201cI guess that only applies to speaking out on American politics & social issues.\" The amount of GOP lawmakers speaking out has struck some as odd: Some Republicans, including Rubio, dismissed concerns over Trump publicly asking for China to intervene in the election yet have been outspoken on this. \u201cThe idea of China interfering in the sanctity of the NBA is somehow incredibly offensive to them,\u201d CNN anchor Jake Tapper told Politico's Michael Calderone, \u201cwhereas the same standard for American elections results in the sound of crickets.\u201d\n\nThis all comes at a big moment for U.S.-China relations: Trade talks between the world's two largest economies are scheduled to resume this week in Washington. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that China jhas been a \u201clittle more cooperative recently\u201d after it resumed purchasing U.S. agricultural goods like soybeans. Trump was far from optimistic, \u201cCan something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows. But I think it\u2019s probably unlikely.\u201d\n\nChinese companies added to blacklist for 'Uighur abuse\u200b\u200b': \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe Trump administration added 28 new Chinese organizations to the so-called trade blacklist, which the Commerce Department said was due to their role in \u201chuman rights violations and abuses \u2026 against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\u201d The new additions include two of the world's largest manufactures of video surveillance products, the Times's Ana Swanson and Paul Mozur report.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, center, in Athens on Sunday.
