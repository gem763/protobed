It comes as little surprise then, that he\u2019s now weighing in on the latest controversy around America\u2019s 45th president \u2013 and he\u2019s clear on what he thinks should happen.\n\n\u201cI hope he gets impeached, it has to be followed through,\u201d the veteran actor, told Variety this week, adding \u201cHe\u2019s such a lowlife\u2026 He taints everybody around him.\u201d\n\nRead more: Robert De Niro calls Donald Trump a \u2018total loser\u2019\n\nThe Oscar-winner hasn\u2019t always been so dismissive of the president. He admitted he was willing to give the celebrity businessman a chance when he first came to office, explaining on US chat show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that it mattered to him that he gave the US leader a shot.\n\n\u201cI said right after he was elected. Give him a chance. I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. This guy has proven himself to be a total loser.\u201d\n\nThe current scandal around Donald Trump revolves around an allegation that he asked the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into his political rival Joe Biden. The story came to light when a CIA whistleblower leaked the information, which then triggered an impeachment inquiry on September 24.\n\nDe Niro made his comments at the premiere of his new movie The Irishman, which sees the actor continue his long-time collaboration with director Martin Scorsese. He is joined on screen by Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin.\n\nRead more: Robert De Niro's de-ageing in 'The Irishman' revealed in new Netflix trailer\n\nDe Niro finished by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful with this guy.
