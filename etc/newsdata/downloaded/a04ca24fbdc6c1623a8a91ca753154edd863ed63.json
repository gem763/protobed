The companies are developing a virtual platform that combines Corning's wireless connectivity portfolio and Intel's hardware and software to create an indoor 5G solution that fuses fiber and virtualization. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nFiber better ensures a stable 5G connection, while virtualization, which replaces network hardware with software, enables customers to more efficiently and affordably scale the technology across venues of all sizes. Corning and Intel expect their solution to be commercially available in 2020.\n\nCorning and Intel's solution aims to solve a pain point of 5G networks: signal penetration. Due to their short wavelengths, mmWave 5G signals can be blocked by physical barriers like walls or even glass. A signal's difficulty in moving from outdoors to indoors can result in poor indoor coverage for 5G customers, degrading their network experience. In fact, a PCMag.com study found that when Verizon initially launched its 5G network in Chicago in April 2019, 4G LTE provided faster download speeds than mmWave 5G through glass and stone barriers.\n\nEnsuring that consumers have a strong indoor signal is extremely important for telecoms, as around 80% of all mobile data traffic is consumed indoors. Telecoms like AT&T or Verizon that initially deploy 5G networks that rely heavily on mmWave 5G could struggle to see uptake, given that faster speeds are the top-cited (66%) reason why consumers are excited for 5G. It's also the top reason (63%) consumers would be willing to pay more for 5G.\n\nCorning and Intel will compete with a host of other solutions in the market as telecoms and tech companies realize the importance of extending fast data speeds indoors. In an effort to solve the 5G penetration issue, South Korean telecom KT developed 5G-signal repeater hardware specifically geared for use in buildings.\n\nVerizon partnered with Boingo Wireless to build a hyper-dense indoor network involving Boingo's distributed antenna system. And US chip designer Qualcomm has suggested telecoms deploy dedicated indoor 5G networks in tandem with outdoor deployments to ensure better coverage. Whichever company innovates the most efficient and scalable method to provide widespread indoor 5G will likely see sizable demand as telecoms race to provide the widest-reaching 5G networks.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
