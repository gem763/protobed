That is true, but it does not suggest any bias or partiality.\u201d\n\nPolster oversees more than 2,000 lawsuits by state and local municipalities over opioids, including a bellwether trial by Ohio\u2019s Cuyahoga and Summit counties scheduled for October 21.\n\nThe companies that sought Polster\u2019s disqualification included the retailers CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) and Walmart Inc (WMT.N), and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N), Henry Schein Inc (HSIC.O) and McKesson Corp (MCK.N).\n\nTheir lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers representing the counties had no immediate comment.\n\nThe request for Polster\u2019s disqualification followed a series of rulings by him in the counties\u2019 favor, including that they could try to show that various corporate defendants created a public nuisance.\n\nOpioid addiction claimed roughly 400,000 lives in the United States form 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe companies had argued that Polster tipped his hand beginning as early as January 2018 when the litigation that they would have to foot the bill for the epidemic.\n\nThey have also said the potential costs could be enormous, saying the plaintiffs in the Ohio case were seeking $8 billion in cash to cover fallout.\n\nPolster, however, said the main point of his public comments was to show that the judiciary was \u201cup to the task\u201d of addressing the crisis, whether through fairly-negotiated settlements or fairly-fought litigation.\n\n\u201cThe burden to sustain a motion to disqualify a judge is exceedingly high,\u201d he added, \u201cand the moving defendants have not met it.\u201d\n\nPurdue Pharma LP, the maker of Oxycontin and one of the main defendants, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15 after reaching an agreement to settle claims in the litigation and by 24 U.S. states.", "description": "The U.S. judge overseeing nationwide litigation over the opioid epidemic on Thursday refused to disqualify himself, after major pharmacies and drug distributors said he was biased against them and pressing too hard for a costly settlement.", "authors": ["Jonathan Stempel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
