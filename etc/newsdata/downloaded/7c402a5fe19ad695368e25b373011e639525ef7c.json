But the question remains, she added, of what to do about people, including former smokers, who vape and are addicted to nicotine.\n\n\"If all flavors are taken away from the market ... are they going to now turn to using cigarettes? What are they going to do to take care of their addiction if they don't like these products anymore? We don't know.\"\n\nReinforcing the allure\n\nsecond study published Monday in the same journal, Pediatrics, found that young people exposed to e-cig marketing were more likely to experiment within the following year.\n\nIn the study, the authors said they \"suspect that e-cigarette marketing may shape viewers' behavior by introducing attractive flavors, reinforcing the alluring social benefits of vaping, illuminating the lifestyles of celebrities and young models, and offering price promotions and direct access to e-cigarette retail Web sites.\"\n\nMore than 70% of participants, who had never previously used tobacco, said they noticed ads for e-cigarettes in the previous month on a variety of platforms. The data came from 12- to 24-year-olds who were surveyed between 2014 and 2016.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Social media plays a huge role, especially in youth uptake,\" said Krishnan-Sarin, who co-authored a study last year that linked vaping ads on social media to an increased likelihood that kids who had never vaped would end up using them down the line.\n\n\"Word spreads very fast through social media of the emergence of a new product, the emergence of a new flavor, the emergence of a new behavior,\" including how to \"hack,\" or customize, vapes and perform tricks with them.\n\nWhile vaping content on social media is often user-generated , a number of videos and posts have been sponsored by the vaping industry or shared by paid influencers, as well.\n\nIn the newly published study, the authors say they may even be underestimating the prevalence of e-cigarette advertising seen by youth, in part because some online content \"may not be perceived as e-cigarette advertising by young people.\"", "description": "Vaping companies are under scrutiny for how their marketing and sweet flavors have appealed to young people -- and two new studies published Monday illustrate how both may have influenced vaping habits.", "authors": ["Michael Nedelman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180516171927-vape-vaping-stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
