Crude prices dipped again Tuesday on reports of more punitive U.S. action for China, even as the Federal Reserve indicated easing action that could help commodities.\n\nsettled down 12 cents at $52.62 per barrel.\n\nclosed down 11 cents at $58.24.\n\nCrude prices fell almost 1% earlier in the sesion on reports that the White House was moving ahead with efforts to limit capital flows into China and adding more Chinese firms to a blacklist.\n\nA South China Morning Post report said that China had toned down expectations ahead of high-level trade talks between the two countries set to resume on Thursday after being stalled since May. The report said the Chinese delegation could depart Washington a day earlier than scheduled.\n\nChina also signaled it would hit back after the U.S. placed eight of the country\u2019s technology giants on a blacklist over alleged human rights violations against Muslim minorities, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAsked Tuesday whether China would retaliate over the blacklist, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters: \u201cStay tuned.\u201d He also denied that Beijing was guilty of human rights abuse in the far west region of Xinjiang.\n\n\u201cObviously, this is casting a darker shadow on the trade talk optimism that we saw yesterday,\u201d Phil Flynn, energy markets analyst at the Price Futures Group in Chicago, said.\n\nToward the close, oil pared much of its losses after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will resume purchases of Treasury securities in an effort to avoid a repeat of recent turmoil in money markets.\n\nPowell left his options open on interest rates ahead of the central bank\u2019s policy meeting scheduled for Oct. 29-30.\n\nBut Investing.com\u2019s showed the probability for a rate cut as high as 82.3% for the forthcoming meeting, versus 72.7% on Monday. So far this year, the Fed has conducted two quarter-point rate cuts, back to back in July and September, to try and preserve the U.S. economy' record decade-long growth.\n\n\u201cSo, while the Fed might indirectly be helping oil and other commodities with its asset purchases, Trump is continuing to hammer the markets by intensifying his war with China,\u201d said John Kilduff, founding partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.\n\nIt was not just trade troubles in oil\u2019s way on Tuesday.\n\nDemand for crude also appeared to be turning into a problem with the U.S. Energy Information Administration cutting this year\u2019s world oil demand growth by 50,000 barrels per day and its 2020 projection by 100,000 bpd.\n\nThe EIA also projected output to rise by 1.27 million bpd to 12.26 million this year and by 910,000 to reach 13.17 million in 2020.", "description": "Oil down, Stuck in Range Trade as Trump Again Hits China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC0K0JU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
