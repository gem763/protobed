It's both stupid and hypocritical.\n\nUS Hypocrisy on Display\n\nOnce again the US is meddling in the internal affairs of other counties while going on a hissy fit when any country does that to us.\n\nPlease consider [U.S. House Passes Bill Aimed at Supporting Hong Kong Protests](U.S. House Passes Bill Aimed at Supporting Hong Kong Protests)\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act is one of four measures passed by the House Tuesday in unanimous voice votes. The bill provides for sanctions against officials \u201cresponsible for undermining fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong.\u201d \u201cHuman rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation. The HKSAR government attaches great importance to them and is determined to safeguard them,\u201d the spokesman said, referring to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Chinese government opposes the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, H.R. 3289, saying that it \u201cgrossly interferes in China\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d \u201cChina strongly urges certain people in the U.S. Congress to grasp the situation, immediately stop advancing the bill regarding Hong Kong and interfering in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs to avoid further damaging China-U.S. relations,\u201d said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nOutrage\n\nImagine the outrage if China, the EU, or Japan passed a bill condemning US drone policy, US involvement in Afghanistan, or any other well-deserved criticism of the US.\n\nWe would tell them to butt out.\n\nYet, the US feels free to butt into the affairs of every other country in the world.\n\nUS meddling\n\nHistory shows that US meddling created problems in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Iran, Afghanistan, and Vietnam for starters.\n\nIndividual expression is one thing, and I support that.\n\nBut official US meddling is counterproductive.\n\nIt's very disappointing that the bill passed unanimously. Can't anyone think?\n\nTrump should veto this legislation if the Senate is foolish enough to go along.", "description": "The US House passed a bill in support of Hong .10/16/2019 16:36:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/226/9cec78a8-8d9a-44c3-8bb9-3f877a1912b2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
