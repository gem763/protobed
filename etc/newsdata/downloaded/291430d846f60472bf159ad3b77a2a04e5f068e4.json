Despite diplomatic efforts to keep their cases from public attention, the pair was named overnight on social media.\n\nUnrelated to the couple\u2019s case, a third Australian is also being held in Evin prison, reportedly in solitary confinement. The Cambridge-educated academic had been lecturing at an Australian university before she was arrested last year. She has reportedly been tried \u2013 the charges are unknown \u2013 and sentenced to 10 years in jail.\n\nThe Australian government has been negotiating for the release of all three Australians since their arrests, news of which became public on Wednesday. The Guardian understands both Firkin and Jolie were travelling on Australian passports.\n\nMark Firkin and Jolie King in a picture from their Instagram account. Photograph: Supplied/Instagram\n\nThe families of Firkin and King released a statement saying: \u201cOur families hope to see Mark and Jolie safely home as soon as possible.\u201d They said they would not be commenting further and asked for privacy.\n\nThe editor of the Persian-language broadcaster Manoto TV, Pouria Zeraati, said on Twitter a source had told him the couple had been arrested \u201cfor flying a drone near the capital, Tehran\u201d.\n\nEarlier reports suggested the couple had been camping in a military area around Jajrood in Tehran province.\n\nThe couple were blogging their travels on YouTube and Instagram. Dozens of videos and photographs posted online appear to have been shot using a drone.\n\n\u201cThe family says this was a misunderstanding and Jolie King and her fiance Mark Firkin were unaware of the Iranian law which bans drone flights without a licence,\u201d Zeraati said online.\n\n\u201cTheir trial has not been held yet and it is not clear what the Islamic Republic [of Iran] wants out of this arrest, as no one from the judiciary or intelligence services has made any comment on this.\u201d\n\nAustralia to join US military effort to protect shipping in the Strait of Hormuz Read more\n\nKing, a building designer, and Firkin, a construction manager, have been documenting their travels on a blog called The Way Overland.\n\nOn a plan listed on their blog, the couple said their plan was to drive from their home in the Perth suburb of Cottlesloe to London in a Toyota Landcruiser they converted into a mobile home.\n\nKing and Firkin started by driving north to Darwin, where they shipped their car to Timor-Leste. The pair then drove through Indonesia, shipped the car to Malaysia and drove up through south-east Asia, India and Pakistan.\n\nThe couple posted a video roughly once a week to YouTube and social media, and people following their journey raised concerns when there was silence from the pair.\n\nTheir last post on social media was from the Naryn region of Kyrgyzstan on 26 June. Their last video was from Pakistan, posted on 25 June, showing the pair driving the Karakoram Highway.\n\nTheir final activity on social media appears to have been on Sunday 30 June. Followers and friends began posting increasingly alarmed comments after their accounts fell silent, asking if they were safe.\n\nOn social media, Firkin has said he is from Coffs Harbour in New South Wales, and the couple moved to Perth from 2015.\n\nThere is little information publicly known about the third Australian being held in Evin. Also a British-Australian, the Cambridge-educated academic had been teaching at a university in Melbourne.\n\nShe was arrested in Iran late last year. The Guardian understands the woman has been tried \u2013 on unknown charges \u2013 and jailed for 10 years. She is reportedly being held in solitary confinement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Firkin and Jolie King in a picture posted on their blog.

We can\u2019t guarantee consular access if you are detained or arrested. We also can\u2019t guarantee access to legal representation.\u201d\n\nThe advice also urges travellers not to visit military or nuclear sites, which, it says, \u201care not always clearly marked\u201d.\n\nThe UK\u2019s defence secretary Ben Wallace, said on Thursday: \u201cThe message to Iran is to follow the international rule of law, to respect freedom of navigation in the Straits, and to release people that have been detained in the way they have been over the last few years.\u201d\n\nIran has not commented on the arrests, and not yet given any indication the Australians are being held. But Tehran has previously expressed a willingness to engineer prisoner swaps to retrieve Iranian citizens held in foreign jails.\n\nIn April, Iran\u2019s foreign affairs minister Mohammad Javad Zarif proposed a prisoner swap involving Negar Ghodskani, an Iranian citizen then held in an Adelaide jail and facing extradition to the US on suspicion of smuggling restricted American technology to Iran.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have an exchange. I\u2019m ready to do it.\n\n\u201cI have the authority to do it. We\u2019ve informed the government of the United States six months ago that we are ready.\u201d\n\nLast month Ghodskani, having acceded to the extradition request, pleaded guilty to being part of a conspiracy to evade US sanctions and illegally export controlled technology. She faces up to five years in jail.\n\nRelations between Iran and Australia are robust. Australia has maintained diplomatic relations with Tehran through recent decades where other western nations have abandoned them, or they have become acutely strained.\n\nBut in August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz, off Iran\u2019s south coast, through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. Scott Morrison said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Couple left Perth in 2017 and had been documenting their travels as they drove to London before being detained in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison", "authors": ["Ben Doherty", "Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345fef75ca043328161597b28f74700d1af8de2b/0_83_879_527/master/879.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1651bf078242f6ab5bc601d573c56b7b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
