There will also be ongoing trial and error attempts to gain the most profitable product mix over time.\n\nVapes\n\nVapes are probably the most important category of the next stage of cannabis products because they're most in demand and command a price premium, although Aurora management did say it's going to offer a variety of vape products at different price points, targeting all the \"major consumer markets.\"\n\nThe major concern here is how much impact the vaping crisis will have on sales. While the vast majority of health issues and deaths have come from vape sales in the black market, it has cast a shadow on vaping in general.\n\nIt's probable that this will be more visible and less of a concern by the time sales are launched in the latter half of December 2019.\n\nEdibles\n\nThe initial offering in the edibles category will include baked goods, chocolates, gummies, and mints. How it works is \"cannabis extract is infused throughout the product to provide consistency, texture and a great flavor.\"\n\nConcerning gummies and candies, the company said it has entered into two key partnerships with leading companies to devloped infused candies containing THC and CBD. Management claims it has positioned the company to be the market leader in Canada for edibles.\n\nIt has also entered into a two-year global agreement to license JACEK Chocolate Couture's IP. JACEK is a luxury chocolate brand that Aurora will work with to develop cannabis-infused caramel filled chocolates and chocolate squares.\n\nOn the baked goods side of the business, it has entered into a exclusive partnership with WG Pro-Manufacturing & Touch\u00e9 Bakery. Its Aurora River team will work with the two companies to develop this part of the derivatives market.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Aurora Cannabis (ACB) is well-positioned for the inevitable rebound in the cannabis sector, as it ramps up production capacity, boosts its GMP-compliant output, and develops a variety of derivative products to serve the Canadian and international markets.By the end of June 2020, the company expects to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MG5HnIl5ZyqcXa9GwTm3iQ--~B/aD01Mjc7dz0xNDk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/tipranks_452/d5ff2d93b72d57d0af1b1e1266ff5024", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
