Murders of police officers also fell \u2013 from 373 to 343.\n\nBut femicides rose by more than 4% to 1,206.\n\nA total of 66,041 incidents of sexual violence were reported in 2018, of which 82% were against women and girls, a 4.1% rise on the previous year and the highest number ever registered. More than half of the female victims were girls under 13.\n\nWith 263,067 domestic violence injuries reported, the figures indicated a woman was attacked in Brazil every two minutes.\n\nBueno cited Bolsonaro\u2019s inflammatory language \u2013 such as telling a congresswoman she did not deserve to be raped and his praise for cold war-era Latin American torturers \u2013 as contributing factors.\n\n'We are afraid': Brazilian women alarmed at relaxation of gun laws Read more\n\n\u201cHe is always sharing with people what he thinks of women, what he thinks of torture. It\u2019s hard not to believe that if you have a maximum authority saying this that this does not have an impact on people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are more prejudiced because we have political leaders who articulate this.\u201d\n\nBeatriz Accioly Lins, an anthropologist and researcher at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and specialist in violence against women, said the numbers showed more women were coming forward. Reported incidents of sexual violence have risen in recent years \u2013 up 3.5% in 2016 and 10.1% in 2017.\n\n\u201cWomen are more and more thinking again about what they have gone through \u2026 and realising that these are not just difficult or bad things but crimes,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we can expect to see these figures increase in the coming years.\u201d\n\nShe said that Bolsonaro\u2019s move to set up a ministry of women, family and human rights \u2013 run by an evangelical pastor, Damares Alves, who celebrated her inauguration by saying that \u201cboys wear blue and girls wear pink\u201d \u2013 showed how Brazil had regressed to a \u201cvery traditional\u201d concept of the family as it swung to the right.\n\nAccioly said the number of rapes of girls showed how Brazilian society \u201csexualised girls very young\u201d.\n\n\u201cThose who work in this area recognise that violence against girls is very high at this age,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the reality we live in.\u201d\n\nKillings by police officers during and outside service soared 20%, to 6,220, a trend that is likely to continue as Bolsonaro pushes legislation to shield from prosecution members of the security forces and citizens who shoot alleged offenders. Throughout last year\u2019s election campaign Bolsonaro spoke enthusiastically about the use of lethal force and promised to loosen gun ownership laws. Gun ownership has surged, and nearly 200,000 new weapons were registered by Brazilians in 2018 \u2013 a 42% rise from the previous year.\n\nVideo of black teen whipped for stealing chocolate sparks outrage in Brazil Read more\n\n\u201cBrazilian society has become more aggressive,\u201d said Leila Linhares Barsted, a lawyer and executive coordinator of Cepia, a non-profit human rights group. \u201cSince last year we have had an increase in hate speech, in the perception that women should be submissive to men.\u201d\n\nReported racial abuse incidents rose 20% to 7,600 and murders of LGBT people rose 10% to 109. \u201cBrazil always had a racial issue,\u201d Linhares Barsted said. \u201cWhat we see today is this racism coming out of the closet.\u201d", "description": "A total of 66,041 incidents of sexual violence were reported in 2018 against the polarising backdrop of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s election victory", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55208c5730716e7e4842428ebd95d14f6c951633/0_176_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c78092ffb37e355d1e15b87ef979087", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
