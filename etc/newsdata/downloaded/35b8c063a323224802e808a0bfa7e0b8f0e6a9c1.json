But he\u2019s had a god deal to say recently, warning that re-electing President Donald Trump would be \u201ca disaster\u201d and expressing hopes that his Carter Center will become a more forceful advocate against armed conflicts in the future, including \u201cwars by the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to keep the whole world at peace,\u201d Carter said as he presented his annual Carter Center report last month.\n\n\u201cWe have been at war more than 226 years. We have been at peace for about 16 years\u201d since the Declaration of Independence in 1776, he said. And every U.S. military conflict from the Korean War onward has been a war of \u201cchoice,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 39th president survived a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 and surpassed George H.W. Bush as the longest-lived U.S. president in history. He\u2019s had some trouble walking after a hip replacement in May, but still teaches Sunday School in Plains, and with his wife of 73 years, Rosalynn, now 92, still plans an upcoming trip to help build houses with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nIn his latest appearances at the Carter Center and in a town hall at Emory University, Carter blasted money in politics, urged action to combat the climate crisis, and celebrated the Carter Center\u2019s work on public health, election monitoring and conflict resolution. But he said the center can do more to constructively criticize U.S. military engagements. The Carter Center has \u201cnever voiced an opinion publicly\u201d on individual wars, he said with some regret, adding: \u201cThis is primarily my fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States is very deeply inclined to go to war,\u201d Carter said, partly to \u201cimplant American policies\u201d in other countries, and partly to \u201cmake a hero\u201d out of wartime commanders in chief. This has significant economic consequences, he said: China has \u201cbeen at peace\u201d since he normalized relations with Beijing in 1979, and while the U.S. has spent trillions on military conflict, China has invested similar amounts in high-speed rail, new college campuses and other infrastructure.\n\nCarter talks with the realism of a nonagenarian, born in 1924 when the world population was a quarter of what it is today and life expectancy for American males was 58 years. Saying he plans to start spending more time with his extended family, he told the Carter Center audience that \u201cthis may be our last conversation with you ... we may or may not have one next year.\u201d\n\nCarter has been accepting visits from several 2020 presidential candidate s, but he\u2019s held back on endorsing any of his fellow Democrats, offering only clues to his thinking.\n\nSee: Jimmy Carter says he couldn\u2019t have managed the presidency at age 80\n\nCarter said he voted for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton last time, but warns that embracing single-payer, government-run health insurance could cost the Democrats votes among moderates and independents. That could rule out Sanders and another progressive favorite, Elizabeth Warren. But Carter also said he\u2019d like to see a woman as president. He said he couldn\u2019t have managed his presidential duties when he was 80, which would nix not only Sanders, at 78, but former Vice President Joe Biden, who is 76. Warren is 70, meaning she\u2019d be nearly 80 at the end of a two-term presidency.\n\nCarter said only that he\u2019ll be \u201cvoting Democratic\u201d in the general election. By then, he\u2019ll be 96.\n\nSee: Former President Jimmy Carter says there is no doubt that Russian interference made Trump president", "description": "Carter in March surpassed George H.W.
