More than 202,000 people are now enrolled to vote in the referendum.\n\nUnder a peace agreement signed after a nine-year civil war with the PNG mainland that ended in 1998, Bougainville has until mid-2020 to hold the referendum.\n\nThe civil war was largely about how profits from a giant mine, Panguna, should be shared, and it forced miner Rio Tinto (LON: ) to abandon the mine.\n\nAt the time, the mine was the largest source of export revenue for Papua New Guinea and comprised about 7% of global copper production.\n\nThe conflict between Bougainville's rebel guerrilla army and Papua New Guinea forces left as many as 20,000 dead, the worst conflict in the Oceania region since World War Two.", "description": "Bougainville independence vote from PNG scheduled for Nov 23 to Dec 7", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_3_800x533_L_1412601605.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
