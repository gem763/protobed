Cancer does not slow down for anyone, and neither will we.\n\n\u2018We will continue to push towards getting innovative, new treatments to patients as quickly as possible.\u2019\n\nMartin Freeman added: \u2018Stand Up To Cancer is a great opportunity to raise awareness of the tireless work that is being carried out by scientists across the UK every day.\n\n\u2018Research is the key to making progress, and the sooner we fund more research, the sooner we can find better treatments and cures. No one should have to go through the pain cancer brings.\u2019\n\nThe Stand Up To Cancer campaign will continue throughout October and urges people to get involved in raising money for live-saving cancer research by anything from fancy dress, to cooking for friends and family or taking on a gaming challenge.\n\nPrevious stars that have got involved in the campaign include Naomi Campbell, Noel Gallagher, Tom Hardy, Gillian Anderson, Idris Elba and James Corden.\n\nFor more information on how to get involved, head to the Stand Up For Cancer website.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
