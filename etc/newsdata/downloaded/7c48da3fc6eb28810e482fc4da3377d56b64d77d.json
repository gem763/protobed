He also interviewed 128 Americans with $35,000 or less in annual gross income and $5,000 or less in liquid assets.\n\nThrough these conversations and further analysis, he was able to identify two types of habits: those that helped people build wealth (\"rich habits\"), and those that worked against them. The latter habits have the power to cause financial, emotional, and mental destruction in a person's life, he says. To achieve success, one must identify these habits and replace them.\n\n\"Adopting one rich habit has the effect of eliminating many poor habits. That's why the rich habits are so powerful.
