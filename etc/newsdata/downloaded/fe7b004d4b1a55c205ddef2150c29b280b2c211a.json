The bizarre-looking seedling brings sorely needed business to the Skid Row shop but then displays a taste for eating people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPuppet designer MattaMagical conjures Audrey II with a series of striking creations, from geranium-size shoot to hulking green predator. Marty Austin Lamar voices the leafy monster, his resonant singing nicely meshing with the plant\u2019s R&B numbers, and his expressiveness fusing with that of Rj Pavel, the puppeteer.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s stooped, bespectacled Seymour is distinctively dweeby, and Danskey\u2019s version of the hapless Audrey \u2014 who longs to live in a Pine-Sol-scented tract home, with plastic covers on the furniture \u2014 is funny and endearing. Scott Ward Abernethy is obviously having a blast channeling Audrey\u2019s sadistic-dentist boyfriend, as well as assorted cameo figures, and Robert John Biedermann dodders aptly as the shop\u2019s cantankerous owner, Mr. Mushnik.\n\nBut the kooky world in which these characters move doesn\u2019t feel particularly fresh or essential. The proceedings do perk up when the three street urchins \u2014 Chiffon, Crystal and Ronnette (the lively Selena Clyne-Galindo, Chani Wereley and Alana S. Thomas) \u2014 hold forth. Brash and opinionated, this trio often functions as a piquant Greek chorus, sometimes dressed in outfits that evoke the Supremes, with vamping gestures to match. (Frank Labovitz is the costume designer; Ilona Kessell choreographed.)\n\nAt one point, a brief but delectable sight gag has the street urchins deadpanning through a window, wearing sunglasses, while Seymour sings about a solar eclipse. The fleeting bit of business calls to mind the simple, inventive staging techniques (onstage musicians, colorful pageantry) that have allowed previous Constellation productions to create a sense of wonder and expansiveness on a pocket-size scale. Puppetry aside, no such feat has been realized in \u201cLittle Shop,\u201d whose scenic design is by A.J. Guban: The Skid Row street the urchins prowl, and the adjacent flower shop, look as if they\u2019ve come out of a can.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven leaving aside its more successful performances and moments, the show\u2019s campy humor and tongue-in-cheek sci-fi story will hit the right monster-mash buttons for some audiences as Halloween approaches. But to supply a wholly satisfying artistic experience \u2014 and to show why \u201cLittle Shop\u201d is a must-see perennial \u2014 this production would need more theatrical Miracle-Gro.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors, book and lyrics by Howard Ashman, music by Alan Menken.
