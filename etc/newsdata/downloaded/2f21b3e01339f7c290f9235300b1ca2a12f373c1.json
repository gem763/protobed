He\u2019s stronger than he looks.\n\nThe Biebers were joined by Kendall Jenner and A$AP Rocky for the campaign (Picture: Calvin Klein)\n\nKendall \u2013 along with Kylie Jenner, Jaden Smith and Scooter Braun \u2013 also attended the Biebers\u2019 second wedding in South Carolina.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver 150 guests attended the event at the 20,000 acre resort where rooms apparently cost $1,000 (\u00a3800) a night.\n\nMoney obviously an issue in their luscious lives as Justin recently shared the scratch Hailey caused on his Lamborghini.\n\nHailey managed to scratch the wheels of Justin\u2019s pink Lamborghini, however, luckily, he doesn\u2019t seem to be too fussed by the whole ordeal.\n\nIn fact, he decided to take the opportunity to joke about it. Taking to Instagram stories, the singer shared a series of videos as he playfully moaned at his wife for ruining his vehicle.\u2018What did you do? What did you do?\u2019 he questioned.\n\nHailey subsequently apologised, as she stressed that she could \u2018fix\u2019 the problem while looking down at the damage done to which her partner cheekily responded: \u2018Dang, you\u2019re freaking cute, and you\u2019ve got pigtails\u2019, as he played with her hair.\n\nAdorable (Picture: Calvin Klein)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a bad scratch,\u2019 Hailey reassured her husband.\n\nIt must feel great to be able to accidentally scratch somebody\u2019s Lamborghini and not worry about paying the person a worrying amount of money.\n\nWe doubt Justin will ever get mad at Hailey considering how in love the two are.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
