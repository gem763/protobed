We should have learned that lesson after killing Osama bin Laden, after which Al Qaeda continued to expand globally.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State has its roots in Al Qaeda in Iraq, a deadly radical Sunni group founded in the early years of the Iraq war by Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi. In June 2006, Mr. Al-Zarqawi was killed in a safe house by American bombs, but his group continued its devastating violence in Iraq, and the civil war worsened over the next year. Years later, Mr. al-Baghdadi, after a weak period for the group, transformed the organization into the Islamic State, with the help of officials once loyal to Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe American commando raid took place on Saturday in Idlib Province, hundreds of miles from the area along the Syrian-Iraqi border where Mr. al-Baghdadi had been believed to be hiding, according to senior officials. Counterterrorism experts expressed surprise that Mr. al-Baghdadi was hiding in an area dominated by Al Qaeda groups so far from his strongholds.\n\nHowever, the Islamic State has extensively penetrated Idlib Province since the fall of Raqqa , its stronghold in northeastern Syria, in late 2017 . The American operation on Saturday took place in a smuggling area near the Turkish border where numerous ISIS foreign fighters have likely traversed, Ms. Cafarella said.", "description": "President Trump said in a nationally televised address that American forces targeted Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the Islamic State, in an operation in Syria this weekend.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Eric Schmitt", "Helene Cooper"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/us/politics/27DC-prexy9/27DC-prexy9-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
