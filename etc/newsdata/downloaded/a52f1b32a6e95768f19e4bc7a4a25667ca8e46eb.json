I\u2019d like to at least learn enough of a programming language to create some basic automations \u2014 or figure out some neat ways to control the various LED lighting kits I own.\n\nWhile there are plenty of options you can use (paid and free) to get started in coding, Microsoft is adding another big batch of free instructional videos to the pile. The company has uploaded a 44-part series (!) to YouTube dubbed \u201cPython for Beginners,\u201d which you can watch to get yourself familiar with the programming language.\n\nEach video is anywhere from three to ten minutes long, the perfect length to watch when you\u2019re on a conference call (wishing you had a better job), eating your lunch, or feel like procrastinating a bit. Since they\u2019re so easily digestible, they\u2019re great for watching a few times over in case you aren\u2019t quite getting whatever concept Microsoft is trying to share. (And you can always ask questions in the YouTube comments, assuming you don\u2019t mind wading through the typical mess that is YouTube comments.)\n\nMicrosoft also has a separate GitHub page you can check out, if you want more help, instruction, or code samples to play with. While coding might seem a bit out there for those who have never really dabbled before, it\u2019s entirely possible to teach yourself the basics\u2014you just have to take the time to try.", "description": "I\u2019ve always wanted to learn how to code.
