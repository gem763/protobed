(Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\nMark Hamill has made no secret of his disdain for Donald Trump. But some are accusing the Star Wars actor of crossing the line by firing back at first daughter Ivanka Trump and her family.\n\nOn Sunday, Hamill, famed for playing Luke Skywalker in the film franchise, responded to an Instagram photo of Trump with husband Jared Kushner and their three children, the youngest of whom, Theodore, is seen showing off his Star Wars love by rocking a Stormtrooper costume.\n\n\u201cThe Force is strong in my family,\u201d the proud mom joked \u2014 but a certain cinematic Jedi disagrees.\n\nHamill took to Twitter to shut down Trump, writing, \u201cYou misspelled \u2018Fraud.\u2019\u201d He added the hashtag #GoForceYourself for good measure.\n\nBut many felt his tweet went too far and accused him of turning \u201cto the dark side\u201d by picking on a kid.\n\nway to attack a child \u2014 Daddy Brutus Beefdick is Corn Pop (@iamabadman) September 29, 2019\n\nGoddamn, Mr. Hamill.

Some fans defended Hamill\u2019s stance by arguing that the Trump grandchildren are fair game given the treatment of migrant children at the border, an issue that has resulted in the frequent trolling of the first daughter\u2019s family posts.\n\nand how about the Kids who can't have \u00e0 nice Sunday because of her family ? \u2014 Supernad (@NightwingNad) September 29, 2019\n\nMommy, why does Luke Skywalker hate us?\n\nBecause we are terrible, terrible people, son. \u2014 Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) September 29, 2019\n\nThis made me happy.
