That decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, left open the ability of state courts to rule on partisan gerrymanders under state constitutions, and that was the basis for Tuesday\u2019s decision.\n\nA three-judge Superior Court panel based in Wake County found that a Republican legislative majority in 2017 drew state district lines with \u201csurgical precision\u201d to dilute the strength of Democratic voters and perpetuate GOP power.\n\n\u201cThe effect of these carefully crafted partisan maps is that, in all but the most unusual election scenarios, the Republican party will control a majority of both chambers of the General Assembly,\u201d the court wrote.\n\nThe decision relied heavily on a provision of the North Carolina Constitution that guarantees free elections. That provision provides \u201cthat all elections must be conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the people,\u201d the court said.\n\nSome 30 states have a constitutional requirement for free elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court cited its own free-elections clause last year when it invalidated the state\u2019s congressional map as a Republican gerrymander. The court imposed a new map that improved Democrats\u2019 electoral prospects.\n\nA map of North Carolina districts was shown during the trial in Raleigh in July.

The decision split the court along ideological lines, with the court\u2019s conservative majority concluding that federal courts had no constitutional authority to reallocate political power between the two major political parties and no legal standards for deciding how much partisanship is too much in redistricting.\n\n\u2014Jess Bravin contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "description": "A panel of state-court judges struck down North Carolina\u2019s legislative districts, ruling that Republicans improperly gerrymandered state voting lines to provide an enduring political majority for the GOP.", "authors": ["Brent Kendall"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103697/social"}
