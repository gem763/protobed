Niu's mother wanted him to become a government official, while his father hoped he would take over the family business in later life. As a young man, Niu attended the best school and was an obedient student. But contrary to his parent's wishes, Niu learned very little and struggled with the social environment.", "description": "After the success of plays like Divorce and Cat Country, Fang Xu's latest adaptation of another Lao She novel is ready to take center stage, Chen Nan reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db637b6a310cf3e97a323de.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
