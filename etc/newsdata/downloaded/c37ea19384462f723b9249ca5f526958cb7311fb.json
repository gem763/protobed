We can go over here in [Sevier County Sheriff] Hoss's jail and get better people,\" Sevier County Commissioner Warren Hurst said at a meeting about gun restrictions, according to video from WVLT-TV. \"We got a queer running for president, if that ain't about as ugly as you can get,\" he added.\n\nHurst did not name Buttigieg directly \u2014 but the mayor is the only openly gay Democrat in the 2020 race for the White House.\n\nOne woman stood up to rebuke Hurst for his comments. \"Excuse me\" she said. \"This is not professional. This is [expletive].\"\n\nThe woman, chair of the Sevier County Democrats Sara Thompson, then left the meeting.\n\n\"I was actually incensed. I think that was a very demeaning and nasty thing to even talk about,\" she told WVLT-TV on Tuesday.\n\nSevier County Commissioner Warren Hurst seen in a meeting Monday, October, 21, 2019.

But many in Tennessee criticized his words.\n\nHurst's fellow commissioner, Greg Haggard, told WVLT-TV that \"Commissioner Hurst's comments do not speak for the rest of the county commission.\" Representatives from nearby cities also spoke out, telling WVLT-TV that Hurst's comments were \"offensive\" and \"disturbing.\"\n\nA representative from the Tennessee Equality Project called for Hurst's resignation, and encouraged locals to attend the next meeting in protest.", "description": "Sevier County Commissioner Warren Hurst's comments drew criticism from some, but laughter and applause from others", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/23/abae4274-e919-496c-914f-2e1ef7ac77a6/thumbnail/1200x630/9f1a55bd272ebe69da401dc7222af6ba/screen-shot-2019-10-22-at-8-20-31-pm.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
