Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nMy husband was a man who loved another man \u2014 me. To argue that his firing doesn't violate employment protections against sex discrimination is absurd.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the day Don called me in 2010 and told me he had been fired. He was so upset. Don Zarda was a skydiving instructor, and he had moved to Long Island for the summer season to work at a jump zone owned by Altitude Express. Skydiving was Don\u2019s passion \u2014 when the two of us met, he took me on my first jump less than a day later.\n\nDon was fired after a customer learned he was gay \u2014 and then complained to Altitude Express about it. Next week, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that will decide whether it was legal to strip Don of his job because of his sexual orientation.\n\nDon\u2019s ordeal started when he completed a tandem skydive with a woman who signed up with her boyfriend. During a tandem skydive, the instructor and passenger are strapped very tightly together at the shoulders, chest and hips. In an attempt to reassure his customer about the close contact, Don told her that he was gay and had a husband in Texas to prove it. Don thought nothing of the comment, but a few days later he was suspended without pay. Don\u2019s boss told him it was inappropriate for him to share with customers facts about his personal life \u2014 the fact that he had husband and not a wife.\n\nLegally sanctioned discrimination?\n\nThe psychological toll that being fired took on Don was tremendous. The financial consequences were also severe \u2014 skydiving instructors work seasonally, and losing much of the summer\u2019s worth of income was devastating. It led to credit card debt and an inability to take college classes he had planned on.\n\nDon and I had been together for more than 10 years at that point. He cared about humanity, and he cared about doing things right. He was the most honest person I\u2019ve ever met, a sweet man who loved animals and was always kind to people. Tragically, in 2014, he died during a BASE jumping accident.\n\nDiscrimination is far from dead: Our same-sex marriage didn't protect us from housing discrimination that broke our hearts\n\nBut before Don passed away, he filed a suit against Altitude Express, hoping for justice. Don did not live long enough to see his day in court. Now, years later, his case has made it all the way to the Supreme Court. Along with another case of a man who was fired for being gay in Georgia, Don\u2019s case will determine whether or not it is legal for employers in the United States to terminate an employee on the simple basis of being LGBTQ.\n\nDon Zarda, top, and William Moore skydive for the first time together outside of Dallas in September 2000. (Photo: Family handout)\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating and painful that we are still having this debate in 2019, yet here we are. And the stakes could not be higher. The case revolves around Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of \u201crace, color, religion, sex and national origin.\u201d Altitude Express \u2014 and the Trump administration, which has submitted a brief to the Supreme Court \u2014 is arguing that firing Don because of his sexual orientation wasn\u2019t related to his sex and therefore should be legal under Title VII.\n\nThis is, of course, absurd. It was Don\u2019s sex that was the very basis of Altitude Express\u2019 homophobia and cruelty. It was not the mere fact that he loved a man that led to his firing; it was the fact that he was a man who loved another man. If he had been a woman who loved a man, he would not have been fired.\n\nLGBTQ struggle for full equality\n\nLGBTQ people in America have been fighting for our rights my entire life. Each step of the way, opponents of equality have pushed back on our struggle to be respected and treated with dignity. Don\u2019s case is a continuation of that struggle. Too many of my friends still have to live in fear in their workplace, hiding who they are from their colleagues and superiors, changing their pronouns at work, their livelihood dependent on how well they wear masks that they should have been able to discard years ago.\n\nMeaning of 'sex' can change everything: Transgender athletes deserve compassion, but not the right to transform women's sports\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules that Title VII does not protect us from this kind of discrimination, as this administration hopes it will, it will set a precedent that discrimination against LGBTQ people in the workplace is legal. This means that any employers who want to shun us and prevent us from actualizing our talents will have the blessings of U.S. law. It is imperative the court does not sanction prejudice in that way. The consequences would be dire.\n\nI am tired. I miss Don, and I think about him every day. This case continues to dredge up painful memories. But I know how important it is, and how much Don would want me to keep fighting not just on his behalf, but on behalf of all the LGBTQ people in this country for whom workplaces remain unsafe and inhospitable. It would be life-changing for so many people to be able to stop worrying and know they can simply be themselves.\n\nSome people think that after we were given the right to marry, discrimination against us vanished. Nothing could be further from the truth. Here we are, still having to fight. And this is a battle we have to win. Don deserved better, and so do we all.\n\nWilliam A. Moore is a the owner of Advanced Skin Fitness medical spas in Dallas. After the death of his former partner, Don Zarda, Moore has moved the case forward as part of the estate of Don Zarda.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
