In short order, a second damaging image surfaced: one of Trudeau performing \u201cDay-O\u201d in a high school talent show wearing an afro and blackface.\n\nThen within 12 hours, a video surfaced of Trudeau, again in blackface. The grainy footage from the early 1990s shows Trudeau thrusting his arms in the air while wearing makeup to darken his face and arms, confirmed to be authentic by his campaign.\n\n\u201cIt is something absolutely unacceptable to do,\u201d said Trudeau on Thursday in his second apology. \u201cIt is something that people who live with the kind of discrimination that far too many people do \u2014 because of the color of their skin or their history, or their origins, or their language or their religion \u2014 face on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t see that from the layers of privilege that I have and for that I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nThe unexpected bombshell threw Canada, and its upcoming federal election, into the spotlight, shocking people around the world and challenging Trudeau\u2019s famous reputation as an inclusive, progressive leader.\n\n\u201cI think one of the ways the shock factor has increased in all of this is Canada has constructed itself both nationally and individually on the premise of the good Canadian, the good Canada,\u201d said Kathy Hogarth, a Black Canadian, anti-racism activist and professor at the University of Waterloo.\n\n\u201cWhen these things happen, it really flies in the face and betrays that notion.\u201d\n\nCanadian Press Photos have emerged of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau dressed up in brown or blackface on three occasions.\n\nPolitical strategist Zain Velji, a Muslim, said seeing the racist photos of Trudeau \u201cdoesn\u2019t compute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man spent so much of his political capital on diversity and inclusiveness and people are having a tough time reconciling with it,\u201d Velji said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he come out and talk about it earlier?\u201d\n\nThis is the first time in a Canadian election a racialized person has vied for the prime minister\u2019s job.\n\nJagmeet Singh, leader of the left-wing New Democractic Party and son of Punjabi immigrants, gave a heartfelt statement Wednesday about the photos of Trudeau.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to all of the kids out there, all the folks who lived this and are now grown up and still feeling the pain of racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to know that you might feel like giving up on Canada. You might feel like giving up on yourselves. I want you to know that you have value, you have worth, and you are loved.\u201d\n\nAdrian Wyld/Canadian Press NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh responds to questions from the media after a town hall in Toronto on Sept. 18, 2019.\n\nStories about the photos were placed prominently on the homepages of The New York Times, BBC, Al Jazeera and The Guardian on Thursday. The front page of the Washington Post\u2019s website featured an opinion piece with the headline \u201cCanada\u2019s left should dump Justin Trudeau.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times described the \u201ccompounding scandal\u201d as a \u201cmajor blow\u201d to the image of Trudeau that he and his team meticulously shaped as a \u201cglittering spokesman for the world\u2019s beleaguered liberals.\u201d\n\nSince coming to power in 2015, Trudeau has been a favourite subject of international media, especially in the U.S. where the image of him contrasts well against the polarizing President Donald Trump.\n\nJust one month after he was sworn in as prime minister, Trudeau and his wife were photographed for Vogue. Months later, he was profiled on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d And in 2017, Rolling Stone magazine famously put the prime minister on the cover, lauded him as \u201cthe North Star\u201d and asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t he be our president?\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. President Barack Obama even joked, as he was leaving office, that Trudeau was taking over as the handsome, charming politician of \u201cthe future.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, helped solidify Canada\u2019s identity as a diverse society in 1971 by declaring the federal government would adopt a multicultural policy. Trudeau himself has welcomed almost 60,000 Syrian refugees since 2015. He apologized for how the government has treated Indigenous people and the LGBTQ community. He also made his cabinet gender equal \u201cbecause it\u2019s 2015,\u201d he stated in a widely quoted moment shortly after he took office.\n\nBut he has been criticized for not taking more meaningful actions with respect to Indigenous rights and to combat racism, among other issues.\n\n\u201cSometimes his words didn\u2019t add up to his actions, and a number of policies he heralded were pushed aside, or were quite watered down,\u201d said Brittany Andrew-Amofah, senior policy analyst at the Broadbent Institute, a progressive research organization. She pointed to him falling short on climate change action and not issuing expungements for cannabis convictions, which largely affects marginalized communities.\n\nThe racism scandal could ruin Trudeau\u2019s chances at re-election (he\u2019s refused to step down as Liberal leader). With a month left in the election campaign, he is running in a tight race against Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer. One poll from early September gave the Conservatives a two-point lead.\n\nSometimes his words didn\u2019t add up to his actions, and a number of policies he heralded were pushed aside, or were quite watered down. Brittany Andrew-Amofah\n\nUntil February, it looked like Trudeau would easily win a majority government for a second term, but his popularity took a slide after the SNC-Lavalin controversy began dominating headlines in the Canadian media. One of Trudeau\u2019s most respected ministers, former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, said the Prime Minister\u2019s Office pressured her to help the corporation avoid prosecution for corruption charges.\n\nWilson-Raybould, who was the highest-ranking Indigenous woman in a Canadian government ever, was eventually booted from the Liberal party \u2014 another indication that Trudeau\u2019s actions differ from his words of inclusivity.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shown a pattern of troubling behaviour towards those who are racially different,\u201d said Hogarth. \u201cHow he treated Jody Wilson-Raybold raised red flags for me.\u201d\n\nThe former attorney general herself weighed in on the racist photo scandal Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful,\u201d Wilson-Raybould said. \u201cWhen I first saw it, I didn\u2019t think it was real...\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud to be an Indigenous person in this country, one that has experienced racism and discrimination. It\u2019s completely unacceptable for anybody in a position of authority and power to do something like that.\u201d\n\nBrown and blackface are traditionally worn by white people, often in theatre, \u201cto simplify and demean people of color,\u201d said Hogarth, the University of Waterloo professor.\n\n\u201c(It) harkens back to a history of racism and an Orientalist mythology, which is unacceptable,\u201d said the National Council of Canadian Muslims executive director Mustafa Farooq in a statement.\n\nBlackface became a popular, racist form of entertainment in the U.S. in the 1820s, but has a long history in Canada, too. They are countries founded on slavery and the erasure of Indigenous people, with white people empowered through politics, the economy and social stratification, said Andrew-Amofah.\n\nIn this environment, \u201cblackface rose in popularity to portray Black people as less than,\u201d she said.\n\nMcGill University has tracked almost 350 instances of blackface in Canada between 1841 to 2016 \u2014 from the composer of the Canadian national anthem traveling as a blackface minstrel in the mid-1800s, to \u201cBlack Pete\u201d being welcomed at an Edmonton bakery just a couple of years ago.\n\nBefore the scandal, the vast majority of Canadians believed Trudeau was more tolerant, compassionate and influential compared to Scheer, his main political opponent, according to a recent poll.\n\n\u201cHe (Trudeau) had built up a tremendous base and foundation of goodwill,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director of the polling firm Angus Reid Institute. \u201cThe question becomes does that deep base enable him to survive this, or is it more damaging?\u201d\n\nHe had built up a tremendous base and foundation of goodwill. Shachi Kurl\n\nThis scandal could devastate the support Trudeau draws from progressive voters, whom he rallied under the Liberal\u2019s \u201cbig red tent\u201d last election, leading to his unexpected victory, she said.\n\nHis promises of \u201csunny ways\u201d and change compelled them to get out and vote.\n\n\u201cNothing in the last 24 hours is helpful on either fronts,\u201d Kurl said. \u201cIf the progressive left cannot bring themselves to forgive Justin Trudeau, what happens? Do they drift away, and stay home?\u201d\n\nVoters might be less critical, however, in Quebec \u2014 a predominantly French-speaking, vote-rich province that has been consistently influential in determining the outcome of Canadian elections.\n\nAlready, the scandal has garnered less media attention there. Three Quebec newspapers in its provincial capital covered their Thursday editions with stories about a C\u00e9line Dion concert. A fourth featured a photo of new elephants at the zoo.\n\nThe province\u2019s leader, Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault, said that the costumes were a bad choice when he was speaking in English but would not repeat that comment in French, according to CBC News reporter Jay Turnbull.\n\nPremier Legault said that the prime minister has apologized, \u201cso I think we have to talk about something else now.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has been criticized for not speaking out more strongly against Quebec\u2019s popular but controversial law, which bans anyone who wears a religious symbol, like a hijab, kippah or turban, from public sector jobs.\n\nHe has said he opposes the law, but he\u2019s also said his federal government won\u2019t do anything to stop it. More than 60% of Quebecers support the \u201csecularism\u201d law, polls have found. And Trudeau enjoys higher levels of support in Quebec than he does in other areas of the country.\n\nCanadians now have to weigh his racist actions of the past against his record as prime minister, said Velji, the political strategist. \u201cDo these photos and video define him and everything else as BS, or has he shown enough with his record we can chalk it up to youthful ignorance?\u201d", "description": "The scandal has thrown Canada, and its upcoming election, into the spotlight, challenging Trudeau\u2019s famous reputation as an inclusive, progressive leader.", "authors": ["Reporter", "Huffpost Canada", "Associate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d84933e2300005600cf655c.jpeg?cache=lxrdtvi935&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
