It would have prohibited a woman from aborting a fetus because it had a disability, such as Down syndrome.\n\nRepresentative Holli Sullivan called it a \u201cdangerous\u201d plan that could compel women to lie to their doctors. Her colleague Wendy McNamara warned of a return to \u201cback-room abortions.\u201d Another, Cindy Ziemke, said it was a case of government overreach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for me to have to vote no on a pro-life bill,\u201d Ms. Ziemke said in emotional remarks in March. \u201cI have never had to do that before. I never thought I would ever have to.\u201d", "description": "Mr. Pence\u2019s reputation as a longstanding, implacable and dogged opponent of abortion has made him a hero to the country\u2019s cultural conservatives.", "authors": ["Monica Davey", "Michael Barbaro"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/17/us/17ABORTION/17ABORTION-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2016-07-17"}
