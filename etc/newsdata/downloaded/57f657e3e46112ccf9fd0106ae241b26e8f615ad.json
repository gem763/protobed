Following in the footsteps of companies like Netflix, Samsung \u2014 heck, even Arby\u2019s \u2014 Smalls has partnered with Oslo-based type foundry Good Type to create a font called Adieu Smalls.\n\nThe curvy font builds on Good Type\u2019s Adieu as a base, but it takes inspiration from the way cats curl their tails to express emotions. \u201cWhen a cat expresses interest, they form a slight hook at the tip of their tail. We applied this in the form of hooked tips to the \u2018U\u2019 and \u2018E\u2019 that break out of the ascender and descender of the characters,\u201d Smalls lead designer Miles Barretto told Fast Company. \u201cWhen a cat expresses pleasure, the tail quivers. You can see in \u2018M\u2019 and \u2018O\u2019 there is a similar state of playfulness.\u201d\n\nCustomers will be able to see Adieu Smalls in action on the company\u2019s website, packaging, and its upcoming zine Small Talk. According to DesignWeek, the zine is meant to be a print accompaniment to the brand\u2019s blog. It\u2019ll feature customers\u2019 cats in photoshoots, and it may be included in some shipments a surprise add-on. As one would expect from a cat food startup, the zine is extremely design-forward, like if all the cats had a membership to The Wing.\n\nThere\u2019s already an abundance of cat-inspired fonts out there, most of which play on cats\u2019 liquid-like bodies to create the shapes. But Adieu Smalls aims to elevate the overall aesthetic of the cat font. \u201cToday, cats are too often associated with social memes,\u201d Barretto continues. \u201cThere is a deep and rich history of the celebration and reverence of felines in many cultures\u2014take Maneki-neko in Japan or the goddess Bastet in ancient Egypt as but two examples.\u201d", "description": "Cat food company Smalls partnered with Oslo-based type foundry Good Type to create a font inspired by cat tails.
