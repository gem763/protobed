Multiple factors are promoting the sentiments of the overall market. US Federal Reserve is expected to announce a rate cut during its meeting today, which is considered a significant boost to the global markets, including India. However, if the Fed sounds dovish for its policy outlook and indicates that it is near the end of the rate-cutting cycle, the markets could disappoint tomorrow.\n\nThe markets also got a boost from the easing US-China trade tensions when Washington said that it was close to finalizing the trade deal with China. However, there was some disappointment today when the US said that it would take it more time to sign the agreement, which means it will not be ready to sign in it's meeting with China in Chile next month.\n\nNevertheless, a further US monetary policy loosening and easing trade tensions boosted investor\u2019s confidence.\n\nThere was some positive news back home as well, which was also instrumental in pushing Nifty up. According to news agency IANS, the government is working on revamping the income tax structure on equities. This means the government may lower or scrap the dividend distribution tax (DDT), the securities transaction tax (STT), and long term capital gains tax (LTCG). It came as a big sentiment boost to the investor community.\n\nTalking about the stock-specific action, Tata Motors (NS: ) stock jumped by more than 16% in yesterday\u2019s trade. Tata Motors posted better than expected profits when it announced its earnings results for the latest quarter. JLR sales in China improved, while lower costs resulting from lower commodity costs and cutting of the workforce also boosted the profits for the company.\n\nOn the other hand, Bharti Airtel Ltd. (NS: ) stock declined by more than 3% as the company deferred the announcement of its quarterly results, saying that it needs more time to assess the Supreme Court order for Airtel to pay more than Rs. 21,000 crores to the government for the pending license fee. Vodafone\u2019s stock also declined by 8% yesterday after nosediving by 23% on Friday. Vodafone (LON: ) has also been asked by Supreme Court to pay Rs. 20,000 crores to the centre.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Vodafone Group PLC, Nifty 50, Bharti Airtel Ltd., Tata Motors Ltd.
