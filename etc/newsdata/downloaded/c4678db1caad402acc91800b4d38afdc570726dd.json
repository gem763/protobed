It was a rewarding experience to work on this project, and we are proud to have supported BT in achieving this milestone.'", "description": "The event was held at Wembley by the telecommunications company BT and the use of 160 drones broke a record for the most to have been controlled by the same computer.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20043904-0-image-a-39_1571760563623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
