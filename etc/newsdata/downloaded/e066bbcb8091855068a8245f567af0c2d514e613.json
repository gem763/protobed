The video shows a female jogger taking a dump right beside a Sweaty Betty PR Sydney office, in broad daylight.\n\nThe clips show the woman running behind the car, probably thinking no one was watching her on the Watson Street in Paddington, then pulling down her pants to relieve herself. This happened on two different occasions.\n\nThe two videos showing the jogger defecating in public are separate. Reportedly, Jacenko has been finding feces on the street for three weeks now.\n\n\u201cIt's disgusting, it's a lovely street lined with heritage terraces, kids playing and riding their bikes. Human feces shouldn't be on any street,\u201d Daily Mail quoted Jacenko as saying.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss 2.2 K SHARES 10.9 K SHARES\n\nRoxy is a 39-year-old celebrity publicist and seems pretty determined to identify the culprit. That is why she has shared the videos on all her social media accounts, to get as much public assistance as possible.\n\n'What an absolute disgrace you are, doing this in our residential street where we have a primary school and multiple residences', she wrote in one of her posts.\n\nTalking about what to do about the woman, she reportedly said, \u201cThe neighbors and I will all discuss it and make a decision. The fact is no one should have to walk through or past human faeces to enter their home or place of work.\u201d\n\nShe further said, \u201cWe will be hosing away today's mess tomorrow... I think I would hose her given the chance!\u201d\n\nOne resident who wished to remain anonymous reportedly said, \u201cThe poos have come more consistently recently. But I hope the woman isn't shamed as she could possibly have a medical condition.\u201d\n\nWell, if it is a medical condition then it is entirely a different matter and the woman should get herself some help, but if its not, why on earth would anyone poop in the middle of the street if they can help it?!", "description": "Facebook user Roxy Jacenko shared shocking and disgusting videos that are increasingly going viral.
