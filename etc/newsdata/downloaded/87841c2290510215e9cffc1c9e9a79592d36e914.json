More than 800 March for Our Lives events, organized by survivors of the Parkland, Florida school shooting.\n\nFive children were shot in four separate incidents over the weekend in Texas, highlighting a sobering statistic for a state already struggling with gun violence: Texas ranks first in the nation for unintentional shootings involving children.\n\nAuthorities said the spate of shootings included a 4-year-old boy who was shot and killed by his 5-year-old brother; a 6-year-old who was shot with a rifle by his adolescent brother; a 3-year-old who was possibly grazed by a bullet, an 8-year-old who sat on a semiautomatic handgun; and a 14-year-old girl who was reportedly being treated for injuries, according to CBS 11.\n\nThese shootings evidence a parallel problem of youth gun violence in a state that has already been devastated by several mass shootings in 2019, including one of the nation\u2019s deadliest ever, in El Paso in August.\n\nPrior to that shooting, Texas already led the nation in unintentional shootings by children, according to a report by the Houston Chronicle that cited data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control advocacy group.
