The Aramco sites are around 800 miles from the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border. Iran\u2019s hard-line Revolutionary Guard Corps in the past has supplied the Houthis with weaponry including drones and components for ballistic missiles.\n\nBut one thing is clear. The attack revealed the limits of Saudi Arabia\u2019s seemingly sophisticated air-defense system. Riyadh in recent years has spent billions of dollars building up six battalions of U.S.-made Patriot surface-to-air missiles and associated radars. The Patriots didn\u2019t stop the recent attack.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t the first time Saudi Arabia\u2019s Patriots have failed. At least five Patriots apparently missed, malfunctioned or otherwise failed when Saudi forces tried to intercept a barrage of rockets targeting Riyadh on March 25, 2018.\n\nHouthi forces fired at least seven rockets at Saudi Arabia that night. The Saudi military launched Patriot Advanced Capability-2 missiles in an attempt to destroy the Houthi rockets in mid-air. The Saudis claimed seven of the Patriots struck their targets.\n\nOne man reportedly died after being struck by metal fragments. It's unclear whether the fragments came from a malfunctioning Patriot, a successful intercept or a Houthi rockets striking the ground.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "One thing is clear: The attack revealed the limits of Saudi Arabia\u2019s seemingly sophisticated air-defense system.
