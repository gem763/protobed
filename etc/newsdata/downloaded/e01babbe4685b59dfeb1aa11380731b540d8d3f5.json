Hard to know, experts say", "language": "en", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Millions of Californians spent part of the week in the dark in an unprecedented effort by the state\u2019s large electrical utilities to prevent another devastating wildfire. It was the fifth time Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has pre-emptively cut the power but by far the largest to date in the utility\u2019s effort to prevent a deadly wildfire sparked by its power lines.\n\nBut do the power shut-offs actually prevent fires?\n\nExperts say it\u2019s hard to know what might have happened had the power stayed on, or if the utility\u2019s proactive shutoffs are to thank for California\u2019s mild fire season this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to prove a negative,\u201d said Alan Scheller-Wolf, professor of operations management and an energy expert at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Tepper School of Business. \u201cThey can\u2019t prove they prevented a disaster because there\u2019s no alternative universe where they didn\u2019t try this.\u201d\n\nThe winds that prompted the mass outage that affected nearly 2 million people in northern and central parts of the state shifted southward by Friday, where a wind-fueled wildfire prompted officials to order the evacuation of 100,000 people from their homes in foothills of the San Fernando Valley.\n\nCalifornia is experiencing the first major fire activity of the season after two years that brought some of the most devastating fires on record, many of them caused by utility equipment. Until Monday, fires had covered only about 5% of the acreage burned by that date last year, and only about 13% of the average for the last five years.\n\nBut it\u2019s too early \u2014 and maybe impossible \u2014 to tell if that can be attributed to increased measures to cut power.\n\n\u201cWe have good reason to be skeptical, and the reason is that PG&E bears the costs of starting a fire, but they don\u2019t bear the costs of shutting off power,\u201d said Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business.\n\nHe noted that weather forecasting is notoriously difficult, \u201cso even if PG&E were doing the best possible job, it would not get it right sometimes.\u201d\n\nPG&E said in a statement that employees located 23 spots where parts of its systems were damaged during the strong winds, but officials have declined to provide details, saying it will be included in a state-mandated report.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom blasted PG&E for what he called decades of mismanagement, underinvestment and lousy communication with the public. He pointed to San Diego Gas & Electric, which pioneered proactive power shutoffs following a devastating 2007 fire sparked by its equipment, as a model for responsibly shutting off power in bad weather.\n\n\u201cSpecifically as it relates to their predictive analysis, their weather station, I had a chance to visit it a few months ago,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s exceptional, it\u2019s at another level.\u201d\n\nSDG&E, which serves 3.6 million people, has spent about $1.5 billion to better predict bad weather and update its equipment, said Chief Operating Officer Caroline Winn. The company hired meteorologists, data scientists and fire experts and deployed an extensive array of weather monitors, she said. It replaced about 18,000 wooden poles with steel, installed new conductors and increased the wind tolerance in remote areas, using data from weather sensors to know which equipment was most at risk. The company also sectionalized electrical circuits so power managers could target outages more precisely to the lines facing danger.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have all the answers then, but what we did know as we had to change and we had to do things differently,\u201d Winn said.\n\nA decade of data and the refined grid have helped SDG&E to narrowly target outages when they\u2019re necessary, she said. Of its 14 outages since 2013, only two affected more than 20,000 customers and most have been significantly fewer.\n\nOutside California, other large western utilities in Nevada and Utah said they, too, are considering proactively shutting off power to avoid sparking fires.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure our system isn\u2019t the cause of one of these devastating fires,\u201d said Tiffany Erickson, a spokeswoman for Rocky Mountain Power in Utah, which has notified 5,000 households and businesses that shutoffs are possible during dangerous weather.\n\nLast month, Southern California Edison shut off electricity to 14,000 customers in the remote Mammoth Lakes area along the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada because of forecasts of extreme winds and extremely dry vegetation.\n\nWinds reached 88 mph (141 kph) and the California Highway Patrol banned trucks and campers from traveling along a highway after gusts blew over big-rig trucks, the utility said. The winds knocked down power poles and damaged electric circuits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear that the conditions that were in place up there were so severe that they could likely have caused a spark to occur,\u201d said Don Daigler, a company spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this willy-nilly.\u201d\n\nStephen Pyne, a retired Arizona State University professor and fire historian, likened the power line problem to challenges posed by railroads until the early 1900s, when steam engines and train wheels regularly threw sparks that ignited deadly fires.\n\n\u201cThink about the railroads then,\u201d Pyne said. \u201cThey were enormously powerful \u2014 economically, politically, socially. And we took it on. Railroads ceased to be a source of regular or lethal emissions (of sparks.)\u201d\n\n___\n\nCooper reported from Phoenix. Associated Press writers Olga R.
