Especially since in recent days New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, among others, have publicly fretted that the president\u2019s recent effort to move our troops out of Syria would likely lead to a revival of that vicious terror organization.\n\nBut no, not even a clear win in the fight against Islamic terror registers approval from the liberal media. Hours later, the Washington Post altered their initial obituary, which described al-Baghdadi as \u201dIslamic State\u2019s terrorist-in-chief,\u201d to call him an \u201caustere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State.\u201d Sure, because heaven forbid the Trump administration actually gets rid of a bad guy and makes the world a little safer.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and others took to Twitter to deride Democrats and the media for dismissing the killing of the terrorist \u201cas no big deal\u201d and whining that they were not informed in advance. That was their response.\n\nDAN GAINOR: IMPEACH TRUMP? HECK, THE LEFT AND MEDIA WANT TO OVERTURN THE ENTIRE PRESIDENCY\n\nThis is, of course, only the most recent example of how shamefully the liberal media treats President Trump. His supporters are sick of it, and so is he.\n\nLast week, President Trump canceled the White House subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post, and encouraged other federal agencies to follow suit. It was small; it was petty. But, after three years of taking a relentless pounding from the liberal media, it must have felt good. Thousands of other fed-up Americans have done the very same thing.\n\nThe reaction of the liberal press was predictable \u2013 astonishment and outrage. How dare he? One incensed person likened the president to Mussolini; Vanity Fair\u2019s headline called him \"Angry Little Man.\"\n\nMaureen Dowd, in the Times, blasted the \u201csnowflake\u201d president for not being an ardent Times reader (unlike President Obama) and confidently predicted he\u2019ll \u201csneak back,\u201d unable to stay away.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing Ms. Dowd \u2013 you need Trump more than he needs you. We wonder what will become of the Times, and the Post, after President Trump leaves office. The half of the country offended by your offensive treatment of the man they voted for have moved on; they get their news from other sources now, sources that maybe deliver the news more fairly.\n\nThose clicks you love from your admirers will dwindle post-Trump. As you point out in your column, it is what you describe as Trump\u2019s terrible behavior that sells papers. The stories cited daily in the Times as \u201cmost read\u201d are mainly attacks on the president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTrump\u2019s exasperation with the liberal media is entirely understandable, and defensible. They have been relentless in their scathing criticism of his every word and deed from the moment he decided to run for president. Not a day goes by that the Times, for example, doesn\u2019t lash out in the most vitriolic fashion.\n\nWhy should his White House support such an organization? Why should the taxpayers who elected Donald Trump?\n\nTrump is not the only one disgusted with the media. Gallup has tracked opinion about the press over time; the most recent summary shows 28 percent of the country has no confidence at all in the mass media \u2013 a record. Another 30 percent said they had \u201cnot very much confidence\u201d that the media was reporting the news accurately and fairly. Moreover, 42 percent of those surveyed thought the national news was too liberal, against only 13 percent who saw it as too conservative.\n\nRemember that the Times' publisher was so embarrassed to have completely missed the biggest political story of recent times \u2013 Trump\u2019s victory \u2013 that he penned a sort of \"mea culpa,\" acknowledging the goof but also excusing it as the result of an \u201cerratic and unpredictable election.\u201d\n\nHe recommitted the paper to its \u201cfundamental mission,\u201d which he described as reporting \u201cAmerica and the world honestly \u2026 striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives.\u201d What nonsense. The Times makes zero effort to understand and certainly has never reflected the views of those who elected President Trump. I doubt there\u2019s a single writer on their payroll who voted for Trump.\n\n\n\nTheir antagonism of the liberal media costs the country dearly.\n\nPaul Krugman\u2019s unceasing, erroneous columns talking down the economy (\"Here Comes the Trump Slump,\" \"The Day the Trump Boom Died\") dampen optimism. Consumer sentiment has mainly, thankfully, sailed right past the ominous whisperings of the economist most notorious for predicting that Trump\u2019s election would ignite a stock market crash. But, the collective doom-and-gloom spread by Krugman and his colleagues does not move the economy, or the country, forward.\n\nThe liberal press has harped relentlessly on the bad news and refused to herald good tidings, such as the positive impact of the GOP tax cuts. The campaign against the tax overhaul began even before the bill was written, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer badmouthing it as a handout to the wealthy and the liberal press falling in line. So successful, and so damaging was the concerted coverage of the tax bill that most Americans believed their taxes had actually gone up, even as the vast majority of the country actually saw them drop.\n\nEven the Times had to admit (eventually) that taxes fell for most Americans. They credited the confusion to \u201ca sustained \u2014 and misleading \u2014 effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase.\u201d\n\nSo, the liberal media lied about the tax bill, thus blunting the optimism it might have generated.\n\n\n\nIt is also not helpful that the liberal media chooses to disparage the president every time he meets with another head of state. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping may be trying to stall on a trade deal; some have speculated that he expects the president to lose in 2020 and has decided to wait him out. Wonder where he got that idea?\n\n\n\nThe president is wrong to call the liberal media the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d but he is not wrong that their coverage of his administration is biased. It is also often wrong. They were wrong about Trump in 2016, they were wrong about the Brexit vote, and they were wrong about the Trump team colluding with Russia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe liberal media is powerful; they could use that power to good effect. For instance, if the press aggressively backed Trump\u2019s call for trade reforms from China, and used their influence to bring Americans aboard, it might speed an agreement. Or, if they are concerned about the plight of American farmers as they pretend to be, they might pressure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to move the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal to a vote.\n\nMedia elites tell us that the country is badly polarized.
