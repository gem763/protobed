She said she would go to the legislature later to get legal backing for the rule.\n\n\u201cWe must save Hong Kong, the present Hong Kong and the future Hong Kong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must stop the violence ... we can\u2019t just leave the situation to get worse and worse.\u201d\n\nLaurel Chor via Getty Images People protest a government ban on face masks in Central on October 4, 2019 in Hong Kong.

A six-month jail term could be imposed on people who refuse a police officer\u2019s order to remove a face covering for identification.\n\nMasks will be permitted for \u201clegitimate need,\u201d when their wearers can prove that they need them for work, health or religious reasons.\n\n\u201cWill they arrest 100,000 people on the street? The government is trying to intimidate us but at this moment, I don\u2019t think the people will be scared,\u201d said a protester who gave his surname as Lui.\n\nLam wouldn\u2019t rule out a further toughening of measures if violence continues. She said she would not resign because \u201cstepping down is not something that will help the situation\u201d when Hong Kong is in \u201ca very critical state of public danger.\u201d\n\nThousands of masked protesters began marching in the city\u2019s business district and other areas before Lam spoke. The rally grew in the evening as protesters vowed they wouldn\u2019t be intimidated. Some used metal railings and other objects to block roads and set street fires, including burning a Chinese flag.\n\n\u201cThe Hong Kong police are also wearing their masks when they\u2019re doing their job. And they don\u2019t show their pass and their number,\u201d said protester Ernest Ho. \u201cSo I will still keep my mask on everywhere.\u201d\n\nFace masks have become a hallmark of protesters in Hong Kong, even at peaceful marches. As the use of police tear gas has become widespread, many young protesters have worn heavier duty gear including full gas masks and goggles.\n\nEven peaceful masked marchers cite fears they could lose jobs and be denied access to schooling, public housing and other government-funded services if identified as having taken part in demonstrations.\n\nMany also are concerned their identities could be shared with the massive state-security apparatus that helps keep the Communist Party in power across the border in mainland China, where high-tech surveillance including facial recognition technology is ubiquitous.\n\nAnalysts said the use of the Emergency Ordinance set a dangerous precedent. The law, a relic of British rule enacted in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike and last used to crush riots in 1967, gives broad powers to the city\u2019s chief executive to implement regulations in an emergency.\n\n\u201cEven though the mask ban is just a small move under the Emergency Ordinance, it is a dangerous first step. If the anti-mask legislation proves to be ineffective, it could lead the way to more draconian measures such as a curfew and other infringement of civil liberties,\u201d said Willy Lam, adjunct professor at the Chinese University.\n\nAnthony Kwan via Getty Images Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam speaks during a press conference at the Central Government Complex on October 4, 2019 in Hong Kong.

She insisted she was not acting under orders from the central government in Beijing, which she visited this week when Communist Party leaders celebrated 70 years in power on Tuesday.\n\nThe ban followed widespread violence in the city Tuesday that marred China\u2019s National Day and included a police officer shooting a protester, the first victim of gunfire since the protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill. The wounded teenager was charged with attacking police and rioting.\n\nThe movement has snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing\u2019s interference in Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy. More than 1,750 people have been detained so far.\n\nActivists and many legislators have warned the mask ban could be counterproductive, impractical and difficult to enforce in a city bubbling with anger and where tens of thousands have often defied police bans on rallies.\n\nThe government last month withdrew the extradition bill, widely slammed as an example of the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom, but protesters have widened their demands to include direct elections of the city\u2019s leaders, an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, the unconditional release of protesters and not characterizing the protests as riots.\n\n\u201cFive demands, not one less!\u201d many protesters shouted during Friday\u2019s rallies as they held up five fingers.", "description": "The mask ban applies to all public gatherings, both unauthorized and those approved by police.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97316e2100005100a933c8.jpeg?cache=qn937gm0he&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
