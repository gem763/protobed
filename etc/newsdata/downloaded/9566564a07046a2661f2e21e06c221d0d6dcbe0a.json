A man in a 15-year-old Brian Urlacher Bears jersey and his friend, wearing Josh Jacobs\u2019 brand new Raiders shirt, walk shoulder-to-shoulder past a dodgy kebab shop. A family of Patriots fans pop into a Lycamobile newsagent for some water and fizzy drinks. A British woman in a Jaguars jersey jokes about sixth-round rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew with a man who\u2019s flown over from Chicago to watch his favourite team.\n\nNone of this is a strange sight in London anymore - the NFL has been embedded in a small corner of British culture for well over a decade. The difference is it now has a home.\n\nTottenham\u2019s magnificent new stadium is the first ever to be purpose built for American Football outside of the United States.\n\nWhen you look at the glistening glass exterior, emblazoned with the logos and quarterbacks of the travelling teams, with its very own NFL store and its tailgating park, you could be forgiven for thinking you\u2019re in Atlanta or Dallas, and yet the atmosphere - and the rain which fell as the crowds made their way through the turnstiles - is still distinctly British. It feels like everything the NFL has tried to bring to the UK - both the culmination of years of hard work and the first step of a giant revolution to come.\n\nThe transformation from football; English to football; American is so complete that when you take your seat it is hard to imagine Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen trotting out of the tunnel every other week. This feels like a real NFL stadium, worthy of any of the league\u2019s finest franchises. The field itself is ever present, just hidden by the retractable football pitch. There are separate, larger dressing rooms for American football, the big screens replay every down in vibrant detail and the atmosphere, with no disrespect to Wembley, was on another level to what we\u2019ve experienced in this country before.", "description": "It\u2019s 3.", "authors": ["Alex Finnis", "James Corrigan", "Daniel Schofield", "Ben Coles"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/american-football/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212248666-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oLxVMM-N2Dh3uu4C0ivbnMw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
