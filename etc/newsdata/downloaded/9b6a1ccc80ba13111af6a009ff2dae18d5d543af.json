I mean the unit economics right now are not great, Uber lost $5.2 billion last quarter, they\u2019re still not profitable on each ride,\u201d Tusk Holdings CEO and early Uber investor Bradley Tusk told the FOX Business Network\u2019s \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tusk, two things will happen if the California proposal becomes law.\n\n\u201cPrices are going to have to increase, that will mean less demand, it will mean consumers will have to pay more money,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nSecondly, in the long run it will speed up the push for autonomous vehicles to replace drivers, he said.\n\n\u201cYou might have a short-term benefit for drivers where they\u2019re covered as employees, but ultimately it\u2019s really going to push both Uber and Lyft and everyone else in the industry to try to get rid of the drivers as quickly as possible,\u201d Tusk explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, Tusk says some \"gig economy\" startups saw this coming and are ahead of the curve.\n\n\u201cHandy was a really good example of this, saw this and said why don\u2019t we offer portable benefits to the people on our platform,\u201d Tusk said.\n\nBut according to Tusk, Uber missed the boat.\n\n\u201cI think Uber put its head in the sand and didn\u2019t really deal with this for years and years when it was obviously coming,\u201d said Tusk.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "How the California gig-worker bill would potentially impact Uber and Lyft.", "authors": ["Matthew Wisner"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/UberTOP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
