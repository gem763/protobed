Well, I just found out he has a musical toilet in his brand new mega-mansion. So even if you\u2019re rich, you\u2019ll probably never be \u2018Drake\u2019s musical toilet\u2019 rich.\n\nIn a recent tour of his house posted on the TMZ YouTube channel, Drake shared a look inside his brand spankin\u2019 new property. The property is built on the $6.7 million block of land he snapped up in 2015.\n\nTo quote Drake himself, \u201cthe property started from the bottom, now it\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nThe whole place is fancy, with basketball courts and 10-car garages aplenty, but the real selling point for me is the singing toot. Who doesn\u2019t love a musical toot?\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie, the fact that Drake\u2019s toilet probably costs more than my one-bedroom apartment kind of breaks my heart. Just a little.\n\nLook at this fancy thing. This throne is simply too good for my shit.\n\nIt is unclear whether the singing feature is able to be turned off, or whether you\u2019re just stuck listening to the soothing sounds of the shitter every time you need to use the bathroom. But if you\u2019re spending this much money on a toilet that opens automatically and plays music, you probably wouldn\u2019t want to turn it off.\n\nThe toilet plays peaceful ambient music while you poop, which is honestly much less impressive than a toilet that raps Drake beats. But that\u2019s just my non-musical-toilet opinion, so who am I to judge?\n\nHonestly, if I was Champagne Papi, I\u2019d be buying a fancy singing toilet too, but his lavish Toronto home doesn\u2019t stop there. No, sir.\n\nHe has a living room complete with a fully-equipped bar, a full-sized basketball court with his custom OVO branding, and a personal closet that looks bigger than my entire apartment. And to top it all off, he has 4.4 metre-high fencing around the property that required official approval from the local council, you know, for security reasons. This place is some serious a-lister bullshit.\n\nMaybe now he can invite fellow Canadian Celine Dion over for that cup of coffee she mentioned after his tattoo fail.", "description": "Drake has shared a video of his brand new mega-mansion, complete with a full-sized basketball court and a musical toilet.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/pjimage-46.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
