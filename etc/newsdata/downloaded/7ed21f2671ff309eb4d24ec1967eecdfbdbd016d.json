Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; Rep. Eliot L. Engel, New York Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, Maryland Democrat and chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said Congress would \u201cinfer from this obstruction that any withheld documents and testimony would reveal information that corroborates the whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nAt the White House, President Trump turned up the heat on the anonymous whistleblower by saying he is entitled to confront the individual and the person who gave the whistleblower what the president characterized as \u201cfalse information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer, warmer or better,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cNo pressure at all (as confirmed by Ukrainian Pres.). It is just another Democrat Hoax!\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower, an intelligence official who was working at the White House, lodged a complaint that Mr. Trump pressed the Ukrainian president to dig up dirt on 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint is now the crux of Democrats\u2019 reinvigorated impeachment effort.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who authored many of the nation\u2019s whistleblower laws, broke with the president by saying the person who filed the complaint should be protected.\n\n\u201cWe should always work to respect whistleblowers\u2019 requests for confidentiality,\u201d Mr. Grassley said in a statement. \u201cAny further media reports on the whistleblower\u2019s identity don\u2019t serve the public interest \u2014 even if the conflict sells more papers or attracts clicks.\u201d\n\nHe also cautioned everyone against a rush to judgment.\n\n\u201cUninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn\u2019t serve the country,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump has insisted the corruption is on the part of Mr. Biden and his son.\n\nHunter Biden received $3 million for a job on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father, as vice president, pressured Ukraine in 2016 to oust a prosecutor who had been investigating the company.\n\nMr. Biden said the prosecutor wasn\u2019t pursuing corruption cases and there is no evidence that Hunter Biden was involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nIn response to Mr. Pompeo\u2019s letter, the three chairmen said he was the one intimidating witnesses.\n\n\u201cAny effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress \u2014 including State Department employees \u2014 is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry,\u201d the Democrats wrote.\n\nThe vicious exchange raised questions about whether the State Department officials will appear before Congress.\n\nThe committees subpoenaed four current State Department employees and one former diplomat.\n\nMr. Pompeo said the subpoenas, issued late Friday, left the department with no time to prepare. He did not explicitly say whether he would block officials\u2019 testimony.\n\nFormer Ukrainian ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was scheduled to testify Wednesday morning, but her deposition has been postponed until Oct. 11, according to an Intelligence Committee source.\n\nKurt Volker, the former envoy to the Ukraine, is scheduled to testify Thursday as planned. Mr. Volker resigned from his post Friday after he was named in the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe State Department inspector general on Wednesday is scheduled to brief staffers from several House and Senate committees about documents related to the department and Ukraine.\n\nThe meeting was requested by Steve Linick, the State Department inspector general, but scant details are known.\n\nMr. Trump renewed his attacks on Mr. Schiff. He suggested his critic should be arrested for \u201cfraudulently making up a statement \u2026 which was very dishonest and bad for me.\u201d\n\nDuring a congressional hearing last week, Mr. Schiff was criticized for saying the president asked the Ukrainian government to \u201cmanufacture dirt\u201d on the former vice president. Mr. Schiff repeated the claim in a television appearance over the weekend.\n\nBut the explosive claim was not part of the whistleblower complaint released last week or the official transcript of the July phone call.\n\nWhile some in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit lashed out, another key figure lawyered up. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, hired former Watergate prosecutor Jon Sale to represent him in congressional matters.\n\nHouse Democrats subpoenaed Mr. Giuliani on Monday for a trove of documents and communications related to his communications with individuals in Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani was named in the whistleblower complaint as \u201ca central figure\u201d in the effort to dig up dirt on the Bidens.\n\nMr. Sale was involved in the legal battle to obtain secret tapes from President Nixon\u2019s White House to determine whether officials engaged in criminal conduct, according to his biography on the website of his current law firm, Nelson Mullins. Based in Maimi, Mr. Sale is co-chairman of the firm\u2019s white collar and government investigations practice group.\n\nIt is not immediately clear whether Mr. Giuliani will comply with the subpoena, which requires him to turn over the materials by Oct. 14. He said Monday that the document request raises \u201csignificant issues concerning legitimacy.\u201d\n\nIn his phone call with Mr. Zelensky, the president encouraged the Ukrainian leader to connect with Mr. Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr on the Biden probe.\n\nMr. Zelesnky said Tuesday that he has had no interactions with Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\u201cI never met Rudy Giuliani \u2014 never. And never had any phone calls with him,\u201d the Ukrainian president said at a news conference in Kyiv.\n\nHe insisted he will not be pressured by the U.S. or anyone else to probe the Biden family.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel pressure,\u201d he said at the press conference. \u201cI have lots of people who\u2019d like to put pressure on me here and abroad. I\u2019m the president of an independent Ukraine \u2014 no one can put pressure on me.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
