The out patient department at Emergency Hospital in Helmand\u2019s capital Lashkar Gah was soon beyond capacity. Nurses from throughout the building rushed to assist.\n\nThe victims ranged in age from four to fifty. They\u2019d been at home on the afternoon of November 24, 2018, when two Taliban fighters entered their compound in the village of Loy Manda, in Helmand\u2019s Nad-i Ali District. Obaidullah, the patriarch of the family, pleaded with the fighters to leave, but before they did, they fired over a wall at a passing Afghan and American military convoy.\n\nIn response, an American warplane\u2014an A-10 \u201dWarthog\u201d\u2014made two strafing runs over the house. Hundreds of rounds of ammunition\u2014bullets the size of large carrots\u2014fired by a weapon designed to disable armoured tanks, poured out of the plane\u2019s Gatling gun. The two Taliban fighters had fled. Instead, Obaidullah and his 15-year-old son Esmatullah were killed; 13 others suffered broken bones and shrapnel injuries from head to toe. One boy, 14-year-old Ehsanullah, lost both his eyes.\n\nIn May this year, The U.S. Department of Defense released its Annual Report on Civilian Casualties. In table format, an entry for Helmand on the same date states: \u201cOperation Type: Air. Killed: 0. Injured: 4.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDEATH BY THE NUMBERS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe war in Afghanistan will soon enter its 19th year. In Qatar, U.S. and Taliban representatives have been hashing out a preliminary agreement that would see a withdrawal timeline for international troops in return for a Taliban guarantee that it would disavow terrorist groups with transnational aspirations seeking to use Afghanistan as a base.\n\nThe Taliban Scoff at Trump\u2019s Afghan Peace Talks Bluff\n\nIn contrast, on the battlefield, both sides are ramping up their military campaigns in an effort to strengthen their negotiating positions. As a result, the number of civilians caught in the crossfire is increasing, too.\n\nIn its latest report on civilian casualties, the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) found that this year, for the first time since it began counting, pro-government forces, including international forces, were responsible for more civilian deaths than the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State\u2019s Afghanistan branch combined. The primary reason for this is an escalation of the U.S. air war in Afghanistan.\n\nIn a conflict that has been unpopular with the American public\u2014and now its president\u2014for years now, the downplaying of the number of Afghan civilians killed in the crossfire is one way the U.S. military\u2014which one senses is more committed to Afghanistan than its political leaders\u2014can mitigate opposition at home.\n\nToday, the rented house Obaidullah\u2019s family was in when it was struck by the warplane last November, is empty. During the day, columns of sunlight pour through a dozen watermelon-sized holes in the roof: evidence of the missile-like bullets that also tore holes through its inhabitants.\n\nAfter they were discharged from hospital, Obaidullah\u2019s two wives and their surviving children moved to the village of Shawal, which is under Taliban control, further north in the same district, with Obaidullah\u2019s brothers.\n\nDay to day security in most rural parts of Afghanistan isn\u2019t so much dictated by who controls the area as by how far it is from the front line. Nor does the side of a front line one chooses to live on necessarily indicate sympathy for one faction or the other.\n\nLoy Manda, where the family lived when their house was struck, was the front line. They hoped moving farther from it, even though that meant going deep into Taliban territory, would be safer. The escalation of the air war, however, means that calculation is no longer a reliable measure of safety.\n\n\u2018TENDENTIOUS PRONOUNCEMENTS\u2019\n\nEhsanullah was 14 when he was brought into the emergency hospital last November. His face was a mess of raw flesh and dried, rusty blood. He had already lost one eye; the other was ruptured and would later be removed by surgeons. The rest of his body was bruised, broken, burned and punctured by debris thrown out as the rounds impacted around him.", "description": "WAKIL KOHSARLOY MANDA, Afghanistan\u2013Bloodied and broken, 13 members of an extended family were lifted, one by one, from a minibus and placed in wheelchairs and on hospital beds with clean white sheets.
