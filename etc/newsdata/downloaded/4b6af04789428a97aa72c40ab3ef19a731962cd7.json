A further unknown percentage of Australians choose not to drill holes because they\u2019re scared of stuffing it up.\n\nBut while Wi-Fi has made it easy for such people to enjoy whole-of-home audio systems they still frequently face problems when it comes to vision. Maybe no more. At last, the no-drill-required idea has reached television stands.\n\nTVs are large lumps and until now have had two types of mount; tabletop and wall.\n\nTabletop mounts are simple and usually supplied free, but their success depends entirely on the table or cabinet upon which they are intended.\n\nHeight is the big issue because at least the lower third of the screen should be at eye level. A table mount atop a higher sideboard or drawers means you\u2019ll spend your entire viewing life looking up rather than straight ahead.\n\nWith wall mounts you can choose height to the millimetre but, yep, you\u2019ll drill holes in the wall and have at least one pesky cable to hide. And you\u2019ll pay extra.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: There are places where neither stand works, especially for renters. A vacant corner in a study may be ideal for a smaller screen but how do you get a television there without drilling holes?\n\nEven if there\u2019s a piece of furniture big enough for a table mount you\u2019re unlikely to be able to get the screen at the angle you want, much less pivot it out of the way when not needed.\n\nIn bedrooms there\u2019s usually a chest of drawers, but you\u2019ll most likely be looking to one side as well as up.\n\nAnd so to the new alternative. One For All is known for its universal remote controls but it\u2019s extending its wings with a neat idea; a couple of stands that let you put your telly anywhere you want without drilling.\n\nIts $399 tripod mount can be placed anywhere. This takes a screen up to 65 inches (165cm) at a range of heights and pivots through 360 degrees.\n\nThere\u2019s a holder for a soundbar and ties for power and data cables. It\u2019s available in oak with silver grey, or walnut with gunmetal.\n\nBut it was the $499 Slimline that caught my eye. This goes hard up against a wall, held in place by whatever cabinet you may have backing onto it; a low component cabinet would be ideal.\n\nThe screen can be positioned through a range of heights with a soundbar on the cabinet underneath. It looks the same as a conventional wall mount, but there are no bolts in the wall.\n\nAnd it has been nicely thought through. It\u2019s indented at the floor support to allow for skirting and the upright, extending from there to the television, also serves as a conduit for any cabling required between the television and the cabinet.\n\nThe aesthetics won\u2019t upset anyone. Well hardly anyone. This one takes televisions up to 60 inches (152cm) and can be tilted through 15 degrees if reflection is a problem.\n\nBoth stands can support up to 30 kilograms and are supplied in flat packs. But fear not; there\u2019s not an allen key in sight. There is an online compatibility tool to tell you if the Slimline will take your telly.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Digital Life, The Sydney Morning Herald's home for everything technology.
