It was not immediately clear who wrote the messages.\n\nA U.S. official said late Monday that U.S. troops had withdrawn from Manbij. Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a U.S. military spokesman, declined to say Tuesday whether Syrian troops or their Russian allies had entered Manbij.\n\nHowever, Syrian state television reported government troops had entered the town early the next day, and a Russian Defense Ministry statement said military police in northwestern Manbij were patrolling \u201calong the line of contact between the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBlokhin is a journalist who works with pro-Kremlin media outlets such as the Abkhazian Network News Agency and appears to often embed with pro-Russian forces in Syria.
