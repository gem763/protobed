Through repetition, our reaction to the jarring siren became an ordinary part of the job.\n\nHaving now completed my tenure in Moscow, it strikes me that the \u201cduck and cover drill\u201d is a fitting metaphor for the defensive posture we as a country have taken in the U.S.-Russia relationship. We have practiced the same approach toward Russia so long that it has now become reflexive\u2014and detrimental to our long-term interests.\n\nFor starters, let\u2019s dispel any lingering illusions about President Vladimir Putin and the layers of sanctions Russia is now under. The U.S., acting alone, won\u2019t succeed in changing his behavior or that of the Russian government. Only the Russian people are capable of this. In fact, demonizing the U.S. and the West with conspiratorial claims of Russophobia-inspired sanctions is good politics for Mr. Putin. His real concerns lie elsewhere. Those concerns are China (yes, China), internal and external threats from radical Islam, and Russia\u2019s own citizens\u2014who are increasingly expressing their frustration through well-organized and large street protests.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Mr. Putin runs the country with unrivaled strength. But his time will pass. We need to do less obsessing about Mr. Putin and more thinking about the institutions and generations that will outlast him. Rather than cutting ourselves off from Russia, which is the inescapable effect of all these sanctions, we need to cultivate constructive relationships with those who will shape Russia\u2019s post-Putin period. The U.S. was caught off guard by Mr. Putin\u2019s unexpected rise to power after the collapse of the Soviet Union. We can\u2019t afford to let that happen again.\n\nWe need more, not less, dialogue with Russia. But first, we need to allow space for discussion about Russia among ourselves. On both sides of the aisle, a reflexive fear of being seen as Putin apologists has calcified our ability to think creatively about our relations with Russia. As security experts know, fear often has a paralyzing effect. If we allow fear to dictate our approach, we may never find or even consider policies that more effectively advance our national interests, improve the bilateral relationship and make the world safer.\n\nIn the U.S., sanctions have become our go-to foreign policy tool to admonish misbehavior. We have placed sanctions on Russia for a host of actions\u2014its bad behavior toward its neighbors, its meddling in our elections, its role in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England, and so on. It\u2019s easy to initiate sanctions, but it has become politically perilous to discuss removing them. By last count, there are almost 850 Russian individuals and entities that have been designated under various sanctions authorities with little or no analysis measuring their efficacy.\n\nMany of those sanctions may be having the desired effect and should be maintained. But not all. It\u2019s time for an honest discussion about whether sanctions are achieving their aims. Are they raising the cost of doing business for certain Kremlin insiders? Absolutely. But are they also effectively influencing the Kremlin\u2019s policies at home and abroad? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nBlithely implementing sanctions without making sure they fit into a larger strategy of engagement costs us the ability to shape outcomes. Russians have accepted that U.S. sanctions will probably remain in place for the long term, inevitably distorting the market as Russians create alternative supply chains that aren\u2019t always conducive to American interests. My embassy colleagues and I heard the same refrain over and over\u2014that in some cases U.S. sanctions are having the opposite of their intended effect, forcing capital back to Russia, buoying Russian domestic sectors and disadvantaging U.S. businesses seeking to gain a strategic market foothold.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop ducking and covering when it comes to the U.S.-Russian relationship. Targeted sanctions smartly applied serve a purpose, but ultimately it is in our national interest to want more than to see some Russian officials squirm. Our goal should be a Russia that is both a better partner and a more responsible global citizen. The U.S.-Russia relationship will continue to be what it has always been\u2014by turns collaborative, competitive and adversarial. Smart diplomacy thus far has managed to keep us from war, but I worry the current estrangement will limit our options for strategic engagement in the years ahead.\n\nTrust doesn\u2019t come easily in this relationship and must be earned over time. But we have to start somewhere.\n\nMr. Huntsman served as ambassador to Singapore (1992-93), governor of Utah (2005-09), ambassador to China (2009-11) and ambassador to Russia (2017-19).", "description": "Sanctions have their place, but some of them are undermining trust without serving their purpose.", "authors": ["Jon Huntsman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113455/social", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
