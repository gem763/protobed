However, police said the woman had no documents to back up her claim.\n\nThe child was then given to a family member while police searched for Todd, the child\u2019s biological mother, according to the Charlotte Observer.\n\nOnce investigators were able to locate her, they determined that Chavis and Romero had traded their vehicle for the child last year.\n\n\u201cThe three have been charged with the unlawful sale, surrender or purchase of a minor and are currently being held on $50,000 bonds at the Davidson County Jail,\u201d according to KSHB Kansas City.\n\nCapt. Brad Saintsing with the Thomasville Police Department said Thursday that the department is still investigating the case and that more charges could be brought.\n\nThe three suspects are due to appear in court on October 21.\n\nIn August of 2012, a similar instance occurred when a man in Orange Park, Florida, went door-to-door at a motel, allegedly trying to trade a baby for food.\n\n\u201cOrange Park police were trying to identify the man, who was picked up by a taxi at a McDonald\u2019s between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Saturday, but there is no record of any taxis picking them up,\u201d according to NBC Miami.\n\nAuthorities said the man and baby were seen with a woman but the relationship between them was unknown.", "description": "A mother North Carolina, was arrested Wednesday along with two other individuals after she allegedly traded her toddler for their used car.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Alice-Leann-Todd-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
