Eleven years ago at the University of Houston, the quarterback started to post record-setting numbers in box scores, displayed a firm command of the spread system and even worked closely with offensive guru Kliff Kingsbury.\n\nThat\u2019s a sexy resume in today\u2019s NFL.\n\nBack then, though, the Baker Mayfields and Kyler Murrays of college football weren\u2019t seen as naturals for the NFL, and Keenum\u2019s video-game numbers didn\u2019t compute. He was a 6-foot-1 passer \u2014 if that \u2014 with critics who dismissed him as a product of the system. He went undrafted.\n\n\u201cWe fought that (label) forever,\u201d said Houston coach Dana Holgorsen, who was Keenum\u2019s offensive coordinator in 2008 and 2009. \u201cThat was frustrating to us for a long time.\u201d\n\nKeenum, though, defied the skeptics. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time he was doubted \u2014 or counted out.\n\nWhen the 31-year-old takes the field Sunday in Philadelphia to face the Eagles as the Redskins\u2019 starting quarterback, Keenum will get another chance to surpass expectations. Keenum was shipped off to the Redskins this past spring after just one season with the Denver Broncos. He hadn\u2019t expected to be traded \u2014 another dip in a career that has featured highs and lows.\n\nThrough it all, those who know the quarterback say they\u2019ve rarely seen him rattled. Not when he received just one college scholarship offer. Not when he went undrafted. Not when he bounced around the NFL, including when the Minnesota Vikings opted to pursue Kirk Cousins in free agency months after Keenum helped lead the team to the NFC Championship game.\n\nAfter finishing a post-practice lifting session, Keenum admitted it hasn\u2019t always been easy. Learning to not be bothered by people\u2019s opinions, he said, is a continuous process.\n\n\u201cEveryday, man,\u201d Keenum told The Washington Times. \u201cThat\u2019s every day of my career. Some days more than others.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Keenum seemed to have finally broken through. Coming off a season which included the \u201cMinneapolis Miracle\u201d \u2014 a last-ditch, game-winning throw to advance in the playoffs \u2014 Keenum signed a two-year, $36 million deal with the Denver Broncos.\n\nIf Minnesota wasn\u2019t going to re-sign him, Keenum loved the idea of playing for John Elway, his childhood idol and Denver\u2019s general manager. He even purchased a house, trying to plant roots with wife Kimberly.\n\nBut after a 6-10 season, Denver decided to move on \u2014 trading for Joe Flacco and then dealing Keenum to the Redskins. The Broncos were even willing to pay half of Keenum\u2019s $7 million salary.\n\n\u201cI would say I was surprised,\u201d Keenum said, \u201cbut nothing\u2019s really surprising to me in this league anymore. You roll with the punches and take it in stride.\u201d\n\nThese days, Keenum is facing a situation similar to earlier in his career. If Keenum struggles, there will be calls for the Redskins\u2019 coaching staff to replace him with first-rounder Dwayne Haskins. Keenum understands, having been benched after nine games when the Los Angeles Rams turned to No.1 pick Jared Goff in 2016. The Rams were 4-5 at the time of the switch.\n\nFormer Redskins receiver Brian Quick, who was cut last weekend and was Keenum\u2019s teammate on the Rams, said Keenum handled the demotion well. The Rams announced the decision in a meeting in front of the team.\n\n\u201cIt just helped build him into who he is right now,\u201d Quick said. \u201cGoing through adversity and showing what you have to fight through anything, that shows a lot of character \u2026 and not worry about certain things they can\u2019t control.\u201d\n\nKeenum didn\u2019t always have that equilibrium. Growing up in Texas, Keenum could be stubborn as a child.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to play games he could control,\u201d said Steve Keenum, Case\u2019s father. \u201cHis sister wanted to play Candyland and she sure loved it, and he didn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d\n\nGradually, Keenum learned.\n\nIn high school, Keenum did everything he could to earn multiple scholarship offers. He attended football camps around Texas, hoping he would stand out. Houston, however, was the only school to offer.\n\nInitially, the Cougars recruited Keenum with the intention of him playing quarterback. But if that didn\u2019t work out, they were prepared to move him to wide receiver, said former Houston coordinator Jason Phillips. Once Keenum arrived, the school never looked back.\n\nWhile at Houston, Keenum became the NCAA\u2019s all-time leader in passing yards, touchdowns and completions. By those who were on that Houston coaching staff, Keenum has never been overlooked. Holgorsen hopes an NFL team can come to the same realization.\n\n\u201cI understand why teams take him because they\u2019re thinking this guy is nonetheless going to be a backup for (years), but then he gets into the different systems and he ends up winning the job every single year,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why teams keep trying to replace him because they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
