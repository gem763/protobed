If the government will take advice, the unemployment problem can be solved.\n\nThe Langeberg Unemployed Forum has discovered that there is a solution to the unemployment problem in South Africa.\n\nAll we need is for the government and Parliament to listen to us.\n\nUnemployment is caused by the labour laws that benefit the employed and disrespect the constitutional rights of the unemployed.\n\nGiving back to the unemployed their rights to make their own decisions about their working lives will solve the problem.\n\nThe solution is to put decisions about our jobs in our hands. Create an exemption certificate in the law that we can apply for, that exempts us from the labour laws.\n\nIt must give us the freedom to contract with any employer of our choice.\n\nThose who don\u2019t want to be exempted need not apply. The certificate must allow us to enter into any agreement with any employer, at any wage and on any conditions that we are prepared to accept.\n\nSmall businesses, individuals and the unemployed will then demonstrate how freedom in the workplace can transform a country.\n\nThe Langeberg Unemployed Forum is taking on a job-destroying Goliath for the sake of all the unemployed people of South Africa.\n\nGoliath consists of legislation and regulations adopted by Parliament that are suffocating the unemployed and preventing us from getting jobs.\n\nWe are calling on all jobless people to stand together to demand that Parliament must remove the barriers that cause us to be without jobs.\n\nThe barriers that prevent us from getting jobs are laws and regulations that protect and support the employed but at the same time cause us to have no jobs and cause the \u201cno jobs\u201d signs to go up outside factories and other businesses.\n\nThese businesses don\u2019t want to talk to anyone who has been unemployed for a long time, is inexperienced, is old, or suffers from any form of handicap.\n\nEmployers can\u2019t take people on trial to see if they can do the job or even to see if they will get along with the rest of the staff. Job seekers can\u2019t offer to work for a low wage to get a foot on the jobs ladder.\n\nThe laws look as if they are only meant to make employers behave better: pay higher wages, give workers benefits, and increase their job security by stopping them from getting fired.\n\nTo achieve this, the laws impose harsh penalties on employers who do something that is not strictly according to the labour laws.\n\nBecause of the strict laws the employers have become very careful about hiring staff.\n\nLarge firms have labour law specialists managing staff issues.\n\nThese specialists play it safe. They do background checks on job applicants and will only hire people with clear records and references from previous employers.\n\nEmployers are not nasty people; they are being careful. They are careful because if they accidentally or deliberately fail to obey the labour laws they can find themselves being charged in the CCMA for breaking the law.\n\nIf we don\u2019t understand the position of businesses, especially small businesses, we will never be able to solve this problem.\n\nIn our submission on the national minimum wage, we and others pleaded with the members of the labour portfolio committee not to agree to it.\n\nOur argument was simple. If we can\u2019t even get a job when the wage is R2000, who will employ us at R3500?\n\nWe also told them that wages in the cities are higher than wages in the rural areas, so applying the minimum wage nationally guarantees more unemployment in the rural areas.\n\nThis is not the way to treat poor employers and their staff, when the employers are paying what they can afford, and it is the best job option the staff can find.\n\nWhat we have learnt is that the government and the members of Parliament either do not understand what is happening in the job market or they do not care about the small businesses and the unemployed.\n\nHow else can anyone explain one law after another being passed that makes matters worse for everybody at the bottom end of the job market.\n\n\u2022 Xolile Mpini, Vuyo Mruba and Denki Selani are members of the Langeberg Unemployed Forum", "description": "As we predicted in our comment on the national minimum wage, the unemployed number has burst through the 10 million barrier to settle at 10.226 million (38.5% of the labour force).", "authors": ["Xolile Mpini", "Vuyo Mruba", "Denki Selani"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9051/4ba675ac4e764f60962f998adc251c73.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-02"}
