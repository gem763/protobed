But after launching her political campaign in 2017, she decided the time was right to open up about his drug arrest and incarceration, when she was just 8 years old. That decision, while personally painful, helped spark a transformation that has led her to become one of the nation\u2019s leading criminal justice reformers.\n\n\u201cI never talked about it,\u201d Bottoms, now 49, told Yahoo News at her City Hall office, in her most in-depth interview about the personal impact of her father\u2019s arrest. \u201cThere was a lot of shame. Maybe once or twice I talked about it publicly and once or twice privately.\u201d\n\nWith mass incarceration disproportionately affecting the African-American community, once Bottoms did go public about her father\u2019s arrest, she quickly realized that she wasn\u2019t alone.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, especially when we\u2019re elected officials, we feel the need to dial back who we really are and what our experiences are,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my story; it\u2019s our story \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of people\u2019s story.\u201d\n\nThe son of Mississippi sharecroppers, born in 1939, Major Lance fled the Jim Crow South with his parents for Chicago in 1950, during what has come to be known as the Great Migration. As a result of federal redlining policies that kept African-Americans out of white neighborhoods, his family had few housing options and moved into the infamous Cabrini-Green projects. By the time he attended Wells High School, Lance had become known for his skill at basketball and boxing and had begun to dream of a singing career like his hero, Jackie Wilson. At Wells, he met up-and-coming singer-musician Jerry Butler and songwriter Curtis Mayfield and formed a partnership with Mayfield that would help land him a deal with Okeh Records.\n\nFor a time, it looked as though Lance was destined for major fame. Two of his Mayfield-written songs, \u201cMonkey Time\u201d and \u201cUm, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um,\u201d rose to the top 10 on both R&B and pop charts. During a 1964 appearance on \u201cAmerican Bandstand,\u201d Dick Clark told the shy singer, \u201cYou\u2019ve got it, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d A year later, Paul McCartney of the Beatles was photographed stepping off a plane following a U.S. tour proudly displaying the cover of one of Lance\u2019s albums.\n\nWith the civil rights movement gaining steam, Lance relocated from Chicago to Atlanta 1965, where he met Bottoms\u2019s mother at the Royal Peacock R&B nightclub, just blocks from the Auburn Avenue home where Martin Luther King Jr. was born and raised. The couple wed and had three children, of whom Bottoms was the youngest. Lance continued to release records, but none duplicated his early success. Still, in 1972, he landed a two-year headlining slot on England\u2019s Northern Soul circuit, where he drew rave reviews playing alongside musicians like Reggie Dwight, later known as Elton John.\n\nAfter returning with his wife and kids to Atlanta, Lance continued to perform across the South, even as his record sales waned. He embraced his role as a stay-at-home dad, Bottoms said, preparing dinner each night for his kids while his wife returned to work. Unbeknownst to his family, however, he had also begun making money on the side, dealing drugs, which led to what Bottoms calls the \u201cworst day\u201d of her life.\n\n\u201cAs I was walking to the door, they were bringing my dad out with his hands behind his back, and I just remember him telling me it was going to be OK,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cThere were just men all over our house, and they had torn everything apart. My toys were in a cardboard box, and they had torn that up.\u201d\n\nThe police ordered Bottoms and her siblings to sit on the living room couch as they continued to ransack the apartment, the mayor said, warning them not to tell anyone about the raid.\n\n\u201cWe sat there for hours and cried and eventually my sister and brother got up, but I was afraid to move because they\u2019d told us we\u2019d be in trouble if we did,\u201d Bottoms said, her eyes glassing over with tears. \u201cThat day was the death of our family. My parents divorced while my dad was in prison. We were never a family unit again.\u201d\n\nSentenced to 10 years, Lance ended up serving four years behind bars, moved from one Georgia prison to another.\n\n\u201cI chuckle about this now, but wherever he was is where I would say he was living,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cOh, yeah, my dad\u2019s living in Columbus now, or Jackson, or Eatonton. You talk about the shame of my 8-year-old mind.\u201d\n\nFollowing his release from prison, health problems curtailed Lance\u2019s ability to perform and, in 1994, he died of heart failure at the age of 55. By then, Bottoms had learned to omit his arrest from the retelling of his life. But while it continued to weigh upon her, she made sure it never slowed her own ambition. After graduating from Frederick Douglass High School, she received a BA from Florida A&M University, then, the same year her father died, she earned a JD from Georgia State University College of Law before going on to positions as a prosecutor and a judge.\n\nIn 2009, by which time her father\u2019s arrest had faded from local memory, Bottoms entered politics, winning a seat on Atlanta\u2019s city council, where a chance meeting would eventually bring his troubled history back into focus.\n\n\u2018Those dark days\u2019\n\nIn a brick office building bordered by Atlanta\u2019s rundown Greyhound bus station and the Magic City strip club, Xochitil Bervera, director of the Racial Justice Action Center, spoke to Yahoo News about the transformative personal bond forged between Mayor Bottoms and activist Marilynn Winn.\n\nXochitil Bervera, director of the Racial Justice Action Center, at the nonprofit's office in downtown Atlanta. (Photo: Lynsey Weatherspoon for Yahoo News) More\n\n\u201cIn terms of getting her to tell her story, I really see Marylin, and the way she tells her story without shame, as what\u2019s made that possible for the mayor to move to a place where she can talk about it and make policy about it,\u201d Bervera said as a MARTA train passed by the window along a section of elevated track.\n\nWinn and Bervera first approached Bottoms in 2014 to lobby the reluctant councilwoman to support a \u201cban the box\u201d legislation that would forbid city agencies from inquiring about an applicant\u2019s arrest history.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t always in lockstep,\u201d Bervera said of Bottoms, but she and Winn sensed an ally in the young politician. \u201cShe came and asked about criminal justice reform. She said to us, \u2018I want to know more. Teach me more.\u2019\u201d\n\nNo one taught Bottoms more than Winn, the founder of Women on the Rise, a nonprofit that has successfully pushed a platform of criminal justice reform informed by Winn\u2019s own time in prison. Raised in Atlanta\u2019s Buttermilk Bottom \u201cghetto,\u201d as Winn called it, she learned from her grandmother how to shoplift for food when she was just 5.\n\n\u201cEvery Friday we\u2019d meet my grandfather at the store and I\u2019d say, \u2018Can I have this, can I have that?\u2019 and my grandmother would say stuff like, \u2018Eat it before you get to the counter or hide it,\u201d Winn, 69, told Yahoo News at her East Point office \u2014 a converted two-story home with a creaky front porch. \u201cIt got to be where I stopped asking because I knew what she was going to say. It became a way of life for me.\u201d\n\nAfter run-ins with the juvenile justice system and her first adult conviction for theft, Winn also soon learned that having a criminal record greatly diminished her chances of finding a job.\n\n\u201cI got out of prison and I thought that I could have a life and work at the post office like my friends, but it didn\u2019t happen for me because I had a prison record,\u201d Winn said. \u201cI got 18 different jobs, but I was terminated when they found out about my record, and that threw me back into a life of crime and I started to go back to shoplifting, which landed me back in prison.\u201d\n\nHer prospects dim, she turned to drugs and became addicted to crack. Seemingly locked in a cycle of poverty, substance abuse and incarceration, Winn turned around when a judge recognized that her problems didn\u2019t stem from an unwillingness to work. Rather than put her back in prison, he sent her to a drug treatment center, where she overcame her addiction. The program helped her find a part-time job that didn\u2019t require hiding the truth about her lengthy arrest record.\n\nWomen on the Rise founder Marilynn Winn.

Minor offenses like traffic infractions, panhandling and loitering frequently resulted in prison time for African-Americans while white offenders more often walked free. In the 1960s, King himself ended up in jail for violating such ordinances as he pushed for desegregation. For many African-Americans, convictions not only kept them from finding work, they also exacted an emotional toll, by branding them as criminals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got this thing about shame and guilt,\u201d Winn said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to express ourselves. Years ago, I wouldn\u2019t sit here and talk about my story because I\u2019d be afraid of what you\u2019d think of me.\u201d\n\nHaving secured the votes to pass the \u201cban the box\u201d measure that made Atlanta the first Southern city to do away with a requirement for job applicants to disclose prior criminal convictions, Winn and Bervera next set their sights on an even more ambitious goal, closing the Atlanta City Detention Center. Winn herself had been incarcerated in the hulking 17-story, 471,000-square-foot jail on Peachtree Street, and she had come to view the building as a symbol of a system that puts a priority on locking people up. For Bervera, ACDC, as it is known, is simply a remnant of the city\u2019s racist past.\n\n\u201cIn 1996 the jail was built specifically for the Olympics, to hide the homeless people from the people coming to visit. It has been how this city has policed and jailed for decades,\u201d Bervera said.\n\nDepartment of Corrections Chief Patrick Labat denies that ACDC was intended to help keep poor people out of public view.\n\n\u201cI would contend that those people arrested were done on officers\u2019 discretion and would still be arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is where would they go.\u201d\n\nWhen Bottoms became mayor, she made the case that jail shouldn\u2019t be the default destination for people charged with petty offenses. One of her first acts was to eliminate the cash bail requirement for those accused of violating any of dozens of city ordinances, which meant freeing hundreds of arrestees each day who otherwise would have been sent to ACDC. Further depleting its population, she ended Atlanta\u2019s partnership with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a response to the administration\u2019s family separation policy.\n\n\u201cWhen I began asking questions about which detainees we would be receiving, I just couldn\u2019t receive assurances that we weren\u2019t going to be complicit, and that\u2019s when I signed the executive order to end the relationship,\u201d Bottoms said.\n\nLabat gives the mayor credit for \u201cthinking outside the box\u201d and helping lower ACDC\u2019s inmate population from roughly 800 prisoners per night to a low of 67 in August, leaving its cell blocks, exercise yards and hallways largely empty.\n\nCell block at the Atlanta City Detention Center.

Yet ACDC \u2014 which Bottoms has proposed converting into a drug-treatment and job-training center \u2014 is still ringed by bail bond businesses, including \u201cFree at Last,\u201d whose flippant name merges one of King\u2019s most memorable quotes with the grim reality that many African-Americans in his hometown are still only dreaming about equality. Before long, Bervera said hopefully, the bondsmen too would be forced to close up shop.\n\n\u201cWhat Mayor Bottoms did with that was to bring the jail population down to a number that even the conservatives on public safety and criminal justice could say, \u2018How could we be paying $32 million a year to house 100 people a night?\u2019\u201d Bervera said.\n\nOf course, not everyone in Atlanta is happy about Bottoms\u2019s vision of transforming ACDC from a jail into a place that helps people from ever ending up in one. At a February town hall meeting with residents of the mostly white and affluent Buckhead neighborhood, when she brought up her plan for the building, she faced an angry backlash.\n\n\u201cI was booed when I talked about repurposing our city jail and creating this equity center,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cThe beauty of it was, for all of the boos that I received, I got messages from people saying, \u2018I was embarrassed that my neighbors booed you, and I support and respect what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 Sometimes the loudest voices in the room aren\u2019t reflective of what the majority of people want.\u201d\n\nShe has a point. Even President Trump, who boasts about his hard-line approach to justice, signed the First Step Act, reducing mandatory minimum prison sentences and leading to the release of thousands of nonviolent inmates. Major Lance could have been among them.\n\n\u2018Conveniently tucked away\u2019\n\nBack when she first met Bottoms, Winn couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she\u2019d met her before. \u201cI kept looking at her eyes and her smile,\u201d Winn said. \u201cI knew I recognized her.\u201d\n\nEven before Bottoms began speaking publicly about father, Winn had already recognized her resemblance to Lance, whom she had met in the late \u201970s, during \u201cthose dark days\u201d of drug addiction.\n\n\u201cHe was selling drugs, and we both were using,\u201d Winn said. \u201cI was in his circle.\u201d\n\nOne day, when the two women spoke following an event, she decided to bring it up.\n\n\u201cWhen I talked to her about knowing her father and remembering instances that happened, she turned instantly into a little girl,\u201d Winn said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to talk about it, and she didn\u2019t think nobody knew.\u201d\n\nThat reaction made Winn reticent to reveal one more secret \u2014 that Lance had once sold her cocaine. \u201cShe still don\u2019t know,\u201d Winn confided. \u201cOr maybe she does. We never had that conversation.\u201d\n\nWhile Bottoms said she still has parts of her past that she has \u201cconveniently tucked away,\u201d she doesn\u2019t regret opening up about what happened to her father.\n\n\u201cWhen I began running for mayor, what struck me was that I was misunderstood and I felt as if I had to be a lot more exposed for people to understand that when I talked about the sense of community that I wanted to help restore in this city and this notion of justice and creating this beloved community was more than something I just said,\u201d Bottoms recalled. \u201cPeople needed to know what it meant to me. The only way that they would know that is if I was more open about my story and my family\u2019s story. Even those who knew that my father had gone to prison, I don\u2019t think they realized the impact that it had on my family.\u201d\n\nFramed album cover in the office of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. (Photo: Lynsey Weatherspoon for Yahoo News) More\n\nA framed picture of the cover of \u201cMajor Lance\u2019s Greatest Hits\u201d hangs in the mayor\u2019s office, and while she is clearly still pained by the memories of her father\u2019s arrest, she now understands his crime as part of a larger problem whose roots stretch back to an era intent on keeping African-Americans from equality.\n\n\u201cMy dad never tried to act as if he was not wrong or blame anyone else,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cI do believe had there been alternative sentencing and had there been other options and had there been a drug court and had there been something else on the other side other than sentencing a man who\u2019d never had so much as a traffic ticket to 10 years in prison, then I think the lives of his children and everyone else around him would have been different.\u201d\n\nLike her father, Bottoms is a self-described introvert who has chosen a career that puts her on a very public stage. Her reckoning with her dad\u2019s past, however, has given her the confidence to voice ideas that have made her a national leader on criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this generational curse, in some ways, with the African-American community and I think that part of that deals with addiction and how we work through our challenges. As I said, I\u2019d never talked about my dad\u2019s incarceration, because it\u2019s not what we did in our household. For so many of us in the African-American community, we\u2019re not very far removed from these very real challenges,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cFor a lot of us who may be professionals, we are the exceptions in our families. For every person who is successful, on the other side there may be 10 family members who haven\u2019t gotten to that place yet. I would imagine that white America might not realize how common that is in the African-American community.\u201d\n\nPerhaps just as important as finding her public voice, Bottoms has learned to speak about her dad with pride again.\n\n\u201cI think he thought he was doing the right thing because he was trying to provide for us. People do what they need to do in order to survive,\u201d Bottoms said, adding, \u201cHe was a great dad to me, but he was human, and that\u2019s what addiction does. It makes you do things that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise do.\u201d\n\nA staff member reminds her of her schedule and Bottoms glances at her Apple Watch. Asked if she knows the extent of Winn\u2019s relationship with her father, she smiles.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll read about it in your piece,\u201d she says after a pause. \u201cI know that there\u2019s a story there.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms opens up about the arrest of her father, R&B legend Major Lance.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LTr_UkU8t1BoCPSjf85e3g--~B/aD0zMDA3O3c9NDUxMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/f83b2190-d1a3-11e9-bfee-518c19267b7b", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
