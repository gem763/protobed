The film centers on three eager applicants seeking to expand the pictographic corpus. To achieve their ambitions, they must submit their pitches to the Unicode Consortium, which maintains global standards for digital text display, and approves and accepts all new emoji.\n\nWe have, in a sense, begun to cede to corporations the building blocks of speech\u2014and\n\nthought\u2014itself.\n\nA Muslim teenager wants a hijab, a group of Argentines pine for a mat\u00e9 gourd, and an international nonprofit aims to destigmatize menstruation by adding an emoji that evokes a period. (After much internal debate, the group settles on a pair of blood-stained underwear.) The push for more equitable and inclusive representation goes beyond political correctness; two university researchers found that watching television decreased self-esteem in every demographic they surveyed except white boys\u2014the only group who mostly saw themselves. \u201cFive months ago, I created a group chat for my friends on WhatsApp,\u201d says Rayouf Alhumedi, the hijabi teen. \u201cBoth my friends \u2026 had an emoji to represent them. But I didn\u2019t have one.\u201d The writer Rhianna Jones recently proposed an Afro emoji to reflect the \u201cdiversity of Black, Afro-Latinx and other Diasporic communities with kinkier, spherical, coily hair.\u201d This year, the Unicode Consortium approved emoji of hearing aids, mechanical limbs, and gender-neutral couples.\n\nUnicode publishes a guideline for submitting new emoji proposals. It is more than 6,000 words long. Among the 16 factors and subfactors considered: Does the candidate emoji have notable metaphorical references or symbolism? Is there a clearly recognizable image of a physical object that could serve as a paradigm? Curiously, near the top, following a red X, it scolds: Don\u2019t justify the addition of emoji because they further a \u201ccause,\u201d no matter how worthwhile. On some level, such conservatism makes sense. Unicode can\u2019t delete emoji\u2014doing so would defeat the purpose of maintaining a universal standard\u2014and a trigger-happy approvals process risks cluttering up the library with paeans to passing fads. For this reason, the consortium also prohibits submissions based on the likenesses of celebrities, brands, or logos. Nevertheless, some brands manage to work a shadow game. The pickup truck emoji\u2014which made it past the \u201cprovisional\u201d round and is currently on the cusp of Unicode immortality\u2014was masterminded by Ford. The proposal form lists its author as Nathan Maggio, formerly creative director at the consulting firm Blue State Digital, which counts Ford as a client. (Maggio has since left the agency and now works for Elizabeth Warren.) In retrospect, a phrase from the proposal\u2019s introductory text\u2014\u201cit is time for our global visual language to get a little bit tougher\u201d\u2014should have been a giveaway.\n\nThat these requests are adjudicated by an organization composed of ten technology companies\u2014Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google, Huawei, IBM, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, SAP\u2014and, curiously, the government of Oman (where journalists and activists are routinely imprisoned for criticizing the state on social media \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d) should perhaps raise an eyebrow. Do we consider these companies responsible stewards of our digital conversations? The YouTube recommendation algorithm created a breeding ground for child pornography enthusiasts. Facebook allowed military personnel in Myanmar to use the site to mount a years-long disinformation campaign that culminated in the Rohingya genocide. This track record doesn\u2019t quite evoke thoughtful upkeep. When the blood-stained underwear languishes in subcommittee\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what that means,\u201d one forlorn activist admits\u2014the group tries again with a sanitized version, perhaps more palatable to the powers that be: a simple drop of blood. A colleague chimes in, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get change done when you\u2019ve got the Unicode Consortium, this shady organization based in Silicon Valley, controlling everything.\u201d\n\nMost of our digital conversations are mediated and monitored by corporations and governments; this is hardly a revelation. But Apple doesn\u2019t own the letter A. It does own smiley face with hearts and all the rest. We have, in a sense, begun to cede to corporations the building blocks of speech\u2014and thought\u2014itself. A friend of mine recently described a mildly horrifying feedback loop: \u201cNow, when I experience a tender moment, instead of sending an emoji, I imagine myself as the crying cat.\u201d\n\nLest we forget, emoji are not universal. The Unicode Consortium builds a common set of \u201ccode points\u201d\u2014like a skeleton\u2014for each emoji, but the various companies that want to provide emoji keyboards to their users get to dress up the skeletons however they please. \u201cIn the past couple of years, many of the larger vendors have converged,\u201d Kelly told me. \u201cBut there are still some discrepancies.\u201d An ear of corn tilted left instead of right, a rowboat moving through choppy instead of placid waters, a chocolate chip cookie that transforms, en route from an iPhone to a Samsung device, from one of grandma\u2019s specialties into what appears to be a Saltine cracker\u2014perhaps these little unlikenesses won\u2019t leave anyone scratching their head for too long.\n\nSome incongruities are significant. For a couple of years, a squirt gun sent from that same iPhone became a revolver when viewed anywhere else. Goldman, the emoji law expert, insists that when emoji appear as evidence in court, they should always come in pairs, so the judge and the jury can see what the image looked like to the sender and to the recipient. \u201cOne of the platforms interprets astonished face with Xs for eyes,\u201d he told me. \u201cSomeone might send astonished face, meaning to convey astonishment, which is reinterpreted by the recipient as a death threat.\u201d\n\nIn The Emoji Code, Evans cites research conducted at the University of Minnesota that makes plain the divergences, however subtle. Participants were shown 22 emoji across different platforms and asked to rank how positive or negative they understood their meaning to be, on a scale of -5 to 5. Most depictions of grinning face with smiling eyes hovered around 4, near the most positive pole. Apple\u2019s strangely pained-seeming version got a -1. In the presentation Goldman gives to judges, he refers to a survey of Twitter users in which one-fourth of respondents were unaware that emoji are rendered differently across platforms. Twenty percent said they would not have sent their tweets had they known.\n\nEmoji first started showing up on cell phones and pagers in Japan. The first widely used library, designed by Shigetaka Kurita, was released in 1999, and contained 176 images, each composed of no more than 144 pixels. (Kurita developed some of the early prototypes by coloring in squares of twelve-by-twelve grids on sheets of graph paper.) In 2016, the Museum of Modern Art acquired Kurita\u2019s set, touting it as the \u201coriginal.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut origin stories are often slippery; Jeremy Burge, the founder and editor-in-chief of Emojipedia, claims to have identified, along with other emoji experts, a smaller library, designed by SoftBank, which predates Kurita\u2019s by two years. (Burge recently traveled to Japan to get some \u201chand time\u201d with old devices that are hard to find online. \u201cI just wandered around old phone stores, checking phone models to pin down the status of these discontinued emoji sets,\u201d he said.) In The Story of Emoji, a Prestel art book packed with colorful illustrations, the writer Gavin Lucas points to the nascent technological conditions of mid-\u201990s Japan as the perfect emoji crucible. Widespread digital communication had begun to emerge\u2014via new devices, like pagers, and technologies, like email\u2014and old customs had a hard time keeping up. \u201cIn Japanese culture,\u201d he writes, \u201cpersonal letters are traditionally long and verbose, full of seasonal greetings and honorific expressions that convey the sender\u2019s goodwill to the recipient. The shorter, more casual nature of email was at odds with this tradition.\u201d Emoji did the work for all the words that got left out.\n\nPresently, there exist 3,019 emoji, a 17-fold increase over Kurita\u2019s set. In the film Picture Character, we see him stare lovingly at his designs, displayed on a digital board in the MoMA lobby. \u201cTo be honest, the current emoji have become so complicated, in some ways they\u2019ve strayed from my original creation,\u201d he says.\n\nThe control exerted by the consortium has largely insulated emoji from the anarchic thrum of creativity that characterizes the trade of memes and GIFs.\n\nOne senses a shift in this history from vague yet capacious ideographic concepts to literal, pictographic representation. The impulse toward comprehensive mapping recalls Borges\u2019s famous short story, \u201cOn Exactitude in Science,\u201d in which the Cartographers Guild of an unnamed nation endeavors to make ever more exhaustive maps of its territory, increasing in size and scope until eventually it produces a map \u201cwhose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it.\u201d But the utility of a map depends as much on what it omits as what it includes, and subsequent generations \u201csaw that the vast map was Useless,\u201d and let it decay into tatters.\n\nThe rudimentary appearance and limited purview of early emoji sets forced users to fill in the gaps. Today, many of the most popular emoji\u2014upside down smiley, smiling face with horns, pile of poo, wide eyes\u2014operate in similarly ambiguous territory. The requisite interpretative gloss, the need to uncover a precise meaning, becomes part of the appeal. \u201cThe problem is, at this point, something like 90 percent of emoji are literal, and don\u2019t get used that often,\u201d Kelly told me. \u201cThe other 10 percent that aren\u2019t so literal, those are like the well-worn pair of jeans that get a ton of everyday use.\u201d Eventually, that favorite pair of jeans gets buried under a mountain of other clothes. \u201cIf you have an emoji for everything, you kind of have an emoji for nothing. When we start having total, one-to-one representation, the value goes down, because the creativity goes down. We\u2019re chipping away at the flexibility.\u201d\n\nOn Change.org, the online petition platform, there are campaigns for beard emoji (\u201cBeards are amazing and I would like to express my love for the bearded community\u201d), worm emoji (\u201cWorms deserve love and recognition!\u201d), white wine emoji (\u201cTime to take a stand!\u201d), and an emoji of Lemmy Kilmister, the deceased lead singer of the band Mot\u00f6rhead, \u201cthe badest [sic] motherfucker the world has ever known.\u201d\n\nPicture Character contains a montage of similarly outlandish requests. One avid user angles for an anglerfish: \u201cWe still have only twelve ocean emojis, two of which are whales, most of which are shallow water animals. And anglerfish in general are iconic deep sea species.\u201d Another desires vegetables: \u201cI thought the set of emoji could be improved by adding members of the allium family. Garlic, onions, ramps, leeks, scallions, shallots.\u201d Senator Angus King of Maine, gesticulating on a dock, shills for a local delicacy: \u201cWe sent a letter to the Unicode Consortium saying, you know, this is outrageous. We\u2019ve got crab emoji, we\u2019ve got all these other kinds of emoji. No lobster!\u201d These pleas are less about representation than imposition: an emoji library that reflects what people like, rather than what they are like.\n\nEven the Unicode folks seem to want a way out. \u201cWe only hope that there would be a better answer,\u201d says Craig Cummings, vice chair of the Unicode Technical Committee, with the sporting yet exasperated expression of someone who agreed to cook for a party that has quadrupled in size. On its web site, buried at the bottom of a long technical document, Unicode identifies its vision for the future as one in which people can use and upload their own \u201carbitrary emoji symbols,\u201d rather than relying on libraries produced by tech companies. The idea sounds simple, but such a shift would require \u201csignificant infrastructure changes.\u201d Until then, we\u2019ll have to play with toys we\u2019re given.\n\nAnd so we do. Hearts when we love someone, kissy faces when we miss them, a slice of pizza when we want a slice of pizza. Banality begins to ossify. The tight control exerted by the consortium has largely insulated emoji from the anarchic thrum of creativity that characterizes the trade of memes and GIFs, which flame in and out of being at dizzying speeds. Some inventive repurposing manages to take hold\u2014an eggplant here, a peach there\u2014but emoji are made not by us, but for us, and their usage tends to reflect these circumstances.\n\nAberrations, though few and far between, glimmer with possibility. This summer, two enormous, spray-painted emoji\u2014one sticking out its tongue, the other\u2019s mouth replaced with a zipper\u2014appeared on the side of a house in Manhattan Beach, California. The owner, Kathryn Kidd, circumvented Unicode\u2019s hostility to customization and slapped bushy eyelashes on each. According to Easy Reader News, a local beachfront paper, neighbors had reported the property for violating a city ordinance banning short-term rentals, like Airbnb, and Kidd was fined $4,000. One of those neighbors, Susan Wieland, had recently gotten eyelash extensions. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been directly attacked,\u201d she told Easy Reader. Kidd denies targeting her, though the emoji stare directly into Wieland\u2019s house, and the artist Kidd commissioned posted an image of his handiwork on Instagram with the hashtag \u201ceyelashextensions.\u201d Snitches get stitches, I suppose. Hope the cops don\u2019t nab her for making a terroristic threat.", "description": "We\u2019re ceding to corporations the building blocks of speech\u2014and thought\u2014itself.", "authors": ["Micah Hauser"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/168b037c1ee1d6979f6621c91df7f8cf29d20aad.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
