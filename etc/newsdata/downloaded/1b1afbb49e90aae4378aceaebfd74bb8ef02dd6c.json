Asked about the Trump campaign and RNC's unmatched third quarter fundraising haul, Warren said to hold large-dollar fundraisers would be counter to the message of her campaign.\n\n\"No, I will not be forced to make changes in how I raise money. Look, to me this is pretty straightforward,\" she told CBS News in an interview Tuesday. \"Either you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires, corporate executives and lobbyists, and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it's about a grassroots. Let's build this from the ground up.\"\n\nWhen asked whether she'd guarantee she would continue not to attend big-money fundraisers during the general election, Warren had told CBS News, \"Sure. Now, I want to be clear, I'm going to help the party, because I'm a team player here and I don't want to see Democrats unilaterally disarmed. But I know exactly how I'm going to run my campaign.\" But at the time, she didn't explicitly say she would attend the larger fundraiser events.\n\nWhile Warren will continue to limit the funding of her own campaign to small-dollar donations, her approach to the party's high-roller fundraisers is a tacit acknowledgment that \"voluntary efforts are not enough to create the big, structural change we need for our rigged political system,\" Orthman said. Warren also plans to roll out a campaign finance plan some time in the next few weeks to address this.\n\nWarren raised $24.6 million in the third quarter entirely from small-dollar donors, putting her near the top of of the field in fundraising, surpassed only by Bernie Sanders, who raised $25.3 million.\n\nNBC News first reported that she was clarifying her position and that she would in fact attend high-dollar events for the party.\n\nSwearing off the large-dollar fundraisers was sure to create conflicts with the national party committees, since her approach would be less effective in helping to raise money for the Democrats running down the ticket in Senate and House races, as well as in state legislatures. It would make that kind of fundraising significantly more difficult for party activists and leaders who would be working for her campaign in swing states.\n\nEd O'Keefe contributed to this report.", "description": "Warren had previously told CBS News that high-dollar fundraisers run counter to the message of her campaign", "authors": ["Zak Hudak"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/10/2b8a6b50-eb80-4eea-bee0-5f04ef355c5c/thumbnail/1200x630/b3038b49b4f2a9f0dc15f99a3470daa1/gettyimages-1179049887.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
