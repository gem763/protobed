Build the vineyards, and they will come\u2014and in this case, \u201cthey\u201d refers to five-star hotels ranging from luxurious classics to unique boutique properties, along with talented and creative chefs delivering the best of the region\u2019s cuisine. When Down Under for your next adventure, visiting its wine country offers the inside track to all of the best that Australia has to offer.\n\nEven better, it\u2019s incredibly convenient to link up several different wine regions and anchor cities into one cohesive and convenient trip. Start in Melbourne for a taste of one of the world's great food and art capitals, and then rent or hire a car for the quick one-hour jaunt along the coast to the Mornington Peninsula.\n\nDrink your fill, and then switch from Victoria to South Australia with a quick 90-minute flight to Adelaide. Sometimes overlooked among Australia\u2019s more famous destinations, Adelaide\u2019s charming, condensed city center offers a wealth of delightful dining and drinking opportunities. From there, McLaren Vale is calling, hardly 25 miles to the south. Explore two great Australian cities, two wine region gems, in one incredible outing.\n\nSTAY\n\nIn Melbourne, Ovolo Laneways offers an ideal starting point to experience the city\u2019s famed laneways, small back alleys now lined with trendy shops, cafes, and art galleries. Explore the area on foot to acclimate yourself to the city, perhaps continuing to AC/DC Lane, named in tribute to the Australian band, filled with rock & roll murals and art installations. Don\u2019t mistake the Ovolo\u2019s laid back vibes and contemporary, casual styling for a lack of luxury. Consider booking yourself the top-floor suite, replete with a private rooftop hot tub, full bar and kitchen, arcade games, and space enough for all your friends.\n\nLeaving Melbourne for Mornington, consider a stay at one of two wineries with lavish accommodations right in their vineyards. At the sleek Port Phillip Estate, there are six luxury suites, each seemingly cut straight from the pages of an architectural magazine, offering a unique experience that matches the intimacy of a quaint B&B with the modern appointments you\u2019d expect at a full-service five-star.\n\nAt Jackalope, a two-year old hotel at the Willow Creek Vineyard, your gears will click quickly into indulgence and relaxation as the property\u2019s playlist welcomes you into your designer room, outfitted with minimalist black and white room d\u00e9cor, including an open floor plan with a sunken extra-large bathtub in its center. All the better to take in the views of the made-for-Instagram vineyard-side infinity pool awaiting you below and the sweeping vineyards beyond\u2014not uncommonly seen dotted with kangaroos hopping through\u2014stretching to the horizons. The property\u2019s Doot Doot Doot restaurant offers a tasting menu experience not to miss, while the more casual Rare Hare serves as the cellar door for the vineyard.\n\nWINE & DINE\n\nMelbourne\u2019s Attica thrives as the linchpin of the country\u2019s movement towards highlighting indigenous ingredients in fascinating new ways. Chef Ben Shewry has earned wide acclaim for such efforts, and continues delivering a rollicking meal with more than a few twists, turns, surprises\u2014and perhaps in-restaurant venue changes during the meal\u2014along the way, an endeavor which may last a full evening. That should fuel you until your arrival in Mornington, where a wondrous world of wine awaits.\n\nThe region is relatively young, kicking off in earnest in 1972 after fires wiped off a small number of earlier vines. Pinot Noir and Chardonnay dominate here, neither of which had been prominent in Australia beforehand, though the peninsula setting provides a fitting home for such grapes with its maritime, moderate climate. Consider stops such as Moorooduc Estate and Ten Minutes By Tractor, along with Polperro, where you\u2019ll find a selection of single vineyard offerings showcasing fringe varieties in the region such as Cortese and Sauvignon Blanc. Of course, a tasting is only natural at the on-site vineyards if you\u2019re staying at either Port Phillip or Jackalope.\n\nA view across the McLaren Vale region, with a peek at the Cube. JAKE EMEN\n\nTRIP EXTENSION: ADELAIDE & McLAREN VALE\n\nStay at the Mayfair Hotel, perfectly located within the cozyAdelaide Central Business District, but with grand stylings and creature comforts that would be at home in a city of any size. If there\u2019s time for only one dinner in town, head to Africola, every local\u2019s top choice, with fiery, flavorful dishes pairing African flavors with grilled and smoked preparations catering to both carnivores and vegetarians alike. For one more, visit the rooftop 2KW Bar & Restaurant, where you\u2019ll also find an excellent wine selection.\n\nIn McLaren Vale, plan your in-vineyard stay at Inkwell Wines, a sustainably minded operation from its vineyards to its construction, with off-grid energy production, and reclaimed materials, including buildings consisting of repurposed shipping containers. The onsite micro-hotel, dubbed Hotel California Rd., consists of three lavish suites with private decks and soaking tubs, allowing you to soak up endless, incredible views while downing delightful natural wines until your heart\u2019s content.\n\nThe region is planted predominantly with Shiraz, accounting for 60% of its vineyards, followed by Grenache, while white varieties are hardly present at all\u2014the largest contributor is Chardonnay, accounting for only 4% of its plantings. Visit Oliver 's Taranga, in a lovely position amid rolling hillside vineyards, where 6th generation Corinna Wright continues a tradition which began 180 years prior.\n\nYangarra is a full-estate operation boasting over 200 acres, all of which have been organic since 2012, while Wirra Wirra, founded in 1894, was one of the first seven wineries in the region. It was closed for three decades in the mid-20th century, before making a grand re-entrance spearheaded by a functional, medieval-sized trebuchet, useful for hurling watermelons afield while downing world class Shiraz.\n\nThe Cube is an art masterpiece and visitor center. JAKE EMEN\n\nThe d\u2019Arenberg visitor center-cum-art-masterpiece is The Cube, a wild fever dream sporting mind-bending architecture and interactive exhibits, art galleries, a stunning top floor bar, and several restaurants. The namesake d\u2019Arenberg Cube Restaurant serves as one of the most cutting-edge and in-demand tables in the country.\n\nThe writer was hosted by Wine Australia.", "description": "Wine tourism shows the best of Australia", "authors": ["Jake Emen"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-102792/social"}
