Gavin Newsom, is opening up about the challenges she faces not just as a working parent in the spotlight \u2014 but as a working mom.\n\n\u201c[D]espite our partnership and despite the support I feel in our relationship, I will always bear the responsibility of our children in a way Gavin never will,\u201d Jennifer, 45, wrote in the Oct. 10 piece.\n\nThe actress, documentarian and producer, a mother of four, detailed a list of the distinct challenges that most dads do not face: the unequal pay, the unequal emotional and logistic labor required in child care and the unequal stigma both at home (where men are rewarded for any parenting, she wrote, while women are criticized for any parenting slip-up) and at work (with mothers being seen as less committed while fathers are seen as more committed).\n\n\u201cIn other words, our culture doesn\u2019t punish parents so much as it punishes mothers, and especially working ones,\u201d Jennifer wrote.\n\nSince her husband took office, Jennifer has made championing gender equality a clear part of her role, which she has defined as California\u2019s \u201cfirst partner\u201d instead of first lady.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no timidity with Jen when it comes to things she cares about and causes she holds dear,\u201d Gov. Newsom, 52, said this summer, according to the Associated Press, which described how Jennifer had addressed El Salvador\u2019s president in Spanish during an April meeting to ask about women\u2019s rights there.\n\nWriting in Glamour, Jennifer pointed to her own experience after her husband became governor, when their toddler son, Dutch, went on stage with his dad in a viral moment for which she received some flack. She wrote: \u201cI \u2026 was asked by too many people to count\u2014in that half-joking but in fact quite serious tone\u2014how could I have possibly let him get up on that stage, and also, why did he still use a pacifier?!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really do ask women to do it all,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand then we don\u2019t even pay them for it.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Calif. Ends School Lunch-Shaming by Guaranteeing All Students Will Get a Meal\n\nJennifer was luckier than many other women, she wrote, given that \u201cworking in the feminist nonprofit realm\u201d meant having professional support for her motherhood that others did not receive.\n\nBut even her husband, a self-proclaimed feminist, \u201cstruggled,\u201d Jennifer wrote: \u201cOf course Gavin and I still haven\u2019t figured it all out.\u201d\n\nI struggle with balancing the words with deeds,\u201d he told reporters earlier this year, she wrote. \u201cI think this whole issue of the disparities is really about equal weight at home. That\u2019s a struggle, and it\u2019s a struggle for my wife. It\u2019s a struggle for spouses all across this country. And men don\u2019t fully appreciate [it], they really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nStill, Jennifer had reason to be optimistic, citing her husband\u2019s government\u2019s own work on this issue, including pushing for expanding paid maternity leave and an end to sales tax on diapers and menstrual products such as tampons.\n\n\u201c[P]erhaps there is hope; perhaps the tide is turning just a bit,\u201d Jennifer wrote.\n\nThe problems were clear \u2014 and part of the solution was acknowledging that.\n\n\u201cWe need equal pay. We need paid family leave. We need better and more affordable child care. But we also need to own up to the assumptions we make about women\u2019s work and a woman\u2019s place in the world,\u201d Jennifer wrote. \u201cWe need to see men as just as capable of parenting, and just as responsible for it as well.\u201d", "description": "Calif.
