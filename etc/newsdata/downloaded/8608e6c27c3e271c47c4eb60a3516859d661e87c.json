It's about to get worse (opinion)", "language": "en", "text": "Dan K. Eberhart is CEO of Canary, an independent oilfield services company in the United States. He has served as a consultant to the energy industry in North America, Asia and Africa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nWhile the full effects of the trade war between the United States and China have yet to hit the pocketbooks of most Americans, many parts of the US economy are feeling the pinch. Even with the preliminary trade deal reached last week, the oil and gas industry has been especially vulnerable.\n\nWhile Americans are working in US-based oil and gas fields to produce the energy that powers our homes, cars and factories, much of the equipment they use \u2014 the valves, compressors, well-heads and other parts \u2014 comes from China where it has always been cheaper. The escalating tariffs have increased the cost of importing equipment from China that oil service companies like mine depend on by as much as 25% \u2014 a significant amount in a low-margin business.\n\nThis has disrupted the global supply chain and forced US companies to find more affordable suppliers, mostly in Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries.\n\nWhile there has been no impact to date on US oil production, and thus no effect on prices at the pump, liquid natural gas export projects that have yet to secure long-term contracts are at risk because of the added cost of tariffs on the Chinese side. If US producers can't find export markets for their gas, they won't invest in new drilling, which will eventually lead to a reduction in US production.\n\nThe US price of oil is currently trading at around $54 a barrel \u2014 a precarious level for shale producers , who barely break-even at that price. Crude oil traded as high as $76 last October, before the trade war took off and energy commodities became a target.", "description": "As global demand for oil shrinks, America's oil producers find themselves locked out of the world's largest market for oil imports, writes Dan K.
