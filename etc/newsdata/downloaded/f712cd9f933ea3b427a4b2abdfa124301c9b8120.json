John Cornyn John CornynSuccession at DHS up in the air as Trump set to nominate new head Trying to kick tobacco again This week: Congress returns to chaotic Washington MORE (R-Texas), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, said the panel should focus on matters other than the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be my highest priority. We need limited bandwidth if we need to try to focus on getting things done, not contributing to the sideshow,\u201d Cornyn said.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyFarmers: New Trump ethanol proposal reneged on previous deal Overnight Energy: Farmers say EPA reneged on ethanol deal | EPA scrubs senators' quotes from controversial ethanol announcement | Perry unsure if he'll comply with subpoena | John Kerry criticizes lack of climate talk at debate Positive quotes from Iowa senators disappear from EPA's latest ethanol announcement MORE (R-Iowa), the previous chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said he would want to know exactly why Joe Biden needs to appear before the panel, seeing as how the former vice president is a leading candidate to win the Democratic nomination to face Trump next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d want to know what he wants to accomplish by bringing him before the committee,\u201d Grassley said of Graham.\n\nOn Wednesday, Graham said he hadn\u2019t made a decision on whether to call Joe or Hunter Biden before his committee, something Giuliani says is essential to pushing back against the impeachment effort by House Democrats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Graham said. \u201cRight now I want to see what the Intel Committee does.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the corruption in the Ukraine. I\u2019d like to hear from Rudy,\u201d Graham said, calling Giuliani the \u201cfoundational witness.\u201d\n\nGraham added that he might subpoena Giuliani if he declines an invitation to voluntarily appear before the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask him. If I see a need to subpoena him, I will,\u201d Graham said, adding that Giuliani would testify in an open session of the committee.\n\nThe remarks came amid an uncharacteristic public spat between Trump and Graham over the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria.\n\nAt one point, Trump said Graham should focus on investigating the 2016 election, with a focus on Obama administration officials. The president suggested he look into former President Obama, former CIA Director James Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyGraham on Syria: Trump appears 'hell-bent' on repeating Obama's mistakes in Iraq Trump hits back at Graham over Syria criticism Comey says he has a 'fantasy' about deleting his Twitter account after end of Trump term MORE and others, alleging they acted corruptly in the lead-up to his electoral victory.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Lindsey ought to focus on,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the people of South Carolina want him to focus on.\u201d\n\nWhether the fallout of that exchange will extend to possible Biden testimony is yet to be seen.\n\nGiuliani says that Biden and his son, who was paid as much as $50,000 a month to serve on the board of Burisma Holdings in Ukraine, should be called before Congress as part of the GOP\u2019s defense of Trump.\n\nGiuliani argues that Trump was acting in the nation\u2019s interest when he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call to investigate whether Biden played any role in thwarting a corruption investigation in Ukraine, which Giuliani believes was motivated by a desire to protect his son.\n\n\u201cIf I were in the House and I had subpoena power, my first witness would be Joe Biden for Trump because I would want to show the corruption that he unleashed in Ukraine that deprived us of the information that could have exonerated the president,\u201d Giuliani told The Hill last week. \u201cMy second witness would be Hunter.\u201d\n\nTrump and Giuliani have repeated unsubstantiated allegations that Biden acted corruptly in dealing with Ukraine. Giuliani believes Biden used his power as vice president to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son.\n\nGraham previously dismissed the idea of bringing Joe Biden before his panel, telling reporters that he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to turn the Senate into a circus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no interest in opening up that front. I don\u2019t want to blow up the Senate,\u201d he said last month.\n\nBut he changed his mind over the two-week October recess in reaction to what he viewed as an intensification of partisan tactics by House Democrats and their impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nGraham told Fox News\u2019s Bret Baier on Tuesday that he would \u201clook at\u201d calling Hunter Biden to testify if Giuliani first answered questions before the panel.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers have highlighted Hunter Biden\u2019s cushy post as a sign of possible corruption.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some real legitimate questions about what happened with Vice President Biden, Hunter Biden, what was happening over there ... I have a lot of questions that should be answered,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonSondland could provide more clues on Ukraine controversy 10 top Republicans who continue to deny the undeniable GOP braces for impeachment brawl MORE (R-Wis.), one of Trump\u2019s regular defenders, told reporters last month.\n\nBut now there\u2019s also a growing sense among GOP lawmakers that hauling Giuliani and Biden to testify under oath before a Senate committee could turn out to be a bad idea.\n\nFor one thing, it could put Giuliani in the uncomfortable position of having to answer questions from Democrats about how much influence he has as Trump\u2019s private lawyer over U.S.-Ukraine policy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s apparently, unbeknownst to all of us now, carrying out missions for the president of the United States and conducting foreign policy for the U.S. This was one of the many of the surprises of the last two weeks, to find out that Rudy Giuliani and this other guy are carrying out shadow foreign policy for the U.S.,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine Timothy (Tim) Michael Kaine2020 general election debates announced Senators call for Trump administration to testify on Syria Schumer: Transcript 'absolutely validates' Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (D-Va.), referring to Gordon Sondland, a hotelier and Trump donor who now serves as the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and who worked with Giuliani on investigating Ukrainian corruption.\n\nBringing Biden before the Judiciary Committee might also play into Democratic charges that Trump and his GOP allies have tried to use the power of the federal government to hamstring a political rival.\n\nAnd it could also further inflame partisan tensions and make it tougher to get regular business done, as Graham said he feared when speaking to reporters last month.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Wednesday warned that Graham needs to have a very strong reason to call on the Bidens to testify.\n\n\u201cThere should be a very strong reluctance to bring a presidential candidate who has no official position right now before the committee without a really strong basis, and I see no basis right now,\u201d he said.\n\nOther Republican members of the Judiciary panel on Wednesday said they would leave things up to Graham.\n\n\u201cI defer to the chairman there on what jurisdiction we have or don\u2019t have,\u201d said Sen.
