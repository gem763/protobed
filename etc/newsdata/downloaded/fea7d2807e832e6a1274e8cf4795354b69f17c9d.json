It was the first time Reading have led in a match since beating Huddersfield Town seven games ago.\n\nBowen has said that Reading are in a false position and on this evidence they certainly have some talented players, but knitting them together into a coherent whole may be his toughest task.\n\nPreston deserved a little better, but not much. They are the division\u2019s top scorers but only five of their 23 goals have come away from Deepdale. Here they looked confident and composed until they got within sight of the Reading goal.\n\nThey missed a good early chance to take the lead when defenders and attackers alike lost a dangerous cross from Andy Hughes in the sun, the ball bouncing safely into goalkeeper Rafael Cabral\u2019s hands off the chest of David Nugent. Then Ben Davies failed to make contact with a tempting free-kick from Paul Gallagher.", "description": "Reading 1 Preston North End 0", "authors": ["Nick Szczepanik"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000213523831-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrCS9JVgwgb8GODK1xmD4xnaevxlE17u3JxaYbxlOh1Q.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
