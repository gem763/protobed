Ominously for Trump, Graham said the level of support in Congress would make this \u201cveto-proof.\u201d\n\nThere were strongly worded condemnations from other senior Republicans. Senator Marco Rubio called a US Syria retreat \u201ca grave mistake,\u201d while Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s popular former UN ambassador, said leaving Kurds \u201cto die is a big mistake.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wisdom\u2019 and obliteration \u2013\n\nOften railing against the costly occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan and \u2014 despite his bellicose rhetoric \u2014 holding off from military strikes against Iran, Trump believes he is responding to public fatigue over seemingly intractable conflicts.\n\n\u201cThe United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days, that was many years ago,\u201d Trump said in one of his Monday tweets.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublican Rand Paul was one of the rare prominent voices backing Trump on \u201chis promises to stop our endless wars.\u201d\n\nBut even many of Trump\u2019s own allies appear to have run out of patience with what critics have long seen as a chaotic foreign policy.\n\nIn September, Trump made the stunning announcement that he\u2019d been on the verge of meeting Taliban guerrilla leaders to cap months of mostly behind-closed-doors negotiations on a US military exit after two decades of war.\n\nInstead, Trump said in the same statement \u2014 posted on Twitter \u2014 he was canceling those talks entirely.\n\nTrump has also kept the world on tenterhooks over his intentions in Iran, where he has given repeated mixed signals ranging from desire for historic talks to threatening war.\n\nTrump\u2019s former envoy on the campaign against the Islamic State group, Brett McGurk, did not hold back.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe sends military personnel into harm\u2019s way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Despite a bizarre boast about his \u201cunmatched wisdom,\u201d President Donald Trump found himself dangerously isolated", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/154484_us-president-donald-trump-has-angered-his-own-republican-allies-syria-pullout-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
