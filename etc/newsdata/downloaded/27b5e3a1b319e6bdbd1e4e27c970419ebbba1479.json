It\u2019s bad. Teachers and pupils feel that they have been misled by some of their representatives within the school structures and in the community,\u201d one parent told City Press this week. \u201cThere is that kind of regret. Things have deadlocked.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the stalemate, it is possible that pupils in the lower grades might not sit for their final exams if the Gauteng education authorities fail to quickly resolve the impasse.\n\nBut the Gauteng education department took a decision last Sunday to send the Grade 12s to a secluded camp in Pretoria to help them catch up on lost time.\n\nPart of their activities while there included focusing on:\n\nKey topics that have not been taught or sufficiently covered by their teachers, which are likely to be included in exams; and\n\nPupils were drilled in exam questions and exam response techniques as part of their exam preparations.\n\nThe school is currently closed, with security guards protecting the property.\n\nSteve Mabona, Gauteng education department spokesperson, was confident on Friday that the affected pupils would sit for their matric exams.\n\n\u201cThey will write at the school. In the event of anything happening, they will be bused out and taken to an operational centre,\u201d Mabona said.\n\n\u201cFor other grades, parents will have to assist us with what is it that they want. The head of department [Edward Mosuwe] will also have to follow legislative prescripts on what to do,\u201d Mabona said.\n\nCity Press visited the camp in Pretoria on Wednesday under strict conditions not to interact with pupils and staff but to observe.\n\nThe camp was quiet, an environment suited for learning and teaching.\n\nFor the duration of their stay, the pupils\u2019 day starts at 7am and they would study till late.\n\nThe pupils were split into eight classes as part of their original arrangement at the school. Boys and girls were allocated different dormitories monitored by six parents.\n\nThere were security guards at the facility with a remote-controlled access gate and outsiders could only enter at the approval of a dedicated personnel.\n\nPupils were scheduled to return to their homes today.\n\nA concerned parent said it was sad that their children had to be sent to a camp far from their homes and loved ones just because some adults decided to have a racial spat.\n\nThese children have to study coding and other subjects linked to artificial intelligence but there are parents who are not concerned about those things but racism-related stuff. It\u2019s a shame\n\n\u201cThis is not the way to raise children. Now, they will look back at this week and say this happened because of a black teacher in a coloured school and a coloured community that didn\u2019t want black teachers. This should not be happening.\u201d\n\nAnother parent said while the country was battling to catch up with the fourth industrial revolution, there were still parents concerned with the racial make-up of staff in schools.\n\n\u201cThese children have to study coding and other subjects linked to artificial intelligence but there are parents who are not concerned about those things but racism-related stuff. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nA third parent said it remained to be seen whether the last-minute intervention by the education authorities would bear any positive results for their children.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know to what extent this [disruption] has affected them. We don\u2019t know what will happen to others in lower grades,\u201d she said.\n\nThe first exams in Gauteng were also affected by this week\u2019s load shedding.\n\nMabona said nine candidates out of 1 224, who were scheduled to write information technology on Thursday, could not write and a concession would be sought with the department of basic education to reschedule.\n\nconcerned about the return of load shedding\n\nUmalusi, the body responsible for quality assurance of matric exams, on Thursday raised concerns about Eskom\u2019s decision to start load shedding during the exams.\n\nLucky Ditaunyane, Umalusi spokesperson, said they were concerned about the return of load shedding announced on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cSuch disruptions could potentially have a devastating effect on pupils and the integrity of exams, Ditaunyane said.\n\n\u201cWhile assessment bodies are required to put contingency plans in place to deal with emergency situations during the conduct of national examinations, Umalusi appeals to Eskom to consider the writing of national examinations when deciding on the schedule for electricity cuts.\u201d\n\nThe power utility\u2019s deputy spokesperson, Dikatso Mothae, said they were in constant communication with the education departments about their plans.\n\nEskom said on Friday that it understood the negative impact load shedding would have on customers, particularly matric exam candidates.\n\n\u201cIn order to lessen the disruption of exams, we will implement stage one load-shedding from 9am until midday and thereafter revert to stage two load shedding until 11pm,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThere were no reported incidents in most provinces by Friday afternoon, despite Umalusi\u2019s concerns last Thursday about the shortage of exam markers in the Eastern Cape for English (first additional language), physical science, life sciences and Afrikaans; in Western Cape for History paper two; and Northern Cape for agricultural sciences and Afrikaans.\n\nDitaunyane told City Press on Thursday that there were different reasons for the shortage from province to province.\n\n\u201cFor example, in the Eastern Cape they could not appoint a sufficient number of markers for English (first additional language) paper two because teachers chose to mark paper one and three when they applied for marking,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if these shortages could impact on the date of release of matric results, Ditaunyane said this won\u2019t be the case.\n\nThe department of basic education had not responded to questions sent on Thursday.\n\nThe Western Cape, with 53 395 full-time and 9 075 part-time candidates registered for the exams, was also hit by electricity outages.\n\nREAD: Eskom factors in matric exams as it implements stage 2 loadshedding\n\nBronagh Hammond, spokesperson for the department, said power cuts were problematic and affected centres for computer applications technology and information technology.\n\nHammond also said gangsterism and community protests remained major concerns.\n\n\u201cThe department has existing protocols in place to deal with a number of eventualities, such as electricity cuts. These protocols include ensuring that no pupil leaves the examination venue should the electricity be cut out, and that they are instead quarantined until electricity resumes and technical assistance is provided.\n\n\u201cPupils that would have already begun the exams will continue from where they left off once the electricity comes back on. There is an automatic save function so that pupils do not lose the work already completed in the event of an electrical shortage or malfunctioning.\n\n\u201cWe are working with law enforcement agencies in terms of intelligence regarding possible protest action or disruption in communities so we can make alternative arrangements should they be required,\u201d Hammond said.\n\nTALK TO US Do you think racism, gangsterism and community protests will affect integrity of 2019 matric results?
