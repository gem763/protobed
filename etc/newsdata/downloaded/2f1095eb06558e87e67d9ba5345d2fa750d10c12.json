They also pointed out that the photo shows Andrew and Giuffre around the same height, when in reality the prince is about nine inches taller than Giuffre.\n\n\u201cPrince Andrew does not recognize the photo. And the more you look at it, the odder it gets,\u201d an unnamed source told The Times. \u201cThe Duke is 6ft. Virginia Roberts Giuffre is 5ft 3in. There are certainly not nine inches between them. There is something decidedly wrong about it.\u201d\n\nGiuffre, now 35, claimed in her first televised interview on \u201cDateline NBC\u201d in September that she had sex with Prince Andrew in 2001 when she was 17 at Maxwell\u2019s London townhouse. She said Maxwell, who recruited her as Epstein\u2019s \u201csex slave,\u201d also propositioned her to the prince despite the royal knowing her age. Prince Andrew has vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nThe source said an analyst already claimed it was strange that Giuffre in the photo with Prince Andrew is wearing the \u201cexact same outfit\u201d she was when photographed two months later at a party in Saint-Tropez with supermodel Naomi Campbell.\n\nThe second photo in question shows Prince Andrew walking with Epstein in New York City\u2019s Central Park in 2010. The members of his inner circle said Andrew traveled to New York in 2010 to break off his friendship with Epstein when he was first accused of sexually abusing underage women. They claim Epstein orchestrated the photo to incriminate the prince.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen they went for that walk, it was a random act,\u201d the source told The Times. \u201cThe protection team never saw a photo being taken. The only way that it could have been taken is from a height. It is taken from an apartment looking down on the park. They were waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was pre-planned. Only Epstein knew where they were going to walk. The duke had no idea where he was going,\u201d the source said.", "description": "Prince Andrew enlisted a forensic team to analyze whether two photographs linking the British royal to disgraced financier and alleged human trafficker Jeffrey Epstein were doctored as part of an elaborate \u201cstitch-up\u201d scheme, according to a report published Sunday.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Andrew-Accuser.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
