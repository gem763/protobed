Not just the burglar bars and CCTV type of security, either: as cybercrime becomes more sophisticated by the day, businesses are struggling to secure their data and company infrastructures.\n\nEmail and data security company Mimecast has just released its 2019 State of Email Security Report \u2013 and the statistics are frankly frightening. Cybercrime is on the rise, and cybercriminals are constantly evolving their techniques to steal information and disrupt businesses.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning statistic is that people are still the weakest link in any corporate IT security system. Even in 2019, people are being tricked into clicking on fake links and email attachments, with dire consequences for their companies.\n\nMimecast\u2019s report found that impersonation attacks increased almost 70% compared to the previous year \u2013 and three-quarters of the affected companies experienced a direct loss, whether loss of customers (28%), financial loss (29%) or data loss (40%).\n\nSeems the old tricks still work the best for criminals. Ransomware, phishing and social engineering are all on the rise, with phishing attacks the most prominent type of cyberattack. 94 percent of Mimecast\u2019s respondents experienced phishing and spear phishing attacks in the previous 12 months, and 55 percent saw an increase in phishing attacks over the same period.\n\nTo make things worse, nation state politics have entered the picture and are complicating things even further. A year ago, few people would have thought that going with a specific platform would potentially compromise their security. Today, you don\u2019t even know if you can trust your hardware vendor anymore.\n\nSo how do businesses deal with an increasingly diverse threat landscape? Step one is to focus on your people. Until every person in a company understands how and why they have to protect the corporate IT assets, systems and data, businesses will remain vulnerable to attack. You need to create a culture of security with a multi-layered, holistic defence system that covers people, policies and procedures.\n\nStep two is to lose the silos. Many businesses that we see still adopt a patchwork approach, with different applications from different suppliers tacked together loosely to try and combat different threats: a firewall from one supplier, an anti-virus from another. This isn\u2019t just bad security. It\u2019s bad business.\n\nAnd step three is to hire an expert to help you keep IT security costs down through a holistic, intelligent approach to security. This frees you up to focus on your core business, while reducing business disruptions and even taking advantage of new opportunities.\n\nDaniel Lotter is Head of Innovation at Itec South Africa.
