RIGHT?), you should probably have sorted your holiday plans by now \u2013 but if you\u2019ve left it until the last minute, here\u2019s what you need to do to ensure that you don\u2019t miss out on that well-earned break.\n\nHow much will a new passport cost?\n\nA standard 34-page adult passport costs \u00a375.50, a jumbo 50-page adult passport costs \u00a385.50, a child\u2019s passport costs \u00a349 and for those born before 2 September 1929 can obtain passports for free.

You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nRenewing or replacing an adult passport\n\nIf you\u2019re in the UK you can renew or replace your passport and change the details on your passport. This should take approximately three weeks, but may take longer if your application hasn\u2019t been completed correctly.\n\nYou can track your passport application immediately if you apply online, or after three weeks if you apply by post.\n\nYour new passport will be sent to you by courier or Royal Mail. They\u2019ll either post it through your letterbox, hand it to you if you\u2019re at home, or leave a card or post a letter saying how you can get it (it won\u2019t state the package is your passport).\n\nHow to renew or replace a passport urgently\n\nMany countries now require visitors to have at least six months validity on their passport before entering the country. These include popular destinations such as Singapore, Mexico, Canada, China, Thailand and Brazil. Before booking your holiday, it\u2019s always worth checking with your destination country\u2019s consulate or the UK\u2019s Foreign Office advice to double-check any entry requirements, as these can change.\n\nIf you\u2019ve booked your flights and made the horrifying discovery that you don\u2019t have enough time remaining on your passport, fear not. You\u2019re not alone, and there are a number of options available to you.\n\nFirstly, you\u2019ll need to book a passport office appointment, attend in person and pay online; appointments can be booked up to three weeks in advance. However, bear in mind there are some situations where you can\u2019t get a same day passport renewal, such as if your passport is deemed too damaged.\n\nFast-track options include:\n\nPaper premium\n\nWith this service, you usually get your new passport four hours after your appointment. You can use this service to renew an adult passport or change the name on your passport (providing you can produce the relevant documentation, such as a marriage certificate). This option costs \u00a3177.\n\nOnline premium\n\nThis option enables you to get your new passport at your appointment. Appointments last up to 30 minutes and you can use this service to renew an adult passport. Bear in mind that the earliest you can get an appointment is two days from when you apply. This option costs \u00a3177.\n\nOne week fast track\n\nThis service delivers a new passport to your home within one week of your appointment, which means someone might need to be home to sign for it. This option costs \u00a3142 for a standard adult passport or \u00a3122 for a child\u2019s passport. You can use this option to:\n\nRenew an adult or child passport\n\nChange your name on your passport\n\nMake changes to your personal details, such as your gender\n\nReplace a lost, stolen or damaged passport\n\nApply for a first child passport\n\nIf you\u2019ve already applied for a passport, you may be able to upgrade an existing passport application in exceptional circumstances. Call the passport advice line on 0300 222 0000 for more information.\n\nWhere are the passport offices based?\n\nThere are passport customer service centres in Belfast, Durham, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, Newport and Peterborough.\n\nHow to get your first UK passport\n\nIf you\u2019ve never left the UK\u2019s green and pleasant lands until now, how exciting! You must have British nationality to be eligible for a UK passport, which will be valid for 10 years. Getting your first passport should take about six weeks, according to government guidance, but it can take longer. The first rule of obtaining, renewing or replacing your passport: leave sufficient time.\n\nThere are three ways to apply for your first passport. Whichever route you take, you\u2019ll be asked some personal details such as:\n\nName, date and place of birth, your address and contact details\n\nDetails of any existing passports you hold\n\nDetails to confirm your British nationality, such as details about your parents or grandparents, or information from your naturalisation or registration certificate\n\nOnline applicants will need a debit or credit card to pay the \u00a375.50 fee and the facilities to print the declaration form, which will require signing and posting.\n\nAs with passport renewals and replacements, you\u2019ll be charged \u00a385 if you want to make a paper application, with forms available from your local post office.\n\nFinally, you can contact the passport advice line to get a form posted to you.\n\nPhotos and documents required\n\nYou must include two identical photographs with your passport application. There are stringent rules to comply with when identifying suitable passport photos, details of which you can find here.\n\nYou must also include supporting documentation, such as birth certificates, details of which you can find here.\n\nCountersigned applications\n\nThere are some circumstances where your application form and photos require a countersignature \u2013 the signature of someone else who can prove your identity. You must get these signed if you\u2019re applying for the following:\n\nFirst adult passport\n\nFirst child passport\n\nReplacement for a lost, stolen or damaged passport\n\nRenewal of a passport for a child aged 11 or under\n\nRenewal of a passport if your appearance has changed and you can\u2019t be recognised from your existing passport\n\nYour countersignatory must:\n\nHave known the person applying for at least two years\n\nBe able to identify the person applying, for example, a friend, neighbour or colleague, not just someone who knows them professionally\n\nBe \u201ca person of good standing in their community\u201d or work in (or be retired from) a recognised profession\n\nYour countersignatory must not:\n\nBe related by birth or marriage\n\nBe in a relationship with, or live at the same address as, the person applying\n\nBy signing your form, your countersignatory is confirming that the details are correct, you\u2019re who you claim to be and that the information you\u2019ve provided on the form is correct.\n\nOn the back of one of your passport photos, your countersignatory should write:\n\n\u201cI certify that this is a true likeness of [title and full name of adult or child who is applying for the passport]\u201d.\n\nThey must then sign and date underneath this statement. The passport applicant does not have to sign or date the photos.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that HM Passport Office may contact your countersignatory for more information and that your application may be delayed if they\u2019re unavailable, for example if they\u2019re on holiday.\n\nPassport check and send service\n\nSome post offices can check your passport application to ensure that all the correct sections have been completed, that you have all the supporting documents and that you have paid the correct fee \u2013 this is called \u2018check and send\u2019. You can only use this if you have completed a paper application. Your application will then be sent to HM Passport Office special delivery and is usually faster than posting your own application. There is a \u00a39.75 fee for this service, in addition to the cost of your passport.\n\nFor all other information about obtaining a passport, including cancelling a lost or stolen passport or applying for a child\u2019s passport, head to the government\u2019s webpage.\n\nBon voyage!", "description": "With sun-filled days imminent (right?
