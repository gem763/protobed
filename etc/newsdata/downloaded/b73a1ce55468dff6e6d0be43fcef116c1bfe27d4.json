In a new commentary, BlackRock\u2019s Investment Institute points out that financial conditions have eased as central banks, including the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, have cut interest rates.\n\nThe orange line shows the rate of GDP growth implied by its financial conditions indicator, based on its historical relationship with its growth GPS, shifted forward 180 days.\n\nThat\u2019s going to have an effect, and BlackRock says it\u2019s already starting to see signs of its impact, as the U.S. housing market appears to have turned a corner, auto sales have held up and machinery investment has rebounded in Europe. BlackRock says it expects a pickup in global economic growth in the next six to 12 months.\n\nBlackRock isn\u2019t entirely bullish \u2014 they point out the German economy is still struggling and increasingly protectionist trade policies are a key driver of global markets and the economy.

It\u2019s overweight euro-area sovereign bonds because of their relatively steeper yield curve, and it sees government bonds as important portfolio stabilizers.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -0.55% has climbed 19% this year, and the iShares JPMorgan USD emerging market bond exchange traded fund EMB, -0.18% has gained 8%.", "description": "Thanks to central bank easing, the global economy should accelerate, BlackRock says.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS391_port_o_ZG_20191001094830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
