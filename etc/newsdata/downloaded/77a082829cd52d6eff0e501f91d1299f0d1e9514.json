The spooky spokesman chants in the video, \u201cI call on the waters of Liquid Death and curse it with a witch\u2019s breath. . . Curse this place, invade this product, invade those who would consume.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the incantation a disclaimer adds, \u201cLiquid Death is not responsible for what the demons do to you if you decide to consume it.\u201d\n\nThere is an irony to all the hocus pocus. Despite its punk-rock sensibility, wild brand aesthetics with cans featuring melting skulls and medieval-style fonts as well as a slogan that states \"Murder, Your Thirst,\" Liquid Death is actually a healthy water product.\n\nOn its web site, Liquid Death states: \"Let's be clear. Liquid Death is a completely unnecessary approach to bottled water. In fact, we strive to be unnecessary in everything we do. Because unnecessary things tend to be far more interesting, fun, hilarious, captivating, memorable, exciting, and cult-worthy than 'necessary' things.\"\n\nThe \"About Us\" section goes on to ask: \"We started Liquid Death with the totally evil plan to make people laugh and get more of them to drink more water more often . . . Why should unhealthy products be the only brands with \u201cpermission\u201d to be loud, fun, and weird?\n\nAnother difference is the \"bottled water\" comes not in plastic containers, but rather 16.9-ounce tallboy cans -- those usually reserved for beer or not so healthy energy drinks. The 10-month old company works with the Thirst Project and 5 Gyres to donate a nickel from every can sold to help remove plastic garbage from oceans and provide drinking water to dry and impoverished areas.\n\n\u201cAs crazy as the name is, it just also made so much sense for what the product mission is: to kill your thirst and help bring death to plastic bottles,\u201d Cessario told Marketing Daily in a recent interview.\n\nThe 100% natural, non-carbonated spring water from a private, underground source in Frankenmarkt, Austria is beginning to make its push into retail stores. It is readily available for direct sale on its web site as well as Amazon.\n\nA former Netflix promotional creator behind such advertisement campaigns as \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cNarcos,\u201d and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d Cessario has made it a point to create a unique brand with the noble mission of ridding the world of unnecessary plastic use.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to make health and sustainability more fun and not take itself too seriously,\u201d said Cessario.\n\nLiquid Death raised $1.6 million in May bringing its total funding to $2.25 million. The wacky startup brand 's investors include Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and Jen Rubio, co-founder of suitcase-making company Away.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "A former Netflix promo creator has started his own bottled water startup that appeals to alternative-minded consumers intent on avoiding plastic.", "authors": ["Matthew Mcnulty"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/12-pack-hero_600x600_467029aa-abd7-482c-81ba-4bd38067c8b8_1080x.png?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
