Pai first proposed in March 2018 barring companies that posed a national security risk from receiving funds from the FCC's Universal Service Fund, but did not name Huawei or ZTE. The fund provides subsidies to provide service in rural or hard-to-reach areas, and to libraries and schools.\n\nFCC Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel noted the action was coming after 18 months of review and the FCC should take additional actions.\n\n\"We need to be mindful that in a global economy, our networks will still connect to insecure equipment abroad. So we should start researching how we can build networks that can withstand connection to equipment vulnerabilities around the world,\" Rosenworcel said.\n\nThe FCC argues the companies' ties to the Chinese government and military apparatus, and Chinese laws requiring that such companies assist the Chinese government with intelligence activities, pose a US national security risk.\n\nThe US Congress has been considering legislation to authorise up to $1bn for small and rural wireless providers to replace network equipment from the Chinese companies. The FCC could tap the fund itself to pay for replacing equipment if Congress does not act.\n\nAbout a dozen rural US telecom carriers that depend on inexpensive Huawei and ZTE switches and equipment were in discussions with Ericsson and Nokia to replace their Chinese equipment, the Reuters news agency reported in June.\n\nThe US has been pressing nations not to grant Huawei access to 5G networks and alleged Huawei\u2019s equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied.\n\nPai said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Monday that \"China could compel Huawei to spy on American individuals and businesses. Imagine if a 5G network with Huawei equipment were operating near a US military installation, critical infrastructure facility or other sensitive location.\"\n\nHe also cited a report by cybersecurity firm Finite State that \"found a majority of the Huawei firmware images it analysed had at least one potential back door and that each Huawei device had an average of 102 known vulnerabilities.\"\n\nSeveral European countries in recent months have not agreed to bar Huawei, despite intense US pressure.\n\nIn May, US President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited executive order declaring a national emergency and barring US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The order directed the Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October. The Commerce Department has yet to publish a plan.\n\nThe US government added Huawei to a trade blacklist in May, saying the Chinese company was involved in activities contrary to US national security.\n\nMore than 130 US firms requested licences to sell to Huawei in August, which they have yet to receive.", "description": "The US telecom regulator wants to classify the Chinese firms as national security risks, affecting rural US carriers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/7/30/ba33a9f26ee74e4498252ce79414aa49_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
