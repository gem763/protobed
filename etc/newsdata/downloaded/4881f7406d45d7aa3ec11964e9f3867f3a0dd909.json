The only difference: the real games were still weeks away and here was Beal, already fuming at a young center on a team with low expectations entering the 2019-20 season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNine days later, Beal agreed to a two-year, $72 million contract extension with the Wizards. He signed up for more frustration. But why?\n\n***\n\nOn Wednesday night, Beal, 26, will begin his eighth season in Washington. It could become his first all-NBA campaign, as he will have plenty of opportunity to stand out without fellow all-star John Wall, who missed much of last year and could miss most or all of this season due to an Achilles\u2019 injury. Instead, Beal will be the cornerstone of a rebuilding project.\n\n\u201cI know it won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Beal said recently.\n\nWhen the Wizards open the 2019-20 season against the Dallas Mavericks, Beal will potentially be surrounded six players in the rotation who are 22 years old or younger. Bryant, second-year pro Troy Brown Jr. and rookie Rui Hachimura are considered hard-working youngsters the team will eventually build a core around but their development wanes in comparison to Beal, the first guard left off last year\u2019s all-NBA honor roll despite being the first player in franchise history to average at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists in a season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom the outside, things look bleak. ESPN\u2019s Stephen A. Smith recently assailed the current state of the Wizards without Wall, and declared it might be \u201cthe worst starting five in the last 20 years.\u201d This week, the statistical website FiveThirtyEight gave Washington only a 20 percent chance of making the playoffs. No Wizards player or coach even earned a shout-out in the NBA.com annual GM survey.\n\nFor the Wizards, and their leader, there are rough days ahead. But by committing to the upcoming rebuild, Beal, whose current deal now totals four years and $130 million, has bought into the vision the Wizards have pitched.\n\n\u201cThey kind of projected the future and kind of gave me a layout of what we can do in the future and it looked promising for me, to put me in a position to have a little bit of control in that as well,\u201d Beal said. \u201cI was honored by that because again you don\u2019t get that type of position, that type of power. I\u2019m taking advantage of it and now here I am.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n***\n\nConvincing Beal took time. It began in April when he met with Tommy Sheppard in exit meetings. Sheppard then still held the interim general manager title, after replacing longtime president of basketball operations Ernie Grunfeld. The full-time job wasn\u2019t promised to him but Sheppard listened to Beal\u2019s concerns with the intention of solving every one of them like an executive ready to woo his franchise star.\n\nWithout a second star like Wall, Beal often faced the brunt of an opponent\u2019s defense. He needed more offensive sets and packages to get better looks.\n\n\u201cI want players who want to get better and challenge me to get better and he\u2019s one. Give him credit. Three years ago, he couldn\u2019t do what he\u2019s doing now,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cHe\u2019s really developed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBrooks has found new flexibility from Beal\u2019s improvement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can put him in any situation and he understands it at a high level,\u201d he said. \u201cI can use him as a decoy and he understands why I\u2019m using him as a decoy. I can use him in pick-and-rolls and pin downs and in the post.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards further addressed those on-court needs by adding more resources to the coaching staff with four new assistants, including an analytics specialist in Dean Oliver. Other franchises have someone like Oliver on the staff, but the Wizards gave him the title of coach, showing their commitment to analytics.\n\nBeal also wanted to see more accountability. Last year, during a practice that went off the rails, he blew his fuse and directed some anger at Grunfeld. Over the last few seasons, the atmosphere around the team has been described as \u201ctoo much drama\u201d by a Wizards front office executive. A player like Beal, who had remained patient while the team brought in veteran relief on short-term or costly deals for quick fixes, wanted more stability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis summer, the Wizards made those intentional moves to firm up the roster and salary cap. They refused to overpay their own free agents, and sprinkled in a few serious-minded veterans in Isaiah Thomas, Ish Smith and CJ Miles to bolster the youth movement.\n\nThe things Beal felt the team needed to change structurally were valued. Even more, Ted Leonsis listened \u2014 to Beal as well as his representative Mark Bartelstein. In July, when Leonsis announced sweeping changes to the organizational structure, one of the constant advisers for the newly-formed Monumental Basketball was Bartelstein.\n\nThroughout the summer, Beal and his agent spoke \u201cdaily,\u201d Bartelstein recalled, about the consequences of re-upping with the Wizards: The losses \u2014 there will be a lot of them \u2014 and the exasperation that comes with rising to new personal heights while young teammates are teetering in their development. Ultimately, Beal wanted to be at the head of a table. He saw the steps the Wizards were taking and wanted to lead the way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe knows a lot of people are talking about sort of the downturn that the Wizards may go through as they kind of restructure and regroup here,\u201d Bartelstein said. \u201cHe kind of wants to choose his own path and not necessarily jump on someone else\u2019s bandwagon but to be the reason Washington becomes a destination for anyone wanting to play for the Wizards. That was his ultimate dream was to stay here and be a part of this.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a different cat,\u201d Bartelstein said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really concern [himself] with what other people are doing and choices other guys are making.\u201d\n\n***\n\nBeal must have a trigger when it comes to practice. During an Oct. 2 session while players scrimmaged four-on-four, Bryant tried shooting a jumper over a smaller defender instead of posting him up and Beal, again, took offense.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re 6-9! He\u2019s 6-2!\u201d Beal barked, reminding Bryant of the height difference. As he turned away, Beal punctuated his annoyance with an expletive.\n\nAD\n\nThis was just the second practice of the season, a brief scene that played out in front of media. Behind closed doors, however, Beal hasn\u2019t always been the old man shaking his fists at young folks. He\u2019s said he wants to \u201csave his bullets\u201d and recognize when it\u2019s time to stop yelling and start motivating.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s practice, while Beal played on the team with Hachimura, Smith and second-year forward Isaac Bonga, he pumped his guys with confidence by sharing the ball and taking only about three shots the whole scrimmage.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe has to be able to get on guys. He got on [Bryant] a couple weeks ago and it\u2019s part of developing a team. I\u2019m sure Paul Pierce was on him when he was a younger player. That\u2019s part of the progression as you get into the league and you develop as a player and a team. But you can\u2019t do it every day,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cLike [on Sunday], he was all encouraging today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLast Thursday, after Beal put pen to paper on his contract extension, he was steady while standing in front of reporters. No tirades about defense or boxing out. He calmly explained why he chose to stick around. He used a loaded word like \u201clegacy\u201d and fashioned himself as a someone who loves winning but can wait, as well.\n\nHe\u2019s ready for the rebuild. After all, Beal signed up for this.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019ll be a challenge but that\u2019s just kind of how I\u2019ve always been built,\u201d Beal said. \u201cJust kind of pushed to things and pushed to limits and overcoming things people think I probably couldn\u2019t do.\u201d", "description": "Beal bought into the Wizards' vision.
