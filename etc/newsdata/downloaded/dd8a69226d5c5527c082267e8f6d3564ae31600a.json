Quote that. Period. Elena, you the best power forward in the world!\u201d Cloud said.\n\nWhen Delle Donne thanked her from across the room, Cloud replied, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Baa.\u201d\n\nCloud then looked ahead to the fall, when the Mystics were certain to be one of the top teams in the WNBA playoffs.\n\n\u201cEven when I signed back this year, my first thing (I said) to Elena was, \u2018I\u2019m gonna get you a championship,\u2019\u201d Cloud said. \u201cI think that\u2019s super important, and for Coach too. But for this team. We all know this is a championship team but nothing\u2019s gonna be given to us. We have to go out and take it.\u201d\n\nNow that their record-setting regular season is complete, it\u2019s time for the Mystics to walk the walk. Washington is the No. 1 seed and the favorite to win the WNBA championship \u2014 which would be the franchise\u2019s first title in 22 years of existence, the first in Delle Donne\u2019s career and the first for coach Mike Thibault, the winningest coach in league history.\n\nClearly, the stakes are high for everyone involved, one year removed from the Mystics\u2019 3-0 series loss to the Seattle Storm in the WNBA Finals.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be happy if we come away short,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cThat\u2019s tough, to have a really great season like this and know that if we won\u2019t get a championship, we won\u2019t be happy. That shows that our goals are super lofty. Everybody\u2019s ready. We\u2019re gonna take a nice rest. We earned it, we deserve it, but then we\u2019ve gotta come back and prepare for a brand-new season.\u201d\n\nAround Delle Donne is a strong core that includes Cloud, LaToya Sanders and key rotational players Tianna Hawkins, Emma Meesseman and Aerial Powers. The latter two are among the Mystics\u2019 four leading scorers (Meesseman averages 13.1 points per game, Powers adds 11.4) despite usually coming off the bench.\n\nThe main question mark the Mystics face is the health of All-Star guard Kristi Toliver, who has sat for four weeks with a knee injury. A healthy Toliver could make a great Mystics team even more dominant in the postseason. Thibault said Sunday that Toliver is able to shoot again and may return to practice by the end of this week. They aim to have Toliver ready a few days before Game 1, but that is no guarantee.\n\nSo what lies ahead? Earning the top seed gave Washington a break until Sept. 17 and 19, when it will host Games 1 and 2 of one league semifinal series. The first two win-or-go-home rounds will determine the Mystics\u2019 opponent; the lower-seeded team still standing after two rounds will play Washington.\n\nThe most likely opponent is the fourth-seed Las Vegas Aces (21-13), who earlier this year jockeyed with Washington and the Connecticut Sun for first position in the league before losing star A\u2019ja Wilson to an injury for a portion of the season. The Mystics could also draw the No. 5 Chicago Sky (20-14), whom they just beat in Sunday\u2019s regular season finale.\n\nThere\u2019s an outside shot that the eighth seed Phoenix Mercury could win its first two games and meet the Mystics in the semis. Despite Phoenix\u2019s 15-19 regular season record, it\u2019s not a matchup Washington would desire. The Mystics had little success guarding Mercury center Brittney Griner when they played in the regular season, with Griner even defeating constant double-teams to drop 30 points on them in a game in July.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t take away from the Mystics\u2019 reputation as the best team in the WNBA right now.\n\n\u201cWhen you win 16 out of your last 18, I guess you\u2019d have to say you\u2019re on an upward trend,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cHopefully the layoff doesn\u2019t give us too much rest, but we\u2019re gonna try to balance out rest and workouts this week.\u201d\n\nSingle-game playoff tickets go on sale Tuesday at 2 p.m. A package that includes tickets for all playoff games is also available.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
