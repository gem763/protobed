Impeachment fight riles up Donald Trump supporters for 2020", "language": "en", "text": "As the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump rapidly unfolds in Washington, the president is venting his frustration at campaign rallies where his attacks on House Democrats and the media are serving to further energize his supporters.\n\nTrump, facing impeachment over allegations he improperly used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political enemies, is rousing his devotees on the road rather than hunkering down at home. He has derided the accusations as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nWhile Trump has faced intense criticism in Washington over the Ukraine scandal and his abrupt pullout of U.S. troops from Syria, he has reveled in the rock-star reception he has received at rallies thousands of miles away in Minneapolis and Dallas.\n\nSupporters echo the president's attacks on impeachment, House Democrats and what Trump calls the \"swamp\" of Washington, D.C. Like the president, they view impeachment as an illegitimate effort to take him down and defend his phone call with Ukraine's president in which he pushed for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a top political rival. Impeachment, many said, will wind up re-electing Trump in 2020.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. More\n\nJames Wilson, 47, a payroll manager in Rowlett who grabbed a front-row seat at Trump's rally in the Dallas sports arena Thursday, said impeachment was just another in a long line of attacks including special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut he likened it to a \"boomerang.\"\n\n\"Every time the other side throws something, it comes back and it hits them,\" Wilson said.\n\nIt will never stop, he said.\n\n\"The Democrats don't want him in,\" Wilson said. \"They're going to do everything they can \u2013 legally and illegally \u2013 to get him out. But they're going to lose in 2020.\"\n\n'The swamp is fighting back'\n\nIt's not just Democrats going after Trump, supporters said; it's also members of what the president calls \"deep state\" of the government bureaucracy.\n\n\"I think the swamp is fighting back and they're going down hard,\" said Mary Shea, 65, a retiree from Houston who waited for hours to get into the Dallas arena.\n\n\"I don't think he did anything that most other presidents haven't done,\" she said. \"All presidents cut around the corners.\"\n\nThe impeachment inquiry centers on Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky, in which he repeatedly urged him to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma, an energy company in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nTrump supporters slammed his accusers.\n\n\"That's a bunch of guilty people trying to keep their crooks covered up,\" said Naomi Hodgkins, 64, a semi-retired business consultant from nearby Mesquite, Texas, who wore a button that said \"Trump 2020: No More Bullshit.\"\n\n\"They're doing a psychological transference of their guilt to him ... The Biden thing is going to go real deep.\"\n\nOrigins of a conspiracy: Trump's conspiracy theories thrive in Ukraine, where a young democracy battles corruption and distrust\n\nHodgkins' sentiment was echoed among the president's supporters hundreds of miles north in Minneapolis, where Trump held a rally on Oct. 10, his first campaign event since the impeachment inquiry was announced on Sept. 24.\n\nImpeachment signs sailed above crowds outside the downtown arena, where protesters blew whistles and beat drums in the rain along Minneapolis' First Avenue. Dallas saw its own share of protesters thrusting similar impeachment signs into the air.\n\nSupporters react as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a More", "description": "Rather than hunkering down in Washington, Donald Trump is using the impeachment fight to rile up supporters in cities like Minneapolis and Dallas.", "authors": ["Courtney Subramanian", "David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RiHziRiBd.HHEh1yG.BjoQ--~B/aD0yNDM4O3c9Mzg0MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/d50e752f4a1db8277fe258ab136feb96", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
