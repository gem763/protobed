That's where the injury bug reared its head once more and came for one of the team's most important players this postseason.\n\nCloser Aroldis Chapman had recorded the final three outs of the series earlier, but reporters encountered him with a large bandage on his left hand \u2014 his pitching hand. Through an interpreter, he told the New York Post a bottle hit him during the locker-room jubilation.\n\n\"I was just celebrating and everyone was jumping around,\" Chapman told the Post. \"I got hit with a bottle, but it\u2019s fine.\"\n\nYankees general manager Brian Cashman said he fist-bumped his closer on the bandaged hand.\n\n\"I saw it when he walked by,\" Cashman said, according to NJ.com. \"It\u2019s a question on my mind. You know what he did? He gave me a fist-bump with the wrap on his wrist. So, I was like, what\u2019s that? But they were all going out on the field and he had a huge smile on his face. So I have no answer as to what that is. But I fist-bumped it.\"\n\nAnother Yankees left-handed reliever, Zack Britton, had to leave in the eighth inning with an ankle injury. He told reporters \"I'll be fine.\"\n\nThe Yankees will take on the winner of the ALDS matchup between the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay Rays. That series continues with Game 4 on Tuesday.", "description": "New York Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman had his left hand wrapped after a bottle hit it during a postgame celebration after team's ALDS sweep.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/08/USAT/4e6add02-3a1d-4d37-9303-8204a57d775a-Chapman_hand.JPG?crop=1754,2339,x1,y208&width=1558&height=2339&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
