We scored in the last seconds and it was a very good goal, so I\u2019m very happy,\u201d said Ben Yedder.\n\nThe late goal means they are now level on 12 points with Toulouse, Amiens and 12th-placed Rennes, who have not won a match since August.\n\nClaude Puel continued his perfect start as Saint-Etienne coach.\n\nDenis Bouanga\u2019s stoppage time penalty at Bordeaux launched Puel\u2019s side into the top half of the table.\n\nThe 10-time French champions were second-bottom in Ligue 1 after their home loss to Metz late last month but have won three straight, the last two under Puel.\n\nTheir turnaround in form, which includes victory over local rivals Lyon in Puel\u2019s first match, has moved them to 10th place.\n\nBordeaux meanwhile missed the chance to move into the Champions League positions with their second home loss on the bounce.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Marseille ended a four-match winless streak\u00a0in Ligue 1 on Sunday after Boubacar Kamara\u2019s early strike and a late Kevin Strootman", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/d47543_boubacar-kamara-early-opener-marseille-was-his-goal-season-marseille-end-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
