The school officials initially blocked off the area and called the police.\n\nThe Sheriff of the county, Leo Dutton, told The Associated Press news agency that no threats had been made to the school prior to the incident.\n\nNo suspect or motive was immediately identified.\n\n\"There's a lot of unanswered questions,\" Dutton said. \"We're going through it methodically and slowly, so we don't miss something.\"\n\nAll schools in the Helena and East Helena districts were briefly placed on lockdown as they were searched by law enforcement Tuesday morning. They were all cleared of danger shortly after.\n\nDutton said the state Capitol and government buildings were also searched as a precaution.\n\nThe FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Montana Highway Patrol were assisting the sheriff and Helena police officials in the investigation.", "description": "Authorities said no one was injured when an already playground shortly before classes started.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/15/c1cba470d7304c93b443fd0ab3045c78_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
