Michelle Lujan Grisham last month proposed free tuition for residents at state universities.\n\nThe influx of cash, though, hasn\u2019t stopped her administration from embracing one of the fossil-fuel industry\u2019s biggest threats: the climate-change movement.\n\nBehind the scenes, the governor\u2019s staff is working closely with national climate groups seeking to phase-out natural gas in power plants, transportation, even homes, according to emails obtained by the free-market Energy Policy Advocates.\n\nNot only is New Mexico part of the 25-state U.S. Climate Alliance, but state officials participated in an off-the-record blue-state conference in July held by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a Keystone XL pipeline foe and advocate for fossil-fuel divestment, where topics included how to \u201creduce and eliminate petroleum and natural gas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe top line Challenge-Opportunity is to move away from the use of natural gas in buildings as a first priority, then electricity, and industry, while simultaneously moving quickly to move transportation systems off petroleum,\u201d said a background memo for the meeting at the RBF\u2019s Pocantico Center in New York.\n\nThe involvement of New Mexico, where the development of the oil-rich Permian Basin has led to a $900 million budget surplus, illustrates the unique economic and political challenges for the rare \u201ctrifecta\u201d blue state \u2014 one where Democrats control the governor\u2019s mansion and both legislative houses.\n\nMs. Lujan Grisham credited fossil fuels Tuesday for making her free-tuition plan possible, saying the boom has provided \u201csignificant resources\u201d to the small state.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very good situation currently \u2014 oil and gas, we\u2019re an extractive industry state, and so we\u2019re seeing a billion dollars in revenue,\u201d she told MSNBC.\n\nPaul Gessing, president of the free-market Rio Grande Foundation in Albuquerque, said the Democratic governor finds herself in a \u201ctricky spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a whole laundry list of things she wants to spend the money on, but she wants to kind of play footsie with the radical left,\u201d Mr. Gessing said. \u201cShe\u2019s in a bit of a tricky spot, and it\u2019s unfortunate and disturbing that she\u2019s sending people up to New York to meet with some of these really radical voices on these issues.\u201d\n\nThe only comparable state would be Colorado, a far wealthier state with a diverse economy better able to withstand Gov. Jared Polis\u2019s recent crackdown on fracking. In New Mexico, the industry accounts for at least 35% of the state budget.\n\n\u201cGov. Lujan Grisham\u2019s administration, while rhetorically embracing the energy industries that not only employ thousands of New Mexicans but underwrite so much of that state\u2019s public services including education, is quietly working with activists to kill that golden goose,\u201d said Chris Horner, an attorney who represents Energy Policy Advocates in numerous open-records cases.\n\n\u201cHer staff are being flown across the country to New York \u2014 to sit in apparently frigid air conditioning at the old Rockefeller place \u2014 to plot the demise of these industries specifically targeted in the activists\u2019 own memos sent to staff,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Even-handed and collaborative\u2019\n\nLujan Grisham spokesman Tripp Stelnicki denied that she has worked at cross-purposes with the state\u2019s top industry, citing the governor\u2019s recent summit on industry technology and innovation in Santa Fe, which was co-hosted by Descartes Labs and attended by the Permian Basin Petroleum Association as well as environmentalists.\n\n\u201cThe Lujan Grisham administration has been even-handed and collaborative in its approach to the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Mr. Stelnicki.\n\nMr. Gessing agreed that the Democratic governor took a \u201chands off\u201d approach during the legislative session, signing a renewable energy standard of 50% by 2030 for electricity utilities but taking no action against producers.\n\nA week ago, however, she unveiled aggressive vehicle mileage standards, proposing to increase the average fuel economy starting with model year 2022 vehicles to 52 miles per gallon by 2025, as part of the U.S. Climate Alliance\u2019s Clean Car Promise.\n\n\u201cTo combat climate change, to keep New Mexico\u2019s citizens safe, to protect the air we all breathe, it\u2019s essential we adopt more stringent clean car standards that increase fuel economy and reduce emissions,\u201d she said in her Sept. 24 statement during Climate Week.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s industry helped propel the state budget from $6.3 billion to $7 billion, and the figure could rise to $8 billion in the next fiscal year, according to the Albuquerque Journal, despite the slowdown this year in the U.S. shale production.\n\n\u201cThe mileage thing is not a direct shot at the Permian producers, because you\u2019re obviously talking about the demand side versus the production side, but it is a direct shot in that oil-and-gas workers aren\u2019t driving Priuses,\u201d Mr. Gessing said. \u201cThey\u2019re driving pick-up trucks that don\u2019t get 52 mpg, rest assured.\u201d\n\nThe July 17-18 Pocantico meeting, which included state officials from a dozen Democratic \u201ctrifecta\u201d states, was also sponsored by Rockefeller grantees such as the Georgetown Climate Center, the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University and the Rocky Mountain Institute.\n\nThe move from coal to natural gas in power-plant generation has been credited with reducing U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions, which fell by 12.4% between 2005-17, but gas was in the crosshairs at the Rockefeller gathering.\n\n\u201cWe are well past the point of using natural gas as a transition fuel, and new policies and programs should explicitly avoid further \u2018lock-in\u2019 investments like natural gas fueled municipal buses or energy efficiency funding for natural gas equipment,\u201d said the memorandum.\n\nIn a May 23 email, a staffer with the New Mexico Energy Conservation and Management Division asked the U.S. Climate Alliance about receiving a \u201csub-grant\u201d to bring on a \u201cClimate Fellow,\u201d which would \u201cprovide much needed assistance to our clean energy and climate efforts in New Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe concept of bringing on staff funded by climate advocacy groups is similar to the climate \u201cspecial assistant attorneys general\u201d paid by the Bloomberg-funded State Impact Center at New York University, but USCA\u2019s Julie Cerqueira said no such fellows have been assigned, although two states have requested them.\n\n\u201cSome states have indicated that capacity constraints are a challenge to meeting their climate goals, and that additional staff capacity is needed,\u201d said Ms. Cerqueira in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s what you will see in the released emails. As you see from below, we don\u2019t have a program currently stood up (nor did we previously, despite Horner\u2019s \u2018expose\u2019).\u201d\n\nQuestions have been raised about whether such privately funded state staffers are appropriate, or even legal, but the New Mexico email said that state law allowed the department to apply for private funds \u201cto carry out its programs, duties or services.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico was one of six states to go \u201ctrifecta\u201d blue in the 2018 election after Ms. Lujan Grisham succeeded term-limited Republican Gov. Susana Martinez.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
