(REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi)\n\nIslamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was believed to be dead after a US military raid in Syria's Idlib region, US media reported early on Sunday.\n\nBaghdadi may have killed himself with a suicide vest as US special operations forces descended, media said citing multiple government sources.\n\nHe was the target of the secretly planned operation approved by President Donald Trump, officials said.\n\nLong pursued by the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS), Baghdadi has been erroneously reported dead several times in recent years.\n\nOfficials told ABC News that biometric work was underway to firm up the identification of those killed in the raid.\n\nThe White House announced Trump would make a \"major statement\" on Sunday at 13:00, without providing details.\n\nBaghdadi, a native of Iraq around 48 years old, built the violent jihadist movement into a potent force, in 2014 establishing its own \"caliphate\" territory across large swathes of Syria and Iraq.\n\nIt was blamed for the deaths of thousands of civilians, in summary executions and beheadings, and accused of war crimes.\n\nBut Baghdadi has been on the run since a US-led coalition slowly destroyed the group's organisation and ousted it from its claimed territory in a two-year campaign, finally declaring victory over IS in March of this year.\n\nThe United States had posted a $25m reward for information on his whereabouts.\n\nIn rare video and audio messages this year Baghdadi called on IS fighters to regroup and try to free thousands of their comrades captured by the US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces in northeastern Syria.", "description": "Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was believed to be dead after a US military raid in Syria's Idlib region, US media reported early on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2859/9efecb3262e54ef186813eb7bd4f148b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
