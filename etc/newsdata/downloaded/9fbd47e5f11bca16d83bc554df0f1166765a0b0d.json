The National Transportation Safety Board reported last week that Boeing had underestimated the risk of \u2014 and overestimated pilots\u2019 ability to handle problems with \u2014 an automated feature that contributed to the crashes.\n\nAD\n\nNTSB cites competing pilot warnings and flawed safety assumptions on Boeing 737 Max\n\nYears before those crashes, the FAA found a pattern of recurring safety problems with Boeing. U.S. regulators found, for example, that a Boeing subcontractor had falsified certifications on cargo doors; that Boeing mechanics left tools inside plane wings close to the cables that control their movements; and improperly installed wires on 787s, which could increase the risk of shorts or fires, among other issues.\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, it is not clear what caused the cracks, how widespread the problem may be, and whether it is a reflection of any broader safety issues with the company.\n\nThe FAA said it was issuing its order because the agency \u201cdetermined the unsafe condition. . . is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.\u201d\n\nFAA misled Congress on inspector training for Boeing 737 Max, investigators say\n\nAirlines are required to report their findings from the inspections, which \u201cwill enable the manufacturer to obtain better insight into the nature, cause, and extent of the cracking, and eventually to develop final action to address the unsafe condition,\u201d the FAA said.\n\nAD\n\nThe FAA\u2019s order applies to planes that have reached certain thresholds for time in the air. It considers the number of \u201ccycles\u201d an airplane has been through, meaning how many times it has gone through pressurization and depressurization. \u201cCycles typically correspond to the number of flights and are not dependent on the calendar age of an aircraft,\u201d the FAA said.\n\nAD\n\nThe order \u201cwill require operators to inspect aircraft with more than 30,000 cycles within seven days of the issuance of the rule. Aircraft between 22,600 and 29,999 cycles must be inspected within 1,000 cycles,\u201d the FAA said, adding that airlines will then have to follow up with a regimen of periodic inspections.\n\nSouthwest, which flies only 737s, said it began the inspection process Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTo date, Southwest has not had any unusual findings associated with the pickle fork on our\u201d aircraft, the company said in a statement, using another name for the component at issue.\n\nAD\n\nChanges to flawed Boeing 737 Max were kept from pilots, DeFazio says\n\nSouthwest did not answer a question on how many of its planes are covered by the order, but said, \u201cour Technical Operations Team has developed a schedule to perform overnight inspections on each of the identified aircraft and, based upon that schedule, we do not anticipate any disruption to our operation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, American Airlines said it was working closely with the FAA and Boeing on the new inspection requirements, and that \u201cnone of American\u2019s aircraft in the 737 fleet fall into the seven-day requirement.\u201d\n\nAmerican said its oldest Next-Generation 737 was delivered in 1999 and has about 25,000 cycles. With an average of roughly 1,200 cycles to 1,500 cycles a year, the company said, it anticipates it will have to perform about 80 of the inspections over the next eight months. The company said it expects no impact on its operations.\n\nUnited also said none of its 737 NG aircraft are covered by the seven-day deadline, and the company anticipates about 80 planes will be subject to the inspection requirements for planes with between 22,600 and 29,999 cycles. The inspections will not have any impact on the company\u2019s operations, it said, adding: \u201csafety is our top priority at United Airlines.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The problem, unrelated to the 737 Max, \u201ccould adversely affect the structural integrity of the airplane and result in loss of control of the airplane,\u201d FAA says.", "authors": ["Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CHRLbO3_Rj28E5dONSNeiy-rdfM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3D7SSVCW4II6PBALKEQCMMM5U4.jpg"}
