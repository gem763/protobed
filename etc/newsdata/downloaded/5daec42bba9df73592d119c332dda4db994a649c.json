(AP) - Ricardo Allen says the Atlanta Falcons can\u2019t afford to assume talent will make up for the team\u2019s 1-2 start.\n\nInstead, the safety says the Falcons must make changes now if they want to expect different results.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how much talent you have,\u201d Allen said Monday. \u201cIf you\u2019re not finding a way to win with it, you\u2019ve got to shake something up. Something has to be different.\u201d\n\nAllen didn\u2019t have a quick answer on what changes are needed.\n\nThe bigger mystery is how the Falcons can fix their startling three-game trend for penalties that extend opponents\u2019 drives and stop their own.\n\nSunday\u2019s 27-24 loss at Indianapolis increased the pressure on coach Dan Quinn to eliminate mistakes.\n\nThe Falcons committed 16 penalties for 128 yards against the Colts and fell behind 20-3 at halftime. They have 35 penalties through three games.\n\nUntil the Falcons play a clean game, Allen says the record must be believed.\n\n\u201cYou have to take it for what it is, you\u2019re a 1-2 team,\u201d Allen said. \u201cYou\u2019re not an overly talented team. You\u2019re a 1-2 team. You\u2019ve got to be realistic with it. You\u2019ve got to get better. You\u2019ve got to get back to the drawing board.\u201d\n\nAllen said he remains loyal to Quinn, who is in his fifth season.\n\n\u201cUntil the clock hits 0:00, I\u2019m going to fight with him until there ain\u2019t no tomorrow,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can do.\u201d\n\nQuinn said Monday he\u2019ll have a full crew of officials calling penalties at practice this week. The Falcons normally have a partial crew at practice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to address it right now and we\u2019re not waiting,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nAsked if he\u2019ll have punishment for penalties, such as running laps, Quinn said he\u2019ll instead have guilty players stand beside him on the sideline. He said that punishment is \u201cmore punitive to me.\u201d\n\nIf the heat on the coach continues to intensify, standing next to Quinn could become increasingly uncomfortable for players.\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe offense recovered from a slow start to enjoy its best balance of the season and strong production from Matt Ryan . Devonta Freeman ran for a season-best 88 yards, including a 28-yarder. His 18 carries show he can handle a big workload. Backups Ito Smith and Kenjon Barner left the game with concussions, so the team\u2019s confidence in Freeman is especially important.\n\nRyan threw two scoring passes to tight end Austin Hooper and completed eight passes for 128 yards and an impressive 10-yard touchdown to Julio Jones. The three second-half scores only made the first-half struggles more frustrating.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe defense managed only one sack and couldn\u2019t stop the Colts, who had 29 first downs.\n\nThe inability to produce big plays on defense and the wave of penalties combined for another awful start. After trailing 21-0 at halftime of their opening game at Minnesota, the Falcons trailed the Colts 20-3 at the break. That\u2019s a combined 41-3 halftime deficit in two road games, prompting Quinn to make a postgame demand for his players to find their road mentality.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nHooper, who made his first Pro Bowl last season, continues to emerge as one of Ryan\u2019s top targets. The tight end had his first two-touchdown game, and his six catches marked his third straight game with at least four. Hooper, Calvin Ridley and Mohamed Sanu should continue to benefit from extra defensive attention devoted to Jones.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nOf the team\u2019s 16 penalties, 10 were called on the defense. Quinn says pre-snap penalties are most damaging, and defensive tackle Jack Crawford had two neutral zone infractions in the first half.\n\nINJURED\n\nLosing the game was tough. Perhaps more painful was the loss of safety Keanu Neal, a leader of the defense, to a torn left Achilles tendon. The injury ends his season after he missed most of 2018 with a knee injury. Kemal Ishmael is expected to replace Neal at strong safety.\n\nBrian Hill could be next in line to serve as Freeman\u2019s backup if Smith and Barner can\u2019t return from concussions. Rookie Qadree Ollison also could have a bigger role.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n51 - Jones had his 51st game with at least 100 yards receiving. Only three receivers have more: Jerry Rice (76), Randy Moss (64) and Marvin Harrison (59).\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Falcons (1-2) return home to face Tennessee on Sunday. They then face two straight road games at Houston and Arizona, making this week\u2019s home game especially important.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ricardo Allen says the Atlanta Falcons can't afford to assume talent will make up for the team's 1-2 start.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Charles Odum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/falcons_colts_football_84527_c0-182-4346-2715_s1770x1032.jpg?4af093737a97ec769718e6b59a4818b89afc62a1", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
