The Nationals, after all, beat the Milwaukee Brewers with that strategy.\n\n\u201cTo me, these are all one-game, one-game playoffs,\u201d manager Dave Martinez said before the series started. \u201cThey all are. It\u2019s important if we\u2019re winning to win. To get ahead, stay ahead. So we\u2019re going to use all options necessary to win a game.\u201d\n\nIt got the Nationals this far.\n\nStrasburg\u2019s three-inning shutout relief appearance in the Nationals wild card victory over the Brewers and Scherzer\u2019s breathtaking inning of relief in Game 2, of this division series, striking out the side in Washington\u2019s 4-2 win over Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cBefore the series started, before we even got to the playoffs, our game plan was to try to utilize these guys the best way possible without disrupting their starts,\u201d Martinez told reporters after Game 2. \u201cAnd we talked to all of them and they have all been on board. So it\u2019s just part of it. When you get to these games, I\u2019ve said this before, you\u2019re playing to win one game. Every day\u2019s crucial.\u201d\n\nBut there was never any guarantee that any of these starters would be able to change from one role to another without fail. Coming out of the bullpen is a different mentality, a different role, if you are Corbin and 187 of your 205 major league appearances have been to start the game.\n\nAnibal Sanchez did his job for Washington as Sunday night\u2019s starter, going five innings, allowing four hits, one run, and striking out nine, holding on to a 2-1 lead that the Nationals took early with a two-run home run by Juan Soto in the first inning off Dodgers starter Hyun-Jin Ryu.\n\nBut Ryu settled down and held the Nationals at 2-1 through five. One inning later Patrick Corbin made his appearance and was initiated as a full-fledged member of the Washington hide-your-eyes bullpen.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
