USA TODAY\n\nHOUSTON \u2013 So many moving parts have hovered over this Houston Rockets franchise, and it does not just include Darryl Morey\u2019s tweets about the Hong Kong protests, Russell Westbrook\u2019s arrival and James Harden\u2019s initial shooting struggles.\n\nIt also includes coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who will patrol the sidelines without any assurances on where he will coach after this season.\n\n\"It\u2019s not going to change the way I coach or how I feel trying to compete,\" D\u2019Antoni told USA TODAY Sports. \"So then we\u2019ll see next summer with what happens.\"\n\nD\u2019Antoni had talks last offseason with Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta about a possible extension after guiding Houston to a combined 173-73 record and three playoff appearances in the past three seasons. D\u2019Antoni had no interest in accepting the Rockets\u2019 offer to extend his current contract for just another year.\n\nPerhaps the Rockets become more amenable toward offering D\u2019Antoni more security next summer after seeing whether they can finally advance out of the Western Conference finals, let alone win an NBA title. Then again, D\u2019Antoni might field interest from other teams after seeing how he helped the Rockets become the lone Western Conference team in the last two years to seriously threaten the Golden State Warriors in the playoffs.\n\nROUGH START: Warriors fall to 0-2 after blowout loss against Thunder\n\nEither way, D\u2019Antoni does not consider it fair to have those developments hover over his players. So when both sides could not agree to terms this summer, D\u2019Antoni entered this season willing to have lame-duck status. Usually, coaches balk at that idea, considering it could weaken their authority within the front office and locker room. D\u2019Antoni insisted he does not think that way, however, for a simple reason.\n\n\"I got a great group of guys that I don\u2019t think care. They won\u2019t be affected by it,\" D\u2019Antoni said. \"I won\u2019t be affected by it. So it\u2019s a non-issue.\"\n\nInstead, D\u2019Antoni has other issues on his mind with the Rockets (1-1) hosting the Oklahoma City Thunder (1-2) on Monday in what will mark a reunion both for Westbrook and Chris Paul.\n\nHow will the Harden-Westbrook pairing work? What did D\u2019Antoni take away from the Harden-Paul backcourt before the Rockets traded Paul last summer to Oklahoma City? Can the Rockets thrive on defense just as they have on offense?\n\nGiven all of those developments, how will the Rockets distinguish themselves in a crowded Western Conference that includes two Los Angeles teams with superstar duos (Clippers, Lakers) and a handful of teams banking on continuity (Utah, Denver, San Antonio, Utah)? Can any of those teams, including the Rockets, take advantage of the Golden State Warriors losing Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and possibly Klay Thompson?\n\nPELICANS: Ingram puts burden on himself to carry team without Zion\n\nCLIPPERS: Williams will help Leonard and George form Big 3 for L.A.\n\n\"We have as much talent as anybody in the league. So can we keep building championship habits and do the right thing every time?\" D\u2019Antoni said. \"We don\u2019t fear anybody. But we respect everybody. There are seven teams, probably eight, in the West that are in the mix, too. We somehow have to get it all together.\"\n\nThe biggest factor points to how Harden and Westbrook will work together.\n\nD\u2019Antoni will be the first to downplay the partnership Harden and Westbrook had in Oklahoma City (2009-12). Westbrook mostly started, while Harden mostly came off the bench well before either player fully blossomed. Since their partnership ended seven years ago, Harden and Westbrook each have collected a regular-season MVP award and two scoring titles. Westbrook just surpassed Magic Johnson for second place on the NBA\u2019s all-time triple-doubles list (139). Still, D\u2019Antoni believes Harden and Westbrook can best determine their dynamic because of their on-court credentials and friendship.\n\n\"They can figure that out. They know who\u2019s hot and who has the better matchup,\" D\u2019Antoni said. \"I rely on them to be able to figure that out. That\u2019s something you learn all year. To say that I know now and it won\u2019t be any different in May or April, that won\u2019t be even close. We\u2019ll go through ups and downs. But we\u2019ll figure it out as we go.\"\n\nD\u2019Antoni sounds willing to hand the keys to Harden and Westbrook. Amid coaching stops with the Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers, D\u2019Antoni has considered it important to make his players feel empowered. Hence, D\u2019Antoni has made little of Harden starting the season shooting 23.8% in the first two games. As D'Antoni joked to reporters, \"he's awful. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s had enough games for us to trust him.\"\n\nStill, D\u2019Antoni plans to help steer the wheel.\n\nHe envisioned nearly equal minutes among Harden (36 per night), Westbrook (32) and their teammates (34). While Harden has averaged those minutes in the past three seasons, Westbrook could have his lightest workload since his rookie season 11 years ago. D\u2019Antoni plans to stagger playing time for both players, while ensuring they play together during crunch time. Eric Gordon, a former Sixth Man of the Year, will likely shave minutes for both Harden and Westbrook as well.\n\nAfter the Rockets finished 27th last season in pace (the number of possessions per game), D\u2019Antoni wants that number to increase because of Westbrook\u2019s speed and athleticism. How about Westbrook\u2019s shooting though? He averaged only 29% from 3-point range last season and attempted 4.2 mid-range shots per game, two traits that do not bode well in D\u2019Antoni\u2019s offense. Yet, D\u2019Antoni sounded confident the Rockets can lead the NBA in 3-point attempts for a fourth consecutive season even when accounting for Westbrook\u2019s presence.\n\nIF NOT ZION: Five who could steal Rookie of the Year with Williamson out\n\nWHO WE'RE WATCHING: 25 most interesting players for 2019-20 season\n\n\"We\u2019re going to let him be Westbrook. That\u2019s our guideline,\" D\u2019Antoni said. \"It\u2019s not up to us to change his game. He\u2019s played well. We just want him at that level. We take four or five mid-range shots a game. And he takes four or five. So he\u2019ll be the only that will take them.\"\n\nWestbrook already called dibs on those shots during a recent film session. In a tone that sounded equally joking and serious, D\u2019Antoni said \"we\u2019ll stick to that.\" If that becomes the only source of contention that Westbrook feels? Well, perhaps that pales to what Harden and Paul experienced.\n\nNonetheless, D\u2019Antoni downplayed reports that said Harden and Paul expressed to the front office they no longer wanted to play with each other after not being on speaking terms. The Rockets have maintained those are not the reasons they traded Paul, a pair of first-round picks (2024, 2026) and pick swaps (2021, 2025) to Oklahoma City for Westbrook. Considering the Rockets went 89-27 during Paul\u2019s time here, D\u2019Antoni considered the partnership to be \"fantastic.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s tension every day. There\u2019s tension between all of us,\" D\u2019Antoni said. \"You can either write it and say there was, and I can\u2019t say it was wrong. But you can say it didn\u2019t really affect us. It didn\u2019t affect us. We didn\u2019t play quite enough.\"\n\nInstead, D\u2019Antoni argued that Paul\u2019s right hamstring injury in the 2018 Western Conference finals, as well as numerous injuries last season, played a larger role. D\u2019Antoni stressed that does not mean the Rockets would have beaten the Warriors in either of the past two playoffs. Yet, D\u2019Antoni believes those elements played larger factors than when the Rockets missed 27 consecutive 3s in a decisive Game 7 against the Warriors in 2018.\n\n\"We think we\u2019re playing the right way. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do it,\" D\u2019Antoni said. \"We just have to do a better job at it. Most of it comes down to defense anyway. It doesn\u2019t come down to offense. We seem to score a lot, no matter how we play. But defensively, we have to get better.\"\n\nAfter refusing to retain Trevor Ariza and Luc MBah a Moute in the 2018 offseason partly for financial reasons, the Rockets slightly dropped from sixth in points allowed (103.9) in 2017-18 to tenth (109.1) last season. This year, the Rockets have a dependable rim protector in Tyson Chandler, as well as well as wing defenders P.J. Tucker and Thabo Sefolosha. D\u2019Antoni has also said that Rockets center Clint Capela \"needs to get better.\" And D\u2019Antoni expects Westbrook\u2019s presence on the perimeter and the boards will help as well.\n\nThat gave D\u2019Antoni perspective on how to handle his latest coaching gig.\n\nHe had fared through much worse amid the Knicks\u2019 front office dysfunction, roster turnover and philosophical clashes with Carmelo Anthony before re-signing. He experienced varying degrees of frustration with the Lakers over overlapping injuries to Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, frequent roster turnover and mixed support for his system that most NBA teams currently embrace before re-signing there as well. And this season? D\u2019Antoni believes he has a strong chance to win his first NBA championship despite his uncertain future.\n\n\"Every situation is different. If I had guys looking for outs or not listening to me or if we had problems, it could be a problem,\" D\u2019Antoni said. \"But if you have a great group, which I have luckily, and they want to only win? We have a great relationship and we\u2019re doing this all together.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "Mike D'Antoni is not under contract beyond this season, but he won't let that affect him.
