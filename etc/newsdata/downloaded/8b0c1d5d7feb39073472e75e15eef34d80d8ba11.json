Here\u2019s a possible reason why\u2026\n\nConstant moans and groans from your children sitting in the backseat can be highly distracting for any parent of driver.\n\nAnd while children may be renowned for stirring up a fuss over nothing \u2013 if your child constantly complains that their car seat is hurting them or making them uncomfortable, it may be best to listen.\n\nNational Sales Manager for Maxi-Cosi in South Africa, Mohammed Kaka said that even before the decision is made to purchase a car seat, it\u2019s highly important for parents to touch and experience the seat.\n\nThis, he said, is to ensure that parents can be certain their children are kept safe at all times while driving in the vehicle, and can enjoy maximum comfort. For any child, a car seat above all else, remains the key product for safety.\n\nMost parents often tend to look at prams first, and then make the car seat purchase decision based on if the car seat can fit into the pram.\n\nBut truth be told, your child\u2019s car seat should be your first purchase. Added to that, most parents are under the impression that any seat will do. However, it\u2019s highly important for parents to undertake extensive research to keep their children safe, Mohammed said.\n\nHere are some reasons why your child could be extra cranky while travelling:\n\n1. The car seat may have one or two sharp points pressing against your child. Do a thorough check around all the surface areas of the seat to ensure nothing is hurting your child.\n\n2. No padding over the edge of the seat where the child\u2019s legs are meant to rest, remain one of the more frequent complaints. Ensure that the seat you choose has sufficient padding in this section. Maxi-Cosi is set to launch its customer care centre in Randburg, Johannesburg in September.\n\nMohammed said the aim of the centre is to allow parents to interact with and test the wide range of Maxi-Cosi car seats before making the decision to purchase. This he said, it\u2019s the brand\u2019s way of offering increased value to customers who require maximum safety and comfort for their children.\n\n\u201cA busy parents, means a busy lifestyle, Maxi-Cosi opts to ensure that designs are not only extremelysafe but are easy to use to ensure that safety is never jeopardised when using the car seat.\n\n\u201cA child that is strapped up correctly, ensures that the driver is not distracted in the event of anemergency,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nCompiled for Parent24 by Maxi-Cosi South Africa.\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
