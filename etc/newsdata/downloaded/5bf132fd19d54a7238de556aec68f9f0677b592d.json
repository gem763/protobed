Switchboard operators were done in by the dawn of direct dialling. And in the car industry, auto workers are deathly afraid the engine assembler will give way to battery builders.\n\nDread over the prospect that plug-in cars \u2014 which have fewer parts and require less labour to build \u2014 will doom auto jobs helped spark the first United Auto Workers strike against General Motors Co. in over a decade. Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, which are rolling their own battery-powered models to market in the coming years, could face a similar fate if they\u2019re unable to quell the UAW\u2019s concerns that widespread adoption of EVs endangers the employment of 35,000 union members.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a potential for our jobs to be gone \u2014 they don\u2019t need us anymore,\u201d said Tim Walbolt, president of the UAW local representing workers at a Fiat Chrysler transmission components plant near Toledo, Ohio. \u201cIt scares us.\u201d\n\nFor all the buzz generated by Tesla Inc., the EV era is still in its infancy, with zero-emission autos having reached just 2 per cent of global production. GM has extended the UAW an offer to get in on the ground floor, pitching a new battery plant staffed by dues-paying union members in an Ohio town jarred by job loss. But the overture came with a catch: GM wants to pay the workers less, and the facility is unlikely to need as many staff as an engine or transmission factory would.\n\nA recent study of electric-vehicle production in Europe by consultant AlixPartners found that it took 40 per cent fewer hours to assemble an electric motor and battery than a traditional internal-combustion engine and transmission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad news story from a labour perspective,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, the head of AlixPartners\u2019s automotive practice. \u201cYou would just fundamentally need less people.\u201d\n\nPerversely, GM also arguably has uncertainty on it\u2019s side at the bargaining table. It\u2019s going to want concessions to cushion itself against the risk that consumer adoption of electric autos remains slow. The carmaker isn\u2019t fully utilizing the factory that builds the Chevrolet Bolt EV north of Detroit, and tepid demand for the plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt put the future of the factory that assembles it in nearby Hamtramck in doubt.\n\nCollision Course\n\nThe collision with carmakers over electrification is one the UAW saw coming.\n\n\u201cElectric, to me, is where the real risk is to our membership,\u201d Jennifer Kelly, the union\u2019s research director, said during a collective-bargaining conference in Detroit earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s almost certain to carry over from the UAW\u2019s talks with GM to negotiations with Detroit\u2019s other automakers. Ford has estimated electric cars will require 30 per cent fewer hours of labor per vehicle and 50 per cent less factory floor space.\n\n\u201cRationalization of the powertrain portfolio is certainly a huge opportunity for all of us as we start this transition,\u201d Joe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s automotive president, told investors on an earnings call in April.\n\nElectric, to me, is where the real risk is to our membership Jennifer Kelly, UAW's research director\n\nEven Fiat Chrysler, a laggard with regard to electrification, has stoked fear at union halls linked to internal-combustion components plants, where rumours are flying that the company plans to outsource work to lower-paying suppliers.\n\n\u201cWe cannot help but feel like the left behind stepchildren of the UAW,\u201d Mike Booth, the president of the union\u2019s local in Marysville, Michigan, wrote in a letter to the labour group\u2019s Chrysler council last month. He and other UAW leaders fear that German mega-supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG, which took over operation of a Chrysler axle plant in 2008, will take work away from the automaker\u2019s machining facility near Toledo and a transmission and castings complex in Kokomo, Indiana.\n\nA Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman said the operations the union are concerned about are critical to the business. ZF will continue to work with the UAW in Marysville, and an arrangement in which Fiat Chrysler licenses technology from the supplier in Kokomo may be creating some confusion, a spokesman said. He declined to comment on Toledo.\n\n\u2018Shrinking Bubble\u2019\n\nIn August, GM shut down a transmission plant outside Detroit, affecting more than 260 workers as part of a larger restructuring. That may foreshadow other closures as EV production ramps up. The supply chain is where the job risk is greatest, especially for workers employed making engines, transmissions and sub-components that aren\u2019t needed in EVs.\n\nConsultant IHS Markit predicts the introduction of new gas-powered engine families will drop to zero in 2022, from nearly 70 in 2011, as automakers shift spending to electric propulsion. The market for a whole range of parts used in internal combustion vehicles \u2014 such as axles, mufflers, fuel tanks and transmissions \u2014 will shrink in a range from 6 per cent to 20 per cent by 2025, according to a study by Deloitte Consulting.\n\n\u201cThe value chain is shifting and companies and their unions are going to have to figure out how to change themselves or risk becoming part of a shrinking bubble,\u201d said Neal Ganguli, head of the auto supply base group at Deloitte\u2019s U.S. automotive practice.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem because engines and transmissions currently account for just under half of automaker manufacturing capacity, Credit Suisse auto analyst Dan Levy estimated in a Sept. 23 note to investors. As a result, automakers may face labour, social and political challenges as they transition to EVs, he wrote.\n\n\u2018Rough Time\u2019\n\nGM\u2019s EV factory in Lake Orion, Michigan, offers a window into what the UAW is worried about.\n\nWhile the plant is unionized, the automaker staffs it in part with lower-wage employees under a special contract. What\u2019s more, 64 per cent of the fully electric Bolt model\u2019s content is made in Korea, including the battery.\n\nOne of the biggest suppliers is Seoul-based LG Chem Ltd., which makes cells in South Korea and assembles packs for GM and Fiat Chrysler at a non-union plant in western Michigan with a starting wage for technicians of US$16 an hour.\n\nThe UAW is going to have to try to organize the battery plants, but I think they'll have a rough time Joshua Murray, labour expert\n\nThat\u2019s close to what Ford pays its entry-level temporary workers, but far below the US$28 to US$30 an hour for legacy UAW employees. Temp workers at Ford\u2019s engine and transmission plants also can move up into legacy wage brackets, which isn\u2019t the case at LG\u2019s facility.\n\n\u201cThe move to electric could weaken the union further,\u201d Joshua Murray, a labour expert and assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University. \u201cCertainly, the UAW is going to have to try to organize the battery plants, but I think they\u2019ll have a rough time.\u201d\n\nImported Batteries\n\nNo major automaker entirely outsources engines, in no small part thanks to displacement and horsepower being the source of marketing buzz and bragging rights for decades. EVs are a different story \u2014 even Tesla relies heavily on Japan\u2019s Panasonic Corp. in the making of its battery packs.\n\nBatteries \u2014 the single most expensive part of an electric vehicle \u2014 are almost exclusively manufactured overseas and mostly by companies relatively new to the automotive powertrain, such as China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and South Korea\u2019s SK Innovation Co.\n\nSK Innovation broke ground earlier this year on a new battery factory outside of Atlanta, which will employ some 2,000 non-union workers. And CEO Jun Kim thinks carmakers will have a tough time replicating what his company does.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between the DNA of automakers and battery makers such as us,\u201d Kim said in a March interview. \u201cThere are only a handful of battery suppliers that are capable of delivering high-quality products while guaranteeing cost competitiveness.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Dread over prospect plug-in cars \u2014 which have fewer parts and require less labour to build \u2014 will doom auto jobs helped spark GM strike", "authors": ["Chester Dawson", "Keith Naughton", "Gabrielle Coppola", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gmstrike.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
