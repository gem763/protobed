We hope that we don\u2019t have to use them, but we can shut down the Turkish economy if we need to,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters.\n\nThe announcement came a short time after the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperAmid questions of legality on delaying Ukraine aid, White House shifted authority: report Congress set for showdown with Trump over Kurds Newsom mocks photo of Defense officials with Trump: 'The diversity is truly overwhelming' MORE urged his counterpart in Ankara to halt this week\u2019s offensive into northern Syria following the removal of U.S. troops.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement appeared to be an effort from the White House to appease Republicans who have hammered the administration over its handling of the situation in Syria and called for a tough response to Turkey\u2019s military movements.\n\nTrump has been steadfast in his commitment to pulling U.S. forces out of the region. He has further inflamed criticism by downplaying concerns that his shift in strategy could lead to a resurgence of ISIS or a slaughter of Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump said in recent days that he would \"obliterate\" the Turkish economy if Ankara crossed a line, but he had not laid out any specific examples of what he would consider inappropriate.

The move was announced abruptly late Sunday and drew swift rebukes from lawmakers.\n\nBy Wednesday, Turkish forces had launched an operation into the area, raising alarms among U.S. officials about the fate of the Kurds.\n\nThe U.S. military relied on the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is led by the Kurds, as the local ground force fighting ISIS. But Ankara considers the Syrian Kurds terrorists who are an extension of a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.\n\nTrump has defended his decision amid the backlash, downplaying the U.S. alliance with the Kurds by asserting that they were only assisting in the fight against ISIS to protect their own territory.\n\n\"The Kurds are fighting for their land,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"And as somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, they didn\u2019t help us in the second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example.
