James Lankford of Oklahoma called the discussion of Biden\u2019s son \u201cnot wise.\u201d\n\nBut many Senate Republicans dismissed the notion that there was anything wrong with an American president asking a foreign government to look into investigating the family of his American political rival.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see an issue with it at all,\u201d South Carolina senator Tim Scott said of Trump\u2019s discussing the Biden investigation with the Ukrainain president. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there,\u201d said Florida senator Rick Scott.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything there,\u201d Iowa Republican Joni Ernst told reporters on Wednesday. After the release on Thursday of the whistleblower report related to President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, not much had changed for Ernst. Like several GOP senators, Ernst said she hadn\u2019t had a chance to read the nine-page report: \u201cIf you do want to talk about ethanol, I am happy to talk about ethanol because that\u2019s where all my efforts are right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you read the transcript of the call, it\u2019s turning into a real nothingburger,\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson said. \u201cWe certainly saw no quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Lutheran catechism tells me, \u2018Put the best construction on things.\u2019 What\u2019s happening here in the House, in the press, is the worst possible construction,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nWhen Johnson was asked if he thought Trump would have asked for the Ukrainian president to look into prosecuting Hunter Biden if he weren\u2019t the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s son, he dismissed the question as \u201chypothetical speculation.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham came out swinging in defense of the president. \u201cFrom my point of view, to impeach any president over a phone call like this would be insane,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cWhat would\u2019ve been wrong is if the president had suggested to the Ukrainian government that if you don\u2019t do what I want you to do regarding the Bidens, we\u2019re not going to give you the aid. That was the accusation; that did not remotely happen.\u201d\n\nThe threat wasn\u2019t even implicit? \u201cTo me, that\u2019s not even remotely in the realm of one thing for another.\u201d Graham also told reporters he does not want Congress to investigate Hunter Biden but would like to hear from the whistleblower: \u201cI want to hear why you think what you think. I am not afraid of anyone coming forward and telling this story.\u201d\n\nDemocrats were largely supportive of their colleagues in the House impeaching the president. Virginia Democratic senator Tim Kaine told reporters that Trump had left the House \u201cno choice\u201d but impeachment, calling the discussion of military aid and investigating Biden\u2019s son as \u201cclear a quid pro quo as you would ever find.\u201d\n\nWhen the Ukrainian president asked to buy Javelin missiles, Kaine said, \u201cThis president should say, \u2018Great, that would be American jobs,\u2019\u201d rather than asking for a \u201cfavor\u201d and later \u201cswitching the topic to the investigation\u201d of Biden\u2019s son.", "description": "Following the release of the written record of a July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky -- in which Trump asked Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d the prosecution of Joe Biden\u2019s son in the context of a call dealing with Ukraine\u2019s military needs -- House Democrats pushed", "authors": ["John Mccormack"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6HUP7OQq._tvgZdWwr0Pnw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/67a3a4b5965da6e004d295114d893e9d", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
