About 30% of owners surveyed said they were negatively affected by tariffs.\n\nSlightly fewer business owners surveyed in September expected sales to rise in the months ahead, compared with the prior month's survey. Meanwhile, 25% of owners expected credit conditions to remain the same or tighten despite the rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the NFIB said.\n\nSmall firms still reported higher labor costs, though fewer firms said they were raising selling prices to keep up. The lack of enough job applicants and jobs still going unfilled indicate there is still optimism about the strength of the economy, the report said.\n\nThe broader NFIB survey, based on responses from 700 business owners, is a monthly snapshot of activity among U.S. small businesses, which account for about half of private-sector jobs. The group's optimism index is based on a survey of small-business owners that asks questions such as whether their sales are rising and if they expect the economy to improve six months from now.\n\nEconomists look to the report as a gauge of domestic demand and to extrapolate hiring and wage trends in the broader economy.\n\nWrite to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 06:14 ET (10:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
