It\u2019s very different.\u201d\n\nMr. Iger believes that, if Mr. Jobs had lived, Disney and Apple might have merged.\n\nBut it worked out quite differently. After Mr. Iger proudly revealed his $6.99-a-month price point for Disney+, telling me that it would be hard for anyone to compete, Apple announced a streaming service for $4.99 a month, underpricing Mr. Iger, who was on the Apple board. Mr. Iger resigned from the board the day of the announcement, acknowledging the conflict of interest.\n\nHe thinks that Mr. Jobs also could have helped steer Silicon Valley in a better direction. \u201cSteve had quite a conscience.\u201d Mr. Iger says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t always manifest itself in his interpersonal relationships, but he had quite a conscience. Silicon Valley needs leaders.\u201d The two men became so close that Mr. Jobs pulled Mr. Iger aside right before the announcement of the $7 billion Disney-Pixar deal to confide that his pancreatic cancer had come back and was now in his liver. Only his wife, Laurene, knew. Mr. Iger had to think fast; he rejected Mr. Jobs\u2019s offer to back out of the deal.\n\nAnd what about the moment when the Happiest Place on Earth thought about annexing the Nastiest Place on Earth ? Mr. Iger writes in the book about how he pulled the plug at the last minute on a deal to buy Twitter, thinking it could help Disney modernize its distribution. But he had a feel in his gut it wasn\u2019t right, and called a stunned Jack Dorsey to tell him.\n\n\u201c The troubles were greater than I wanted to take on , greater than I thought it was responsible for us to take on,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere were Disney brand issues, the whole impact of technology on society. The nastiness is extraordinary. I like looking at my Twitter newsfeed because I want to follow 15, 20 different subjects. Then you turn and look at your notifications and you\u2019re immediately saying, why am I doing this? Why do I endure this pain? Like a lot of these platforms, they have the ability to do a lot of good in our world. They also have an ability to do a lot of bad. I didn\u2019t want to take that on.\u201d", "description": "Hollywood\u2019s nicest C.E.O. satellite-dishes on Katzenberg, Murdoch and why he, too, is disturbed by Twitter.", "authors": ["Maureen Dowd"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/fashion/22WITH-BOBIGER1/22WITH-BOBIGER1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
