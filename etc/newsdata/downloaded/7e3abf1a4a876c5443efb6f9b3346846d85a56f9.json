Whatever level of trade calm there was, just gave way to the fact how tenuous any newfound sense of trade war neutrality is in this environment.\n\nHowever, with the U.S. administration opening economic wars on multiple fronts with China around human rights violations and potential capital flow, this could get much worse than current price action suggest. Indeed, regardless of what comes out of these trade talks, it could be little more than a case out of the frying pan and quickly into the fire again.\n\nA Mini deal is still possible\n\nA mini deal with China would be favourable, but whether it is merely a detente (no new tariffs) or something slightly more substantial (rolling back some tariffs) that\u2019s the big question for how intense the risk revival extends. But regardless, investors would revel at any sliver of optimism for no other reason than gnawing uncertainty would abate.\n\nTrading the risk\n\nI wrote this before the SCMP news broke, but I thought better to include as we might get another headline shift, or who knows maybe even a trade deal before the days out.\n\nAn obvious point of reaction will be how the market reprices both the Fed and the ten-year U.S. Treasury yields on a positive trade talk outcome. With much of the data unlikely to shift immediately, the expectation for easing through December 2019 may not change dramatically or instantly. But a trade war detente + rolling back of tariffs could see some significant repricing of the 2020 Fed curve.\n\nAccording to the latest commitment of trader data, the pain trade is for a better deal than the market expects given that the street has adopted a defensive once bitten twice shy strategy ahead of the trade talks.\n\nThe commitment of Traders CFTC\n\nThe S&P index options are running bearishly at nearly 2.5 puts to call ratio, and Gold-backed ETF and Comex positions are running at or near record levels suggesting there\u2019s a massive tail risk is if a deal gets hashed out. Defensive strategies look thick, so if these positions are triggered to unwind, it could exponentially amplify the risk revival on a positive trade talk outcome.\n\nOil markets\n\nOil prices struggled overnight as the Syria headline risk was no match for the EIA reporting a bearish build in crude oil inventories of 2.9 million barrels for the week to October 4 which of course was getting compounded by the EIA short term outlook report which is still too fresh in traders mind after it revised down its average price of WTI for 2020\n\nAnd with oil traders wearing demand emotions on their sleeve, the high level of trade talk circumspect that is permeating every pocket of the capital market in the wake of the SCMP report offers little joy for oil bulls as oil prices are basically left weighed down by yet another trade war anvil around the market neck.\n\nTraders likely have their finger to the wind trying to gauge the intensity of the latest headwinds but at minimum prices could be capped until the markets get some type of favourable headline tailwind at least.", "description": "Global stock market indices plummeted on a report by South China Morning Post SCMP suggesting no progress was made at deputy level talks before the US-China trade meeting to kick off today.", "authors": ["Stephen Innes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B1bWl3EpcvEbWADl_owBPw--~B/aD00NjY7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/7a366b76d740e127850dd1e929da7ba6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
