Had he died alone by himself, I\u2019d probably be happy \u2013 but not when he kills three children along with him.\"\n\nAs U.S. forces closed in, al-Baghdadi grabbed three of his children and ran into a tunnel inside his compound, where he was eventually cornered by a U.S. military dog, President Trump said Sunday. The president described al-Baghdadi as, \"whimpering, crying and screaming the whole time.\" He then detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and the children around him.\n\n\"It\u2019s just a terrible scenario,\" Drake said in an interview with ABC News Live \"The Briefing Room.\" \"I take no pleasure knowing he\u2019s dead.\"\n\n(MORE: US special operations forces captured 'two adult males' in al-Baghdadi raid: Pentagon)\n\nDarren Drake was riding a bike along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan when 29-year-old Uzbek national Sayfullo Saipov plowed him down on a rampage perpetrated with a pickup truck rented from Home Depot.\n\nSaipov was later captured and indicted by a federal grand jury. In the complaint, prosecutors say: \"Saipov was motivated to commit the attack after viewing a video in which [ISIL leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ... questioned what Muslims in the United States and elsewhere were doing to respond to the killing of Muslims in Iraq.\"\n\nPHOTO: Carl and Marsha Mueller, parents of Kayla Mueller, appear on Good Morning America, Oct. 28, 2019. (ABC News) More\n\nCarl Mueller, whose daughter Kayla -- a humanitarian aid worker in Syria -- was taken hostage by Baghdadi himself and later presumed killed, says he had hoped the terror leader would have been taken alive.\n\n'We were actually hoping that he would be captured so we could possibly get some intel from him,\" Mueller told ABC News, \"but if a person is willing to kill themselves rather than be captured, I don\u2019t think you would get a lot of information from that person.\" Kayla Mueller's remains have never been recovered, and her father is on a mission for closure.\n\n\"Someone that they've captured in that group that was close to al-Baghdadi knows what happened to her,\" Mueller said of two adult men detained during the U.S. military raid. \"They know how she died, they probably know where she is buried or -- see, we\u2019re not 100% sure Kayla\u2019s even dead. That\u2019s the struggle that we\u2019ve been facing and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to start speaking out about.\"\n\nPHOTO: Steven Sotloff's parents, Shirley and Arthur, talk about their son on August 14, 2015.
