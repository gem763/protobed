It doesn't matter that he was a founder of the Kuomintang,\" the guide said.\n\n\"He would definitely side with the Communists in regards to cross-strait ties with Taiwan,\" he added, repeating a claim advanced by the Communist Party.\n\nTaiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still views the island as its territory awaiting reunification.\n\nSome scholars and overseas Chinese, however, say the cosmopolitan, Christian, republican physician would hardly be a supporter of the Communist Party today.\n\nBut Anson Luo, a 36-year-old businessman from Sun's home province of Guangdong in southern China, dismisses those doubters.\n\n\"If there was no Sun, China would have wandered in the darkness for many years,\" Luo said.", "description": "The eastern city of Nanjing contains vestiges of China's past that represent an inconvenient truth for the government today: the Chinese world has not always revolved around the Communists and Beijing.
