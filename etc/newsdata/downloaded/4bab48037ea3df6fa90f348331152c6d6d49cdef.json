The government\u2019s tally was lower, but it said it was still updating information.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said there was no plan to slow rescue operations that involved around 110,000 police, coast guard, firefighters and military troops.\n\n\u201cRescue work and searches for the missing are continuing around the clock,\u201d Abe told parliament.\n\n\u201cWhere rivers flooded, work is ongoing to fix spots where banks broke, and water is being pumped out where floods occurred.\u201d\n\nHis office said more than 3,000 people were rescued in the wake of the disaster, which affected 36 of the country\u2019s 47 prefectures.\n\nThe defence ministry has called up several hundred reserve troops \u2014 in addition to active duty soldiers \u2014 for the first time since a 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\n\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako were \u201cdeeply grieving for so many people affected\u201d, an Imperial Household Agency official said.\n\nThe royal couple \u201cexpressed their sincere condolences for those who lost their lives\u2026 and heartily hope that those who are unaccounted for will be found as soon as possible,\u201d the official said.\n\nDespite the scale of the disaster, the government has no plan to delay a palace ceremony and parade to celebrate Naruhito\u2019s enthronement on October 22.\n\n\u2013 Thousands without power, water \u2013\n\nHagibis crashed into land with gusts up to 216 kilometres (134 miles) per hour, but it was the storm\u2019s heavy rain that caused the most damage.\n\nDeaths were reported across many prefectures and included a man whose apartment was flooded, a municipal worker whose car was caught in rising waters and at least seven crew aboard a cargo ship that sank in Tokyo bay on Saturday night.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, some 24,000 households were still without power, and 128,000 homes had no water.\n\nTens of thousands of people were in government shelters, with many unsure when they would be able to return home.\n\n\u201cMy frightened daughter can\u2019t stop shaking. We want to go home quickly,\u201d Rie Nishioka, 39, told Kyodo News agency in Miyagi prefecture.\n\nAbe promised action on Tuesday after reports of two homeless men being denied access to a shelter in eastern Tokyo.\n\n\u201cShelters are supposed to be set up for the purpose of protecting lives of affected people,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\n\u2013 Government pledges aid \u2013\n\nThe government pledged financial support to affected regions without specifying how much aid it would set aside.\n\n\u201cSupport for the victims of the disaster is an urgent task,\u201d Abe said.\n\n\u201cThere are concerns that the impact on daily life and economic activities may be long-lasting.\u201d\n\nAnother area affected by the storm was Fukushima, where several bags containing soil and plants collected during nuclear decontamination efforts were washed away.\n\n\u201cTen bags out of 2,667 were swept into a river during the typhoon, but six of them were recovered yesterday,\u201d environment ministry official Keisuke Takagi told AFP, adding that the remaining four bags had been found and would be collected soon.\n\n\u201cResidents must be worried about the environment, but there are no reports that the bags were broken, so there will be nothing to worry about once they have been recovered safely,\u201d he said.\n\nBy Tuesday, transport was largely back to normal, though some flights were cancelled and train services partially disrupted where tracks or train stock were damaged by the storm.\n\nThe typhoon also caused disruption to sporting events, delaying Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and forcing Rugby World Cup organisers to cancel three matches.\n\nA crunch fixture pitting the hosts against Scotland went ahead on Sunday night, with Japan winning its first-ever quarter final spot.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rescuers in Japan worked around the clock Tuesday in an increasingly desperate search for survivors of a powerful weekend typhoon that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/15/0e64be_cleanup-rescue-efforts-continued-in-japan-days-deadly-typhoon-hagibis-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
