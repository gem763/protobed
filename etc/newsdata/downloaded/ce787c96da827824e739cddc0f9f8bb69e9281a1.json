The company again led its earnings with non-standard metrics that are not allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, putting it at risk of an enforcement action. Waterloo, Ont.-based BlackBerry said it had a net loss of $44 million, or 10 cents a share, in the quarter, after income of $43 million, or a loss of 4 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings were breakeven, better than the 1 cent loss consensus from FactSet. Revenue rose to $244 million from $210 million, but was below the $268 million FactSet consensus. BlackBerry's earnings release started with non-GAAP revenue, or revenue that does not conform with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a metric the regulator does not allow, as MarketWatch has reported previously. It said that revenue number came to $261 million. The company also said it has named Steve Rai as its chief financial officer from Oct. 1. promoting him from current role as deputy CFO. Rai will replace Steve Capelli, who is becoming chief revenue officer. Shares have gained 5.6% in 2019, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.46% has gained 19.3%.", "description": "BlackBerry Ltd. shares fell 19% in early trade Tuesday, after the cybersecurity company posted weaker-than-expected revenue numbers for its fiscal second...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
