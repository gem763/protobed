Critics calling for a change in that policy were rebuked on Wednesday, when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the stance in a hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nPresidential candidate Elizabeth Warren thrust Facebook\u2019s political ad policy into the center of the 2020 campaign last week, when she ran an intentionally false ad on the platform and later criticized the company for \u201ctaking money to promote lies.\u201d\n\nIn a newly released interview, taped last Tuesday, a top television writer and producer said the failure of social media companies Facebook and Twitter (TWTR) to moderate false content is having calamitous effects.\n\n\u201cWhat they fail to police is ruining the world,\u201d says David Simon, the producer of shows such as \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cTreme,\u201d and \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d who has been banned from Twitter multiple times for offending content. \u201cThere's no ethical strand that is tethered to truth as a value.\u201d\n\nSimon criticized Facebook and Twitter for moderating inconsequential posts and letting influential ones remain on the site.\n\n\u201cThe simple vulgarities and obscenities, or mere sarcasm, that they'll chase and run down with great vigor mean nothing,\u201d Simon says.\n\n\u201cWhat they choose to police is meaningless, and what they are incapable of policing is because they have no newsroom,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u2018Truth has been devalued\u2019\n\nReluctant to judge veracity on its platform, Facebook partners with fact-checking organizations that vet ads and posts, an arrangement that began after the 2016 presidential election. False posts receive a mark to alert users and get a reduction in distribution. Meanwhile, false advertisements are banned from the platform, with the exception of those purchased by political candidates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has garnered attention for ads posted on Facebook that make false allegations about Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn response to a question about the factors that led to the rise of Trump, Simon says, \u201cI think truth has been devalued in the most incredible way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if Goebbels had had the capacity to sidestep, you know, even the world press on a daily basis? To completely sidestep the world press,\u201d he adds, referring to Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda in Nazi Germany. \u201cHow much further might that message have traveled unimpeded? And we're in that point of untried, untested waters.\u201d\n\nPolitical ads generate less than 5% of the company\u2019s revenue, Reuters reported last year.\n\n\u201cThe very small percent of our business that\u2019s made up of political ads does not come anywhere close to justifying the kind of controversy\u201d caused by the ad policy, Zuckerberg told members of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.\n\nHe then defended the policy on free speech grounds.\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, it's important for people to see for themselves what politicians are saying,\u201d he said.\n\nSimon is best known for creating the HBO show \u201cThe Wire,\u201d which ran for five seasons in the mid-2000s. His other shows include \u201cTreme,\u201d \u201cShow Me a Hero,\u201d and most recently \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d starring James Franco and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Simon won an Emmy in 2000, and has been nominated for four since. He previously worked as a journalist for the Baltimore Sun and is the author of \u201cHomicide: A Year on the Killing Streets,\u201d which chronicles his year with detectives from the homicide unit of Baltimore\u2019s police department.\n\nSimon made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nActor/executive producer James Franco, left, and executive producer David Simon participate in \"The Deuce\" panel during the HBO Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour at the Beverly Hilton on Wednesday, July 26, 2017, in Beverly Hills, Calif.
