Dropping out of such a special appearance is rarely my style.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think that human rights violators and merit-based abusers of displaced people should be given a platform to \u2018reimagine\u2019 history,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe atrocity of family separation at our Southern border needs to go down in history as one of the United States of America\u2019s most merciless acts.\u201d\n\nWith respect and gratitude. pic.twitter.com/rhKpRYf6gF \u2014 Brandi Carlile (@brandicarlile) October 21, 2019\n\nThe Carlile went on to declare her refusal to support Kirstjen \u201chaving a voice among the most powerful and inspiring women in America.\u201d\n\nNielsen resigned as head of Homeland Security in April, after taking the brunt of the criticism for her implementation of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies on illegal immigration.\n\nThe 47-year-old will be interviewed PBS reporter Amna Nawaz for a conversation titled, \u201cThe Hard Questions,\u201d that will involve topics such as the \u201cthe horror of family separation [and] border security.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton was also slated to appear at the event, although she reportedly pulled out after hearing that Nielsen and 2020 presidential candidate Rep.
