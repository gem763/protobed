(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) caught up with hardware rivals on Tuesday by revealing a triple-camera iPhone, and it rolled out a streaming TV service priced at $5 a month, undercutting Disney and Netflix.\n\nThe announcements came at the company\u2019s biggest marketing event, where it unveils its top products for the year ahead, and showcased an aggressive Apple ready to battle on price.\n\nThe long-awaited Apple TV+ streaming television service will be available in over 100 countries, starting in November.\n\nBuyers of an iPhone, iPad or Mac will get a free year of streaming TV, potentially drawing hundreds of millions of viewers to the service. That catapults the new service into a rarified group of companies.\n\n\u201cI think the pricing on the Apple TV service was definitely a positive surprise,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the hammering in some of the other video service-related names like Netflix, Amazon and Roku. Clearly, that was a positive that people were happy to hear.\u201d\n\nThere was no bundle with Apple Music or other services as some analysts had expected. But Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said the TV service, a $5 a month \u201cArcade\u201d gaming service and the base model iPhone 11, seem designed to draw in users for the longer term.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting Apple Arcade and particularly Apple TV to be priced as aggressively as they were,\u201d Bajarin said. \u201cThey know once consumers get into their ecosystem, they don\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\nApple said its new iPhone 11 will come with two back cameras, including an ultra wide-angle lens and the next generation of microchips, the A13. Prices start at $699, down from last year\u2019s new iPhone that started at $749.\n\nThe more expensive iPhone 11 Pro will have three cameras on the back - wide angle, telephoto and ultra-wide. It can create videos with all three back cameras and the front camera at the same time and starts at $999. The iPhone 11 Pro Max with a bigger screen starts at $1,099. The new phones are available to order Friday and will start shipping Sept. 20.\n\nRivals including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) already sell phones with three cameras on the back. While Apple once tested the upper limits of what consumers would pay for a phone, it is now giving ground on prices, even making older models available at significant discounts to the latest technology.\n\nCEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 11 Pro at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\n\u201cConsumers absolutely still care about cameras. That\u2019s why it was surprising over the last couple of years that Samsung and Huawei got the jump on Apple,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cApple was playing a bit of catch up, but Apple did bring their game, particularly on the video side of the camera, where I do think they\u2019ll have the leg up.\u201d\n\nAnalysts expect Apple will sell around 200 million iPhones in the next year, in addition to other devices, and while many of those will be in China, it ensures at least tens of millions of potential viewers for the subscription service.\n\nHal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel, said Apple\u2019s lower priced iPhones \u201caren\u2019t exciting on the surface, but the low streaming price may suck in some new subscribers.\u201d Apple shares gained 0.8%.\n\nCROWDED FIELD\n\nWith streaming content, Apple is entering a crowded field dominated by Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2N6OB2j)\n\nWalt Disney Co (DIS.N) will launch on Nov. 12 a $7-per-month service that will contain that firm\u2019s iconic children\u2019s content. Apple is also trying to win out over HBO Max with its hit shows like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nApple\u2019s challenge is to persuade consumers that its family of devices, from its set-top box to phones, are the best one-stop place to watch shows.\n\n\u201cThe roll out of new subscription-based services by Apple paves the way for the introduction of new business models akin to the all-you-can-eat bundles like Amazon Prime,\u201d said Paolo Pescatore, analyst with PP Foresight. \u201cIn the future we might even see users pay for a service bundle and receive a new iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nApple also unveiled an updated watch, the Series 5, with an always-on display, starting at $399, while keeping the older Series 3 starting at $199. Moorhead said the older model would drive \u201ctremendous\u201d business.\n\nApple said the seventh generation of the iPad will start at $329 and be available to order starting Tuesday and in stores on Sept. 30.", "description": "Apple Inc caught up with hardware rivals on Tuesday by revealing a triple-camera iPhone, and it rolled out a streaming TV service priced at $5 a month, undercutting Disney and Netflix.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428413579&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF891VA", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
