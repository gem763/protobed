But last week, when Rockets GM Morey tweeted his support for the pro-democracy movement in the former British protectorate, the NBA sidled to China\u2019s side and castigated Morey for his support of freedom.\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong burn LeBron jerseys: Protestors gathered on courts amid Hong Kong's high-rise buildings to vent their anger and set fire to LeBron James jerseys after the Lakers star's comments about free speech. https://t.co/VAPIVHyBro pic.twitter.com/OPxbCjURDh \u2014 StubOrder.com \ud83c\udf9f\ud83d\udcba (@StubOrder) October 15, 2019\n\nBy Monday, L.A. Lakers star LeBron James jumped feet first into the controversy by scolding Morey for supporting those seeking freedom and even attacking Morey\u2019s right to free speech.\n\n\u201cYes, we do have freedom of speech,\u201d James said on Monday. \u201cBut at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others when you only think about yourself.\u201d\n\nJames went on to scold Morey for tweeting his support for Hong Kong\u2019s demonstrators despite the harm it may have done to the NBA\u2019s big-money deals with the Chinese.\n\n\u201cSo many people could have been harmed,\u201d James complained, \u201cnot only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\u201d\n\nBut supporters of the pro-democracy demonstrators slammed James.\n\n\u201cJames was trying, you know, to take a side, on the China side, which is, like, ridiculous,\u201d Aaron Lee told ESPN. \u201cHe was being honest financially. Financial is money. Simple as that. LeBron James stands for money. Period.\u201d\n\nWatch Hong-Kong Protestors Burn Lebron James Jerseys In Middle of Streets For Comments James Made Against Rockets Owner Daryl Morey (Pics) https://t.co/Ocd9gQASSA pic.twitter.com/EuWjte8JN0 \u2014 BILL SOURCE (@billsource) October 15, 2019\n\n\u201cPeople are angry,\u201d James Lo added.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Demonstrators in Hong Kong began burning their LeBron James jerseys and merchandise after the NBA star made comments that were critical of", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Mark-Schiefebein-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
