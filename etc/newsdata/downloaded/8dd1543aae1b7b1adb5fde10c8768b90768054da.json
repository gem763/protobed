The Greek salvage company, Poseidon Salvage International, and the Yemeni coast guard couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. The ship\u2019s captain and engineer weren\u2019t identified in court papers.\n\nThe bogus pirate attack included seven masked, armed assailants posing as security contractors who boarded the Brillante Virtuoso near Aden, Yemen, on July 6, 2011, according to court filings.\n\nAccording to the court papers, the men fired shots on the bridge and detonated an explosive device in the fuel purifier room, starting a fire which spread to the engine room with the use of fire accelerants.\n\nThe assailants then left the ship and an officer at the bridge called a nearby U.S. Navy cruiser, the USS Philippine Sea, for help. The crew was evacuated and the Poseidon salvage company was called in to fight the blaze. But the fire became stronger and the ship was declared a total loss.\n\nThe judge said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that the captain would allow armed men aboard and that Poseidon was allegedly responsible for the resurgence of the fire. The engineer was also accused of not following firefighting procedures like shutting down air vents and fuel pipes.\n\nJudge Teare said that some \u201cparts of the canvas remain blank\u201d to directly link Mr. Iliopoulos to the plan to set the tanker on fire.\n\nThe court heard testimony that the ship had an operating loss of around $10 million between 2009 and 2011 and by the time of the incident Mr. Iliopoulos was late in paying crew wages, fuel supplies and insurance.\n\n\u201cMr. Iliopoulos had a motive to want the vessel to be damaged by fire, namely, the making of a fraudulent claim for the total loss of the vessel in the sum of some $77 million which, if successful, would solve the serious financial difficulties in which he and his companies were at the time,\u201d Judge Teare said.\n\nThe underwriting group included Hiscox Dedicated Corporate Member, Talbot Underwriting, QBE Corporate, Chaucer Corporate Capital, GAI Indemnity, Markel Capital, Catlin Syndicate and Novae Corporate Underwriting.\n\nPeople with knowledge of the matter said Piraeus Bank will now try to recover the money for the mortgage from Mr. Iliopoulos\u2019s assets in Greece.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "A Greek shipowner was behind an elaborate fraud plan in 2011 to set fire to his own tanker off the coast of Yemen to collect $77 million in insurance, according to a High Court judge in London.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-114934/social", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
