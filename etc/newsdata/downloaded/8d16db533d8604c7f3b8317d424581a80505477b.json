The stakes could not be higher.\n\nWe fail to protect vulnerable people\n\nWhen we marginalize and disenfranchise people because of who they are or who they love, we deprive them of their life, their liberty and their pursuit of happiness.\n\nToo often in too many states, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people face discrimination or mistreatment without state or federal laws explicitly protecting them. Our failure to protect some of our most vulnerable, people with a long history of facing oppression and misunderstanding, runs counter to our core values as Americans.\n\nRainbow flags near the Stonewall Inn and Stonewall National Monument on May 29 2019 in New York, N.Y. More\n\nThat failure also runs counter to my values as a Christian. As the founder and chief executive presbyter of New Journey Ministries, I am called to speak out and spread the word about issues that are important to me, my congregation and our country.\n\nMy calling to advocate for others, as well as my commitment to inclusion, have been central to the very premise of my ministry for more than 30 years. I believe all people must love others unconditionally. I believe we are to embrace our immense diversity. I believe we are to welcome all humanity.\n\nFreedom of religion, freedom from bias\n\nLet me be clear: We can all agree that freedom of religion is fundamentally important. It has been a cornerstone of our democracy since our nation\u2019s founding. But no one\u2019s faith gives them the right to discriminate.\n\nNo matter how the Supreme Court rules, we have more work to do to ensure we realize America\u2019s promise of liberty and freedom for all Americans. We must always strive to build welcoming and affirming spaces.\n\nThat includes our places of worship \u2014 but it also means our places of work, our local communities and our governments. One critical way that we can make these spaces more welcoming is by establishing express and enduring nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people, here in Florida and nationwide.\n\nRev.
