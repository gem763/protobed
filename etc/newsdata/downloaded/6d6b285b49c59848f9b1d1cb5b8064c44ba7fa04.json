But the White House pushed back on those reports Wednesday night, and the announcement of the meeting with Trump on Friday appears to confirm that Liu will be staying through the week.\n\nStocks moved higher on Thursday after the announcement amid hopes that it could indicate the president might agree to some sort of mini-deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 160 points while the S&P 500 climbed roughly 16 points, or about 0.6 percent.\n\nIt remains unclear, however, what the two sides will be able to accomplish this week and whether they will make enough progress to persuade Trump to hold off on another tariff increase set to take place Oct. 15.\n\nOne person close to the talks told POLITICO a delay of the tariff increase on $250 billion worth of goods from 25 percent to 30 percent is unlikely to happen based on what China has offered so far.\n\nAnother person close to the negotiations also said what the Chinese offered at the beginning of this week was \"clearly\" not enough to roll back a 15 percent tariff the U.S. placed on roughly $110 billion worth of largely consumer goods from China on Sept. 1.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6b/b6/057de9714180aa18e0ef60567afa/190513-donald-trump-liu-he-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
