And move over race card, gender card and all that President Donald Trump hates the immigrants type of messaging. There\u2019s a new scandal that\u2019s seized Washington, D.C.\n\nIt\u2019s called \u2014 Sharpie-gate.\n\nAnd it\u2019s bound to be the tool by which Democrats will finally, at long last, ultimately and with nothing but sighs of relief all around, Take. Down. Donald. Trump.\n\nOr not.\n\nRegardless: Just look at all these headlines. Just take in all this coverage.\n\n\u201cPerfect storm: Media pound Trump over \u2018Sharpie-gate\u2019 hurricane map,\u201d Fox News reported just this Friday.\n\nAnd this, a day earlier, from CNN: \u201cTrump called Fox News correspondent into Oval Office to argue he wasn\u2019t wrong about Alabama.\u201d\n\nAnd this, from the Los Angeles Times: \u201cWhy Trump\u2019s hurricane map overshadowed CNN\u2019s climate town hall.\u201d\n\nAnd this, from The Washington Post: \u201cTrump\u2019s insistence that his incorrect Alabama tweet was correct tips into the Orwellian.\u201d\n\nAnd this, from Popular Science: \u201cWhat the president can teach us about reading hurricane forecasts.\u201d\n\nAnd this, from GovExec.com: \u201cPlay of the Day: The President and Weather Maps.\u201d\n\nAnd this, from the Salt Lake Tribune, an opinion piece from Eugene Robinson: \u201cTrump\u2019s bogus weather map embodies the man.\u201d\n\nAnd this, again from Fox News: \u201cSunny Hostin suggests Trump could be charged with felony for claim about Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path.\u201d\n\nEven Democrat presidential hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg took a time-out from his campaign trail to comment about the \u2014 crisis? \u2014 to say, as CNN\u2019s headline put it: \u201cButtigieg: \u2018I feel sorry for the president\u2019 after he showed apparently altered hurricane map.\u201d\n\nSharpie-gate has turned into the crime of the century, a media whirlwind driven by a \u201cwe got you now, Mr. President\u201d kind of attitude.\n\nTrump, of course, isn\u2019t helping calm coverage with his tweets. But then again, in the end, who gives a rat\u2019s you know what?\n\nHurricane Dorian is steadily plowing up the East Coast. Alabama seems safe \u2014 as Alabama itself tweeted some days ago.\n\n\u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,\u201d NWS Birmingham tweeted. \u201cWe repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nGood news.\n\nBut here\u2019s an interesting message retweeted by Trump just recently. It\u2019s from Alabama\u2019s National Guard, sent out on Aug. 30, and it goes: \u201c#HurricaneDorian is projected to reach southern Alabama by the early part of the week. We are watching closely and #ready to act. Are you?\u201d\n\nSigh.\n\nSharpie-gate. The new Russia? Hmm, guess not.\n\nOh well, perhaps there\u2019s a pencil-gate out there, just waiting in the wings.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
