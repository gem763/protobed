A company-compiled consensus of 24 brokers\u2019 estimates had forecast third-quarter underlying replacement-cost profit at $1.73 billion.\n\nBP attributes the fall partly to weaker oil prices, with Brent crude at $62 a barrel in the quarter, compared with $75 bbl in the year-earlier period. Production was also hit by maintenance activities in some of the company\u2019s highest-margin regions, as well as Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico, which shut down facilities for about 14 days, BP said.\n\nThe company also reported a non-cash, non-operating after-tax charge of $2.6 billion related to divestments.\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter was $62.29 billion, compared with $80.80 billion the previous year, BP said. The company reported a net loss of $749 million.\n\nUpstream production for the quarter, excluding Rosneft Oil Co. (ROSN.MZ), rose 4.4% to 2.57 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Underlying replacement-cost profit before interest and tax in the upstream business--which produces oil and gas--fell to $2.14 billion from $4 billion last year.\n\nLooking ahead, BP said it expects fourth-quarter production to be higher thanks to the completion of seasonal maintenance and turnaround activities.\n\nOperating cash flow, excluding payments related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, was $6.5 billion, while net debt rose to $46.5 billion, BP said. The company paid roughly $400 million in connection to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a $20 billion settlement with the U.S. government in 2015.\n\nBP declared a quarterly dividend at 10.25 cents a share.\n\nThe company said divestment transactions announced in 2019 totaled $7.2 billion at the end of the quarter, adding it expects to reach around $10 billion by the end of the year.", "description": "he London-based energy giant posted a replacement-cost loss--a metric similar to the net income figure that U.S. oil companies report--of $351 million for...", "authors": ["Giulia Petroni"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HD314_bp_ref_ZG_20190205081244.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
