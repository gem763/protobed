The services started out in January as private and only recently have been opened up to the public and all across America.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Kim and Kanye made a surprise appearance at Howard University, in Washington, D.C., for a pop-up service where West gave a 10-minute speech, in which he shared, \"If you believe that Jesus died for your sins, then you know the gospel... It's simple.

We're here to spread the gospel,\" he said to applause, in a video obtained by TMZ.\n\nWest joked his favorite version of the Bible is the King James because it says \"ye\" in it, adding as he read a few Bible verses, \"Excuse me if I mispronounce anything, I'm a recent convert, that means I recently got saved this year.\"\n\nReading aloud he said, \"It is God's grace that you have been saved, through faith. It is not the result of your own efforts, but God's gift...The Lord is great and deserves our greatest praise...\"\n\nHe added: \"Imagine someone sending their only son -- they don't have 10 sons -- their only son, to die for you!\"\n\nHAILEY BALDWIN CALLED 'FAKE CHRISTIAN' FOR CELEBRATING HALLOWEEN --HERE'S HOW SHE RESPONDED\n\nWest revealed that his favorite verse right now is Mark 1:15, \"The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel. It's the first thing Jesus said... the first thing J.C. said.\"\n\nIn a song reportedly called \"Closed on Sunday,\" he can be heard singing, \"You my Chick-fil-A... follow Jesus.\"\n\n\"Jesus Is King\" is coming out alongside a film, which is set to hit IMAX theaters Oct. 25.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe film \"brings Kanye West\u2019s famed Sunday Service to life in the Roden Crater, visionary artist James Turrell\u2019s never-before-seen installation in Arizona\u2019s Painted Desert,\" according to a promotional website. \"This one-of-a-kind experience features songs arranged by West in the gospel tradition along with new music from his forthcoming album 'Jesus is King.'\u201d", "description": "Hallelu-Ye.
