Schrock, an Army veteran dealing with PTSD and debilitating knee injuries, said later that she didn\u2019t really mind coming in last.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of going sailing but never had the money for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe great thing about water is, you become part of it, part of its movement. \u2026 With my leg, I can\u2019t be active like I was, so this is a way to find the peace I lost.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA senior's intense, 14-day sailing lesson \u2014 from scratch \u2014 off the New Zealand coast\n\nSchrock is one of more than 600 people with disabilities (and hundreds of their family members and friends) who have benefited from CRAB\u2019s programming this year, said Paul Bollinger Jr., the group\u2019s executive director. In the roughly 30 years since CRAB\u2019s founding, that number probably stretches \u201ceasily\u201d into the tens of thousands, though 2019 will set an annual record, he said.\n\nPlus, Bollinger added, the group is poised to significantly expand and diversify its fleet of sailboats (currently around a half-dozen, with a bonus canoe). In 2020, CRAB plans to open a $3.5 million marina \u2014 an \u201cadaptive boating center,\u201d he said \u2014 in Annapolis, Md., specifically designed for boaters with disabilities. The marina will be funded through state and local government grants, according to Bollinger, as well as private donations.\n\n\u201cWhen we move to the boating center, we will potentially double our number of guests,\u201d said Bollinger, who left his job as a consultant in 2016 to lead CRAB full time. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to express what a boon this will be. \u2026 For [people with disabilities], sailing is therapeutic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s just an incredible experience.\u201d\n\nSaid Nicholas Abramczyk, a regular volunteer: \u201cCRAB provides something that can\u2019t even be put into words. \u2026 On boats, everybody is equal, all the same, and the disabilities just fall by the wayside.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnyone with a disability can sign up for a free CRAB sailing lesson, Bollinger explained: All they have to do is visit the group\u2019s website and enter their name in a slot. CRAB, which offers individual and group lessons, family sailing events and competitive regattas, can accommodate pretty much any kind of disability, Bollinger said: blindness, deafness, autism, muscular dystrophy, \u201creally anything you can think of.\u201d\n\nCRAB tweaked each of its boats in about a dozen ways \u2014 installing special blue seats, relocating various ropes (\u201clines,\u201d in sailor parlance) and modifying the sails, among other things \u2014 to allow people with limited mobility to sail without difficulty. The organization maintains one extra-special boat for quadriplegic people, Bollinger said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got a sip-and-puff system to steer the boat: One straw controls the sails; the other controls the rudder,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you sip on the sail straw, the sails come in; if you puff, they go out. If you sip on the rudder straw, the boat turns to port; if you puff, to starboard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTake Someone Sailing Day gives newbie sailors nautical skills\n\nOne quadriplegic person \u201csails with us regularly,\u201d Bollinger said. His ability to participate \u2014 to move freely and independently on the water \u2014 fulfills the decades-old vision of Don Backe, CRAB\u2019s founder, according to Bollinger.\n\nBacke, an avid sailor, was inspired to create CRAB after he was in a horrific car crash in his 50s that left him paralyzed from the waist down. The accident initially sank him into a deep depression \u2014 until a friend insisted he try sailing again. Backe, who died in 2013, found the experience so \u201cinvigorating and uplifting\u201d that he decided he had \u201cto do this for other people,\u201d Bollinger said.\n\nHe somehow finagled a donation of four sailboats, and CRAB was born.\n\nAD\n\nOver the years, the nonprofit \u2014 which has two full-time and three part-time employees and an annual budget of about $450,000 \u2014 has continued to fund itself mostly through donations, whether of old sailboats or cash, Bollinger said. It holds a large fundraising regatta and party each year at the Eastport Yacht Club, which typically brings in around $100,000, according to Bollinger.\n\nAD\n\nCRAB also relies on the services of about 100 volunteers, including about 40 extremely skilled sailors. These sailors \u2014 known as \u201cCRAB skippers\u201d \u2014 are vital to the nonprofit\u2019s ability to operate, Bollinger said. Each must possess decades of sailing experience, pass a background check and undergo rigorous CRAB-provided training on how to tutor sailors with disabilities.\n\nHer mom broke barriers with an all-female crew. She set sail on the same yacht.\n\nNo CRAB boat can leave the dock without at least one skipper aboard, Bollinger said, in addition to a volunteer crew, the person with disabilities and their chosen friends and family members. That\u2019s because CRAB doesn\u2019t just take people sailing for free \u2014 it teaches them how to sail, a fact Bollinger emphasized to Schrock and her peers at the sailing event last month, a Sept. 21 \u201cRecovering Warriors Sailing Regatta\u201d targeted to veterans with disabilities.\n\n\u201cWhen you leave here today, you\u2019ll know how to sail a boat,\u201d he told the assembled crowd of about two dozen people, just before setting them loose on the bay. He added a final injunction: \u201cIt\u2019s okay to talk smack from one boat to the other, just no throwing water bottles or anything like that.\u201d\n\nSchrock\u2019s first chance to \u201ctalk smack\u201d came early. (Though she didn\u2019t take it.) As she and her crew \u2014 including two close friends, Joseph and William Bailey, CRAB skipper Abramczyk and another volunteer, longtime sailor Peter Rony \u2014 motored out to the racecourse, another vessel cut in front of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll right, that\u2019s the last time we\u2019re getting passed today,\u201d Abramczyk joked.\n\nHe was wrong. Again and again over the course of the morning, other sailboats nosed ahead of CRAB Ship No. 4. Across five races \u2014 each comprising one or two laps of the yellow buoys \u2014 Schrock and her team notched fourth-, fifth- and last-place finishes.\n\nNonetheless, the mood in the boat \u2014 where Schrock steered as helmsman while the Bailey brothers helped wrangle the sails \u2014 was buoyant. Abramczyk and Rony provided advice and guidance (less and less, as Schrock grew more confident) from the back of the vessel, peppering their directions with insults tossed over the water to competing ships.\n\nEveryone soon came to the same conclusion: No. 4\u2032s poor finishes were not the fault of the top-notch crew, so cohesive and competent. It had to be the dastardly sea monster stuck to the bottom of the boat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDang that sea monster,\u201d Joseph Bailey said, as the crew headed back to harbor. \u201cThis is still the fun boat.\u201d\n\nWilliam Bailey slapped the side of the ship in agreement: \u201cC\u2019mon, fun boat, baby, party boat!\u201d\n\nHand still on the tiller, Schrock looked over and smiled. She had felt anxious at the start of the morning: Her PTSD stems from a traumatic sexual assault she experienced in the military, so she viewed the two unknown men (Abramczyk and Rony) with trepidation.\n\n\u201cI struggle to be around men,\u201d Schrock said. \u201cSo I was nervous going out \u2014 but once we got into the sailing, on the water, I was able to let loose a lot more.\u201d\n\nShe paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it. It was just. I felt okay. I felt okay being on that boat.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA \u2018miracle\u2019 and a \u2018shock\u2019: Months later, D.C. woman meets the stranger whose life she saved\n\nEmployees at this Florida bar pulled about $14,000 off the walls \u2014 and they\u2019re donating it to Hurricane Dorian relief\n\nThey met at a GM plant.
