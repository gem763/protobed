You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThese are the standout shows to know from day two.\n\nFyodor Golan\n\nDesigner duo Fyodor Podgorny and Golan Frydman are best known for the sense of playfulness they bring to their often bright and blithe collections.\n\nAnd this season was no different as their trademark positivism shone through with an iconic pop culture mash-up.\n\nFyodor Golan delivered yet another unique collaboration this London Fashion Week \u2013 they have previously joined forces with My Little Pony, the Power Puff Girls and Chupa Chups \u2013 this time combining the furry up-combed hair of Troll Dolls with their own signature style of vivid hues and elevated sportswear.\n\nThe references to the iconic figure brought a fantasy approach and touches of nostalgia to the line-up which included everything from negligee slip dresses that turned into pleated evening gowns to double denim.\n\n\u201cTrolls representation of bold positive individuality is just what we need right now,\u201d the designers said of the collaboration.\n\nWith backgrounds in fine art the designers\u2019 creative flair was also evident throughout with pastel psychedelic cloud prints, tie-dye tights and ruched dresses that gradated in colour.\n\nMeanwhile, a move towards zero-waste saw the duo present a range of up-cycled shoes that were created in collaboration with Kat Maconie.\n\nReusing the construction of the brand\u2019s spring/summer 2015 collaboration, the duo repurposed offcuts and production waste into the random buckled, multi-coloured strap design of a hardcore sandal.\n\n\u201cEvery element of the season had to go through both our hands,\u201d Fyodor Golan said.\n\n\u201cThis gave the collection a focus on craft with multiple connection points and an overload of references, we aimed to put across as empowering, individualistic and optimistic. Like a visual treasure for the mind.\u201d\n\nPorts 1961\n\nFollowing the departure of creative director Natasa Cagalj in April this year, Ports 1961 pledged to take its offerings in a new direction.\n\nWith a fresh creative team \u2013 stylist Karl Templer and art director Fabien Baron took the helm in August \u2013 this season did just that, with the brand seemingly breaking free from the restraints of traditional design.\n\nThe luxe laid-back tailoring Ports has become known for was present but this time it came in painterly colours and prints that spanned everything from artistic scenery and graphic broken checks to hibiscus florals.\n\nAs well as finessed workwear staples \u2013 think jumpsuits that resemble tailored two-piece suits and satin button downs \u2013 there was renewed focus on accessories with double-sided bags, mixed-material jewellery and sandals that, while inherently stylish, were made to be worn every day.\n\nTempler undoubtedly assembled a collection signalling the brand\u2019s new beginnings but, as always, the clothes were ready for the real world.\n\nHouse of Holland\n\nWe can always rely on Henry Holland to put a smile on our faces in times of uncertainty.\n\nAs the possibility of a no-deal Brexit looms closer, today House of Holland brought party vibes to London Fashion Week with a collection inspired by 1970s disco and the rave culture of the 1990s.\n\nDelivering an archetypal nighttime wardrobe, models, including Holland\u2019s longtime friend Pixie Geldof, sauntered down the runway in \u201clook-at-me\u201d dresses and \u201cdon\u2019t-touch-me\u201d tailoring.\n\nThe party vibes didn\u2019t stop there with the FROW reading like a who\u2019s who of the current celebrity sphere, including A-list attendees like RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race winner Aquaria, Billie Porter and Sex Education\u2019s Ncuti Gatwa.\n\nWhile dark denim remained a key element in the collection, bright neons and pastel shades of pink dominated alongside textured snake skin and animal print jacquard. Pieces that will undoubtedly appeal to the House of Holland girl.\n\nThere was however, one minor let-down. Like last season, which saw Holland launch his own vape pen with Vype, today saw the designer's name-making slogan T-shirt become an advert for pay-later shopping app Klarna while a second range of athletic garb designed in collaboration with sportswear brand Xtep (China) crept in midway through the spectacle and made the show feel less like one from the creative hub of fashion week and more like a sponsorship opportunity.\n\nRixo\n\nLaunched by two best friends from university, Henrietta Rix and Orlagh McCloskey, Rixo was spawned out of their mutual love of vintage clothes \u2013 and a desire to bring the shapes, patterns and styles to a wider audience. And it was an immediate hit when it launched in 2015. You can almost guarantee that you\u2019ll spot one of their Seventies-cut tea dresses at every wedding you go to, or at least see them taking over your Instagram feed.\n\nThis season, the pair took their love of the Seventies to extremes, showing a collection inspired by the hazy days of Woodstock, featuring psychedelic prints, pieced together bits of clashing fabrics and flowing, bias-cut dresses, alongside a heady dose of flower power\n\nModels at the Chelsea presentation danced and jived and blew bubbles on a grass platform (\u201cThe grass is from this amazing place called Wow Grass \u2013 it\u2019s all made from recycled British fabrics and it grows from there. We\u2019ll donate it all tomorrow\u201d) to the dulcet tones of Nancy Sinatra and The Zombies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obsessed with Woodstock and Joni Mitchell,\u201d Rix tells The Independent. \u201cShe\u2019s the inspiration for the collection. She couldn\u2019t make it to Woodstock but her song \u2018Back to The Garden\u2019 inspired this collection.\u201d\n\nPresented on a diverse range of models including influencers, women in their seventies and an eight-month pregnant woman, the spring/summer 2020 collection, Rix says, \u201cits all about being happy and fun\u201d. And that feeling is felt through every item they design.", "description": "*/ There was a playful spirit running through London Fashion Week today, from a show staged on real grass that transported attendees back to the free-spirited era of the 1970s to troll-inspired hair perched atop model\u2019s heads and a disco-ready collection designed for a night on the town.", "authors": ["Sarah Young", "Harriet Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/19/ports.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
