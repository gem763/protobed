Morris wanted to help him do so but did not because of Centura\u2019s policy against it.\n\nInstead, they filed a lawsuit in state court asking a judge to decide whether she could help him because Centura\u2019s policy allegedly violated state law. She was fired days later.\n\nCentura, which was formed by Catholic and Seventh-day Adventist health care ministries, moved the case to federal court. Lawyers for Mahoney and Morris are trying to get it moved back to state court. At their request, a judge on Thursday granted their request for a quick decision because of Mahoney\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much Centura tries to delay this case procedurally, in the end a court of law is going to decide whether Centura can enter the hospital business but willfully ignore Colorado laws governing all hospitals, whether religious or otherwise,\u201d said Jason Spitalnick, a lawyer representing Mahoney and Morris.\n\nMorris worked for a Catholic hospital within Centura, St. Anthony Hospital. Directives forbid Catholic hospitals from participating in euthanasia or assisted suicide in any way. Centura says those prohibitions apply to its employees who carry out its mission.\n\nBanko said Centura feels for what Mahoney and his family are facing and said he hopes the courts will act quickly.\n\nCentura\u2019s religious freedom argument fits within the constitutional doctrine of church autonomy, developed over the years, in which courts have usually chosen not to interfere with the decisions and autonomy of all kinds of religious institutions, including hospitals and non-profit organizations, said Frank S. Ravitch, the chair of the law and religion program at Michigan State University\u2019s law school.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether a doctor would be seen as a kind of \u201cminister\u201d of the hospital group or not, he said. It is also possible that Morris could argue that Centura\u2019s policy was interfering with her doctor-patient relationship and her ability to provide the best care to her patient, he said.\n\n\u201cThe doctrine of autonomy has a more limited application in this context,\u201d Ravitch said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Christian-affiliated health system in a court fight over Colorado's assisted suicide law says the state can't stop religious organization from disciplining employees who encourage the option in violation of its beliefs.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Colleen Slevin"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
