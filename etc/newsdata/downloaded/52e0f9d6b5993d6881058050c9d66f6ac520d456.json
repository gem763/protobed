Mandy has turned up, but she and Chas are getting on OK. From the very beginning Chas says \u201cyou look at him the wrong way and I\u2019ll rip your head off and spit down your neck\u201d. I love that line!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She\u2019s set her stall out and when Mandy goes to the ante-natal class with Paddy, Chas doesn\u2019t really get angry. Mandy\u2019s always going to be there in the background but I don\u2019t think Chas feels threatened by her at this point because they\u2019re starting afresh and are just about to have this baby. Everything that happened last year is hopefully going to be made more palatable by the arrival of this new baby and hopefully can only make them stronger.\n\n\u2018They haven\u2019t really had much focus on the birth, apart from Paddy wanting to go to ante-natal classes. Chas was very much not wanting to only because of the questions she might be asked by the other mums, she feels like she\u2019ll have to bring up what happened to Grace.\n\n\u2018But Paddy and Chas have been absolutely fine, there hasn\u2019t been much scare-mongering, just anticipation knowing that it\u2019s going to happen.\u2019\n\nLong may the fine-ness continue!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Lucy Pargeter opens up on what's ahead.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_chas_marlon-c457_1571511579.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
