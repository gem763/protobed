Mr. Sanders has suggested various possible tax increases that could pay for this expansion, including a payroll tax that would affect workers across the economic spectrum. He has not provided enough details about the mix and magnitude of taxes for economists to measure what sorts of families would be better or worse off under Medicare for all. An Urban Institute analysis of Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 health care proposal, which included more tax details, found that the proposed taxes would only pay for about half of the cost of the plan.\n\nWhat they\u2019re talking about\n\nElizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, repeatedly avoided answering a question about whether financing her health care plan would require middle-class tax increases, saying instead that their \u201ccosts\u201d would not go up.\n\nWhat Ms. Warren said:\n\n\u201cI have made clear what my principles are here. And that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard working middle class families, costs will go down.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren has indeed proposed a number of large tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, including a new wealth tax, a corporate profits tax, and an expansion of Social Security taxes up the income spectrum. But she has also earmarked close to all of the revenue raised by those taxes to pay for other domestic spending priorities, including free public college tuition and child care subsidies.\n\nA \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care program, like the one from Senator Bernie Sanders that Ms. Warren has co-sponsored, would require substantial additional government spending. Ms. Warren would not say who would pay tax increases necessary to fund it. But it may be hard to squeeze that much more money out of the rich and corporations alone, beyond the new taxes she has already suggested. Her language about \u201ccosts\u201d does provide the possibility that she would raise middle class taxes, but ensure that middle class families would save enough on health care spending to come out ahead.", "description": "Our reporters are following all of the exchanges and fact-checking the candidates, providing context and explanation on the policy debates.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/us/politics/15dc-debatefactcheck/15dc-debatefactcheck-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
