For me, it\u2019s like putting on a suit in the morning.\u201d\n\nHe complained that after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s extensive probe into Russian election meddling and potential obstruction of justice by the White House, he got only \u201cthree days of peace\u201d before the threat of impeachment cast a cloud over the second half of his term.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived with this cloud now for almost three years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president lamented that former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) \u201cwould never give anybody a subpoena,\u201d hesitating when Trump\u2019s defenders wanted to use congressional powers to investigate Democrats and the FBI. By contrast, he said, Pelosi was a subpoena-approving machine.\n\nTrump also embraced a sense of victimhood-by-proxy for his aides, some of whom were implicated in Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\n\u201cThey came down to Washington to do a great job,\u201d he said of his aides, claiming that the investigations had \u201cdestroyed\u201d them. \u201cThey left Washington dark.\u201d\n\nBut Trump also presented himself as the battle-scarred victor who was uniquely capable of fighting back against his perceived enemies and on behalf of his supporters.\n\nIn describing how he has survived the \u201cgreatest hoax\u201d in history and a \u201cfraudulent crime on the American people,\u201d he cited conservative media figures.\n\n\u201cPeople have said to me, how does he handle it?\u201d Trump said. \u201cRush Limbaugh said, \u2018I don\u2019t know of any man in America that could handle it.\u2019 Sean Hannity said the same thing.\u201d", "description": "As the impeachment inquiry in the House barrels forward, his embrace of victimhood grows more pronounced.", "authors": ["Eugene Scott", "Reporter Covering Identity Politics For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TW904wtz3jJYECK-TbqNmpUf_kg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLS6G6XUFQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
