We are more than prepared to continue to do that,\u201d baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday at the World Series. \u201cAgainst that backdrop, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for us to expect that we have facilities that are first class for some of the greatest athletes in the world, that we have league alignments that produce travel that is reasonable and not onerous for those same athletes. And I think over the long haul, minor league baseball will be at the table and prepared to discuss those things.\u201d\n\nMLB thinks some of the substandard facilities are in the low minors at teams with low attendance.\n\n\u201cMany of those franchises averaged less than two thousand people a game,\u201d Manfred said, \u201cThey\u2019re really not major drivers of the attendance in the minor leagues. And again, our preference was never to reduce numbers. It was to get the first-rate facilities. If we can\u2019t get the first-rate facilities, I\u2019m not sure it makes sense for us to send people to playing facilities that are inadequate and continue to subsidize those inadequate facilities.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Major League Baseball wants the minor leagues to upgrade ballparks and decrease long travel.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
