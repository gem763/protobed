Kacper Pempel//File Photo\n\nThe Russian group, known as \u201cTurla\u201d and accused by Estonian and Czech authorities of operating on behalf of Russia\u2019s FSB security service, has used Iranian tools and computer infrastructure to successfully hack in to organizations in at least 20 different countries over the last 18 months, British security officials said.\n\nThe hacking campaign, the extent of which has not been previously revealed, was most active in the Middle East but also targeted organizations in Britain, they said.\n\nPaul Chichester, a senior official at Britain\u2019s GCHQ intelligence agency, said the operation shows state-backed hackers are working in a \u201cvery crowded space\u201d and developing new attacks and methods to better cover their tracks.\n\nIn a statement accompanying a joint advisory with the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), GCHQ\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre said it wanted to raise industry awareness about the activity and make attacks more difficult for its adversaries.\n\n\u201cWe want to send a clear message that even when cyber actors seek to mask their identity, our capabilities will ultimately identify them,\u201d said Chichester, who serves as the NCSC\u2019s director of operations.\n\nOfficials in Russia and Iran did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent on Sunday. Moscow and Tehran have both repeatedly denied Western allegations over hacking.\n\nGLOBAL HACKING CAMPAIGNS\n\nWestern officials rank Russia and Iran as two of the most dangerous threats in cyberspace, alongside China and North Korea, with both governments accused of conducting hacking operations against countries around the world.\n\nIntelligence officials said there was no evidence of collusion between Turla and its Iranian victim, a hacking group known as \u201cAPT34\u201d which cybersecurity researchers at firms including FireEye FEYE.O say works for the Iranian government.\n\nRather, the Russian hackers infiltrated the Iranian group\u2019s infrastructure in order to \u201cmasquerade as an adversary which victims would expect to target them,\u201d said GCHQ\u2019s Chichester.\n\nTurla\u2019s actions show the dangers of wrongly attributing cyberattacks, British officials said, but added that they were not aware of any public incidents that had been incorrectly blamed on Iran as a result of the Russian operation.\n\nThe United States and its Western allies have also used foreign cyberattacks to facilitate their own spying operations, a practice referred to as \u201cfourth party collection,\u201d according to documents released by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden and reporting by German magazine Der Spiegel.\n\nGCHQ declined to comment on Western operations.\n\nBy gaining access to the Iranian infrastructure, Turla was able to use APT34\u2019s \u201ccommand and control\u201d systems to deploy its own malicious code, GCHQ and the NSA said in a public advisory.\n\nThe Russian group was also able to access the networks of existing APT34 victims and even access the code needed to build its own \u201cIranian\u201d hacking tools.", "description": "Russian hackers piggy-backed on an Iranian cyber-espionage operation to attack government and industry organizations in dozens of countries while masquerading as attackers from the Islamic Republic, British and U.S. officials said on Monday.", "authors": ["Jack Stubbs", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443215246&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K074", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
