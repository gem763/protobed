Upon graduation, several in the group vowed to keep in touch and did so, writing each other Round Robin letters each year for six decades.\n\nIn the spring of 1956, the newly-graduated sisters of Gamma Phi Beta left their brick Tudor sorority house at Iowa State College and scattered across the country, promising to keep in touch.\n\nThey have. In February, as in the six decades past, each of the sorority sisters received a thick envelope in the mail containing a packet of individual letters from the others. Opening with Dear Sisters or Dear Gamma Phis, each woman\u2019s letter relates the year\u2019s highlights. \u201cWe were all at the same point in life when we met, and did a lot of growing up together,\u201d says Connie King Osborne, 84.\n\nThrough that annual exchange, which they call the Round Robin, the sisters have maintained ties over time and distance, sharing life\u2019s passages from the birth of children to the death of parents and more recently spouses, many college sweethearts. They laughed when one sister described accidentally wearing a wig backwards during a three-day women\u2019s education convention\u2014\u201cThe bangs seemed so short!\u201d\u2014and cried when Jane Miller LaMair wrote, \u201cThis is my goodbye letter.\u201d Diagnosed with cancer, she knew she wouldn\u2019t live to write another one.\n\nNineteen sisters were in the Round Robin when they started. Five have died. One no longer sends a letter. The remaining 13, many widowed, are in their mid-80s and scattered among 11 states.\n\nSome of the friends who would later write Round Robin letters for decades attended the sorority\u2019s flapper-themed party in 1953.

Some of their now-adult children help address envelopes or take dictation if needed, knowing the importance of the tradition to their mothers.\n\n\u201cI really envy them that closeness,\u201d says Carole Tillotson, who has helped her mom, Karla Baur Tillotson, type the letters in recent years. Carole had never read the letters before she began helping and was struck by their optimism and sense of sisterhood.\n\nLetter-writing is largely a forgotten craft, especially in an era of texting and social media, but one that has value in deepening connections. The many details included in a single-spaced typewritten page, and the effort behind it, allowed them to feel close in spite of their distance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost six decades of conversations through those letters,\u201d says Tami Osborne Pederson, Connie\u2019s daughter. \u201cOur generation would have gone the easier route.\u201d\n\nIn her 1963 Round Robin letter, Alice Aita Newton described living in San Francisco, traveling around the world and looking for Prince Charming.

Even as their lives, their health and circumstances change, the missives, arriving like gifts, have remained a welcome and reassuring constant. \u201cIt always makes me smile when I read them,\u201d says Gamma Phi sister Kathie Arnold Ervin. \u201cThey bring back happy memories of our time together.\u201d\n\nSorority Sisters\n\nThe women were in their late teens when they pledged to the sorority at Iowa State College (now Iowa State University) in 1952. Most were from towns across the Midwest, on their own for the first time, looking for connection and finding it in Gamma Phi Beta, which was founded on the values of \u201clove, learning, labor, loyalty.\u201d\n\nThey lived together in the three-story house on sorority circle, under the watchful but caring eye of Mrs. Rhea Dahl, the housemother. Sue Kelley Harbour remembers confiding to Mrs. Dahl that she might have to quit the sorority because of grades. Mrs. Dahl offered to let her study in the kitchen, where it was quiet. \u201cShe was a swell person,\u201d says Sue.\n\nAll were home-economics majors, one of the few fields available to women. It included textiles and design, applied arts and household equipment, which meant learning about the latest refrigerators, washers and ranges. It would prepare them for marriage, career or both, the home economics dean said at the time.\n\nSenior yearbook portraits of some of those in the Round Robin over the years: (Top row from left, maiden names) Alice Aita, Kathie Arnold, Karla Baur, Maralyn Brown, Judy DeHaan, Mary 'Zibbie' Dickerson, Ellen Eames.

They built floats for homecoming, knitted socks for charities and regularly took first place in swimming, volleyball and singing competitions. \u201cWe had a sextet that did a song and dance routine, singing \u2018Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\u2019 and doing the Charleston,\u201d says Mary Dickerson Wolter, whose nickname is Zibbie.\n\nMany hoped to find their mate and did, rushing back to tell sisters when they got pinned\u2014given a boyfriend\u2019s fraternity pin, signaling he was serious\u2014and celebrating with cookies and punch. Ten of the 19 sisters met their husbands at Iowa State. In later years, the husbands would often read the Round Robin letters to keep up with their own friends.\n\nWhen graduation came, the 19 Gamma Phi sisters were eager to start the next chapter of their lives, but didn\u2019t want to lose touch.\n\n\u201cAll of us were real close. We thought it would be nice to keep up with each other,\u201d says Sue.\n\nSomeone, they can\u2019t remember who, suggested starting a Round Robin, a type of progressive letter. Each would write a letter annually and send it to a designated sister, who would then make copies and mail the packets to everyone, usually around Valentine\u2019s Day. They took turns being the one in charge and dutifully updated addresses and phone numbers as the sisters moved over the years to places like Glacier, Wash. (pop. 100), and Saudi Arabia. No one wanted to let the others down.\n\n\u201cThere is so little to do here. The school had one little league baseball team and 80 kids tried out for 15 positions. Transportation is such a problem for women (we can\u2019t drive) that there are very few organized activities,\u201d wrote Sarah Pyles Davis in 1977 from Saudi Arabia, where her husband was stationed with the U.S. Air Force. In later years, Sarah became the contact person if any sister was sick or lost a loved one. She would alert the others so they could call or send cards or flowers, often pink carnations, the sorority flower.\n\nLiving together at the Gamma Phi Beta house tightened the bond of the sisters, who ate, bunked and studied together under the watchful eye of their housemother, Mrs. Rhea Dahl. Photo: Carole Tillotson\n\nFamily Life\n\nAll the sisters married, two while they were still in college. Sue LaGrange Peterson, the sorority president, who went by Sue La, married the same day she graduated. Two sorority sisters were in her wedding. Connie married two days after graduation in a small ceremony at her family\u2019s farm. Mrs. Dahl, the housemother, gave her a cookbook.\n\nTheir children began arriving within a few years. \u201cCatherine Kelley Harbour was born July 31 at U. of Ky. Medical Center. She\u2019s chunky and has multitudinous brown hair which sticks up and out,\u201d Sue wrote in 1970. As more children arrived, the mothers traded stories about their hectic lives, knowing the others could relate.\n\n\u201cBrian is two and more trouble than the other two.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI feel like an Army Sergeant trying to keep the two boys in line.\u201d... \u201cOur oldest drives us all nutty with his football.\u201d... \u201cMy \u2018baby\u2019 started kindergarten this fall. I must be an abnormal mother because I didn\u2019t feel any sadness at all.\u201d One mother of a 10-year-old daughter longed for the return of \u201cVictorian prudery.\u201d That was in 1970, the year after Woodstock.\n\nThe teen years were more difficult. One sister wrote of her son\u2019s suicide attempt and the hospitalization and long treatment that followed. \u201cThanks for listening\u2014for reading\u2014for understanding. As I said, it sometimes takes the bad years to make the good years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI love you all.\u201d\n\nSue LaGrange, sorority president, fourth from left, graduated from Iowa State in the morning and got married the same evening. Sorority sisters and future Round Robin writers Judy DeHaan, second from left, and Miriam McKee, third from left, were among her bridesmaids. Photo: Sue LaGrange Peterson/Deborah Meyer\n\nThey confided other concerns. Miriam McKee Cerveny was 36 and had just celebrated her 10th anniversary when she mentioned in her letter that she lost feeling in her right leg, \u201cwhich is most disconcerting.\u201d Subsequent letters chronicled the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and its progression. Her sisters were worried but heartened by her resilience and humor. She would give a brief update on her MS, which she called her \u201cdumb disease\u201d followed with \u201cenough of that,\u201d and proceed recounting an amusing discussion between her daughter who wanted pierced ears and her husband, who suggested using an ice pick.\n\nWith their children barely out of the house, they began caring for aging parents. Kaye Johndreau Davis\u2019s mother lived with her for 17 years and suffered from depression. \u201cMom recovered once again from a bout with her recurrent depression, receiving electro-convulsive therapy via the local geriatric assessment program,\u201d she wrote to her sisters in 1997. There was an honesty among them, she says. \u201cIt was just what we were going through. I think it\u2019s important to share that, too.\u201d\n\nThey shared the loss of parents, siblings and children. \u201cWe always helped each other carry hard times,\u201d says Judy DeHaan Hetzer. She remembers the sisters reaching out to her after her son Jim died at the age of 26. He was born with heart disease and over the years she would update them about his health. \u201cEven knowing from his birth that his life expectancy was limited, his death was a great shock,\u201d she wrote in 1988. \u201cIt is true that time helps us to heal, but it is also true that it is a very slow and painful process.\u201d\n\nA new chapter in the letters began in the late 1970s when the first of their children married. Grandchildren arrived over the next decade. \u201cOur letters reflect the seasons of our lives so much, the loss of parents, marriage and now grandchildren,\u201d wrote one sister in the late 1980s.\n\nJudy DeHaan Hetzer kept her sisters updated each year about her son, Jim, who had heart disease. In her 1988 letter, she told them that he had died at the age of 26. Photo: Deborah Meyer \u2018This is my goodbye letter,\u2019 Jane Miller LaMair wrote to her sisters in 2016. She had cancer and knew she wouldn't be around to write another Round Robin. Photo: Deborah Meyer\n\nJudy DeHaan Hetzer kept her sisters updated each year about her son, Jim, who had heart disease.

Photo: Deborah Meyer\n\n\u2018Somehow I thought I was going to live to 99 like my mother did,\u2019 wrote Jane Miller LaMair in her final Round Robin letter to her sorority sisters. Photo: Deborah Meyer\n\nWorking\n\nAfter graduating, the sisters who didn\u2019t get married right away pursued their careers. Sue Kelley got a master\u2019s degree and then spent the next eight years teaching early childhood development at the University of Kentucky. Karla pursued the career of her dreams, working for \u201cBetter Homes and Gardens,\u201d editing and compiling recipes for cookbooks.\n\nAlice Aita Newton went to Kansas City, Mo., and worked for Hallmark, designing greeting cards, then moved to San Francisco, where she worked for several years before deciding to travel around the world. \u201cMy plane ticket is good for a year so unless I meet Prince Charming, I\u2019ll be back next year at this time,\u201d she wrote to her sisters in 1963. While loving her adventure, she read their letters about their families and wanted the same for herself. \u201cIt sounds like you all have such nice families and homes. I hope some day I can be one of you. Being single is great so long as it doesn\u2019t last forever.\u201d\n\nThe sisters who did get married put whatever career aspirations they had on hold to raise children. Some had little choice.\n\nSoon after she married in 1956, Connie moved to Nebraska, where her husband had a job at a dairy, and applied for a job teaching home economics. \u201cThe nice placement lady said we aren\u2019t hiring married women,\u201d she recalls, the explanation being that married women would get pregnant and leave. She eventually got a job with the local gas company traveling to neighboring communities to teach women how to cook pineapple upside-down cake in a skillet on the new gas stoves that had \u201cburners with a brain.\u201d When she became pregnant, she remembers her boss telling her, \u201cWe really want you back but your place is at home.\u201d\n\nShe raised her children and ran a piano studio, teaching 35 students. In the late 1970s, she and her husband bought a book bindery and soon she was traveling to conventions throughout the country and making sales calls. \u201cLong days\u2014fun and challenging, but then sometimes exhausting and irritating,\u201d she wrote in 1978. At one point, when she was in charge of sending out the Round Robin, she surprised the sisters by compiling that year\u2019s letters into a bound book.\n\nAlong with the annual letters to keep them in touch, the Gamma Phi Beta sisters have had five reunions, including one in 2001 in Scottsdale, Ariz., when Connie King Osborne made T-shirts with a picture of their sorority house on the front. Photo: Sarah Pyles Davis\n\nKarla resumed her cookbook development career after her children went to school. \u201cIn October I went to work\u2014I think I\u2019m out of my mind, but I do love it!\u201d she wrote in 1978. She told them that she was working on a cookbook for Whirlpool to go with its new \u201ccombination range,\u201d a conventional oven with a microwave unit. \u201cIt\u2019s slick!\u201d she wrote.\n\nKaye started a preschool when her oldest was in first grade and spent the next 30 years in early education, the bulk with the Head Start Program, a government-funded early childhood learning program for low-income families. Zibbie became an occupational therapist, working with children who had intellectual and developmental disabilities. In spite of her multiple sclerosis, Miriam returned to work when her children were in school as a research home economist at Oscar Mayer, developing taste tests for new products.\n\nSome returned to school. Marilyn Nelson Kern, who goes by Minnie, obtained two more degrees, the latest when she was 44. \u201cI received my Masters in August after much blood, sweat, tears and strange meals for my family as I dashed off to class,\u201d she wrote in 1978. Two decades later, she was still teaching. \u201cSome days I think it would be fun to not work so hard. Then I think \u2018How can I ever give this up?\u2019 Retirement for me is still an unknown.\u201d\n\nWhen they retired, many worked in the community. One sister raised funds for a home for abused children, the symphony and YWCA. Another was chair of her local hospital board.\n\nLater Years\n\nAging is the latest passage they share.\n\n\u201cCan it be possible this bird has flown for so many years? I still look back at our years together with such fond memories, laugh at the funny things and crying at the sad, always being thankful that the Lord put us all together for our special times,\u201d one sister wrote in 2017.\n\nSeveral lost husbands in recent years. \u201cPlease know that we all care about you and are sorry for your loss,\u201d wrote Kaye in this year\u2019s letter.\n\nMany moved to retirement communities. \u201cI\u2019m in the home. You know what that means!\u201d Sue La half-joked in 2017, announcing that she was in a senior-living community. Her daughter Deborah Meyer typed the letter while her mother dictated it. Growing up, Deborah heard about the Round Robin and knew her mother cherished the letters. Now, they are even more of a gift. Her mother\u2019s short-term memory is weak, but her recollection of college days and sorority sisters is strong. Sue La keeps the letters in a basket by her chair and rereads them often.\n\nIn 2017, Sue Kelley Harbour, left, invited recently widowed Karla Baur Tillotson, center, for a weekend visit to Lexington, Ky. Kaye Johndreau Davis, right, joined them. Karla\u2019s daughter, Carole, was moved by their gesture, which gave her mom a much-needed getaway. Photo: Carole Tillotson\n\nKaye has a housemate, Barbara, and a social life again. She belongs to a Gamma Phi alum book club and recently finished \u201cEducated\u201d by Tara Westover. Miriam is in assisted living. \u201cMy hands still work, my mouth still works and my mind still works, happily so,\u201d says Miriam.\n\nSue volunteers at an Alzheimer\u2019s day center and watches \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes\u201d reruns with her husband, Paul Harbour, while enjoying a glass of Kendall-Jackson wine. She has a new hip, which she loves. \u201cThe only thing I can\u2019t do ever again is play basketball. Well damn!\u201d\n\nAll wrote about how much they missed Jane Miller LaMair, who had cancer and wrote her last letter in 2016.\n\nJane\u2019s daughter, Teresa Jenson, remembers her mother writing it. \u201cIt was a testament to how close they were to each other,\u201d she says. \u201cThey met the challenges of life together.\u201d\n\nWrite to Clare Ansberry at clare.ansberry@wsj.com", "description": "Since 1956, a tight-knit group of sorority sisters have helped each other through weddings, careers, children and old age by writing letters; \u2018Our letters reflect the seasons of our lives so much.\u2019", "authors": ["Clare Ansberry"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111513/social", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
