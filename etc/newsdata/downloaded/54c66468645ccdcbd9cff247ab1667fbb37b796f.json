It\u2019s just happy to be there, to be honest.\n\n\u201cHi @HeinzUK,\u201d Councillor Steve Smith took to Twitter, \u201cI enjoy \u201cbean juice\u201d as much as the next person, but when I opened a can this evening I was hoping for more than one bean.\u201d\n\nHi @HeinzUK. I enjoy \"bean juice\" as much as the next person, but when I opened a can this evening I was hoping for more than one bean. pic.twitter.com/EgNDiK8mGt \u2014 Cllr Steve Smith (@SteveSmith98) September 3, 2019\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Smith elaborated: \u201cI got back late from a residents\u2019 meeting and wanted some food. I poured out the tin and I found one bean. I thought it was funny \u2013 but annoying. It was the last tin we had in the cupboard.\u201d\n\nThe last dreaded tin in the cupboard?\n\n\u201cI had to have scrambled egg instead.\u201d\n\nHeinz UK\u2019s Twitter account responded: \u201cHi Steve, sorry to see this, please DM us your details and codes from underneath the can, thanks\u201d\n\nJustice for Steve. May he receive a lifetime\u2019s supply of the toot-producing goods.", "description": "", "authors": ["Louis Hanson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/onebean.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
