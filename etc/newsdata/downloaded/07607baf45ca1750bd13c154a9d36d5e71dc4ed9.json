Jonathan Atkins/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nThe fund\u2019s administrator, Link Fund Solutions (LFS), said on Tuesday that it had taken the decision to close the fund - which has been suspended - because Woodford\u2019s efforts to sell down his illiquid holdings and move into liquid stocks ahead of a planned December reopening of the fund had not gone to plan.\n\nIt is the latest blow to storied stockpicker Woodford, once a darling of retail investors, who has seen his reputation tarnished after a liquidity crisis forced him to stop clients leaving the 3.7 billion pound ($4.6 billion) Equity Income Fund in June.\n\nNeil Woodford, in a separate statement, firmly rejected the move to shut the fund and oust him as manager.\n\n\u201cThis was Link\u2019s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.\u201d\n\nWoodford will cease to be the investment manager of the fund with immediate effect and the fund\u2019s assets will be split into two portfolios managed by others, LFS said in a statement.\n\nBlackRock Advisors will take charge of selling the fund\u2019s listed assets while PJT Partners will continue with its previously agreed role in helping to sell the fund\u2019s highly illiquid assets, Link said.\n\nShares in Neil Woodford\u2019s separate listed fund Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT) (WPCT.L), which shares some of the same holdings as the suspended fund, slid to a record low at the open, and by 0703 GMT were trading down 8% at 34.75 pence a share.\n\nThe winding up of LF Woodford Equity Income Fund - which will be stripped of Woodford\u2019s name - will begin on Jan. 17, 2020, and will allow an initial payment to be made to investors.\n\nAt the heart of Woodford\u2019s troubles was the scale of his holdings in unlisted or illiquid assets, which are hard to sell quickly.\n\nLFS said the fund had risked being subjected to a further extension of its suspension and potentially unequal treatment of investors, particularly those who chose to remain invested in the fund.\n\n\u201cWhilst progress has been made in relation to repositioning the Fund\u2019s assets, this has unfortunately not been sufficient to allow reasonable certainty as to when the repositioning would be fully achieved and the Fund could be re-opened,\u201d Link said in a letter to investors.\n\n\u201cLFS has concluded that an orderly realization of the Fund\u2019s assets allows the return of money through interim payments to investors more quickly than if the Fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.\u201d\n\nIn choosing BlackRock, LFS said the company, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, was \u201cbest placed to carry out this role due to its transition and investment management, trading and capital markets expertise and experience\u201d.\n\nWoodford Patient Capital Trust said it noted the decision by Link and was continuing to review its own management arrangements, with a further announcement in due course.", "description": "Neil Woodford has been ousted as manager of his flagship LF Woodford Equity Income Fund, which will now be wound up to pay back investors trapped in the fund since June.", "authors": ["Simon Jessop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441004231&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0BP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
