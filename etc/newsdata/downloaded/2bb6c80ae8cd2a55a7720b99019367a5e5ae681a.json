It\u2019s a very modest piece of clothing to wear.'\n\nCalling it 'really sensible', Susie added: 'It\u2019s practical and teamed with the right outfit it can look elegant.'\n\nKate has opted for the high neck style for years, with stylist Susie pointing to the versatility and practicality as an attraction for the royal (pictured, visiting Caernarfon Coastguard Search and Rescue Helicopter Base in May 2019)\n\nSusie also pointed out that the tops perfectly flatters Kate's slim figure, saying: 'They work really for Kate\u2019s shape as she\u2019s very slender.'\n\nShe revealed: 'If you wear a polo neck with a big bust or you\u2019re broad on your top half, it\u2019s not going to be flattering, because the breasts will end up looking like they're part of the neck.'\n\nSusie said: 'When you have a small bust and narrow hips, a polo neck will balance out the rest of your outfit.'\n\n'The roll neck is a really good way of adding shape to a slender figure, so that might be why Kate is opting for it.'\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge often opts for the high-neck style when working with children, with Susie suggested the style allowed her to be hands-on and practical without fearing a wardrobe malfunction (pictured, visiting the Cub Scouts in Essex in March 2019)\n\nKate has been seen in a selection of different polo necks in a variety of colours over the years.\n\nIn February 2012, she donned a black polo neck beneath a burgundy coat, and opted for a similar look in October 2018 and in May 2019.\n\nOn each occasion, she opted for smart black jeans and ankle boots for the outings.\n\nThe Duchess also donned the practical style on two occasions while paying visit to the Scouts.\n\nThe royal has treated the high-neck top as a wardrobe staple for years (pictured, in February 2012, during a visit to the Adler Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust)\n\nIn December 2016, Kate wore a \u00a3170 cashmere highneck jumper from Iris and Ink and skintight jeans, accessorized with knee-length boots and her Scout scarf and woggle.\n\nMeanwhile in May 2019, she opted for a J.Crew Mockneck Jumper in burgundy, and paired it with her trusty brown Chloe Liegi suede ankle boots, and her khaki Barbour jacket.\n\nAnd yesterday the royal stepped out in different polo neck, this time from high street retailer Warehouse.\n\nShe paired the plum coloured 'Wave Pointelle Detail Jumper' with khaki culottes from Jigsaw and heeled loafers from Tod's.", "description": "Stylist Susie Hasler has revealed the secret behind Kate Middleton's, 37, love of the elegant, yet sensible polo neck, after the royal stepped out in a purple scalloped high-necked top yesterday.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/12/19537214-0-image-a-93_1570708234608.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
