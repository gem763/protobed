No one is above the law,\u201d said Pelosi, who for months had been reluctant to embrace an impeachment effort.\n\nTrump fired back quickly on Twitter, calling the inquiry \u201cWitch Hunt garbage.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s change of heart followed reports that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to investigate Biden, the Democratic presidential front-runner, and his son Hunter, who had worked for a company drilling for gas in Ukraine.\n\nTrump promised on Tuesday to release a transcript of his phone call. He has acknowledged he discussed Biden in the call, but denied he withheld nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Zelenskiy to launch a probe that would damage Biden, who leads opinion polls in the Democratic presidential race.\n\nPelosi said the six congressional committees currently investigating Trump would continue with their probes as part of the inquiry. Those panels would work collaboratively, and then decide whether the House Judiciary Committee should draft articles of impeachment, House aides said.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Trump presidency revealed a dishonourable fact of the president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nCongressional allies of Trump accused Pelosi of playing politics with the decision. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it \u201ca rush to judgement,\u201d saying it should have waited until after details of the phone call were revealed.\n\n\u201cIt simply confirms that House Democrats\u2019 priority is not making life better for the American people, but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry could eventually lead to Trump\u2019s removal from office, although that would be a steep task for Democrats. Even if the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump, the Republican-majority Senate would have to take the next step of removing him from office after a trial. A conviction would require a two-thirds Senate majority.\n\nIt will be the first impeachment inquiry in Congress since the 1998 probe of President Bill Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice in relation to his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThe House voted to impeach Clinton in December 1998, but the Democratic president was acquitted two months later by the Senate and remained in office. The only other president to be impeached, Andrew Johnson in 1868, was also acquitted by the Senate.\n\nU.S. stocks plunged in volatile trade on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 posting its biggest daily drop in a month as investors were rattled by Pelosi\u2019s announcement.\n\nPOLITICAL RISK\n\nBiden said he would back impeachment if the president did not fully comply with congressional investigations.\n\n\u201cIf we allow a president to get away with shredding the Constitution, that will last forever,\u201d Biden told reporters in Wilmington, in his home state of Delaware.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump attends a bilateral meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York City, New York, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nMost Democratic presidential contenders support an impeachment inquiry, including U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar; former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.\n\nBut the move carries a risk of backfiring on Democrats if voters believe they are overreaching, as it did on House Republicans who unexpectedly lost seats in the 1998 elections after pursuing impeachment against Clinton.\n\nTrump has proven particularly resilient since taking office in January 2017, withstanding repeated scandals and retaining strong support from Republicans.\n\nHe promised to release a \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted\u201d transcript of the July 25 Ukraine call on Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats are also seeking the original complaint about Trump\u2019s call, filed by a whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community, as well as information on deliberations over the Ukrainian aid.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said his panel was communicating with an attorney representing the whistleblower and that the individual would like to testify this week.\n\nThe White House had refused to hand over the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to Congress. But an administration official said late on Tuesday it was now preparing to release it by the end of the week and most likely allow the whistleblower to meet with congressional investigators.\n\nThe Senate approved a resolution on Tuesday calling for the complaint to be submitted to the Senate and House Intelligence committees. The House will vote on a similar resolution on Wednesday.\n\nTrump said the transcript would show the Ukraine call was \u201ctotally appropriate,\u201d that he had not pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and that there had been no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for U.S. aid in exchange for a probe. Quid pro quo is a Latin phrase meaning a favour that is exchanged for a favour.\n\nTrump has produced no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\n\u201cWhen you see the readout of the call, which I assume you\u2019ll see at some point, you\u2019ll understand. That call was perfect. It couldn\u2019t have been nicer,\u201d Trump told reporters at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nTrump indicated there was nothing sinister about withholding the aid to Ukraine but he wanted Europe and not just the United States to step up and provide Ukraine assistance.\n\nThe money was later released by the Trump administration. Trump told reporters he had wanted the money for Ukraine frozen, but changed his mind after \u201cpeople called me.\u201d", "description": "Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday launched a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, accusing him of seeking foreign help to smear Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of next year's election.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433423225&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1OY", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
