This slow-frying transforms the spinach into a rich and flavorful version of itself. Here, the spinach isn't fried in so much oil, or for as long, but it still delivers a uniquely rich and wholly unexpected depth to the dish. The spinach stew can be made ahead of time but, if you do so, season the fish and chickpeas close to the time when you are going to cook them. The Persian lime powder is optional. You can buy it, or start with a whole dried Persian lime: Roughly crush it with the side of a knife and then grind to a fine powder in a spice grinder.\n\nFeatured in: Yet Another Way To Eat Your Spinach.", "description": "This highly aromatic dish is inspired by pkaila,\u00a0a Tunisian condiment made by frying spinach in plenty of oil for a long time (traditionally hours) until it becomes almost black in color This slow-frying transforms the spinach into a rich and flavorful version of itself Here, the spinach isn't fried in so much oil, or for as long, but it still delivers a uniquely rich and wholly unexpected depth to the dish", "authors": ["Yotam Ottolenghi", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Melissa Clark", "Tejal Rao", "Florence Fabricant", "Alex Witchel", "Sam Sifton", "Colu Henry", "Ali Slagle"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/12/dining/12Ottorex1/12Ottorex1-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-12"}
