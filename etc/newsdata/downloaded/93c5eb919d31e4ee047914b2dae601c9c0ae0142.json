Wander through the island and you'll find hundreds of dolls with missing limbs, heads, or just generally looking like something straight out of a horror film.\n\n(Image: isladelasmunecas.com)\n\nIn fact, he began devoting his life to honouring the lost soul, hanging up hundreds of dolls which he found from the canals and trash from other areas (without cleaning them up).\n\nThe result is a bizarre, somewhat terrifying island filled with mutilated dolls missing limbs, eyes, heads and looking worse for wear.\n\n(Image: isladelasmunecas.com)\n\nTo add to all of the spookiness, there have been reports that the dolls whisper to each other (listen carefully to see if you can hear it), and even been seen to move their heads and arms, or in some instances open their eyes.\n\nBasically, it's not one for the faint-hearted.\n\n(Image: isladelasmunecas.com)\n\nLa Isla de las Mu\u00f1eca was never intended to be a tourist destination.\n\nHowever, the creepy legend and the dolls became a draw for ghost-hunters, and the island even began to feature on a host of TV shows around the paranormal, thrusting it into the spotlight.\n\n(Image: Cordelia Persen/Flickr)\n\nThe small island first opened to visitors in 2001, and has quickly become a firm favourite, especially amongst those looking for unusual day trips from Mexico City.\n\nIf you want to visit, you can find boats from Embarcadero Cuemanco or Embarcadero Fernando Celada.\n\n(Image: Derek Simeone/Flickr)\n\nAlternatively, you can opted for a private boat trip to be negotiated with locals but do your research before you book - there have been reports of some scams which take you to a fake island with dolls.\n\nIt will take approximately three to four hours to visit, especially if you're planning on exploring the canals as well.\n\nMost people visit the island during the day but you can also visit during the night although there aren't any official overnight stays - we imagine you wouldn't sleep easy anyway!", "description": "Mexico's Island of Nightmares is filled with mutilated dolls and was never intended to be a tourist destination", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Kevin Flickr", "Isladelasmunecas.Com", "Cordelia Persen Flickr", "Derek Simeone Flickr"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14218370.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Island-of-Dolls.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-01"}
