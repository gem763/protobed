It was a gift to Russia, a gift to Iran, a gift to ISIS (Islamic State) and a gift to (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad,\u201d said Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who sponsored the resolution.\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, congressional and committee leaders from both parties were meeting with Trump at the White House to discuss his Syria policy.\n\nThe resolution backed by the House opposes Trump\u2019s decision to remove the troops and calls on the his administration to present a \u201cclear and specific plan for the enduring defeat of ISIS (Islamic State).\n\nIt also calls on Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to immediately end the offensive, seeks continued U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish communities through humanitarian support and also calls on the United States to work to ensure that Turkey\u2019s military acts with restraint.\n\nA companion resolution, also backed by Democrats and Republicans, was introduced in the Republican-majority Senate on Tuesday, but has not yet been brought up for a vote.", "description": "The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to condemn President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria, clearing the way for Turkey's offensive against U.S.-allied Syrian Kurds.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
