And this time? It\u2019s political! On Wednesday evening, Time released a photo of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface makeup to an event in 2001. Trudeau, 29 at the time the photo was taken, was attending an \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 themed gala benefitting West Point Grey Academy, the private school at which he taught. The photo of Trudeau was published in the 2000-2001 edition of West Point Grey Academy\u2019s yearbook.\n\nA spokesperson for Canada\u2019s Liberal Party confirmed that it was, in fact, Trudeau in the photo, saying, \u201cHe attended with friends and colleagues dressed as a character from Aladdin.\u201d In the photo, Trudeau is smiling directly at the camera while decked out in brown-face, robes, and a turban. No one else in the photo appears to have darkened their skin for the event.\n\nLet this unfortunate incident serve as a salient reminder while you pick out your Halloween costume that brown or black face is never okay under any circumstances. Never. Ever. Okay. Sigh, can you believe it\u2019s only Wednesday?", "description": "A photo has surfaced of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface at an \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019 themed gala in 2001.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/justin_trudeau.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
