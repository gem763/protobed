Very weird??? X factor seems to be on the way out... terrible TV.\"\n\nNow he is getting ready to take to the stage and will hope his comments don't get dragged up by the judges.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSimon Cowell thinks the new-look show should win people over.\n\nHe said: \"I think change in any aspect is good, but I was saying to someone the other day, 'I've signed Westlife, I've signed Five, Il Divo, One Direction, Little Mix. They're all groups, but they're all different'.\n\n\"Sometimes you've got to take a break of at least a year, two years, between signing one kind of group and then launching another.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"It's the same with The X Factor . You can't just keep making the same show that it was 14 years ago and expect it to be the same show today.\n\n\"You've got to take a step back for a little while.\"\n\nCowell also revealed that he kept himself in the dark about the line-up until the night of the performances.\n\nHe said: \"It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version. The only condition was I couldn't know who was going to be on it.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"I said to the team, 'You've got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don't do that it won't work.'\n\n\"So, that was the deal and we stuck to it. I swear to God I didn't have a clue who any of the acts were.\n\n\"I did walk away thinking, 'If we're smart, we have artists here who could actually sell records off the back of this'. So, I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.\"'\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
