Ante is getting all the assistance and all the support he can from us. We see how diligently he and his coaching team are working. And we see the progress,\u201d Preetz said.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s about the team getting reward and points for the efforts being made. We\u2019re not mistaking the situation, but there\u2019s enough time and there are enough games to turn the negative situation around,\u201d he said.\n\nHertha\u2019s travails are being amplified by city rival Union Berlin\u2019s encouraging Bundesliga debut. Union defeated Borussia Dortmund 3-1 before going down 2-1 to Werder Bremen at home. Union fans cheered when they heard of Hertha\u2019s defeat after their own to Bremen on Saturday.\n\nSpurred by Union\u2019s first ever promotion, Hertha\u2019s marketing department has been pushing the notion of Hertha being the main club in Berlin - and not just for the west of the city, where it is based. Beer jugs at games sport the names of all the city\u2019s boroughs, including Treptow-K\u00f6penick, where Union is based.\n\n\u201cHertha is the capital club, the No. 1 in Berlin,\u201d Covic said before the season started.\n\nHe has five league games to turn his side\u2019s fortunes around before Hertha visits Union\u2019s ground in K\u00f6penick for their first top-flight derby on Nov. 2.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S BUNDESLIGA\n\nBayern Munich\u2019s women\u2019s team lost 2-1 to visiting Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday.\n\nBayern defender Kathrin Hendrich canceled out Henrietta Csiszar\u2019s opener for the visitors, but Milena Nikolic struck back a minute later.\n\nLeverkusen held on despite a host of chances for Bayern.\n\nDefending champion Wolfsburg remains the only team with a perfect record after three games. It defeated Hoffenheim 3-0 at home on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hertha Berlin's fresh start under a new coach and the additional millions provided by a new backer is not going to plan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/germany_soccer_weekened_watch_55671_c0-167-3989-2492_s1770x1032.jpg?c4e3d76a05a201c05a0493d9fdf678618d887ec5", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
