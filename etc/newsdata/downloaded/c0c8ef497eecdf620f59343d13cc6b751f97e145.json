Most attendants do not know the price, and those who are empty-handed just get waved through having paid nothing at all.\n\n\u201cYou can pay with a cigarette,\u201d Orlando Molina, told the agency while filling up his subcompact Ford Ka in Caracas. \u201cHeck, it\u2019s no secret to anyone that it goes for nothing.\u201d\n\nThe government has long subsidized gasoline since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez came to power in 1998 as an integral part of his socialist revolution. Yet despite the stratospheric levels of hyperinflation, the Maduro regime has refused to raise prices, meaning that the cost of filling up a tank is equivalent to just a fraction of a cent.\n\nOne Caracas resident, identified as Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez, told the agency that many customers would happily pay more for gas if the government would use the proceeds to invest in improving road safety. \u201cOur roads are unbearable,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere are huge holes \u2014 craters \u2014 that not only damage our cars but also put our own lives at risk.\u201d\n\nMaduro has acknowledged that the state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA) runs a deficit of billion dollars a year because of the enormous discrepancy between the cost of gasoline and the costs of production.\n\nThe low cost of fuel is helped by the fact that Venezuela sits upon the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, although that has not prevented widespread shortages of gasoline, with oil production last year falling to under one million barrels a day, a thirty-year low. As a result, the country is currently importing around 300,000 barrels of oil a day to help ease domestic fuel shortages.\n\nFollowing Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s election in 1998, production was around 3.2 million barrels a day. Most analysts attribute the collapse in production to the Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro regime\u2019s mismanagement of the once-thriving entity, which led to chronic inefficiencies and a mass walkout of employees and directors, whose experience was vital to the company\u2019s success.\n\nFuel shortages have consequently become commonplace, with reports of people queuing for days to access gasoline and the military imposing rationing at gas stations across the country. In June, one man was killed and another seriously injured following a violent scrap for gasoline at a service station in the state of M\u00e9rida. The shortages have not affected the Caracas metro area, with the Maduro regime prioritizing supplies to the capital in an attempt to alleviate pressure within the city most important to his regime\u2019s survival.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Motorists in Venezuela have started paying for gasoline with items such as rice and cigarettes due to the worthlessness of the currency.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1169577833-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
