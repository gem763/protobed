They offer instant results \u2014 increased luminosity, brightness, and smoothness, for instance \u2014 and an unmatched clean, silky-soft feeling that\u2019s slightly addicting. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, the way they work is by physically exfoliating dead skin with tiny granules (much like sandpaper would polish a piece of wood), or, in more scientific terms, \u201cthrough physical debridement,\u201d explains San Diego\u2013based dermatologist, cosmetic surgeon, and assistant clinical professor at UCSD Dr. Melanie Palm. \u201cThey mechanically remove dead cells by rolling particles to lift them off.\u201d\n\nExfoliation is important if you want your skin to look great, as dead skin cells tend to gather on the surface as we get older, leading to dullness, flakes, breakouts, and uneven texture. \u201cExfoliating speeds up the process of shedding dead cells and loosens keratin plugs so that new, healthy skin cells can replace them,\u201d explains Dr. Deanne Mraz Robinson, a dermatologist in Westport, Connecticut, and co-founder of Modern Dermatology. \u201cIt also helps prevent clogged pores, milia, blackheads, and whiteheads.\u201d More good things: The act of scrubbing boosts circulation for a post-run-esque glow, makes your makeup go on better (since your skin is more even after), and \u2014 in addition to getting rid of dead skin cells \u2014 buffs away any remaining gunk or sunscreen that your cleanser leaves behind.\n\nWhat to look for in a quality scrub? Perfectly spherical beads (ideal because they\u2019re less likely to micro-tear and scratch skin) as well as soothing ingredients like oatmeal and jojoba, says Joanna Czech, a celebrity facialist in New York and Dallas. Robinson and Palm also like the addition of chemical exfoliants like lactic acid and fruit enzymes for a two-pronged approach. A good place to start: our expert-approved picks, below.\n\nThe Best Overall Scrub\n\nDermalogica Daily Microfoliant Two dermatologists we interviewed recommended Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, a rice-based powder that you mix with water to form a paste and blends both physical and chemical exfoliation, as the best scrub in the biz. \u201cRice powder is among the most gentle manual exfoliators used in skincare products, while enzymes like papain dissolve connections between dead cells on the surface of the skin,\u201d explains Dr. Joshua Zeichner, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cThe formula also brightens with phytic acid, white tea, and licorice extract, while protecting and maintaining healthy skin-barrier function with colloidal oatmeal and allantoin.\u201d Robinson especially loves the formula for irritable skin types, which are typically asked to avoid scrubs. \u201cIt\u2019s important to not be too rough on skin that is already inflamed with acne, rosacea, or eczema, so I love that because you activate it with water you can customize the concentration you\u2019re using based on how your skin is doing.\u201d She also notes that because it\u2019s so easy on skin it\u2019s a safe one to use on a daily basis. $59 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe Best Splurge-Worthy Scrub\n\nValmont Face Exfoliant In a business where your job is to know the best skin-care products, product loyalty can be rare, but Danuta Mieloch, an esthetician and owner of New York and Philadelphia\u2019s Rescue Spa, has been using Valmont\u2019s Face Exfoliant for years. \u201cThe ultra-creamy texture and micro quartz particles make it the perfect scrub for everyone,\u201d she says, adding that you can mix it with your cleanser or a drop of micellar water to create a polish (and perhaps make it last longer since it\u2019s whopping $95 per 1.7-ounce jar). The high-end scrub also got facialist and founder of La Suite Skincare (which has locations in Greenwich, Connecticut and New York City) Rhea Souhleris\u2019s vote, who calls the texture \u201celegant\u201d and appreciates the rose-infused \u201cdistinct Valmont aroma.\u201d $95 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub for Oily and Acne-Prone Skin\n\nSkinMedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser Palm isn\u2019t a fan of harsh scrubs, so likes SkinMedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser because it blends light physical exfoliation, via super gentle jojoba beads, with chemical exfoliation (a process that breaks down the bonds between dead skin cells so they slough away). \u201cIt contains several forms of alpha hydroxy acids, including glycolic, lactic, and malic,\u201d she says, as well as breakout-busting salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid \u201cthat is attracted to the hair follicle-oil gland unit, where acne starts\u201d and helps keep pores clear. What\u2019s more, the inclusion of chemical exfoliants allows products to \u201cinteract with more metabolically active layers of skin, increasing their effectiveness,\u201d she says. In other words, you\u2019re more likely to get your money\u2019s worth out of your fancy serums and creams after using it. $47 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe Best Fragrance-Free Scrub\n\nDr. Barbara Sturm Facial Scrub According to Czech, \u201cthe best scrubs are ones that aren\u2019t too harsh and leave skin soft and clean without causing any micro-tears.\u201d That means choosing options with round granules and avoiding unevenly-shaped particles like \u201cground-up shells, fruit pits, and volcanic rocks.\u201d One of her go-to\u2019s is the refreshingly unscented Dr. Barbara Sturm Facial Scrub. Its impressive ingredient list includes purslane, an ingredient that she says \u201cstimulates the production of collagen and helps to calm inflammation,\u201d along with vitamin A, \u201cwhich promotes cell regrowth and keeps skin firm and healthy.\u201d Got sensitive skin? Spot-treat with your scrub, she advises, focusing on dry, dehydrated patches instead of using it all over your face. $70 at Goop Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub for Congested Pores\n\nDr. Brandt Microdermabrasion Skin Exfoliant Robinson\u2019s top tips for using face scrubs: Scrub with gentle pressure and \u201cwash your face first to remove makeup, oil, and dirt,\u201d she says. \u201cThat way, as you open the pores and expose new skin, it\u2019s clean.\u201d One of her favorites is the extra-scrubby Dr. Brandt Skincare Microdermabrasion Skin Exfoliant, an at-home version of a microdermabrasion treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s great for people who wear a lot of makeup and athletes that often have sweat on their skin,\u201d she says. \u2018The aluminum oxide crystals exfoliate, lactic acid softens, and a blend of chamomile, jojoba, and aloe-vera calm.\u201d $79 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub for Dry Skin\n\nTULA So Polished Exfoliating Sugar Scrub Tula So Polished Exfoliating Sugar Scrub is another one of Robinson\u2019s picks and \u201cuses sugar granule in tandem with fruit enzymes of papaya and pineapple to chemically exfoliate skin.\u201d She adds that it won\u2019t leave your face feeling stripped or tight and also has probiotics, which soothe and hydrate skin. $32 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub for Polishing Skin\n\nKarin Herzog Mild Scrub Swiss oxygen-based brand Karin Herzog\u2019s Mild Scrub\u2019s key exfoliating ingredient is one you won\u2019t find anywhere else on this list: ground white marble (chic!). \u201cThe marble is crushed in perfectly spherical granules so it\u2019s effective, gentle, and never abrasive,\u201d Mieloch, who selected the product, says, adding it should applied in upward, circular movements. \u201cIt\u2019s tried and true and gets the job done for all skin types, especially those with texture concerns. Nothing improves skin texture better than a scrub.\u201d $50 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub-Mask Hybrid\n\nDefenAge 2-Minute Reveal Masque DefenAge 2-Minute Reveal Masque is both a warming face mask and scrub and combines sugar crystals with chemically exfoliating fruit enzymes (a blend of papaya, pumpkin, and pomegranate). It received a vote from Souhleris, who likes the fact that the sugar crystals \u201cmelt when you add water, making the exfoliation process friendly to sensitive skin.\u201d Because it\u2019s a fragrance-free option, she notes her male clients especially dig it. $55 at Lovely Skin Buy\n\nThe Best Vegan Scrub\n\nAcure Brightening Facial Scrub Acure Brightening Facial Scrub, a Palm recommendation, is vegan and also free of controversial ingredients like sulfates, parabens, and mineral oil. She loves that it has sea kelp, an antioxidant that tones down inflammation, and green clay to help detoxify skin. And she isn\u2019t the only one: There are over 1,800 five-star Amazon reviews for the exfoliator. $10 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub for Brightening\n\nObagi Professional-C Microdermabrasion Polish + Mask Vitamin C is a proven antioxidant and skin brightener and Souhleris says the Obagi Professional-C Microdermabrasion Polish + Mask contains an \u201cunparalleled\u201d amount of it. \u201cI love scrubs with multitasking technologies,\u201d she says. \u201cObagi\u2019s works by exfoliating while simultaneously enhancing vitamin C bioavailability, transforming skin from dull to smooth and radiant.\u201d $69 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub for Men\n\nMalin + Goetz Jojoba Face Scrub The creamy Malin + Goetz Jojoba Face Scrub sloughs off skin with a blend of jojoba meal and biodegradable polylactic acid, contains soothing cilantro and amino acids, and is a good option for men, Czech says. She recommends it to her clients as a gentle pick to use before shaving. $40 at Bloomingdale\u2019s Buy\n\nThe Best Scrub for Sensitive Skin\n\nSakura Silk Exfoliating Gel Gommages are a little more time consuming and act differently than other scrubs. Instead of working them in to wet skin like a cleanser, you apply them to dry skin, let them set, then rub, so that \u201cdead skin cells pill into little balls that can be washed off,\u201d Palm explains. Her favorite is Sakura Silk Exfoliating Gel, a Japanese product that, according to the brand\u2019s website, contains a \u201cK-Link\u201d complex to \u201cadhere to and react with protein on the epidermis to remove dead cells on contact.\u201d She says it\u2019s ideal for all skin types, but especially those with sensitive skin or those recovering from laser treatments who wouldn\u2019t want a true scrub. \u201cI love using it at night to thoroughly yet gently remove dirt, dead skin, and environmental pollutants.\u201d $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
