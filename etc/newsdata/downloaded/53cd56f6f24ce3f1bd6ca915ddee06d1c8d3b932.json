USA TODAY\n\nARLINGTON, Texas - Maybe Matt LaFleur\u2019s offense just needed a little time.\n\nAfter a shaky, shaky start on that side of the ball in his first three games as Green Bay Packers coach, LaFleur\u2019s scheme and pairing with Aaron Rodgers is starting to show it has a high ceiling.\n\nThe last two weeks it has put up 68 points and 826 yards combined against two teams that are likely to be playoff contenders, the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe surprise is it came through as big as it did in the Packers\u2019 34-24 win over the Cowboys despite playing without the injured Davante Adams.\n\nThe Packers hired LaFleur last January in large part to rejuvenate Rodgers and restore the juice in a Packers\u2019 offense that had grown stale the last few years.\n\nCommon sense said there would be rough patches for the first month or so of the season as LaFleur acclimated to his players, and they acclimated to his scheme.\n\nStill, there was no knowing whether those early-season issues would last and perhaps reveal deeper issues within this team. They didn\u2019t. Not that we can proclaim that these Packers have arrived. It takes more than a couple good games to say that.\n\nBut in back-to-back weeks they\u2019ve moved the ball and put up points against apparently good teams, and more importantly, in Dallas on Sunday Rodgers looked like an MVP candidate even if his mediocre passer rating (85.2) suggested otherwise.\n\nGreen Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers (12) throws an incomplete pass under pressure from Dallas Cowboys defensive end Demarcus Lawrence, rear, during the first half of an NFL football game in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.

I\u2019ve accomplished a lot statistically in this league. I just want to win now.\u201d\n\nThis is the Rodgers the Packers need if they\u2019re going to accomplish something meaningful this season. He made a few good throws from inside and outside the pocket. He turned a couple possible sacks into positive plays with back-handed and left-handed flips, and awkward arm-angle throws. And he didn\u2019t turn the ball over.\n\nWhile the numbers were bland (238 yards passing, no touchdowns), the results were anything but.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really, really good at that stuff,\u201d LaFleur said of Rodgers\u2019 playmaking. \u201cHe\u2019s just a great quarterback.\u201d\n\nLaFleur has to be equally heartened that his running game finally showed life. After four bad games on the ground, Aaron Jones exploded Sunday (107 yards rushing, 75 yards receiving) and outperformed the NFL\u2019s highest-paid running back, Ezekiel Elliott (62 and 29).\n\nThe thing was, Jones did most of his damage with the inside zone run, rather than the outside zone that is the usual starting point of the Shanahan/McVay/LaFleur offense. Time after time, Jones made sharp, decisive, explosive cuts against the grain just after taking the handoff as he gashed the Cowboys for an average of 5.6 yards a carry and four touchdowns. It should have been five scores, but LaFleur flinched after Jones failed to score on first-and-goal from the 1 in the second quarter. That trip, like the first-and-goal-from-the-1 debacle last week against the Eagles, ended without a touchdown.\n\nThis was the dynamic Jones we\u2019ve seen enough of the past two years to know he\u2019s for real. But the question is whether he can do what he failed to his first two seasons: stay healthy and on the field. If he\u2019s still doing this in December, the Packers might have something going, though if they ride him every week like they did in this game (26 touches), the chances of him still standing then aren\u2019t good.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very explosive guy,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\nThe Packers came into this matchup as 3\u00bd-point underdogs, and really, that felt light considering how important Adams was to their offense against the Eagles (10 catches) before turf toe knocked him from that game late. Sure, the Cowboys were missing their two-time first-team All-Pro left tackle (Tyron Smith), but surely the Packers\u2019 loss of Adams was bigger, right?\n\nOr not.\n\nThe Packers\u2019 Smiths (Za\u2019Darius and Preston) took full advantage of Smith\u2019s replacement (Cameron Fleming) and combined for three sacks and three other hits on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who threw three interceptions.\n\nWith the way the Packers moved the ball up and down the field against the Cowboys with Jones\u2019 running and Rodgers\u2019 slinging, it was hard to notice Adams wasn\u2019t there.\n\nOf course, the Packers are going to need Adams if they\u2019re to turn this surprising 4-1 start into something worth talking about in a couple months.\n\nBut to do what they did without him in a hostile environment was no small feat. It doesn\u2019t make a season, but it makes for an interesting start.", "description": "Aaron Jones exploded Sunday (107 yards rushing, 75 yards receiving) and outperformed the NFL\u2019s highest-paid running back, Ezekiel Elliott.", "authors": ["Pete Dougherty", "Published A.M.
