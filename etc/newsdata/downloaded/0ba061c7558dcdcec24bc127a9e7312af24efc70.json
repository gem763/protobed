Empowering Medicare to negotiate prices is a nonstarter for most Republicans, even if Trump in the past backed the idea. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is advancing a bill that stops short of allowing Medicare to negotiate but incorporates other major ideas in Pelosi\u2019s plan.\n\nThe leaked draft \u201cwould please a majority of Democrats in the House, (but) it is clearly not designed to appeal to Republicans or to the Senate,\u201d said John Rother, president of the National Coalition on Health Care, an umbrella group that represents a broad cross-section of consumer and health care industry organizations. \u201cThis plan gives the Democrats a strong message platform going into the election year.\u201d\n\nPelosi plans to unveil a bill that Democrats can take to the House floor, but in an evolving situation, it\u2019s unclear how closely it will track with the leaked draft. Major provisions of the draft plan include:\n\n- Authorizing Medicare to negotiate prices for the 250 costliest drugs. That includes pharmacy drugs under the popular \u201cPart D\u201d prescription benefit, along with \u201cPart B\u201d medications dispensed in doctors\u2019 offices. The maximum price would be determined using a blend of international prices, an idea similar to what the Trump administration has proposed for drugs administered in doctors\u2019 offices. Insulin prices would be subject to negotiations. Drug companies that balk at making a deal would face steep fines.\n\n- Requiring drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare if they hike their prices beyond increases in inflation. Pelosi\u2019s inflation rebates resemble a bipartisan idea from Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Their bill has already cleared a key Senate committee, but a date for floor consideration has not been set. It has Trump\u2019s support.\n\n- Limiting what seniors pay out of pocket for their medications each year. Currently there is no limit on drug copays, and the advent of drugs costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year has left some seniors saddled with bills that rival a mortgage payment. An out-of-pocket limit is also part of the Grassley-Wyden bill, and the idea has support from the Trump administration.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A draft plan from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi leaked Tuesday would overhaul how Medicare pays for prescription drugs, by negotiating prices for costly medications, curbing annual price hikes, and limiting what seniors pay out of their own pockets.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/10/pelosi_medicare_drugs_34325_c0-116-2772-1732_s1770x1032.jpg?998ff3f3989712b9da4b5b4f8e0a1919ba2c49df", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
