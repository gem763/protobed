Go figure that celebrities who made their name in comedy have less patience for \u201ccancel culture\u201d than many of their colleagues.\n\nThis is what she\u2019s mad about:\n\nPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know. https://t.co/YV4UoxrPHI \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) August 31, 2019\n\nThat smells like a call for a blacklist, something with which Hollywood has some experience and which has new currency on the left in the age of Resistance. Arguably Messing\u2019s impulse is less obnoxious than what Joaquin Castro did to Trump donors in San Antonio for the simple reason that anyone who can afford to attend a presidential fundraiser in Beverly Hills can afford private security and a few lost job opportunities. But the point of both efforts is the same \u2014 making support for Trump a sanctionable offense, whether professionally or personally in the form of harassment by fringey wackjobs.\n\nAnd one could argue that what Messing is doing is worse. The info on Trump donors posted by Castro was publicly available in FEC reports. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much of a defense to the charge of \u201cdoxxing\u201d since the intent behind curating and amplifying the list of donors to cause them grief is the same as it is in true doxxing, but the fact remains that the info is out there and accessible. The fundraiser is a private affair. If the attendees don\u2019t want their participation to be publicly known, what\u2019s the ethical reason to reveal it? Is it a matter of such burning public interest that it qualifies as \u201cnews\u201d if Adam Sandler, say, shows up to give Trump a check? Are there complete lists available of the attendees at every Democratic presidential fundraising event this year?\n\nI don\u2019t recall there being a clamor for that information to be revealed.\n\nOne point to counter Whoopi, though. The public *should* know when a donor contributes so lavishly to a top official\u2019s campaign (or to associated Super PACs) that he or she is conceivably buying influence over policy, no? One of the egregious things about Castro\u2019s quasi-doxxing effort was that it roped in people who had given nothing more than a few thousand dollars to the Trump campaign. They were \u201cmaxxed out\u201d donors, but no one\u2019s setting pharma policy based on what a retiree who cut Trump a check for $2,800 thinks about the issue. Those people have no influence. A Charles Koch or George Soros who can plow tens of millions into a politician\u2019s operation really does move the needle potentially on what the U.S. government does with policy, though. How much dough should a private citizen have to donate before his or her interest in privacy is outweighed by the public\u2019s interest in knowing who\u2019s buying and selling its leaders? The San Antonio \u201cmaxxed out\u201d threshold is way too small. Is a Beverly Hills fundraiser also still too small? Laying aside that Messing\u2019s intimation of a blacklist is pernicious, should the public know when six-figure checks are changing hands between citizens and politicians?", "description": "\u201cWe had something called a blacklist and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff.\u201d", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/g.jpg"}
