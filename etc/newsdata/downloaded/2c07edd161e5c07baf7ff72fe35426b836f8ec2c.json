But we don't yet know who is likely to be in Downing Street - the situation is very fluid, and that is why I've chosen to do the preparations that are within our control and we're getting on with that.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Some supporters of independence have called for a \"plan b\" for securing independence\n\nThe current UK government has repeatedly refused to countenance allowing a new independence vote, with Home Secretary Priti Patel telling the same programme that ministers were determined to \"respect the result of referendums that took place previously\".\n\nThis has led some SNP members - including MPs, MSPs and councillors - to call for a \"plan B\", such as securing a majority in an election or holding an unauthorised poll.\n\n'Doesn't end well'\n\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon ruled out such an approach, saying a legal and constitutional referendum was the only way forward.\n\nShe said: \"If I thought there was any quicker way, an easier way, a plan B that would get us there quicker, I would have taken it by now.\n\n\"What we have to do is have a process that allows us to demonstrate that there is majority support in Scotland for independence, and we have to have a process that is legal and accepted, otherwise our independence will not be recognised.\"\n\nShe added: \"It would make my life easier in the short term just to just tell my supporters what they want to hear, but I've watched Brexiteer leaders doing that over the last three years and it doesn't end well. I have to deal in reality.\n\n\"I'm determined to lead my country to independence, and that means doing it properly.\"", "description": "Nicola Sturgeon says Westminster leaders should not expect SNP backing unless they allow an independence vote.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qybyb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
