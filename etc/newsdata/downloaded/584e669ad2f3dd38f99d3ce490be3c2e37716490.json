With depressing predictability, Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic jock-duster, Lindsey Graham, called on the DOJ to investigate \u201cthe Biden-Ukraine connection.\u201d This is mendacious nonsense, but it is the political meth that powers Trump World. Expect more.\n\nThe risk for Biden is that he will be hit simultaneously from the right and the left and that the specter of scandal would erode his argument that he is the most electable Democrat.\n\nAt first, Biden seemed to worry that the story could backfire on him, a narrative that some of his progressive critics are more than happy to push. He had a chance to hit back hard, but as Politico noted, he first remarks were \u201ccircumspect and measured.\u201d\n\nThis is, of course, exactly the wrong way to respond to a Trumpian smear.", "description": "", "authors": ["Charlie Sykes", "Thebulwark.Com The-Trump-Ukraine-Story-Is-A-Stress-Test"], "top_image": ""}
