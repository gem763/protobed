But his punishment was to write a four sentence letter of apology and to follow a no-contact agreement that saw Dani - not her supervisor - barred from certain university buildings.\n\nThe man was allowed to continue working at the university.\n\nThe University of Cambridge told the BBC it places the \"utmost importance\" on the welfare of its students and said improvements have, and will continue to be, made.\n\n'It will ruin you' - Alice's story\n\nAlice, not her real name, reported a student for \"stealthing\" - a term for when a condom is removed during sex without the other person knowing.\n\nThe person would \"potentially be committing rape\", lawyers say, because if you agree to having sex with a condom and remove it - without saying - then you no longer have consent.\n\nAfter seeing a complaint on social media about the same student, Alice felt she had to come forward, despite hearing \"so many horror stories\" about her university's sexual misconduct reporting process.\n\nThrough social media, she spoke to eight women who had similar experiences with the same man.\n\nA trail of emails, seen by the BBC, shows how she kept the university updated on what she found. But when Alice was waiting for a date for her preliminary hearing with the university, she was suddenly told her case was being dropped.\n\nA rule change by the university's disciplinary committee meant her case no longer fitted its definition of \"harassment\".\n\nAlice, who has now graduated, is \"terrified\" that the man remains on campus unchallenged - unless a current student decides to mount a fresh complaint under the new rules.\n\nA University of Cambridge spokesman said: \"We are doing everything we can to make sure students feel supported, and informed, regarding their choices\". But the university said there is \"always more we can do\".\n\n\"It's a total waste of time,\" Alice says. \"And it will ruin you.\"\n\nWhat happens when a student complains?\n\nEach institution is different, but normally the university appoints an investigator who takes witness statements.\n\nThen a panel, made up of academic staff and sometimes a student representative, interviews the accused and the accuser before deciding whether the complaint should be upheld.\n\nThe process is supposed to be quick, but the BBC heard from one woman whose complaint of sexual assault took nine months to resolve - the entirety of her second year.\n\nSome universities do not tell the accuser the outcome of their own complaint - viewing it as a matter between the institution and the accused.\n\nBBC research found punishments for sexual misconduct ranged from expulsion to bans from university bars. Others were told to write letters of apology to victims.\n\nAt the University of Sussex, one sanction for sexual misconduct was a suspended \u00a3250 fine, only payable if the student got into trouble again before the end of that year.\n\nAnna Bull from the 1752 group, which researches sexual misconduct in higher education, is calling for better regulation of complaints procedures.\n\n\"Universities have encouraged students to come forward and make complaints, but actually institutions are not necessarily safe to report to,\" she says.\n\nPart of the problem, she says, is that universities police themselves - and while some manage this well, many do not.\n\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, England's independent regulator of higher education, told the BBC it would intervene in \"serious examples of universities failing to address these issues seriously\".\n\n\"But we will always be focused on making sure that our intervention is appropriate and in the best interest of students. It's not about punishing universities,\" she said.\n\nUniversities UK, which represents higher education institutions, urged universities to follow its voluntary guidelines.\n\nListen to the File on 4 documentary on BBC Sounds.\n\nAdditional reporting by Larissa Kennelly", "description": "Dozens of students say they were \"traumatised\" by investigations that left them feeling unsafe on campus.", "authors": ["Dulcie Lee", "Kate West", "Bbc News", "File On"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5797/production/_108832422_adc9adc3-ee82-4dff-a492-2c03b9a83501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
