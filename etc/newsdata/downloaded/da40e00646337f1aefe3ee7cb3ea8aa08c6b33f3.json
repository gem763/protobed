At last Thursday\u2019s debate in Houston, candidates offered hopeful, optimistic appeals for national unity\u2014along with ferocious attacks on President Trump. Some even added denunciations of America. In combination, the effect was jarring.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris was a prime example. She said, \u201cThe vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we\u2019re registered.\u201d She promised to focus \u201con our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country.\u201d\n\nThis was shortly after she accused Mr. Trump of having \u201cspent the last 2\u00bd years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us.\u201d She accused him of using \u201chate, intimidation, fear and over 12,000 lies\u201d to distract from his policies. She also held the president responsible for the El Paso massacre: \u201cHe didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.\u201d\n\nFormer Texas representative and skateboarder Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke offered a similar mixture of aspirational rhetoric and vicious personal attacks. He first complained about \u201cthe bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment\u201d in which America finds itself, saying, \u201cWe have to be bigger.\u201d\n\nThen he decried \u201chow dangerous Donald Trump is\u201d and blamed him for El Paso, saying the shooter was \u201cinspired to kill by our president.\u201d He then went further, declaring \u201cwe have a white supremacist in the White House,\u201d who \u201cposes a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.\u201d Is that supposed to be \u201cbigger\u201d and rising above \u201cbitterness\u201d and \u201cpettiness?\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker followed suit, recalling a mentor who challenged him to realize that \u201cif you\u2019re stubborn and defiant and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.\u201d Of course Mr. Booker also called Mr. Trump \u201ca racist,\u201d and said America suffered from \u201csystematic racism that is eroding our nation.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to unite a country while also accusing it of being led and dominated by white bigots.\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg also crossed his campaign\u2019s streams. He proclaimed that \u201cwe need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we\u2019ve ever seen\u201d and recalled 9/11 as \u201ca moment we came together as a country.\u201d But rather than merely attack Mr. Trump, Mr. Buttigieg also went after President Barack Obama, saying \u201cDemocrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths\u201d and were responsible for \u201cdeporting people, hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone, who posed no threat.\u201d This support for open borders\u2014echoed by other debate participants\u2014will hardly bring the country together behind the Democrats in 2020.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren struck an uplifting note: \u201cI know what\u2019s broken, I know how to fix it, and I\u2019m going to lead the fight to get it done.\u201d But while she shunned assaulting Mr. Trump, she targeted \u201ca corrupt political system\u201d run by the rich and powerful that left \u201cthe drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil-fuel industry determining what\u2019s happening in Washington.\u201d So it\u2019s either her or the forces of darkness. Got it.\n\nAs the grumpy Vermonter is wont to do, Sen. Bernie Sanders dispensed with a positive vision altogether and focused on painting a relentlessly grim picture of America, calling Mr. Trump \u201cthe most dangerous president\u201d in history and bashing the U.S. as an \u201coligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control . . . economic and political life.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was the lone exception. He maintained the most consistently positive tone, saying of Americans that \u201cthere has never been a single solitary time when we\u2019ve set our mind to something we\u2019ve been unable to do it. We\u2019re walking around with our heads down like woe is me. We\u2019re the best-equipped nation in the world to take this on. . . . We should get moving.\u201d But the negativity of nine others on the stage overwhelmed his message.\n\nWhatever good Democrats did their collective cause by striking grace notes was swamped by their harsh personal attacks on the president and over-the-top criticisms of America. These assaults may enthuse the hard-core Democrats, but they will leave skeptical voters in the middle unmoved while pulling all the party\u2019s candidates further left.\n\nNone of this helps Democrats, but we\u2019ll see more of it, since this is what that party\u2019s inflamed base demands. With nine more intraparty presidential debates to go\u2014three this year and six next\u2014Democrats are digging themselves a hole that will be difficult to escape.\n\nMr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is author of \u201cThe Triumph of William McKinley \u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2015).", "description": "At the Democratic debate, candidates decried divisiveness while sowing division.", "authors": ["Karl Rove"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108363/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
