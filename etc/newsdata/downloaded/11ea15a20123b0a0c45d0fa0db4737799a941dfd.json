But I will promise you that those that leave us will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness.\"\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Image caption New York-based WeWork has more than 500 locations around the world\n\nWeWork, which rents office space on flexible terms to companies and freelancers, grew rapidly from its founding in New York City in 2010 to more than 500 locations around the world.\n\nFor years, the focus on growth overrode concerns about profitability and led the company to experiment beyond office rentals, opening apartments and schools. Those businesses are among the units expected to be sold.\n\nWeWork is also likely to focus on the US, Europe and Japan, pulling back from regions that include China and much of Latin America, the Financial Times reported.\n\n\"To be candid, what we are lacking is focus on our core business,\" Mr Claure wrote.\n\n\"The past two months have been challenging, and I am not going to minimize those challenges,\" he wrote. \"Fortunately, we have all the necessary ingredients to make this one of the most amazing comeback stories ever, and prove our detractors wrong.\"", "description": "The firm's new executive chairman says it must 'right-size' the business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14036/production/_109347918_gettyimages-1135392471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
