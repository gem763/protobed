In fact, this isn\u2019t about states\u2019 rights at all.\n\nWe all know that it\u2019s impractical for automakers to comply with 50 different sets of environmental regulations, so Congress set a national standard. Congress gave my former home state of California an exception because of the state\u2019s severe smog problem, which was described as a \u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d conditions. I\u2019d say. In some places, it was hard to see your hand in front of your face.\n\nBut give California an inch, it\u2019ll take a mile. And that\u2019s exactly what it did with this waiver. Instead of using the exemption to curtail smog, California used the waiver to push its super liberal environmental agenda down the throats of all Californians. The state\u2019s greenhouse-gas rules are meant to solve the \u201cclimate change\u201d crisis, not deal with smog.\n\nFine. People who live in California know what they\u2019re getting into. That\u2019s why my family and I got out of there, along with thousands of others who are participating in the great outward migration.\n\nBut during Barack Obama\u2019s administration, California leveraged its size and power to influence the nationwide regulations. That meant that car prices went up and manufacturers sold Texans and Mississippians cars that met the California standards \u2014 whether they believed in the hocus pocus global warming or not.\n\nSomeone needs to show California the map so it can learn that the whole nation does not revolve around its misguided, unscientific environmental policies.\n\nCome to think of it, that\u2019s sort of what President Trump is doing.\n\nPresident Trump is right to get rid of California special waiver, but he should also do away with all of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards while he\u2019s at it. These standards, created after the 1973 Arab oil embargo caused oil prices to shoot through the roof, need to be eliminated for several reasons:\n\n1. CAFE standards kill Americans. Because these regulations focus on fuel efficiency, car manufacturers are pressured to make lighter cars by using less steel. Weight reduction is the main way that manufacturers comply with the standards, even though it\u2019s much more dangerous.\n\n2. CAFE standards haven\u2019t really reduced our dependence on oil. The truth of the matter is that manufacturers were incentivized to make more fuel-efficient cars is when high mileage imports became available. Also, when the gasoline prices were high for a long period of time, the American manufacturers invested $88 billion to make their vehicles that ran more efficiently and less expensively. This is basic supply and demand stuff. Economics 101.\n\n3. CAFE costs American jobs. CAFE regulations mean that each car costs more money than it otherwise would cost. When an item or service costs more, demand goes down. When people buy fewer cars, it costs auto manufacturers their jobs as manufacturers move their facilities overseas where labor is less expensive.\n\n4. CAFE regulations don\u2019t create the desired effect. Would it be great if everyone had a fuel-efficient car? Sure. But people can\u2019t afford to pay the higher prices for such cars, which means they keep their older, gas-guzzlers for a longer period of time. This means that there is more pollution due to misguided regs.\n\n5. CAFE regulations undermine the free market. If Congress doesn\u2019t intervene on gas prices \u2014 as it did in the 1970s \u2014 then people will have a natural incentive to use less gas. They\u2019ll seek out more efficient cars, which means that manufacturers will have a financial incentive to create them. In fact, some car manufacturers have already told the state of California that they will continue to make cars that meet their requirements, no matter what happens with the Trump administration. This is great \u2014 capitalism at work.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation summed up the issues with these regulations best. \u201cCAFE acts as a tax on larger, safer cars which is used to subsidize sales of smaller, higher-mpg, but less safe cars.\u201d\n\nDoes that make any sense to anyone at all?\n\nAs President Trump takes California\u2019s waiver away, he also has an opportunity to rectify our overall car manufacturing dysfunction.\n\nBy getting rid of the CAFE standards, the government could let the free market work, trust in capitalism and \u2014 most of all \u2014 get out of the way.\n\n\u2022 Mark Meckler (@MarkMeckler) is president of the nonprofit Citizens for Self-Governance and a co-founder of the tea party movement.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
