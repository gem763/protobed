REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo\n\nCanada\u2019s sustainable pace of economic growth, estimated by the Bank of Canada at 1.8%, is not much faster than the rate at which its population is increasing, meaning many Canadians are no better off financially.\n\n\u201cNone of the four parties as far as I\u2019ve observed have talked at all about that side of life, how you generate actual growth, how you generate wealth, how you generate income,\u201d David Dodge, senior adviser at Bennett Jones and former governor of the Bank of Canada, told Reuters.\n\nWhile the election campaign has focused on issues like cell phone bills and boutique tax credits to quell discomfort among Canadians, economists say that a long-term fix would require increased government and private investment targeted at raising productivity. Canadians vote on Oct. 21.\n\nCanada\u2019s productivity growth, which drives higher wages, has tended to be lackluster. It rose 0.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, much slower than the 1.8% gain in the United States, the country\u2019s biggest trading partner, official data showed.\n\nA survey by Sage, a cloud business management solutions company, in partnership with market research agency Angus Reid, found last Tuesday that two-thirds of Canadian business owners believe current federal government policies have not helped businesses grow.\n\nMeasures that would accelerate economic growth include more efficient allocation of government infrastructure spending, reduced duplication of federal, provincial and municipal regulation and increased spending on research and development that leads to greater innovation, according to Craig Alexander, chief economist at Deloitte Canada.\n\nJohn Pigott is CEO of Club Coffee, a Toronto-based company that he says invented the world\u2019s first compostable coffee pod. A real \u201cbugaboo\u201d on the competitiveness front, he said, is Canada\u2019s woeful ability to sustain innovation.\n\n\u201cWe have a horrendous track record of commercializing innovation,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we take a Canadian invention and make it global and get real scale?\u201d\n\nAnother challenge to Canada\u2019s competitiveness has been U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s move to slash America\u2019s corporate tax rate.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is Canadian companies and multinational companies who have operations here, are saying \u2018my next increment of productive capacity? I\u2019m investing in the (United) States\u2019,\u201d said Dennis Darby, president and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, which advocates for manufacturers.\n\nThe World Economic Forum on Wednesday said that Canada had dropped two spots in its global competitiveness rankings to 14th place, while Canada\u2019s stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) has climbed on average over the last five years at about half the annual pace of FDI to the United States, government data showed.\n\nFinancial markets have taken in stride the prospect of increased deficit spending to meet campaign promises, with investors more worried about the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute on Canada\u2019s trade-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cAs with most political choices, there is a time inconsistency problem,\u201d said Tim Alt, a portfolio manager at Aviva Investors. \u201cWhat\u2019s best for the long run, might not be best for one\u2019s political career.\u201d", "description": "Canada's political leaders should address the underlying problems limiting long-term economic growth and not just campaign on pocketbook issues ahead of the federal election this month, business leaders, economists and foreign investors say.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Fergal Smith", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440972547&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E05Q-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
