(0763.HK) was trading down 2.6% at HK$22.90 early on.\n\nThe two operators said late Monday that they will co-build one 5G access network nationwide and share 5G spectrum while independently constructing the core network.\n\nWrite to Martin Mou at martin.mou@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 09, 2019 23:18 ET (03:18 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
