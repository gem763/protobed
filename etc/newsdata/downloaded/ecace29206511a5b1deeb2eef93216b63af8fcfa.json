(AP) - Actor Judd Nelson says he doesn't share the misgivings about \"The Breakfast Club\" that co-star Molly Ringwald expressed in a first-person column.\n\nIn April 2018, Ringwald wrote a column for The New Yorker about watching the movie a few years earlier with her then 10-year-old daughter. Her discomfort focuses on interactions that her character had with a \"bad boy\" portrayed by Nelson.\n\nIn an interview with The StarNews of Wilmington , Nelson says he thinks the 1985 movie is \"a product of its time\" and that he doesn't \"see those problems that Molly sees.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old Nelson is in Wilmington to star in the play \"Love Letters,\" which will be performed Saturday at Kenan Auditorium. His co-star in the two-person drama is Sheryl Lee, who played Laura Palmer in \"Twin Peaks.\"", "description": "WILMINGTON, N.C.
