New models are showing up in showrooms, and dealers want older models out of their lots and off their balance sheets.\n\nHas anything changed? Generally, it\u2019s still the time when many manufacturers debuting their new models, but it\u2019s not cast in stone. If you have a specific model in mind, do some research to see when the new version will be debuted. It can be any time of year.\n\nIf you\u2019re leasing, don\u2019t look for big deals at model year-end. You\u2019re essentially leasing a car that is already a year old, and that lowers its value when it comes back off lease \u2014 a value determined by the leasing company. Your monthly payments will reflect that loss of value.\n\nNow is the time for those with cash in hand, and a specific vehicle in mind. According to George Iny, president of the Automobile Protection Association (APA), \u201cthe best deals for a cash or finance buyer are on a model that is being discontinued, or due for a significant redesign \u2026 large rebates of $4,000 or more are possible.\u201d His warning? Discontinued vehicles frequently depreciate more quickly after they\u2019ve been discontinued, so make sure it\u2019s a car you really like, and one you plan on keeping. He cites the recent clearance pricing on the Chevrolet Cruze as an example.\n\nA car sale is a lot like a duck: What you see on the surface can seem effortless, but there are a lot of machinations going on beneath. If dealers hit certain limits, they get bonuses and incentives a buyer doesn\u2019t see. That car loan you applied for through the dealer to buy that car? They get a piece of that, too.\n\nThis time of year, you can hammer out good deals and use that timing to your advantage. \u201cThere is a point between the end of the model year and the beginning of January, when the previous year\u2019s model loses all manufacturer supports in terms of rebates and interest rate subsidies,\u201d says Iny. The dealer is no longer seeing those bonuses and incentives on that vehicle, and really needs to move it. \u201cThe dealer is stuck with an older new vehicle that has to be retailed like a used car, without automaker support.\u201d\n\nIndustry consultant John Raymond notes that dealers \u201cfinance their inventories and pay insurance on that inventory.\u201d Every spot on the lot taken up by a car is costing them money. Turnover is healthy, and this time of year in particular, they want out with the old, in with the new. He notes banks play a role in this, too: If you\u2019ve ever wondered why you can get zero-per-cent financing on one model but not another, it\u2019s how manufacturers can influence what you purchase, but banks can also end those kinds of loans, via dealers, on models going out of date. Every incentive lost means a dealer really wants that vehicle out of inventory and off their balance sheet.\n\nIf you\u2019ve had your eye on something you know is heading to its end of the line, know that sometimes, there are models that people are chasing down. For example, according to a couple of Hyundai dealers I spoke with, the outgoing 2019 Santa Fe XL is one of them. While the incoming Palisade will replace it, the outgoing seven-seater is still popular. End of the line doesn\u2019t always mean end of the want.\n\nBe aware of an oft-used but sorta shady practice employed by some dealers: Pre-registering vehicles to show them as \u201csold\u201d to qualify them for bonuses and rebates. Says Iny, \u201cwhen this is done, the dealer has already earned an incentive (this protects them from the withdrawal of support later), but the warranty starts to run from that date.\u201d\n\nEspecially on cars about to be orphaned by manufacturers and incentives, pay attention to see if the car has been registered already. It\u2019s not inconceivable that you think your warranty should begin the date you buy the car \u2014 not months beforehand. Your warranty date should be clearly written on your bill of sale, but be sure to double check. According to Iny, manufacturers are well aware of the practice, but they juice numbers and reportable sales look stronger, so they look the other way.\n\nFinally, what about those Christmas specials? You\u2019ll start seeing suspended payments, sometimes for up to three months, along with holiday rebates as well as other incentives. Again, if it\u2019s on a vehicle you know you\u2019re interested in, there are good deals to be had. Be aware of the difference between suspended payments, though \u2014 you still owe the amount, it\u2019s just been kicked down the road \u2014 and make sure they\u2019re suspending the interest, too. A deal where they reduce the price by that amount (which should bring down taxes, too), or give you a rebate or gift card, apply it to your car loan.\n\nDo your research and ask a lot of questions.
