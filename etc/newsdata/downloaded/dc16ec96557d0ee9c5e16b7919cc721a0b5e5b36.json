So be it with this hearty novel, a hunt-board of a thriller rich in historical meat if, for my taste, too grisly by half.\n\nStudded with murders committed by a psychopathic genius with an ear fetish, the story presents a delicious cast of characters, including a who\u2019s-who in the true-to-life culture war over Charles Darwin\u2019s theory in the 1860s. The novel depicts the furor around his revolutionary book while depicting the era\u2019s grand tableaux \u2014 the monarchy of Queen Victoria, the golden age of Dickens, the dawn of Darwinism, i.e. evolutionary biology. Novelist Tim Mason serves them all.\n\nDickens himself appears and Karl Marx has a droll cameo. Sir Richard Owen, the paleontologist who coined the term Dinosauria, has a bigger part. Ditto cranky Robert FitzRoy, Darwin\u2019s erstwhile friend and captain of HMS Beagle on their epochal voyage in 1831. Thirty years later, Darwin figures here as an old man beset by illness and tragedy.\n\nSamuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, plays his pompous part as a prince of the church who condemns \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d on theological grounds, foolishly abetting the novel\u2019s murderous conspiracy. A dissenter muses, \u201cI believe he [Wilberforce] was genuinely horrified to learn that words might have consequences in \u2026 the real world.\u201d (In historical fact, the backsliding bishop is best remembered for his jibe about Thomas Huxley\u2019s simian grandparents in the faux Huxley-Wilberforce Debate.)\n\nWhile controversy over the fact of evolution seems quaint today, Darwin\u2019s thesis was incendiary when his book appeared in 1859. That some Victorians might commit murder in order to discredit the idea of \u201cthe descent of man\u201d now looks as heinous as today\u2019s xenophobes perpetrating massacres in the name of ethnic superiority. Back then the argument was whether Homo sapiens was kin to apes; today it boils down to whether people of all colors are one species.\n\nMr. Mason aptly describes the Victorian controversy and the parties to it. Prince Albert, a progressive in our terms, had triumphed with his Crystal Palace exhibition, which Tories had opposed as a magnet for thieving immigrants and an extravagant circus for hoi polloi. Here the queen\u2019s consort nominates Darwin for knighthood, but he never got it \u2014 a fact which plots are made on.\n\nAnother actual person is Chief Detective Inspector Charles Field, whom Charles Dickens befriended, shadowed in real life and channeled as the sleuth he named Bucket in \u201cBleak House.\u201d Here, from the start, Inspector Field makes canny deductions about the criminal plot that unfolds one killing at a time. If Wilkie Collins\u2019 contemporaneous novel \u201cMoonstone\u201d was the first mystery, \u201cThe Darwin Affair\u201d masquerades as the first police procedural.\n\nThe detective ponders its first four victims: \u201cThey\u2019re fair desperate to tell us how they all link up to the plot against Her Majesty the Queen.\u201d How then, a subaltern asks, is Darwin implicated? \u201cCrash, boom. Mr. Darwin brings it all down\u201d with his egalitarian biology. \u201cRule Britannia and the lot. Brings it down harder and more thorough than Mr. Marx ever dreamt in his darkest revolutionary dream.\u201d Subaltern: \u201cSo why kill the Queen? Why not kill Mr. Darwin?\u201d Inspector: \u201cI\u2019m guessing the Queen don\u2019t know Darwin from Adam\u2019s off-ox.\u201d Suffice it that in Mr. Mason\u2019s prestidigitations, red herrings upstage Galapagos finches.\n\nEvoking the sights and smells of England, the novelist catalogs the grandeur of monarchal life. The side-wheeler yacht Victoria and Albert has a crew of 240 (and 12 servants to attend the royals); The last Hanoverian palaces are chilly and candlelit to suit her parsimonious foibles. All is not brocade and bonbons: Inspector Field frequents London\u2019s funky pubs and the Thames\u2019 fetid low-tide flats, realm of scavenging \u201cmudlarks.\u201d\n\nSuffice it that the villain is a deranged anatomist and Mr. Mason assays a faceted portrait: \u201cDecimus Cobb went to the quiet place in his mind, a place where he could visualize the dissection of the man standing before him.\u201d But pure evil gets boring and the proximate cause of his pathology comes clear in an anticlimax. Yet before that Mr. Mason twists his plot deftly \u2014 certainly more tidily than Dickens did in his serial novels of twice the length. His palaces are lavish, his London fulsome, his historical characters sweet and savory.\n\n\u2022 Philip Kopper, publisher of Posterity Press Inc., in Chevy Chase, writes about history and culture.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE DARWIN AFFAIR\n\nBy Tim Mason\n\nAlgonquin, $27.95, 373 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
