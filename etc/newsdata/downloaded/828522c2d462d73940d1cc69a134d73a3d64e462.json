Daniel and Sinead's relationship has been so believable and real.\n\n'I find it quite difficult to switch off after emotional scenes, I feel so drained after a scene that's involved a lot of crying, so I guess the grieving process you see on screen will be a lot easier to play because Daniel's sad that Sinead's gone, and I'm devastated that I'm not working with Katie.'\n\nKatie was focused on ensuring their portrayal of the storyline felt real to viewers. She said: 'I spoke with Pete at Mummy's Star and asked him how it was for him towards the end.\n\n'Daniel's story is very similar to what happened to Pete and he was very honest with me about his relationship with his wife towards the end of her life. He said they argued, they laughed and cried and he's helped me bit by bit through the whole story.\n\n'I've also had medical advisers on set helping with the stage of physicality she's up to with her illness. Everyone has been really helpful.\n\n'When we filmed our last scenes it felt real. I know what a terrific actor Rob is and how he's going to play the next part of this story without me, and I just feel sorry for Daniel's character.\n\n'It's going to be the end of an era because I've really enjoyed working with him.'\n\nDevastating: Coronation Street's official twitter account teased that Sinead will have her final scenes on the soap next week\n\nCoronation Street have worked closely with charities Mummy's Star and Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust on this storyline to ensure accuracy.\n\nPete Wallroth CEO of Mummy's Star founded the charity when his wife died shortly after the birth of their daughter.\n\nHe said: 'Cancer in pregnancy is a subject that few understand and even less realise happens to 2 women a day in the UK, so to have been asked by the Coronation Street team to work with them in advising on the storyline over the last 12 months with Rob and Katie has been both a pleasure and a wonderful opportunity.\n\n'They have listened to first hand accounts from women, asked for so much advice and this has been reflected so professionally and realistically on screen through their portrayal of Sinead and Daniel's harrowing experiences.\n\n'We know this has helped reach new audiences in terms of awareness and we are very thankful to the whole team at Coronation Street for giving the subject this platform and in doing so, indirectly helping more families.'\n\nHeadstrong: Back at home, after Daniel has left, Ken tries to comfort Sinead and tells her that he will get him to come back, but Sinead says no\n\nRebecca Shoosmith, Head of Support Services, Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust said: 'Nine women are diagnosed with cervical cancer every day in the UK and if caught early it is a very treatable cancer so it is fantastic that the programme has been able to raise awareness of the disease.\n\n'Sadly Sinead has an advanced diagnosis. We have been working very closely with Coronation Street on this incredibly moving and poignant storyline over the last year to ensure it is portrayed as accurately and sensitively as possible.\n\n'If you have concerns about your own health then please do get in touch as we can answer your questions and provide support at every step.'", "description": "A half hour episode on Thursday 24th October, and a special one hour show on Friday 25th October, will both be devoted to the final chapter of the emotional storyline", "authors": ["Ellie Phillips For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19710688-0-image-a-19_1571087455570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
