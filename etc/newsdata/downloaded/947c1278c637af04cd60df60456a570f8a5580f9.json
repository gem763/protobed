At the last but one medical committee that was put to FIFA and that is now is on the agenda for IFAB's next meeting.\n\n'There has been a suggestion from UEFA with input from myself and Ian and the committees we are on that that would be a positive step forward for two reasons.\n\n'One is to protect the welfare of the player. The other is to allow an adequate time for an assessment because at the minute we have three minutes on the pitch and the three minutes is not to make an assessment, it's really just to make that initial 'he's coming off' type decision.\n\n'Young players are different, which is why we came up with the 'if in doubt sit them out' policy.\n\nResearch has found that players are more likely to suffer neurological diseases from playing\n\n'There is no decision to make there. If a young player has a head injury playing football or training they are taken out. There is no medical decision to be made there, it's just a straight removal.'\n\nFootball already has strict protocols on when players are allowed to return to the game after head injuries.\n\nAnd consultant neuropathologist Dr Willie Stewart has urged football to introduce concussion substitutes across the board after his study compared the causes of death of 7676 Scottish players born between 1900 and 1976 to those of 23,000 individuals from the general population and came up with some worrying conclusions.\n\n'Look at how rugby deals with brain injury,' said Dr Stewart. 'It's the same brain whether you are a football or a rugby player.\n\nLaw makers may look to introduce concussion substitutes as seen in rugby as a new initiative\n\n'In rugby a player who potentially has a head injury or concussion is taken off and looked at with an extensive series of tests.\n\n'I'm not sure that's perfect - far from it - but 10 minutes off the park gives people a chance to figure out what is going on and that doesn't happen in football.\n\n'I know they say there is a three minute test, but I've yet to see that applied effectively.\n\n'Scotland does that a grassroots policy across all sports. We have a Scottish concussion guide that says if in doubt sit them out.\n\nFormer West Bromwich Albion player Jeff Astle died from dementia believed to have been caused by playing football. His family have set up a campaign for more research to be done\n\n'That should apply in all sports, across all levels of sport, no matter what the sport is.\n\n'Football, instead of this on-field assessment the doctor has to make while the player is running away from him, should be given the opportunity to get that player off and tested properly.\n\n'If that means getting another player on to fill their space fine. That's what we need to do.'\n\nInitiated by high profile campaigns by the families of former England player Jeff Astle and ex-Dundee United defender Frank Kopel, the research followed the loss of members of England's 1966 World Cup winning team and Celtic's European Cup winning side of 1967.\n\nWhile former players over the age of 70 were less likely to die of heart disease of lung cancer they were found to be five times more likely to die of alzhemiers disease, four times more likely to contract Motor Neurone Disease and twice as likely as the general public to die of Parkinson's disease.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Football's law makers are considering concussion subs after new research revealed that former players are significantly more likely to suffer neurological diseases.", "authors": ["Stephen Mcgowan For The Scottish Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/00/20012116-0-image-a-26_1571699671808.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
