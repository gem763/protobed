The theme was \"the spirit of sports and the building of a shared future for mankind\".\n\nHeld at the Samaranch Memorial Museum in Tianjin's southwestern Jinghai district, the event was initiated by David Gosset, founder of the Europe-China Forum.\n\nBokova and Wu Ching-kuo, a member of the IOC's executive board, shared their memories of Samaranch and some key moments in his life.\n\nSamaranch was committed to strengthening connections between the Olympics and the UN and was involved in efforts to promote peace, including the joint presence of both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nBokova said China's diverse methods and cultural values in sports were \"fascinating, impressive and inspiring\".\n\nYang Xiangquan, a professor in Tianjin Sports University's martial arts department, said: \"China-born sport activities such as martial arts are pursued for inner peace and harmony. \u2026 That also explains why Chinese people are good at settling problems through negotiation and taking the middle road.\"\n\nWu, who designed and founded the Samaranch museum, said it displays 16,000 items from the former IOC president's personal collection, which Samaranch had given to him.\n\n\"I have set up four museums in China to promote the Olympic spirit.
