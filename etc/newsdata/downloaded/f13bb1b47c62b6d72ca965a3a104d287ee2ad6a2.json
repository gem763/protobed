Eisen and Molnar considered the idea and rejected it.\n\nSources on the Latitude side said Latitude considered taking an equity position in Afterpay, but sources on the Afterpay side said there was never a term sheet or a formal offer of equity.\n\nNot actually free\n\nIt probably did not help Latitude\u2019s IPO that Afterpay was sharing with the market research that was scathing of the Latitude business model. The work was commissioned by Afterpay and had been updated following the release of the Latitude prospectus.\n\nThe work, done by Andrew Charlton from economics consultancy AlphaBeta, provided precise detail of the consequences for consumers if they missed a payment on popular Latitude credit cards.\n\nCharlton\u2019s report noted that Latitude\u2019s instalment product, which is advertised as \u201cinterest free\u201d was not actually free.\n\nThe instalment product, which accounts for about 58 per cent of group operating income, charges a variety of fees and interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsumers are charged a monthly fee of $5.95 or an annual fee of $99 depending on the platform used or the retail partner.\n\nAs well, there are payment handling fees of up to $2.50 and paper statement fees of $2.50.\n\nThe Latitude instalment product charges the following rates if repayments are not made on time or once the interest-free period ends: charges up to 29.49 per cent per annum once the interest-free period ends, a $30 late fee if the minimum monthly payment is not made.\n\nMore than 20 per cent of Latitude's outstanding interest-free instalment products have converted into interest-bearing and are therefore incurring the higher interest rates. This equates to 9 per cent of Latitude's gross receivables outstanding.\n\nOther Latitude product lines (personal loans and credit cards) have a number of extra fees and charges.\n\nPersonal loans charge a $13 monthly service fee, $35 late fees, as well as early termination fees of as much as $300. Latitude credit cards charge annual fees such as $69 on Latitude Low Rate Mastercard, cash advance fees of up to 3 per cent of cash advance, late fees of $30 and paper statement fees of $2.50, and payment handling fees up to $2.50.\n\nIt is no wonder that younger Australians, particularly Millennials and Generation Z, have low levels of trust for companies wanting to make money out of selling credit. Don\u2019t forget, the typical university-educated Australian enters the workforce with about $20,000 in HECS debt.\n\nThis is paid off through automatic deductions from pay packets - a factor that has made younger Australians conscious of sensible budgeting and the wisdom of paying off things through instalments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is obvious from the growth in the use of Afterpay and ZipMoney that Millennials have embraced buy now, pay later. They have shunned revolving credit products because they are seen as too costly and risky.\n\nThe numbers back this up. Over the past 10 years the usage of debit cards is twice the level of credit cards. The percentage difference is even higher when measured in terms of online commerce.\n\nIn financial 2019, consumers spent about $275 billion on credit cards and $336 billion on debit cards. The annual average spend per credit card in the year to July was about $12,836 which was roughly the same as the previous 12 months.\n\nIt is against this background of fundamental structural changes in the use of credit that Latitude came to the market with a business model that encouraged people to borrow more. The prospectus highlighted the fact that an increasing percentage of those with \u201cinterest free\u201d products were migrating to using their credit cards for other purposes.\n\nOne senior banker involved in the Latitude IPO said the sizzle in the stock was the potential sharp growth in earnings from cross-selling credit cards, personal loans and motor loans to new customers attracted by Latitude\u2019s buy now, pay later product called Latitude Pay.\n\nHe said the prospectus assumed active account growth of 13 per cent over a nine-month period for Latitude Pay. If this growth were maintained at more than 20 per cent on a full-year basis, then the business would have been on track to double active accounts over the medium term.\n\nThis meant the company could have grown the equivalent of a ZipMoney, which has a market capitalisation of $1.8 billion in a short space of time.\n\nBut the banker said the real question was what the growth in this product meant for the sales volume of credit cards, personal loans and motor loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the gross profit margin per account for Afterpay and ZipMoney was about $30 compared with Latitude\u2019s current larger ticket offering of $300 margin per customer.\n\nAn old world business model with high fees\n\nLatitude\u2019s credit cards, personal loans and motor loans are twice as profitable as its Latitude Pay accounts and 40 per cent of originations come from Latitude Pay.\n\nThe growth promise for investors was that if that 40 per cent of customer accounts started growing at more than 20 per cent then lending on credit cards, personal loans and motor loans should step up to double-digit rates.\n\nBroking analysts who wrote research for the Latitude IPO said the key leading indicator of success in consumer lending was the rate of growth in merchants signing up to use credit products.\n\n\u201cIf this is true, Latitude is well-positioned for success given its strong existing merchant network, its ability to compete against the incumbent buy now, pay later providers by offering low (and even nil) merchant service fees and its focus on customer centric technology and product innovation,\u201d the banker told Chanticleer.\n\nBut it is obvious these arguments did not appeal to investors at the price demanded by the vendors.\n\nThe Latitude IPO landed at a tricky time. It was being flogged at a time when regulators were increasingly focused on enforcing responsible lending. You only need read the risks section of the Latitude prospectus to see how many different parts of the business were under investigation or on the radar of regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its core Latitude is an old-world business model with high fees, high interest rates on revolving credit and extremely heavy consequences for any consumer who misses a payment.\n\nIt is competing in a market where consumers and investors are voting with their feet, and opting for purchasing schemes that involve regular budgeted payments.\n\nThere are negative consequences for missing payments when using Afterpay but the amount is capped at $17. Also, it blocks further use of the scheme until the debt is repaid. If all four instalment payments are missed at Afterpay, the fees are capped at 25 per cent of the order value.\n\nIt is telling that the dichotomy in the market between Latitude and Afterpay involves the incumbent (Latitude) being subject to much stricter regulatory oversight than the disruptor (Afterpay).", "description": "Latitude\u2019s failure to list on the stock exchange for a second time is a symbol of the profound change in investor perceptions of sustainable business models.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7894%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d6a30cbd4fc7f69d0162cb0aaf0ece6bc0667cbe", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
