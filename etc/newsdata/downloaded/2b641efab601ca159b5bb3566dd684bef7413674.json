Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOn Tuesday, Vazquez was arrested in relation to charges in Florida, where the girl and her family now live. But a criminal complaint released Wednesday in Pennsylvania shows charges have been added there, including multiple felonies.\n\nPolice said Vazquez, 28, admitted he attempted to have sex with the girl in a Pennsylvania driveway in 2017 but was unable to have intercourse. According to the complaint, Vazquez described it as \u201csex but not really.\u201d\n\nThe girl is now 16, and her mother called authorities after finding photos that Vazquez allegedly sent to her daughter electronically. In all, Vazquez faces charges that include statutory sexual assault, unlawful contact with a minor and indecent assault. A two-time All-Star, Vazquez has been placed on administrative league by Major League Baseball.\n\n\u2014The Drug Enforcement Administration is working to find the source of the drugs that Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs took before he died, ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d reported.\n\nSkaggs, 27, was found dead in his Southlake, Texas, hotel room on July 1 when the Angels were in town to play the Texas Rangers. His autopsy revealed he had oxycodone, fentanyl and ethanol in his system. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid, and the DEA typically joins investigations when fentanyl is involved to try to find the source, ESPN reported.\n\nWhen the medical examiner\u2019s office released the autopsy report on Aug. 30, Skaggs\u2019 family issued a statement that potentially implicated a team employee in his death. No team employee, however, has been tied publicly to the case.\n\n\u2014With the Red Sox all but eliminated from playoff contention, left-hander David Price won\u2019t pitch again in 2019, Boston manager Alex Cora said.\n\nPrice struggled with injuries this season, dealing with left elbow tendinitis, and more recently, a cyst on his left wrist. Price, 34, finishes the season with a 7-5 record and a 4.28 ERA \u2014 almost a full run over his 3.31 career ERA.\n\n\u201cWe need this guy healthy and ready to go (in the future),\u201d Cora said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best move for the player and for the organization.\u201d\n\n\u2014Houston Astros right-hander Aaron Sanchez will miss part of the 2020 season due to shoulder surgery, manager A.J. Hinch told reporters.\n\nSanchez underwent surgery on his throwing shoulder last week, and Hinch cited rehabilitation and recovery as factors for why the 27-year-old won\u2019t be ready for Opening Day.\n\nSanchez last pitched for the Astros on Aug. 20. He was acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays at the trade deadline on July 31. He went 5-14 with a 5.89 ERA in 27 starts this year, including a 2-0 mark and 4.82 ERA in four starts after the deal to Houston.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Pittsburgh Pirates closer Felipe Vazquez told police he made sexual contact with a 13-year-old girl, and he now faces additional charges in Pennsylvania, authorities said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431438827&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I054-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
