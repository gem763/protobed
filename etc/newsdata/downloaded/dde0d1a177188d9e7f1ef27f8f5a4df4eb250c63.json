It\u2019s a different thing with everyone saying you\u2019re the favourite but it\u2019s a different thing going and doing it.\u201d\n\nThe once mighty United States, who had been a non-factor in the women\u2019s sprints in Doha, also benefited from the scratches as Brittany Brown grabbed the silver in 22.22.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s Mujinga Kambundji completed the podium by grabbing bronze in 22.51.\n\nThe fight for medals was blown wide open when some of sprinting\u2019s biggest names withdrew during the earlier rounds.\n\nThe race was missing the reigning world and Olympic champions in Dutchwoman Dafne Schippers and Jamaica\u2019s Elaine Thompson who withdrew due to injuries.\n\nShaunae Miller-Uibo of Bahamas, owner of the fastest time this season, elected to race the 400m only due to scheduling issues.\n\nThe world 100m champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and bronze medallist Marie-Josee Ta Lou scratched because of soreness from earlier races while Nigeria\u2019s Blessing Okagbare, who had run the third fastest time this season, was disqualified in her heat.\n\nNone of that mattered to Asher-Smith who was focussed on making history, the 23-year-old blasting out of the blocks and in command coming off the bend before cruising to victory.\n\n\u201cI made sure that I remained focus,\u201d said Asher-Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to come here, to be in great shape but to lose focus over something very silly like getting caught up in the moment.\n\n\u201cWhenever I finish a championship, I always want to be able to look back and say I absolutely gave everything that I could have.\u201d\n\nThe victory doubled Britain\u2019s medal tally at the championships to two, both coming from Asher-Smith.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nBut the last few days of the competition could bring more gold for Britain with Katarina Johnson-Thompson taking a 96-point lead into the second day of the heptathlon.\n\nAsher-Smith could also add to her haul in the 4x100m relay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to relax and rest,\u201d smiled Asher-Smith. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll have a little cake. There are nice cakes in our hotel. Maybe a piece and a chocolate Bounty too.\u201d", "description": "Dina Asher-Smith seized her golden opportunity to win the world championship 200 metres on Wednesday and become the first British woman to claim a global sprint title.", "authors": ["Steve Keating", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436388004&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911R8"}
