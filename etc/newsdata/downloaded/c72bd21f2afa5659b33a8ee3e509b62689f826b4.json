FOREX-Euro gains as bank relief offsets ECB stimulus\n\n* Bank relief seen reducing FX impact of ECB stimulus\n\n* U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in August\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Karen Brettell\n\nNEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - The euro gained against the\n\ndollar on Friday for a second day after the European Central\n\nBank on Thursday exempted euro zone banks from a penalty charge,\n\nwhich analysts say will reduce the currency impact of new\n\nstimulus.\n\nThe ECB on Thursday cut its deposit rate to a record low\n\n-0.5% from -0.4% and said it will restart bond purchases of 20\n\nbillion euros a month from November. The purchases will run for\n\nas long as necessary and end shortly before it starts raising\n\nthe key ECB interest rates. It also said that euro zone banks will be exempted from\n\npaying a penalty charge on idle cash worth six times their\n\nmandatory reserves. \u201cCutting the deposit rate and introducing 'tiering' at the\n\nsame time was likely to have a mixed impact on the EUR and that\n\nseems to be one of the reasons why the weakness in EURUSD on\n\nThursday reversed abruptly,\u201d Stephen Gallo, European head of FX\n\nstrategy at BMO Capital Markets said in a report on Friday.\n\nThe single currency initially dropped on the new stimulus,\n\ntesting more than two-year lows, before dramatically changing\n\ndirection.\n\nBy exempting banks from the penalty charge, the ECB aims to\n\nminimize stress in financial institutions that have been harmed\n\nby years of low rates.\n\n\u201cTiering aims to protect the credit transmission channel,\n\nbut reduces the FX impact of lower interest rates,\u201d Morgan\n\nStanley analysts said in a report.\n\nThe euro gained 0.12% to $1.1074. The single currency\n\nfell as low as $1.0925 immediately after the ECB decision on\n\nThursday.\n\nShort covering as the euro failed to break below that level,\n\nand hopes of de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war also\n\nhelped turn the euro around after the ECB decision.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he preferred a\n\ncomprehensive trade deal with China but did not rule out the\n\npossibility of an interim pact, even as he said an \"easy\"\n\nagreement would not be possible. Data on Friday showed that U.S. retail sales increased more\n\nthan expected in August, pointing to solid consumer spending\n\nthat should continue to support a moderate pace of economic\n\ngrowth. That comes after better-than-expected producer price\n\ninflation data on Wednesday and consumer price data on Thursday.\n\nThe improving indicators are unlikely to sway the Federal\n\nReserve from cutting interest rates when it meets next week.\n\n========================================================\n\nCurrency bid prices at 2:16PM (1816 GMT)\n\nDescription RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid\n\nPrevious Change\n\nSession\n\nEuro/Dollar EUR= $1.1074 $1.1061 +0.12% -3.44% +1.1109 +1.1056\n\nDollar/Yen JPY= 108.1000 108.0900 +0.01% -1.96% +108.2600 +107.9300\n\nEuro/Yen EURJPY= 119.73 119.59 +0.12% -5.14% +120.0000 +119.5500\n\nDollar/Swiss CHF= 0.9905 0.9902 +0.03% +0.93% +0.9908 +0.9855\n\nSterling/Dollar GBP= 1.2472 1.2332 +1.14% -2.23% +1.2480 +1.2328\n\nDollar/Canadian CAD= 1.3272 1.3209 +0.48% -2.68% +1.3274 +1.3206\n\nAustralian/Doll AUD= 0.6885 0.6866 +0.28% -2.33% +0.6890 +0.6860\n\nar\n\nEuro/Swiss EURCHF= 1.0970 1.0955 +0.14% -2.52% +1.0974 +1.0928\n\nEuro/Sterling EURGBP= 0.8877 0.8969 -1.03% -1.19% +0.8975 +0.8874\n\nNZ NZD= 0.6379 0.6403 -0.37% -5.03% +0.6409 +0.6377\n\nDollar/Dollar\n\nDollar/Norway NOK= 8.9812 8.9671 +0.16% +3.96% +8.9853 +8.9386\n\nEuro/Norway EURNOK= 9.9458 9.9236 +0.22% +0.40% +9.9600 +9.9151\n\nDollar/Sweden SEK= 9.6083 9.6220 -0.06% +7.19% +9.6336 +9.5850\n\nEuro/Sweden EURSEK= 10.6416 10.6478 -0.06% +3.68% +10.6775 +10.6290", "description": "FOREX-Euro gains as bank relief offsets ECB stimulus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC6A013_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
