Here's how to make your costs more manageable", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE The higher standard deduction in the tax law signed by Donald Trump last year may require a few new moves for you to lessen your tax burden this year. USA TODAY\n\nHealth care is a major burden for working Americans across a wide range of income levels \u2013 so much so that the typical U.S. employee spends a whopping $7,685 on it per year, according to Bank of America's 2019 Workplace Benefits Report. That figure breaks down as $2,138 on out-of-pocket expenses (think copays and deductibles) and $5,547 on health insurance premiums.\n\nIf health care expenses eat too large a chunk of your income for comfort, make an effort to get them under control. That means finding the most cost-effective insurance plan, funding an FSA or HSA to lower your tax burden and staying on top of your health.\n\nIf you're struggling to keep up with medical costs, here are a few ways to ease that burden.\n\nHave you outgrown your credit card? Here are the 4 telling signs\n\nOnly 80 days until Christmas: Can a strong holiday season bolster a wavering economy?\n\n1. Choose the right health insurance plan\n\nChances are, your employer offers more than one health insurance plan for you to pick from. It's important to not only assess your options year after year, but make sure you fully understand what each one entails.\n\nOne thing you'll need to decide on is your deductible. The higher it is, the lower your monthly premiums are likely to be. If you don't expect to use your health insurance all that much, then a high-deductible health plan could be a solid choice for you. If you have a preexisting condition that requires lots of monitoring, or you simply tend to get sick a lot, then a low-deductible plan with higher premiums could make more sense.\n\nYou'll want to look at the specific coverage each plan you're offered provides and see what its policy is with regard to going out of network. Pay attention to referrals \u2013 some plans don't require them for specialists, others do. These are the details that will help you determine which plan is the most cost-effective.\n\n2. Take advantage of health care savings tools\n\nTax-advantaged tools such as flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) can lower your health care expenses by virtue of giving you a tax break on the money you use to pay for them. With an FSA, you allocate money to cover near-term medical expenses, and you must deplete your account balance by the time your plan year comes to an end. In an HSA, your funds don't expire; you can invest the money you're not using in a given year for added growth, then take withdrawals as the need arises. HSAs are an effective retirement savings tool for this reason.\n\nMost employees are able to fund an FSA if they so choose, but to contribute to an HSA, you must be on a high-deductible health insurance plan. The definition of that can change from year to year. In 2019, it's $1,350 or more for individual coverage, or $2,700 or more for family coverage. For 2020, these limits will increase to $1,400 for individual coverage, or $2,800 for family coverage. The IRS can't tax the money you put into an FSA or HSA, so although participating in these plans won't lower your medical costs directly, they'll put more cash in your pocket nonetheless.\n\n3. Get ahead of health issues before they escalate\n\nDelaying medical care can result in costlier bills down the line. Unfortunately, it's a common practice \u2013 32% of workers have skipped medical appointments to avoid paying for them, and 21% have skipped tests or procedures. If you allow medical issues to escalate, you could wind up costing yourself more money than necessary, not to mention harming your health.\n\nImagine you cut yourself but avoid an ER visit for stitches because you don't want to fork over the copay. If that cut gets infected and you wind up in the hospital for days, you'll not only lose out on income by virtue of missing work, but you'll probably rack up a much higher tab. The takeaway? Don't delay medical care. It's just a bad idea.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.
