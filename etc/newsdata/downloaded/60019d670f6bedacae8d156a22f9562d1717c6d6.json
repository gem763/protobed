There truly is strength in numbers. Just a few Republicans \u2014 notably Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, both avowed members of the party\u2019s noninterventionist wing \u2014 hailed the president\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cForeign policy has always been Trump\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heal with Senate Republicans,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former staff adviser to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican who faulted the president\u2019s Syria decision \u2014 but not his comments about China and Ukraine. Mr. Conant said Republicans were also driven by their view that Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy missteps were more damaging, requiring a more forceful response than his day-to-day incendiary statements.\n\n\u201cEveryone forgets Trump\u2019s tweets after a couple of days,\u201d Mr. Conant said. \u201cBut history will never forget if the U.S. allows our Kurdish allies to be massacred.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, foreign policy \u2014 unlike, say, impeachment \u2014 is lower on the president\u2019s priority list. Differences of opinion are less likely to spur him to lash out as he has in recent days, for example, at Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, after Mr. Romney said that the president\u2019s requests of Ukraine and China to investigate Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. were \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d Mr. Trump responded with name-calling, disparagement and a gleeful reminder of Mr. Obama\u2019s defeat of Mr. Romney in 2012.\n\nForeign policy appears to be one of the few areas where Mr. Trump is willing to brook some difference of opinion. Pressed on Monday about the tough criticism of his Syria policy from the likes of Mr. Graham; Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Nikki R. Haley, Mr. Trump\u2019s former United Nations ambassador, the president was uncharacteristically restrained.\n\n\u201cI have great respect for all of the people that you named,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd they have their opinion, and a lot of people do. And I could also name many more than you just named of people that totally are supportive. You see the names coming out; people are extremely thrilled because they say it\u2019s time to bring our people back home.\u201d", "description": "Foreign policy is one area where congressional Republicans have felt free to criticize the president, and they have bombarded him with public complaints over his decision to pull back in Syria.", "authors": ["Carl Hulse"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/us/politics/09dc-hulse/08dc-hulse-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
