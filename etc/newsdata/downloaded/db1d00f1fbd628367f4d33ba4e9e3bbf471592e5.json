That\u2019s Plan A. If for some reason Plan A isn\u2019t possible \u2014 we don\u2019t know that the House vote will take place until it\u2019s about to happen, there\u2019s a chance the House won\u2019t vote at all, or there\u2019s some other scenario \u2014 we\u2019ll do our best to announce a Plan B and to communicate with everyone clearly.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
