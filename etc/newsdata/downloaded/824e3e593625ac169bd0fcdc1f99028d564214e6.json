Hobbit Humphrey, 38, and Jake England-Johns, 35, refer to their 17-month-old child, Anoush, with the pronoun, \"they\", and dress them in both girls' and boys' clothing.\n\nThe married couple, who are members of the climate action group, Extinction Rebellion, have been accused of \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d. However, they are keen to let their child, Anoush, choose their own gender identity when they are old enough, because they wish for them to \u201cgrow into their own person\u201d.\n\nClose family members have not been told the child\u2019s sex and grandmother, Camille, only found out when she changed a nappy.\n\nRelated Video: Singer Sam Smith Changes Pronouns to Gender-Neutral\n\nThe couple, who live on a houseboat in Keynsham, Somerset, discussed the ways in which they could challenge gender bias after discovering Ms Humphrey was pregnant.\n\nMr England-Johns told the BBC\u2019s Inside Out: \u201cThe neutral in gender neutral refers to us trying to behave neutrally towards our child rather than trying to make them neutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cEventually, we decided that we wouldn\u2019t tell people whether they were a boy or a girl \u2026 in order to create this little bubble for our baby to be who they are,\u201d Ms Humphrey said.\n\nHowever their decision has sparked some controversy. Rosa Freedman, Professor of law conflict and global development at the University of Reading, said: \u201cWhile this is an individual case the worry would be that in the unlikely event many parents took up this way of parenting, that the NHS, government, and service providers would not know what to plan for in the future as they would not know how many boys or girls exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents concerned about gendered social construct would do better to fight patriarchy, homophobia and transphobia rather and try to virtue signal to their friends and communities so they can get praise.\u201d\n\nThe couple have said that the reaction to their decision has been mixed. However Mr England-Johns said: \u201cBut over a year in, it\u2019s clear that we are serious and gradually people have got used to it.\n\n\u201cAlthough, that still doesn\u2019t stop some pretty confused looks from old ladies in the park when they come up to us and ask if they\u2019re a boy or a girl. It can take a bit of explaining.\n\n\u201cWe are quite good now at holding space for people\u2019s discomfort in us going, \u2018Oh well, actually we don\u2019t tell anyone, we\u2019re not telling anyone for now.\u201d", "description": "A couple have decided to keep their baby\u2019s sex a secret from close relatives in a bid to avoid gender bias.\u00a0 Hobbit Humphrey, 38, and Jake England-Johns, 35, refer to their 17-month-old child, Anoush, with the pronoun, \"they\", and dress them in both girls' and boys' clothing.
