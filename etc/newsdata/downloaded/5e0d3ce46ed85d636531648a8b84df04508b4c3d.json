The outflows during the September 20 week were concentrated in government bond funds, which tend to be longer duration. And high yield funds picked up money: the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond fund HYG, -0.04% took in almost $1 billion during that one week. HYG has an effective duration of 2.8 years, Geisdorf said.\n\nHigh-yield also benefitted from the jump in oil prices. The energy sector makes up 12% of the Barclays High Yield Index.\n\nRead: This ETF became a \u2018success story\u2019 by offering a little yield in a falling-rate world", "description": "Investors fled U.S. fixed-income funds after bonds sold off in early September, but a lot of that money went back into high-yield.", "authors": ["Andrea Riquier"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FZ622_rotati_ZG_20171205134752.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
