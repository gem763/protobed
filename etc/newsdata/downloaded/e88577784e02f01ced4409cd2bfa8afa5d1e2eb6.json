He reported his concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.\n\nVindman also told investigators Tuesday that he tried to change the White House's rough transcript of the call by filling in at least one of the omitted words, \"Burisma,\" a reference to the company linked to Biden and his son, according to people familiar with his testimony. But Vindman was unsuccessful.\n\nHis concerns, though, were far bigger than the transcript. And lawmakers said his failed effort to edit it didn't significantly change their understanding of what transpired during Trump's call that sparked the impeachment inquiry.\n\nVindman's arrival in military blue, with medals, created a striking image at the Capitol as the impeachment inquiry reached deeper into the White House. He testified for more than 10 hours.\n\n\"I was concerned by the call,\" Vindman said, according to prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press. \"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.\"\n\nVindman, a 20-year military officer, added to the mounting evidence from other witnesses \u2014 diplomats, defense and former administration officials \u2014 who are corroborating the initial whistleblower's complaint against Trump and providing new details ahead of a House vote in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Every person has put it in higher resolution,\" said Rep. Denny Heck, D-Wash., during a break in the daylong session.\n\n\"That's the story: There's not like a new headline out of all of these,\" said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J. \"Every single witness, from their own vantage point, has corroborated the central facts of the story we've heard.\"\n\nThe inquiry is looking into Trump's call, in which he asked Zelenskiy for a \"favor\" \u2014 to investigate Democrats \u2014 that the Democrats say was a quid pro quo for military aid and could be an impeachable offense.\n\nWith the administration directing staff not to appear, Vindman was the first current White House official to testify before the impeachment panels. He was issued a subpoena to appear.\n\nTrump took to Twitter on Tuesday to denounce the probe as a \"sham,\" adding: \"Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER!\"\n\nVindman, who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union, said that it was his \"sacred duty\" to defend the United States.\n\nSome Trump allies, looking for ways to discredit Vindman, questioned the colonel's loyalties because he was born in the region. But the line of attack was rejected by some Republicans, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who said it was \"shameful\" to criticize his patriotism.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called the slams on Vindman \"absurd, disgusting and way off the mark. This is a decorated American soldier, and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands.\"\n\nThe testimony came the day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would vote on a resolution to set rules for public hearings and a possible vote on articles of impeachment.\n\nThursday's vote would be the first on the impeachment inquiry and aims to nullify complaints from Trump and his allies that the process is illegitimate and unfair.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the resolution merely \"confirms that House Democrats' impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorization by a House vote.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he and other GOP lawmakers will review the resolution to see if it passes a \"smell test\" of fairness to Trump.\n\nThe session Tuesday grew contentious at times as House Republicans continued trying to unmask the still-anonymous whistleblower and call him or her to testify. Vindman said he is not the whistleblower and does not know who it is.", "description": "Defying White House orders, an Army officer serving with President Donald Trump's National Security Council testified to impeachment investigators that he twice raised concerns over the administration's push to have Ukraine investigate Democrats and Joe Biden.
