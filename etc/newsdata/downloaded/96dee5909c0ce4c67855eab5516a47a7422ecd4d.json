The announcement came as the House impeachment investigation highlighted his work in Ukraine, where he promoted U.S. natural gas and where Trump hoped to find dirt on Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nTrump said that Perry, one of his longest serving Cabinet members, had planned for months to leave. But the timing of the announcement of Perry\u2019s departure fits a Trump pattern, said governance expert Kathryn Dunn Tenpas of the Brookings Institution. Her work shows there has been more turnover in Trump\u2019s Cabinet than under any president since at least Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cThe more important the issue is to the president, the more likely you\u2019re on the chopping block,\u201d Tenpas said.\n\nNo evidence has emerged that Perry explicitly pressured Ukrainian officials to comply with Trump\u2019s push to investigate a Ukraine natural gas company where Biden\u2019s son Hunter was a board member. It\u2019s a central part of the impeachment investigation.\n\nPerry, an evangelical who takes part in weekly Cabinet Bible studies, told a Christian broadcast news outlet his month that, \u201cGod as my witness,\u201d he never heard any administration figure specifically mention either Biden in discussions about corruption investigations in Ukraine.\n\nPerry did publicly pressure Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for unspecified reforms \u201cin the energy sector,\u201d however, including in comments at Zelenskiy\u2019s May inauguration.\n\nThat was one of several Perry trips and meetings putting him in contact with Ukraine and U.S. figures playing pivotal roles in the actions now being studied by the House committees investigating impeachment.\n\nPerry also was present for at least part of a White House meeting in July with then-natural security adviser John Bolton and other U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Perry, at the time, tweeted out a photo of the group lined up in front of the White House and called it a \u201cproductive discussion.\u201d\n\nTrump is trying to block members of his administration from testifying before lawmakers who are investigating whether Trump used the powers of his office for personal political aims in Ukraine. The Energy Department on Friday refused to comply with a House subpoena for Perry.\n\nA top State Department official, George Kent, has testified that the White House deputized Perry, Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker and Trump\u2019s European Union ambassador, Gordon Sondland, to run U.S. policy in Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J.\n\nPerry\u2019s public mission in Ukraine was in line with U.S. and European policy in place before the Trump administration: \u201cflood\u201d Europe with imported natural gas, as Perry said in a video in 2015, even before Trump won office. The policy is designed to help Ukraine and other Eastern European countries escape the political dominance that Russia\u2019s control of the region\u2019s energy supply has helped give Moscow.\n\nPerry\u2019s Texas roots gave him ties with the oil and gas companies exporting to Europe. But there are no allegations that Perry improperly arranged natural gas deals to benefit oil friends.\n\nCorruption in Ukraine can make doing business there dodgy, and Ukraine lacks the giant natural gas terminals and other facilities to import much natural gas shipments directly, energy experts say. That\u2019s made it less of a targeted customer for Western natural gas sales than, for example, Poland.\n\nPoland has done much better economically than Ukraine since the breakup of the Soviet Union, enabling Polish leaders to win favor with Trump by buying U.S. warplanes and natural gas.\n\nPerry has acknowledged that he consulted on Ukraine matters with Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani served as one of Trump\u2019s main, back channel movers in the administration\u2019s 2020-related political efforts in Ukraine, in talks bypassing official U.S. government channels.\n\nThe U.S. has indicted associates of Giuliani on allegations they illegally tried to funnel cash to Republican politicians, using a natural gas company as a front. It\u2019s part of the tangle of business and political administration efforts in Ukraine that impeachment investigators are trying to unravel.\n\nThe world Perry moves in as he promotes U.S. natural gas is rife with fringe characters, says Edward Chow, an expert in Eastern European and international energy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always these middlemen. Usually they present themselves as having some kind of political connections. Ninety-nine percent of these middlemen never score a deal,\u201d Chow said. \u201cThey talk about billion-dollar deals, and it\u2019s like, \u201cYeah? What\u2019s your bank number?'\u201d\n\nPublicly, Perry moved through that world as a champion of U.S. energy and energy policy, advocating for American oil and gas and coal, a Trump priority, but also encouraging countries to build up solar, wind and nuclear power.\n\nJames Melville Jr., U.S. ambassador to Estonia until he resigned last year in protest of Trump\u2019s treatment of European allies, said he was \u201cpositively impressed\u201d by Perry, in some ways, in their one encounter at an event on Baltic states.\n\nPerry \u201cwas friendly, he was cordial, he was talkative,\u201d and willing to meet Estonian officials that Melville brought over to introduce.\n\n\u201cHe struck me very much as a politician,\u201d Melville said. \u201cBroad knowledge but not very deep\u201d when it came to science-heavy matters under Perry\u2019s stewardship as energy secretary.\n\nBefore now, Perry\u2019s defining national moment came as a presidential candidate, when he forgot the name of the Energy Department in a 2011 debate as he was listing Cabinet agencies he wanted to eliminate.\n\nAs energy secretary, by most accounts he has been an active and eager leader, visiting the country\u2019s research labs and touring power plants. He worked well with lawmakers, in a job that required him to appeal annually to Congress for money for projects despite Trump\u2019s own call for cuts.\n\n\u201cThe coolest job I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said in his departure video Thursday.\n\nPerry stayed low-key with policy aims that ran counter to the president\u2019s likes, tamping down public shows of support for the wind turbines he had promoted as Texas governor, for example.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Long after more flamboyant colleagues flamed out of President Donald Trump's favor amid ethics scandals, low-profile and folksy Rick", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/c3af2c_trump-perry-07443-donald-trump-rick-perry-in-24-2017-file-photo-president-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
