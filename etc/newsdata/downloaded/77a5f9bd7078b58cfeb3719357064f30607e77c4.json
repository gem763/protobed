Harry will also visit Malawi and Angola during the family's trip, and will also undertake a \"working visit\" to Botswana.\n\nHere are five things to watch as Sussex mania descends on South Africa, a region Harry has called \"a second home.\"\n\nBaby Archie sightings!\n\nArchie will be one of the youngest royals to travel on an official trip overseas. He was born in May so will be nearly 5 months old as he joins his parents in South Africa.\n\nHarry and Meghan are bringing Archie's nanny with them on the trip.\n\nBuckingham Palace has not revealed when, or if, Archie will join Harry and Meghan at official events, but we're hoping there will be at least a few sightings of the young royal.\n\nMoments tied to Princess Diana\n\nPrince Harry will make a poignant visit to Huambo and the same location where his mother, the late Princess Diana, was famously photographed visiting a de-mining site and visiting with landmine victims.\n\nTim Graham/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe area where Harry will visit is now a busy area with schools and shops, a far cry from the scene his mom saw in 1997.\n\nHe will be greeted in Huambo by the same official, Gov. Joana Lina, who was the official host for Princess Diana's visit, according to Buckingham Palace.\n\nHarry will also visit the Huambo Orthopaedic Centre, which Diana visited in 1997.\n\n\"The Duke is especially proud to continue the legacy left by his mother with her work in Angola as he joins Halo Trust again in an effort to rid the world of landmines,\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.\n\nMeghan's focus on empowering women\n\nFresh off the debut of Meghan's Smart Set fashion collection designed to empower women, expect to see the duchess championing women in South Africa, too.\n\nShe is scheduled to host events focused on female entrepreneurs and leaders and women and girls' health and education during the 10-day tour.\n\nMeghan had one of her biggest moments on the couple's last major overseas tour, right after their 2018 wedding, when she declared \"feminism is about fairness\" during a speech in New Zealand.\n\nA celebration of young people\n\nMeghan, 38, was named in March as vice president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, an organization that supports and connects young leaders in the Commonwealth, which includes countries in Africa.\n\nHarry, 35, was named Commonwealth Youth Ambassador last year by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nWhile in South Africa, the duke and duchess are expected to participate in events focused on young people and issues of concern to them, like employment, mental health and the environment.\n\nOn the environment, Harry will reveal a new initiative during the trip, Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy. The initiative is described by Buckingham Palace as a \"three-country partnership which he designed and consulted with Governments in Namibia, Botswana and Angola to protect forest and wildlife corridors around the Okavango Delta.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan's personal attachment to Africa\n\nAfrica is where Harry whisked Meghan away a few weeks after the couple's first date in 2017.\n\n\"I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,\" Harry said in a post-engagement interview last year. \"She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic, so then we were really by ourselves, which I think was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other.\"\n\nHarry, who established his charity, Sentebale, in the African country of Lesotho in 2006, also included a piece of Botswana in Meghan's engagement ring. The main stone in Meghan's ring is sourced from Botswana, while the diamonds surrounding it are from the jewelry collection of Harry's mother.\n\nHarry has also said in previous interviews that Africa will always have sentimental value to him because Africa is where he and Prince Charles and Prince William went to \"get away from it all\" after Diana's death in 1997.", "description": "The Sussexes will spend 10 days in Africa.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/harry-meghan-file-ap-ml-190916_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
