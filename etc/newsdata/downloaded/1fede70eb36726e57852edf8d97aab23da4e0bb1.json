The debut of products such as Bakkt\u2019s regulated Bitcoin futures in September shows a desire to cater to institutional demand.\n\nGrayscale, the world\u2019s largest crypto-focused asset manager, this month revealed that demand had remained strong throughout 2019.\n\nDemirors, however, was more skeptical. She queried:\n\n\u201cIf we take 50% of the world\u2019s Bitcoin and we put it in custody with a custodian that\u2019s regulated... and we take these Bitcoins, and we put them in a vault somewhere\u2026 and then we issue Bitcoin depository receipts \u2014 pieces of paper that allow us to trade the underlying Bitcoins sitting in a vault somewhere \u2014 but we never actually exchange Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network, is that still Bitcoin?\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re part of the problem\u2019\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Bakkt, in particular, got off to a slow start on its release, with Bitcoin markets in fact tumbling just days after its contracts went live. At the same time, a similar offering from exchange Binance has seen more intense uptake.\n\nDemirors remained dismissive of professional financiers\u2019 interests in the Bitcoin arena, describing them as \u201clive-action role-playing.\u201d\n\nCoinShares, too, potentially contributes to that style of behavior.\n\n\u201c...As an asset manager, we are a part of the problem,\u201d she added.\n\nNonetheless, for those interested in commodities and safe-haven investments, she conceded that at present, Bitcoin does represent the next best thing to gold.\n\n\u201cI think Bitcoin is digital gold,\u201d she concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s the digital analog to gold.\u201d", "description": "A deluge of interest in Bitcoin from big finance may not be the catalyst for adoption in the long term, warns Meltdem Demirors", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZGU0NmMxYTk0NDA3MmVlODljYTZhZmMwNDBiOTIzZDAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
