Rounds of white onion at the \u201cankle\u201d mimic the cross section of bone that would be revealed after the ruddy, necrotic-looking appendage had been chopped from a human body. But the extra-shuddery sensation you might have felt probably came from the concoction\u2019s piece de resistance: rounded slivers of onion perfectly formed into ghostly, grisly toenails that no manicurist in their right mind would touch.\n\n[How to concoct frighteningly good Halloween cocktails]\n\nThe simple caption added to the gross-out effect. \u201cFeetloaf,\u201d it reads.\n\nPerhaps you have stopped reading right here and are clicking around somewhere else looking for videos of baby animals in the hopes of purging this image from your mind\u2019s eye. No one could blame you. This is grade-A sickening stuff.\n\nBut for some reason, many of us love it. Or we \u201clike\u201d it, at least \u2014 the original photo has been liked on Twitter nearly 28,000 times and retweeted nearly 9,000 times. People have reacted with memes registering their disgust. Others posted their own attempts at the dish. But many have kept it simple and just posted the picture with its revolting portmanteau of a caption.\n\nFeetloaf pic.twitter.com/SeMSOY8w5D \u2014 Lil Rich Aka Crash (@Crash_The_King) October 15, 2019\n\nYou can blame this recent collective wave of nausea on Richard Wilson, a Tulsa rapper who goes by Lil Rich Aka Crash. He\u2019s the one who took the picture and posted it this month. But Wilson did not mean to make you ill, friends.\n\nIn a phone interview, Wilson says he was just trying to make a funny dinner for his five kids. He was inspired, he said, by something his family would say about one of his aunties, when he was growing up. \u201cWe used to say that she put her foot into her food,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what all us young \u2019uns said \u2014 so I thought it would be a good joke to make a foot.\u201d\n\nFeet and food might sound incompatible, especially in what was supposed to be a compliment, but that\u2019s how the expression goes. In Southern African American slang, saying that someone put in their foot in their cooking is a compliment of the highest order.\n\nFeetloaf actually predates Wilson\u2019s stroke of genius, however. Recipes for it have been popping up for more than a decade.\n\n[Six recipes to use up all of your \u2018extra\u2019 Halloween candy]\n\nThe origins of feetloaf aren\u2019t, unlike a perfectly sawed tibia, clear-cut. References to the dish begin to appear on blogs around 2009, with one early poster describing having gotten the recipe for it from a pamphlet she randomly bought while standing in line at the grocery store. Here\u2019s her story:\n\n\u201cThere at the check stand, I found a little book with several Halloween recipes in it, and the following recipe (with my alterations) gets made at our home every year in time for Halloween. While truly, it looks kind of nasty (the whole toenails thing \u2014 gag!), taste-wise, this rivals my grandmothers meatloaf, yet it is much easier than grandma\u2019s!\u201d\n\nIn a giant missed opportunity, the dish isn\u2019t referred to as feetloaf, but rather as \u201cBloody Stump\u201d or \u201cFeet of Meat.\u201d It also calls for Brazil nuts or almonds to serve as the toenails, which make the final creation resemble a cartoonish monster paw more than a realistic severed human appendage.\n\nSince then, it has circulated around the Internet, some with lifelike (deathlike?) flourishes. It seemed to have a bit of a moment in 2014, when it was among the Halloween foods the hosts of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday Show\u201d sampled. Kathy Lee Gifford might have spoken for all of America with her initial reaction to its unveiling: \u201cOh.\u201d\n\nWe even tried our \u2026 hand at creating the dish, doubling one of our meatloaf recipes and using various online iterations as models for sculpting it. (One pro tip for helping the meat keep its shape was chilling it in the fridge after assembling, but before baking. And for an extra Dexter-esque touch, we served it on a quarter sheet pan that looked like a laboratory pan and swapped a serving knife for a little handsaw.)\n\nOkay, so we might know how this dish made its terrifying way into our social media feeds, but the better question is (and please read this in your head delivered in a despairing shriek): whhhhhyyyyyyyy?\n\nOne reason is that it\u2019s just the entry du jour into the burgeoning category of Halloween foods, a genre practically made for social media, particularly Pinterest, where craft tutorials and DIY culture flourishes.\n\nIn the not-so-distant past, traditional Halloween \u201cfood\u201d was mostly candy: sugary corn kernels in bowls on office desks and handfuls of mini-chocolate bars coveted by trick or treaters. The holiday didn\u2019t have a strong culinary heritage, like Thanksgiving, with its turkey and stuffing, does. Easter has its hams, the Fourth of July has its barbecue, and Christmas, of course, is the time for cookies and eggnog.\n\nAnd the celebration once known as All Hallow\u2019s Eve was long considered a kids\u2019 holiday in modern history \u2014 but that\u2019s clearly changed, says Chris-Rachael Oseland, a food writer whose \u201cDead Delicious Horror Cookbook\u201d is filled with recipes for dishes that look like disassembled body parts (her \u201cSweet Flayed Corpse,\u201d for example, uses crepes to mimic flaps of skin).\n\nHalloween is \u201ca contemporary adult holiday,\u201d she says. \u201cBut there aren\u2019t traditions, so we have to make it up as we go along.\u201d\n\nAnd where do we look for ideas of any kind these day? Scrollscrollscroll.\n\n\u201cSocial media is often what tells us how to perform the rituals of this holiday,\u201d Oseland says.\n\nBut feetloaf has a gross-out factor that goes beyond many of the dishes you see on your cousin\u2019s \u201cCreepy Halloween Ideas\u201d board on Pinterest. Some of those might fall into the kinda-cute category, like mummy dogs (franks encased in crescent dough, often with olive pieces for eyes) or cupcakes sprouting spider legs. Others are more realistically macabre: There\u2019s an entire genre of severed-finger-shaped snacks made of sugar cookie dough, hot dogs and more.\n\nEven in this bloodbath of red food coloring and pumpkins vomiting cheese dip, feetloaf stands apart.\n\nEmily Contois, a media studies professor at the University of Tulsa who studies food in pop culture and social media, says it\u2019s not just run-of-the-mill spooky, but particularly transgressive.\n\nAs many of us become ever distant from the origins of our food, the feetloaf\u2019s jutting tibia and meaty flesh remind us that we\u2019re about to eat the slaughtered carcass of a living thing. \u201cThe visible bone and the literally ground meat that comes from an animal forces us to think about the violence inherent in eating animals,\u201d she said. \u201cMeatloaf in a pan wouldn\u2019t have that effect.\u201d\n\nOseland notes that the photos that seem to have provoked the strongest reaction, including Wilson\u2019s, feature the meaty concoction in its unbaked form. That\u2019s when it\u2019s at its most frighteningly realistic stage, she notes, before the heat of the oven renders it more formless and the color less raw-flesh-like.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s our collective deal with feet. Sure, some fetishists get their kicks from toes, but a more common reaction to an exposed lower extremity is revulsion. A dish modeled after a human hand wouldn\u2019t have quite the same resonance, Contois notes. \u201cIt\u2019s an appendage that\u2019s connected to the earth and to the dirt,\u201d she said, adding that other people\u2019s feet often bring up feelings of disgust while our own might make us feel shame.\n\nAnd yet feetloaf strides on, not just despite the repugnance we feel when gazing upon it, but because of it. And that just might be the true spirit of Halloween, the holiday that\u2019s based not on celebrating birth or rebirth, but the blurring of the line between the living and the dead. It\u2019s also associated with the temporary lifting of societal norms (scary is good! pranks are allowed!), making feetloaf the meaty embodiment of the holiday\u2019s ethos.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Halloween is about,\u201d Oseland says. \u201cIt\u2019s pushing boundaries, and being giggly and subversive at the same time.\u201d", "description": "Even in the bloodbath of red food coloring that is Halloween cuisine, this dish stands apart.", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Food Reporter", "October At Pm", "Emily Heil Is A Reporter Covering National Food News", "Trends.
