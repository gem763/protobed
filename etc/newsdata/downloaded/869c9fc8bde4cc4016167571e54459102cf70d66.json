Democrats have accused the president of abusing the power of his office to pressure a foreign country to pursue investigations that could benefit his re-election campaign. Mr. Trump has dismissed the inquiry as a hoax and denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe testimony Thursday, as with other recent witnesses, is taking place in a closed session. The Wall Street Journal viewed a copy of Mr. Sondland\u2019s opening statement to the committees.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nMeanwhile, a top White House official said President Trump\u2019s decision to hold up aid to Ukraine last summer was tied to his demand that Kyiv investigate matters related to the 2016 election, but defended the stance as a standard part of foreign policy.\n\n\n\nActing chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said a separate request Mr. Trump later made\u2014that Ukraine also investigate the Bidens\u2014wasn\u2019t part of the aid conditions. In his remarks to reporters Thursday, Mr. Mulvaney said he was \u201c100% comfortable\u201d with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role as Mr. Trump\u2019s outside adviser on Ukraine and also his personal lawyer.\n\nMr. Sondland\u2019s prepared testimony includes criticism of the president and his handling of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine on a number of fronts, including Mr. Trump\u2019s request in a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and the president\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine about a week before that call. He said he \u201cregretted\u201d the departure of Marie Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump this spring ousted as ambassador to Ukraine after Mr. Giuliani raised concerns about her. Mr. Sondland described her as an \u201cexcellent diplomat\u201d and a \u201cdelight to work with.\u201d\n\n\u201cInviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,\u201d Mr. Sondland said in his prepared testimony. \u201cI did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings. In my opinion, security aid to Ukraine was in our vital national interest and should not have been delayed for any reason.\u201d\n\nIn the testimony, Mr. Sondland, a former hotel executive with no previous diplomatic experience who donated $1 million to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, also provided his view on several key meetings and conversations regarding Ukraine that have come to light in recent weeks.\n\nAt a May White House meeting that followed the U.S. delegation\u2019s trip to Ukraine for the inauguration of Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump expressed skepticism that Ukraine was \u201cserious about reforms and anticorruption\u201d and directed those present\u2014including Mr. Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.)\u2014to talk to Mr. Giuliani about his concern, Mr. Sondland said.\n\n\u201cIt was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Mr. Sondland told House committees.\n\n\u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cPlease know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials, including then-special representative for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker, pursued Mr. Giuliani after the meeting rather than abandon their goal of arranging a White House meeting with Mr. Zelensky, which Mr. Sondland and others viewed as crucial to U.S. foreign policy goals in the region. Mr. Perry said he called Mr. Giuliani soon after that meeting to seek to resolve his concerns.\n\nBut Mr. Sondland said Thursday he didn\u2019t understand until months later that Mr. Giuliani was working to push Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, even though Mr. Giuliani on Twitter and in TV interviews this spring repeatedly called for investigations into Mr. Biden. He also said he didn\u2019t learn until the White House released a rough transcript of the president\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky last month that Mr. Trump had asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the Bidens.\n\nIn late July, Mr. Sondland said he exchanged emails with Mr. Volker and Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Kyiv, in which \u201cwe all agreed that President Zelensky should have no involvement in 2020 U.S. presidential election politics.\u201d Mr. Sondland didn\u2019t give context for those emails.\n\nMr. Sondland also sheds new light on another key moment: a September conversation he had with the president after Mr. Taylor raised concerns that the hold on aid to Ukraine was linked to the investigations the president wanted. The concerns from Mr. Taylor were detailed in a series of text messages provided by Mr. Taylor earlier this month.\n\nIn his testimony, Mr. Sondland said he asked Mr. Trump, \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d The president responded: \u201cNothing. There is no quid pro quo.\u201d Mr. Trump, who appeared to be in a bad mood, repeated \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d multiple times, Mr. Sondland said. He also said he couldn\u2019t independently verify the president\u2019s assurance since he wasn\u2019t involved in the hold on aid.\n\nMr. Taylor will appear before the committees on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Taylor had challenged Mr. Sondland, telling him in a Sept. 9 text that \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nThe committees are also likely to ask Mr. Sondland about an August conversation he had with Mr. Johnson, who said he called Mr. Trump to inquire about a quid pro quo after the ambassador described such an arrangement to him. Mr. Trump denied the existence of a quid pro quo to Mr. Johnson, the senator said. Mr. Sondland doesn\u2019t remember his conversation with Mr. Johnson that way, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nMr. Sondland also said Thursday that while Mr. Giuliani in an August conversation brought up Burisma Holdings\u2014a Ukrainian gas company whose board Hunter Biden once sat on\u2014Mr. Sondland at the time didn\u2019t understand the company to be connected to the Bidens. Instead, he said, he believed the company to be \u201cone of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs and lacking the type of corporate governance structures found in Western companies.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani raised Burisma with Mr. Sondland while telling the ambassador that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Zelensky to issue a public statement committing Ukraine to investigate corruption issues, including the 2016 election and Burisma Holdings, Mr. Sondland said. Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker had been working with Ukrainian officials on the draft of the statement, which Ukraine ultimately opted not to issue.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Burisma Holdings while his father oversaw U.S. policy on Ukraine as vice president. Both have denied wrongdoing.\n\nPortions of Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony may be at odds with what Fiona Hill, former National Security Council Russia adviser, told House committees earlier this week. Ms. Hill told committees she and then-National Security Adviser John Bolton were alarmed by Mr. Sondland\u2019s mention of investigations in a July meeting with senior Ukrainian officials, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Hill later reported her concerns to an NSC lawyer.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s testimony, Mr. Sondland told the committees that he never heard of any concerns from either Ms. Hill or Mr. Bolton. \u201cI have to view her testimony\u2014if the media reports are accurate\u2014as the product of hindsight and in the context of the widely known tensions between the NSC, on the one hand, and the State Department, on the other hand,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "description": "Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, criticized President Trump over his efforts to enlist Ukraine in investigating a political rival.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIVE3h.img?h=202&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=662&y=294", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
