Boxing spectacle or commercial gimmick?\n\nThe first chapter in this curious tale started back in February 2018 when KSI first stepped into the ring with Joe Weller. An instant sell out, 7,500 screaming fans crammed into London\u2019s Copper Box Arena to watch the 26-year-old YouTuber, wearing a bright red headguard, win via stoppage. This was, after all, an amateur bout.\n\n\u201cIf any YouTuber wants it they can come and get it. Jake Paul, Logan Paul, any of the Pauls I don\u2019t care. Bring it,\u201d said KSI, full of adrenaline in the aftermath of his victory.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Paul, on the back of the near career-ending suicide forest incident, was looking for an out, a distraction. He found it. Boxing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

California\n\nIn the way so many young up and coming boys and girls who need a new lease of life find, boxing answered the call.\n\nThis time, an upgrade. With a combined following of well over 50,000,000 people, the tiny Copper Box simply wouldn\u2019t do.\n\nThe Manchester Arena it was. A total of 18,000 people in attendance, pay-per-view online, KSI defending his \u2018YouTube Boxing Championship\u2019 against the man who everyone wanted to hurt. Headguards back on and away they went.\n\nWhat happened next was unprecedented. The fight, ending in a controversial draw, sold 1,300,000 pay-per-views at \u00a37.50 per person. \u00a310,000,000 was generated from online purchases alone. A monumental success for all involved. Something that only the elite in contact sport are capable of, the Floyd Mayweathers of the world, the Conor McGregors. KSI and Paul have bigger followings than both men combined.\n\nAnd so here we are, over a year on from the \u2018Biggest Internet Event in History\u2019 and with a score still to settle, KSI and Paul meet again. This time, the Staples Centre plays host. The arena that has seen it all: Oscar de la Hoya vs Shane Mosley, Lennox Lewis vs Vitali Klitschko, Deontay Wilder vs Tyson Fury.\n\nNow KSI vs Logan Paul.\n\nWe all know that the quality won\u2019t be at the same level as the many world title fights the legendary arena has seen, but this time it\u2019s different.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s professional rules. No headguards, 10oz gloves, KSI and Paul are getting into the real hurt business.\n\nPromoted by Matchroom Boxing USA\u2019s Eddie Hearn, this is no gimmick. There will be no YouTubers on the undercard, it won\u2019t be on the platform that caters to their millions of followers. This time it\u2019s different.\n\nWorld champions want to be on the undercard, others won\u2019t be able to keep their eyes away. Billy Joe Saunders, the WBO super middleweight champion of the world, personally send KSI a text message asking if he could be on the card.\n\nA genius marketing move by the struggling DAZN which, having failed to put together the trilogy bout between Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez and Gennady Golovkin, looks to round off its 2019 in strong fashion, with Anthony Joshua also attempting to regain his belts from the grasp of boxing\u2019s unlikeliest hero, Andy Ruiz Jr. Put KSI vs Logan Paul up there. From one streaming service in YouTube to another in DAZN, this will be easy for the pair\u2019s millions of consumers to convert to. It could be the biggest fight the platform has seen to date \u2013 and will ever see.\n\nHopes that fans of the YouTube stars tuning in to the fight will convert into full-time boxing fans are ambitious, but could just work.\n\nRyan Garcia, darling of Golden Boy Promotions, manages to blur the line between boxing prospect and online sensation.\n\nA boxing talent with an 18-0 record, 15 by way of knockout, the 21-year-old could well be on his way to a world title bid. But he understands that being a good boxer just isn\u2019t enough anymore. With an Instagram following of over 3,300,000 and the star of a YouTube series, \u2018The Flash\u2019 caters to his young audience. And it\u2019s helped him; he sells out minor arenas and is known among the mainstream as well as the typical hardcore boxing crowd.\n\nWhy can\u2019t it work the other way? With KSI and Paul lacing up their gloves for their professional debuts among the bruising cruiserweight division, this huge event, which guarantees millions of pay-per-view buys and an instant sell out crowd of 20,000, could become the new norm for the YouTube generation, its stars and their followers.", "description": "KSI vs Logan Paul.
