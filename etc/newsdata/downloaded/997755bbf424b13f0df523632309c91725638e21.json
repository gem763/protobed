Approval ratings measure a president\u2019s political power, at least in part.\n\nBy this vital measure, Trump stands about 20 points below Clinton, but 12-14 points higher than Nixon.\n\nMoreover, while the number who favor impeaching and removing Trump jumped in recent weeks, his approval rating barely wiggled.\n\nClinton\u2019s much higher approval also barely budged during the process, while Nixon\u2019s fell precipitously.\n\nDamaged by Vietnam and America\u2019s fall into recession, as well as by Watergate, Nixon\u2019s approval rating plummeted from over 50 percent to about 25 percent before a group of GOP senators, led by Barry Goldwater, informed the then-president that his fellow Republicans would vote to remove him from office.\n\nTrump was never as popular as either Clinton or Nixon at their highs. Indeed, Trump is the most consistently unpopular president in the history of polling.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s sickly approval rating has yet to fall from the low 40s where it\u2019s hovered for most of his presidency. Momentum and levels are both important in understanding public opinion and there\u2019s no evidence yet of downward momentum in Trump\u2019s approval rating.\n\nRemoving a president from office, whether through conviction or the threat of conviction, requires at least some level of bipartisanship, and that\u2019s where another critical difference emerges between Nixon\u2019s final weeks and Trump\u2019s current standing.\n\nNixon\u2019s approval rating dipped below 50 percent among Republicans even before the committee vote on impeachment. As the president\u2019s power ebbed in his own party, fellow Republicans became more willing to criticize and oppose him.\n\nWhile Trump lies about his poll support from Republicans, and it\u2019s beginning to show some cracks, his approval nonetheless remains substantial with the GOP. Eighty-five percent of Republicans continue to approve of his performance, according to the latest YouGov survey, a far cry from where Nixon stood.\n\nEven if more than half the country wants him impeached, until we see Trump\u2019s approval rating fall further, fueled by Republican defections, the chances of the Senate removing him from office are probably negligible.\n\nBut if hearings and revelations lead Republicans to desert Trump, as they left Nixon, he may not remain in office long enough to lose the next election.\n\nMellman is president of The Mellman Group and has helped elect 30 U.S. senators, 12 governors and dozens of House members.
