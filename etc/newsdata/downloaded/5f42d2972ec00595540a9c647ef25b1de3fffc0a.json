I freaked out, said to Michael what if I trip again and I land on her and I hurt her, or worse?\n\nThen I became convinced it was going to happen, that I shouldn't carry her or be around her because I felt I was going to hurt her.\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\nCan you imagine how terrifying that is?\n\nThe complete opposite of everything you are goes running through your mind.\n\nMy sister was in tears because I was so out of my mind with fear.\n\nI had to call my mum and dad and tell them something was wrong with me, I couldn't be around Ivy or something bad would happen.\n\nI asked Michael to call me an ambulance and have me sectioned.\n\nI remember him rubbing my arms and my back and telling me to breathe.\n\nIt was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.\n\nI didn't sleep that night and I had chemo the morning after.\n\nI remember the nurses being surprised how low I was when I sat in the familiar chemo chair.\n\nThey asked was I OK and I told them 'no, I'm really not'.\n\nI thought I needed to speak to someone, thought that there was something wrong with me.\n\nThey were, as always, incredible.\n\nI was lucky enough to speak with the oncology psychologist the day after and she incredibly managed to calm me down.\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\nShe told me it was absolutely normal, ohhh that lovely, lovely word - normal.\n\nThe fact that I was so terrified of my thoughts proved how much of a loving mummy I was.\n\nA thought is just a thought, it's not an action, just a silly thought. Let it pass through.\n\nShe gave me a really helpful technique which was to have five minutes a day where I think of all the negative things that could happen, rationalise them and then tell them to bugger off and fill the rest of my day with good thoughts.\n\nThat way, the scary thoughts have been and gone and I don't have to wait for them to spring up on me uninvited.\n\nI couldn't even tell my friends about what had happened.\n\nI honestly thought they wouldn't want me near their children, they'd think I'd 'lost it' and not want to spend time with me, or they'd speak to me like I was 'mental'.\n\n(Image: Roisin Pelan)\n\nBut one day about a year later, I was talking in the car with one of my friends who has a baby the same age as Ivy.\n\nShe told me about really struggling with awful thoughts when her baby was new.\n\nShe'd confided in her health visitor who had told her that she speaks to women in the exact same shoes many times a week.\n\nI then told her what had happened to me and we both cried with relief in the car.\n\nEven up until this very day, writing this, most people don't know about what happened.\n\nI wish so much I had felt brave enough to tell people without fear of being judged.\n\nJust to know, it is normal - YOU are normal, highs and lows, ups and downs, hysteria and depression. It's real life.\n\nEveryone is not as hunky dory as they seem and the minute we start letting the pretence down, the sooner we will feel a sense of ease with talking about things that are sometimes judged and sometimes difficult.\n\nSadly, the wait times for mental health help with our NHS are dangerous at the moment.\n\nThere are no funds and life threatening waits for talking therapies.\n\nWe need more funding into our NHS which we aren't going to get with Boris - but that's another column altogether.\n\nTalk it out, write it down if you can't talk and send it to someone.\n\nYour life is in your hands, you will be okay.....now is not forever.", "description": "Mirror columnist and breast cancer fighter Roisin Pelan urges people to talk and make sure they seek help if they're battling mental health issues", "authors": ["Roisin Pelan", "Image"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586777.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Roisin-Pelan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
