They don't want to be involved in the immigration enforcement process. But, we're not asking them to,\" he told Jenkins.\n\n\"What we're saying is we know when we notify you that we have probable cause -- you have detained someone that's in the country illegally -- notify us before you release them.\n\n\"You don't have to hold them one minute past when you would normally hold them in your charges. But before he walks out the door: call us and we'll be there. There's no liability there. There's no legal question there.\"\n\n\"That's not enforcing immigration law. That's cops working with cops to protect the community.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe concluded: \"That's the false narrative being pushed by the politicians, and that's what upsets me every time we talk about these cases.
