That kind of hospitality, she says, continued throughout her stay. Often gathered around a bonfire in the middle of the desert, Prinsloo, her travel partners\u2014which included a photographer and a videographer\u2014and the staff of Desert Rhino Camp would share stories and take in the majesty of the free-roaming rhinoceroses around them.\n\nPrinsloo was raised in the Namibian town of Grootfontein, about a six-hour drive from Desert Rhino Camp. But the model and environmental activist\u2019s 10-day trip to Namibia last spring was more than just a homecoming\u2014it was the first step on a mission of animal conservation. She traveled from her current home in Los Angeles to Africa with Save the Rhino Trust (SRT) Namibia, kicking off a partnership with the nonprofit organization.\n\n\u201cIt is so important for anyone who has a platform to take a stand,\u201d says the 31-year-old Victoria\u2019s Secret model and wife of Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to waste when it comes to the environment.\u201d\n\nAs the mother of two young daughters, ages 1 and 3, Prinsloo often thinks about how future generations will experience Africa and its animals, hoping that others\u2014including her daughters\u2014will be able to interact with them the way she did. Grootfontein is about an hour from Etosha National Park, known for a wealth of wildlife. Her father, she says, is very adventurous, and family vacations were often safaris in places like Botswana and South Africa.\n\n\u201cWhen you grow up there, you\u2019re part of nature, and you appreciate it in a different way,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know that if you lose any of those animals, Africa loses a part of its soul.\u201d\n\nPrinsloo, who moved to London at age 15, hadn\u2019t been back to Namibia since 2012, due in part to the births of her children. \u201cNow was the right time in my life because I just had my two kids, and I really felt the need to live by example for them,\u201d she said over tea at a Midtown Manhattan hotel a few weeks after her trip.\n\nThe heart of Prinsloo\u2019s trip was at Desert Rhino Camp, in northwest Namibia, which is open to the public. Photograph by Hugh Lippe\n\nWhile she visited several areas of Namibia on her journey, the heart of the trip was in the northwest at Desert Rhino Camp, a joint venture between travel group Wilderness Safaris, SRT, and local conservancies. It\u2019s also open to the public, and all visitors can get an education in SRT\u2019s work. The camp is home to the last free-roaming black rhino population in the world. SRT \u201ctrackers\u201d monitor the land as well as the health of the rhinos, working to ensure they don\u2019t get poached. It\u2019s a job they\u2019ve been doing there since 1982.\n\nNamibian Safari Experience To follow in Behati Prinsloo\u2019s footsteps, visit these areas, which offer luxury accommodations.

One has to do with the belief\u2014largely in China and Vietnam\u2014that rhino horns have medicinal qualities, curing everything from headaches to cancer. \u201cThat\u2019s been proven not to be true,\u201d Mauney says. In addition, some illegal horn traders participate in what\u2019s called \u201cgambling on extinction,\u201d meaning they keep pieces of endangered animals in case that breed becomes extinct, and as a result, the pieces rise in value.\n\nToday there are fewer than 5,000 black rhinos left in the wild, and with epidemic poaching across Africa, \u201cthe critically endangered black rhinos\u2019 last stand may be in northwestern Namibia,\u201d SRT says. But there is some promising news, too: \u201cThis past year has been a very good year,\u201d Mauney adds. At Desert Rhino Camp alone, \u201cwe\u2019ve had 22 births, and we\u2019ve gone nearly two years without a poaching.\u201d\n\nMuch of that success at Desert Rhino Camp can be traced back to the trackers, each of whom spends 21 days a month tracking, covering 28 miles a day. Prinsloo says following them around was one of the most eye-opening experiences of her trip.\n\nBut her entire experience at the camp was magical, she says, from the moment her plane\u2014which traveled from the capital city of Windhoek to Desert Rhino Camp\u2014landed on the dirt tarmac. The plane had to wait to land until animals had left. \u201cIt was all very National Geographic,\u201d she says.\n\nPhotograph by Hugh Lippe\n\nThe terrain that Prinsloo, Mauney, and the trackers crossed was rocky and rugged (\u201cIt looks like Mars,\u201d Prinsloo says) and incredibly hot. Namibia has also been experiencing seven years of drought, Mauney says, with this year being particularly trying. In fact, water is so scarce at Desert Rhino Camp that when taking a shower, guests are asked to keep a bucket beside them to catch the cold water that runs before it turns warm, so it can be reused. The eco-friendly camp forbids plastic; glass bottles are used for drinking water.\n\nPrinsloo and her guests stayed in accommodations she described as \u201cglamping.\u201d The tents each have an en-suite bathroom with a shower and a toilet, as well as \u201ca comfortable bed, lovely linens, and a porch out front,\u201d Mauney says. It\u2019s enchanting, but also very basic. \u201cThere\u2019s no spa,\u201d Prinsloo jokes. \u201cHere, it\u2019s about the rhinos, and they really educate you on that.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a near-100% chance of seeing rhinos at the camp, and Prinsloo also spotted hyenas and oryxes. \u201cI was overwhelmed by it all,\u201d says Prinsloo, referring both to the majesty of the animals and the urgency of the work needed to keep them thriving. \u201cSo many times I just wanted to cry my eyes out.\u201d\n\nNow, she wants to transfer her knowledge of SRT\u2019s work to her fans, posting about the cause on her social-media platforms, appearing on talk shows to discuss the mission, and educating young people in countries that lead the market for rhino horns. \u201cMany people are doing life-saving things for the environment, and they don\u2019t have the platform or the means to get their message out there.\u201d\n\nPrinsloo also appreciates how crucial a healthy wildlife population is to the country\u2019s economic well-being, by way of its tourism. Getting to travel to her homeland through her conservation efforts is icing on the cake. \u201cAfrica,\u201d she says, \u201cis so ancient, and has so many stories, you feel it when you stand on the ground there. You feel connected and part of the circle of life.\u201d", "description": "The model-turned-entrepreneur is on a mission to save Namibia\u2019s rhinos", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter", "Behati Prinsloo"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-101360/social", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
