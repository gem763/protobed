Pole vaulting eventually eclipsed his childhood dream of playing in the Little League World Series like his older brother.\n\nNO REGRETS\n\nDuplantis would spend his summers in Sweden, visiting his mother\u2019s family and competing in local athletics meets.\n\nIn 2015 he chose to represent Sweden instead of the United States at the under-18 world championships.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that big of a deal at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI was jumping 5.25m or something, so I guess people didn\u2019t care quite as much.\n\n\u201cSweden and track and field always went together in my heart,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked back. I don\u2019t regret that decision.\u201d\n\nOn the track, Duplantis has developed friendships with his rivals, including world-record holder Renaud Lavillenie and Sam Kendricks, the 2016 Olympic bronze medalist. This summer he traveled to France to train with Lavillenie.\n\n\u201cWe found this balance between having respect for each other when we are on the track and then kind of being friends and rivals,\u201d Duplantis said of their camaraderie.\n\n\u201cThat being said, we want to win, we want to beat each other despite how happy we look toward each other on the track.\u201d\n\nGreg Duplantis says the nature of the discipline, which includes traveling with cumbersome equipment and setting up high bars, inevitably unites pole vaulters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to do it by yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a pole vaulter has a problem with his or her pole, they call each other and say, \u2018I\u2019m having a problem, can you help me.\u2019 That\u2019s the pole vault ethic.\u201d", "description": "Teenager Armand Duplantis is near the pinnacle of the pole vaulting world but the reigning European champion says he would not be where he is without it being a family affair.", "authors": ["Gabrielle T\u00e9trault-Farber", "Gene Cherry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
