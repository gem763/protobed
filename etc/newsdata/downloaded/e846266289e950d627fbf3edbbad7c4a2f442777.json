Congress refused to seat the winner of the 2018 midterm election between Republican Mark Harris and Democrat Dan McCready and a special election was held this month to replace him. Though Republican Dan Bishop managed to win the heavily Republican district last week, the history of \"cheating\" by the previous candidate weighed heavily, making the race far closer than one might expect in a district with an R+8 partisan lean.\n\nBALLOT HARVESTING BOUNTY: HOW DEMS APPARENTLY USED ELECTION LAW CHANGE TO ROUT CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS\n\nIn California, by contrast, ballot harvesting was legalized by Democrats in the state legislature. They don't consider it cheating in that state. It was used to flip seven Republican seats to the Democratic column in 2018.\n\nDemocrats have long dismissed claims that mail-in ballots are vulnerable to manipulation, pointing to what they call a dearth of voter fraud convictions. Nonetheless, they could hardly ignore the North Carolina race in which a Republican campaign operative illegally collecting ballots allegedly destroyed as many as a thousand ballots supporting the Democratic candidate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe process of ballot harvesting should be illegal for very good reason. It violates the chain of custody, exposing the ballot to potential manipulation by campaign operatives or nonprofit political groups. They could harass voters to turn in ballots, \u201cassist\u201d them in filling them out, and potentially \u201close\u201d ballots that don\u2019t support the candidate the ballot harvester is paid to help.\n\nThe indication that ballot harvesting made the difference in California can be found in the vote proportions. Studies of absentee voters have consistently shown they tend to reflect the population or lean slightly to the right. But when ballot harvesting was deployed in California, we saw late ballots break heavily for Democrats.\n\nElection security is more than Russian hackers trying to change votes. We must secure the chain of custody of ballots, validate the identity of the voter, and maintain updated voter lists. Thus far, Democrats have shown no interest in any of that.\n\nTake, for example, the race between former Republican Rep. David Valadao and Democrat T. J. Cox in California\u2019s rural 21st district. When polls closed, Valadao led Cox by 6,000 votes \u2014 or 8 percent. That margin was wide enough for media outlets to call the race for Valadao.\n\nHowever, late ballots delivered by third-party groups broke so heavily for Cox that he ultimately eked out an 843-vote victory. The results after ballot harvesting were very different from the polling before the race and since. In a July 2019 NRCC survey, Cox was polling at just 36 percent, while 52 percent said they would support \"a potential Republican challenger.\" Valadao has since filed for a rematch.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that elsewhere in the state, Orange County voters on election night 2018 were calling the registrar\u2019s office asking if it was legitimate for someone to come to their door and ask if they could take their ballot.\n\nWho was coming to the door? According to a January 2019 Los Angeles Times story, illegal Dreamers were deeply engaged in the process \u2014 not just delivering ballots, but helping voters fill them out.\n\nThe Times reports on the experience of one Dreamer, Gabriela Cruz, who \u201cfound\u201d a voter smoking a cigarette on a tattered old couch behind a group home hours before election day. He politely tried to wave her off until she \"reminded him\" he had a right that she as an immigrant without citizenship didn\u2019t have. Half an hour later, she was helping the voter lookup candidates as he filled out his ballot by the light of her phone.\n\nWhat are the implications of activists with an agenda \u201chelping\u201d voters look up candidates and fill out ballots? How many of those activists are willing to turn in a ballot that doesn\u2019t help their cause? Should we be exposing people\u2019s ballots to that kind of temptation?\n\nElection security is more than Russian hackers trying to change votes. We must secure the chain of custody of ballots, validate the identity of the voter, and maintain updated voter lists. Thus far, Democrats have shown no interest in any of that.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDon't be fooled by cries for the Senate to pass so-called \"election security\" measures coming from the House. These measures are designed to enforce less secure voting processes on local communities, including the very vulnerable mail-in ballot. They are not about election security. They are about election manipulation in 2020.\n\nIf we want to get serious about securing our elections, state and local lawmakers and election officials must crackdown on the practice of ballot harvesting. Otherwise, Democrats will use it to manipulate the results of the 2020 elections.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON CHAFFETZ", "description": "If we want to get serious about securing our elections, state and local lawmakers and election officials must crack down on the practice of ballot harvesting.", "authors": ["Jason Chaffetz", "Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah.
