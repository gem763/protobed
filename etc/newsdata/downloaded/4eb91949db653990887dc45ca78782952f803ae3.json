We take on one of the best teams in the world, Ireland. The challenge is huge,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cWe understand what tier-one teams are doing when they play tier-two sides, and the challenge for us is to make sure that we make life as difficult for Ireland and to score as many tries as we can.\u201d", "description": "Returning flyhalf Johnny Sexton reckons it may be a blessing in disguise that Ireland's World Cup slipup came in the pool stages as they chase a bonus point win over Russia on Thursday.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435818184&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902AY", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
