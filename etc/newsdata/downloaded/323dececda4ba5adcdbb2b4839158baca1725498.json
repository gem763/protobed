And, it occasionally wags just to say hello. It's a comforting communication that warms your heart the way animals do,' Explained Yukai Engineering.\n\n'Begin your 'tail therapy' today and wrap yourself with fuzzy love.'\n\nThe device first came to life in a Kickstarter campaign where it raised roughly $120,000 (12.3 million yen).\n\nThe firm shipped out more than 900 devices to backers of the campaign.\n\nIt was first revealed to the world at this year's Berlin-based trade show IFA 2019 and has since sold over 10,000 units, reports AV Club.\n\nThe Japanese firm has put its effort into designing a life-like tail that moves and acts like that of a real animal.\n\n'Through trial and error, we developed a mechanism that closely mimics the flexible and elegant movements of an animal,' reads the Kickstarter page.\n\nQoobo was designed by Yukai Engineering in Japan, which makes a range of 'communication robots' \u2013 all of which are designed to connect people with others and their own emotions\n\n'We selected different materials for various parts of the robot to enhance the movements and the tail's appearance. We also made it durable to allow for use in various environments.'\n\nA Qoobo costs about $120 (12,960 yen) and comes in two colors, husky gray and French brown -- and can be found on Amazon.\n\nThe creators conducted a study with 38 participants to see if the robot can do more than just entertain its users.\n\nEach subject went through a psychological evaluation before and after using a Qoobo.\n\nThe purpose of this robotic creature is to soothe owners, as it has been confirmed in three psychological evaluations to ease anxiety, depression and feelings of fatigue\n\nDuring the experiment, Yukai Engineering measured the normal state and the stage after the state after psychological stress on the three evaluation scales of the subject's current psychological state, pulsation, and salivary amylase activity.\n\nThey also looked at these factors before and after a subject used a Qoobo.\n\nAfter analyzing the 35 questions given to each subject, the team found the robot reduced 'Tension / Anxiety', 'Depression / Depression', 'Fatigue / Apathy' Reduction'.", "description": "This headless, cat-like robotic pillow may look frightening, but its sole purpose is to keep you calm.
