They said: \u201cI\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d She has not been heard from since, a family representative told the Guardian.\n\nSeveral other families said that their loved ones had travelled via China to Europe, aiming to reach the UK, and that they had also been out of contact since early Wednesday morning, when the victims\u2019 bodies were found in the trailer after being ferried from Belgium to Britain.\n\n24 hours after police had said that the victims were all believed to be Chinese, the heartbreaking Vietnamese accounts provided the first evidence of who may have been trapped in the trailer, contradicting earlier information. It is understood that some of the missing Vietnamese people may have been travelling using false Chinese passports.\n\nOn Friday Essex police backtracked on its initial claim, with the deputy chief constable Pippa Mills telling reporters: \u201cWe gave an initial steer on Thursday on nationality. However, this is now a developing picture.\u201d She said she would give no further information until a coroner approved formal identification processes.\n\nThe news came on a day of rapid developments in the investigation, with three new arrests in England and details emerging of security processes at the Belgian port where the trailer began the final leg of its journey.\n\nA man and a woman from Warrington, both 38, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and 39 counts of manslaughter, following raids at addresses in Cheshire on Friday morning. A 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland was later arrested at Stansted airport on suspicion of the same offences. The 25-year-old driver of the lorry, Mo Robinson, was still in custody.\n\nIn Vietnam, families responded to press reports of the identification of the victims as Chinese by taking to social media and contacting the country\u2019s embassy in the UK with requests for help. It is believed that there are at least six families who fear their loved ones could have died in the container.\n\nOne of the victims is believed to be Pham. Releasing her last text message, her family said they were desperately seeking information and trying to verify whether she was one of those who had died.\n\nIn the message to her mother, feared to have been sent in her final moments, Pham wrote that she was struggling to breathe and apologised.\n\nPeople-smuggling checks at UK ports inadequate, hauliers say Read more\n\nThe message, translated into English by a family acquaintance, was received at 4.28am on Wednesday morning in Vietnam, a screenshot shows. This would have been 10.28pm UK time, when the trailer carrying the victims would have been in transit \u2013 and just four hours before the ambulance was called and the bodies were discovered.\n\nIn messages from an account titled \u201cdaughter\u201d, Pham wrote: \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn\u2019t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I\u2019m dying because I can\u2019t breathe ... I\u2019m from Nghen, Can Loc, Ha Tinh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mum.\u201d One message has been blanked out because it mentioned the family\u2019s address.\n\nThe screenshot also shows that Pham has not accessed the account since Wednesday. She had previously told her family not to call her because the people taking her to the UK had forbidden calls.\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC reported that Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, was also feared to be among the 39 victims.\n\nThree of the families, all with missing sons \u2013 one born in 2004 \u2013 had been sent word that their loved ones would shortly arrive in Britain. \u201cThey said they received information that their family members were about to reach the UK on 23 October, that they should be prepared to pay. But then the contact disappeared,\u201d Hoa Nghiem, a coordinator at Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said.\n\nIt was also reported that two other Vietnamese families have relatives missing: a 26-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman.\n\nThe 19-year-old\u2019s brother told the BBC she called him early on Tuesday to say she was getting into a container and would be switching her phone off to avoid detection. They have not heard from her since and the people smugglers have since returned money to the family. Relatives of the 26-year-old, with whom she was travelling, have also been given some money back.\n\nThe Vietnamese embassy in London confirmed it had contacted police to seek further information. A spokesman said it had been contacted by a family in Vietnam who claimed their daughter had been missing since the lorry was found.\n\nThe BBC later reported that Pham\u2019s family had to pay \u00a330,000 to traffickers for her journey to the UK. A family acquaintance confirmed to the Guardian that Pham\u2019s family had to remortgage their home to pay the sum.\n\nTrafficked migrants are rarely on any kind of formal manifesto and victims\u2019 families may in some cases be in danger themselves if they acknowledge their disappearance. They may also fear that by going public they will put their loved one at risk of arrest if they are in fact still alive.\n\nEssex police urged anyone who thinks their friends or relatives may have been in the trailer to contact them \u2013 even individuals who may be \u201cliving illegally in this country\u201d.\n\n\u201cPlease come forward and speak to us without fear,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI can assure you that your information will be received in strictest confidence and no criminal action will be taken against you.\u201d\n\nMimi Vu, a leading expert on trafficking of Vietnamese young people to Europe and the UK, said the texts appeared to be authentic. \u201cShe writes her name and where she is from, which is very important, to tell people where she should be buried. It is important for the body to be returned to the place of birth,\u201d said Vu, who has been working in Vietnam on trafficking and slavery issues for the past seven years. She noted that occasionally people were given false Chinese passports if they were trafficked through China, which could lead to confusion.\n\nFollowing Pham\u2019s disappearance, her brother posted a message on a forum regularly used by Vietnamese people looking for missing relatives.\n\nHe wrote that Pham, who lived in the Nghen township in Can Loc district, left the rural province of Ha Tinh in northern Vietnam on 3 October before travelling to the capital, Hanoi, to \u201cfinalise her papers to go China\u201d.\n\nShe then flew to France and on to the UK, he said. However, she was allegedly arrested on arrival in the UK before being sent back to France.\n\nIn the post, her brother added: \u201cShe was arrested a few days ago by UK police and they returned her to France. Now we heard that she might have died. I am posting to ask for her whereabouts and if you tell me your projection about her situation.\u201d\n\nNghiem said she had spoken with a lawyer who was trying to help the family.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe girl\u2019s family got in touch with the lawyer \u2013 who has dealt with cases like this before \u2013 asking if she could help. They are desperate for any information about their daughter.\u201d", "description": "39 people found dead in refrigerated lorry in Essex were initially believed to be Chinese", "authors": ["Nazia Parveen", "Amelia Gentleman", "Jamie Grierson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5cb98c768d3c677214f19c14405f0401e5abd7/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e190633017b962827c8baf7ae1d3b88f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
