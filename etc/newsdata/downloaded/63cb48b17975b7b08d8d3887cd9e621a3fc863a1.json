All his beer went off overnight.\n\n\"Since then nobody, myself included, has dared to risk it again.\u201d\n\n(Image: Nottingham Post)\n\nAlongside Rosie there are tales of three former landlords, all called John, who died in the pub and are said to haunt it.\n\nOne is said to have hung himself upstairs, one accidentally poisoned himself and his family when he prepared a meal after handling rat poison (he died but his family survived), and one fell down the cellar steps and broke his neck.\n\nOf the latter, Jason said: \u201cJohn is fastidious about the cleanliness of the cellar.\n\n\"If it\u2019s not absolutely spotless he slams doors and throws things. My first encounter with him was when I first moved to the pub.\n\n(Image: Nottingham Post)\n\n\"The cellar needed a really good clean, so I\u2019d spent about 18 hours down there sorting it out. I popped upstairs briefly and when I returned there was a really old half pint glass of beer in the middle of the floor.\n\n\"I\u2019m absolutely 100% sure that nobody else had been down there!\n\n\u201cI get on pretty well with John now. I\u2019ve even forgotten to close the cellar door on my way back up into the pub before now and jokingly shouted back \u2018close the door for me John\u2019 and it has slammed shut.\u201d\n\nOther sightings at the pub include a pirate who is said to have fallen into the well and drowned when he was hiding in one of the caves, and a highwayman who can sometimes be seen drinking at the ground floor bar.\n\n(Image: Nottingham Post)\n\nThere are even stories of a legion of Roman soldiers who have been seen emerging from the wall, marching through the cellar and disappearing into the wall on the opposite side.\n\nJason said: \u201cNottingham has always been famous for being haunted and Ye Olde Salutation Inn has plenty of stories for people to hear.\n\n\"We have visits from paranormal investigators and ghost hunters because of the amount of haunted tales associated with the pub.\n\n\"We\u2019re always extremely busy around Halloween as customers hope to catch a glimpse of one of the ghosts.\u201d\n\n(Image: Nottingham Post)\n\nPub company Ei Publican Partnerships chose the spooky pub, which is also one of the odest in Nottingahm, out of more than 4,000 properties.\n\nNick Light, managing director at Ei Publican Partnerships, said: \u201cWe\u2019re extremely lucky to have a number of historic buildings that are home to some very haunting stories and the Ye Olde Salutation Inn has more than most.\n\n\"Many staff and customers have encountered strange goings-on and we\u2019re expecting Halloween to be a particularly spooky evening.\u201d", "description": "Spooky things happen in the Ye Olde Salutation Inn in Nottingham", "authors": ["Lynette Pinchess", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Nottingham Post"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20641671.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_An-historic-Nottingham-pub-has-been-named-as-one-of-the-UKs-most-haunted-watering-holes-with-supern.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
