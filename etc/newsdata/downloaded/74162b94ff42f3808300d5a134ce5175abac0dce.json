He tells RT\u2019s Boom Bust that it \u201cbasically destroys the whole chance of working something out,\u201d adding that \u201cthe Chinese have never bent to this.\u201d\n\nWolff continues: \u201cSo why do it? The answer is: it\u2019s about domestic American politics.\u201d\n\nThe US economist explains that \u201cTrump, in deepening economic and political difficulties, has to have an ongoing drama, up and down, higher tension-lower tension.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is going to keep this going until the moment he thinks it\u2019s correct to cut a deal with China to portray it to the American people, if he can, as a great victory, whatever it really is, and hope that it will help him in the election\u2026 Think of this as a dance to which the Chinese are invited but it\u2019s a dance completely choreographed by Mr. Trump and his drive for re-election,\u201d Wolff added.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section", "description": "Trump needs ongoing drama to finally cut deal with China & portray it as a great victory, Prof. Wolff tells Boom Bust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9db12985f5401d14414d27.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
