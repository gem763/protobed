I'm grumpier than ever - and proud of it!", "language": "en", "text": "Who says we get happier with age? I'm grumpier than ever - and proud of it!\n\nGrump: Michael Winner\n\nA new study for the journal Perspectives On Psychological Science says older people are happier and get more positive as they age.\n\nI read it with utter disbelief. But then, the study was by a psychologist, which means its results are about as reliable as getting a tip on the horses from a gardening expert.\n\n\n\nThe report suggested older minds focus on the positive.\n\n\n\nIt said over-50s are more likely than younger adults to \u2018prune\u2019 their social circle or friends if they find any of their acquaintances \u2018bring them down\u2019. That means they\u2019re going to dump a whole lot of people because they don\u2019t think they\u2019re any use to them any more. An example of the milk of human kindness if ever there was one.\n\nThe basic thought process \u2014 if you can aggrandise it by calling it thought \u2014 behind this extraordinary report is that older people are less grumpy than younger people.\n\nWhat nonsense. I started life grumpy. I became increasingly grumpy with the passage of time. And being grumpy is excellent.\n\nWhat being grumpy means is that, faced with incompetence, inadequacy, stupidity and all the things that are rampant in daily life, you don\u2019t sit there silent \u2014 you let your feelings be known.\n\nIf more people did that, the situation all round might improve. Instead, they take the view that \u2018we mustn\u2019t complain because we will be considered grumpy\u2019. So they shut up and put up with the incompetence, inadequacy and stupidity.\n\nWhat good does that do? I\u2019m delighted to say that as I grow older I become less and less tolerant.\n\nI do not wish to live in a tolerant society. By that, I mean a society that tolerates crime and has criminals put away for either a very short time or given soft treatment while the victims are left to fend for themselves.\n\nMany of the wonderful figures in history who have been grumpy are my heroes. Winston Churchill was extremely grumpy, the more so as he became older.\n\nFamous for his surliness: Former prime minister Winston Churchill became ever-more grumpy as he aged\n\nHe was great at issuing sarcastic remarks. And none was truer than when he said: \u2018A hopeful disposition is not the sole qualification to be a prophet.\u2019\n\nAs I become more grumpy, the person I\u2019m grumpiest about is me. When I make mistakes, however minor, I let forth a stream of expletives of the most vulgar nature directed at myself. I\u2019m less flamboyant regarding other people\u2019s failures, but I see no reason not to point them out.\n\nIn my job as a restaurant critic, I am always to the point. One of my favourite remarks when there\u2019s a minor delay is: \u2018Could you send a search party to the kitchen to see if they can find my main course?\u2019\n\nThe waiter always goes away saying, \u2018What a grumpy old sod\u2019 \u2014 and he\u2019s quite right.\n\nWhy should I not complain? I can think, for example, of few more awful people than restaurant receptionists.\n\nWhen you enter the restaurant hoping to have a nice evening out and be well greeted, the receptionist looks up and says in a surly voice: \u2018Do you have a reservation?\u2019 As if, without a reservation, you are a non-person.\n\nI say, \u2018Go back to receptionist school\u2019, and walk past them.\n\nI\u2019m sure they say to their friends: \u2018We had that terrible old grump Michael Winner in last night.\u2019 If expecting a bit of hospitality from what is laughingly known as the hospitality industry is unreasonable, then I am extremely grumpy and delighted to be so.\n\nI also become very grumpy when things go wrong, such as when I order flowers and they don\u2019t get there, or when people assure me they\u2019re going to turn up on time, but don\u2019t.\n\nMy friend Simon Cowell is the most polite and courteous man ever and greatly believes in good manners. But he is incapable of turning up anywhere on time.\n\nOnce, in Barbados, he came to a restaurant half an hour late and said to me: \u2018On a scale of one to ten, Michael, how angry are you?\u2019 I said: \u2018Well over ten, Simon. It is extremely rude to keep people waiting.\u2019\n\nHis great friend Philip Green remarked in his speech at Simon\u2019s 50th birthday party: \u2018I\u2019ve got him a special present: Big Ben.\u2019\n\nThe point is that I didn\u2019t have the courage to be very grumpy when I was young. Wisdom came upon me with the passage of decades and now I don\u2019t care what anybody thinks about it. Being grumpy simply means you will not stand any nonsense.\n\nThe point is that I didn\u2019t have the courage to be very grumpy when I was young. Wisdom came upon me with the passage of decades and now I don\u2019t care what anybody thinks about it. Being grumpy simply means you will not stand any nonsense.\n\nDuring my years in the film industry, I came across any number of grumps. My friend Robert Mitchum, who I was directing in a movie, was marvellously grumpy. He complained about everything.\n\nReferring to what he thought was a heavy workload, he saw a horse go by and said: \u2018The only difference between that horse and me is he can go to the toilet in the street and nobody minds.\u2019\n\nBurt Lancaster was such a grump that he not infrequently hit people. He tried to kill me three times, yet he was one of my best friends.\n\nBurt became particularly grumpy when anyone tried to take his photograph, be it a professional, a paparazzo or member of the public.\n\nIn Vienna, we were making a movie and Burt was some distance away waiting for his call to action. My assistant said: \u2018Look over there \u2014 Burt\u2019s beating up a member of the public.\u2019 Someone had got through the crowd barrier and stuck a camera in Burt\u2019s face. Burt was slapping him about in full view of thousands of onlookers with cameras.\n\nMarlon Brando could be extremely irritable. Once, in New York, Marlon got so furious that he broke a photographer\u2019s jaw. Burt rang me and said: \u2018Well, your friend Marlon\u2019s done better than me \u2014 he\u2019s inflicted serious bodily harm on one of them.\u2019\n\nExtremely irritable: Winner's pals in the film industry Marlon Brando and Robert Mitchum were so grumpy they would attack people who photographed them\n\nCharlie Bronson could be grumpy. Every day we had to supply him with an American brand of instant coffee called Yuban. My assistant Stephen would make the coffee and bring it to him on the set.\n\nOne day, Charlie turned on Stephen and said: \u2018Stephen, you\u2019re watering down my Yuban coffee.\u2019\n\nWhat benefit could Stephen possibly have got from watering down his coffee? But Charlie loved to have a grumble.\n\nI\u2018m delighted that, as I\u2019ve become older, I put up with less and less. The British hate grumbling. They\u2019re pathetic at it. You get six British people dining in a restaurant. Everything is a disaster. They get the wrong food. Someone doesn\u2019t get served what they ordered at all. Even if it\u2019s right, the food is horrible.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the Maitre \u2018D comes over and says: \u2018How was everything?\u2019 And they all smile, nod their heads and say: \u2018Lovely, lovely.\u2019\n\nThat is a betrayal of what they really believe in. A betrayal of the grumblers\u2019 charter.\n\nWhy are they afraid to make their point? Because the British believe it is bad manners to make a fuss. That\u2019s why they put up with anything and that\u2019s why the country\u2019s in the state it is.\n\nGrumbling should never be well-mannered or under control. It should be full-blooded.
