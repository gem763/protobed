Another video shows what appears to be the same truck dragging a man tied to the back through a street past a large crowd.\n\nOct. 5: National Geographic journalist shot while interviewing purported drug dealer in Mexico\n\n#enPunto, esta noche\n\n\n\nPobladores se llevan por la fuerza al alcalde de Las Margaritas, Chiapas, y lo arrastran amarrado a una camioneta por las calles.
