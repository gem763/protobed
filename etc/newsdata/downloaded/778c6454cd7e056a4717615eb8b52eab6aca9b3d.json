Some users found it particularly notable, given the impeachment proceedings and the song\u2019s chorus:\n\nTake on me (take on me)\n\nTake me on (take on me)\n\nI\u2019ll be gone\n\nIn a day or two\n\nThe video appeared to have been originally published by a pro-Trump Twitter profile called Power Tie, which thanked the president for sharing. The video included cartoon depictions of scenes from Trump\u2019s presidency and an excerpt from his 2017 commencement address at Liberty University.\n\nOne user quickly mashed up the Trump video with the original:\n\nHad to do it. pic.twitter.com/rdrcU0oB9D \u2014 Brandon Wall (@Walldo) October 1, 2019\n\nCheck out some of Twitter\u2019s commentary on the resemblance below:\n\nNorway's a-ha, the latest foreign nationals enlisted to help the Trump campaign. https://t.co/vF0zib65cY \u2014 Tim Long (@mrtimlong) October 1, 2019\n\nWaiting for a cease and desist letter from A-Ha in 3...2...1... \u2014 Dana Goldberg (@DGComedy) October 1, 2019\n\nThings that Donald Trump has tweeted tonight:\n\n\n\n- a weird video of himself that looks like \u201cTake On Me\u201d\n\n\n\n- a Breitbart poll showing that 98% of people support him\n\n\n\n- news footage of himself committing felony witness intimidation\n\n\n\nThis man is in need of immediate medical attention. \u2014 Palmer Report (@PalmerReport) October 1, 2019\n\nThis A-Ha cover is gritty https://t.co/VfXqkrmiud \u2014 Emily Zanotti (@emzanotti) October 1, 2019\n\n@SpeakerPelosi Please add crimes against A-ha to the articles of impeachment. \u2014 Gabe Ort\u00edz (@TUSK81) October 1, 2019\n\nTaaaaaaake on me!
