Curiosity of all curiosities: Trump.\n\nSo the takeaway message from this poll is we love ya, Trump \u2014 but ya gotta go?\n\nOdd. Schizophrenic even.\n\nBut here\u2019s a clue to the mindset of these polled individuals.\n\nQuestion No. 3 states: \u201cI\u2019m going to read you the names of several individuals and groups. Please tell me whether you have a generally favorable or unfavorable opinion of each one. If you\u2019ve never heard of one please just say so.\u201d\n\nTopping the list with a favorability rating of 49% was \u201cThe Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nTrump was second, at 43%. And the rest of the field went this way: Nancy Pelosi, 43%; Hillary Clinton, 41%; Mike Pence, 40%; The Republican Party, 40%; Rudy Giuliani, 31%; Adam Schiff, 27%; Mitch McConnell, 26%; and William Barr, 24%.\n\nSo among the field of nine, Trump led. Add in the Democratic Party, and Trump\u2019s second.\n\nEither the poll\u2019s a bit politically slanted or \u2014 well, not or. It is what it is. The margin of error for subgroups section sheds a bit more light. The poll was conducted by landline and cellphone interviews of 1,003 registered voters, between Oct. 6 and Oct. 8, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nBut the margin of error for blacks and Hispanics was plus or minus 9 percentage points. The margins of error for non-white men and non-white women were plus or minus 8.5 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points, respectively.\n\nAnd on the question \u201cDo you think President Trump should be impeached and removed from office, or not?\u201d \u2014 it was the black, Hispanic, and non-white subgroups who delivered the most decided yays.\n\nFully 76% of black said yes, impeach; along with 64% of Hispanics and 70% of non-whites. Typical Democratic Party voting blocks; typical Democratic Party supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, in yet another show of inconsistency, only 38% of all participants said the economy was getting better, versus 37% who said it was growing worse. Yet in another question, 72% said they were either very or somewhat confident about their own personal financial future.\n\nHow\u2019s that work, in an economy that\u2019s supposedly growing worse?\n\nSchizophrenia.\n\nAll over the map.\n\nAll over the board.\n\nPerhaps the public is truly sick of Trump and wants to see him impeached. But then again: maybe not. After all, in terms of favor, Trump is far ahead of those who are actively working to impeach him.\n\nAccording to the numbers from this poll \u2014 from the actual poll, not the news reports about the poll \u2014 it looks like the public would actually rather see Pelosi and Schiff gone, than Trump. And once again, they still hate Hillary.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
