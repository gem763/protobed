Claiming Bolton practiced \u201cselective amnesia\u201d during their conversation, the Fox News host then said his interview with the now-former national security adviser revealed Bolton was a raging liberal.\n\n\u201cRather than justify or even explain his own record, Bolton brags that he spent a lot of time on the job,\u201d Carlson declared. \u201cIf you are wondering why so many progressives are mourning Bolton\u2019s firing tonight, Bolton himself fundamentally was a man of the left.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was not a human problem John Bolton wasn\u2019t totally convinced could be solved with the elite force of government,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s an assumption of the left. Not the right. Don\u2019t let the mustache fool you. John Bolton was one of the most progressive people in the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, while Carlson was dancing on Bolton\u2019s grave, accusing Democrats of supporting him, and tying the extreme neo-con to the left, he didn\u2019t once mention that Bolton spent over a decade as a Fox News contributor before Trump hired him.", "description": "\u201cThere was not a human problem John Bolton wasn\u2019t totally convinced could be solved with the elite force of government,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an assumption of the left.
