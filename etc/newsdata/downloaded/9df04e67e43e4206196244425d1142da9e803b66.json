The emergency services call centre was 'grossly' understaffed when the toddler died, the inquest at Maidstone Coroner's Court heard.\n\nMrs Atkins performed CPR on little Mia while an ambulance was sent to the home on July 1 last year.\n\nMia was taken to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, where doctors found the paramedics had inserted an endotracheal tube into Mia's oesophagus - instead of her windpipe.\n\nPlacing the tube in the 'wrong place' could have reduced Mia's chance of survival, the court heard.\n\nThere was also claims of a five minute wait for an anaesthetist after a 'miscommunication'.\n\nA scan revealed Mia was brain dead, so Mia's family faced the torturous task of saying their final goodbyes and turning off her life support machine.\n\nCoroner Roger Hatch, who recorded a verdict of misadventure, said it was a 'difficult situation' and Mia's chance of survival had been 'extremely slim'.\n\nMia was taken to Darent Valley Hospital (pictured) in Dartford, Kent, where doctors found the paramedics had inserted an endotracheal tube into Mia's oesophagus - instead of her windpipe\n\nMr Hatch said steps had been taken to prevent it happening again.\n\nHe said after 'unfortunate delays', once dispatched the ambulance arrived with 'commendable speed'.\n\nDuring the final day of the inquest, South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedic James Lyle revealed that numbers of emergency call handlers were 'grossly under the required level' at the time of the tot's death.\n\nMr Lyle has repeatedly recommended improvements since, but said it was tricky to retain call handlers because of the 'high levels of stress.'\n\nSpeaking after the inquest, Beth and Liam said they were 'disappointed by the basic conclusion' and felt some of the findings were inaccurate.\n\nThe parents are now considering legal action.\n\nBeth said: 'It was quite disappointing. It's been a tough year-and-a-half and we thought it was quite a basic conclusion.'\n\nMia was at home in Greenhithe when her aunt noticed she was struggling and started slapping her back.\n\nMs Ranger made several 999 calls but struggled to get through, partly because of problems with the phone signal.\n\nShe performed CPR while waiting for the ambulance but said Mia started 'turning blue' and bleeding from her nose and mouth.\n\nThe inquest was told that after paramedics arrived, information was not correctly passed on between nursing staff at the hospital.\n\nA cardiac arrest call was not put out and there was a delay of five minutes before an anaesthetic doctor attended.\n\nA post-mortem examination gave Mia's cause of death as upper airway obstruction.\n\nThe coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure.", "description": "Mia Atkins, of Greenhithe, Kent, died at Darent Valley Hospital after her parents, who argued that medics made a number of errors which led to her death, switched off her life support machine.", "authors": ["Ed Riley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/17558042-0-image-a-14_1572432735943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
