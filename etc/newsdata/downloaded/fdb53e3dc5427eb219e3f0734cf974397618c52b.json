Poachers kill elephants for their tusks and skin, which are used to make jewelry and traditional medicine, among other things.\n\n\"The big challenge for us in taking care of baby elephants is to keep them alive,\" said Shwe Yi Win Htet, manager at the camp, adding that two young elephants had died in their care.\n\n\"They do not have mothers to feed them and are instead fed with powdered milk. That's why all of us are looking after them very carefully. Our priority is to prolong their lives,\" she said.\n\nOfficials named the four-month-old calf Ayeyar Sein in accordance with the tradition of giving orphans the first name of the state where they are found.\n\nThe young elephant will be raised with the other orphans in the camp after she heals. (Ann Wang/Reuters)\n\nWingabaw elephant camp is a government-owned shelter and 20 elephants rescued from similar situations are currently kept there. Eight are orphaned baby elephants.\n\nAyeyar Sein will be raised with the other orphans in the camp after her injury has healed.\n\nThere are about 1,400 to 2,000 elephants left in the wild in Myanmar, while 5,000 are in captivity, according to a 2018 Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute report, which highlights elephant poaching as an emerging crisis in the Southeast Asian country.", "description": "Baby elephant Ayeyar Sein trumpets impatiently as a vet prepares her milk bottle and walks cautiously, her front left leg in a splint made of bamboo and cloth bandages.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5305462.1570004600!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/myanmar-elephant.jpg"}
