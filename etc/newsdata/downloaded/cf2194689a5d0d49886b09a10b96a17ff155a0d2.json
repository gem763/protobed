The Fed also added new language in its statement noting that U.S. exports have also weakened, underscoring the impact of the trade war on the central bank\u2019s reading of the U.S. economy.\n\nLittle else was changed in the statement beyond the new description of household spending as \u201crising at a strong pace,\u201d reinforcing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s commentary over the past few months highlighting the American consumer as the driving force for a U.S. economy in a \u201cfavorable place.\u201d\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during the \"The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\" panel discussion hosted by the Swiss Institute of International Studies at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland September 6, 2019. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann More\n\nBut a record number of dissents under the Powell-led Fed raises questions about the uniformity of the Fed\u2019s outlook. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard voted for a 50 basis point cut but Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren voted for no change to the benchmark interest rate today. Both George and Rosengren dissented against the July decision as well, also preferring at that time to hold rates steady.\n\nDot plots\n\nThe Fed also released a fresh print of economic projections, and lowered expectations for where rates are headed.\n\nSeven members of the FOMC\u2019s 17 participants see at least one more 25 basis point rate cut by the end of the year. The Fed has two more announcements scheduled this year: October 30 and December 11.\n\nSource: Federal Reserve More\n\nFor comparison, in its June meeting, eight participants predicted one to two rate cuts before the new year. With the Fed now having delivered two rate cuts, policymakers appear to be acknowledging that darker developments since June have warranted a stronger reaction from the central bank than initially thought.\n\nSince the Fed\u2019s last meeting, a whirlwind of economic events have cropped up: the U.S. designated China a currency manipulator, the yield curve inverted for the first time in over 10 years, China and the U.S. ratcheted up their tariffs, and oil prices spiked as geopolitical tensions on the Arabian peninsula flared up.\n\nAll the while, President Donald Trump has continued to criticize the Federal Reserve, lambasting Fed officials as \u201cboneheads\u201d for not paying the \u201clowest rate\u201d in the world.\n\nDespite all the noise, the committee\u2019s economic projections on components of the U.S. economy paint a brighter picture domestically. Policymakers actually increased their projections on U.S. GDP growth, with the median member now projecting GDP growth of 2.2% in 2019, a notch up from the median projection of 2.1% in the last dot plot release in June.\n\nSource: Federal Reserve More", "description": "The Federal Reserve will announce its next moves on rates this afternoon.
