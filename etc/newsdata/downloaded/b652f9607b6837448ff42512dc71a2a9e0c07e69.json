A three- or four-man rush with multiple defenders in a deep zone is generally the prescribed play call in this situation.\n\nInstead, the Dolphins blitzed eight, leaving three helpless defenders in the secondary with no chance of stopping speedy Steelers wide receiver Dionte Johnson when Rudolph found him streaking over the middle for a 45-yard catch-and-run touchdown.\n\n.@Juiceup__3 takes this one in from 45 yards out \ud83d\udca8 pic.twitter.com/hOycSXjvmK \u2014 Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) October 29, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was a bizarre play call from the Dolphins sideline of head coach Brian Flores and defensive coordinator Patrick Graham, and it may have cost Miami a win.\n\nThings fell apart for the Dolphins after an overly aggressive defense gave up a big Steelers touchdown.

Pittsburgh held onto the ball for more than 35 minutes while forcing four Dolphins turnovers on the night.\n\nWide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and running back James Conner starred on offense with Smith-Schuster tallying 103 receiving yards and a touchdown and Conner running for 145 yards and a score.\n\nJames Conner injured\n\nConner walked off the field to the locker late in the game. Head coach Mike Tomlin told reporters after the game that he suffered an AC joint (shoulder) injury, but did not have details on the severity.\n\nThe loss drops the Dolphins to 0-7, while the Steelers improve to 3-4 with the win.\n\nStill spots for wins on Dolphins schedule\n\nAll hope for a win in Miami isn\u2019t loss. They still have two games remaining against the New York Jets and a Week 16 slate with the Cincinnati Bengals that could end up being a battle of winless teams.\n\nBut for any Dolphins faithful who invested in the first half against the Steelers, Monday\u2019s loss amounts to a massive disappointment.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Things fell apart for the Dolphins after an overly aggressive defense gave up a big Steelers touchdown.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FBDA7hEdnT2FUEHW_M3ELg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Pvv.MWlYYNIFRakiBzIE4g--~B/aD0yMDAxO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/dd9a69f0-f9fc-11e9-87eb-8c94c78b5239", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
