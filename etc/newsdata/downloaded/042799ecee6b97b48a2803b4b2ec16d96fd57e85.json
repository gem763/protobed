He dead wrong.\"", "description": "Viewers recognised her 'relatable' reaction saying she's 'going to need counselling for that trauma'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Kuaforumsensintv Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571326.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kuaforum-Sensin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
