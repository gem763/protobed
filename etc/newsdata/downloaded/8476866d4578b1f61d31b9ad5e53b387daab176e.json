The growth was mostly due to a large upturn in seed-stage deals, as well as ongoing development and maturation of international startup markets.\n\nThis seed-stage activity could lead to worldwide venture deal volume hitting new post-Dot Com heights.\n\nVenture dollar volume has been primarily driven by very large, very late-stage rounds, and it remains below the all-time high of a projected $87.4 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Since then, it has flattened out over the past several quarters as unicorns have increasingly looked to public markets.\n\nThe principal driver of this trend is the ongoing decline of China\u2019s venture capital market, mirroring deteriorating economic conditions in that country. Regardless of the cause, the United States and Canada are taking on a greater share of global venture dollars, even as their deal share slips.\n\nNorth American startups raised 47.8% of worldwide venture dollar volume in the third quarter of 2019, up significantly from the 43% proportional share U.S. and Canadian startups called down a year ago.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThis is in contrast to the fact that deal volume is growing faster outside North America. In the third quarter of 2019, U.S. and Canadian companies netted 39.2% of venture deal volume across all stages, down from. 43% in last year\u2019s third quarter.\n\n%Including Series A and Series B rounds - plus transactions from a selection of other round types - the global venture market can attribute roughly 28.3% of its deal volume and roughly 36.8% of dollar volume to early-stage startups.\n\nSeed-stage startups were strong, with deals up 18.5% since last quarter and 17.6% since the third quarter of 2018. Dollar volume is up by similarly growing by 24.2% quarter-over-quarter and 7.7% year-over-year. For early-stage investors worried about issues with future deal-flows, this growth should be encouraging.\n\nOn the one hand, angel and seed-stage deals are a big part of the global venture landscape, accounting for nearly 65% of deal volume, however, because these deals are quite small - typically less than $5 million, they accounted for just 5.9% of total venture dollar volume \u2014 a virtual rounding error when it comes to that metric.\n\nAngel and seed-stage venture exhibits the pattern of geographic divergence that\u2019s present in the market as a whole. U.S. and Canadian startups accounted for 43% of worldwide angel and seed-stage dollar volume in 2019\u2019s third quarter, which is up from 34.7% of global totals from a year ago.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The amount of venture capital deals is increasing while value of deals is declining - what does that trend indicate?", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/index-investing-stock-market-sp-500-5eb109669e23c510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
