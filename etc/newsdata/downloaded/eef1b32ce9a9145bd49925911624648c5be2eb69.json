Magazine if they will have a fourth child, Kimberly said: 'No! I had my tubes clamped while I was in there.'\n\nMax added in an interview: 'I'm having a vasectomy too - we're not taking any chances.\n\n'I'm sure we're going to be together forever but if we did split for whatever reason then Kim couldn't have kids with somebody else, so I shouldn't be able to either.'\n\nOpen and honest: The former Pussycat Dolls singer and her husband Max Rogers welcomed son Ford Senna - a brother for Willow, four, and two-year-old Maple - and she has now revealed during the birth process she was sterilised (pictured in July)\n\nKimberley admitted recovering from the birth has been 'brutal'. She said: 'It's been brutal. I'm a dancer, so the toll it takes being cut in that way is hard.\n\n'We have the most comfortable bed in the world but I can't get out of it as I don't have any core strength, so I've had to sleep on the sofa. Max has been helping me - he does Pilates classes in the lounge.'\n\nThe couple also shared the inspiration behind the unusual moniker they chose for their son, who will be known by his middle name.\n\nHappy family: Kimberly and Max, who married in September 2013 after three and a half years as a couple, are already parents to two girls, Willow, four, and Maple, one (pictured in May)\n\nMax said: 'I've always wanted the name Ford because my big career break was getting the cover of GQ with Tom Ford.\n\n'Then my dad was a racing car driver, and so his middle name is Senna after F1 driver Ayrton Senna.'\n\nKimberly added: 'We had it chosen since before we were married. One sad thing about not having a boy would be we'd never get to use the name.'", "description": "Candidly discussing the choice, Kimberly revealed she had undergone the procedure following her C-section", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/16/20334866-0-image-a-326_1572365885518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
