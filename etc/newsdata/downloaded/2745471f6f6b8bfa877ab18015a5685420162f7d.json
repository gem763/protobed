All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President\u2019s political opponents. We have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\n\nThe McCain family also expressed outrage, as former Sen. John McCain was also featured in the video as a villain along with Sen. Mitt Romney.\n\nReports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage \u2014 Cindy McCain (@cindymccain) October 14, 2019\n\nAlso you\u2019d be screaming bloody murder if something like this was shown at an Adam Schiff or Obama event. So please for God\u2019s sake just stop. This video is disgusting and disturbing and any human with any moral clarity sees that. https://t.co/3jU14QUnDQ \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) October 14, 2019", "description": "The White House on Monday condemned a meme video featuring President Donald Trump defeating fake news after the press reacted in horror.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/meme-of-donald-trump-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
