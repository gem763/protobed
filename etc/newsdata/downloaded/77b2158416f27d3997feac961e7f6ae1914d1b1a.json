They\u2019ll be referred to treatment and counseling.\u201d\n\nYang also took aim at drug companies who have profited from the manufacture and sale of opioids, describing the problem as \u201ccapitalism run amok.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to decriminalize opiates for personal use,\u201d Yang continued. \u201cWe have to let the country know this is not a personal failing, this is a systemic government failing. And then we need to open up safe consumption and injection sites around the country because they save lives.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke, the former representative from Texas, said he agreed with Yang that opioids should be decriminalized, and said that the legalization and prescription of marijuana instead of opioids was also something that should be tried.\n\n\u201cAnyone with drug addiction today is not a problem for the criminal justice system, they are an opportunity for our public health care system,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nThe bulk of the discussion on the opioid crisis, however, was focused on the drug companies who have been held liable for pushing medication on patients who soon became addicted to them.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said she favored jailing executives at companies found to have fueled the crisis.\n\n\u201cThey are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers,\u201d Harris said, adding, \u201cThe eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis.\u201d\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Two Democrats suggested making small amounts of heroin legal as a way to combat the drug epidemic.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0RnFdGmZ8C_qrkizvmjNXQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/3074ec90-efbc-11e9-bfef-45db0794004d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
