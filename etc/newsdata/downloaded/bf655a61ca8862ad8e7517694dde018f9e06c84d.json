But during one such stroll in June 2018, in a quiet residential neighborhood on the south side of Highland Park, N.J., a teenager snatched the bag hanging from her left shoulder.\n\nIt was a recycled-seat belt purse from a now-defunct brand that she calls \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d She grabbed onto the back of the kid\u2019s shirt, but he turned around and shoved her to the sidewalk, where she landed on her right hand. He darted into an old beige sedan waiting on the side of the street, and the car\u2019s driver peeled away.\n\nIn June 2018, in a quiet residential neighborhood on the south side of Highland Park, N.J., a teenager snatched the bag hanging from her left shoulder.\n\n\u201cHe looked young and he looked scared,\u201d Livingston said. She believed she was dealing with amateurs rather than \u201chardened\u201d criminals. \u201cI was frustrated by the whole incident, and I was frustrated with myself, because I thought, \u2018Why wasn\u2019t I paying attention? Why wasn\u2019t I holding on better?\u2019 As if I could have really done anything about it.\u201d\n\nLivingston, who describes herself as a \u201clate adopter,\u201d didn\u2019t own a cell phone at the time. She shared a flip phone with her husband. Cradling her cut hand and reciting the getaway car\u2019s license-plate number, she walked 15 or 20 minutes to the nearby police station and reported the crime.\n\nIn focusing so intently on remembering the license plate, she said, she didn\u2019t note the exact location of the crime.\n\nShe did, however, detail the contents of her stolen purse to police: Her wallet, which contained $60 to $80 in cash, her driver\u2019s license and registration, credit and debit cards, and a key to the safe-deposit box that housed documents like her house deed and marriage certificate.\n\nCourtesy of Amy Livingston 'The lesson is it can happen anywhere,' says Amy Livingston.\n\nThere were keys to her house and her 2011 Honda Fit HMC, +0.11%, as well as miscellaneous items like an address book, a little notebook, a deck of cards, a local map, crossword puzzles, a small flashlight and an umbrella.\n\nUnfortunately, Livingston was also in the habit of carrying around her checkbook \u2014 and happened to be toting her expired passport that day, too, having planned to use it as a secondary form of ID for renewing her driver\u2019s license. \u201cHaving the passport was just unfortunate,\u201d Livingston said.\n\nShe spent about $400 and up to 30 hours in the subsequent days, weeks and months, including buying replacement items, to rectify the situation.\n\nAfter she gave her statement, a detective drove her through town in an attempt to find the scene of the crime. He eventually gave her his card and dropped her off at her house, which she was able to enter with a spare key.\n\nLivingston leapt into action that night, reporting the losses of her credit card, ATM card, passport and driver\u2019s license. She and her husband later headed to the bank, the car dealership to reprogram the keys, and Home Depot HD, -1.51% for new locks.\n\nAs a stopgap anti-theft measure, they bought a \u201cclub\u201d locking device for their car. And since Livingston no longer had a passport to use as a form of identification for obtaining a new driver\u2019s license, she visited her parents in Hopewell, N.J., to retrieve a copy of her birth certificate.\n\nIt took Livingston about a week to replace personal documents she immediately needed, and a couple of months to replace all of the items she had lost. All told, Livingston says she spent about $400 and up to 30 hours in the subsequent days, weeks and months, including buying replacement items, to rectify the situation.\n\nLivingston didn\u2019t need to freeze her credit to prevent fraudsters from opening accounts in her name, having already done so in light of the 2017 Equifax EFX, -0.21% hack that exposed about 147 million people\u2019s personal information.\n\nShe didn\u2019t need to freeze her credit to prevent fraudsters from opening accounts in her name. She already did so after the 2017 Equifax hack.\n\nLivingston purchased an inexpensive Android GOOG, -0.71% GOOGL, -0.72% smartphone, a purchase she had been planning for some time. \u201cI was not going to settle for stuff I liked less than what I had before,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way, they [the robbers] wouldn\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nLivingston says she never imagined she would be the victim of a \u201cstrong-arm robbery with injury,\u201d as police would term the incident, in Highland Park, her home of 15 years.\n\nThe New Jersey borough, located just northeast of New Brunswick, has a property-crime rate of 13.02 per 1,000 people, according to the most recent data available from the safety and security site SafeWise. Its violent-crime rate is far lower, at 0.35 per 1,000 people.\n\n\u201cThe lesson is it can happen anywhere,\u201d she said.\n\nLivingston recounted the experience in a piece for the personal-finance site Money Crashers. One lesson learned: Don\u2019t carry any sensitive documents you don\u2019t need on a regular basis. For instance, she no longer carries a checkbook.\n\nAnd though she suspects the robbers may simply have discarded her purse after extracting the cash inside, she urges anyone in a similar situation to \u201cgo straight into damage-control mode,\u201d reporting the theft and losses of individual items as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cThere were no broader repercussions from this: Nobody broke into our house, nobody broke into our car, nobody got any money out of our bank accounts, nobody charged anything on any of our credit cards,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBecause I acted immediately to control the damage, there was no additional damage.\u201d", "description": "\u2018He looked young and he looked scared.\u2019", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR699_WomanW_ZG_20190919205407.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-20"}
