Medvedev said that Moscow would find ways to help Cuba secure supplies of oil and petroleum products.\n\nA flotilla of shipments from Venezuela gave Cuba some respite this week. But the support from two of its closest allies looks unlikely to resolve Cuba's pressing fuel problems, which have seen the government extend many of the energy-saving measures it has introduced over the past month.\n\n(Reporting by Polina Devitt; editing by William Maclean)", "description": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov has arrived in Caracas to meet Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, the Interfax news agency quoted Borisov's office as saying on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
