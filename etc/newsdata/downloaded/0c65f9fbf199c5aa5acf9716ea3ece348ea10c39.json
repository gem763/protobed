However, in defense of the plane\u2019s design, Muilenburg has raised pilot inaction as a factor in a chain of events that could determine whether pilots successfully troubleshoot to disengage MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) and recover the aircraft.\n\n\u201cIf that kind of scenario occurs and you go through the checklist...it calls out actions that would be taken around power management and pitch management of the airplane,\u201d Muilenburg said in response to a reporter during the company\u2019s annual shareholder event in April.\n\n\u201cIt also refers to the cutout switches, that after an activation that was not pilot-induced, that you would hit the cutout switches,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, in some cases, those procedures were not completely followed.\u201d\n\n\u2018More workload for pilots\u2019\n\nWhile much debate has ensued over whether highly trained pilots would have avoided the fatal crashes, Muilenburg\u2019s statements Wednesday acknowledged investigators\u2019 determination that MCAS software compounded pilots\u2019 emergency troubleshooting environment.\n\n\u201cWhile the investigations have not yet issued their final reports, they have shared preliminary findings,\u201d Muilenburg said. \u201cThe early information established that in both lights, a software function activated in response to incorrect information from an external airplane sensor as part of a broader chain of events that created more workload for the pilots in what was already a high workload environment.\u201d\n\nGrounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are seen parked at Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington, U.S. July 1, 2019.

Thomas Massie (R-KY) whether more experienced pilots would have been able to handle the MCAS-related emergencies, Sullenberger opined that it would have been unlikely they would have performed differently from the crews on the accident flights.\n\n\u201cI'm one of a relatively small group of people who have experienced such a crisis and lived to share what we learned about it. I can tell you firsthand that the startle factor is real. And it's huge. It absolutely interferes with one's ability to quickly analyze the crisis and take an active action,\u201d Sullenberger said.\n\n\u2018Grab the weel, keep it from turning\u2019\n\nStill, former FAA Certification and Regulatory Enforcement Support specialist, Larry Williams, has said any experienced pilot should have been able to handle the Max emergencies.\n\n\u201cYou grab the yoke and pull it back and if you can\u2019t override it you just kick off trim and fly it manually. It\u2019s autopilot disconnect, basically. Push a button on the yoke and disconnect \u2014 grab the wheel, keep it from turning.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the findings, Boeing is altering both how much exterior data the 737 Max intakes, as well as the number of backup systems to recognize when an automatic adjustment of the plane\u2019s nose is in error. After alterations, each Max will be equipped with three redundancies, including two exterior \u201cangle of attack\u201d sensors, instead of one; single automatic activation of the MCAS system, rather than multiple activations; and a pilot override, to stop MCAS from pushing the nose down once a pilot takes control.", "description": "Pilots who were unable to save two separate commercial Boeing 737 Max airplanes from crashes that killed 346 people were exposed to a \u201chigh workload environment,\u201d Boeing\u2019s (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday during an address to the Economic Club of New York in Manhattan.", "authors": ["Alexis Keenan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c53pCZrwPV.m70JyiN_Gug--~B/aD0zMzQzO3c9NDk3NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/6ceb9820-a2cf-11e9-bddf-63b8e4713f8e"}
