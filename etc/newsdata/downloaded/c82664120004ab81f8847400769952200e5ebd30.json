(AP Photo/Matthias Schrader)\n\nSTUTTGART, Germany (AP) \u2014 Everyone counts Simone Biles\u2019 medals except Simone Biles.\n\nWinning her 24th and 25th world championship medals in beam and floor Sunday put the United States gymnast top of the all-time medal charts for the championships.\n\nBiles won five gold medals this week. If she can repeat that at next year\u2019s Olympics it would be a feat no female gymnast has managed at a single Games.\n\nBut for Biles, it\u2019s not about the statistics.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be more thrilled with the performance that I put out at this world championships,\u201d she said. The medal record? \u201cI\u2019m not a number person.\u201d\n\nAged 22, she\u2019s a hero to younger gymnasts who grew up watching her routines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m second in the world after Simone Biles, and she\u2019s obviously so amazing. And to be second is super crazy,\u201d the 16-year-old U.S. gymnast Sunisa Lee said after taking silver behind Biles in Sunday\u2019s floor exercise. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she\u2019s been doing this for so long.\u201d\n\nBiles\u2019 24th medal came on the beam, breaking a tie for 23 with Belarusian gymnast Vitaly Scherbo.\n\nBiles scored 15.066 after a near-flawless routine, opting for a simpler dismount than the double-double she performed earlier in the championships.\n\nThat dismount is a sore point for Biles, who introduced the double-double to competition this season and had the skill officially named after her at the worlds \u2014 there are four Biles skills now. She feels the International Gymnastics Federation didn\u2019t reward it with a high enough difficulty rating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth the one-tenth (extra difficulty point). I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just not,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen her score was announced, guaranteeing the medal record, Biles leaped up from her seat with a broad smile and punched the air.\n\n\u201cI was really excited. I thought it was going to be at least a 14.8, 14.9, but to see 15, I was like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s pretty crazy,\u2019 so I was very proud,\u201d she said.\n\nChina took silver and bronze with Liu Tingting on 14.433 and Li Shijia on 14.3, respectively.\n\nBiles won the floor exercise by a full point, scoring 15.133 despite a step out of bounds on one pass, and blew kisses to the audience after finishing her routine. Her U.S. teammate Lee won silver, her third medal of the championships, while Angelina Melnikova took bronze for Russia.\n\nBiles\u2019 winning routine came after a long wait when Brazilian gymnast Flavia Saraiva requested an inquiry into her score, during which time Biles sat on the edge of the floor.\n\nHer earlier gold medals came in the team event Tuesday, the individual all-around Thursday and the vault Saturday.\n\nA fifth place on uneven bars Saturday ended Biles\u2019 chances of winning a medal in all six events, which she did last year in her comeback world championships after a sabbatical in 2017.\n\nThe uneven bars are historically Biles\u2019 weakest event, though she still won a world silver in 2018, and two-time world champion Nina Derwael of Belgium is the strongest contender to stop a gold-medal sweep by Biles and the U.S. women\u2019s team at the Olympics.\n\nBiles hasn\u2019t confirmed whether she\u2019ll continue to compete after next year\u2019s Olympics, so this week may have been her last at the world championships. Blowing kisses to the crowd wasn\u2019t meant as a goodbye to the competition, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a good floor routine, farewell to just the end of this world championship chapter here in Stuttgart,\u201d she said.\n\nOf her 25 career world medals, 19 are gold, against 12 of 23 for Scherbo.\n\nEarlier, Russia\u2019s Nikita Nagornyy won the men\u2019s vault for his third gold medal of the championships. He\u2019s the first European man to win the vault since 2010.\n\nNagornyy scored an average 14.966 from his two vaults, beating his friend and Russian teammate Artur Dalaloyan into second place. The bronze went to Ukraine\u2019s Igor Radivilov.\n\nThe 38-year-old Romanian Marian Dragulescu, a four-time world champion, secured qualification for his fifth Olympics by placing fourth.\n\nBritain won its second gold of the championships as Joe Fraser scored 15 points to win on parallel bars. Ahmet \u00d6nder was second for Turkey, with Japan\u2019s Kazuma Kaya third. Max Whitlock won Britain\u2019s first gold medal Saturday on pommel horse.\n\nArthur Mariano won gold for Brazil on the high bar, scoring 14.9 ahead of Tin Srbic for Croatia. Dalaloyan took the bronze to end the championships with four medals.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "STUTTGART, Germany (AP) \u2014 Everyone counts Simone Biles' medals except Simone Biles.
