I am looking forward to a good discussion.\u201d\n\nGanguly, who played 113 tests and 311 one-day internationals, helped India emerge from a damaging match-fixing scandal in 2000 and led the side to 21 test wins.\n\nThe former left-handed batsman said there will be \u201cmutual respect\u201d between him and Kohli, who was handed test captaincy abruptly at the start of 2015 when long-serving skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from test cricket midway through a series.\n\nKohli already has more test wins than Dhoni while leading in fewer matches and the world\u2019s top-ranked test side have won 11 consecutive series at home. India also lead the points table for the recently-launched World Test Championship.\n\n\u201cHe (Ganguly) is someone who has played a lot of cricket before, who knows the situation we are in, what the team needs, the requirements of Indian cricket,\u201d Kohli said.\n\n\u201cSo you need a good, professional, high-level discussion. It will be a healthy discussion because I am playing currently and he has played before, there will be a understanding of these things.\n\n\u201cI have had good discussions in the past with him and I expect the same this time.\u201d", "description": "India cricket captain Virat Kohli said on Thursday he expects a healthy and professional discussion with Sourav Ganguly, a day after the newly appointed board chief termed the batting mainstay the \"most important man\" for the game in the country.", "authors": ["Sudipto Ganguly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444460544&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0UE", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
