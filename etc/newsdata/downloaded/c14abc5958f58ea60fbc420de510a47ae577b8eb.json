That includes exiting the handgun category completely, and asking shoppers not to openly carry firearms into its stores \u2014 even in open-carry states.\n\nIn a company-wide email, Walmart said it will discontinue sales of short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber. Those are commonly used in some hunting rifles, but can also be used in large capacity clips on military-style weapons.\n\nIn addition, Walmart said it will completely exit the handgun category by ending the sale of handgun ammunition. It will also end the sale of handguns in Alaska, the last remaining state where they had been available.\n\n\u201cWe know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers, and we hope they will understand. As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same,\u201d CEO Doug McMillon wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cOur remaining assortment will be even more focused on the needs of hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will include long barrel deer rifles and shotguns, much of the ammunition they require, as well as hunting and sporting accessories and apparel.\u201d\n\nIn the email, McMillon estimated that the new actions will reduce the company\u2019s market share of ammunition, from around 20% to a range of 6% to 9%.\n\n\u201cWe believe it will likely drift toward the lower end of that range, over time, given the combination of these changes,\u201d he added.\n\nAsks shoppers not to open carry\n\nThe CEO of the world\u2019s largest retailer also \u201crespectfully\u201d requested that shoppers no longer openly carry firearms into the stores, even in states where the law permits them to do, so unless they are authorized law enforcement officers.\n\nSince the El Paso shooting, McMillon noted that there have been \u201cmultiple incidents\u201d of people trying to make a statement by testing the store\u2019s response to openly carrying weapons. One instance inadvertently caused an evacuation.\n\n\u201cWe believe the opportunity for someone to misinterpret a situation, even in open carry states, could lead to tragic results. We hope that everyone will understand the circumstances that led to this new policy and will respect the concerns of their fellow shoppers and our associates,\u201d McMillon wrote.\n\nAssociates will be briefed on how to communicate this policy change to customers when needed.\n\n\u201cWe will treat law-abiding customers with respect, and we will have a very non-confrontational approach. Our priority is your safety. We will be providing new signage to help communicate this policy in the coming weeks,\u201d McMillon added.\n\nThe policy on concealed carry permits has not changed. McMillon said that Walmart plans to work with other retailers to share best practices around safer gun sales.\n\nWalmart\u2019s responds to gun violence\n\nEL PASO, TX - AUGUST 16: Antonio Basco, who's wife Margie Reckard was one of 22 persons killed by a gunman at a local Walmart, lays flowers in her honor at a makeshift memorial near the scene on August 16, 2019 in El Paso, Texas.

Walmart has made changes in recent years, including ending the sale of modern-sporting rifles, like the AR-15, in 2015. The retailer stopped selling handguns in 1993, except for in Alaska.\n\nThat has intensified since the Aug. 3 shooting of 22 people at an El Paso Walmart. Days earlier, in Southaven, Mississippi, a disgruntled Walmart employee, 39-year-old Martez Tarrell Abram, killed two store associates and injured a police officer.\n\nIn the aftermath of those attacks, Walmart, the world's largest retailer and nation's biggest private employer, has faced pressure to end the sale of firearms altogether. In an open letter to McMillon, New York Times\u2019 Andrew Ross Sorkin called on the CEO to use the company\u2019s clout \u201cto help fix a system that is clearly broken, to solve a crisis whose costs are measured in lives, not just in profits and losses.\u201d", "description": "Walmart (WMT) is proposing bold changes to its gun policy that will end sales of certain weapons, following a deadly mass shooting at one of its stores in El Paso.", "authors": ["Julia La Roche"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZRkwiHGc5b2DSRX8UDunSg--~B/aD0yNTQ4O3c9MzczMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/bc639430-ce57-11e9-bab9-65151935a7c6"}
