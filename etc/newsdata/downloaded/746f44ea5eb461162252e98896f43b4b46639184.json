But with the iPhone 11, Apple was quick to follow suit with its own night mode, which kicks in automatically when snapping photos in low-light situations.\n\nBoth Google\u2019s Pixel phones and the new iPhone are capable of taking clear, crisp photos in the dark. But there are some key differences to take into account.\n\nDuring my testing, I found that the Pixel 4 generally outperformed the iPhone 11 Pro, especially when shooting outdoors at night. That\u2019s not to say the iPhone\u2019s night mode isn\u2019t impressive \u2013 in some cases, it did manage to excel over Google\u2019s Pixel 4.\n\nGoogle announced the Pixel 4 on October 15, which starts at $800 and starts shipping on October 24. Some of the key differences that distinguish it from the Pixel 3 include motion detection powered by Google\u2019s radar technology, an improved camera that now features a dual-lens setup.\n\nRead more: Google just laid out its vision for the future of the smartphone with the Pixel 4 \u2013 here\u2019s how it compares to the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro\n\nApple\u2019s new iPhones also received a major camera upgrade: the Pro models both come with three rear-facing cameras, while the 11 has two. That includes a new ultra-wide-angle lens for capturing broader scenes, which the Pixel 4 lacks.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Google\u2019s new Pixel 4 stacks up against the iPhone 11 Pro when it comes to taking photos in the dark.\n\nPixel 4: Outdoor street from rooftop\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nIn most cases, the Pixel 4 outshone the iPhone when it came to camera performance in low-light circumstances \u2013 especially outside. In this photo, which was taken from my rooftop at night, the lighting in the Pixel 4\u2019s photo was slightly better than that of the iPhone.\n\niPhone 11 Pro: Outdoor street from rooftop\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nAnd here\u2019s the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s image. It\u2019s still crisp and bright enough, but not quite as bright as the Pixel\u2019s.\n\nPixel 4: Night sky\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nGoogle touted the Pixel 4\u2019s ability to take photos of the night sky, and based on my limited testing it appears to be working. I snapped this photo of the sky outside of my apartment in Queens. It\u2019s not easy to see the stars in New York City, but you\u2019ll notice that some are still visible.\n\niPhone 11 Pro: Night sky\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nAnd here\u2019s the same photo taken with the iPhone 11 Pro, where the stars are barely discernible at all.\n\nPixel 4: Outdoor night portrait\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nBoth the Pixel 4 and the iPhone 11 Pro were generally able to take clear, defined portraits outside in dim conditions. But the Pixel 4\u2019s photo was just a bit more luminous and contained sharper details.\n\niPhone 11 Pro: Outdoor night portrait\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nAnd now look at the same portrait taken with the iPhone. It\u2019s still very easy to see the subject, and the lighting is impressive. But you lose a lot of the detail compared to the Pixel 4. The night sky behind the subject is also slightly darker in the iPhone\u2019s image compared to the Pixel\u2019s.\n\nPixel 4: Dark indoor cat portrait\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nThere were a couple of instances in which the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s night mode surpassed the Pixel 4\u2019s Night Sight. The photo of my cat below, which was taken with the Pixel 4, is acceptable considering how dark it was in my living room.\n\niPhone 11 Pro: Dark indoor cat portrait\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nBut the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s image is noticeably brighter. It\u2019s a little fuzzier than the Pixel\u2019s photo, but not enough to detract from the photo. Overall, this image does a better job at portraying the subject.\n\nPixel 4: Dark indoor still life\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nAnd while this image of desk plants taken in a dark conference room with the Pixel 4 looks light and crisp\u2026\n\niPhone 11 Pro: Dark indoor still life\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\n\u2026the iPhone 11 Pro\u2019s version is just as bright, and the colors look bolder.\n\nOverall, both the iPhone\u2019s night mode and the Pixel\u2019s Night Sight represent a big step forward for smartphone photography.\n\nsource Business Insider/Lisa Eadicicco\n\nFeatures like these add a lot of convenience, making it possible to capture quality photos with your phone in circumstances in which it would have been very challenging to do so previously.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to determine a clear winner based on this brief test, especially considering they performed differently as the circumstances varied. But if one takeaway is clear, it\u2019s that the Pixel 4\u2019s camera drastically outperforms the iPhone when it comes to taking photos of the night sky.", "description": "Business Insider - Google's new Pixel 4 and Apple's iPhone 11 are both better at taking photos in the dark.
