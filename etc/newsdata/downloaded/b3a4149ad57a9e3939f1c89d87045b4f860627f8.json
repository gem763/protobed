Last year, he finished the Berlin Marathon just one minute and 39 seconds over.\n\nBut on Saturday, Kipchoge finally did it: He completed the Ineos 1:59 Challenge marathon in Vienna \u2013 an event arranged specifically for his sub-two-hour attempt \u2013 in one hour, 59 minutes, and 40 seconds.\n\nKipchoge\u2019s average mile pace was under four minutes and 34 seconds.\n\nRead more: Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge just became the first person in history to finish a marathon in under 2 hours\n\n\u201cI am the happiest man in the world to be the first human to run under two hours, and I can tell people that no human is limited,\u201d Kipchoge said. \u201cI expect more people all over the world to run under two hours after today.\u201d\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), however, will not be honoring the feat as a world record.\n\nThat\u2019s because Kipchoge had advantages that set this event apart from a traditional marathon, including a phalanx of pacesetters who reduced Kipchoge\u2019s wind resistance, a pace car that used lasers to indicate the best running paths for those pacesetters to take, and a race course that was, essentially, flat.\n\nWhy Kipchoge did not set a world record\n\nKipchoge\u2019s pace through the Saturday marathon was remarkably consistent, and not by accident. He was accompanied at all times by a group of pacesetters \u2013 many Olympians themselves. These fellow runners flanked Kipchoge in front and behind, helping him keep a steady pace and forming a human shield against wind.\n\nThe formation of these pacesetters, five in a V-shape ahead of Kipchoge and two at his heels, was meant to minimize wind resistance, the IAAF\u2019s Bob Ramsak reported.\n\n\u201cThe pacemakers did a great job \u2013 they are among the best runners of all time,\u201d Kipchoge said. \u201cI thank them and appreciate them for accepting to do the job.\u201d\n\nBut the members of this mobile shield rotated during the course to ensure they could keep pushing Kipchoge to the edge of his endurance limits \u2013 and IAAF rules forbid pacesetters from hopping in midway through a race.\n\ncaption Kipchoge was surrounded by pacesetters during his marathon in Vienna. source BBC Sport\n\nAdditionally, Kipchoge and his pacesetters were helped by an electric car that drove just ahead of them. The vehicle showed Kipchoge his current time and also came equipped with laser beams that projected the ideal running positions for his pacesetters on the road.\n\nThe Economist reported that, according to an estimate by the sports scientist Ross Tucker, Kipchoge gained two minutes thanks to his pacesetters and the car. Given that Kipchoge finished the race just 20 seconds under two hours, those were crucial minutes.\n\nAlso, the IAAF doesn\u2019t consider the Ineos 1:59 Challenge event a real race, as it was tailor-made for Kipchoge\u2019s sub-two-hour marathon attempt. No competitors joined Kipchoge on the course, the IAAF\u2019s president, Sebastian Coe, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t sanctioned as a world record because it wasn\u2019t in open competition,\u201d he said.\n\nEvent organizers created ideal conditions for Kipchoge\u2019s marathon attempt\n\nThe course in Vienna was chosen specifically to help Kipchoge attempt a sub-two-hour marathon. There were just 2.4 meters of incline over the route, so he never had to sprint uphill. The event also took place on a 6-mile loop with minimal curves (curves require runners to exert more energy than sprinting in a straight line).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Vienna sits at sea level, so Kipchoge got the maximum amount of oxygen possible.\n\nThe event organizers even tried to maximize how conducive the weather would be to Kipchoge\u2019s success: Meteorology and performance experts determined that the optimal start date for the run would be Saturday. That\u2019s when the city\u2019s temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation forecasts were optimal, Robby Ketchell, who led Ineos\u2019 weather analysis, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cFor the Challenge, we need a 24-hour window of no rain to keep all the surfaces dry,\u201d Ketchell added.\n\ncaption Kipchoge in Vienna on Saturday. source REUTERS / Leonhard Foeger\n\nPlus, Ineos-sponsored runners and cyclists passed Kipchoge unlimited drinks and energy gels every 5 kilometers or so.\n\nAnd finally, according to the Economist, Kipchoge also wore a never-before-seen version of Nike\u2019s Vaporfly shoes. The sneakers, which aren\u2019t on the market yet, feature carbon-fiber plates in the sole to help runners get the most forward push for each stride. A February 2019 study done by researchers unaffiliated with Nike found that the shoes improved runners\u2019 energy efficiency by 4% compared with other sneakers.\n\nA \u2018man on the moon\u2019 moment\n\nKipchoge\u2019s Berlin marathon time of two hours, one minute, and 39 seconds is already the world record.\n\nBut for him, this sub-two-hour marathon wasn\u2019t about breaking another record \u2013 the IAAF made it clear well ahead of time that the event results wouldn\u2019t be sanctioned. Instead, Kipchoge saw the athletic achievement as akin to Neil Armstrong\u2019s first step onto the lunar surface in 1969.\n\nKipchoge said on Thursday (before the race) that the feat would be \u201cmaking history in this world, like the first man to go to the moon.\u201d\n\ncaption Kipchoge crossing the finish line. source BBC Sport\n\nAfter he finished the race, Kipchoge hugged his wife and his daughter at the finish line.\n\n\u201cThat was the best moment of my life,\u201d he said.", "description": "Business Insider - On Saturday, the Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge ran the first sub-two-hour marathon.
