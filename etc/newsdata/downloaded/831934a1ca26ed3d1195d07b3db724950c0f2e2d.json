You immediately owe more money than the car is worth.\n\nAccording to NerdWallet, that\u2019s called being \u201cunderwater\u201d or upside down. For this reason, car buyers should go for the shortest car loan they can pay for.\n\n\u201cThe shorter the loan length, the quicker the equity buildup in your car,\u201d Jesse Toprak, CEO of CarHub.com told the website.\n\n2. You\u2019re setting yourself up for a negative equity cycle.\n\nIf you have to trade in your car before the long term loan is paid off, you could still owe money, which could end up being added into your next loan -- which will increase your debt every time it happens.\n\n3. After 60 months, interest rates tend to jump.\n\nEdmunds analyst Jeremy Acevedo told NerdWallet that people who stretch their loans longer than 60 months end up paying higher interest. That shows they are either buying a more expensive car or are paying more for the same car, NerdWallet reported.\n\n4. If you have a long term car loan on a used car, you\u2019re going to be paying more for repairs, too.\n\nAn older car will have more miles on it and will need plenty of maintenance and potentially unexpected repairs. That means you could be spending a lot more on your car than just the payments.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAccording to NerdWallet, there are four things you can do to fix some of the issues you might have with long term loans.\n\nThe website recommends using low APR loans, refinancing your bad loan, making a larger down payment or leasing the car instead of buying it.", "description": "Here's why you should say no to a long term car loan, according to NerdWallet.", "authors": ["Ann Schmidt"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/car-loans-grab.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
