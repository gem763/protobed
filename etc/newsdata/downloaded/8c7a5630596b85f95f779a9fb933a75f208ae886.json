In the show she was engaged, and she had a ring on. We were about to get out of the car and I said: \u2018Don\u2019t get out. Give us the ring. There\u2019s a paparazzo down the street. If a photograph got out with you with a ring on it, it would explode all over the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nPierce said that he had not seen Markle since filming ended. \u201cWhen we had the final scenes I said: \u2018Listen, your world is going to be forever changed, and no matter where you are, you can always know that you have a friend in me. That was the last time I got to speak to her \u2013 and it was great.\u201d\n\nPierce, who is known for his role as Detective \u201cBunk\u201d Moreland in The Wire, is currently starring in Death of a Salesman in the West End. He was born during the civil rights movement in New Orleans. His father was a second world war veteran and his mother was a teacher. The family home was flooded during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a devastation he described as \u201cvery painful\u201d and much like \u201closing a member of a family\u201d.\n\nPierce said the trauma for his parents was unbearable. \u201cI have seen my parents in grief once before when my older brother died. He died about five years before. I saw them just become these diminutive fragile souls. And then I saw it again that day when I brought them to the house.\u201d Pierce rebuilt it from the inside out. \u201cI knew that if I demolished the home it probably would demolish them.\u201d", "description": "Wendell Pierce, the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s co-star on the legal drama Suits, feared for her privacy after her engagement", "authors": ["Nosheen Iqbal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca27bce7e50cacb9a3d6581ed9f532978670f7b4/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e380a84b837cf5d5c050027ab191545", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
