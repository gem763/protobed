Borne from a need expressed by customers within regulated industries to ensure compliance in their social media communications, the latest innovation from Hootsuite and Proofpoint is focused on providing peace of mind and ease of use across all channels.\n\n\n\n\u201cDriving this kind of customer-focused innovation is integral to delivering on our promise of helping customers strategically grow their brands, businesses, and customer relationships with social,\u201d said Ryan Donovan, SVP of Product and Technology at Hootsuite. \u201cThis feature will put up the guardrails, and give our customers in regulated industries the confidence to empower their people to capitalize on the power of social media to achieve their business objectives, particularly around social selling.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith this feature, social media posts created within Hootsuite\u2019s new compose platform will be automatically screened. As users compose social media messages, they are alerted in real time, while they type, to common compliance policy violations. In the event of violations, the ability to post is automatically disabled until the user fixes the errors. This provides real-time guidance with clear instructions similar to how a spell checker works, providing a much better experience for users as they can learn and correct common compliance mistakes, rather than trying to publish and having their content rejected.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdvanced, real-time social media compliance functionality is a critical need for all organizations that operate in regulated industries,\u201d said Dan Nadir, VP of Digital Risk and Compliance Solutions for Proofpoint. \u201cIn partnership with Hootsuite, our predictive compliance feature educates regulated users on compliance policies and eliminates the need for supervisors to review messages manually. It will create efficiencies for organizations in regulated industries who can now leverage all of the advantages of social media.\u201d\n\n\n\nHootsuite Enterprise customers who also subscribe to Proofpoint Social Syndicate can now access the predictive compliance feature within Hootsuite\u2019s industry-leading social suite. Proofpoint Social Syndicate simplifies compliance for digital content sources and publishers across the entire organization.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\nAbout Hootsuite\n\nHootsuite is the most widely used social media management platform, trusted by more than 18 million people and employees at 80% of the Fortune 1000.
