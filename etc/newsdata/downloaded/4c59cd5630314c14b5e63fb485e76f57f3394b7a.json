It's c0-authored by Rob West, whose consultancy Thunder Said Energy maintains a patent database that provides a window into companies' positioning\n\nThe high-level takeaway: So far just 8% of the patents are in what's broadly described as \"new energies,\" including renewables.\n\nThe rest are \"aimed at improving the efficiency of fossil fuels, which indicates that companies remain focused on their traditional activities.\"\n\nBut, but, but: The picture looks somewhat different when you turn to the majors' VC arms. They looked at 200 VC investments by the largest oil companies, and new energies had the second-highest total\n\nOne thing West and OIES director Bassam Fattouh emphasize is that for all the attention renewables and electrification, that won't be nearly enough to decarbonize the energy sector.\n\n\"The [international oil companies] have an opportunity to develop non-electric zero carbon technologies to help fill this gap,\" they note.\n\nThe bottom line: \"IOCs should ramp up on technologies where they see real opportunities and they are in a good position to exploit. But it remains very unclear whether these investments are being pursued as part of a long-term vision or as part of an ad-hoc approach,\" the paper states.\n\nGo deeper: Southern Company CEO Tom Fanning on renewables, cybersecurity and more", "description": "There's growing political, societal and market pressure to cut global emissions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/PfXAlk9QC-5xrXxdMABGF4ZAXdw=/0x0:1116x628/1920x1080/2019/07/03/1562160589995.png", "published_at": "2019-07-03"}
