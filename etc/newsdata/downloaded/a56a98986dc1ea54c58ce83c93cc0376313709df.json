It is divided into 11 \u201crooms,\u201d or sections to showcase various forms of art and prohibits \u201cthe making of speeches and passing out of written communications\u201d in 10 of the rooms, according to the city\u2019s website.\n\nThe restricted area includes \"The Bean,\" a popular tourist attraction, that the college students say is prime real estate for spreading their message. But city rules explicitly prohibit any \u201cconduct that objectively interferes\u201d with patrons and parkgoers ability to enjoy the featured art.\n\nThe plaintiffs -- Matt Swart, Jeremey Chong, Gabriel Emerson and Caeden Hood -- say they were given copies of the new ordinances this past April and stopped gathering at the park. They say the ordinances infringe on their First Amendment right to freedom of speech and religion.\n\nAn attorney for the students sent a letter to the city's commissioner of Cultural Affairs in January and May asking them to \u201cchange these rules to allow the customary vibrant, colorful, energetic and vigorous exchange of ideas that have always characterized America\u2019s best public places,\" but to no avail, The Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe students are now arguing that the park is a public forum and they should be able to congregate and speak freely and distribute free literature without restrictions.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about evangelists,\u201d attorney John Mauck told the newspaper. \u201cThis is for politicians campaigning, political activists and whoever else wants free speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get to this point,\u201d Swart said. \u201cOur desire is simply to share the gospel in the park.\u201d", "description": "Four students at Wheaton College in Illinois\u00a0are accusing the city of Chicago of infringing on their free speech rights, claiming that\u00a0newly implemented rules prohibit them from congregating and handing out religious pamphlets in Millennium Park.", "authors": ["Vandana Rambaran", "Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News", "Politics At Foxnews.Com.
