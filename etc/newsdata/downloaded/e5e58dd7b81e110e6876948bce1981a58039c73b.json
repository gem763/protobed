Hong Kong leader to withdraw controversial bill\n\nCarrie Lam, the head of Hong Kong\u2019s legislative council, will formally withdraw a controversial draft bill that was the initial spark for what has now become over three months of increasingly intense protests.\n\nThe bill, which would have allowed for the extradition of Hong Kong citizens to the Chinese mainland for trial, is to be withdrawn within the next 24 hours, the South China Morning Post reported, followed by Reuters.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t clear from the report whether Lam had either sought or received Beijing\u2019s approval for pulling the bill. Beijing has been massing troops and paramilitary police on the other side of the border in neighboring Shenzhen, and threatened earlier this week that it reserved the right to declare a state of emergency.\n\n2. Sterling surges as Brexit opponents defeat Johnson\n\nSterling rose by more than 0.6% against the and 0.3% against the after lawmakers moved to reduce the risk of a disorderly Brexit.\n\nBritish lawmakers will vote on a bill that would delay the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU until Jan. 31. The bill was made possible by a vote late on Tuesday in which opponents of a \u201cNo-Deal\u201d Brexit wrested control of the parliamentary agenda from the government.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson signaled he will call for a snap general election after losing control of the Brexit process to opponents of a disorderly \u201cno-deal\u201d departure from the European Union. However, for that, he needs the support of two-thirds of lawmakers. After ejecting 21 rebels from his own party benches last night, Johnson no longer has any sort of majority in the House of Commons.\n\nSterling\u2019s gains were capped by the awareness that another general election, which would be the third in four years, would be no guarantee of a decisive majority in parliament for any Brexit outcome.\n\n3. Wall Street set to open higher\n\nU.S. stock markets are indicated to open sharply higher on the back of the Hong Kong news, rebounding after data released on Tuesday suggested that activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector had started to contract in August.\n\nBy 6 AM ET (1000 GMT), and the contract were both up 0.8%, and the contract was up 1.1%.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s stock market rose by the most since 2011, pulling European markets higher with it.\n\nIn addition to the news from Hong Long and London, European and Asian stocks were also helped by purchasing manager surveys showing that services activity remained broadly stable in August, despite the continued weakness of global manufacturing.\n\n4. Bank of Canada, Fed - and others\n\nIt\u2019s a heavy day for central banks worldwide, with Federal Reserve officials rushing to get their views on the record before the pre-FOMC news blackout starts.\n\nFirst up is New York Fed president at 9:25 AM ET, followed by and at separate events at 12:30 PM ET, Minneapolis Fed president at 1 PM and Chicago Fed president at 3:15 PM.\n\nOverseas, ECB president-designate Christine Lagarde is currently answering questions from the European Parliament, while Bank of England head Mark Carney is also due before a U.K. parliamentary committee.\n\nThe will hold its regular policy meeting later.\n\n5. Oil bounces on macro hopes, Saudi export data\n\nThe will release its weekly estimate of stocks at 4:30 PM ET (2030 GMT), against a backdrop of growing fears for global demand due to the escalation of the U.S.-China trade war and the start of hurricane season.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s official data are due Thursday, a day later than usual, owing to the Labor Day holiday.\n\nprices, which fell by nearly $2 a barrel on Tuesday, have recovered around half of those losses overnight, helped in part by the boost to risk sentiment from the news in Hong Kong and the U.K. By 6 AM, the U.S. benchmark blend WTI was at $54.24 a barrel, while the international benchmark was at $54.48.\n\nAdditional support came from official data showing that Saudi Arabian crude exports fell to a 22-month low of 6.72 million barrels a day in August, allaying some fears that the OPEC+ group of producers may be losing its discipline.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Wednesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB2J0VD_L.jpg"}
