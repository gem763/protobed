NBA Commissioner Adam Silver attends the pre-match news conference. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nRockets general manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for any hurt caused by the tweet, which he quickly deleted over the weekend.\n\nBut China\u2019s government, fans and the team\u2019s partners were not mollified, resulting in loss of sponsors and broadcasts in the world\u2019s second-largest economy and an important National Basketball Association (NBA) market.\n\nHowever, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke up for freedom of speech saying it was not up to the NBA to regulate what players, employees and team owners said, nor to adjudicate differences between people around the world.\n\nCCTV state television said it strongly opposed Silver\u2019s support of Morey.\n\nAny comments that challenged a country\u2019s sovereignty and social stability were \u201cnot within the scope of freedom of speech\u201d, CCTV said, adding it was reviewing its relationship with the NBA.\n\nMonths of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong have angered Beijing, which has accused Western governments of stirring up anti-China sentiment. China rejects outside intervention in Hong Kong as interference.\n\nUNDER FIRE AT HOME\n\nThe NBA had earlier issued a statement saying it regretted Morey\u2019s remarks, drawing criticism from U.S. lawmakers.\n\nBut Silver, in Japan for an exhibition game, defended Morey\u2019s right to express his opinions.\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2013 including from America and China \u2013 will have different viewpoints over different issues,\u201d Silver said in a statement. \u201cIt is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\u201d\n\nSilver later told a news conference in Japan, where he is attending an exhibition game, that the NBA was not apologising for Morey \u201cexpressing his freedom of expression\u201d.\n\n\u201cI regret, having communicated directly with many friends in China, that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans,\u201d Silver said.\n\nThe league has worked for years to cultivate the Chinese market and regularly plays exhibition games there. Its top stars, including Rockets guard James Harden, frequently visit to meet fans and take part in promotions with sponsors.\n\n\u201cAs a league we are not willing to compromise those values,\u201d Silver said, referring to freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to our interests here and to our partners who are upset. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\u201d\n\nSilver said the league also supported Brooklyn Nets owner and Alibaba Group (BABA.N) co-founder Joseph Tsai, who issued a lengthy statement criticising Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nCHINA \u2018VERY CLEAR\u2019\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang referred to criticism of Morey\u2019s comment by the Chinese Basketball Association, which he said made China\u2019s position \u201cvery clear\u201d.\n\n\u201cI suggest they pay attention to the reaction of the ordinary Chinese people,\u201d Geng told a regular briefing.\n\nExchanges and cooperation would not work if people failed to understand public opinion and China would take \u201cfirm and powerful measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security\u201d, he said.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s regular season, to which CCTV owns the exclusive Chinese broadcast rights, begins this month.\n\nTech giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK) has exclusive internet streaming rights in China, which media reports have said are worth about $1.58 billion. It has said it would temporarily stop showing Rockets games.\n\nThe decision heaps pressure on the league, which faces criticism on multiple fronts about its handling of the controversy.\n\nIts apology on Sunday had disappointed some who see the league as the most progressive of the U.S. sports organizations. Silver has in the past urged players to speak out on issues of concern at home, including questions of police brutality and gun violence.\n\nTencent said in July that 490 million Chinese fans watched NBA programming on its platforms last season, up threefold since the 2014-2015 season.\n\nA pre-season game between the Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers is set for Thursday in Shanghai, with a rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen. However, organisers abruptly cancelled a Tuesday media event without explanation.\n\nSeveral Chinese celebrities also announced they would not attend an NBA-organised \u201cfans\u2019 night\u201d on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe motherland always stands above everything,\u201d actor and singer Evan Li said in a statement.", "description": "Chinese state television said on Tuesday it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week, heaping pressure on the U.S. basketball league after a tweet by a Houston Rockets executive backing protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Chris Gallagher", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438422377&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9703S", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
