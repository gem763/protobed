No one would break his ribs doing CPR or make bruises bloom along his arms trying to find a vein. As his health-care proxy, I was completely on board. I\u2019d read Sherwin Nuland\u2019s \u201cHow We Die,\u201d Atul Gawande\u2019s \u201cBeing Mortal,\u201d Elisabeth Kubler-Ross\u2019s \u201cOn Death and Dying.\u201d Comfort would be the priority and any pain would be \u201cmanaged,\u201d which I assumed meant erased.\n\nUp to 80 percent of Americans die in hospitals or nursing homes, and a third spend at least 10 days in an intensive care unit before they die, many of them comatose or on a ventilator. A week after his sudden diagnosis of widespread metastatic disease, my father was lucky enough to get a bed in our town\u2019s only hospice, a homey facility staffed with attentive and experienced caregivers. The alternative would have been a hospital bed in my living room, so it was a relief to know that my father was in the hands of professionals. They would know what to do.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd they did. The nurses and caregivers were gentle as they repositioned my father in bed, explaining each move even when it seemed he couldn\u2019t hear or follow. When he could no longer swallow they squirted morphine into his cheek and rubbed it so the medicine would be absorbed. \u201cThis will make you feel better,\u201d they would say, and my father would turn his head and open his chapped lips like a baby bird.\n\nBut his death was not the peaceful drifting away I\u2019d always imagined, where you floated into a calm, morphine-induced sleep, your breath came slower and slower and then simply stopped. He vomited blood over and over. A lifelong stoic who never complained of pain \u2014 even when he\u2019d broken a hip the year before \u2014 he twitched restlessly in bed, eyes closed, his brow furrowed and his skin clammy.\n\nThe magical \u201cmanaging\u201d of pain and nausea I\u2019d anticipated turned out to be more aspirational than real. The hospice nurse prescribed one anti-nausea medication, then another, without success. Eventually, Ativan and Haldol settled the nausea, and morphine helped the pain. My father was lucky it helped; about 25 percent of people die in pain. One caregiver confided to me, \u201cThere are people whose pain we never get under control.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor days we watched my father\u2019s cheeks hollow, watched him pluck at the thin blanket that was all he could bear on his body. His kind brown eyes glazed over, and some trick of the light made them look blue under his half-closed lids. Sometimes he sat up suddenly, reaching forward, and then fell back on the pillows. I knew there was a name for this behavior, terminal restlessness, that it\u2019s common during the dying process. I knew the gurgling sounds he made as he breathed came from his body\u2019s inability to clear secretions, and that \u2014 according to hospice \u2014 it probably wasn\u2019t uncomfortable for him.\n\nLeaving the hospice facility one night, I told my 81-year-old aunt that I wished I had the nerve to put a pillow over his face. \u201cI\u2019ll stand guard at the door while you do,\u201d she replied. Dying is hard work. And it\u2019s hard to watch.\n\nOn the last night, I sat with my father until the summer sky began to darken. Then I gathered my belongings and leaned over the bed where he lay unresponsive, his eyes closed, his mouth half-open. I kissed his stubbled cheek. \u201cDad, I\u2019m going now,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go too.\u201d He died a few hours later. He was alone, as most people are when they die, so I don\u2019t know if it was peaceful, if he made a sound or opened his eyes or just stopped breathing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter he died, I was haunted by scenes of his suffering. I remembered looking out a hospital window nearly 30 years earlier with my newborn daughter in my arms, realizing that every one of the people I saw on the street had been born. For every person walking down Seventh Avenue, a woman had borne pain that tore her body open. It was a horrifying thought.\n\nDrugs help with the pain of childbirth, but they can\u2019t take it away completely. It\u2019s the same with dying.\n\n\u201cSuffering is an ineradicable part of life, [like] fate and death,\u201d wrote psychologist Viktor E. Frankl in his bestseller \u201cMan\u2019s Search for Meaning.\u201d He was something of an expert, having survived nearly three years in a variety of Nazi camps.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, my father\u2019s suffering was nothing like the kind Frankl witnessed. But still, death, like birth, is a creaturely process, a force that wrenches us onward without consulting our preferences or respecting our sensibilities.\n\nAD\n\nIn the weeks after my father\u2019s death, I began to understand in a deeper way the meaning of a good death. No drugs took away all my father\u2019s physical pain and nausea. But in the care he was given, the morphine, the quiet words, the repositioning and cool cloths on his forehead, his suffering was addressed even if it couldn\u2019t be \u201cmanaged.\u201d\n\nAnd that, I think, is what we all want. Not just freedom from beeping machines and needles and the cold lighting of an ICU, though that matters, too. Not just the absence of pain, which isn\u2019t possible for everyone. But the solace of being seen and heard and acknowledged brings comfort even in the face of deep suffering.\n\nAD\n\nI hope it\u2019s something we can remember as we move toward a society where more of us can have a truly good death.\n\nHarriet Brown\u2019s latest book is \u201cShadow Daughter: A Memoir of Estrangement.\u201d She is a professor of magazine, news and digital journalism at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in Syracuse, New York.\n\nWhat is a good death? How my mother planned hers is a good road map for me\n\nChoosing your own exit. For some who are terminally ill, hastening death may be an answer\n\nWhat to know about living wills and other end-of-life issues\n\nAD", "description": "In hospice, the drugs couldn\u2019t take away all my elderly father\u2019s pain and nausea as he was dying.
