Source: Desire Guardiola\n\n\"Please save my baby\"\n\nIt was then that Desire heard a gunshot ring out \u2013 then felt a sharp stabbing pain in her stomach.\n\nShe slumped to the ground in agony, hoping that someone had called an ambulance.\n\nDesire tried not to panic when she realised she couldn\u2019t feel the baby moving anymore.\n\nOnce the ambulance arrived, she \u201cbegged for them to 'save my baby, to help my baby'\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I remember, I was being wheeled into the emergency room, all eyes were on me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI knew it was serious, I just didn\u2019t know how serious.\u201d\n\nDesire had an emergency C-section to try to save her baby. Source: Desire Guardiola\n\n\"They didn\u2019t expect her to live through the night\"\n\nIt turned out that Desire had actually been shot twice \u2013 once in the left breast and once in her abdomen.\n\nShe was rapidly losing blood around her uterus, so doctors decided to perform an emergency C-section.\n\nBaby Emery had a heartbeat when she was delivered - but was quickly determined to be brain dead.\n\nDesire woke up from surgery to the unbearable news that her baby wasn\u2019t likely to survive.\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw her, she was completely motionless and couldn\u2019t open her eyes, cry, or even breathe on her own,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey knew there was no hope of her surviving or doing anything on her own. They didn\u2019t expect her to live through the night.\"\n\nDesire had to make the decision to turn off Emery's life support. Source: Desire Guardiola\n\n\u201cMy heart was demolished\"\n\nDesire asked for her daughter to be baptised \u2013 knowing that they didn\u2019t have much time.\n\nShe pushed her own recovery to the side in order to focus on Emery.\n\nDoctors were only becoming more certain that the tiny baby wouldn\u2019t be able to survive without machines.\n\n\u201cThis is a decision ultimately up to you. When you do finally say enough is enough, she will be put to rest,\u201d she vividly remembered being told.\n\n\u201cMy heart was already broken into a million pieces knowing she was hurt and I could never do anything to heal her pain or make her better.\n\n\u201cMy heart was demolished. I felt so confused and hurt and angry.\n\n\u201cHowever, what one doctor said stuck with me: 'this is a decision you make out of love'.\u201d\n\nDesire held her daughter as they said goodbye. Source: Desire Guardiola\n\n\u201cI held her through each breath she took\"\n\nDesire knew that if the decision was just about her \u2013 she would have kept Emery with her forever.\n\nBut she also knew it wasn\u2019t fair to prolong her daughter\u2019s suffering.\n\n\u201cI knew I should let her go and be free and not continue to suffer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI gave the doctor permission to take her off the tubes.\n\n\u201cI held her through each breath she took.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to so badly put her back on the machine, but once you decide, you decide.\n\n\u201cShe went peacefully in my arms. I was at a complete loss for words. I never thought I\u2019d be torn from my daughter before her due date.\n\n\"I never thought I\u2019d have to experience such trauma or loss.\u201d\n\n\"I never thought I\u2019d be torn from my daughter before her due date.\" Source: Desire Guardiola", "description": "\"I felt an intense pain in my stomach - I could barely walk.
