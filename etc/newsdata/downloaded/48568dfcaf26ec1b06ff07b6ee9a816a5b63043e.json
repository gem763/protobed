Curry and full back Elliot Daly are the only players to have been involved in every minute of England\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe 21-year-old Sale rookie has earned widespread acclaim for a series of command performances and must be considered a prime contender to be named World Young Player of the Year on Sunday.\n\nUnderhill has been similarly impressive and influential. When New Zealand were put to the sword in Saturday\u2019s semi-final in Yokohama, the 23-year-old Bath flanker was at the forefront of a ferocious English defensive effort. His thunderbolt hits on Kieran Read and Jordie Barrett symbolised the way the Kiwis were dismantled by the physicality of the underdogs.\n\nEngland's defence coach John Mitchell paid them the compliment in the run up to Saturday\n\nSeven days earlier, Curry and Underhill had combined forces to emphatically eclipse Pocock and his Wallaby side-kick Michael Hooper. It felt like a seismic shift in the global back-row hierarchy and a reversal of the balance of power in the area of breakdown conflict.\n\nThere was one telling passage of play when Curry won a ruck turnover and, when Owen Farrell kicked ahead, he chased and flattened Reece Hodge with a shuddering tackle. Underhill was also close by and he competed over the ball, leading to an England penalty. It was a perfect illustration of how this dynamic double-act have galvanised the national team.\n\nMitchell\u2019s remit includes acting as a back-row mentor and when he was asked about the flankers who have formed such an effective alliance since joining forces in August, he said: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of McCaw and a lot of Pocock in them, but they\u2019re quicker.\n\nBoth of them are emerging as world leaders in the scavenging flanker category\n\n\u2018A few years back, to go from seven to six would have been a difficult adjustment, but Tom Curry has really developed his set-piece skills, working with one of the best: Steve Borthwick. A few years ago, with the mindset of another openside flanker, he would have probably turned it down as being too challenging, I think.\u2019\n\nMitchell was asked how the two tyros manage to repeatedly smash back imposing ball-carriers so decisively. \u2018Jeez... well, they\u2019ve got rocks and boulders,\u2019 he said, pointing to his shoulders. \u2018They\u2019re in pretty good condition. Jon Clarke (England fitness and assistant defence coach) has done a great job with them and they\u2019re in superb condition.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about timing. It\u2019s all about controlling the attacker. They have good height as well and they can get lower than most. We do work on that. We address it as part of the way we practise, but they own it. They\u2019re developing those skills through their own awareness.\n\nOwen Farrell has been looking happy in training following his slight injury in the semi-final\n\n\u2018Every weekend, you experience different things in terms of the collisions. Some opposition are taller and some are smaller, so the carrier types who come towards you are slightly different. Every team has different strengths, so understanding how to get in there and make your tackles is important. That leads to adjustments, but they are bright lads.\u2019\n\nEngland\u2019s players are remaining steadfastly calm and composed in the face of euphoria generated by their 19-7 win over New Zealand and the swirl of hype building around them as the World Cup final approaches.\n\nThey are aware that to get ahead of themselves would be to undermine their chances of completing their Far East crusade by overcoming the Springboks.\n\nUnderhill and Curry will be looking to replicate their top performance against New Zealand\n\nCourtney Lawes spoke for the squad when he was asked if it has been easy to retain composure in the midst of such an historic scenario.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re pretty chilled,\u2019 said the Northampton lock. \u2018It took maybe a day to realise what kind of opportunity we\u2019ve given ourselves, but now we\u2019re back to training and focusing on the next game.\n\n\u2018We always planned to beat New Zealand, we always planned to get to the final, so it was no surprise to us.\n\nCourtney Lawes believes England's players are relaxed ahead of the Rugby World Cup final\n\n\u2018The good thing about this team is we are used to not getting ahead of ourselves. We know we\u2019ve got the opportunity to make history but it\u2019s not just going to happen. We know that and we know there is a way we\u2019re going to have train this week and things we have to do to put ourselves in the best position to come away with a win at the weekend and make history.\u2019\n\nEngland have once again avoided wholesale injury setbacks, with scrum-half Willi Heinz the only player to be ruled out during this World Cup. Lawes admitted that there has been some good fortune to go with good habits behind the scenes. \u2018There is no way of getting round it, there is always an element of luck in terms of injuries,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018How you recover and get right for games is important. We recover better than anyone probably, in terms of sports massage, getting the right sleep, the right supplements. That certainly helps.\u2019", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN TOKYO: Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have been acclaimed as turbo-charged English versions of the great modern-era openside icons - Richie McCaw and David Pocock", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/21/20347050-0-image-a-24_1572383200187.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
