(Raphael Talisman/For The Washington Post)\n\nA petite woman in a bright pink shirt jumped up and grasped a pull-up bar in a suburban Maryland park. She shifted her grip. Then she began to knock out pull-ups \u2014 one, two, three. Onlookers burst out in applause, cheering her on. They had gathered on a cool Saturday morning to learn how to use the new gym at the 38th Avenue Neighborhood Park in Hyattsville.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see people out and being active,\u201d said Sam Orah, a fitness trainer. He walked the crowd of about 13 through a circuit workout, showing them how to use suspension rings, plyo boxes (for jumping on and off) and pull-up bars. \u201cWe need one of these in every city.\u201d\n\nThe sleek blue-and-silver setup is the latest version of what the San Francisco-based National Fitness Campaign calls a \u201cfitness court.\u201d The free-to-use facilities are one way that communities such as Hyattsville are helping their citizens squat, push-up and lunge toward healthier living.\n\nThe NFC is a public-private partnership that was founded by developer and fitness enthusiast Mitch Menaged in 1979 to fill a need for \u201chealthy infrastructure,\u201d according to its director of partnerships, Trent Matthias. The original fitness courts were wooden structures with such features as pull-up bars and benches; the organization helped install more than 10,000 of them in about 4,000 communities in the United States, Canada and Australia over roughly three decades. After Menaged decided to modernize the setup, the NFC began to redesign the courts in 2012. The rollout across the country began last year, and Matthias expects to have more than 100 of the new courts open by the end of this year.\n\n\n\nJoan Myles of Hyattsville performs pull-ups on the new equipment. (Raphael Talisman/For The Washington Post)\n\nEach new 32- by 35-square-foot court is made of 30 pieces of weather-resistant equipment divided into seven stations. At each station, users can focus on one area \u2014 core, squatting, pushing, lunging, pulling, agility and bending \u2014 by performing such body-weight exercises as box jumps, lunges or sit-ups. (A full circuit takes about seven minutes.)\n\nAcquiring a court is a process that can take eight or nine months. Communities submit an application online, and NFC staff works with applicants to analyze locations where the court would create the most impact, such as an undeveloped field along a park trail or a tennis court that has seen better days. \u201cIt really depends on the community and what\u2019s available,\u201d Matthias said. Installing a court takes about a month.\n\n[12 etiquette tips for yoga class \u2014 and the reasons behind them]\n\nOfficials in Maryland Heights, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, thought a fitness court would be the ideal use for a tiny plot of land \u2014 less than half an acre \u2014 where nothing else could really go. \u201cThere is no other amenity like it on that side of town,\u201d said Tracey Anderson, the city\u2019s director of parks and recreation.\n\nThe city also installed a light so the facility could be used at night, and the court has become a popular workout spot since it opened about a year ago. \u201cThere\u2019s always people there,\u201d Anderson said. It\u2019s become such a hit that council members have even asked if they can install another one on the city\u2019s east side, she said.\n\nIn an era when there\u2019s an app for nearly everything, the free Fitness Court app (available on Android and iOS) teaches users to create a circuit workout on their own. \u201cThere can be a mind-set of \u2018I don\u2019t know how to use it, so I\u2019m not going to,\u2019 \u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut what\u2019s great is that you can tell people, \u2018There\u2019s an app! You have a smartphone, you can learn how.\u2019 \u201d\n\nColleges are also getting on board \u2014 Stanford and Baylor are among the campuses that have installed courts. An expansion to high schools is in the works. \u201cWe\u2019re developing programs for teens to get involved in a constructive way outdoors,\u201d Matthias said. (Fitness courts are designed for ages 14 and up, he said; national regulations determine the minimum age.)\n\nThe NFC\u2019s renewed push comes as obesity in the United States continues to rise, even as adults are exercising more, according to data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. And the NFC\u2019s efforts don\u2019t stop at the installation of a fitness court. \u201cWe want to create impact long after it\u2019s been put in the ground,\u201d Matthias said.\n\nTo do that, community involvement is essential, and municipalities are exploring different ways to create partnerships to promote well-being centered on the outdoor gyms. In Loveland, Colo., UCHealth, a local health system, conducts classes at the city\u2019s fitness court, featuring such topics as healthy eating for seniors. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about it, to breathe in the fresh air and see the mountains,\u201d said LeAnn Williams, the city\u2019s recreation manager, about the court. \u201cIt\u2019s a better experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nOrah leads Hyattsville residents in performing lunges. (Raphael Talisman/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe NFC also launched an \u201cambassador\u201d program this year that allows fitness instructors, as well as public safety officials such as firefighters, to apply to teach free classes on-site. Loveland\u2019s recreation department has built up a strong squad of ambassadors since its court opened in June, Williams said. Instructors from their recreation center have been holding introductory workouts and boot camps on-site three to four times a week. \u201cIt\u2019s a neat way to connect the community,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nA court can also translate to savings for residents, because using it is free: If Loveland residents don\u2019t want to pay for memberships (or $5.25 for a drop-in class) at the city\u2019s recreation center, they can sign up for a free class at the court, weather permitting. With classes at the recreation center booked to capacity, Williams said, the fitness court offers a welcome alternative and has been \u201cwell worth our investment.\u201d\n\nThe cost of a fitness court varies, depending on how the chosen location needs to be developed. The NFC offers grants to jurisdictions funded by corporate sponsors, and money is awarded on a rolling basis annually.\n\nHyattsville received about $10,000 toward the cost of its facility. The city paid the rest of the bill, about $100,000, according to city spokesman Jake Rollow. Maryland Heights also received a grant of about $10,000 and spent at least $80,000 more to develop the property, spokeswoman Trisha Hall said. Loveland received a grant of $30,000 and split the remaining $123,000 cost 60/40 with UCHealth, said Molly Elder, the business manager for the parks department.\n\nIn Hyattsville, there has been a lot of support for the project, said Lesley Riddle, the city\u2019s director of public works and one of several officials on hand Saturday to introduce residents to the fitness court. \u201c[Mayor Candace Hollingsworth] has a lot of passion for bringing accessibility for health and wellness and exercise,\u201d Riddle said. \u201cWe took that and ran with it.\u201d\n\nPlans to install a shade cloth over the structure are in the works, Riddle said, and the city is hoping to add WiFi there as well. The court\u2019s app comes with the potential for communities to gather user statistics and other data, but Hyattsville currently doesn\u2019t plan to do so, Rollow said. \u201cWe just want to see folks use it and enjoy it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe court opened earlier this summer and has already seen plenty of use. \u201cIf you build it, they will come,\u201d Riddle said.\n\nCarole Plato, 57, rode her bike over to check out the fitness court, which is next to the Northwest Branch trail, making it convenient for runners and cyclists. \u201cWe\u2019re really lucky to have this,\u201d she said after finishing the orientation workout. \u201cAnd it\u2019s free!\u201d", "description": "The National Fitness Campaign partners with communities to fund circuit workout systems that are free to residents.", "authors": ["Morgan Voigt", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dewwodKID8Mxa7FZfwtpZfVrpUw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZYOZIRG7YUI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg"}
