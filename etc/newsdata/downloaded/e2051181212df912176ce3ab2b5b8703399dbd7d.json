The gold sector is currently giving a short-term pullback, and this is setting up another buying opportunity in gold shares, such as DRDGold, as shown on its chart.\n\nWeekly Chart\n\nChart Setup: DRD triggered its initial buy when it broke out above line 2 a few months back: it has exceeded its first target from channel 1-2 and still has higher to go.\n\nIts Elliot Wave count (roman numerals), shows it in a Wave-iv correction right now, with another large rally (Wave-v up) to come. (Elliot Wave analysis postulates five waves in the direction of the trend).\n\nIts weekly Stochastic (on top) is relatively overbought, and can still pull back more before the price is ready to go again.\n\nStrategy Details: Look to buy it again on a pullback to/near the R5.50 level. (I like it see a reversal day/candle up in that area to enter).\n\nTarget: After the pullback, a rally to the R10 level to start taking trading profits. Note, long-term resistance is line 4 at R12.62.\n\nStop-loss: A weekly (i.e. Friday) close below R5.00.\n\nDEFINITIONS:\n\nShort-term: A few days to a few weeks e.g. 3-4 weeks\n\nMed-term: About 2-5 months.\n\nLong-term: About 10-18 months.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Colin Abrams covering: Drdgold.
