Anne-Marie Caruso, NorthJersey\n\nStory Highlights Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blames Fethullah Gulen for 2016 coup attempt\n\nThousands of Turks have fled a government crackdown targeting followers of Hizmet\n\nBERGEN COUNTY, N.J. \u2013 On the run in Turkey, Yasin Atik changed apartments four times, pulled his children out of school and avoided parks and hospitals where officers might ask for his identification. In his government's eyes, he was a supporter of terrorists.\n\nLast year in July, Atik escaped with his wife and four children on a small wooden boat across the Meric River, crossing into Greece, then trekking for six hours to safety.\n\n\u201cI thought of myself behind bars, my wife behind bars, the kids by themselves,\u201d said Atik, speaking at a Clifton, New Jersey, apartment he shares with two roommates. All fled Turkey. \u201cIt was unthinkable. So for two years, we kept moving.\u201d\n\nThe former philosophy teacher spends his days fixing cellphones and learning English in suburban northern New Jersey, waiting to reunite with the rest of his family, who remained in Greece but will soon come to the USA.\n\nAtik is one of thousands of Turks who fled a government crackdown targeting followers of Hizmet, a social movement inspired by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen. Many have come to northern New Jersey, home to a large Turkish American community that is less than 100 miles from where Gulen has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania's Poconos region since 1999.\n\nAmong them are teachers, lawyers and journalists who were labeled terrorists or enemies of the state in a purge under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who blames Gulen for a failed coup attempt in 2016. In the USA, they wait and hope for democratic reforms in Turkey and watch worriedly as President Donald Trump builds an uneasy relationship with Erdogan.\n\nFethullah Gulen: Alleged mastermind of attempted coup in Turkey is cleric living in Pennsylvania\n\n'Don't be a tough guy': Donald Trump pens letter to Turkish President Erdogan after Syria phone call\n\n\u201cWhen you criticize the government, it\u2019s unfortunately very difficult to live in Turkey,\u201d said Murat Kaval, president of Advocates of Silenced Turkey, a global human rights advocacy group based in Wayne, New Jersey. \u201cYou\u2019re labeled a terrorist.\u201d\n\nErdogan faces international condemnation after launching a military campaign against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The Trump administration threatened economic sanctions, although the president said Tuesday the fight between Turkey and America's Kurdish allies \"has nothing to do with us.\"\n\nKaval estimated about 500 Turks have come to New Jersey since the coup attempt July 15, 2016. Erdogan blamed Gulen for masterminding the coup, although the influential preacher has denied involvement. Turkey has since detained thousands with suspected ties to Hizmet, which it calls the Fethullah Terrorist Organization, as well as citizens who challenged the government's increasingly authoritarian rule.\n\nYasin Atik is one of hundreds of people who have fled Turkey since 2016 because of political persecution and sought asylum in New Jersey.

Erdogan has pushed the United States to extradite Gulen and shut down a network of charter schools around the nation founded by individuals linked to Hizmet. The administration has resisted.\n\n\u2018We did nothing wrong\u2019\n\nAtik, 39, taught high school philosophy and psychology and volunteered for an organization that raised scholarship money for Hizmet schools.\n\nHizmet \u2013 \"service\" in Turkish \u2013 has millions of followers around the world who have built businesses, media outlets and educational institutions. To supporters, Gulen is an enlightened leader who champions education, interfaith dialogue and tolerance. To critics, he is an enemy whose adherents tried to take over the Turkish state by infiltrating the military, police and judiciary.\n\nWhen Atik learned there were indictments accusing him and his wife of supporting terrorism, they decided to flee with their children. \u201cWe understand they would not give us any freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we were confident we did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\n'The Kurds are being slaughtered': House votes to condemn President Trump\u2019s troop pullout from Syria\n\nTurkey's leader: rebuffs US call for Syria cease-fire, says he'll meet Pence, not just Trump\n\nHis wife was pregnant. Terrified of going to a hospital for fear of arrest, she gave birth to their fourth child in their living room with help from a nurse. She stayed silent, worrying neighbors would call police if they heard noise.\n\n\u201cSeven hours of labor. She didn\u2019t scream or yell or anything,\u201d Atik said, tearfully remembering the day Yusuf, now 1\u00bd, was born.\n\nAtik arrived in the USA a year ago and has been granted asylum. He works part-time at the Turkish Community Center in Clifton, which helped him find a second job at a cellphone repair shop. Several times a week, he takes English lessons at Bergen Community College and at the Crossroads Church in Clifton.\n\nLife has been \"very hard,\" he said, struggling to pay rent and send money to his family in Greece. Tuesday, he said the United States approved his request for family reunification. He expects they will arrive in a month.\n\n\"I intend to live in peace in this country,\" he said. \"I want to live together with my family in this country. I want my children to learn English and get good education.\"\n\n\u2018My neighbors didn\u2019t greet me back\u2019\n\nTugba, 37, did not want her last name used for fear of retaliation against her family in Turkey. She was born in Russia and moved to Turkey in 2004 after she married her husband, Faruk. The school where she taught English was closed when Erdogan declared a state of emergency after the coup.\n\nThe worst part, she said, was the isolation she and her family faced as authorities singled out Hizmet as a terrorist movement. The landlord kicked them out, and some relatives stopped calling.\n\nTu\u011fba fled Turkey with her three children to join her husband in America. (Photo: Anne-Marie Caruso/NorthJersey.com)\n\n\u201cKids from the neighborhood stopped playing with my children,\u201d said Tugba, who lives in Garfield. \u201cMy neighbors didn\u2019t greet me back. It hurts when you feel everyone turns their back to you and your family.\u201d\n\nHer husband, a principal of a Hizmet school, had a tourist visa and fled to the USA. Tugba, as a Russian citizen, was able to leave via her home country and came to the USA in 2018 via the Mexican border.\n\nFaruk, whose asylum has been approved, works delivering goods for a bakery. Tugba's asylum was approved last week.\n\nTugba's children, ages 5 and 10, go to public school in Garfield. Her oldest, 15, a student at a charter school, is a talented artist who hopes to study animation in college.\n\nCLOSE The controversial Turkish cleric is seen by his followers as an enlightened leader and by the ruling party in Turkey as a dangerous enemy and traitor. Wochit\n\nAmerican immigration courts may grant asylum to people who prove they face persecution in their homelands based on race, religion, nationality or social or political affiliations.\n\nThe State Department's Turkey 2018 Human Rights Report says Turkish authorities dismissed or suspended more than 130,000 civil servants, arrested or imprisoned more than 80,000 citizens, and closed more than 1,500 civic groups on terrorism-related grounds after the coup attempt.\n\nAt home in New Jersey\n\nTurkish asylum seekers have been drawn to northern New Jersey because of its long-standing Turkish American community with cultural centers, organizations, stores and restaurants, and because they have family here.\n\nNearly 194,000 people of Turkish ancestry live in the USA, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, including about 17,000 in New Jersey.\n\nNew Jersey is home to Gulen followers and organizations, including Peace Islands Institute, which promotes inter-religious understanding. The Alliance for World Values, which speaks for Gulen, has an office in Clifton, and its president lives in New Jersey.\n\nAsylum seekers in New Jersey try to make others feel welcome.\n\nTugba said she brought dinner to a family who moved to her neighborhood eight months ago. The husband had been jailed, and his wife still felt afraid.\n\n\"She asked me, 'Are you able to speak freely? Are you able to tell people you're from Turkey?' I told her, yes, it's free here. I told her she shouldn't be afraid,\" she said.\n\nFollow Hannan Adely on Twitter: @AdelyReporter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/17/turkish-gulen-supporters-fleeing-crackdown-seek-asylum-new-jersey/4006257002/", "description": "About 500 Turks arrived in New Jersey amid a purge of people Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016.", "authors": ["Hannan Adely", "Published A.M.
