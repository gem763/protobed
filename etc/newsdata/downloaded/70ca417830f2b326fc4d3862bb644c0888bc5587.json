No amount of PR spin about \u201cmicro seismic events\u201d will fool the thousands of Lancashire residents who described the largest earthquake like \u201ca lorry running into their home\u201d. Similarly, the entirely predictable fact that earthquakes would be triggered is even more irritating to those of us who have suffered.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAs the organiser of an impromptu protest yesterday supported by 450 local residents, we require a complete and unilateral ban on fracking, its dangerous emissions, potential to contaminate groundwater (particularly after an earthquake can damage the well casing and allow frack fluid to migrate into the aquifer) and induced earthquakes. Politicians need to be aware that with a general election possibly on the horizon, that those MPs whose parties remain in favour of earthquakes may end up finding employment elsewhere.\n\nMark Mills\n\nLittle Plumpton\u200b\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Here we have a couple of chains; a bookies, a Tesco Metro, a Co-op and Fat Face, but predominantly small independent shops, a great market place, a lot of community businesses. But with high rents and exorbitant business rates many still struggle to make ends meet. The high street isn\u2019t dead yet, it does need to change though. Councils, the government and business need to realise that it is no longer the centre of commerce that it once was.\n\nAndrew Marsh\n\nHebden Bridge\n\nWhen it comes to trains, we could learn a lot from Italy\n\nSimon Calder highlights the idiocies of current train ticket pricing.\n\nThe UK should adopt the Italian method of pricing rail tickets by the miles travelled, with a fixed uplift for rush hour, first class etc. We should ask for tenders for rail franchises to be submitted on a \u201cprice per mile travelled\u201d basis where the tender proposing 50p per mile beats one bidding 51p per mile. Unfortunately Italy is an EU country and the UK couldn\u2019t possibly learn anything from the EU could it?\n\nJohn Harvey\n\nBristol\n\nThey are not taking this seriously\n\nWithout a doubt climate change is the biggest threat facing our planet. Yet our populist, self-interested politicians place parochial short termism ahead of wider concerns: Trump withdrawing from the Paris Accord, Bolsonaro allowing rainforests to burn in order to increase Brazilian beef sales, Johnson encouraging fracking to enable UK to have its own fossil fuels.\n\nUntil we can elect politicians who are prepared to place world, strategic issues ahead of self interest then there is little hope for future generations. And the hypocrisy of Johnson, Trump, Macron and others heaping opprobrium on Bolsonaro is breathtaking.\n\nAlistair Wood\n\nOswestry\n\nThe levels of child poverty in the UK are shameful\n\nOur country must get back to a proper sense of perspective. Today BBC News reported that up to three million British children are thought to be at risk of hunger over the holidays.\n\nThe only response from government? A statement saying they have made \u00a39m available to help. No minister involved. No reflection on how our country \u2013 one of the top ten richest in the world \u2013 could countenance such a thing. And tellingly, no response from any other opposition party.\n\nJust a statement that says that we are giving the equivalent of just \u00a33 per head to assist the 3 million children at threat. That\u2019s just 8.5 pence per day, assuming a 5 week holiday.\n\nThis is not help, it\u2019s an insult to those children and their families.\n\nDo we the British public feel this is representative of our feelings on this matter? Or will we fall into the trap of just seeing a big number from the government spokesman \u201cspaffed out\u201d, and then move on?\n\nOur people, so beloved of those who say that they represent our values are being failed by all our political classes. They should be ashamed, but in the present climate I think we all know that they won\u2019t be.\n\nJohn Sinclair\n\nPocklington\n\nWhy no tourist tax in Edinburgh?\n\nWe learn that Edinburgh Festival Fringe audience broke the three million barrier for the first time, with many overnight stays \u2013 yet still the SNP administration at Holyrood doesn\u2019t allow hard-pressed Edinburgh Council to levy a much-needed tourist tax. For Nicola Sturgeon and the rest of the SNP establishment, it seems the centralisation and control of power come first, sadly the well-being of our cities somewhat distant second.\n\nMartin Redfern\n\nEdinburgh", "description": "Yesterday, the people of Lancashire suffered an earthquake measuring 2.9 magnitude on the Richter scale, at intensity 5, with damage caused to countless homes, including my own.
