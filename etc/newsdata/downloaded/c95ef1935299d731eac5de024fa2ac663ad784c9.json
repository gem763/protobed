Otherwise, Barcelona now builds its squad through purchasing talented players from other clubs.\n\nBut with Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Ousmane Dembele all injured, coach Ernesto Valverde has been forced to turn to the club\u2019s promising youths, who suddenly have an unexpected opportunity to fill in for the team\u2019s stars.\n\nSeeing his team trailing 1-0 at Osasuna on Saturday, Valverde looked to his short bench and entrusted the young and untested Ansu Fati to spark a comeback. The teenage striker rose to the challenge, outjumping his mark to score a perfectly placed header just inside the post.\n\nThat goal made the teenager from Guinea-Bissau the youngest player to ever score in La Liga for Barcelona at the age of 16 years and 304 days. Fati belongs to Barcelona\u2019s third team, made up of 16-18-year-old players.\n\nThe cross that Fati neatly turned home came from Carles P\u00e9rez, a 21-year-old \u201cB-team\u201d forward who scored in last round\u2019s 5-2 thrashing of Real Betis. Fati made his first-team debut in that win over Betis.\n\n\u201cDespite the injuries we went out there with some young players who showed what they can do,\u201d said Pique, who committed a late hand ball that allowed Osasuna to level the final score at 2-2.\n\nCOSTA\u2019S RETURN\n\nDiego Costa, who appeared close to leaving Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this summer, played his first match since being suspended for eight Spanish league games at the end of last campaign on Sunday.\n\nHe helped start a rally from two goals down to beat Eibar 3-2 by setting up Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix.\n\nOtherwise, he still had the same trouble finding the net that has plagued him since returning to At\u00e9tico from Chelsea midway through the 2017-18 season. Since then, he has scored 12 goals in 44 matches and had his playing time reduced by injuries.\n\nHe missed a clear early chance from close range and then had two goals waived off for off-sides against Eibar.\n\nCosta\u2019s 2017-18 season was cut short by an eight-game ban he incurred for insulting a referee after being sent off in a decisive loss at Barcelona that ended Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s title chances. He missed the final seven league games of last season and then injured his left thigh last month, ruling him out for the first two rounds.\n\nBut the Brazilian-born Spain striker showed against Eibar that he remains a terror for opposing defenders with his imposing size, knack for battling high balls, and his apparent love of being a nuisance.\n\nFEKIR LEADS BETIS\n\nBetis\u2019 signing of attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir from Lyon for just under 20 million euros (22 million dollars), plus another possible 10 million euros in add-ons, could turn out to a bargain.\n\nFekir, a world champion with France, arrived to Seville to fill the gap left by Giovani lo Celso, who left for Tottenham after his superb season last year.\n\nHe has already won over Betis\u2019 supporters with two goals in three matches. He briefly gave Betis the lead at Camp Nou in round 2 before Barcelona roared back.\n\nFekir\u2019s second goal was worth three points, when he completed a 2-1 comeback over Leganes on Saturday.\n\n\u201cNabil is an incredible player, a silent leader on the pitch and a complete player,\u201d said Betis coach Rubi. \u201cWe love this player.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "With its top scorers hit by injuries, Barcelona has returned to basics.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/spain_soccer_la_liga_81980_c0-126-3019-1886_s1770x1032.jpg?c3391becb0dd7a902ad618cce66a1f041fe9df75"}
