It said that information given about the design was \"not updated during the certification program to reflect the changes to this function within the flight control system.\"\n\nIt also said that design assumptions were \"not adequately reviewed, updated, or validated.\"\n\nThe report also said that because Boeing took out mentions of MCAS from a draft of the pilot\u2019s manual, the FAA was \"not fully aware of the MCAS function and was not in a position to adequately assess training needs.\"\n\nThe New York Times previously reported on a draft report of the findings.\n\nFAA Administrator Steve Dickson told the newspaper in a statement that he would \"review every recommendation and take appropriate action.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe welcome this scrutiny and are confident that our openness to these efforts will further bolster aviation safety worldwide,\u201d he said. \"The accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia are a somber reminder that the FAA and our international regulatory partners must strive to constantly strengthen aviation safety.\n\nA Boeing spokesperson told The Hill in a statement that the company was reviewing the report's recommendations.\n\n\"Safety is a core value for everyone at Boeing and the safety of the flying public, our customers, and the crews aboard our airplanes is always our top priority,\" the spokesperson said. \"Boeing is committed to working with the FAA in reviewing the recommendations and helping to continuously improve the process and approach used to validate and certify airplanes going forward.\"", "description": "A government task force\u00a0has reportedly found that Boeing did not sufficiently inform regulators about\u00a0aspects of\u00a0a new automated system that contributed to two recent crashes of its 737 Max.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/boeing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
