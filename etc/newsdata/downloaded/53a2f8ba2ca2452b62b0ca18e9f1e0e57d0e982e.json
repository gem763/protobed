You bend over to pick something up the wrong way, or you twist in an awkward direction, and zap! Your back starts radiating pain. Until recently, the common recommendation for a hurt back was drugs and more drugs, mixed with a little rest. However, after a number of studies proved that\n\nAnother Case of Over-prescription and Mistreatment\n\ndrugs don\u2019t really help in most cases, the American College of Physicians has ripped up the old guidelines. And what they\u2019re replaced them with might surprise you. Because, not only should you avoid drugs and all the inherent risks they come with, but you shouldn\u2019t rest, either. At least, rest alone isn\u2019t your best course of action. And this is something you need to get right\u2014because back pain isn\u2019t just a nuisance. It can interfere with your every waking moment.There\u2019s no doubt, back pain can affect everything you do. And I\u2019m not talking about a serious back injury, like you\u2019d get in an accident or from a slipped disk. I\u2019m just talking about the common back pain that comes from overexertion, awkward positioning, or sometimes simply the rigors of age. The human body hasn\u2019t been standing on two legs for all that long, evolutionarily speaking. And your back bears the brunt of the issues that come from walking around on a jury-rigged bipedal system. So it\u2019s no surprise that back pain\u2014especially lower back pain\u2014is something we all have to deal with. What is a little surprising, though, is just how low it can lay you. Depending on the severity of the pain, you could be knocked out of work for a week or more. You might not be able to leave the house. Even just going to the bathroom could be a major chore. That\u2019s why, until recently, most doctors prescribed powerful drugs to anyone with a back injury, no matter how minor. Too bad we\u2019ve now discovered those drugs don\u2019t help your back at all. What\u2019s more, all that rest doesn\u2019t help either. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when you\u2019re suffering from back pain, you don\u2019t want to leap into an intense workout routine and hope for the best. But research has now shown us better drug-free back pain remedies: moving around! Not just any old movement, either. You want to attack your back pain in very specific ways.\n\nNatural Back Pain Relief #1: Yoga\n\nNatural Back Pain Relief #2: Massage\n\nWhen you\u2019re in pain, the last thing you probably want to do is go to a yoga class. But that\u2019s exactly what the College of Physicians has found works. You don\u2019t want to do just any yoga , of course. There are specific movements and poses that aim to relieve pressure in your back, stretch out the muscles there, and ease as much tension as possible. Any good yoga instructor will know those poses well, and be able to guide you. But I don\u2019t recommend doing this alone with an online video or DVD. Doing a yoga pose the wrong way could hurt, instead of help. But, work with a trained instructor, do the recommended poses the right way, and you\u2019ll feel relief as soon as you\u2019re done. It\u2019s nearly magical, how well it works.In addition to knotty muscles, one of the biggest causes of back pain is inflammation. And few things can clear up both problems faster than a professional massage . In addition to soothing problems in your muscles, massage can also work out \u201cwrinkles\u201d in your myofascial layer\u2014dense tissue wrapped around your muscles. Sometimes, problems in the fascial layer can cause pain by constricting muscles\u2014like a twisted sheet can trap and squeeze your legs. But the best part about massage is that it literally rubs out inflammation. During massage, blood flow may increase, but it also releases tension and clears the way for inflammation to go down in the immediate aftermath of a massage. Specifically, it appears that massage inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines. Why this happens isn\u2019t entirely understood\u2014but we know it works. Again, you want a trained professional to give you your massage. Someone who doesn\u2019t know the body well could end up making your problems worse. But any skilled professional has studied human anatomy, and knows exactly how to relieve back pain, without causing any damage. A good masseuse will speed the healing process, not hinder it.\n\nNatural Back Pain Relief #3: The Chiropractor\n\nNatural Back Pain Relief #4: Active Release Technique (ART)\n\nA good chiropractor is like a passive yoga session, combined with a skilled masseuse. A good chiropractor can speed your recovery from back pain like few other people. However, in this case, it\u2019s extremely important you know who you\u2019re working with. Many chiropractors like to put on a show\u2014giving your back an adjustment with a good crack, for instance. However, if you\u2019re already suffering from back pain, cracking your back is often counterproductive. It might feel good in the moment. But it can get in the way of recovery long-term. You might have noticed a pattern forming here\u2014the best things for you are often uncomfortable in the moment, but help as soon as you finish. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important you have a chiropractor you know and trust. They will likely manipulate you in ways that can be uncomfortable. You need someone you trust so that you can take discomfort, knowing that it\u2019s leading to less tense, less inflamed muscles. A chiropractor who doesn\u2019t have the necessary skill can wind up irritating your muscles, which is worse than if you\u2019d done nothing.Active Release Technique (ART) is just what it sounds like. Using specialized movements, you manipulate your muscles into stretches, release tension, and promote quick recovery from injuries. The best way to think of ART is as a western, clinical version of yoga. They work in much the same way, and towards the same sorts of goals. Indeed, some of the ART techniques bear a striking resemblance to yoga. You can practice ART on your own, using online guides. But again, getting help from an expert will always be safer and, usually, more effective. Many chiropractors actually use ART, as do physical therapists. Get a program from someone who knows, and then you can practice yourself at home. All of these methods, done properly, are completely safe\u2014unlike pain relievers or muscle relaxants, which carry a number of side effects. And also unlike drugs, that only mask pain temporarily, leaving you vulnerable to over-doing it further, these methods actually work to relieve your pain permanently, and help your body heal faster. Some injuries\u2014especially serious ones\u2014will require more attention from a doctor. But the vast majority of back pains go away on their own, as irritation calms down. These four methods just help that irritation go down faster, and get rid of your pain quicker. Now that even the College of Physicians recognizes the benefits, there\u2019s no reason you should turn anywhere else when you\u2019re in need of pain relief.\n\nReferences", "description": "We\u2019ve all experienced it.
