It proved a canny time to sell. Other than sale of 3 million shares at $4.25 each in October last year, the 13.1 million shares Mr Kogan offloaded in total were sold at levels higher than the current share price. Kogan.com floated at $1.80.\n\nAnother Rich Lister who showed exquisite timing was poker machine pioneer Len Ainsworth. The 94-year-old received a $473 million cheque in January after deciding to offload the bulk of his holding in Ainsworth Game Technology. The deal, originally agreed to with buyer Novomatic in 2016 was priced at $2.75 a share. The sale has protected Mr Ainsworth from enormous wealth destruction.\n\nAinsworth Gaming Technology has had a torrid year with the poker machine manufacturer slashing profit forecasts in May by more than 50 per cent as it warned about the impact of competition and regulatory issues.\n\nIf Mr Ainsworth did the same deal with Novomatic on Friday the size of his cheque would have shrunk to just $175 million. Mr Ainsworth still has a small parcel of shares, roughly 1.87 per cent of the company's issued stock. The paper value of that holding is under water to the tune of $6.8 million.\n\nThe youngest member to enjoy the spoils of one of the year's best performing shares is Nicholas Molnar. The 28-year-old Young Rich Lister has had his wealth supercharged since the listing last June of the retail payments business adored by Millennials: Afterpay Touch Group.\n\nIn May Molnar and co-founder Anthony Eisen, sold 2.5 million shares each to net $17.35 million. But had they waited until Friday they could have netted an extra $6 million - or $157,000 a day since the trade on May 22.\n\nStill, the remaining parcel of 22.5 million shares each is worth a cool $210 million, after an 8.9 per cent rally on Friday capped off a return of 122 per cent since its November 20 float.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe surge in value for Afterpay, which punched through the $2 billion market capitalisation barrier on Friday, will propel Mr Molnar up the rank's of this year's Financial Review Young Rich List. Based on last year's list, Mr Molnar, who was ranked 25 last year, would enter the top 10 wealthiest people under the age of 40.\n\nIn the opposite direction is Joel Macdonald, who is at risk of dropping off this year's Young Rich List after the disastrous performance of the one-time market darling GetSwift. The logistics software maker fell foul with investors after AFR Weekend revealed it had twice failed to update the market about losing materially significant contracts.\n\nMr Macdonald, whose wealth is largely comprised of his GetSwift stake, was valued at $36 million last year. On Friday his GetSwift shares were worth less than half that at $15 million.\n\nAnother to find stockmarket misfortune is shopping centre millionaire Shaun Bonett, who is also a director of underperforming comparison website iSelect. The plunging share price attracted buying, but from Predator Innovation Holdings Australia, which owns arch rival Compare the Market, and now owns a 19.6 per cent stake.\n\nSolomon Lew's public battle with Myer has delivered plenty of entertaining headlines but it has done little for the value of the billionaire rag trader's holding in the beleaguered department store group, which is one of the worst performing stocks of the year. Mr Lew's 10.8 per cent stake, bought for $101 million last year was worth just $32 million on Friday. Myer's shares sunk 62 per cent over the year.\n\nThose having a more enjoyable year included WiseTech's Richard White, who pocketed $73 million selling a small parcel of shares in December. The shares have continued to gain momentum, with Mr White's paper profit swelling by $1.25 billion over 2017-18.", "description": "It wasn't a bad year to take profit off the table, especially for some of the Rich List founders behind this year's best performing stocks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_800%2C$height_450/t_crop_fill/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f3a44f30c1dec79afd0b86b25bc242d7e4fb366b", "published_at": "2018-06-29"}
