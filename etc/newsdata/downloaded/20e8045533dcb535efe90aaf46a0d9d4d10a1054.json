In April, their research found only 27% of 355 practices it surveyed were taking on new NHS child patients.\n\n'We are trying our hardest'\n\nImage copyright Kirsty Lee Image caption Kirsty Lee's daughter has autism and her parents say brushing her teeth can be hard\n\nKirsty Lee lives on the Gurnos estate in Merthyr Tydfil. Her six-year-old daughter has autism, and getting her to brush her teeth is challenging.\n\n\"Some days she will brush her teeth for me, but only if it is in the bath; other days it is just not possible,\" said Kirsty, who said her daughter could end up headbutting and biting her.\n\nKirsty said before her daughter's front baby teeth fell out they were badly decayed, but that the rest of her teeth were fine.\n\n\"We are trying our best, she goes to the dentist quite regularly, they are pretty impressed with her teeth considering,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Harrhy said she was seeing children with \"mushy\" teeth after being fed sugar in baby bottles and given sweets and fruit covered in sugar\n\nMs Harrhy said she hoped the generation of children involved in the scheme would pass on good habits when they had children.\n\nBut she worries some are being left with a \"lifelong phobia of dentists\" after having general aesthetic to have most of their teeth removed.\n\n\"They are often really nervous about coming back to see a dentist in the future, the last time they came they had all their teeth taken out and they woke up sore and scared,\" she said.\n\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said the Designed to Smile scheme had made a difference and refocusing it would help new parents form good habits with their children from a young age.\n\nBut he recognised more needed to be done to support families to make more informed choices when it came to what their children eat.\n\n\"I do not believe parents set out, when they have children to leave that sort of environment where a child has to have all of their teeth removed,\" he said.\n\n\"It is about helping and supporting parents to make the best choices with and for their children.\"", "description": "While the number of children with tooth decay is falling, dentists say parents need more help.", "authors": ["Rachel Flint", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/66C2/production/_108860362_img_6903-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
