Greene, who came third at this year\u2019s CrossFit Games, admits at that point in her life she was a far cry from her current state.\n\n\u201cI was playing rugby, but I was going out and partying a lot, scraping through and being pretty useless. I also worked long hours at a bar in town.\u201d\n\nGreene\u2019s mother decided she needed a kick in the behind.\n\n\u201cMy mom bought me a six week pass [to a CrossFit gym] as I was getting a bit lazy and maybe going out a bit much.\u201d\n\nThe former gymnast, who stands 163cm and weighs in at 61 kilograms, according to CrossFit\u2019s website, got hammered in the first workout at the \u201cbox\u201d, which CrossFit gyms are known as.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy first class was overhead squats, which I was useless at.\u201d\n\nThe overhead squat is seen as one of the tougher moves in CrossFit, for its combination of raw power and technical abilities. Weightlifters regularly do the move in training for the snatch, and clean and jerk.\n\n\u201cI think I enjoyed the challenge, so I stuck at it after that,\u201d said Greene, \u201cit definitely put me on the straight and narrow.\u201d\n\nZoom ahead a year and Greene found herself miles from New Zealand, as she moved to Abu Dhabi in 2014 to be a coach at Vogue Fitness, which now runs the CrossFit box Yas. Greene wasted no time in leaving and making an impression on the CrossFit community in the United Arab Emirates. Within three weeks, she took home gold at the Dubai Fitness Championship, which is now known as the Dubai CrossFit Championship, the first \u201csanctionals\u201d the sport had created as a pathway to the Games.\n\nThis year\u2019s DCC will take place on December 11-14 and features a healthy contingent of the sport\u2019s top athletes vying for an invite via the tournament\u2019s online workout, including Icelandic stars Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson, who came third at the games, and Sara Sigmundsdottir, who has finished in the top four three times.\n\nThe UAE is known for its robust expat community, which is estimated at 87 per cent of the 9.6 million people living in the country. The UAE is also a bit of a CrossFit hotbed in the Middle East as the company lists the tiny nation as having 23 affiliates spread over Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Greene said it\u2019s been a great place to fine-tune herself as an athlete and a coach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awesome place to live. The Emirates are so welcoming, the expats are fun to be around and everyone can learn something from someone else. I love it here and have met some of my best friends and fianc\u00e9e here, so I have no complaints.\n\nGreene also said it\u2019s been great to help teach a population base about exercise and proper eating. According to a study published in the US National Library of Medicine, obesity rates for expats in the UAE are \u201cextremely high\u201d.\n\n\u201cHealth and fitness is fairly new over here,\u201d said Greene, \u201ca lot of people grow up not exercising ever in their childhood, which is new for me. So to get them into the gym, moving well and enjoying themselves is pretty cool.\u201d\n\nThe move has also been a boom for her CrossFit career as, in Greene\u2019s first appearance at the Games in 2016, she came third, then came eight in 2017, 11th in 2018. Another bronze came last year, behind Kristen Holte and Australian Tia-Clair Toomey.\n\nThis year also featured a number of rule changes for the athletes in terms of qualifications, the most notable being the establishing of country champions. Greene actually represented New Zealand as the top Open qualifier from her homeland. The Open is a five-week online workout competition where people submit videos to CrossFit, which is ongoing for the 2020 season.\n\nGreene said the whole thing was a bit unnerving, but she took solace in the fact that every athlete was in the same boat as her.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect with the change of structure so I think that was a good thing. I was nervous but hard to be nervous for what you don\u2019t know. I loved how the cuts were and how we found out everything just before we competed [at the Games]. I think that\u2019s the true unknown, it was quite relaxed among athletes behind the scenes, which is a surprise, but I think because everyone was in the same boat. Everyone was a lot more chilled.\u201d\n\nHealth and fitness is fairly new over here. A lot of people grow up not exercising ever in their childhood ... to get them into the gym, moving well and enjoying themselves is pretty cool.\n\nKiwi Jamie Greene on helping to bring better diet and fitness habits to the Middle East\n\nGreene is hoping to compete in Dubai again in December. She came second last year behind England\u2019s Samantha Briggs.\n\nWhen it comes to diet, Greene said small changes like trying to do meal prep for a week, adding in more veggies, cutting out sugar for a week and drinking more water can have a cumulative effect.\n\nShe also admitted to being a \u201ccandy addict\u201d, and said it was it\u2019s important to find out what works for you individually.\n\n\u201cAlso ask those around you,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has different experiences with food and diets, learn from others and see what gives you the most energy and makes you feel good, day in and day out.\u201d", "description": "The Abu Dhabi expat talks about getting whipped into shape with some overheat squats and her candy obsession", "authors": ["Patrick Blennerhassett", "Kiwi Jamie Greene On Helping To Bring Better Diet", "Fitness Habits To The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/24/fe18a464-f617-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_160437.jpg?itok=IfU7BcMO&v=1571904288", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
