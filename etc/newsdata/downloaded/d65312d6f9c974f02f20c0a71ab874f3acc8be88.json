Three people were later released. The group says others were attacked, but didn't provide details.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces are led by Gen. Mohammed Hamadan Dagalo, a member of the Sudan's Sovereign Council, who also leads the government delegation to the Juba talks.\n\nThe RSF grew out of the notorious Janjaweed militias mobilized by al-Bashir during the Darfur conflict in the early 2000s. The militias were widely accused of crimes against humanity, and al-Bashir \u2014 now jailed in Khartoum \u2014 was indicted on charges of genocide.\n\nFollowing this week's attack, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, head of the Sovereign Council, declared a nationwide cease-fire on Wednesday, according to the official SUNA news agency.\n\nThe Sudan Liberation Movement-North, led by Abdel-Aziz al-Hilu, said it won't resume talks unless the government releases the detainees, withdraws from the area where they were seized, and declares a documented cease-fire.\n\nAl-Hilu's movement is Sudan's largest single rebel group and is active in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan provinces, where it controls significant chunks of territory.\n\nAmmar Amoun, head of the movement's delegation to the talks, also called for an investigation into the killing of a tribal leader in a village under the movement's control. He said RSF attacks do \"not help create a negotiating atmosphere.\"\n\nMohammed Hassan al-Taishi, a member of the Sovereign Council, told a news conference in Juba that the cease-fire declaration was proof that peace with rebels is a \"strategic option\" for the government. He said an investigation would be opened into the attacks, and that those responsible will be brought to justice.\n\nSouth Sudan mediator Tut Galuak said the Sudanese government has started direct talks with The Sudan Revolutionary Front, an alliance of rebel groups, which has joined the protest movement against al-Bashir but did not fully support the power-sharing deal with the military.\n\nAchieving peace is crucial to the transitional government in Sudan. It has counted on ending the wars with rebel groups to revive the country's battered economy through slashing the military spending, which takes up much of the national budget.", "description": "A Sudanese rebel group said Wednesday it suspended peace talks with the transitional government, accusing the military of attacking and detaining people in a southern area under its control, an early blow to negotiations that had just begun with high expectations in South Sudan's capital, Juba.", "authors": ["Samy Magdy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
