find anything new", "language": "en", "text": "The government has had the commission\u2019s report, Competition in the Australian Financial System, since August last year but so far has implemented only a few of the 34 recommendations, such as the consumer data right to make it easier for customers to switch banks under the new open banking regime.\n\nDr King said there had already been a \u201clot of inquiries and there\u2019s been lots of recommendations\u201d from the commission, the ACCC\u2019s December 2018 report on mortgages and the banking royal commission.\n\n\u201cI would be very surprised if the new ACCC inquiry finds any significant new information,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter his calls for the banks to pass on Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts in full were ignored for a third time this year, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the ACCC on Monday to look into the pricing of residential mortgage products and to examine obstacles that stop customers switching lenders.\n\nMake ACCC competition champ\n\nDr King said adopting the commission's recommendation to make the ACCC a permanent member of the Council of Financial Regulators would help promote competition against other regulators more concerned about the financial system not blowing up.\n\nHe cited the example of the prudential regulator restricting the amount of interest-only loans to slow down the hot property market a few years ago, which the ACCC found let the big banks lift their profits by an extra $1.1 billion.\n\n\u201cThe problem is on one regulatory side you want competition and the other regulatory side wants safety and they don\u2019t really go together,\u201d Dr King said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a competition champion at the financial regulators table and that\u2019s why we recommended we need the ACCC on the Council of Financial Regulators.\u201d\n\nThe council is chaired by the Reserve Bank of Australia and its members include Treasury, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\n\nACCC boss Rod Sims has been invited to the occasional council quarterly meeting, but other regulators have privately rejected a push for the competition watchdog to be made a permanent member.\n\nOnline calculator due next year\n\nAn online calculator recommended by the Productivity Commission would allow consumers to more easily compare home loan rates across about 4000 mortgage products and get comparisons to borrowers in different postcodes.\n\n\u201cGiven the regulators have the data on actual home loans written and interest rates, making that available so customers can compare across suburbs would help,\u201d Dr King said.\n\nASIC deputy chairman Karen Chester said on Tuesday not all borrowers were paying the standard variable rate and \u201cit\u2019s very difficult for consumers to identify what rate they\u2019re really paying compared to what\u2019s being offered to somebody who is a new customer\u201d.\n\nIt is understood financial regulators are progressing the online tool, and APRA, ASIC and Treasury are in discussions to try to have it up and running by next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr King said the big banks controlled about 75 per cent to 80 per cent of mortgages.\n\nHe rejected arguments from bankers that competition was robust among the big four and from emerging fintech lenders, saying the highly regulated banks did not face major threats like other industries.\n\n\u201cMacquarie and smaller retail banks are still relatively small and struggled to make inroads into the major banks,\u201d Dr King said.\n\nHe lamented that the 2008 global financial crisis enabled big banks to take over regional banks, such as Commonwealth Bank\u2019s acquisition of Bankwest and Westpac\u2019s earlier takeover of St George, Bank of Melbourne and BankSA.\n\nDr King said mortgage brokers used to be a larger source of competition before the financial crisis, which caused a cheap source of funding, known as securitisation, to dry up.\n\n\u201cThe securitisation market has not recovered to the same level and some of APRA\u2019s rules have made it difficult for banks to establish \u2018warehouses\u2019 to put their money behind the securitisers.\u201d\n\nBrokers now work for the banks\n\nHe cited Commonwealth Bank buying mortgage broker Aussie Home Loans and Westpac acquiring RAMS Home Loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe broker channel, which is critically important to consumers and accounts for more than 50 per cent of mortgages, is not operating to promote competition in the way it once was,\u201d Dr King said.\n\n\u201cInstead of being independent brokers acting on the consumer's behalf, some of them now are unfortunately channels for the big banks and their products.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be made clearer who is behind the loans.\u201d\n\nRather than breaking up the big banks, Dr King said the government should implement the commission\u2019s recommendation to eradicate conflicts of interest in mortgage broking and banking.\n\n\u201cThe broker is still being paid to keep the customer in the old product even if it\u2019s not in the customer\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nBefore the May election, Mr Frydenberg caved in to lobbying from brokers to backflip on the royal commission\u2019s recommendation to ban upfront and trailing commissions paid by banks to brokers who sign up new home loan customers.\n\nDr King said he agreed with the government\u2019s decision to reject commissioner Kenneth Hayne\u2019s recommendation to ban upfront commissions, a potential change that would have forced customers to pay thousands of dollars out of their own pockets to receive advice from a broker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr King said the best-interest duty that applies to financial planners should not only be expanded to brokers \u2013 as the government is preparing to do \u2013 but apply to bankers writing home loans.\n\n\u201cBanks need to be obliged to act in their consumers\u2019 best interests when they\u2019re writing mortgages,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Frydenberg said the government was taking action on the Productivity Commission report in concert with its response to the royal commission.\n\n\u201cThe government continues to implement and examine ways to increase competition across the banking and financial industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also rolling out the consumer data right to give consumers greater access to their personal information allowing them to securely transfer their banking data to other providers to get a better deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiving consumers more power is what makes markets more competitive; giving them more information, giving them access to their own data, and giving them the chance to go out and get the lowest possible price on their borrowings.\u201d\n\nFormer Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris last week urged the government to boost home loan competition by creating a tough \u201cbest interest duty\u201d for brokers and bankers so loyal customers don\u2019t get ripped off.", "description": "The problems in the
