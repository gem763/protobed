Ilhan Omar, reacting to outrage over a resurfaced video in which she appeared to compare migrant detention centers to the slave trade, said Sunday she\u2019s \u201ccontroversial\u201d only because \u201cpeople seem to want the controversy.\u201d\n\nThe Minnesota Democrat\u2019s comments came during an appearance on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d with Margaret Brennan. Asked whether Omar was indeed making that comparison in the video, Omar said, \u201cI\u2019m only controversial because people seem to want the controversy.\u201d\n\nThe video, shared by a Republican National Committee Twitter account Saturday, featured Omar speaking to a group about her recent trip to Ghana. She discussed visiting a 400-year-old dungeon where Africans were held captive and separated by gender.\n\nShe said a description of the dungeon by a tour guide gave her flashbacks to images she\u2019d seen of Libya \u2013 where a slave trade has been ongoing \u2013 and images she\u2019d seen of migrant detention camps in the U.S.\n\n\u201cAnd so, of a story that happened 400 years ago, I constantly had this reminder, this horrifying image of many of the things that were taking place there in that dungeon, now taking place, whether it is taking place in the shores of North Africa or in the shores of the United States.\u201d\n\nOMAR\u2019S DESCRIPTION OF 9/11 \u2018TORE MY HEART APART,\u2019 SURVIVING SON OF TERROR VICTIM TELLS HANNITY\n\nStill, Omar insisted later that she meant for the two comparisons to be treated separately.\n\n\u201cThere is always an implied intent with every conversation I have,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you listen to the video, one comparison of what the dungeons looked like and people being sold was to what\u2019s happening in North Africa, and the other one was of family separations.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOmar continued, \u201cAnd, of course, we obviously have a crisis here with our family separation policies.\u201d\n\nAsked whether her comments were a direct attack on U.S. border agents, she said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d", "description": "Rep.
