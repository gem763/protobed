The company has previously said that it\u2019s a small update which focuses on performance improvements and quality enhancements.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t any new features, however. The November update\u2019s major additions include the fact that the File Explorer\u2019s search bar can now search within your OneDrive account online, and voice assistants other than Cortana being able to run on the Windows 10 lock screen. The update also adds the ability for new calendar entries to be created directly from the task bar, and Microsoft is introducing new notification management options. A complete list of features can be found on Microsoft\u2019s site.\n\nThe update should be much quicker to install\n\nThankfully, the update should be fairly painless to install, because Microsoft says it\u2019s using similar technology to what it normally uses to deliver its monthly service updates. A small, non-disruptive update is likely to be music to the ears of anyone who was burned by Windows 10\u2019s October 2018 update, which Microsoft was forced to pull after reports emerged that it was deleting files from its users\u2019 PCs. It wasn\u2019t until December that the \u201cOctober\u201d update was finally released for everyone, after which Microsoft pledged to focus on quality improvements for its future Windows 10 updates.\n\nIf you want to install the new update, then you\u2019ll need to first sign up to be a Windows Insider. Microsoft has provided step-by-step instructions on how to do this in the blog post announcing the name of the new update. Meanwhile, the company is also taking steps towards its next update. It says that testers on its slightly less stable \u201cSlow Ring\u201d insider program will soon be moved on to Windows 10\u2019s 20H1 update, currently due for release in the first half of 2020.", "description": "Microsoft has announced the operating system\u2019s latest update, the November 2019 Update.
