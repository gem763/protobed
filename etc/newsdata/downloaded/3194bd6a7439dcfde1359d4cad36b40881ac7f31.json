They also killed their identity.", "language": "en", "text": "This National League Championship Series started with the Cardinals tipping their caps to the dominant pitching of the Washington Nationals as they struggled to tally hits, much less runs. It ended after four games Tuesday night: Washington\u2019s 7-4 win in Game 4 completed the sweep and fractured the Cardinals\u2019 identity in the process.\n\nThese Cardinals won their division with a commitment to fundamental, clean baseball \u2014 pitching well and committing the fewest errors of any team \u2014 but as they struggled at the plate, stymied by the Nationals\u2019 starting pitching, those frustrations eroded the aspects of their game that had been considered team strengths. As much as St. Louis regretted some of its own play, it was also left impressed by a Washington team that looks like a buzz saw as it heads to the World Series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI feel like even that is not giving them enough credit,\u201d Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt said. \u201cThey\u2019re a good team. Of course we could\u2019ve played better, but we didn\u2019t. They beat us. We had four games to try to win, and they played better than we did.\u201d\n\nThe cracks started to show in the Cardinals\u2019 8-1 loss in Game 3 on Monday, but it was in Tuesday\u2019s Game 4 when the wheels completely came off for the Cardinals and their brand \u2014 just 18 pitches into the game.\n\nTrea Turner hit a leadoff single to right field on starter Dakota Hudson\u2019s third pitch, and then Adam Eaton recorded a double on the next one. But two batters later, when the Nationals already had a 2-0 lead and after the Cardinals had intentionally walked Howie Kendrick to put runners at first and second base, the mistakes became egregious. Ryan Zimmerman\u2019s line drive was quickly fielded by Edman, but Wong dropped his throw to second base. Kendrick was safe, and Washington had the bases loaded.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s when the Cardinals\u2019 most demoralizing play of this series occurred. Victor Robles hit a flyball to shallow right with two St. Louis infielders dropping back to assist right fielder Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez. Mart\u00ednez seemingly called for the catch, but Wong didn\u2019t retreat. Both then watched as the ball hit the grass, an embarrassing blunder that let the Nationals bring home another run.\n\n\u201cIt just dropped,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said.\n\nHudson didn\u2019t make it through the inning and was charged with seven runs \u2014 three were unearned \u2014 on five hits. Washington had a 7-0 lead, and considering St. Louis managed just two runs through the first three games of the series, the game felt over.\n\nAD\n\nThe Cardinals didn\u2019t go quietly \u2014 Yadier Molina homered in the fourth, they scored three runs in the fifth and rallied again in the eighth to give the Nationals a scare \u2014 but the early deficit proved too much to overcome.\n\nAD\n\nThese Cardinals, known for upholding baseball\u2019s old-school unwritten rules and tradition, have credited the Nationals\u2019 pitching after every game in this series, and they looked especially lost at the plate in the first three. After they managed just one run Monday, Mart\u00ednez said the difference between this matchup and St. Louis\u2019s NL Division Series against Atlanta was Washington having \u201cdefinitely better pitching than the Braves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you guys want to step into the box against one of those guys, you\u2019re more than welcome,\u201d Wong said.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Nationals spilled onto the field in glee after the final out, the one that formally put them in the World Series, the Cardinals stood by the railing of their dugout and watched fans erupt as red fireworks went off beyond the outfield. The team that won the NL Central still had plenty to be proud of this season, and in the midst of the disappointment over its end was admiration for its opponent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been battling all year, man,\u201d Wong said. \u201cEverybody was always counting us out, and we\u2019ve been battling all year. I guess now the haters can agree with us that we weren\u2019t the best team right now. Those guys did what they needed to do, and hats off to them.\u201d\n\nMore baseball coverage from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The cracks started to show in Game 3, but it was in Game 4 when the wheels completely came off the Cardinals and their brand \u2014 just 18 pitches into the game.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/POeCorbr6k5rm0q7aek3GqbOG2c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ITY5LPHPVQI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
