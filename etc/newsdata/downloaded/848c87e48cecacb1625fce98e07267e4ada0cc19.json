Pozner\u2019s 6-year-old son, Noah, was one of 26 victims killed in the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nFetzer has accused Pozner of circulating fabricated copies of his son\u2019s death certificate and also claimed that Noah was not Pozner\u2019s son.\n\nAdrees Latif / Reuters A mourner grieves at the entrance to Sandy Hook village in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 15, 2012.\n\nPozner, who has been a target of conspiracy theorists and stalkers since his son\u2019s death, thanked the jury for \u201crecognizing the pain and terror that Mr. Fetzer has purposefully inflicted on me and on other victims of these horrific mass casualty events, like the Sandy Hook shooting,\u201d the Wisconsin State Journal reported.\n\nHe went on to say that Fetzer and others like him have a right to believe what they\u2019d like as part of their First Amendment right. But, Pozner said, that doesn\u2019t mean they should be free to harass and terrorize others.\n\nFetzer reportedly called the damages \u201cabsurd\u201d and said he would appeal. The attorneys listed as his representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\nJonathan Ernst / Reuters People participating in the March on Washington for Gun Control in 2013 hold signs memorializing those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.\n\nPozner has filed similar suits against other conspiracy theorists, including against Alex Jones, who runs the website Infowars. In August, a Texas judge turned down Jones\u2019 attempt to toss a defamation suit brought against him by Pozner and Noah\u2019s mother, Veronique De La Rosa, who are seeking more than $1 million in damages from Jones, who has reiterated his belief that the shooting was a hoax and the parents are \u201ccrisis actors.\u201d This led to victims\u2019 families receiving death threats and online harassment from Infowars followers.\n\nFetzer has maintained that the shooting was a staged federal emergency drill to promote gun control.\n\nAndrew Burton / Reuters A Star of David for Noah Pozner is seen amongst 25 crosses at a memorial for those killed in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n\nFetzer\u2019s co-author Mike Palecek and their publisher were also named in Pozner\u2019s lawsuit. Both later reached out-of-court settlements, details of which were not disclosed, according to the State Journal.\n\nThe publisher stopped selling the book and Dave Gahary, the publisher\u2019s principal officer, issued an apology to Pozner.\n\n\u201cMy face-to-face interactions with Mr. Pozner have led me to believe that Mr. Pozner is telling the truth about the death of his son,\u201d Gahary said. \u201cI extend my most heartfelt and sincere apology to the Pozner family.\u201d\n\nBut Gahary later told Splinter News that he has no \u201cdiscomfort\u201d selling such books and that it\u2019s up to readers to decide what they want to read. He said he also continues to have questions about the Sandy Hook attack.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE Sandy Hook Denier Sentenced For Threatening Slain Child's Dad", "description": "James Fetzer was ordered to pay Leonard Pozner $450,000 for publishing false claims about the 2012 shooting.", "authors": ["Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da76be5210000311034a276.jpeg?cache=ovuyjyprzy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
