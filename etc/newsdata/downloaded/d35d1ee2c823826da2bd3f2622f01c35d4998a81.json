One of the changes that garnered less attention during last year\u2019s reform debate, yet likely had significant implications for millions this year, was the reform package\u2019s treatment of the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. Under the Internal Revenue Code, the AMT is a separate tax calculation that certain high-income earners are required to make when computing their final tax bill. It includes a unique tax-rate structure and eliminates many deductions and credits permitted by the traditional tax calculation, often creating a larger bill for those who qualify for it.\n\nIn recent years, more folks found themselves subject to the AMT; prior to 2018, the Tax Policy Center estimated that more than 5 million taxpayers fell into this group. However, 2018\u2019s tax reforms included, among other things, higher amounts for earned income that would be exempt in the AMT calculation and with that, the number of individual filers subject to the AMT was estimated to drop. Moving forward, it was estimated that 200,000 individual taxpayers would be subject to the AMT, and corporations are no longer exposed to AMT liabilities.", "description": "Tax law changes could create new opportunities for muni investors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt449bfc4a860d66a6/5cf68f9f592114fc054aa4d1/Rating_Fund_1x1.svg"}
