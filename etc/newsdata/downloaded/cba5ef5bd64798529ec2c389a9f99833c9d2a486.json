The working-level talks will be the first in about eight months and come as North Korea has been pushing the Trump administration to ease sanctions choking its paltry economy, while increasing its bargaining leverage through military provocations.\n\n\u201cThey want to talk, and we\u2019ll be talking to them soon,\u201d Trump said Thursday, brushing off North Korea\u2019s launch the day before of a submarine-based ballistic missile with a maximum range that\u2019s estimated at about 1,900 kilometers and would qualify as medium range. The test advanced leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s capabilities for a two-pronged nuclear deterrent designed for quick strikes on the U.S. and its allies from mobile launchers on land and hard-to-track submarines.\n\nThe working-level talks aren\u2019t expected to provide breakthroughs in the sputtering nuclear discussions, but will revive a process that has provided few results despite three meetings between Kim Jong Un and Trump since their landmark June 2018 summit in Singapore.\n\n\u201cDenuclearization will inevitably be a very long, complicated process because of the time it takes to negotiate agreements, the size and complexity of North Korea\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, and North Korean negotiating style,\u201d said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThe North Korean leader has given Trump until the end of the year to change course or risk a new path. He has reminded the region of the security risks posed by his mercurial state through a series of launches of at least 20 missiles since May, all of which had been short-range until Wednesday\u2019s test.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s major foreign policy initiatives has been direct dealings with Kim Jong Un. He\u2019s downplayed recent launches and insisted that Kim has lived up by his pledge to halt tests of nuclear devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles -- the last of which was fired off in November 2017.\n\nNuclear Envoy\n\n\u201cThere was a new sign from the U.S. side so I\u2019m going with high expectations and optimism,\u201d Kim Myong Gil told reporters Thursday at Beijing\u2019s international airport, saying in a video broadcast by Japanese TV network TBS that he was on his way to the talks. He didn\u2019t elaborate further.\n\nThe State Department said Tuesday that working-level talks would be held this week, but didn\u2019t announce a location.\n\nNorth Korea Tests Trump\u2019s Limits With Submarine Missile Launch\n\nSince Trump and Kim first met, weapons experts have said North Korea has been adding fissile material to its nuclear arsenal and improving its ability to launch a nuclear strike against the U.S. and two of its key Asian allies, Japan and South Korea.\n\nKim and Trump agreed at a June 30 meeting in the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula to hold working-level talks in a matter of weeks.\n\n--With assistance from Min Jeong Lee.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jon Herskovitz in Tokyo at jherskovitz@bloomberg.net;Shinhye Kang in Seoul at skang24@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Karen Leigh\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. and North Korea are set to meet for the first time in months for working-level nuclear discussions, with President Donald Trump saying Pyongyang\u2019s most provocative missile test in two years wouldn\u2019t derail them.North Korea\u2019s chief nuclear envoy Kim Myong Gil has arrived in Stockholm", "authors": ["Jon Herskovitz", "Shinhye Kang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
