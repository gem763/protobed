He stepped down as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee and saw business deals collapse. His alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, revoked his honorary degree and stripped his name from a campus plaza and scholarship.\n\nNevada gaming regulators hit Wynn Resorts with a record $20 million fine in February for failing to investigate the allegations. In the settlement, the company acknowledged that executives had been aware of the accusations against Wynn, including multiple instances which ended in multimillion-dollar payouts for the company. One involved a manicurist who said Wynn had raped her and gotten her pregnant. She was paid a $7.5 million settlement in 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAD\n\nIn its own seven-month investigation into Wynn\u2019s conduct, the Nevada Gaming Control Board uncovered multiple instances of female employees who were subjected to unwanted sexual contact by Wynn, the board said in the complaint.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe evidence from the investigation demonstrates a pattern of Mr. Wynn recklessly engaging in sexual conduct with subordinate employees, which even if it was consensual as maintained by Mr. Wynn, is oblivious to the significant power imbalance between the CEO of a major gaming company and subordinate employees dependent on Mr. Wynn\u2019s approval for continued employment,\u201d the complaint reads.\n\nThe son of a debt-laden bingo parlor operator, Wynn took over his father\u2019s business shortly after graduating college and began investing in casinos. Throughout the 1980s and \u201990s, Wynn helped architect a new era of Las Vegas glitz through luxury casinos such as the Bellagio, reestablishing the city as a destination for the ultrawealthy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSteve Wynn is an industry giant,\u201d Boone Wayson, nonexecutive director of the board, said in the statement announcing Wynn\u2019s resignation. \u201cHe is a philanthropist and a beloved leader and visionary. He played the pivotal role in transforming Las Vegas into the entertainment destination it is today.\u201d\n\nWynn co-founded Wynn Resorts \u2014 a key player in Nevada\u2019s $67.6 billion gaming industry \u2014 in 2002 with his former wife. The company operates six properties in the United States and China and brought in more than $6.7 billion in revenue last year. Its shares were up more than 2.2 percent Tuesday, to nearly $115 a share.\n\nAD", "description": "The billionaire casino magnate has been accused of pressuring employees for sex and silencing them with multi-million settlements.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qzxf1msxDkK8YQ9ZwGsWGBAyLyM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2EENEASXB4I6TKUDKBHQQ27V2Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
