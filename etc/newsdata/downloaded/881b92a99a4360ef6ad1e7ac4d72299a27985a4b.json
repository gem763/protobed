The government is willing to work with the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to get an election a different way. They will propose a bill which the smaller opposition parties have indicated they will back \u2013 as long as the Tories guarantee that Brexit doesn\u2019t happen before then. This would require a simple majority, which appears to be achievable for the government.\n\nQuick guide How can Boris Johnson get a general election before January? Show Hide A motion for a general election Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson tried again on 28 October, and failed again. A one-line bill This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson\u2019s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. A no-confidence motion The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed. Kate Proctor Political correspondent\n\nThe sticking point is the date of the election. Johnson is insisting on a 12 December poll, while the Lib Dems want one three days earlier. Corbyn appeared to suggest in parliament that his party could also back the Lib Dem plan under certain unspecified conditions.\n\nWhy is Labour refusing to vote for an election?\n\nSources close to Corbyn say they do want an election but that they have argued against another national vote because they do not trust Johnson to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn indicated that he would now consider the possibility of supporting an election after Johnson officially accepted the EU\u2019s offer of an extension to the Brexit process to 31 January.\n\nMany Labour MPs and activists fear their party could struggle in an election before Brexit happens because the party\u2019s position remains unclear. However, Corbyn loyalists argue that once the public sees the Labour leader on the campaign stump, the party will win over voters and defy the polls as they did during the 2017 election. Johnson might also suffer under pressure from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party for failing to deliver on his \u201cdo or die\u201d promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October, they claim.\n\nWhat does all this mean for Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill?\n\nConservative MPs and ministers are concerned that they could come under pressure if an election is held before delivering Brexit, but Downing Street is determined to press ahead with one, buoyed by internal polling. The prime minister\u2019s aides believe that only with a decent majority \u2013 rather than his current minority of 45 \u2013 will he be able to deliver his Brexit proposals.", "description": "Boris Johnson lost a third parliamentary vote but will table a new election bill backed by the Lib Dems", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/514be911384a9c6a87e01dc5af9378ef8da1a77e/0_30_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e1f77c292c7edf2e0a2a5909c330a2e", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
