This is highly relevant to Zuckerberg\u2019s digital currency project because Facebook has said in the past that Calibra, its subsidiary wallet app for Libra, would not share data with the tech giant.", "description": "Facebook's billionaire\u00a0co-founder\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg stood before\u00a0US Congress yesterday, in an attempt to change the rhetoric around his company's controversial \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 Libra.", "authors": ["Yessi Bello Perez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FUntitled-design-98.jpg&signature=f43dbf346dbd5b2fec8ae23e59d39df2", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
