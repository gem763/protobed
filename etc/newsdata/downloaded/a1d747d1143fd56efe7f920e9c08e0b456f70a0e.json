He expects this process could heat up next month, around Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a planned expectation that it would be sometime around Thanksgiving, so you\u2019d have basically Thanksgiving to Christmas \u2014 which would be wonderful because there\u2019s no deadline in the world like the next break to motivate senators,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) said, according to the Washington Post.\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) led the meeting alongside McConnell and, according to the Post, urged colleagues to consider penning a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), declaring that Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 which is serving as a basis for the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry \u2014 contains nothing worthy of impeachment. Graham failed to get everyone on board, with some lawmakers expressing concern over Trump\u2019s potential reaction to the members who would opt out of signing the letter.\n\n\u201cSome senators, however, pushed back against that idea, arguing that Trump would assume that those who did not sign the document would be persuadable on a vote to oust him,\u201d the Post explained.\n\nThe meeting followed Tuesday\u2019s Democrat debate, in which every single candidate on stage signaled support for pursuing an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPelosi announced this week that the lower chamber will not yet hold a full House vote on the inquiry despite the White House vowing to refrain from participating in the \u201cillegitimate\u201d inquiry until proper steps are taken.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote:\n\nYour unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no requirement that we have a vote, and at this time, we will not have a vote,\u201d Pelosi told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to call bluffs. We\u2019re here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is not a game for us; this is deadly serious.\u201d\n\nIt is not yet fully known what impact late House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings\u2019 (D-MD) untimely death will have on the Democrat Party\u2019s continued impeachment effort. He was leading the inquiry charge alongside House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY).\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the passing of Elijah Cummings, a man of great consequence and significance on the Oversight Committee for the last twenty years,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs Ranking Member and then as Chairman, he injected an unyielding passion and purpose into his work on the Committee,\u201d he continued, offering prayers to Cummings\u2019 wife, children, and loved ones.\n\nRep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) will replace Cummings as the \u201cacting\u201d House Oversight chair.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Wednesday urged GOP senators to prepare for an impeachment trial of President Trump.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mitch-McConnell-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
