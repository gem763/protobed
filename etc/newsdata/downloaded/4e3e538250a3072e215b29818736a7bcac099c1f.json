I would say I got my career,\u201d the hip-hop star testified Tuesday in a Manhattan federal courtroom where two of his ex-associates are on trial.\n\n\u201cI knew I had a winning formula for my music videos: repeat the gang image. That\u2019s what people liked.\u201d\n\nDressed in navy blue prison jumpsuit, his trademark rainbow hair mostly grown out, Tekashi was the third witness to take the stand against Aljermiah \u201cNuke\u201d Mack, 33, and Anthony \u201cHarv\u201d Ellison, 31. Mack is charged with racketeering and trafficking in narcotics such as fentanyl, while Ellison is charged with racketeering and gun crimes in connection with an alleged kidnapping of Tekashi last July.\n\nThe hyper-aggressive persona on display in Tekashi\u2019s videos was gone on the witness stand. Instead, the 23-year-old recording artist looked nervous as he described the symbiotic relationship he established with the Nine Trey Bloods: They provided protection as his fame grew, and he provided a revenue stream for their illicit activities.\n\n\u201cMy role was, just keep making hits and be the financial support for the gang,\u201d he said as he touched his brunette Dutch pigtails.\n\nProsecutors allege Tekashi also helped Ellison and Mack carry out a 2018 gunpoint robbery of their gang rivals in Manhattan, filming the heist from a nearby car. And in court, the rapper admitted his role wasn\u2019t purely monetary.\n\n\u201cWe participated in a lot of crimes,\u201d the rapper testified. \u201cRobberies, assaults, drugs.\u201d\n\nTekashi, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, became a viral star in 2014 with unabashedly raunchy Instagram and YouTube videos that often featured guns and drugs. The Brooklyn-born rapper, who hit the mainstream music scene in 2016, is best known for his hit single last year with Nicki Minaj, \u201cFEFE.\u201d\n\nHe was arrested last year in a takedown of the Nine Trey Bloods and pleaded guilty in February to nine federal charges, including firearms offenses, racketeering, and drug counts. (The rapper also previously pleaded guilty in 2015 to child porn charges after filming a sexually explicit video with a 13-year-old girl\u2014a video he once said was intended to boost his \u201cscumbag\u201d persona and was \u201cjust for shock value.\u201d)\n\nAs part of the deal with federal prosecutors, Tekashi had to take the stand against reputed Nine Trey Bloods who opted for trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, he told jurors he was first introduced to the gang in 2017 through his former manager while taping a music video for his first hit single, \u201cGUMMO.\u201d He said once he found out his manager had a gang affiliation, he \u201casked if Nine Trey members would be in the video\u201d because he wanted their \u201caesthetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I wanted them to be wearing all red,\u201d Tekashi added, noting the color symbolizes the gang\u2019s Bloods affiliation. \u201cBefore I went to the house where we were shooting, I went to buy three dozen red bandanas for them to wear.\u201d\n\nAs prosecutors played the infamously rowdy, career-launching video, to point out notable gang members, Tekashi bopped his head to the beat, seemingly enjoying his own music.\n\nHe added that a month after \u201cGUMMO\u201d\u2019s \u201cinstant success,\u201d he created the music video for his hit \u201cKOODA\u201d and then \u201cwas officially a Nine Trey member.\u201d He eagerly translated various gang codes for the jury, showing off the secret handshake, and proudly listing the hierarchy of the Bloods lineage.\n\nBoth Mack and Ellison looked straight ahead, showing no emotion throughout Tekashi\u2019s testimony.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Rebold previously described Ellison as the \u201cmuscle and manager\u201d for Tekashi until he was ousted from the gang in July 2018\u2014a move that allegedly prompted Ellison kidnap and rob Tekashi for revenge.\n\nTekashi testified he was coming home from another video shoot when he was jumped by three men in hoodies who blocked off his car. He alleges the men hit him over the head with a pistol, before dragging him into their car and driving him around while demanding his money and jewelry. The rapper said they took about $750,000 worth of jewelry and $20,000 in cash.\n\nThe rapper\u2019s arrangement with the street gang allegedly disintegrated after that incident, just months before he and a dozen other alleged members were indicted on racketeering charges in November. He was asked when he decided to turn state\u2019s witness.\n\n\"The next day. The day after we were taken down,\" he said.\n\nDuring opening statements on Monday, defense attorneys slammed Tekashi as an unreliable witness and claimed he faked his own kidnapping for publicity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hoax!... It\u2019s a \u2018Jussie Smollett,\u2019 if you will,\u201d Deveraux Cannick, Ellison\u2019s attorney, said, referring to the former Empire star who made headlines this year after allegedly staging a fake hate crime against himself.\n\nTekashi is expected to continue his testimony on Wednesday. He is facing a minimum penalty of 47 years in prison but under the terms of his plea deal, he could serve far less.", "description": "The rapper took the stand and described how he bankrolled the gang that gave him street cred.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1237,w_2200,x_0,y_167/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568755751/GettyImages-1021309300_kyfoou", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
