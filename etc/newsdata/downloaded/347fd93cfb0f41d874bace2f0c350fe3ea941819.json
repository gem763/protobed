Nothing has moved. I'm ready to make things happen, man. I want to make Sacramento my home. I'm ready to get this s--- done. I want to be here and if it doesn't happen, then things can go the other way.\"\n\nPascal Siakam appears to be the new centerpiece for the Raptors. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Kings have an offer for Hield on the table for four years and $90 million, league sources told Yahoo Sports. Hield and his agent, Brandon Rosenthal, are seeking a number closer to $110 million, sources said.\n\nWith the 2020 free-agent class expected to be weak in terms of star power, sources said Hield is prepared to bet on himself and play out the season to test the market as a restricted free agent next summer if Monday\u2019s deadline passes without a deal in place.\n\nThe Kings re-signed forward Harrison Barnes in the offseason to a four-year, $85 million deal and franchise point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox will command a max rookie-scale extension July 1. According to The Bee, the Kings also have reportedly offered swingman Bogdan Bogdanovic a max extension of four years and $51.4 million. He has until June 30 to sign or become a restricted free agent.\n\nAs the team\u2019s leading scorer last season, Hield\u2019s representation is encouraging management to open up the checkbook to keep a relatively young core together.\n\nIf a deal doesn\u2019t happen by Monday, it could still happen nine months from now, but the Kings wouldn\u2019t be the only team making an offer.\n\nJaylen Brown and the Boston Celtics are on similar footing.\n\nDuring the first portion of negotiations, the No. 3 pick in the 2016 draft led his extension talks.\n\nBrown never signed with an agent after being drafted from the University of California. He has since hired Jason Glushon, a veteran agent who represents Philadelphia forward Al Horford and New Orleans guard Jrue Holiday.\n\nAs Marc Stein of the New York Times noted in his latest newsletter, the Celtics rarely issue extensions to their rookies, with Rajon Rondo being the last to receive one in 2009.\n\nBut even with history not on Brown\u2019s side, the Celtics have extended the 6-foot-7 swingman an offer of four years and $80 million, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nBut Brown believes in his ability to one day be a star and is pursuing a bigger offer, sources said. Next season the Celtics will have another major decision: figuring out if Jayson Tatum is worth the rookie-scale max.\n\nShould the 22-year-old Brown go the restricted free-agency route, he could end up being one of the top players on the market in July. Whatever he decides to do, he seems content and at peace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not overwhelming me or ruling my thoughts,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cI know what type of talent I have. I\u2019m confident in myself. I\u2019m confident in my ability. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s keeping me up at night.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "With a Monday extension deadline looming, Siakam appears in line for a deal, but Buddy Hield and Jaylen Brown may end up betting on themselves.", "authors": ["Chris Haynes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fdrJ82Au4N76j_BZzGhmaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uUV79QUuoZ8vus8NdGzZUA--~B/aD0yMTc5O3c9Mzg3NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/93e68ef0-f03e-11e9-b552-0589fdc846dc", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
