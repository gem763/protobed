He said he was struck by how few guards there were at the prison.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that really struck me today was how few guards there were,\" Hall said Friday on \u201cFox News Reporting.\u201d\n\n\"The SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces] has been clear they need more support when it comes to guarding these prisoners,\" Hall said, adding that half the guards at the prison camp he visited had to move north to try and repel the Turks earlier this month.\n\nThe Kurds said Turkish-backed forces are still attacking them despite a cease-fire, raising concerns that more ISIS fighters could escape prison. The Pentagon did, however, confirm this week that the U.S. would send more troops and tanks into Syria to guard oil fields there.\n\nPETER NAVARRO ON PENCE BLASTING NBA: AMERICANS HAVING 'EPIPHANY' ABOUT CHINA'S CONTROL\n\nThe prisoners Hall spoke to said they\u2019ve \u201cturned their back\u201d on the terror group, but the prison guards said that isn't true and that the prisoners are all still dangerous.\n\n\u201cThis is the story that you hear time and time again from these people,\" Hall said. \"They were cooks. They were cleaners. They didn't commit any atrocities.\"\n\nJOE BIDEN'S CLAIM ON MEETING ALL SANDY HOOK FAMILIES CALLED A 'LIE' BY VICTIM'S BROTHER\n\nThere are 14,000 ISIS fighters in prison and about 70,000 ISIS families, according to Hall.

Hall there are more than 50 different nationalities, and that he had spoken to Russians, Moroccans, Tunisians and British prisoners.\n\nHall asked one British prisoner what he would say to the families of those who had suffered at the hands of ISIS.\n\nCLICK HERE FOX THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard. What can I say? Whatever I say it\u2019s not going to be enough,\u201d the prisoner said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m sorry for the ones who are oppressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole experience was a mistake. It was a big mistake.
