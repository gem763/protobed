The camera pulls back, panning down her voluptuous cleavage then back to her mouth, just in time to see a saucy trickle hit her tongue. Captioned: \u201cI love a nice juicy weiner,\u201d this 10-second clip of Francia James eating a hot dog on her Instagram account has over a million views and thousands of comments. The flirty Playboy model has made a profitable career out of creating and posting salacious content that toes the line, selling sexual fantasies without actually having sex. James proves how being a naughty social-media star can be more lucrative than becoming a Playboy-model-turned-porn star, a route often taken by Playboy models in years past.\n\nTo hear James tell it, it wasn\u2019t so much a plan but something that just happened. \u201cI was working as an esthetician and a friend of mine was a new photographer. We started taking pictures and in less than six months, I had a million followers,\u201d says James, who currently boasts 2.4 million followers, and counting. A few months after they began working together, that same photographer friend sent her photos to Playboy, helping her land May\u2019s cover earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI was working by the hour on commission and as an esthetician you work so hard and you don\u2019t really make that much money,\u201d says James. \u201cI\u2019m so happy I\u2019m not doing that anymore.\u201d However, due to the often erotic nature of the content she creates, James\u2019 family struggles to accept her new career.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want me to be showing my booty. I\u2019m shaking my booty and shaking my boobies and they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening now, here [in the States] with social media,\u201d says James. Though James expresses a confidence\u2014or perhaps hope\u2014that her family (many of whom still reside in her native country of Colombia) will eventually see the positive side of her career, she\u2019s taking some protective measures until then. \u201cI blocked my mom from my Instagram. She\u2019s a very religious person in Colombia so I only send her the nice pictures I think she\u2019ll like,\u201d says James. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m doing something wrong; I just don\u2019t want her to see it. She\u2019s a mother like any other mother.\u201d\n\nAnd like any other daughter selling erotica, shielding mom from that content makes sense\u2014especially when that content leads to questions about porn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant question. Most of my followers ask me all the time, \u2018When are you going to do porn?\u2019 I have sexy stuff on my page but I don\u2019t see myself going into porn,\u201d says James. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m very happy with my Instagram and how it\u2019s going.\u201d Plus, what model would get into porn when the no-royalty flat rate for a penetrative hardcore scene is equal to or less than the compensation for a single post on Instagram?\n\n\u201c I usually get paid $1,500 for a post and companies don\u2019t just book you for one, they book you for a couple of stories and posts for that same company. It\u2019s good money. \u201d\n\nMaintaining Instagram-Star status and entertaining millions of followers is a 24/7 job and, surprisingly, it pays like one too. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be as much work as it is. With all this money it\u2019s constantly go go go but it\u2019s amazing how much you can do with this, if you want to do it,\u201d says James. \u201cI usually get paid $1,500 for a post and companies don\u2019t just book you for one, they book you for a couple of stories and posts for that same company. It\u2019s good money.\u201d\n\nTo make money selling posts on social media, you need to have followers\u2014a whole lot of followers. And that\u2019s what Francia James excels at: she knows how to attract and keep her millions happily tuning in. As James points out, \u201cOnce you get to a million followers, that\u2019s when you make money.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just about gaining the followers\u2014you have to keep them too, which means coming up with creative and engaging content nearly every single day. \u201cI have to post every day. I wake up and I have to post my stories. All day,\u201d says James. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the entertainment industry, you have to keep your followers happy.\u201d\n\nIt was the commitment to create content that both attracts and keeps her followers that has prompted James to make videos of her doing squats with an alligator slung across her shoulders, or to make a game of yanking her hot friend\u2019s pants down while they shop, or film twerking lessons bent over a barstool. Then there\u2019s the candid shots that seem spontaneously caught on camera (but we all know better, right?)\u2014and those sometimes take even more work to pull off.\n\nA bikini-clad model groped by an elephant as she tried to snap a picture with it went viral. James was, of course, the model, and though the set-up didn\u2019t go as planned, the filming turned out better than they\u2019d scripted. \u201cI drove for 10 hours with a friend of mine to see the tigers and elephants, to post about them. We wanted the elephant to grab my booty but she didn\u2019t want to do it. The elephant trainer had special candies the elephant liked, so we put it under my bra and that\u2019s how it happened. It looked like she was grabbing my boob but really she was just looking for her candy,\u201d recalls James. \u201cThat video has been all over the world, over 20 to 30 million people have seen it. That video has brought me a lot of work. The elephant grabbing my boob has been my best video so far.\u201d\n\nA copious amount of invisible work is done to craft a spontaneously caught moment, which is after all the job. \u201cIt took six takes and the crew trying to get the elephant to move just to do a 15-second video,\u201d recalls James. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize what goes on behind the scenes, or the money, work and time it takes to make this happen.\u201d", "description": "Francia James\u2019 photo and video content to her 2.4 million Instagram fans always pushes the envelope.
