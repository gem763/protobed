The school is one of the attractions in Dunleigh.\n\n\u201cI come home and the band\u2019s practicing right here,\u201d he said, pointing through a patch of woods.\n\nMiller\u2019s three children all graduated from Lake Braddock, one of three secondary schools in Fairfax County with grades seven through 12. Now that he\u2019s semi-retired, he hopes to work as a substitute teacher there about one day a week.\n\n\u201cWhen that [public address system] goes on, you hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a good neighbor.\u201d\n\n[In Montgomery County\u2019s Cloverly area, room to breathe and places to pray]\n\nDunleigh is a small neighborhood of 177 houses off Braddock Road just outside of the Capital Beltway. The houses all link to Dunleigh Drive either from cul-de-sacs off the road or pipestem driveways. A few older houses are from the late 1950s. But most were built by Guardian Construction in 1979 in the first phase or by another company in phase two. Two houses were added in recent years by a longtime homeowner with a big lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiller lives on Weetman Street, named for the family that originally owned the land.\n\nAt the entrance to Dunleigh is a historical marker that commemorates a Civil War skirmish that took place here on Dec. 4, 1861. Union troops from New Jersey stretched two telegraph wires across Braddock Road at night and caught Confederate troops from Georgia in the trap. During the ensuing battle, four Confederate soldiers were wounded and one was captured. Two Union soldiers were wounded, one was captured and another was killed.\n\nThe ambush was nicknamed the Battle of Bog Wallow, according to the diary of William Washington Gordon II, dated December 1861.\n\nSidewalks throughout the neighborhood are used frequently by neighbors. Miller said he sees \u201ca ton of people out walking their dogs\u201d around Dunleigh. Since it is not a through-road, there is no cut-through traffic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big thing,\u201d Miller said.\n\nA paved multiuse trail goes directly to the football field.\n\nStephanie Lusk has lived in Dunleigh for 15 years. She often walks her dog around the streets of Dunleigh.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s outside,\u201d she said.\n\n[D.C.\u2019s Takoma is a neighborhood that fought for diversity and still reaps its benefits]\n\nLusk walks to the store or a doctor\u2019s appointment in the office park two blocks away. She uses a cut-through to reach the Kings Park Library, too.\n\n\u201cYou could walk just about everywhere and get what you need,\u201d she said.\n\nLately she has noticed younger couples moving into the neighborhood and more mothers with strollers.\n\n\u201cWe have tons of babies,\u201d she said.\n\nOn any weekday during rush hour, traffic on Braddock Road is bumper-to-bumper between the Beltway and Route 123, west of Dunleigh Drive. With no traffic signal at Dunleigh Drive, cars wanting to head west on Braddock Road can struggle to make the turn.\n\n\n\nA wooded playground in the Dunleigh neighborhood. \u201cYou could walk just about everywhere and get what you need,\u201d said Stephanie Lusk, who has lived in Dunleigh for 15 years. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2017, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors endorsed a plan to remedy that. \u201cThis project will improve traffic flow on Braddock Road, add bicycle and pedestrian connectivity along the corridor, and increase access to transit and local destinations,\u201d Fairfax County officials wrote in their report to the board. The county expects to put $10 million toward initial work, with the hope that an additional $45.5 million will be funded through the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority, WTOP reported.\n\nThe plan includes improvements to intersections along Braddock Road as well as safer crossings at bus stops. Another part of the plan includes a pedestrian bridge over Braddock Road, east of Dunleigh Drive near the Kings Park Shopping Center.\n\nRemax agent Elizabeth Ann Kline was part of the team that listed a property at 5312 Dunleigh Dr. in September 2018, and the house was on the market for 37 days before selling. The proximity to Lake Braddock Secondary, the grocery store at Kings Park Shopping Center and Lake Braddock draw buyers, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a couple minutes to the Beltway,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, six houses sold in Dunleigh, ranging from a three-bedroom, four-bathroom, 1,344-square-foot Colonial for $580,000 to a five-bedroom, five-bathroom, 4,404-square-foot contemporary for $1 million.
