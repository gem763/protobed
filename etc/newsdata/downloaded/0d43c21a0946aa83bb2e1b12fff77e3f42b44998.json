Carlyle, which has invested in luxury brands such as ski jacket maker Moncler, has reportedly hired Bank of America as financial adviser. Golden Goose, Bank of America Corp and Carlyle didn't immediately return a FOX Business request for comment.\n\nDespite all the high-priced hype, some celebrity fashion stylists refuse to let their clients own a pair.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re paying me, I\u2019m not letting you buy them. You can look like crap on your own,\u201d New York City-based fashion consultant Amanda Sanders told FOX Business. \u201cThey look like dirty sneakers. The people who are age appropriate for the sneaker can\u2019t afford it, and the 30- and 40-year-olds wearing them don\u2019t look like luxury to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe brand has come under fire in the past for a look that critics have said seems to \u201cmock poverty.\"\n\nDespite the backlash, shoppers with money to blow are spending it on the worn-out footwear. Nordstrom sold out of a $530 pair of Golden Goose that appeared to have mud stains and tape holding them together. The website described the \"distressed leather sneakers\" as having \u201ccrumply, hold-it-all together tape.\"\n\nSanders says the quality of the shoes is hardly worth anything close to the price tag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re super comfortable or there\u2019s extra padding in them. There\u2019s nothing special. If I\u2019m spending $700, I want it to look like it.\u201d\n\nThere's a market of people who feel differently, enough of one for competing designers to adopt the style: Gucci released a pair of sneakers made to look like they had mud stains for $870, while Steve Madden sold a version of the worn-out athletic shoes for $178.\n\nThe best deal may be in the second-hand market. One owner is re-selling a pair for $55 on Poshmark.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP is considering the sale of Golden Goose, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/golden-goose-sneakers-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
