Thompson, of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, a Jimmy Carter appointee, blocked Alabama\u2019s Human Life Protection Act that was set to take effect on November 15.\n\nThe law would make most abortions in the state at any point during pregnancy illegal, except those necessary in order to prevent \u201ca serious health risk to the unborn child\u2019s mother.\u201d\n\nThe law, Thompson said, would have caused \u201cserious and irreparable harm,\u201d reported UPI.\n\nICYMI: None of the state abortion bans passed earlier this year have gone into effect. #StopTheBans pic.twitter.com/0akC4DeLUQ \u2014 ACLU (@ACLU) October 30, 2019\n\nWe said it from the start: this ban is blatantly unconstitutional and today we BLOCKED it from going into effect. If Alabama politicians \u2014 or ANY politicians \u2014 try it again, we'll continue to fight them every step of the way. #BansOffMyBodyhttps://t.co/KPHHyQXTKx \u2014 Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) October 29, 2019\n\nHowever, as Breitbart News\u2019 Jeff Poor wrote in May, the Alabama legislature, like that of the other states that passed serious abortion restrictions, hoped not only to save the lives of babies and their mothers, but also to serve as a challenge to the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, in which the Court invented a right to abortion when none ever existed in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe way that this bill is drafted \u2013 it goes to ask the question of personhood,\u201d said Alabama Sen. Clyde Chambliss (R), one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, during a radio interview at WVNN at the time.\n\nChambliss said:\n\nThe 14th Amendment gives people, a person the right to life, liberty and property. But it doesn\u2019t say when a person becomes a person. Obviously, if somebody is walking around, we know that\u2019s a person. In the womb, do we know if that is a person or not? Unborn babies can hear, they can feel \u2013 at what point can they hear and feel and think and feel pain. And so, we need some guidance. We need some guidance. We need some guidance from the Supreme Court. So, this bill has been drafted so that it goes directly to that question. It goes to the Supreme Court, hopefully. And we do expect it to be ruled unconstitutional at the lower court. It has to be. It has no choice because they have to follow Supreme Court precedent. That\u2019s no surprise. We know that\u2019s going to happen. We know that will be found unconstitutional on appeal, but hopefully, we\u2019ll have the Supreme Court to take up the matter. And we hope and we feel that the Supreme Court will rule this law constitutional because it gets to that personhood issue that is so, so important.\n\nAlabama State Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored the bill in her chamber, also said the bill\u2019s intention is \u201cto confront a decision that was made by the courts in 1973 that said the baby in the womb is not a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill addresses that one issue,\u201d she added. \u201cIs that baby in the womb a person? I believe our law says it is. I believe our people say it is. And I believe technology shows it is.\u201d\n\nIn a statement sent to Breitbart News, pro-life leader Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, echoed those sentiments.\n\n\u201cThis is not at all surprising, and in fact it\u2019s par for the course,\u201d Pavone said. \u201cEvery time a federal judge blocks an abortion law, Americans are reminded about the importance of having a pro-life president in the White House \u2013 for two terms \u2013 and a pro-life Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen all of President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees are seated, it will no longer be par for the course for life-saving laws to be blocked,\u201d he added. \u201cWe look forward to that day.\u201d", "description": "The ACLU celebrated the blocking of an Alabama law banning most abortions \u2013 one of seven bans passed this year that have been struck down.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/abortion-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
