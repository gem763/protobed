We think that the buildout of next day delivery is likely to take several quarters, and don't expect a return to outsized profits anytime soon,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.\n\nAmazon's median price target is $2,220, a 33% premium to where its shares are indicated to open. The shares are trading down at $1,734.70.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's profit: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AMAZON-STOCKS/0H001QXF593G/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon was again hurt by heavy investments to speed up deliveries to its Prime members as it tries to beat back Walmart Inc, which is swiping market share.\n\nAmazon expects costs to cater to Prime members to nearly double to $1.5 billion during the holiday season from what it spent on one-day delivery during the second quarter.\n\nThe company reported sales growth of 24% to $70 billion in the third quarter, but its prediction of $80 billion to $86.5 billion sales in the fourth quarter fell short of the $87.4 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nHoliday sales typically pull in a major share of retailers' revenue and profit.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's holiday quarter: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AMAZON-STOCKS/0H001QXF2936/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon also disappointed on slower revenue growth for Amazon Web Services, the company's traditionally lucrative cloud business.\n\nDaniel Liu, research analyst at Canalys, said Microsoft Corp's Azure cloud business narrowed its gap with AWS during the third quarter. AWS accounts for nearly a third of the global cloud market.\n\nAWS revenue grew by 35% year-on-year and came in slightly below Microsoft's Commercial Cloud revenue growth of 36%, according to Shebly Seyrafi, CFA Managing Director, Technology & Internet Research at FBN Securities .\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's cloud business: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AMAZON-STOCKS/0H001QXF3939/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\nMost analysts, however, stood by Amazon's long-term prospects.\n\nNicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said Amazon's revenue continues to grow at an astonishing, and for rival retailers probably alarming, rate, adding that robust cash generation meant that Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos would be unfazed.\n\n\"Whether all the extra investment will be worth it in the end is perhaps open to question, especially given the lackluster sales guidance for next quarter. But it's been foolish to doubt Amazon in the past,\" Hyett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive graphic on Amazon's costs: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/AMAZON-STOCKS/0H001QXF493D/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain, Uday Sampath and Ambhini Aishwarya in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)", "description": "\"Going forward, it is difficult to assess when Amazon will once again begin to deliver profit upside.
