Fire chief Tim McConnell said it was hoped they would find the two missing people alive.\n\nMcConnell said only part of the building was considered stable. A 270ft crane looming over the wreckage was also in danger of collapse, further complicating rescue efforts.\n\nCity officials and Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards confirmed the fatality. Authorities said around 20 people were taken to a hospital for treatment. All were considered stable. One man who had been unaccounted for turned out to have been at a local hospital.\n\nThe building was under construction at the corner of Rampart Street and Canal Street, a broad boulevard just outside the Quarter lined with restaurants hotels and retailers. Canal, which carries six lanes of traffic divided by a wide median where streetcars roll, separates the Quarter from the main business district.\n\nWWL-TV aired a viewer\u2019s dramatic video of the collapse, showing upper floors falling on top of each other before one side of the building toppled to the ground.\n\nAnother video on social media was taken by someone aboard a streetcar as it approached the site. It showed what looked like a metal structure or a piece of construction equipment tumbling and people running from the scene as clouds of dust billowed up, obscuring the view.\n\n\u201cIt was a deep rumbling sound,\u201d Matt Worges, who saw the collapse from a nearby building, told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate.\n\n\u201cLike an airplane maybe. It drew my head immediately.\u201d\n\nEvacuees included guests at a hostel across the street from the damaged building.\n\n\u201cI heard a huge noise and thought it was a plane crashing. Then, the hostel shook,\u201d said Sue Hurley, 68. She said she was reminded of news accounts of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAnother hostel guest, Michael Arbeiter, 30, from Munich, Germany, said he was just getting out of the shower when the room shook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened but they told us to get out of here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to stay until Monday. Thank God it was not another 9/11.\u201d\n\nEdwards urged people to stay away from the area, which was considered unstable. An unsupported crane listed away from the building site. As dust settled, twisted metal, concrete pilings and other wreckage covered part of Rampart Street.", "description": "Hard Rock hotel was under construction in Louisiana city and site still considered unstable after one side of building falls to ground", "authors": ["Associated Press In New Orleans"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fd977b1b6855bdd87f7544aa039242d11e4be82/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50286496c7018097683128beb920ddcf", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
