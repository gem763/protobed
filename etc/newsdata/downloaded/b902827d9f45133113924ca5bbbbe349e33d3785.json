Yes, yes. That we know. But wait. The job also calls for nonstop news-mongering in a news cycle that is endless, random and often unpredictable in its trajectory.\n\nThe question: Have the rigors of the job taken a toll on the nation\u2019s journalists? New research indicates the answer is yes. Members of the American press corps appear more jittery than their peers around the planet.\n\nAccording to a new global survey of 1,999 journalists working in print, broadcast and digital news organizations in 10 countries, 49% overall believe freedom of the press has deteriorated in their home countries. Among U.S. journalists, that number jumps to 57%.\n\nMeanwhile, 36% of the global population of journalists are increasingly concerned for their personal safety and the safety of journalists in general. Among the American press, it\u2019s 42%.\n\nOn the reliability front, 63% of the international press believe the public has lost trust in journalists. Their U.S. brethren, however, appear to feel the sting a little more.\n\n\u201c69% of U.S. journalists believe that the public has lost trust in the media in the last year. However that number is down from 78% in 2018, highlighting journalists\u2019 belief that they\u2019re regaining trust, despite constant attacks,\u201d the analysis noted, describing the past year as \u201cchallenging for the media industry\u201d due to misinformation, social media pressures and other factors.\n\nThe extensive research was conducted in April; the information was released Thursday by Cision, a global analytics and media software organization based in Chicago.\n\nNEWS TIP\n\nIt was just another trip to California, but one with a little insight about the current president of the United States who is both world leader and canny businessman. A Reuters photo of President Trump entering Air Force One this week revealed an interesting detail: some $20 bills peeking out of Mr. Trumps\u2019s back pocket. The onboard press corps was immediately curious about this phenomenon. Inquiries commenced on the flight back to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe president was candid with his response.\n\n\u201d I do like leaving tips to the hotel. I like to carry a little something. I like to give tips to the hotel. I\u2019m telling you, maybe a president is not supposed to do it \u2014 but I like to leave a tip for the hotel,\u201d Mr. Trump advised the assembled journalists.\n\nA SAVAGE MOMENT\n\nAir Force One was the site of another vignette this week. Veteran talk radio host Michael Savage took a ride on the magnificent aircraft with President Trump. The pair talked, they had lunch. Mr. Savage then accompanied Mr. Trump to a fundraiser in California, and here is what he said about an experience that yielded both wonder and insight to the radio man.\n\n\u201cSitting in one of those cars going down the highways and on the local roads, you might expect to see people holding evil signs about Trump. But rather, you see school children cheering the president\u2019s motorcade as it goes by. But we never see that on the evening news or any of the cable channels. But I witnessed it,\u201d Mr. Savage explains.\n\n\u201cWe all know we have never seen such a perversion of the truth as we have around this president. I learned things about his accomplishments that I never knew. The media created a lie and spread it each and every day. As Joseph Goebbels once said, \u2018If you tell a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.\u2019 After two-and-a-half years of relentless hatred, the false witch hunt, threatening to put this president in prison and his children in prison, lies about Russia collusion, President Trump looks stronger than ever,\u201d Mr. Savage continues.\n\n\u201cHe looks better than he did when I first met him. They tried to destroy him and his family, and they failed,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething is happening in this country, and it is going in the other direction, it is going in our direction. It is going in the direction of America\u2019s survival.\u201d\n\nHERE COMES THE SPACE FORCE\n\nThose with institutional memory of a previous era may wonder: Will the new Space Force revisit SDI? For the uninitiated, that acronym stands for Strategic Defense Initiative. It was proposed by President Reagan in 1983 and included advanced space-based interceptor and sensor systems to counter incoming Soviet ballistic missiles, among other things.\n\nMeanwhile, there is some news about the Space Force.\n\nThe beginnings of the potential sixth branch of the armed forces should be up and running in about 90 days with an initial forward staff of 200 according to Defense One, which reviewed defense documents on the start-up.\n\nThe team will include 151 folks from the Air Force, 24 from the Army, 14 from the Navy and Marine Corps, and nine from the Joint Staff. Their mission and who will drive it, however, is a work in progress.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of conversation going on about the mission, the vision, on what does it do?\u201d noted Lt. Gen. David \u201cDT\u201d Thompson, vice commander of Air Force Space Command. And a lot of what is being said is inaccurate, he told SpaceNews this week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a role for the Space Force, a role for DoD, for NASA, for the commercial market, the intelligence community, the Department of Commerce,\u201d the officer said, explaining that the Space Force over time \u201cwill have a large role to play, but to say it\u2019s going to be the Space Force\u2019s job to take us in this direction is well beyond what we\u2019ve ever asked for.\u201d\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale: Historic post-and-beam clapboard farmhouse with fieldstone foundation, built on 1783 on 19 acres near Hancock, New Hampshire.
