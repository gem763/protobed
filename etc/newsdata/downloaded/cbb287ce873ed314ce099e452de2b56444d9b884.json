Peloton's bikes come with a touchscreen tablet meant to show just one type of video: Peloton's rotation of personal trainers shouting words of encouragement.\n\nThese workout videos are packaged with preselected music and software that tracks cyclists' speed, and sold for a $39-per-month subscription on top of the cost of a stationary bike. This is the only software that Peloton intends its users to access while spinning.\n\nBut some users are jailbreaking their Pelotons to get around those parameters.\n\nFor some, this means \"rooting\" the Android-based tablet attached to the Peloton to access apps like Netflix and Spotify instead of Peloton's own software.\n\nOthers are seemingly hacking the exercise bikes to artificially log impressive race times and shoot to the top of the service's leaderboard rankings, much to the annoyance of the broader Peloton community.\n\nThe practice of jailbreaking cycles is relatively niche, but it illustrates how people are finding ways to use products outside the traditional business model of Peloton, which relies on subscribers paying to use the services that the cycles' tablets are intended for.", "description": "Some people are rooting the tablets attached to their Pelotons to use them for purposes other than what the company intended.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8ce7e52e22af62bf30d60b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
