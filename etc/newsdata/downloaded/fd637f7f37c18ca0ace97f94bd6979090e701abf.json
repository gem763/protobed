Lorenzo gives his locks for the weekend. USA TODAY\n\nWith Drew Brees still out with a ligament issue in his thumb, the Saints can use all the help they can get. Well, they may have gotten it from an unexpected place thanks to the magic of Twitter promotions. New Orleans is the underdog heading into its matchup with the Jacksonville Jaguars, but you might see that line (+2.5) start to move after the AFC South team got a blessing from\u2026 THE VATICAN.\n\nPope Francis decided to hashtag the word \"Saints\" in a tweet he sent out Sunday morning, which is included in the NFL's Twitter emoji program, making it appear as if the tweet was dedicated to the New Orleans football team.\n\nI'm just assuming this is a tweet about Teddy Bridgewater, who has stepped in for the injured Brees and led the Saints to a 4-1 record. Bridgewater is coming off the best game of the season, and, having joined the team in 2018, could be considered a \"new Saint.\"\n\nToday we give thanks to the Lord for our new #Saints. They walked by faith and now we invoke their intercession. \u2014 Pope Francis (@Pontifex) October 13, 2019\n\nThe Pontiff is probably already regretting his use of the hashtag after it flooded his mentions with the most depraved people on earth.
