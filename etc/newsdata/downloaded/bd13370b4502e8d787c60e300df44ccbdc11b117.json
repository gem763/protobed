Formerly thought of as one of the royal family\u2019s \u201cmost elusive\u201d members, Kate Middleton\u2019s 1-year-old baby has emerged from his shell in the past year doing such things as: wearing a sweater with a little doggy on it; wearing big sunglasses on his baby head like a tiny little man; supposedly wishing Charlotte (the royal child, not York-Goldenblatt) a happy birthday; and, of course, being christened. But \u2014 what\u2019s this? Oh, what\u2019s this? Now it seems Kate Middleton would like to share another of the things the small royal does, or at least has done.\n\nOn Tuesday, the duchess unveiled her new \u201cBack to Nature\u201d garden in Surrey; the garden is the third she has designed and is part of her campaign to encourage kids to play outside. The celebration included a tractor ride with Mary Berry of the Great British Baking Show. It also included the spilling of certain beans related to a garden activity young Prince Louis enjoys.\n\nAccording to People, an attendee named Sarah Griffiths said Kate Middleton spoke to her about one of Prince Louis\u2019s most beloved activities. \u201cShe was telling us how her son Louis loves \u2014,\u201d Griffiths told People.\n\n\u201cLoves \u2026 what?!\u201d you\u2019re thinking. Well, do you have a guess? This might be a good opportunity for you to engage in some creative thinking. What would a baby love? Put yourself in the shoes of a baby, maybe, and see what you think. Hmm. If I didn\u2019t already know the answer, I can tell you that these would be my guesses:\n\nButtoning the Buttons on His Coat\n\nNow that I think about it, I\u2019m not sure babies love this as much as I love to see babies do it. I haven\u2019t spoken to a baby about how they use their tiny fingies to button their coat and whether they enjoy it, but I do believe babies probably enjoy completing small tasks. Plus, babies need to wear coats outside when it\u2019s cold. I would think that it could be this. Though, actually, some light research concludes Prince Louis might be too young. The website Planning With Kids says:\n\nChildren are able to start dressing themselves from about 2 and a half to 3 years of age. It may be as simple as pulling on a sock or jacket. Giving them practise is useful without it having to become a regimented ordeal for the child.\n\nBut he could be advanced.\n\nShowing Where the Ground and Sky Are\n\n\u201cWhere is the ground? Where is the sky?\u201d The baby points down, the baby points up. This could be a game you play with a baby, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nHaving a Snack\n\nHaving a snack in the garden sounds just as nice for a 1-year-old as it does for an adult. And it would be easy to know Prince Louis loved it: He\u2019s making mmm noises, having a happy face, etc. Emoting about the snack.\n\nTaking a Nap\n\nSimilar to the snack idea, in a way.\n\n\u201cBut \u2014 okay, I have my own guesses. What does he love?\u201d you\u2019re thinking. Well, okay. Did you write down your guesses? I would suggest writing them down and signing the paper to keep yourself honest.
