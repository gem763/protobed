It may not be what you expected because you wanted him to go to (Heroes Acre) but what we have done is our father's wishes.\"\n\nMnangagwa, who was represented by government officials, had initially pushed for Mugabe to be buried at the monument for liberation war heroes - an occasion political analysts and ZANU-PF party sources said Mnangagwa wanted to use to display a public reconciliation with Mugabe's admirers.\n\nMugabe's family had since the arrival of his body from Singapore, kept vigil over his remains because the former president had expressed fears to close family members before his death that some of the people who ousted him would seek to conduct a traditional ritual with some of his body parts, Mugabe's nephew Leo Mugabe said.\n\nZANU-PF spokesman Simon Khaya Moyo said in a statement that the decision to bury Mugabe in Kutama was most unfortunate, in a sign of the continued fall-out between the ruling party and the family.\n\n\"We indeed respect the wishes of the families of deceased heroes, hence get saddened when maneuvers that border on political gimmicks begin to unfold on an issue concerning an illustrious liberation icon,\" Khaya Moyo said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Clelia Oziel)", "description": "Zimbabwe's founding leader Robert Mugabe was buried on Saturday in his home village of Kutama, ending a dispute between his family and the government of his successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa over his final resting place.
