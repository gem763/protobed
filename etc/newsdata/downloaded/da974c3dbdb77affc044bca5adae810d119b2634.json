REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - China\u2019s copper imports in September rose 10.15% from a month earlier to 445,000 tonnes, the highest level in eight months, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Monday.\n\nCopper purchases by China, the world\u2019s leading copper and aluminum consumer, include anode, refined, alloy and semi-finished copper products.\n\nThe country exported 435,000 tonnes of unwrought aluminum and aluminum products, including primary, alloy and semi-finished aluminum products, in September, down from August\u2019s 466,000 tonnes.\n\nArrivals of unwrought copper, including anode, refined and semi-finished copper products into China, stood at 445,000 tonnes last month, the General Administration of Customs said.\n\nThat was up from 404,000 tonnes in August but down 14.6% from a bumper 521,000 tonnes in September last year, which was the highest monthly total since March 2016.\n\nChina\u2019s factory activity shrank for a fifth month in September, pointing to persistent pressure on the world\u2019s second-biggest economy and its copper-intensive manufacturing sector amid a bruising trade war with the United States.\n\nHowever, Shanghai copper prices SCFcv1 edged up 0.7% over September and have averaged higher than London prices in recent months, giving traders an opportunity to arbitrage, or profit, from the price difference by shipping metal into China.
