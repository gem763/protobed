Some are included below; Sonni to Renner: 'I would just like to know if you have my things, my passport etc. because if not I need to file a police report because I am worried someone took them' Renner: 'I swear I just saw it somewhere. Maybe my safe perhaps. I can't be sure.' Sonni: 'If you can check that would be great. Thx.' Renner: 'All Good here. Think about my offer. We can negotiate' Sonni: Can I grab my things before bed please? I have an apt. with the DMV and need my belonging. Renner: 'I told you the terms in which I can help you.

I need my belonging (sic) back. You are not allowed to take someone's personal property. Renner: 'I have no idea what you're speaking about. Everything is safe as far as I know. Sonni: 'If you keep acting like this I will get another party involved. You are not mature enough to handle this alone so I need to take action. Renner: You said you already did. You started this unpleasant sink by saying that. I now (sic) how to defend myself. You drew first blood. Sorry.' Sonni: Ava's passport is in your safe along with mine.... why are you holding my stuff hostage? Let's be adults and not make this a public matter. Renner: All is safe. And your threats are noted and acknowledged. Sonni: We both deserve better so let's set each other free. Renner: Ha ha ha. I have NO idea what you're saying but you're funny. Sonni: Your (sic) welcome for your 2 hour long massage last night. And thank you for dropping me off on the road today and not even getting in contact to see if I was safe. Renner: Are you a victim all the sudden? (sic)...Put your claws away tiger. Nothing to scratch here. Sonni: I'm never a victim. I'm strong as (sic) women (sic) that puts up with your bipolar episodes. Renner: I'll put your victimized excuses in my pocket with the REST of them... by the way calling the kettle black. YOUR family is touched by the bi polar disorder. I only pray that this unfortunate gene isn't passed to our baby.... You can run. But you cannot hide Pacheco.\n\nHe allegedly told someone he 'could not deal with her anymore', and he 'just wanted her gone'.\n\nShe also alleges that the Avengers actor abuses drugs and alcohol and has a history of emotionally and verbally abusing her.\n\nThe former couple had agreed to joint custody, however, Sonni is now pushing to be the sole carer for Ava and only allowing Jeremy supervised visits.\n\nRenner allegedly hit out at Ava's nanny, threatening her with his suicide.\n\n'Because of you [the nanny]. You're the reason I pulled the trigger. Do you think if my blood and brains are all over my bedroom floor, do you think you would be living this lifestyle in this mansion,' the nanny reported Renner saying, according to TMZ.\n\nRenner has denied all of the allegations against him and fired back in his own legal documents, saying his wife is acting out of spite because she is bitter that they broke up.\n\nHe said he does not abuse drugs or alcohol and says he even submitted to random drug testing to prove it.\n\nRenner also, according to TMZ, hit back at a disturbing allegation he says his ex is making - that he sexually and physically abused Ava.\n\nHe says she used to brag to friends about 'bagging an Avenger' and that she plans her attacks on him to coincide with the release of his movies so that she gets the publicity.\n\nThe star added that she was 'obsessed' with demonizing him.\n\nRenner and Pacheco married in 2014, a year after Ava was born. They separated the same year.\n\nLast year they reached a new agreement on child support to last through 2020.\n\nThe star was originally paying $13,000 a month, but now if his yearly income exceeds $2.3 million, five percent will go to his ex.\n\nUnder the agreement, his payments to Pacheco will never exceed $200,000 per year.\n\nAny excess will go into an account for their daughter.\n\nWith funds initially going towards her education, any money left over will be hers to use freely once she turns 27.\n\nRenner told Playboy in 2015 that his time with his daughter is when he is happiest.\n\n'When it's Daddy and Ava time, that's all I do,' Jeremy gushed.\n\n'You're talking to a guy who's really happy in his f***ing flip-flops right now with his little daughter in her pajamas running around in the house, waiting for me.'\n\nAmong claims made by Pacheco is that he once had a threesome in his home after taking a hot tub with a woman and a 'mutual friend'.\n\nLily Faget, a friend of Renner's, also said she had seen the star get drunk and take cocaine while Ava was in the house \u2013 and admitted to taking part in a threesome with the star.\n\nShe claimed that she had seen Renner pass out drunk during a party \u2013 only for Ava to come downstairs and start asking for her father.\n\nFaget said in October 2018 she was drinking in Renner's hot tub with him and a mutual friend, and that the Avengers star was drunk.\n\nLegal documents said that Pachecho has requested a separate room where her depositions and the depositions of Ava's nanny can be taken, adding that she wouldn't feel safe without it\n\n'At one point in the night, [Renner] and my friend and I went into Respondent's music studio and the three of us started having sex,' Faget wrote.\n\n'I left the studio (leaving my friend and [Renner] in there) and saw [Ava's nanny] Naomi sitting at the outside bar with a few men. All of a sudden I saw Ava walk into the living room next to the bar, asking for [Renner].\n\n'Naomi swooped her up and walked out of the room. I was so shocked that Ava was there and that no one told me to be mindful that Ava was in the house. I went back into the music studio (where [Renner] had the music on very loud) and saw that [he] had passed out. I had to help my friend pull [his] pants up.'", "description": "Jeremy Renner's ex-wife, Sonni Pachecho, feels threatened by the Avengers actor and is seeking protection in their upcoming depositions, claiming that she won't feel safe without them.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/09/20171798-0-image-a-2_1571993465374.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
