What\u2019s of immediate concern is the chilling effect and the further entrenchment of self-censorship,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nAfter the law was passed in May, Google said it was concerned the legislation will \u201churt innovation and the growth of the digital information ecosystem\u201d.\n\nA group of nearly 100 academics worldwide also expressed concern over the law, warning earlier this year that it could threaten academic freedom.\n\nActivists fear the law could be used to crack down on dissent in the run-up to elections in Singapore, which are expected within months.", "description": "Legislation gives government power to order social media sites to put warnings next to posts authorities deem to be false", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65d3d36fa15f8962432676422fef04653ba1f065/0_0_2907_1744/master/2907.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d52c3c9b95a7d2e8ef5d675381ae2e13"}
