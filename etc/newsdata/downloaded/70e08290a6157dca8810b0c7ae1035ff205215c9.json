She can need suctioned or ventilated and she can need oxygen too. Gaby cannot sleep on her own without someone to watch her.\n\n\u201cAt the age of five she has already had three open heart surgeries and life is hard for her. But she never complains although she is starting to notice that other kids are not ventilated like her. So it\u2019s heartbreaking to try to explain what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cWe were offered 110 hours of care for her every week but I said we would mange with 70 but now I\u2019ve been told that when Gaby\u2019s carers, who we love, are on annual leave or are sick, we will have no one to cover for them.\n\n\u201cThat leaves us in a pretty impossible situation. I\u2019m really not someone to complain about getting help but perhaps that\u2019s why we\u2019re in this position and now we\u2019re at breaking point.\n\n\u201cWe have just spent the weekend doing night shifts so that means staying awake to watch Gaby sleep, doing her medicines, monitoring her oxygen levels, all the things she needs done to live her life as normally as possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told the South Eastern Care Trust cannot cover the sick leave and we also have no cover three nights of this coming week because there is no cover for annual leave.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s five out of eight nights uncovered.\n\n\u201cI have been told that the Trust has advised not to cover annual leave or sick leave in Gaby\u2019s package and then I was told everyone is in the same boat.\n\n\u201cIf I could be my daughter\u2019s classroom assistant in school and her full-time carer day and night at home, and cover any sick or annual leave for night time hours, I would. But I physically cannot stay awake 24 hours a day nor can her daddy David who works full-time to support our family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m exhausted and I feel angry and I feel like we are being picked out for saying nothing and not making a fuss.\n\n\u201cMy little girl deserves so much more and so do her brothers, they all deserve a mummy who is not too tired to play or take them out without dreading it because of the stress I am under.\n\n\u201cAnd anyone that knows me knows that I\u2019m normally quiet and I do all I can try to make people\u2019s lives easier, but my children are suffering here and I need the help that was promised to us as a family.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said: \u201cThe lead nurse is going to meet mum at 1pm tomorrow to discuss this case further. In relation to queries below -\n\n\u201cThe Children's Community Nursing Team works in partnership with all parents to ensure care packages are adequately covered, either by the parents or other staff.\n\n\u201cParents are informed of annual leave a number of weeks in advance and arrangements agreed for the cover, parents often wish to cover this themselves.\n\n\u201cSick leave is more difficult to be covered at short notice, but will be covered as soon as possible in the event of a prolonged period of sickness, working in partnership with the parents.\n\nThere is no moratorium on cover within care packages. The Trust will continue to work directly with mum to agree the support package required.\n\n\"All community support packages are individualised and agreed with each user. The Trust has been in contact with the family today and will continue until the matter is resolved.\u201d", "description": "Gaby Irvine, five, needs round-the-clock care to ensure she is able to breathe and has already had three open heart surgeries in her short life", "authors": ["Jilly Beattie"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20751441.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Gaby-Irvine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
