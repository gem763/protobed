The rarely-seen photos from Carrie's wedding dress fitting.\n\n\"We would definitely make a case for the more colorful, ornate options (LaCroix, we're assuming?) which speak to Ms. Bradshaw's anti-establishment streak. But then again, being jilted at the altar in a white poufy gown is inifinitely more humiliating.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to pick the story over the fashion\u2060\u2014even on Sex and the City.\"\n\nMore than 37,000 people have liked the post, with many fans sharing their amazement over the photos.\n\nOne person wrote: \"These are stunning!\"\n\nAnother commented: \"Number 2 slays my life tbh.\"\n\nAnd even SJP herself has replied to the post.\n\nThe star wrote: \"Ok. Wait a minute. We have so much to discuss. I\u2019m gathering thoughts. WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE PHOTOS??? The mother load!! X, sj.\"\n\nNow if you need us, we'll be re-watching the Sex and the City movie on Netflix for the millionth time...", "description": "Several rarely seen behind-the-scenes photos from Carrie Bradshaw's wedding dress fitting have been doing the rounds online", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Splash News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12002738.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_On-Location-for-Sex-and-the-City-The-Movie-September-21-2007.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
