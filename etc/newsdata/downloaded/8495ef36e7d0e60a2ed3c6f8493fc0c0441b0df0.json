When I\u2019m president, we will implement solutions bold enough to meet the challenges the LGBTQ+ community faces while bringing the American people together to understand that our freedoms are bound up in each other.\u201d\n\nCombined, the proposals amount to the most in-depth LGBT policy outline released by any White House hopeful so far, and draw a sharp contrast with the policies of President Donald Trump, many of which Buttigieg pledges to undo if elected.\n\nTrump, who has fashioned himself since his 2016 presidential campaign as a history-making ally of LGBT people, has largely dealt with LGBT issues in the same manner as previous Republican presidents, including a spur-of-the-moment tweet announcing that \u201ctransgender individuals\u201d would no longer be allowed \u201cto serve in any capacity in the U.S. military,\u201d ending protections for transgender students in public schools, and just this week arguing before the Supreme Court that sex discrimination protections should not be used to prevent discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender Americans.\n\nThe president\u2019s most prominent gay allies have dismissed Buttigieg\u2019s past attacks on the administration\u2019s record\u2014as well his hits against Vice President Mike Pence, a fellow Hoosier who signed a bill that provided legal cover for anti-LGBT discrimination\u2014as \u201copportunism\u201d afforded by his status as a gay candidate.\n\n\u201cWhen it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg remained in the closet. When it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg came out as gay,\u201d former Log Cabin Republicans president Gregory T. Angelo told The Daily Beast in April. \u201cWhen it benefited his political career, Buttigieg was more than happy to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mike Pence as allies, and when it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg was more than happy to throw his longtime friendship with Mike Pence under the bus and criticize him.\u201d\n\nButtigieg, who has in the past said that he doesn\u2019t want to be constrained by the label of \u201cthe Gay Candidate,\u201d is far from the only Democratic presidential candidate to have called for an end to Trump-era LGBT policies.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, whose public call for same-sex marriage helped force President Barack Obama come out publicly in support of marriage equality, has publicly stated that his top legislative priority would be the passage of the Equality Act, which would protect LGBT people from legal discrimination. In a video message recorded for attendees of RuPaul\u2019s DragCon, Sen. Elizabeth Warren specifically cited ongoing violence against trans women of color as a crisis that the next president must address. Warren released her policy plan for LGBT issues on Thursday morning as well.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 track record on LGBT issues while in the Senate is nearly unimpeachable, including votes both against the Defense of Marriage Act and so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d legislation that barred out servicemembers from the U.S. military.\n\nBut in addition to proposals that have become established Democratic legislative priorities, Buttigieg\u2019s agenda includes major priorities among LGBT advocacy groups and individuals that have never been invoked by any major presidential candidate: repealing a federal ban on blood donation by gay and bisexual men, requiring health care coverage of gender-affirming care for transgender people, and decriminalizing the transmission of HIV.\n\n\u201cFor LGBTQ+ people, like for other marginalized groups, the political has always been extremely personal,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThis is why our policy is inspired by LGBTQ+ people\u2019s stories: by the war that breaks out in the heart of a young person when they realize that a basic fact about them makes them more likely to be feared, and the immense joy that comes with finally knowing with certainty that you belong.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s LGBT proposals also touch on other policy initiatives, including his proposal to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals released earlier this week. The plan would increase the accessibility and affordability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily pill that vastly decreases HIV transmission rates but is often out of reach for uninsured people who can\u2019t afford the medication\u2019s $1,600 monthly pricetag.\n\n\u201cIf pharmaceutical companies selling PrEP therapies refuse to ensure affordable access for all Americans, a Buttigieg administration will pursue aggressive price negotiations in line with our broader drug pricing strategies,\u201d the proposal declares. \u201cIf those negotiations fail, given the vital public health role of PrEP as an HIV prevention tool, Pete will consider exercising eminent domain on PrEP-related patents.\u201d\n\nThe legislative laundry list of to-dos in the proposal\u2014including a nationwide ban on so-called \u201cconversion therapy\u201d and firming up protections for LGBT asylum seekers\u2014serves as a lengthy reminder of policies that have largely fallen by the wayside under both Democratic and Republican administrations. Buttigieg frames that dynamic, alternating between dismissal and hostility, as making LGBT people feel isolated, unprotected, and less free.\n\n\u201cWhat does our country look like to a teenager in 2019, just starting to realize who they are? What future do they see for themselves?\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThey see a government that is allowing clinicians to refuse to treat patients who are LGBTQ+. They see a president who, when asked about LGBTQ+ rights by a reporter, joked of his vice president: \u2018Don\u2019t ask that guy\u2014he wants to hang them all!\u2019\u2026 They see a country where they are still not fully free or safe and one in which they still don\u2019t feel like they fully belong.\u201d", "description": "Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has released a set of proposals outlining his LGBT agenda, a bid to own the issue when many LGBT priorities have become Democratic orthodoxy.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570657814/191009-Bixby-Buttigieg-tease_afssdo", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
