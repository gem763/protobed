Frank Baum\u2019s Oz series\u2014popularized a more positive representation of them as a symbol of female autonomy. Princesses have also been reinvented in a similar way. Gail Carson Levine\u2019s retelling of Cinderella in the young-adult novel Ella Enchanted, for instance, represented a new kind of princess whose value wasn\u2019t dependent on physical beauty.\n\n\u200bEvery Friday in the Books Briefing, we thread together Atlantic stories on books that share similar ideas.

There has to be a Frankenstein/Dracula equivalent of a werewolf story out there somewhere, right?\u201d\n\nWerewolves certainly have a long history in literature. You may want to try one of the earliest major werewolf novels in English: George W. M. Reynolds\u2019s Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf, a gothic tale about a man making a deal with the devil that was first serialized in 1846 and is available online in full. The philosopher John Fiske wrote about these mythical creatures for The Atlantic a few decades later, in 1871.\n\nAlthough the main character in Hermann Hesse\u2019s 1927 classic, Steppenwolf, doesn\u2019t literally transform into a wolf, the story\u2019s symbolism is believed to have inspired many werewolf novels. Some of the short stories in Angela Carter\u2019s 1979 collection, The Bloody Chamber, use werewolf narratives to explore sexual and gender politics. And Glen Duncan\u2019s 2011 novel, The Last Werewolf, which contains a lot of graphic violence, is elevated by the werewolf protagonist\u2019s playful prose and poignant existential questions.", "description": "Witches and werewolves and clowns, oh my!
