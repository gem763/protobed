Stifled by US sanctions, Tehran is committed to maintaining its six billion euro ($6.6 billion) annual exports to Iraq.\n\nLikewise Washington needs Iraq to contain the danger of a resurgent Islamic State group, and to keep Iran's regional influence in check.\n\n- 'Pandora's box' -\n\nThe danger now, Fantappie said, is that some in the US administration interpret anti-Iran slogans by protesters as evidence of mounting anti-Iranian sentiment overall.\n\nUS officials who see Abdel Mahdi as indecisive and powerless may even push to replace him in light of the demonstrations, she said.\n\nBut this \"could be like opening a Pandora's box, given a stagnating political system, mounting popular frustrations and the perennial difficulty of forming a government\" in a country caught between rival powers.\n\nThe shifts in Iraq's political arena go beyond the pro-US and pro-Iran camps -- other factions have also made moves since the start of the month.\n\nFirebrand Sadr maintains the ability to paralyse the country with sit-ins -- as he has done in the past.\n\nGrand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, Iraq's highest Shiite spiritual leader, said in his sermon Friday that he \"had no interest in any party in power\" and only defended \"the interests of the people\".\n\nEven as calm appears to have returned to Iraq, the protests may yet be rekindled, particularly if public anger grows as videos showing last week's crackdown continue to circulate online.", "description": "Iraq's deadliest wave of protests since the 2003 ouster of dictator Saddam Hussein has made the country vulnerable to a battle for influence between its two main competing allies, the United States and Iran, analysts say.
