But make no mistake: The unicorn\u2019s free-spending days are over. Its savior is far from a bottomless pit of money.\n\nWhile WeWork had an eye-watering $22 billion of debt at the end of June plus $47 billion of looming lease-payment obligations, its rescuer isn\u2019t in such great shape either. SoftBank is a junk-rated issuer, with the equivalent of $62 billion in net debt. From now on, founder Masayoshi Son will have to manage his cash pile carefully.\n\nThe Japanese company has done an excellent job of reinventing itself. Last December, S&P Global Ratings removed its negative outlook after SoftBank listed its domestic telecom unit. Moody\u2019s Investors Service, meanwhile, relabeled the company as an investment firm. That means investors have started to evaluate SoftBank\u2019s debt by comparing it to the market value of its investments, rather than to the company\u2019s cash flow.\n\nAgainst the 26.6 trillion yen ($245 billion) value of its portfolio, SoftBank\u2019s 6.7 trillion of net debt looks comfortable. Much of that is attributable to a 26% stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., now worth about $116 billion. Last month, Moody\u2019s shrugged off the resignation of Adam Neumann as WeWork\u2019s CEO, noting that even a 50% devaluation of We Co. would only be about 1% of SoftBank\u2019s investment portfolio. Likewise, SoftBank would be able to absorb potential writedowns of as much as $7 billion at the Vision Fund because of the value of its Alibaba stake.\n\nThe WeWork rescue package is changing the game, though. In a statement last week, Moody\u2019s adopted a stronger tone and drew the spotlight back to SoftBank\u2019s cash management. The agency would consider a downward rating action if cash held at the conglomerate could no longer cover two years of debt maturities, it warned.\n\nSo far, this has been a breeze for SoftBank. As of the June quarter, the company held 1.2 trillion yen of cash, comfortably more than the 550 billion yen of debt maturing over the next two years.\n\nIt\u2019s going to get tighter. SoftBank\u2019s cash rose to about 2.5 trillion yen as of July, thanks to a tax refund and the sale of shares in Chinese ride-hailing unicorn DiDi Chuxing Inc. to the Vision Fund. Against that, SoftBank has to fund a WeWork bailout costing the equivalent of about 1 trillion yen and pay 1.3 trillion yen of debt coming due in the 2021 fiscal year. Son has also made $54 billion of pledges to four investment funds, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephen Flynn estimates.\n\nLike WeWork, SoftBank is anything but a cash cow. Subsidiaries from U.S. telecom provider Sprint Corp. to British chipmaker ARM Holdings Inc. don\u2019t generate much. As a result, SoftBank has to live off what\u2019s on hand, proceeds from new bond sales, or dividends from its 66.5%-owned Japanese telecom business. In a pinch, the company could always sell investments to the Vision Fund, though the slide in shares of key holdings such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Slack Technologies Inc. has reduced the appeal of such disposals. Frustratingly, SoftBank\u2019s shares in Alibaba aren\u2019t publicly traded and the highly profitable Chinese e-commerce company doesn\u2019t pay a dividend.\n\nIt could be argued that SoftBank got WeWork at a distressed price and that once the shared-office startup\u2019s liquidity crisis has passed, its valuation will rebound from the bailout tag of less than $8 billion. Don\u2019t bet on it. If WeWork needs further significant financial support, the savior may struggle to provide it.\n\nSoftBank, meanwhile, looks likely to keep its bankers busy with plenty of refinancing work in the years ahead.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Shuli Ren at sren38@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Matthew Brooker at mbrooker1@bloomberg.net\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nShuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Asian markets.
