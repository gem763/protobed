The study, published Thursday, looked at the top 30 Netflix markets based on how many subscribers they have and how many Netflix originals are produced there.\n\nThe UK leads as Netflix's biggest international territory with 11.5 million subscribers and 78 productions. The streaming giant has built up an impressive library of British shows and snatched up the streaming rights to multiple UK productions, such as \"Bodyguard\" and \"The Last Kingdom.\"\n\nBut Australia, Poland, Germany, and the Netherlands have the most potential for growth, according to Ampere.\n\nAmpere's report said that these four territories \"display the characteristics of underweight markets\" and that the \"size of the streaming audience in Australia makes it an ideal target for local investment.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 8 great Netflix original TV series that show how well its British strategy is working\n\nAustralia has 4.5 million Netflix subscribers, but just 12 productions, according to Ampere. Germany has over 8 million subscribers and 23 productions; nearly 3 million subscribers and three productions are in the Netherlands; and 1 million subscribers and 1 production are in Poland.\n\n\"Although existing demand is met with English-language originals, productions with a home-baked Australian flavour will pay dividends in a market with strong SVoD penetration, especially in the light of Disney's D2C imminent launch here,\" Ampere said of Australia in the report.\n\nREAD MORE: TV networks are mirroring Netflix by ordering fewer pilots, and there are 2 major reasons\n\nDisney announced last month that it will launch its upcoming streaming platform, Disney Plus, in Australia (as well as New Zealand) on November 19. It launches in the Netherlands (as well as Canada) on November 12, the same day as its US launch.\n\nSwitzerland, Finland, and Portugal have no local Netflix productions, and Ampere said they are \"smaller markets worthy of joining Belgium\" in getting one. Netflix's \"Narcos\" producer is developing the first Belgian original, \"Into the Night.\"", "description": "Australia is one of the most important markets for Netflix with the biggest potential for growth, according to a new Ampere Analysis report.", "authors": ["Travis Clark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d713c442e22af623e2267cb-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
