The deal would see United Technologies' aerospace business combined with Raytheon and is expected to close in the first half of next year.\n\nRoku \u2014 Roku shares jumped 4.2% on news that Citadel Securities took a 5% stake in the media-streaming device maker. The stock also got a boost after an analyst at RBC Capital Markets upgraded it to outperform from market perform. The analyst cited a \"compelling\" valuation and strong revenue growth among the reasons for the upgrade.\n\nWendy's \u2014 Shares of the fast-food chain gained 3.8% after Wendy's gave more details about its plans to launch nationwide breakfast and expand in Europe. The company said it will invest about $20 million to support U.S. stores in preparation of the 2020 breakfast rollout. Wendy's also expects breakfast to become at least 10% of its daily sales.\n\nJohnson & Johnson \u2014 Shares of the pharmaceutical giant gained 1.8% after Bernstein upgraded the company to an outperform rating. The firm said the stock is now at a \"historically cheap\" valuation, and that they expect the company's ongoing lawsuits to be resolved over the next 6 - 12 months.\n\nCrowdstrike \u2014 The cyber security company's stock fell 3.2% following a downgrade to sell at Goldman Sachs.

SAP also pre-announced third-quarter results, which beat expectations in part due to a cloud customer.\n\nFastenal \u2013 Shares of Fastenal skyrocketed more than 16% after the maker of construction and industrial supplies reported stronger-than-expected earnings. Fastenal earned 37 cents per share in the past quarter, 2 cents above estimates, while revenue also came slightly above Wall Street forecasts.
