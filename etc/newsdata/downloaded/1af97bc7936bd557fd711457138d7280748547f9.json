Over the past year or so, Dell has taken premium features that come standard in XPS machines and translated them for the Inspiron line. The company knows it can't rely on the XPS family alone to draw in customers that care about how their laptops look and feel\u2014it needs more machines that feel as versatile as those XPSes.\n\nThe improved Inspiron line will offer a lot to these users: aluminum designs, 8th-gen Intel processors, 4K touchscreen support, optional Optane memory, inking abilities, and more. The new Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 Black Edition comes as close as the line gets to an XPS, but it has a convenient twist. In addition to all of the features previously listed, the new design includes a top-mounted webcam along with a magnetic pen garage built into the hinge. While it can get expensive even for an Inspiron, it has a lot of things that are omitted in the XPS family\u2014things some users will definitely want in their primary laptops.\n\nLook and feel\n\nSpecs at a glance: Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Black Edition (as reviewed) Screen 13.3-inch 4K (3840 x 2160) IPS touchscreen OS Windows 10 CPU Intel Core i7-8565U RAM 16GB LPDDR3 HDD 512GB PCIe SSD (32GB\n\nOptane memory H10) GPU Intel UHD Graphics 620 Networking 802.11ac 2x2 WiFi, Bluetooth Ports 1 x USB-C 3.1 Gen 1, 1 x USB-A, 1 x HDMI port, 1 x microSD card, 1 x headphone/mic jack, 1 x power port Size 12.7\u00d78.8\u00d7 0.7 inches Weight 3.8 pounds Battery 52Whr 4C Starting price $1,322.99 Price as reviewed $1,420.99\n\nDell Inspiron 13 7000 Black Edition Buy Now (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)\n\nThe Inspiron line contains the 3000, 5000, and 7000 families , and the latter is the most luxurious of them all. The new 13-inch Black Edition looks and feels just premium enough to justify its higher price tag, which starts above $1,000. If the XPS 13 lost its metallic accents and swelled up just a bit, as if it was stung by a bee, you'd have the Inspiron 13 7000 Black Edition. Measuring 12.7 x 8.8 x 0.7-inches and weighing 3.8 pounds, it feels more substantial in your hands but it's not heavy by any means.\n\nIt's also noticeably larger when placed side-by-side to the XPS 13, and it's thicker where the lid meets the chassis thanks to the new pen garage. In addition to being home to an active pen, the extra thickness at the back edge allowed Dell to include one full-sized HDMI port and a USB-A port (both of which the XPS lacks), in addition to one USB-C port, one microSD card slot, one headphone jack, and one power port on the machine's side edges.\n\nGone are the days when laptops were made chunky enough to fit a slew of connectivity options (the major exception being gaming laptops)\u2014companies are trying to include as many ports as possible in these more affordable laptop families without adding extra heft. The Inspiron 13 7000 Black Edition may be about 0.3 inches thicker than the XPS 13 and nearly one pound heavier, but those are small sacrifices to make when you're getting a machine that's arguably just as elegant\u2014just in a different way.\n\nI'm not the type of person who cares what other people think about my tech, but it is a factor for some people. That's why Dell, and most other PC OEMs, make premium lines that basically all put their own spin on a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro design. If you want those metallic finishes and fiber-glass palm rests, you're going to go for the XPS regardless of its limitations. But the Black Edition is almost as sleek and certainly as professional looking as the XPS 13, making it a machine that you won't mind working with in public.\n\nWhile the regular Inspiron 13 2-in-1s have FHD and 4K display options, the Black Edition only comes with a 4K touchscreen. That's most likely because it's a special version of the Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 (which starts at $832.99), and it also comes standard with an active pen\u2014a tool geared towards artists and others who place more value on a higher-quality display. The bezels surrounding the 13.3-inch screen aren't as thin as those on the XPS, but they don't take away from the stellar viewing experience that the screen has. The additional space on the top bezel allowed Dell to include an HD webcam.\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nValentina Palladino\n\nKeyboard, trackpad, and active pen\n\nThe keyboard layout is also similar to that of the XPS 13, but Dell moved the fingerprint reader and power button combo right above the Backspace key. Unlike the embedded circular button on the XPS 13, the Black Edition's power button has a dedicated keycap that you press to turn the device on and off, and that lets you log in with your fingerprint. There isn't a one-press power and sign on option, but otherwise the fingerprint reader works as designed. As a result of moving the power button to the left a bit, the top row of function keys are all slightly smaller and more square-shaped than those on the XPS 13.\n\nThe Precision trackpad looks and feels nearly identical to that on the XPS 13. It's still a little small for my liking (I'm used to an expansive trackpad like that on the MacBook Pro), but it works as you'd expect it to.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to love 2-in-1s, but those that love them for their versatility as digital notebooks will appreciate the Black Edition. Dell includes an active pen with every Inspiron 13 7000 Black Edition as it lives in a pen-shaped garage in the machine's hinge. Not only does it magnetically stick to that garage, but it will stay in place regardless of which position the 2-in-1 is in.\n\nThis is one of the more elegant solutions to the active pen problem I've seen on a laptop. Some devices, like Acer's Spin 3, have tiny scribblers that hide inside their chassis, and others simply have magnetic edges that the pen is supposed to stick to. I prefer the former solution to the latter, but those pens tend to be smaller and less adept as actual writing tools. Dell's active pen, powered by a AAAA battery, mimics a real pen in its size, has two side buttons, and has a concave top portion (where the eraser would be) that makes it easier to remove from its garage.\n\nIt also helps that it's a smooth writing and drawing tool. I saw very little latency when taking notes and sketching on the Black Edition's screen. It's one of the better active pens I've used, not only because of its low latency, but because it feels so similar to a real pen, pencil, or marker. I would have loved for it to have a rechargeable battery, like the active pens that are optional with the newest HP convertibles, but the AAAA solution is still standard.", "description": "Dell gives this Inspiron 2-in-1 a glow-up without sacrificing power or features.", "authors": ["Valentina Palladino"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/inspiron137000BE_4-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-06"}
