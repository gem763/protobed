Allahu Akbar! \u201d from cheering locals. The thick accents of the supporters made it clear however that the video was not shot in Tal Abyad, but rather in the adjacent Turkish town of Ak\u00e7akale across the border.\n\nAfter three days of anticipation and a sense in Turkey that it finally would overcome its inability to deal with the Kurdish canton to its south, by early Thursday morning Ankara\u2019s plans to attack the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) statelet in Syria appeared frustrated yet again. Then, a s The Daily Beast went to press late Thursday morning the joint Turkish-FSA ground assault on the area surrounding Tal Abyad was underway, according to numerous sources on both the Turkish and SDF side.\n\nMilitary and media sources from both the SDF and Turkish side confirmed that a joint Turkish-FSA ground assault aimed at cutting off the key border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain. By late afternoon, Turkish and FSA forces had taken over a string of villages on the both the eastern and western flanks of Tal Abyad, including Tal Findr, al-Yabsa, Tal Akhdar, B\u2019ir Ashaq and Qsas, in preparation to eventually surround and besiege the city, one of the most important commercial border crossings in northern Syria.\n\nA local witness to the clashes who fled his hometown in the area acknowledged that some schools and civilian facilities were targeted during the strike, \u201chowever this was due to the presence of SDF fighters who took refuge in some of these facilities as cover against the Turkish armed forces\u201d, he said.\n\nIn many areas where previous clashes had taken place, such as the border crossings at al-Malikia and Darbasia, locals reported a sharp reduction in SDF troop presence than the previous day. Other reports suggested that, despite these development, a new wave of US troops withdrew from Syria into Iraq, leaving the SDF to fend off the Turkish assault on their own.\n\nInternational and U.S. congressional opposition to the Turkish assault was largely to thank for stalling of the offensive, at least temporarily, as it reined in the free hand Turkey thought it would enjoy in northern Syria. President Erdogan was forced to think twice about a full-on invasion. Early condemnation of the assault from European countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and others undoubtedly sent a shock through Turkey\u2019s leadership, which relies on the European Union as its biggest source of imports, exports and foreign direct investment.\n\n\u201c Keep in mind, we got a green light from Trump to carry out this invasion. \u201d \u2014 Mustafa al-Sayjeri, chairman of the political office of Liwa al-Mu\u2019atasim\n\nFinland, just three weeks after approving the export of drones to Turkey, went so far as to announce it would cease all arms shipments to Ankara as part of a commitment to support a joint EU condemnation of Turkey\u2019s assault on the area.\n\nTurkey, well into a years long recession, with a depreciating currency, cannot afford similar measures from other European nations.\n\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and normally an ardent supporter Donald Trump, has clashed repeatedly with the president over his eagerness to withdraw from Syria. Graham appeared alongside Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen on Wednesday to announce a bi-partisan plan to impose new sanctions against Turkey should it\u2019s assault on the SDF continue.\n\nThe confusion sowed by President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops and the divisions created within the U.S. establishment and America\u2019s own allies appears to have trickled down to the Syrian battlefield, leaving local commanders on the ground torn.\n\n\u201cThe position of European governments and the U.S. Congress is unfortunate, however to be expected, as they\u2019ve always opposed our position towards the PKK,\u201d said Mustafa al-Sayjeri, chairman of the political office of Liwa al-Mu\u2019atasim, one of the largest FSA factions taking part in the campaign and closely allied to Ankara. Turkey and its allies make essentially no distinction between the banned Kurdish insurgents in Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) and the Kurdish elements that dominate the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\n\u201cHowever keep in mind, we got a green light from Trump to carry out this invasion,\u201d said al-Sayjeri. \u201cBoth Turkey and the FSA respect U.S. troops serving on the ground, and our goal is not to engage or clash with them at all.\u201d\n\nAl-Sayjeri himself has worked previously with the United States as a member of various FSA groups that received U.S. funding to combat the so-called Islamic State from 2014 to 2016.\n\nAs the Turkish assault got underway late Thursday evening, Turkish President Erdogan himself grew more defiant in the face of international pressure, saying to a gathering of Turkey\u2019s Parliament in Ankara, \u201cif you [oppose] our campaign, our response is simple: we\u2019ll release 3.6m Syrian refugees [across our borders into Europe]\u201d, to widespread applause in parliament.\n\nDespite the efforts of the international community and the U.S. Congress to restrain Turkey, deep bitterness remained among the embattled Kurdish commanders, many of whom were frankly bewildered after years fighting and dying on the ground with U.S. support in the battles against ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t speak to American traitors,\u201d said one high-ranking SDF commander when approached by The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have nothing to say.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma faced by the United States in attempting to appease both the Kurdish dominated SDF and Turkey, along with its FSA allies such as al-Sayjeri, has proven to be an impossible balancing act inevitably doomed to collapse.\n\n\"The SDF was always a short-term expedient that always would have a longer term cost, sooner or later,\" according to Robert Ford, the former U.S. ambassador to Syria who initially helped coordinate the State Department's liaison with Syrian rebel groups. \"Later is here and the bill is coming due.\"\n\nAlthough American forces didn\u2019t provide assistance to the SDF fending off Turkish aerial bombardment, U.S. troops did take steps to ward off pro-Assad forces advancing farther southwest near the city of Manbij, an SDF enclave west of the Euphrates that has been a source of U.S.-Turkish negotiations for nearly a year and a half.\n\nOn the eve of the assault, rumors swirled that Russian forces were preparing to launch an assault on the city of Tabqa near Manbij and the southernmost SDF controlled region. According to activists, the mobilization was real, and took place on the outskirts of the Manbij countryside:\n\n\u201cRegime forces sent reinforcements and mobilized along the borders of Manbij, however didn\u2019t make any effort to enter SDF territory,\u201d claimed Abd al-Karim Abd al-Saleh, a member of the pro-Syrian opposition Manbij Revolutionary Council (MRC) in exile. \u201cAs usual, they relied on Iranian backed militias, in this case the al-Baqir Brigades,\u201d he said referring to a tribal militia from eastern Deir Ezzor province known for having converted en masse from Sunni to Shi\u2019a Islam.\n\n\u201c The Syrian regime and some Russian forces already maintain a presence in a string of villages. \u201d\n\nSocial media accounts and local activists claimed U.S. troops still in the area carried out patrols along the demarcation line between the SDF and regime territory to ward off the advance.\n\nThe Syrian regime and some Russian forces already maintain a presence in a string of villages in the far west extremities of the Manbij pocket, while pro-regime political and tribal figures have long operated openly in the area under SDF protection. The regime has long eyed Manbij as one of the first territories it would seek to annex in the event of an SDF collapse.\n\nDespite the SDF\u2019s ability to hold off both Turkish and Assad forces for one day, as the SDF sent reinforcements to the border , ISIS members managed to take advantage of the vacuum in Raqqa city, the former Islamic State capital, and elsewhere to launch brazen attacks and orchestrate a prison break.\n\nThe latter development appears to have pushed the Trump administration to transfer custody of two high profile ISIS foreign fighters out of the country in order to avoid their potential escape.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, an SDF spokesman claimed that 50 ISIS fighters besieged and attempted to take over a security headquarters in Raqqa city in what some interpreted as the group's first attempt to re-assert territorial control since it's \u201cfinal\u201d defeat at the town of Baghuz. The assault included anywhere from three to six suicide bombings. Local sources interviewed by The Daily Beast claimed the clashes lasted more than an hour. Elsewhere, deep in the desert in territory controlled by the regime, ISIS reportedly killed 17 people belonging to a pro-Assad militia.\n\n\u201c SDF forces clashed with ISIS cells in the countryside south of Tal Rifa\u2019at for nearly two hours Thursday morning in the leadup to the Turkish assault. \u201d\n\nMustafa Bali, an SDF Spokesman, told The Daily Beast that SDF forces also clashed with ISIS cells in the countryside south of Tal Rifa\u2019at for nearly two hours Thursday morning in the leadup to the Turkish assault. \u201cThe situation in Raqqa was already very dangerous, as the number of ISIS fighters that attacked al-Basel was very large,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clashes this morning also don\u2019t bode well, especially near Ras al-Ain.\u201d\n\nThe status of prisons where ISIS prisoners were held created the most cause for concern. Wednesday evening, reports surfaced that ISIS women being held at the al-Hol facility in Hasakah province managed to burn down their own tents to facilitate an escape.\n\nAccording to Bali, the situation is under control, but his statements remained vague, \u201cthe situation at al-Hol has been very tense and dangerous, however we were able to secure to situation, at the camp.\u201d As early as Oct. 5, 2019, videos of female ISIS members violently clashing with guards circulated on social media.\n\nBali added that during the Turkish assault, planes allegedly struck another facility known as al-Chirkin holding high value ISIS suspects. It\u2019s unclear as of yet whether or not fighters at the second facility were able to escape, or even the extent of the damage at the facility.\n\nSuch developments reinforce the delicate nature of the situation and the potential for a renewed outbreak of terror activity in the event of a protracted conflict involving Turkey, the SDF, the Assad regime and it\u2019s allies, a fact the SDF has made sure to play up and emphasize in it\u2019s messaging.\n\nFuture prospects for the campaign suggest that the joint Turkish-FSA force will likely seek to extend as far as Ain Aissa, the deepest into SDF territory the former have struck throughout the campaign. As early as Wednesday, several Turkish air assaults destroyed facilities near the town of Ain Aissa, including the al-Rami oil field near the town of al-Hawashan in addition to the site of a now abandoned US military base that also served as an SDF intelligence center, killing 7 and wounding 16. Since then, attacks have continued, with Turkish airforce striking the 93rd Brigade military base south of the city.\n\nIn recent days, debate over the extent and depth of the planned Turkish assault has continued, mostly due to questions over Turkey\u2019s own capacity to occupy and administer territory deep into the Syrian interior in light of the difficulty it\u2019s already faced doing so in other territories in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Ain Aissa, located 45 kilometers south of the Turkish border, is located deeper in Syrian territory than the agreed upon depth of any safe zone previously discussed by the US and Turkey, which US negotiators hoped would not exceed 30 kilometers.\n\nSome Turkish and FSA sources have claimed they will also soon seek to incorporate Manbij into their area of operations, however with the exception of a few brief skirmishes with SDF forces in that area, this are has yet to see the same level of Turkish penetration. However the attacks on Ain Aissa give a preliminary sense as to how far the Turkish military intends to go.\n\nMichael Weiss also contributed to this report.", "description": "The ground invasion was held up overnight, but recommenced on Thursday morning.
