Also on Monday, the director of the National Weather Service broke with NOAA leadership over its handling of Trump\u2019s Dorian tweets and statements.\n\nIn an email to NOAA staff that was obtained by The Washington Post, NOAA\u2019s Craig McLean, called the agency\u2019s response \u201cpolitical\u201d and a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s incorrect assertion on Sept. 1 that Alabama \u201cwould most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated\u201d set off a chain of confusion and outrage among the public and within NOAA. At the time, the NWS\u2019s forecast guidance showed only a very small risk (about 5 percent) of tropical-storm-force winds for a small portion of Alabama. However, Alabama was not in the storm forecast track or \u201ccone of uncertainty\u201d from the National Hurricane Center, which showed Hurricane Dorian skirting the East Coast far away from Alabama.\n\nWhile the NWS\u2019s Birmingham office set the record straight, stating Alabama \u201cwould NOT see any impacts\u201d from the storm, NOAA officials caused an internal uproar on Sept. 6 when the agency issued an unsigned statement that defended Trump\u2019s false claim about Alabama and admonished the Weather Service\u2019s Birmingham division for speaking \u201cin absolute terms.\u201d Acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs and NOAA communications director Julie Kay Roberts were involved in drafting Friday\u2019s statement.\n\n[NOAA backs Trump on Alabama hurricane forecast, rebukes Weather Service for accurately contradicting him]\n\nNOAA and NWS had also appeared to try to correct the record without angering the president. According to emails obtained by The Post, before the statement on Friday, NOAA staff were instructed to \u201conly stick with official National Hurricane Center forecasts if questions arise from some national level social media posts which hit the news this afternoon\u201d and not to \u201cprovide any opinion\u201d in response to Trump\u2019s initial Alabama tweets.\n\nThe agency sent a similar message warning scientists and meteorologists not to speak out on Sept. 4, after Trump showed a hurricane map from Aug. 29 modified with a hand-drawn half-circle in black Sharpie around Alabama.\n\nScientists attacked NOAA officials for conceding to Trump during a weather emergency, when accuracy and messaging are vital to keep the public safe.\n\nThe American Meteorological Society issued a statement of support for the NWS, writing: \u201cAMS believes the criticism of the Birmingham forecast office is unwarranted; rather they should have been commended for their quick action based on science in clearly communicating the lack of threat to the citizens of Alabama.\"\n\n[NOAA\u2019s support of Trump over its own scientists provokes uproar in weather community]\n\nIn his email to employees Sunday, McLean criticized his agency\u2019s public statement, saying it prioritized politics over NOAA\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cThe NWS Forecaster(s) corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way, as they should,\u201d McLean wrote. \u201cThere followed, last Friday, an unsigned news release from 'NOAA\u2019 that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster. My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political.\u201d\n\nHe also wrote that \u201cthe content of this news release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.\"\n\n\u201cIf the public cannot trust our information, or we debase our forecaster\u2019s warnings and products, that specific danger arises,\u201d McLean wrote.\n\nAs a result, McLean told his staff that \u201cI am pursuing the potential violations of our NOAA Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity.\"\n\n\u201cI have a responsibility to pursue these truths,\u201d he added. \u201cI will.\u201d McLean has extensive experience in NOAA\u2019s ocean programs and is also an attorney who has practiced marine resource law. He has been awarded the Department of Commerce Silver and Bronze medals, among other accolades.\n\nWhen asked about the McLean email, an NWS spokesperson stressed the agency is committed to promoting and maintaining scientific integrity. \u201cThe NWS leadership team stands with the entire National Weather Service workforce and will continue to uphold the scientific integrity of the forecast process as it was skillfully applied by all NWS offices last week to ensure public safety, first and foremost,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nIn response to McLean\u2019s email, NOAA spokesman Scott Smullen stated: \u201cNOAA\u2019s policies on scientific integrity and communications are among the strongest in the federal government, and get high marks from third party observers. The agency\u2019s senior career leaders are free to express their opinions about matters of agency operations and science. The agency will not be providing further official comment, and will not speculate on internal reviews.\u201d\n\nNWS director backs agency forecasters\n\nAlso on Monday, National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini got a standing ovation at a major weather industry conference in Huntsville, Ala., when he broke with his bosses at NOAA by enthusiastically backing his agency\u2019s forecasters regarding their performance during Hurricane Dorian.\n\nUccellini, who has been part of NWS since 1989, praised Birmingham\u2019s NWS office for clarifying that there was no threat to the region and upholding \u201cthe integrity of the forecasting process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did what any office would do,\u201d Uccellini told the crowd of hundreds of meteorologists. \u201cWith an emphasis they deemed essential, they shut down what they thought were rumors. They quickly acted to reassure their partners, the media and the public \u2014 with strong language \u2014 that there was no threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did that with one thing in mind: public safety,\u201d Uccellini said. \u201cAnd they responded not knowing where this information was coming from. Only later, [when] the retweets and the politically based comments came into their office, did they learn the source of this information.\u201d\n\nWow! What a powerful moment and moving show of support with a standing ovation for WFO Birmingham. Thank you @NWSDirector! #NWAS19 pic.twitter.com/PDXz0TrZOa \u2014 Rick Smith (@ounwcm) September 9, 2019\n\nUccellini noted the strong relationships the Birmingham office has with local emergency officials, particularly in the wake of tornadoes that killed 23 in the region in March. He said these emergency officials praised the Birmingham weather team\u2019s speed in quashing the false information.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: The Birmingham office did this to stop public panic,\u201d he said, and \u201cto ensure public safety.\u201d\n\n.@NWSDirector offers a very impassioned defense of the @NWSBirmingham, stating they did exactly what they were supposed to do. The office received a standing ovation. So did Louis. The word \u201cintegrity\u201d was used a lot. Kudos to him. #nwas19 \u2014 Matt Lanza (@mattlanza) September 9, 2019\n\nHe then called for members of the Birmingham NWS office to stand, along with all NWS employees. Attendees gave them a loud, minute-long standing ovation, and also gave Uccellini a standing ovation.\n\nNOAA\u2019s Jacobs, who has a science background in computer modeling and has sought to improve NWS forecast models, is slated to address the same Alabama audience on Tuesday morning, and there is social media chatter of planned protests of his speech.\n\nThe backstory\n\nAt stake is public trust in weather forecasts and warnings aimed at saving lives and protecting property, as many current and former NOAA leaders and meteorologists have expressed fear that this controversy has damaged NWS\u2019s credibility by politicizing weather forecasts\n\nThe unsigned statement NOAA released late Friday justified Trump\u2019s tweets and statements throughout the past week on Hurricane Dorian\u2019s threat to Alabama by noting that the possibility of tropical-storm-force winds meant that Alabama could be affected.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet that Alabama would be affected by the storm gained national attention last Wednesday when he presented the version of the forecast cone from Aug. 29, extended into Alabama \u2014 modified using a Sharpie. The crudely altered map appeared to represent an effort to retroactively justify the original Alabama tweet.\n\nIn the face of criticism about the modified map, Trump fired off additional tweets Wednesday and Thursday, insisting Alabama was at risk all along, including presenting a map from Aug. 29 depicting a small possibility that Alabama would see tropical-storm-force winds.\n\nBut, on Sunday morning, Sept. 1, when Trump tweeted about the Alabama threat, no credible computer model showed any serious risk to the state.\n\nColby Itkowitz contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump\u2019s insistence that his incorrect Alabama tweet was correct tips into the Orwellian", "description": "A top NOAA official said he would investigate if NOAA violated its scientific integrity policy, while at the same time the director of the National Weather Service broke with NOAA leadership over its support of President Trump's Alabama tweets and statements.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/v9RF0yMlhKRZay_f76JXZ7poR5U=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5Q3M4KGRDII6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
