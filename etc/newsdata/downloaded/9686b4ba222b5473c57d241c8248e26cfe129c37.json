Holes investigates each case and lends his expertise to local law enforcement actively searching for answers.\n\n\u201c[This] is a show that I helped create,\u201d Holes told Fox News. \u201cI worked with the production company and the Oxygen network in order to come up with this concept. And what\u2019s exciting about it is during the course of my career, I was a cold case investigator and that\u2019s my passion.\u201d\n\nGOLDEN STATE KILLER INVESTIGATOR TALKS SUSPECT\u2019S STRANGE BEHAVIOR, LAUNCHING TRUE CRIME PODCAST \u2018MURDER SQUAD\u2019\n\n\u201cI like going after these unsolved cases,\u201d he continued. \"In essence, I am doing ... what I did when I was active in investigating cold cases. And so the viewers are going to see sort of an inside track on how an investigation is conducted.\u201d\n\nHoles is famously known for his involvement with the arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer, who had eluded capture for decades.\n\nMARY STAUFFER\u2019S HORRIFIC 1980 KIDNAPPING INSPIRES NEW FILM 'ABDUCTED': 'AFTER TRAGEDY THERE IS HOPE'\n\nJoseph DeAngelo, 73, was taken into custody last year based on DNA evidence linking him to at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes across California in the 1970s and \u201880s. He\u2019s awaiting trial on 26 charges in a Sacramento jail and has not entered a plea.\n\nHoles, who was working on the case at the time, said DNA profiling techniques helped lead to an arrest. The Golden State Killer went undetected for years as he broke into his victims' homes to rape and murder them. It is believed his final victim was killed in 1986.\n\nHoles started his search for the killer as a police academy graduate and forensic toxicologist in Contra Costa when he was in his 20s, according to The Sacramento Bee. The Golden State Killer case became a career-long obsession.\n\nFLORIDA MAN'S FORMER ESCORT WIFE TRIED HIRING A HIT MAN: 'I WAS PRAYING IT WASN'T HER'\n\nBut even with DeAngelo behind bars and Holes retired, the former lawman still has the urge to help grieving loved ones.\n\nTED BUNDY SURVIVORS RECALL SERIAL KILLER'S BRUTALITY ON 'DR. OZ': \u2018MOST OF MY BONES WERE BROKEN IN MY FACE\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2026 In the last 10 years of my career, I was working [the Golden State Killer case] every day,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd then once that case got solved and I was retired, I just ... felt a void. It\u2019s like, \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019 Well, this show is allowing me to step back into that investigative role of evaluating crime scenes, looking at what kinds of forensic testing can be done and to see if I can help law enforcement agencies across the nation solve some of the most difficult and horrific unsolved cases out there.\u201d\n\nAnd Holes insisted \u201cThe DNA of Murder\u201d could finally lead to answers.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely possible that cases can and will be solved during the course of \u2018The DNA of Murder,\u2019\u201d he insisted. \u201cMy goal is to advance every single case. I want the law enforcement agency and the victims\u2019 families to understand that when I have come into the case and I have assessed the case that they\u2019re better off than before. But there are cases that I am incredibly optimistic are solvable and that can be solved with the steps that I am taking\u2026\u201d\n\n'THE DEVIL YOU KNOW' EXPLORES SELF-PROCLAIMED SATANIST WHO SUFFERED 'SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES'\n\nThe first episode focuses on Rose Burkert, a 22-year-old nurse, and her married boyfriend, 32-year-old Roger Atkison. On Sept. 12, 1980, the pair checked into a Holiday Inn near Williamsburg, Iowa. After a last-minute cancellation, Atkison and Burkert were able to book a room at the hotel where a mortician\u2019s convention was being held. However, Atkison and Burkert were found dead in their rooms.\n\n\u2018HOMICIDE HUNTER\u2019 STAR LT. JOE KENDA REVEALS THE ONE CASE THAT HAUNTS HIM THE MOST\n\nAccording to News Press Now, investigators described the scene as \u201coverkill.\u201d Several head wounds on both Burkert and Atkison indicated they were killed by a hatchet. There was no sign of forced entry and chairs were arranged near the bed as if the killer had carried on a conversation with the victims.\n\nFor the episode, Holes met with Burkert's best friend, as well as Atkison\u2019s brother and widow.\n\n\u201cAnytime I sit down and I talk to the victim\u2019s families, it\u2019s always hard,\u201d Holes admitted. \u201cEven in a case like Roger and Rose\u2019s, which occurred all the way back in 1980, to this day, these families, they\u2019ve suffered not only a horrible loss of this loved one, but they\u2019ve been traumatized as a result of that loss, of that homicide. And they want answers. So, sitting down with them is absolutely necessary for me in order to establish a rapport and to get to understand who the victims were. But also, my role is to comfort them.\u201d\n\nGEORGIA MAN WHO CONFESSED TO MURDERING BUSINESS PARTNER WAS DRIVEN BY GREED FROM POULTRY BUSINESS: DOC\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough balance to have, being an investigator, as well as somebody [who] is trying to say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m trying to make your life better. Get you the answers you\u2019re desperately seeking.' But seeing the pain on their faces and hearing the voice quiver as they talk about their loved one and the trauma that they suffered is emotional. [But] it\u2019s just part of the job.\u201d\n\n\u2018DEADLY WOMEN\u2019 HOST CANDICE DELONG SAYS FEW ARE \u2018BORN EVIL,\u2019 BELIEVES THERE ARE MORE UNDISCOVERED FEMALE KILLERS\n\nAnd when it comes to \u201cThe DNA of Murder,\u201d Holes said the response he\u2019s received from local law enforcement agencies has been positive.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement has been great,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd of course, I come out of law enforcement. I talk their language. Some agencies are, \u2018We got this. We\u2019re continuing to move forward with our case.\u2019 But then [there are] other agencies that have their arms wide open and say, \u2018Paul, please come in and take a look. See what you can see.\u2019 Whether it\u2019s just me having fresh eyes or I\u2019m coming in with a level of experience and expertise that the agency doesn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nHoles hopes \u201cThe DNA of Murder\u201d will give viewers a closer look at how investigations are conducted.\n\nWOMAN WHO KILLED \u2018DIRTY JOHN\u2019 SAYS SHE\u2019S STILL STRUGGLING WITH PTSD: \u2018I HAD TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENED TO ME\u2019\n\nRELATIVES OF SHARON TATE, JAY SEBRING SPEAK OUT ON HORRIFYING MANSON MURDERS 50 YEARS LATER\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies are allowing me to come in and take a look at their case files, their evidence, their forensic testing results,\u201d said Holes. \u201cI will [then] proceed with my investigation and then update law enforcement as to what I think is the most likely way that they will be able to solve their case. Additionally, I am talking to witnesses, I'm talking to the victims' families. The audiences are going to start to understand what happened to these victims, who these victims were [and] that these victims never should have died the way they died.\n\n\u201cSo there is an insight into the investigation, an insight into who the victims are, as well as what the story is about the crime and this act of investigation. So 'The DNA of Murder' is unique in many ways in that I am going in and working collaboratively with local law enforcement on their unsolved case.\u201d\n\n\"The DNA of Murder with Paul Holes\" premieres Oct. 12 at 8 p.m. on Oxygen.
