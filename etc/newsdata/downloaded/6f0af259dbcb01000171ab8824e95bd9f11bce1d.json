But what we cannot forget is that on her way to present the award, Gwyneth Paltrow moved across the stage with a walk so delicate it seemed like her body would fall apart if she moved any faster \u2014 just limbs in danger of dropping right the floor if she loosened her posture even the slightest bit.\n\nClearly we\u2019re dealing with a wardrobe issue here. Paltrow obviously did not select her dress with mobility in mind (unlike Viola Davis, who wore sneakers during her presenting bit). The combination of heels, a sleek skirt with apparently rigid fabric, the hand stuck clutching the garment so as to allow her feet room to move, and the long shawl that needed to stay in place all amounted to a kind of binding around the actress. The abbreviated steps, the motionless shoulders, the single swinging arm \u2014 it\u2019s like watching a cyborg in beta test make her awards-night debut. But of course, Paltrow maintained an unflinching smile during the entirety of the long walk, because a professional knows how to adapt. Let\u2019s take a look at that full video again and celebrate with the memes of the internet.\n\nthe goopery that this slow walk has pic.twitter.com/SwzNVnbLy6 \u2014 michael blackmon (@blackmon) September 23, 2019\n\nGwyneth awkwardly walking to the tune of Superstition is surreal and sending me \ud83d\udc80\n\npic.twitter.com/coakYPaokS \u2014 Ryan \ud83e\udd86 (@RyanstheMeek) September 23, 2019\n\nGoing from my bed to my fridge wrapped up in the comforter: pic.twitter.com/pFuGXwfMpF \u2014 Bedder (@itgetsbedder) September 23, 2019\n\nStay in touch.
