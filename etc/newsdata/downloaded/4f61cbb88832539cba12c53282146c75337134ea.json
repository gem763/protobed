Far be it for J.J. Abrams and the final trailer for his \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX \u2014 The Rise of Skywalker\u201d to lay all (or even most) of the cards on the table when it comes to the last film in the Skywalker Saga, but the latest look at the much-anticipated December release does provide a few tantalizing hints at what\u2019s to come. Other early looks at the feature have shown off new worlds, possible character twists, and the imminent battles to come, so what\u2019s left?\n\nThe last trailer unspools with a promise: \u201cThe Saga Will End.\u201d Along the way, old friends (and foes) return, new worlds will be ventured to, and it sure as hell looks like Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) will team up for at least one gobsmacking fight. For fans of Carrie Fisher, the indomitable Princess Leia returns to deepen her emotional bond with Rey, while fans of Mark Hamill will likely feel chills hearing his Luke Skywalker \u201cappear\u201d via voiceover. And he\u2019s hardly alone, as the trailer is filled with (literal) narrative tidbits from some of the franchise\u2019s signature characters \u2014 even a few that have yet to appear in the latest run of films.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nCheck out the full trailer right here, and if you\u2019re feeling particularly hungry for a deeper dive, check out seven big moments from the trailer below. Disney will release \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX \u2014 The Rise of Skywalker\u201d in theaters on December 20.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.
