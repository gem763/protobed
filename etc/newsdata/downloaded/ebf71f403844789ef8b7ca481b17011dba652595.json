It\u2019s a big move politically, but is she making a critical management mistake?\n\nIn her weekly press conference on Oct. 2, she wanted to discuss pressing policy priorities including infrastructure, health care and prescription drug prices. But the media remained largely focused on impeachment proceedings. Although Pelosi emphasized that no impeachment floor vote is being scheduled, the distraction now lingers over the party\u2019s other strategic goals.\n\nThis is not an ideological or political question. This is a case study for all managers on the use of that scarcest of all management resources: time.\n\nMARC THIESSEN: NOTHING WRONG WITH TRUMP ASKING FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO HELP INVESTIGATE MUELLER PROBE ORIGINS\n\nManagement is more than time management\n\nWhen anyone moves from the confines of being an individual contributor to the open air of management, they need a new perspective on time. All new managers struggle to move from the hands-on/efficiency of the staffer to the delegation/effectiveness of the manager. This transition is from the work of perfection \u2014 to produce a product without error \u2014 to the imprecise world of management, where the aim is advancing organizational goals.\n\nIf Pelosi's goal is to remove Trump, then a different result would prove she is wasting her time. She says she is moving forward in an urgent defense of the Constitution, up against the unyielding math of the Democrats\u2019 Senate minority. This is a common leadership error in which the \u201ctyranny of the urgent pushes out the important.\u201d\n\nNovice managers are often overwhelmed in the ambiguity, the shades of grey, the uncertainty of getting things done through other people. But Pelosi is an experienced, mature manager who should know better. Instead she makes the amateur's mistake: failing to slow down the impulses of \u201cstaff\u201d \u2014 or, in this case, the House Democrat Conference.\n\nJust say \u201cNo\u201d\n\nIn the late 1800s, Great Britain\u2019s Prime Minister William Gladstone said that a leader must be \u201ca good butcher;\u201d that he or she must cut out projects and initiatives. It is easy to say \u201cyes\u201d to constituents\u2019 demands and very good ideas to keep everyone happy. But the manager will run out of hours and weeks before well-meaning staffers run out of creeping missions. Time, talent and treasure are limited and must be reserved for what actually advances the organization\u2019s goals.\n\nImpeaching Trump is an appealing, immediate sugar-high for the Democrat majority in the House. But even Pelosi believes that House seats will be placed in jeopardy. And absolutely no other legislative campaign promises will be addressed in the time remaining before the 2020 election. So what other prize has her eyes?\n\nFocus\n\nThis is the challenge of management: What behaviors must my team complete to fulfill our vision? Disciplined leaders concentrate assets and ruthlessly ignore distractions. Will impeaching Trump in the House advance an agenda? Pass legislation? Remove a president?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFor the next year the speaker\u2019s energy \u2014 and nearly every Democratic member\u2019s \u2014 will be consumed with removing Trump. Instead of marshaling resources to get her House members reelected \u2014 or, even better, whipping votes to pass signature legislation \u2014 they are on a fool\u2019s errand, emotionally overwhelmed, chasing false gold. The professional manager controls passions and sets a course.\n\nPriorities\n\nSenior level C-Suite positions set the strategic direction for the organization. Recommendations from staffers should only be implemented if aligned with the corner office or the woman with the gavel. Pelosi has given control of her organization to members who are not concerned with her first duty to retain control of the House. This could prove to be a critical misstep.\n\nStrategic Management\n\nIn guiding an organization, a leader must look far into the future. Instead, Pelosi is peering into an abyss. She should take back control and make no further move on impeachment. But this is not likely. She has allowed herself to be carried away by events. She is not in command.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe House may get 218 votes to impeach. The Senate will not get 67 votes to convict. Over the next year the Democrats will not manage their time. Or the coming election.\n\nJack Yoest is an assistant professor of practice in leadership and management at the Catholic University of America in the Busch School of Business, in Washington, DC.
