I'm delighted he finished that opportunity.'\n\nHammers' fans wore Carlos Tevez masks to goad Sheffield United for their 2006-07 relegation\n\nDean Henderson had little to do before conceding from West Ham's first shot on target\n\nStand-in West Ham goalkeeper Roberto made some crucial saves for his side in the first half\n\nDeclan Rice put in a battling display but West Ham's forward three failed to take their chances\n\nAnd Wilder is keen to move on from the Tevez controversy that led to this match being billed as a grudge one.\n\nWilder said: 'It's a talking point but we want to make new memories for our supporters whether that's younger generation of supporters or supporters who have watched us through thin and thinner.'\n\nWest Ham's promising start to the season is fast becoming a distant memory.\n\nThey have now gone five games in all competitions without victory, a run that would have ended had they taken at least one of the presentable second half chances they created.\n\nPellergrini said: 'We are disappointed because we lost more points at home. It was similar to Crystal Palace. We created options [to win] but those options you must score.'\n\nAfter back-to-back defeats against Palace and Everton Pellegrini wielded the axe, making five changes.\n\nAs if that was not a clear enough indication that he meant business, he marched out of the tunnel with purpose, well before kick-off and the two teams to take his seat in the dugout.\n\nThe reaction he was after, though, was not forthcoming and West Ham fans instead kept themselves entertained with Tevez taunts.\n\nThe result continues Sheffield United's remarkable start to the season as they rise to seventh\n\nThe Hammers meanwhile move up to ninth but could have jumped higher with the three points\n\nShirts bearing the Argentinian's name and masks were waved in the direction of the away fans while 'one Carlos Tevez' was the chant of choice.\n\nThen they finally had something to get excited about in the 44th minute. Sheffield United had defended impressively up to that point but Chris Basham then failed to properly deal with Roberto's long punt, Andriy Yarmolenko collected the loose ball and slipped in Snodgrass to score his first goal since December 15 on his first league start since mid-August.\n\nTwice West Ham should have extended their lead after the break but Yarmolenko and Felipe Anderson both failed to find the finishing touch to the home side's counter attacks.\n\nAnd they were punished when George Baldock's cross was only headed up into the air by Issa Diop and Enda Stevens nodded down to Mousset who shinned the equaliser past Roberto on the volley.\n\nThe Frenchman, a \u00a310m summer signing from Bournemouth, now has as many Premier League goals for Sheffield United in seven games as he managed in 58 for Bournemouth.\n\nIncreasingly-busy England new boy Dean Henderson prevented Aaron Cresswell and Declan Rice restoring West Ham's lead and Snodgrass hit the post before the Scot's late substitution summed up the frustration inside the London Stadium.\n\nPellegrini's decision was loudly booed but the West Ham manager said: 'We had three or four minutes of the game left.\n\n'We wanted to have more players in the box to score the goal to decide the game. We needed fresh legs inside the box to try to score the second goal.'", "description": "ADRIAN KAJUMBA AT THE LONDON STADIUM: \nIt will take an awful lot to make up for a relegation and the 12 years they have spent in the wilderness outside the Premier League.", "authors": ["Adrian Kajumba For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/16/20219592-0-image-a-51_1572104914076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
