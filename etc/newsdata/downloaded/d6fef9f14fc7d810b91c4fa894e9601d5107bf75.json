Another person was wounded and is undergoing surgery.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the assailant's motive was but Jean-Marc Bailleul, a police union leader, described the incident as \"criminal\" rather than an act of \"terror\", the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nFellow union official Loic Travers said the incident appeared to have begun in an office and continued elsewhere inside the large compound, which is located near the Notre Dame Cathedral and several other major tourist attractions. It happened at about 1pm (12:00 GMT).\n\nThe surrounding area was cordoned off in the wake of the attack and the local metro station was shut down.\n\nSpeaking outside the police headquarters, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the attacker was known to his colleagues and had worked for some time in the IT department.\n\n\"He had never presented any behavioural issues, he had never presented the slightest cause for alarm before going on his deadly rampage today,\" Castaner said.\n\nHeitz said police were searching the attacker's home, and the Paris prosecutor's office confirmed the individual's wife had been brought into police custody but not charged.\n\nThe suspect, reportedly an administrative official who worked in the building, was shot dead by police at the scene [ Kamil Zihnioglu/AP Photo]\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe meanwhile visited the site of the attack, while Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote in a post on Twitter that the city \"weeps for its own this afternoon\".\n\nWave of panic\n\nInterpreter Emery Siamandi, who was inside the building when the attack took place, told journalists he heard gunshots and witnessed the wave of panic that spread through the police headquarters with people screaming and crying, the Associated Press news agency reported.\n\n\"I tried to see if it was a terrorist attack or maybe several people had walked in to kill people,\" the AP quoted Siamandi as saying after he was evacuated.\n\n\"I was suspicious and very soon I saw policemen with their guns drawn - they had guns. Where I was, 99 percent of people were policemen.\"\n\nThe police headquarters are located near several major tourist attractions [Kamil Zihnioglu/AP]\n\nThursday's attack came a day after thousands of officers marched in Paris to protest low wages, long-hours culture and increasing suicides in their ranks.\n\nOrganisers estimated that 27,000 officers out of 150,000 police staff nationwide took part, the AFP news agency reported. No independent estimate was available.\n\nPolice officers have also been the target of several other deadly attacks in recent years.\n\nIn 2017, a gunman opened fire on the Champs-Elysees boulevard, killing one officer before he was shot dead.\n\nA year earlier, an attack inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) group killed a police officer and his companion, an administrator, at their home in front of their child.", "description": "The attacker, an administrative assistant who worked in the police headquarters, was shot dead by police at the scene.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/3/78455a1368194931aec9af285ba14515_18.jpg"}
