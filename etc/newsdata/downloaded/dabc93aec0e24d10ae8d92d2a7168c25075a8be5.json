That investment will mean that stations serving more than 60 percent of subway passengers will be wheelchair accessible.\n\nAll of which is more than New York City Transit president Andy Byford had been hoping for.\n\n\u201cI am ecstatically happy,\u201d Byford said Monday. \u201cI mean, this could not be better.\u201d\n\nThe plan calls for a $7 billion investment into resignaling portions of six subway lines, which will enable more trains to run along those lines, increasing their capacity. Right now, only the L and 7 lines have modern signaling. They each consistently out-perform the rest of the system.\n\nThe plan calls for a $1.6 billion investment in the second phase of the Second Avenue Subway, up to 125th Street, a roughly 1.5-mile extension that\u2019s slated to cost some $6 billion. That cost falls far out of line with comparable systems elsewhere in the world.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a longer conversation about the comparisons to other places,\u201d said Janno Lieber, the capital construction chief who will be shepherding the program.\n\nThe plan includes $2.3 billion for new buses, 500 of which will be all-electric. There\u2019s also nearly $6 billion for the Long Island Rail Road and nearly $5 billion for Metro-North, including funding that will enable some Metro-North riders to disembark in Penn Station.\n\nLieber said some projects would likely outlast the plan\u2019s five-year timeline, much as the MTA has yet to spend all of the $33 billion in its existing capital plan. Even so, Foye promised that the authority would not be moving elements from the current plan to the new one in some sort of financial sleight of hand meant to increase the apparent size of the new investment \u2014 a prospect some advocates have feared.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rollover,\u201d Foye said.\n\nWhile the program relies on funding from the congestion pricing scheme set to go into effect in 2021, as well as excess revenue from the MTA\u2019s bridges and tunnels, it \u2014 crucially \u2014 also relies on nearly $11 billion in funding from the Trump administration, $3 billion from the de Blasio administration, and $3 billion from the state. The governor is on board. It\u2019s not clear where the de Blasio and Trump administrations stand.\n\nMTA officials briefed reporters on the capital plan Monday morning. Under the terms of that briefing, reporters were precluded from reaching out to any other parties for comment prior to 1 p.m., when the news embargo would be lifted.\n\nDuring the briefing, a reporter asked Foye what, if any, discussions the MTA or the governor had had with the de Blasio administration.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting with folks from City Hall today,\u201d Foye said. \u201cThe numbers that we are discussing are consistent with what the city and the state have done in the past.\u201d\n\nHe said the city\u2019s $3 billion would go toward making the subway more accessible to people in wheelchairs, the elderly and caregivers pushing strollers.\n\nThe 50-50 split between the city and state is a departure from the past cost-sharing rubric, in which the city promised $2.5 billion and the state promised $8.3 billion. The state and city did split the cost of the much smaller subway stabilization plan, Foye noted.\n\nThe Trump administration has shown reluctance toward funding New York infrastructure priorities, though the president did suggest he supported the Second Avenue Subway in a tweet that befuddled local transportation officials.\n\nFoye argued it only makes sense for the Trump administration to fund the MTA, because \u201cthese are projects, frankly, of national significance.\u201d\n\nThe MTA is still hoping to submit the plan to a state review board for approval by October 1. The MTA board is expected to vote on it later this month.\n\n\u201cThis is our vision for what it will take to revitalize the transit system in New York,\u201d Foye said.", "description": "The proposed plan represents \u201cthe largest ever in the public transit system,\u201d according to MTA chairman and CEO Pat Foye.", "authors": ["Dana Rubinstein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/75/3b/a5252aaa4acb85492a0b887b4d2a/170816-new-york-subway-mta-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
