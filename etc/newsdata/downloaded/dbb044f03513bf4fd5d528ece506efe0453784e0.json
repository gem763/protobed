Welcome to America, land of the freedom dividend.\n\nThe Commentary\n\nThe third Democratic debate began with a vow from Andrew Yang to give away $1,000 a month for a year to 10 families, selected randomly in a sweepstakes. This absolutely-not-a-bribe, as it turns out, is a neat metaphor for the hours upon hours of crosstalk that voters have been treated to this summer. For everyone but the three top-tier candidates, these evenings put together are one long contest of luck.\n\nFor the first two debates, who was matched with whom? For this one, who made the arbitrary cut? Does a candidate get speaking time proportionate to their place in the polls, and more importantly, do they get speaking time in the right segments? Does the moderator cut them off when their time has elapsed, or has she already given up by that point in the night?\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47!\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke exclaimed in a breakout moment. But it\u2019s too late for him; you know you\u2019re not a contender when everyone else is singing your praises all night. And Kamala D. Harris turned on too early, back at the first debate.\n\nOf course, candidates are going to take shots at one another, sometimes tinged with substance and sometimes all sound bite. Of course they\u2019re going to \u201cgo on \u2026 twice over!\u201d as Joe Biden complained. How else are they supposed to get noticed?\n\n\u201cYeah, that's called the Democratic primary election,\u201d said Juli\u00e1n Castro, who gambled on attacking Joe Biden for \u201cforgetting\u201d what he had said minutes ago \u2014 or, in other words, being an old guy. Looks like he\u2019s banking on a VP slot \u2026 alongside someone else than the septuagenarian front-runner.\n\nDid anything stick? We\u2019ll see soon enough. Mostly, though, the evening seemed winnerless. Slightly longer answers offered slightly more substance; distinctions on policy points became more distinct still, especially when it came to health care. The debate wasn\u2019t useless for America, but it might have been relatively useless in changing anything meaningful about the race. So congratulations to Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nThere\u2019s some consolation, at least. Everyone, Yang promises, will get democracy dollars.\n\n\u2014 Molly Roberts\n\nThe Ranking\n\nPosition Challenger Change Over Last Ranking 1. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 2. Joe Biden \u2014 3.
