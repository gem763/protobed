But it was not just the goal that marked him out on the banks of the Thames.\n\nConor Gallagher scored for Charlton against Fulham on Saturday afternoon\n\nThe midfielder made a well-timed run into the box and managed to find the back of the net\n\nGallagher was everywhere, recovering the ball and getting to any 50-50 opportunities. At Craven Cottage, he looked like a player ready to make an impression in another part of west London in the coming years.\n\nIt followed a week in which Gallagher, who is playing in his first season of senior football, has starred in three impressive performances against Championship promotion candidates in Fulham, Swansea and Leeds.\n\nManager Lee Bowyer, no scrub in midfield during his own playing days that saw him reach the Champions League semi-finals with Leeds, revealed Chelsea have been keeping a close eye on his progress.\n\nBowyer said: 'For a 19 year old kid who has never played men's football, he's surprised everyone I think.\n\nCharlton manager Lee Bowyer has been impressed by the loanee throughout the season\n\n'He's surprising Chelsea as well. They didn't know how far he could go so soon. Chelsea people came in.\n\n'(Claude) Makelele came in on Thursday to speak to us and talk about the loan and ask how Conor is and give their thoughts and everything. He's going to be one to watch.'\n\nMakelele's interest in his progress will almost certainly come as a huge boost to Gallagher. Not only was he the midfield linchpin during Jose Mourinho's early successes at Stamford Bridge, but he took on a role as young player technical mentor at Chelsea in the summer.\n\nPart of his remit has been keeping an eye on those who have moved away from Chelsea on temporary moves.\n\nChelsea young player technical mentor Claude Makelele has been keeping an eye on him\n\nGallagher himself believes Lampard has given him a 'hope' of breaking through after seeing a group of players who went out on loan in the Championship last season take that step: 'They have managed to get into Chelsea's first team. That is the dream for me.'\n\nHis strike was straight out of Bowyer's playbook \u2014 a late run into the box to get onto the end of a ball headed across.\n\nGallagher hailed Bowyer's impact on him: 'He's great. I've only worked under him for a couple of months now but I've loved it.\n\nGallagher also hailed the impact of Bowyer on his development so far this campaign\n\n'He was a midfielder back in the day and knows his stuff. He has played at the top level so it's a lot to learn to make the box every time and that is how I've scored my goals this season.\n\n'I am looking forward to working under him for the end of the season.'\n\nThere was a glint in Bowyer's eye when he was asked about Gallagher and replied: 'He's not a bad player'.\n\nEven he knows that he might have something special on his hands.", "description": "If you're looking for the next player off the Chelsea production line, Conor Gallagher is a good bet.
