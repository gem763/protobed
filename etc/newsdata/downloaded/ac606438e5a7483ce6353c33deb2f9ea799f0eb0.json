While it may be hard for some to buy bras in Japan, there\u2019s nothing that should stop you from taking care of your breast health.\n\nAccording to their (and government research), nearly 40 percent of women in their 20s, and almost 45 percent of women in their 30s in Japan have not (or do not) get their annual physical examinations. In comparison, both rates are higher than men in Japan who do not get regularly screened.
