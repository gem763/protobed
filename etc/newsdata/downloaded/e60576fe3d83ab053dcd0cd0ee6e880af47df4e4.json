Channel 4 postponed the broadcast of a documentary about evading border checks into the UK.\n\nAll of which is entirely right and proper. It has to be preferable to live in a country where this is the prevailing response to such deaths than in one where the public sentiment was negative, even vindictive.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

And the risk now is that they may not be asked at all, as the discussion veers away into a hue and cry about organised crime half a world away, now it has been established that all the victims were Chinese.\n\nBut those questions, which relate primarily to the UK and its security and asylum policy need to be asked. It is all very well for Shaun Sawyer, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council \u201clead\u201d (in the jargon) for modern slavery and human trafficking, to tell the BBC in the wake of the Essex deaths that \u201cyou can\u2019t turn the UK into a fortress\u201d, but one of the most elementary duties of a state is to control its borders, and the evidence of recent years, such as it exists, suggests that this country is not very good at it. This is partly why \u201ctaking back control\u201d proved such a winning slogan for Leave before the EU referendum.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 39 bodies found in lorry container in Essex Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Additional checks were reportedly introduced on containers after 58 Chinese people were found dead in the port of Dover 19 years ago. But is the latest incident a one-off, an attempt by Chinese gangs perhaps, to revive an old method after a long interval? Or is it rather a sign that other, maybe many other containers, have been crossing into the UK undetected?\n\nAnd even if we allow that a container transporting 39 people may be an exception, smaller-scale arrivals by lorry are not. Many of the media reports on the container tragedy included just a couple of lines to the effect that, on the same day, nine people, suspected migrants, were rescued from the back of a lorry on the M20 in Kent. How often does this happen? How many in a week, a year?\n\nThe general lack of transparency is scandalous. The only way it became known that several thousand would-be migrants had arrived in the UK in the summer of 2015 during the general European migrant crisis was from a report by the then Chief Inspector of Prisons, published more than six months later, condemning the conditions in which many of them were (temporarily) held.\n\nThis summer there has been a similar official reticence about the people crossing the Channel in small boats. Oh, it\u2019s not a big problem, is the impression left by official pronouncements, even as the defence secretary deploys bits of the navy for show. Of course, the authorities do not want to inflame public opinion, but the lack of authoritative figures \u2013 it would seem to be around 1,000 \u2013 only stokes fears that something is being concealed (like the inability of the UK coastguard and navy to police the border).\n\nThe second and third questions challenge two assumptions that underlie much of the discussion about migration, especially as it is conducted at the liberal end of the political spectrum. One is that people have to be desperate to make the high-stakes decision to leave their homeland \u2013 whether it is war, famine, poverty, or lack of rights \u2013 and then risk jumping on to a lorry or a moving train or being crammed on to a leaky boat. This is not always completely true, however.\n\nIn some cases, especially trafficking cases, people are misled as to the future that awaits them. In others, they have come so far that they cannot turn back. But the conclusion we are supposed to draw from this is that such desperate people cannot, morally, ever be turned away.\n\nThere is, though, an answer, and it\u2019s the same answer that a senior French politician of the left \u2013 whether it was Michel Rocard or the founder of Medicins sans Frontieres and health minister, Bernard Kouchner \u2013 gave many years ago: \u201cWe cannot take upon ourselves all the misery of the world.\u201d\n\nThat may be regrettable, but it is true \u2013 and the internationally recognised conditions for residency and asylum need radical updating to match the realities of today\u2019s world.\n\nThe other theme \u2013 much favoured by charities and others \u2013 is that the best way to prevent hazardous journeys is to create legal paths into Europe. Shaun Sawyer\u2019s answer to this was that there would still be those for whom illegal routes would be the only resort, and he is right. There might be a temporary hiatus, while the profiteers adjust, but the market would still be there.\n\nAll of this leaves governments, including the UK government, with a choice. If they want to control, and be seen to control, the borders \u2013 which is a prime demand of many citizens \u2013 they have to be a lot better coordinated than they currently are. They also have to be tougher. I half-wonder whether the popularity in the UK of the so-called Australian points-based system for admitting migrants is because it is assumed that we will adopt another part of this system: dispatching illegal arrivals to inclement island detention.\n\nAnd the fourth question. What message is the UK trying to get out? If it is serious about limiting illegal migration, then it has to send people back \u2013 and make that fact known. According to a BBC investigation, 27,860 people were arrested for illegally entering the UK between 2013 and April 2016. It is not known how many are still here.\n\nHow many of those who succeeded in crossing the Channel by boat this year have been returned? Five per cent. Arriving illegally, even via other, entirely safe, countries, is no bar to receiving asylum or the right to remain. Maybe you think that is right. But why, as a would-be migrant, would you think the risks in trying to reach the UK were too high, when the odds on ever having to leave are so low?\n\nAs if the chances of being allowed to stay were not well known enough already, the BBC and others served up a graphic illustration. Even as the Essex container stood as a warning about not trying to reach the UK illegally, all over the airwaves was the thoroughly personable Ahmad al-Rashid, who had featured in a documentary about trying to reach the UK from war-torn Syria in 2015. Admitting that he had made some of his journey on the back of a lorry, he expressed delight in his current circumstances, having been granted asylum and been joined by his wife and child.\n\nNot only did Rashid\u2019s account suggest an almost unheard-of efficiency at the Home Office, it offered eloquent testimony to the rewards available at least to some of those who reach the UK illegally. Again, you may think this is the right way to behave and the mark of a civilised society; you may also regard Rashid as an exception \u2013 and you could be right on both counts. But Rashid\u2019s story is not going to deter others from making supposedly risky sea crossings and lorry trips. On the contrary, hope of a similar happy ending will trump the fear of being frozen to death in an Essex business park any time.", "description": "The shocking discovery of 39 bodies in a refrigerated\u00a0container that had arrived in the UK from Belgium received, for the most part, an admirably calm and respectful response, even from our otherwise raucous and polarised parliament, and even from those media outlets generally hostile to migration.", "authors": ["Mary Dejevsky"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/15/essex-lorry-deaths.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
