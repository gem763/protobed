Brexit Tony Blair: All Brits are sick of Brexit\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Sunday the British people all agree on one thing about Brexit: They are sick of hearing about it.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that unites the British people at the moment is a desire to have the thing over with,\u201d he said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS.\u201d \u201cSo if there was another referendum and people voted to leave, well, you\u2019d just have to accept that result and make the best of it. I\u2019m not sure they would. \u201c\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBrexit has tied the British government up in knots, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced parliamentary opposition, even within his own party, over his efforts to leave the European Union on Oct. 31 whether or not a deal has been made with the EU \u2014 a so-called \u201cno-deal Brexit.\u201c Such a departure is likely to lead to disruption of trade with Europe and through Europe, as well as creating issues on Britain\u2019s border with Ireland. Shortages of basic goods within Britain have been predicted.\n\nJohnson is now pushing to hold a new general election.\n\nCalling the whole situation \u201cextremely difficult to explain,\u201d Blair speculated that Johnson has favored holding a new election rather than a new referendum on Brexit because he has a better chance of coming out ahead.\n\n\u201cI think the reason is essentially political,\u201c Blair said, adding later: \u201cHe thinks if you have a general election, then he can mask the unpopularity of a no-deal Brexit by pointing to the greater unpopularity of the Labour leadership. That\u2019s one bet that I think he\u2019s making.\u201c\n\nFor his part, Blair said he would prefer the issues remain separate.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem and the problem is Brexit and you want to ask the public what does it think, go back to them on the specific. Don\u2019t mix it up with a general election,\u201d he told Zakaria.\n\nJohnson has shown no sign of yielding on any aspect of his Brexit policy. In an interview published Sunday, he compared himself to the Incredible Hulk.\n\n\u201cThe madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,\u201d he told the Daily Mail.", "description": "The former prime minister said the situation remains extremely complicated.", "authors": ["David Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/82/10/80221be149d292e8d673c3b25062/webp.net-resizeimage%20(8).jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
