The Astros are seeking to even the series at two games apiece.\n\n___\n\n10:19 p.m.\n\nJuan Soto drove in the Nationals\u2019 first run with a groundout, but Washington wasted its best chance at a big inning in Game 4 against the Astros.\n\nHouston leads 4-1 after six innings.\n\nAstros manager AJ Hinch lifted dominant starter Jos\u00e9 Urquidy after five innings, and the Nationals immediately put pressure on Houston\u2019s bullpen.\n\nTwo walks and an infield single loaded the bases with one out for Soto, who grounded the first pitch from Will Harris to first to score Gerardo Parra.\n\nHarris then struck out Howie Kendrick to end the threat.\n\nWashington starter Patrick Corbin worked six innings, allowing four runs on seven hits.\n\n___\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nJos\u00e9 Urquidy has retired the last nine batters he\u2019s faced for the Houston Astros, who lead the Washington Nationals 4-0 after five innings of Game 4.\n\nUrquidy has allowed two hits and thrown 67 pitches, 45 for strikes.\n\nHis strong start represents a dream scenario for Astros manager AJ Hinch, who was planning for the possibility of a bullpen day. Gerrit Cole will start Game 5 on full rest against Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer.\n\n___\n\n9:31 p.m.\n\nRobinson Chirinos homered for the second consecutive night, taking Patrick Corbin deep to left on a hanging slider to give the Houston Astros a 4-0 lead after four innings of Game 4.\n\nChirinos is the only player to homer for either team thus far at Nationals Park. The Astros are seeking to even the series at two games apiece. The road team won each of the first three games.\n\nCorbin has allowed four runs on seven hits through four innings, the second consecutive shaky start for the Nationals, who relied on starting pitching to storm their way into their first-ever World Series after making the playoffs as a wild card.\n\nAstros starter Jos\u00e9 Urquidy has outshined Houston\u2019s big-name trio of Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke thus far, allowing two hits in four innings.\n\n___\n\n9:09 p.m.\n\nJos\u00e9 Urquidy is looking less like an \u201copener\u201d and more like a conventional starting pitcher for the Astros.\n\nUrquidy worked around a leadoff double from Yan Gomes to keep the Nationals scoreless through three innings in Game 4. He has allowed two hits and thrown 30 of his 38 pitches for strikes. The Astros lead 2-0.\n\nHouston manager AJ Hinch said he didn\u2019t necessarily consider Game 4 to be a bullpen day because he was hoping Urquidy could go five or six innings.\n\nIn the top half, Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon made a diving stop of Jos\u00e9 Altuve\u2019s one-hopper down the left-field line. Rendon, an MVP candidate, has handled four hard-hit grounders through three innings to help out starter Patrick Corbin.\n\n___\n\n8:46 p.m.\n\nPatrick Corbin settled down in the second inning for the Nationals, using nine pitches to retire the Astros in order on three groundouts.\n\nJos\u00e9 Urquidy retired the Nationals in order in the bottom half, with two strikeouts.\n\nHouston leads Washington 2-0 after two innings of Game 4. The Astros are seeking to even the series at two games apiece and guarantee a return trip to Houston for Game 6.\n\n___\n\n8:32 p.m.\n\nSlumping Alex Bregman came through for the Astros, one of five consecutive batters to reach base in the first inning as Houston took a 2-0 lead over the Washington Nationals in Game 4 of the World Series.\n\nHouston lost the first two games at home and was seeking to even the series after winning Friday night in Washington.\n\nBregman was 4-for-31 since the start of the AL Championship Series before he lined the first pitch from Patrick Corbin to left-center to score Jos\u00e9 Altuve. Yuli Gurriel followed with an infield single to bring Michael Brantley home.\n\nCorbin got out of the inning with a double-play grounder from Robinson Chirinos.\n\nAstros starter Jos\u00e9 Urquidy allowed a two-out single to Anthony Rendon in an uneventful bottom half.\n\n___\n\n7:58 p.m.\n\nFormer Washington Senators great Frank Howard got a big ovation when he was recognized on the field before Game 4 of the World Series.\n\nThe 83-year-old Howard, nicknamed \u201cHondo,\u201d was the best offensive player on a series of mostly terrible Washington Senators teams from 1965 to 1971, the franchise\u2019s last year in Washington. He hit 382 homers in 16 major league seasons.\n\nBaseball did not return to the nation\u2019s capital until 2005, when the Montreal Expos relocated and became the Nationals.\n\nJanyia Freeman, a young scholar-athlete from the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The academy brings baseball and softball to underserved youth in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. Army Brass Quintet performed the national anthem.\n\n___\n\n7:22 p.m.\n\nAroldis Chapman says he has not yet decided whether to opt out of the final two years of his contract with the New York Yankees, which guarantees $30 million.\n\nChapman was at the World Series on Saturday to receive the AL Reliever of the Year award from Mariano Rivera. Milwaukee\u2019s Josh Hader got the NL honor from Trevor Hoffman.\n\nTraded by the Yankees to the Chicago Cubs in July 2016, Chapman returned to the Yankees as a free agent that December for an $86 million, five-year deal that included $15 million salaries in 2020 and \u201921.\n\nThe 31-year-old left-hander received the award a week after allowing a pennant-winning home run to Houston\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Altuve in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series.\n\n___\n\n5:31 p.m.\n\nNationals catcher Kurt Suzuki was out of the starting lineup for Game 4 of the World Series on Saturday night after injuring his right hip flexor.\n\nSuzuki had not been expected to start with left-hander Patrick Corbin on the mound for Washington. Yan Gomes has been Corbin\u2019s personal catcher all season. But Suzuki\u2019s availability for the rest of the series is in question.\n\nSuzuki was pinch hit for in the sixth inning of Washington\u2019s 4-1 loss to Houston on Friday, which pulled the Astros to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.\n\nGomes is 2 for 10 with one RBI in the World Series.\n\nRaudy Reed and Tres Barrera are the other catchers on Washington\u2019s 40-man roster.\n\nNL Championship Series MVP Howie Kendrick was back in the Nationals\u2019 starting lineup at second base, a night after Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera was at second. Kendrick pinch hit and singled in the eighth inning of Game 3. The designated hitter in Houston, Kendrick has three errors in the postseason.\n\nWith no DH, rookie Yordan \u00c1lvarez remained out of the Astros\u2019 starting lineup. George Springer moved from center field to right, Jake Marisnick started in center and Josh Reddick moved to the bench.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Game 4 of the World Series (all times local): 10:38 p.m. Alex Bregman hit the 20th grand slam in World Series history,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/26/9dd2c0_aptopix-world-series-astros-nationals-baseball-71954-houston-astros-alex-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
