It goes into effect in 2022.\n\nUnder state law 'unlawful possession of wildlife' currently carries a fine of up to $1,000 and a six-month jail term.\n\nA dead deer lays on the side of the road in California. A new law would permit motorists to take the animal that they hit and bring it home and use for food\n\nState Senator Bob Archuleta, who sponsored the bill, claims there will now be fewer accidents involving roadkill and vehicles because the dead animals will be taken away.\n\nOver the past six years, some 8,000 accidents involving large game have resulted in more than 1,500 injuries and caused at least dozen deaths of humans, according to data from the California Highway Patrol.\n\n'When you look at the statistics, the number of injuries and accidents and fatalities, it\u2019s about time,\u201d Archuleta told the Mercury News. 'If we can save one life, save one animal, I think we\u2019ve done the right thing here.'\n\nAdditionally, The University at California, Davis estimates more than 20,000 deer alone are killed on California roadways each year.\n\nThe law would cover other animals meandering on California roads, including elk, pronghorn antelope and wild pig.\n\nBut salvaging roadkill is not legal on freeways, where non-emergency stops are prohibited.\n\nUnder the law, if an animal is still alive, the Department of Fish and Wildlife will have jurisdiction to decide whether to put it down.\n\nThose in opposition, though, worry that motorists will purposely target wildlife on the roads.\n\nHowever, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is in favor of the law.\n\nA spokesperson tells DailyMail.com in a statement, 'PETA has no ethical objection to laws that allow the collection of an animal's remains discovered on the side of the road.'\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom during a Sept. 2019 press conference. He signed into a law Senate bill 395 that allows motorists to remove wild game roadkill to cook and eat\n\nCalifornia will join other western states, Montana, Idaho and Oregon in permitting the picking up of carcasses.\n\n'While the best thing for animals, the environment, and human health is to go vegan, roadkill is certainly a superior option to the neatly shrink-wrapped packages of meat in the supermarket, which contain the corpses of animals who spent their lives on a filthy feedlot and were crammed onto a transport truck\u2014and whose throats were slit in a terrifying slaughterhouse,' PETA added in the statement.\n\nThe state will start out with a pilot program in 2022, allowing people who accidentally hit one of those animals, or come across one on the side of the road, to cart the animal home as long as they apply for a free permit within 24 hours, KQED said.\n\nThose who file their permit via an app will also get critical information that includes how to avoid foodborne illness.", "description": "Called 'Roadkill Bill,' California drivers will legally transport wild game to cook.
