But the result fits into a wider continental pattern of far-right, nationalist and populist parties facing increasingly stiff political or institutional resistance and failing to capitalise on their advances in the polls to the extent that many observers had predicted.\n\nAustrian elections: support for far-right collapses Read more\n\nWhile the social and economic discontent and the dissatisfaction with Europe\u2019s mainstream parties that fuelled their recent surge have far from vanished, the populists seem no more able than anyone else in Europe\u2019s fragmenting political landscape to secure clear majorities for their cause.\n\nIn Italy, the former interior minister Matteo Salvini, of the far-right League party, is out in the cold after collapsing the government in the mistaken belief that his soaring poll ratings meant the country wanted a hard turn to the right.\n\nInstead his coalition partners, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, formed a government with the centre-left Democratic party, and while Salvini will doubtless be back, for the moment the nationalists are nursing a self-inflicted bloody nose.\n\nIn elections in two crucial German regions this month, the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party made big gains and posted record scores, but it did not win in either and was shut out of power in both.\n\nIn France, Emmanuel Macron seemed under serious threat earlier this year, shaken by the violent Saturday demonstrations of the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement and the advance of the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen. But the centrist president is now ahead in the polls, his approval rating at its highest since July 2018. With Le Pen failing to land a knockout blow in May\u2019s European elections \u2013 she won by a whisker, and with a smaller share of the vote than in 2014 \u2013 and the French economy faring better than many, Macron will be quietly optimistic.\n\nIn Spain, the far-right Vox party has managed to lose ground in the polls despite the failure of the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to form a government; and support for Thierry Baudet\u2019s Forum for Democracy (FvD) in the Netherlands has plummeted following infighting and divisions.\n\nFar-right and illiberal populism continues to prosper in Poland and Hungary. But elsewhere in central Europe, the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, is facing some of the biggest protests since the fall of communism, and the new president of Slovakia is a progressive liberal.\n\nThe underlying causes of far-right populism \u2013 rising inequality, austerity, fear of immigration, globalisation, automation \u2013 remain, and the parties they sustain are fixtures in Europe\u2019s political landscape. In several countries, far-right policies, particularly on immigration, have been adopted and normalised by both the centre right and centre left.\n\nBut as the Austrian results confirm, the nationalists are not having things all their own way.", "description": "Freedom party\u2019s vote collapses to 16%, as others stall in Italy, Spain, France and elsewhere", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfce72f2cfbde3b8f6da91dc03cc0ff8c7f272a/0_49_3559_2136/master/3559.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7276c313c94b57c96b6f0b586f0fd58d", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
