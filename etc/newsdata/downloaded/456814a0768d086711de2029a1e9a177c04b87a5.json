He said he would push for an election instead.\n\n\u201cI will in no way allow months more of this,\u201d he told MPs.\n\n\u201cIf parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this. And with great regret, I must say that the bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward \u2026 to a general election.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street official confirmed that the government will pull the bill if MPs vote the timetable down and the EU accepts the delay that Johnson requested on Saturday night.\n\nJohnson will push for an election before Christmas. But he would need opposition MPs to back a vote, either in a motion in the Commons or through a no-confidence vote in his government.", "description": "Boris Johnson has gone further than Theresa May ever did in delivering Brexit.", "authors": ["Emilio Casalicchio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1158655869-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
