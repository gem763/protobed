In the mid-17th century, the end times came for the Dutch town of Delft, or at least that\u2019s what residents believed.", "description": "\u2018The Goldfinch\u2019 survived the Delft Thunderclap, went on to become a featured character in a Pulitzer prize-winning novel\u2014and now stars in the not-so-well-acclaimed film adaptation.", "authors": ["Allison Mcnearney"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568495301/190915-mcnearney-carel-fabritius-hero_mxlnhs", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
