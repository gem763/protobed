I do understand when people plead guilty they get reduced sentences because it means victims don't have to testify and the process is quicker, but sometimes the crime is just so despicable you need to cast that aside,' she said.\n\nHer opinion was met by cheers in the crowd, and fellow guest panelist Richard Reid agreed the sentence reflected poorly on the Australian justice system.\n\n'Crimes against children are the most heinous imaginable,' he said.\n\n'To think somebody can go to jail for much longer for far less is sickening.'\n\nHome Affairs Minister Peter Dutton also expressed his frustration over the lenient sentence.\n\nHe described it as 'grossly inadequate' and asked for the case to be appealed.\n\nHOME AFFAIRS MINISTER PETER DUTTON BLASTS DECISION 'I think it is an outrage and I think the State Government needs to take control of these law and order situations in Queensland'. 'You cannot have a young girl taken and put in a situation that no parent could ever imagine for their child, for a child that's sexually abused or abducted, for somebody to get a penalty of about two and a half years is unacceptable'. 'We announced the introduction of legislation that for Federal offences would have minimum mandatory sentencing and in Queensland, they should do the same.' 'This is grossly inadequate, the Attorney-General Darth should appeal this case. Queenslanders wouldn't expect anything other than that.' 'To have this young girl tried the way that she was by this animal is unacceptable. That he wouldn't go to jail for a longer period of time doesn't reflect community standards.' 'The community in Queensland, the ACT, anywhere across the country, expect our most vulnerable to be taken care of. It doesn't send a message of deterrence to somebody who can assault a young child, an infant or a young girl and not receive an appropriate penalty'. 'It has to stop. In many of the cases we looked at before we made the decision to introduce the minimum mandatory sentencing for Federal offences, a majority of people weren't going to jail for sexually assaulting children'. 'In our country, that has to stop. In Queensland, this case should be appealed and the State Government should announce today that they will appeal it'.\n\nIn a letter to the court - that was later read out loud to journalists - Free said: 'I can only ever say sorry. I know that this is not good enough'\n\nThe girl's mother was 'shaken' that Free could be back on the streets in less than two years, although she had been warned that could be the case.\n\n'My tiny innocent girl was well aware of stranger danger, however this person was friendly to her and tricked her into following him,' the mother said in a statement.\n\n'No child should ever have to go through this type of trauma, and no sentence will ever be long enough to make up for the ongoing effects this will have on her.'\n\n'We, as a family, remain positive and are trying to move forward. We would like to thank the Queensland Police Service, the Queensland DPP and the Australian public for their support throughout this ordeal'.\n\nThe judge considered evidence from a psychologist that he had provisionally been diagnosed with a paedophilic disorder and an online porn addiction.\n\nShe also acknowledged he was a victim of child sexual abuse himself, and that victims are more likely to offend.\n\n'The family continues to suffer anxiety which is easily understood,' the judge said.\n\n'It is easy to imagine the mother's distress in the circumstances and you acknowledged as much.'\n\nThe girl's mother remained composed throughout the sentencing. Several supporters appeared upset at the decision.\n\nFree has so far spent 306 days in custody, including five months in solitary confinement.\n\nFree leads the little girl away, in footage shown to the court. The court heard Free lurked in the Kmart toy section corridors before telling her to 'follow me'", "description": "Sterling Mervyn Free, 27, was jailed for eight years on Friday, with a Queensland judge describing his crime as 'abhorrent' and 'every parent's worse nightmare'.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain", "Daniel Piotrowski In Brisbane For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/03/19567720-0-image-a-29_1570759540780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
