We can't start complaining, \"oh what bad luck\". In a few positions there are not many but we have incredibly good players. We're going with them.\n\n'It's not a big issue for Oleks but he'll be out for five or six weeks. They did something to clean the knee, it's not a big thing. He had a contact with a knee and felt something in the bone.\n\nRodri is likely to be absent for next month's crucial trip to Liverpool with a hamstring injury\n\n'They told me that after the international break maybe Rodri will be ready again.'\n\nGuardiola - who hopes Benjamin Mendy is over the worst of his fitness issues following two serious knee problems - insisted that City will not spend in January.\n\n'Well I think we are not going to buy,' he added. 'The club didn't introduce to me the players they thought could help us. So without that it's not going to happen.\n\n'Our need is not just for six months, it's for a long time and the important players will not be sold (in January). We are going to stay all the season, I think, with all the players we have right now.'", "description": "Zinchenko underwent knee surgery in Barcelona on Friday, while central midfielder Rodri (left) is also likely to be absent for next month's crucial trip to Liverpool after sustaining a hamstring injury.", "authors": ["Jack Gaughan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/20/20194316-0-image-a-87_1572030827705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
