It is known to cause memory loss, violent moods and other cognitive difficulties. It can only be diagnosed after death.\n\nMikita is the eighth former NHL player diagnosed with CTE at the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank, a list that also includes Derek Boogaard, Bob Probert and Reggie Fleming.\n\n\u201cThe NHL is nowhere on this,\u201d McKee said. \u201cThey have completely denied a link. They have denied any responsibility, and it\u2019s clear that they are just protecting the bottom line.\u201d\n\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has consistently denied there is a conclusive link between repeated blows to the head and CTE. A message was left late Friday night seeking comment from the league about Mikita\u2019s diagnosis.\n\nThe NHL formed a concussion study group in 1997, cracked down on certain hits after the 2004-05 lockout, instituted a formal protocol and a rule against head contact in 2010, and added spotters in 2015.\n\nMcKee said she feels the concussion spotters are being too lax in having players examined.\n\n\u201cThey need to really, really just be very conservative about what represents a hit,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause what looks like a minor hit to you or me when we\u2019re looking at it can be a devastating hit to the player, and we need to keep these players safe. That\u2019s how these leagues got to be what they are.\u201d\n\nMikita, who helped Chicago to the 1961 Stanley Cup title, died last August at age 78. He had been in poor health after being diagnosed with Lewy body dementia - a progressive disease that causes problems with thinking, movement, behavior and mood.\n\nMcKee said Mikita had Stage III CTE and Lewy Body Disease.\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting was he didn\u2019t just have CTE, which we know is associated with contact sports,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we\u2019re finding out that there are other neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Lewy Body Disease, which is a Parkinson\u2019s sort of disease that spreads through your brain, believe it or not, that\u2019s associated with contact sports.\u201d\n\nMikita spent his entire career with the Blackhawks, beginning with his NHL debut in 1959 and running through his retirement after playing 17 games in the 1979-80 season. He is the franchise\u2019s career leader for assists (926), points (1,467) and games played (1,394), and is second to Bobby Hull with 541 goals.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1983. He also was the first player to have his jersey retired by the Blackhawks in 1980.\n\nMikita\u2019s family declined to speak with the media at the dinner. Mikita\u2019s daughter, Jane, accepted the 2019 Courage Award on behalf of the family.\n\n\u201cWhile my dad\u2019s professional hockey accomplishments were many, we are most proud of his legacy of giving back and caring for others,\u201d Jane said during her speech.\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A posthumous study of Stan Mikita's brain shows the hockey Hall of Famer suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy at the time of his death a year ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jay Cohen"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/mikita_brain_hockey_79610_c0-78-1872-1169_s1770x1032.jpg?c5911d533174b0c07f7907d518c0b5feb877f8b3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
