The photo depicts Trudeau wearing a turban and robe, with dark makeup on his hands, face and neck.\n\nLiberal Party spokesman Cameron Ahmad confirms the photo is of Trudeau. He says it was taken at the school\u2019s annual dinner which had an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d theme that year. Trudeau was dressed as a character from \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\nTrudeau, who launched his reelection campaign exactly one week ago, said he should have known better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself, I\u2019m disappointed in myself,\u201d Trudeau told reporters traveling with him on his campaign plane.\n\nThe photo\u2019s publication could spell more trouble for Trudeau, who polls say is facing a serious challenge from Conservative leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nTrudeau has been admired by liberals around the world for his progressive policies in the Trump era, with Canada accepting more refugees than the United States. His Liberal government has also strongly advocated free trade.\n\nBut the 47-year-old son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was already vulnerable following one of the biggest scandals in Canadian political history, which arose when Trudeau\u2019s former attorney general said he improperly pressured her to halt the criminal prosecution of a company in Quebec. Trudeau has said he was standing up for jobs.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Canadian leader Justin Trudeau's campaigning for national elections has been hit by the publication of a yearbook photo showing him in brownface makeup at a costume party in 2001.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/trudeau_brownface_photo_29664_c0-155-3498-2194_s1770x1032.jpg?e0fa0385fdad8707751b0133d3c615034a8f9b7a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
