Combine that with the earnings today being good and happy days are here again,\u201d said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.87% while the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of leading European regional shares closed up 0.93%. The broad pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.11%.\n\nThe market is at an inflection point and may get good news from two major headwinds, the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.\n\n\u201cThings with Brexit are apparently moving pretty quickly,\u201d Joy said, adding investors remain skeptical about a Brexit deal.\n\nOptimism over a potential Brexit deal helped allay concerns about a slowing economy brought on by the U.S.-China trade war, which has crimped German exports.\n\nBut the mood among German investors worsened less this month than analysts had expected, a ZEW survey showed, amid concern that Europe\u2019s biggest economy might be headed for recession.\n\nZEW\u2019s headline economic sentiment index, which in August touched its lowest in almost seven years, appears to have stabilized. Investor assessment of German\u2019s current economic condition in October was as pessimistic as it was in 2010.\n\nUpbeat results from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Johnson & Johnson JNJ. eased concerns about the impact from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war on corporate America.\n\nJPMorgan hit a record high and rose 3.01%, while UnitedHeath jumped 8.16% and J&J added 1.62%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 237.44 points, or 0.89%, to 27,024.8. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 29.53 points, or 1.00%, to 2,995.68 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 100.06 points, or 1.24%, to 8,148.71.\n\nChinese stocks snapped a five-day winning streak after the latest factory gate data added to China\u2019s economic woes and the end of the trade war remained elusive.\n\nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.15%, with the euro EUR= up 0.04% to $1.1032. The Japanese yen JPY= weakened 0.40% versus the greenback at 108.86 per dollar.\n\nSterling GBP= rose to $1.2774, up 1.33% on the day.\n\nOil futures closed lower. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 61 cents to settle at $58.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 dropped 78 cents to settle at $52.81 a barrel.\n\nPrices for the benchmark U.S. Treasury\u2019s 10-year note US10YT=RR fell 4/32, pushing its yield up to 1.7692%.\n\nEuro zone government bonds sold off after media reports that UK and EU negotiators were close to a draft deal on Brexit boosted investors\u2019 risk appetite.\n\nIrish government bonds outperformed euro zone peers on Brexit hopes. Yields on Irish 10-year bonds were back in negative territory at -0.02% IE10YT=RR after sliding 6 basis points on the day.\n\nDublin-listed shares surged 2.6% to the highest since September 2018 .ISEQ.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the closing bell in New York, U.S., October 2, 2019.
