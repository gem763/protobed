Happ.\n\nCorrea watched the ball sail, then held up one finger as he rounded the bases. As he approached home plate, he tossed his helmet as if shooting a basketball at the crowd of teammates waiting for him.\n\nGame 3 is Tuesday afternoon at Yankee Stadium. Gerrit Cole, who is 18-0 in his last 24 starts and led the majors in strikeouts, starts for the Astros against Luis Severino.\n\n\u201cThe game of baseball, it\u2019s a beautiful game,\u201d Correa said.\n\nThe Yankees tied a League Championship Series record by using nine pitchers. The eight relievers had permitted only one run and two hits with 11 strikeouts before Correa homered, ending a game that took 4 hours, 49 minutes and ended just before midnight.\n\nHouston\u2019s five relievers combined for 4 1/3 innings of one-hit shutout ball after taking over for Justin Verlander. Going into this best-of-seven series, the Yankees were considered the better team in the bullpen - the Astros amply held their own in this one.\n\n\u201cOur bullpen was nasty, gave us a chance to win the game,\u201d Correa said.\n\nGary S\u00e1nchez struck out looking to end the Yankees 11th with runners on first and second. The pitch appeared outside - it came right after he swung and missed with two strikes, but was ruled a foul ball.\n\nNew York lost for the first time this postseason after four wins.\n\n\u201cIt was a struggle tonight,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cThey\u2019re tough to score runs off, especially on a night when Verlander is out there.\u201d\n\nAaron Judge put the Yankees on top 2-1 with a two-run shot off Verlander in the fourth. It was his first homer this postseason and the eighth in his playoff career.\n\nGeorge Springer tied it in the fifth with his franchise-record 12th career postseason home run. The 2017 World Series MVP connected on the first pitch after reliever Adam Ottavino entered.\n\nCorrea was sidelined for a while late this year because of back trouble. The All-Star began the day in a 3-for-22 skid this postseason.\n\nAlong with his bat, he made the key play in the field to keep it tied at 2 in the sixth. With runners at first and second, and on the move on a full-count pitch with two outs, Brett Gardner hit a hard grounder that bounced off second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve for a single.\n\nThe ball bounded away and Correa quickly retrieved it and threw a strike to catcher Robinson Chirinos, who tagged out the sliding DJ LeMahieu.\n\nVerlander pumped his fist and screamed \u201clet\u2019s go!\u201d as he came off the field and Correa shook his finger with a look that said: \u201cnot on my watch.\u201d\n\nCameras then panned to Verlander\u2019s supermodel wife, Kate Upton, who jumped and cheered from a luxury suite.\n\n\u201cI just tried creeping over and as soon as the ball hit him, I scooped it and he sent him, so I had to gun him down,\u201d Correa said.\n\nCorrea ended an 0-for-14 slump with an RBI double in the second off James Paxton, who lasted just 2 1/3 innings.\n\nHours later, Correa ended it with his drive off Happ.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been successful before going the other way against him,\u201d Correa said. \u201cI was looking for something down the middle that I could drive the other way. He threw a perfect pitch to do it.\u201d\n\nIn a game decided by bullpens, it was quite a relief for Correa.\n\n\u201cNot playing a couple of weeks before the playoffs and then not producing for or my team offensively, obviously it\u2019s tough, getting hurt and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all worth it for moments like this, moments like this where you give your team a chance to win every day, it\u2019s worth it, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tough road this year but I\u2019m finally here and I was able to contribute tonight,\u201d he said.\n\nVerlander entered the game 4-0 in six career postseason starts against the Yankees. He allowed five hits and struck out seven in 6 2/3 innings to bounce back from a tough start in Game 4 of the ALDS where he took the loss while pitching on short rest.\n\nSCARY MOMENT\n\nA man in the Astros dugout who works for the Harris County Emergency Corps was hit by a foul ball off the bat of Houston\u2019s Michael Brantley and exited with a towel over his head. The team released a statement from the company\u2019s CEO, Jeremy Hyde, that said the man was taken to a hospital and was in stable condition.\n\nPlay was briefly halted after the accident in the fifth inning and manager AJ Hinch came on the field to console a shaken-up Brantley.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: Slugger Giancarlo Stanton missed the game with a strained right quad. He homered in the opener. \u201cSo hoping that it\u2019s something that with today and the off day, that he would be back in play for Game 3,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just kind of see how these next 48 hours unfold.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCole was 2-0 with a 0.57 ERA and 25 strikeouts across 15 2/3 innings against the Rays in the ALDS. The 29-year-old led the AL with a career-best 2.50 ERA and was first in the majors with 326 strikeouts in the regular season.\n\nThis will be the eighth postseason start for Severino, who did not factor in the decision in New York\u2019s Game 3 win over Minnesota. Severino, who made just three regular-season starts because of a late injury, allowed four hits in four innings against the Twins.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carlos Correa hit a leadoff home run in the 11th inning and the Houston Astros won a battle of the bullpens, beating the New York Yankees 3-2 Sunday night to tie the AL Championship Series at one game apiece.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/alcs_yankees_astros_baseball_69225_c0-168-4041-2525_s1200x700.jpg?ef0fe3c38cf8ab23d42d6a0086bab3e61d48cfbf", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
