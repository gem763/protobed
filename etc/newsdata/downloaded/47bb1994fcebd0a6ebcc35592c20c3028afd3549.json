Yeah, well that backfired. As Entertainment Tonight reports, Mother Monster invited one of her fans to join her in the spotlight during Thursday night's Las Vegas Residency show, and he ended up casually picking her up. Which is a bold move, but Gaga seemed fine with it, even wrapping her legs around his waist.\n\nThe problem? Our dude started jumping around, and then fully fell off stage, taking Gaga with him. In videos from fans in the crowd, you can see Gaga and this guy fall over from literally every angle and crash then straight into the audience and onto the floor.\n\nNaturally everyone was fully shook by the moment, though not too shook to capture it on camera. Ya know. Priorities.\n\nwhy did the spotlight follow them i'm crying \ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/4cuxovvkHr \u2014 Lady Gaga Facts (@LGMonsterFacts) October 18, 2019\n\nHere's an even closer view of Gaga saying \"I'm okay, I'm okay,\" which turns out she was because she continued with the show right after (though fan accounts claim a medical team was standing by backstage to double check).\n\nLady Gaga had an unfortunate fall off the stage tonight at Enigma after a fan picked her up and tripped.\n\n\n\nGaga crashed down first with the fan falling on top of her. She got right back up and continued the show. We hope both her and the fan are okay.\n\npic.twitter.com/Vx812nSUwE\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Gaga Media \u2b50\ufe0f (@GagaMediaDotNet) October 18, 2019\n\nAnd if you're wondering about the poor guy who dropped Gaga, according to fans he started crying and she brought him back on stage / asked everyone on the internet to be nice to him. My hearrrrrrrtttttt.\n\nImagine after this fall, you stand up and go to the stage and immediately defend this kid and then you sing with him. Only lady gaga can do this, she is real hero, I am so proud. For the whole morning I feel so sad because this happened, I just hope she is ok. pic.twitter.com/NO8iqxO4ky \u2014 Child Of Lady Gaga (@BloodyJudasGaga) October 18, 2019\n\nThere's a cute video of that too:\n\nLady gaga brought back the fan on stage after their fall \u201cEverything is okay, everything is okay...
