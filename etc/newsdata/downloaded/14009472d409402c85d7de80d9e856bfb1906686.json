Bar association members represent investors in securities arbitrations while the foundation promotes investor literacy for consumers so they can avoid money losses due to bad financial advice.\n\nExpungement \u2014 when brokers totally wipe clean their record of complaints \u2014 is supposed to be a rare step, but arbitrators signed off on 81% to 93% of brokers\u2019 expungement requests between 2015 and 2018, according to the report.\n\nPIABA Foundation officials are referring to proceedings that happen within the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a nonprofit organization overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission that supervises brokerage firms. There are nearly 630,000 brokers registered with the organization, FINRA statistics show.\n\nWhen investors have a problem with their broker, they can file a complaint in the database that FINRA and state regulators maintain.\n\nInvestors can see the complaints using FINRA\u2019s \u201cBrokerCheck\u201d tool. \u201cThe vast majority of all customer disputes involve a recommendation of an unsuitable investment,\u201d said attorney Jason Doss, the foundation president and co-author of the report.\n\nBrokers can either blot out complaints during FINRA arbitrations with aggrieved investors, or they can do it in a special type of arbitration later on, the study said.\n\nThe problem, according to the report, is a big shift to expungement requests that brokers file later on \u2014 typically with little notice to the customer and after the underlying matter has been settled.\n\n\u2022 These cases accounted for 1,078 of the 2,044 arbitrations seeking expungement between 2015 and 2018, the report\u2019s authors said. In that four-year period, the filing rate on these types of cases rose 924%.\n\n\u2022 In the 1,078 \u201cexpungement-only\u201d cases at issue, brokers asked to wipe out 2,194 complaints.\n\n\u2022 Customers objected in about 13% of the expungement requests.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s there to oppose these requests,\u201d Doss said, noting arbitrators are ethically bound from taking an opposing side when there\u2019s no one else to do it.\n\nThe BrokerCheck site has a disclaimer telling users it reveals any felony convictions a broker has, and any misdemeanor convictions \u201cthat are investment-related or involve theft or a \u2018breach of trust.\u2019\u201d The PIABA Foundation report only discussed broker efforts to scrub away customer complaints, not criminal convictions, Doss told MarketWatch.\n\nMore than a quarter million unique visitors browsed the BrokerCheck site during one month last year, according to an August study from Stanford Law School and Harvard University professors.\n\nThe same study predicts a worrying future for some brokers who wipe away the past. \u201cExpungements significantly predict future misconduct; brokers with prior expungements are 2.5 times as likely to engage in new misconduct as the average broker,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nFINRA is already considering extra rules around the expungement process, such as the random, computerized selection of arbitrators from a specialized panel.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is important to ensure that there is an appropriate process for investors to access information that is relevant to them about their financial advisers\u2019 prior experience, while also providing financial professionals the opportunity to address incorrect or inaccurate information,\u201d a FINRA spokeswoman said Tuesday.\n\nShe noted that FINRA\u2019s board has approved rule proposals \u201caimed at improving the expungement process including a proposal to create a special roster of arbitrators with heightened qualifications and training to hear certain expungement requests. We will next file the rule proposals with the SEC.\u201d\n\nThe PIABA Foundation report said that FINRA\u2019s proposed training for a specialized arbitrator panel doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nAmong its proposed fixes, the organization says all cases seeking to erase customer complaints should be paused until tighter rules are in place.\n\nThe organization says FINRA or the SEC should also name an \u201cinvestor protection advocate\u201d to press for the customers\u2019 side in all expungement cases \u2014 even if the customer doesn\u2019t participate.", "description": "Brokers have been asking for their complaint records on BrokerCheck to be wiped clean at soaring rates.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT382_broker_ZG_20191015220621.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
