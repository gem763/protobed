It took us a bit of time for it to sink in,\u201d Gatland said.\n\n\u201cYou have to deal with adversity at times. You lose key players at times and have to respond to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to say, the players in the last 24 hours have really stepped up and been incredibly responsible and resilient. Sometimes that brings teams closer together.\u201d\n\nFormer Wales flyhalf Stephen Jones will step into the role of attack coach and is expected to arrive in Japan on Thursday, well in time for the start of the Pool D campaign against Georgia in Toyota on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe have had some challenges, but having (had) a chat to Stephen, he knows what we do,\u201d Gatland added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the coaches and players will give him as much support as possible and I think he\u2019ll come in and potentially add to the environment. It\u2019s about turning a difficult situation into a positive.\u201d\n\nSix Nations champions Wales arrived in Japan as one of the pre-tournament favourites after recently topping the world rankings for the first time.\n\nHowley, 48, has been attack coach since Gatland took the reins in 2008 and was placed in the top job in a caretaker role when the New Zealander led the British and Irish Lions on their 2017 tour.\n\nLike Gatland, he was set to leave his post after the World Cup and had been linked to the top job with the Italy team. He could face a punishment as severe as a lifetime ban from rugby if the allegations prove founded.\n\n\u201cAt the moment these are allegations,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cObviously Rob was devastated by these allegations. That\u2019s all I can say on that.\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby earlier released a statement supporting the WRU\u2019s proactivity on the matter and Phillips said the body had confidence in the processes put in place to prevent gambling by players and coaches.\n\n\u201cWe do respond well to difficult situations,\u201d said Gatland, adding that it was a \u201cWelsh trait\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe know there will be speculation and criticism in the next 24 hours. We have to deal with that and stay focused. Hopefully rugby is what does the talking.\u201d", "description": "The departure of Wales assistant coach Rob Howley from the Rugby World Cup over a possible breach of rules governing gambling in the sport could ultimately bring the team closer together, head coach Warren Gatland said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431054560&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H05J", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
