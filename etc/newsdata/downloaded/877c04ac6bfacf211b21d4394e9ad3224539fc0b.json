Why do we expect him to be good to his word about anything? I just don\u2019t believe the NHS won\u2019t form part of a trade deal. It\u2019s a multi, multi billion-pound industry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be able to resist putting it on the table.\u201d\n\n(Image: Tim Anderson)\n\nIn June, Donald Trump announced to the world the NHS would be \u201con the table\u201d in any future negotiations with post-Brexit Britain, prompting swift denials from a flustered Johnson.\n\nThat could open the door for US pharmaceutical giants to charge the NHS exorbitant market prices for drugs.\n\nCurrently, they are kept at bay by checks and balances which ensure health service prices are a fraction of US market costs, and the British health service is free for all \u2013 unlike the American system.\n\nThis would, Adam predicts, slowly lead to it becoming, a model of the US health system where citizens pay high prices for health \u00adinsurance, around \u00a37,800 a head, compared to our approximate \u00a32,500 through taxes.\n\nThose who cannot afford that, could pay with their health, or even their lives.\n\nThe 39-year-old added: \u201cAmerica has a very different health care model to us, we should see it as a very scary ghost of Christmas future. People die in the US because they can\u2019t afford drugs.\n\n(Image: Tim Anderson)\n\n\u201cAs soon as there is a two-tier system, people who have the least will suffer the most. Ultimately, if you restrict people\u2019s access to healthcare it will cost lives.\u201d\n\nMr Trump is also trying to scrap his \u00adpredeccesor Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, brought in to help poor Americans.\n\nIn the run-up to the referendum Mr Johnson repeatedly claimed the NHS could get \u00a3350million a week more after Brexit .\n\nPlastered across the Vote Leave bus, the figure was rejected by UK Statistics chair Sir David Norgrove.\n\nHe accused Mr Johnson of \u201cmisusing official statistics\u201d as the net amount paid in 2016 was \u00a3156million.\n\nAdam, who reluctantly quit his medical vocation, eroded by the stress of a stretched system, concedes the PM would label him a \u00ad\u201cgloomster\u201d or \u201cdoomster\u201d \u2013 the PM\u2019s terms for Brexit naysayers.\n\nBut he has built a new career out of telling the truth about the \u00adworsening state of the NHS.\n\nAdam comes from a medical family \u2013 his brother and sister also work in the NHS. Being a doctor was part of who he was.\n\nBut in 2010, aged 30, he found he just could not go on.\n\n(Image: Tim Anderson)\n\nHe became overwhelmed by a stricken system placing unmanageable demands on him, and finally, a traumatic experience in the labour ward, and the scant support offered afterwards to help him deal with it, forced him to quit.\n\nDuring a Caesarean section a patient with an undiagnosed placenta problem began to bleed heavily and Adam couldn\u2019t save the baby.\n\nAfterwards, he finally realised he no longer had sufficient \u201carmour\u201d to cope.\n\nHe later suffered flashbacks and night terrors until he began to share his stories, in the form of an Edinburgh stand-up show.\n\nAdam\u2019s searingly honest first book, This Is Going to Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor, last year\u2019s bestseller, pulled no punches \u2013 either about the humorous sex \u00adaccidents of patients, or the traumatic \u00adexperiences and overwork he faced.\n\nAnd neither is he today. He reveals he has received countless emails from other junior doctors admitting they are similarly \u00adstruggling.\n\nOne sent 18 months ago said it all.\n\nAdam revealed: \u201cIt was from a junior doctor saying they were leaving to re-train\u2026 as a \u00adfirefighter. We are now in a world where that feels like a relaxing alternative to life on the wards.\u201d\n\nAdam has now written a second book, 'Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas, about his six festive periods spent in the NHS.\n\nThe system has only become more stretched since he left the service.\n\nAdam revealed there are more than 100,000 vacancies,10,000 fewer junior doctors than we need, and more than 30,000 nurses.\n\nBut it\u2019s no longer only cuts-driven overwork which is causing an \u201cabsolute crisis\u201d.\n\nThe impending threat of a no-deal Brexit, and the use of the divisive language coming from \u00adWestminster, led by Mr Johnson himself, is driving EU and foreign national workers to quit the health service because they feel \u201cunwelcome\u201d.\n\nAdam personally knows three returning to their native South American countries.\n\nThis is leaving gaping holes which only inflict more pressure on those left behind, and a skeletal system Adam fears may simply not be able to cope with a winter health crisis this year.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NHS is on such a knife edge at the moment because the NHS is its staff, and it\u2019s stretched thinner than its ever been. I don\u2019t know how well it is equipped for a major winter crisis. Staff feel they are not wanted.\n\n\u201cAre you going to wait until an arbitrary date and then, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re out\u2019? The atmosphere in the room changes.\n\n\"How can it not when you\u2019re seeing those posters at the time of the \u00adreferendum of queues of \u00adimmigrants? And when a lot of the language has been extremely \u00addivisive?\n\n\u201cA lot of that language is from Boris, he\u2019s rabble rousing. Us and them.\u201d\n\nThe picture feels \u00adoverwhelmingly bleak.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut although Adam feels the latest fund increase awarded to the NHS \u2013an extra \u00a31.8billion and 20 hospitals across the country upgraded \u2013 is \u201cnot enough, and too late\u201d, he is positive the damage isn\u2019t \u00adirreversible just yet.\n\nHe said it needs a big \u00ad\u201cgrown-up\u201d and \u00ad\u201ccross- political\u201d discussion, where politicians can make important decisions about funding without worrying for their jobs.\n\nAlthough he publicly lambasted then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt for his handling of the junior doctors\u2019 strike in 2016, a meeting with the current minister Matt Hancock in April fared better.\n\nAdam suggested NHS staff needed more psychological support \u2013 one way to help retain numbers and arrest the deluge of people quitting like he did.\n\nAnd he believes investment has been made into the Practitioner Health Programme for staff dealing with mental health issues.\n\nIt is a great step forward that he is proud of. Because ultimately, it\u2019s the workforce of the NHS which makes it what it is.\n\nAdam added: \u201cThe NHS isn\u2019t buildings and bedpans and CT scanners. It\u2019s 1.4million people.\u201d\n\n'Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas published by Pan Macmillan is out now, \u00a39.99.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Former Doctor Adam Kay lashes out at prospect of selling off parts of our NHS in a US trade deal, warning of sky-high post-Brexit treatment and prescription costs", "authors": ["Emily Retter", "Image", "Tim Anderson", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20735268.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_image1JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
