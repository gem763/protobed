Even amid a positive trajectory, there are breakthroughs, plateaus, and setbacks. Sometimes, what seems like a step back actually helps propel society forward. The short unhappy life of Ota Benga\u2014the human being exhibited in the Bronx Zoo\u2014demonstrates how one big example of racist ugliness may have resulted in at least one small step toward racial progress.\n\nAlthough the true origins of this sad story begins with the specious theories of superiority whites developed centuries ago, Benga\u2019s tale begins in the early 1900s, in the Belgian-controlled Congo Free State. His life in his community ended when King Leopold\u2019s Force Publique invaded his world, murdering his wife and two children, then selling him as a slave to the Baschilele tribe. This all too familiar outrage took a bizarre turn when an American anthropologist, Samuel Philips Verner, purchased him for five dollars\u2019 worth of cloth and salt. This woefully misguided missionary then brought Benga along with eight other young Africans to star in the 1904 St. Louis World\u2019s Fair.\n\nBenga\u2019s slight build, dark skin, and artificially sharpened teeth\u2014from a ritual called chipping\u2014fit many Americans\u2019 racist stereotype of the African savage.

Benga and his troupe won the gold medal for entertaining the crowds with their dances and other tribal rituals.", "description": "One of the biggest attractions in New York City in 1906 was none other than an African man bought and placed in a cage with apes.", "authors": ["Gil Troy"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492101216/articles/2016/12/17/when-the-times-defended-putting-a-black-man-in-the-bronx-zoo/161217-troy-ota-benga-tease-1_dxmnkz", "published_at": "2016-12-17"}
