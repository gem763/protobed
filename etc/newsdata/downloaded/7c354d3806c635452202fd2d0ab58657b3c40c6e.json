The retired, four-star Marine general suggested the blame lies squarely with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other advisers who are unable, or unwilling, to keep the president out of trouble.\n\nKelly, 69, said he privately cautioned Trump during his final days on the job that he would be impeached if he did not tap a chief of staff with the fortitude to check the president\u2019s bad impulses. Kelly said he does not believe the president would be in this predicament had he stayed.\n\n\u201cI said, whatever you do \u2014 and we were still in the process of trying to find someone to take my place \u2014 I said whatever you do, don\u2019t hire a \u2018yes man,\u2019 someone who won\u2019t tell you the truth \u2014 don\u2019t do that. Because if you do, I believe you will be impeached,\u201d Kelly recalled in an interview at the Sea Island Summit, a political conference hosted by the Washington Examiner.\n\n[Read more: 'Totally unequipped': White House fires back at John Kelly barbs]\n\n\u201cThat was almost 11 months ago, and I have an awful lot of, to say the least, second thoughts about leaving,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt pains me to see what\u2019s going on because I believe if I was still there or someone like me was there, he would not be kind of, all over the place.\u201d\n\nThe House is expected to vote on articles of impeachment by Christmas, with a trial to follow in the Senate to determine whether Trump should be removed from office. The proceedings were sparked by allegations that the president asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival seeking the Democratic nomination.\n\nKelly, Trump\u2019s homeland security secretary before being tapped as his second chief of staff, did not validate impeachment or endorse the inquiry. But he indicated that the White House bears some responsibility for the investigation, saying flatly that it was avoidable \u2014 contradicting many Trump allies who insist congressional Democrats were going to find any excuse to impeach the president.\n\n\u201cSomeone has got to be a guide that tells [the president] that you either have the authority or you don\u2019t, or Mr. President, don\u2019t do it,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cDon\u2019t hire someone that will just nod and say, \u2018That\u2019s a great idea Mr. President.\u2019 Because you will be impeached.\u201d\n\nKelly added, \u201cThe system that should be in place, clearly \u2014 the system of advising, bringing in experts in, having these discussions with the president so he can make an informed decision, that clearly is not in place. And I feel bad that I left.\u201d\n\n[Also read: 'Catastrophically bad idea': John Kelly criticizes Trump's Syria pullout]", "description": "SEA ISLAND, Georgia \u2014 John Kelly warned President Trump that hiring a \u201cyes man\u201d to succeed him as White House chief of staff would lead to impeachment and, in hindsight, regrets his decision to resign.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bcbd06e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+59/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F7d%2F3f%2F87c34c4f4f1f9f1a3e07b62570ff%2Fimage0.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
