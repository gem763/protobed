Biden Jr.\n\nMrs. Pelosi said that amounted to \u201casking yet another foreign power to interfere in the upcoming 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nShe was responding to a letter from Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, who urged Mrs. Pelosi to suspend her impeachment push until she comes up with a set of rules to govern it.\n\nHe said past impeachment inquiries have laid out guidelines about access to evidence, the ability of the president\u2019s lawyers to participate, and what kind of powers the minority party will have to call its own witnesses.\n\nMrs. Pelosi last week declared the House was engaged in an impeachment inquiry but has not said what that means in concrete terms.\n\nInstead, she\u2019s said she\u2019s leaving it to committees to pursue leads.\n\nRepublicans say without a formal vote by the whole chamber, there is no inquiry.\n\nMrs. Pelosi flatly rejected that reasoning.\n\n\u201cThe existing rules of the House provide House committees with full authority to conduct investigations for all matters under their jurisdiction, including impeachment investigations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
