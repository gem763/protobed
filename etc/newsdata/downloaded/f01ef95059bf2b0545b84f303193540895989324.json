(JPM) tacked on another 2.4% Monday on the strength of last week's earnings and continued higher on Tuesday. Jim Cramer said this stock still trades at less than 12 times earnings with nearly a 3% dividend yield that makes it very attractive.\n\nWe looked at JPM last week, recommending that you should \"Go long JPM at current levels, risk to $115 and look for gains to the $150 area by year-end.\"\n\nIn this updated daily bar chart of JPM, below, we can see that prices have been strong all month. JPM is above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe trading volume looks like it has increased the past two months and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has turned upwards this month and is very close to making a new high for the move up.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bullish configuration rising above the zero line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of JPM, below, we can see that prices are in week two of breaking to the upside of a long consolidation pattern. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been moving sideways the past seven to eight months but one strong month like October could turn the indicator higher.\n\nThe MACD oscillator crossed above the zero line in April and it is still very bullish.\n\nIn this updated Point and Figure chart of JPM, below, we can see the breakout to the upside and a price target of $148.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Continue to hold recently recommended long positions. Traders could raise stops to a close below $119 while maintaining our $150 price target.", "description": "In an updated daily bar chart, we can see that prices have been strong all month....JPM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Jpmorgan Chase Continues To Rally", "Here'S How To Play It Now", "In An Updated Daily Bar Chart", "We Can See That Prices Have Been Strong All Month.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "Timothy Collins", "James", "Rev Shark"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/6232aa92-a461-11e7-98b5-135fcca87453.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
