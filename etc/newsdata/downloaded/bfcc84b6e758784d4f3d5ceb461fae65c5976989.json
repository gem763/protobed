The NFL came under special scrutiny on the issue as it pushed back on players' decision to kneel during the anthem -- something players described as a way of protesting systemic racism in the United States.\n\n\"I think what Jay-Z really did in effect was provide the NFL cover for their actions of excluding Colin Kaepernick from employment,\" Hostin said Tuesday.\n\nJAY-Z TALKS NFL PARTNERSHIP, COLIN KAEPERNICK AND SUPER BOWL 2020 HALFTIME PERFORMERS\n\n\"I didn't like it. I mean, he could have done this with Colin Kaepernick and I think that would have been much more powerful.\"\n\nKaepernick, who started the protests as an NFL player, has had trouble getting recruited by NFL teams after his activism started.\n\nJay-Z previously said the nation shouldn't get stuck on the issue of Kaepernick not being able to get a job, and that it should move toward action rather than just protests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe rapper also said, however, that he didn't want people to stop protesting. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want people to stop protesting at all. Kneeling -- I know we\u2019re stuck on it because it\u2019s a real thing -- but kneeling is a form of protest. I support protest across the board. We need to bring light to the issue.
