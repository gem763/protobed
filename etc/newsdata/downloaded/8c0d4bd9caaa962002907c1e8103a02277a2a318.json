What was Biden talking about?\n\nAfter all, the Medicare-for-all plan advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) calls for eliminating premiums, deductibles and co-pays. Yet Biden suggests the plan would raise deductibles.\n\nBiden\u2019s staff acknowledges that he misspoke, repeatedly, in this passage:\n\n* He meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.\n\n* He meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck. (The line he used in the last primary debate was: \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost you in your pay \u2014 there will be a deductible in your paycheck\u201d).\n\n* He meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not \u201c5 percent and 4 percent.\u201d\n\nBiden emphasizes the higher taxes that Medicare-for-all would impose while ignoring the fact that for many middle-class Americans (if you accept Sanders\u2019s math) the change may result in higher incomes and lower health-care costs. It\u2019s a classic political gambit to focus on only half the equation.\n\nRead the full check here.", "description": "\u201cOne of the debates I have with two of my colleagues I greatly respect, both really fine people, is Medicare-for-all. Well, that\u2019s a great idea. But guess what, it costs, minimum, $3.4 trillion per year. That\u2019s twice the entire national budget, except for interest on the debt. Now tell me, especially in a recession, we\u2019re going to raise your taxes, a middle-income person, as Bernie acknowledges \u2014 he\u2019s honest about it \u2014 5 percent and 4 percent in terms of your deductible, as well as 4 or 5 percent on your income tax. I don\u2019t think you can sustain that.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-washpost-wordpress-uploads/primetime/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/10/15183205/AFP_1LF9S5.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
