Discovering the wildlife on Portugal's south coast", "language": "en", "text": "When I first came to the Algarve, it was the Seventies and I was a little boy. Portugal had not long emerged from 50 years of dictatorship and we spent three or four holidays here because Dad was doing business in the area.\n\nI remember fishermen selling sardines from their boats, widows on their doorsteps top-to-toe in black \u2014 and open sewers running down to the sea. The Algarve wasn\u2019t really set up for tourism.\n\nNow, 40 years on, two million or so Britons visit Portugal each year \u2014 with a significant number heading to the Algarve \u2014 which is why the authorities are quaking a little at the thought of Brexit.\n\nSunny days: The cove next to the Tivoli hotel in Carvoeiro. Two million or so Britons visit Portugal each year \u2014 with a significant number heading to the Algarve\n\nTheir response? Promising fast-tracked UK passport lanes at the airport and free healthcare. (They call the policy \u2018Brelcome\u2019.)\n\nA lot has changed since my childhood. This time round, it is far more glamorous and no one is worrying about the plumbing. Indeed, my 13-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter spend happy hours in the hotel spa.\n\nWe\u2019ve split our week in two: the first half in Carvoeiro, a quiet town, the second in livelier Vilamoura.\n\nAt Carvoeiro, we stay in a hotel like no other. From the street the Tivoli looks nothing special.\n\nBut inside there\u2019s a floor-to-ceiling window opposite the reception area, which looks out on a spectacular turquoise cove framed by honey-coloured rock.\n\nAnd it\u2019s so lush. When we open our curtains in the morning, my wife spots yellow and green cycads, spiky agave, giant daisies and fig trees. The children want to get out and about, so we head for Zoomarine, where we\u2019ve booked the Dolphin Emotions experience \u2014 an hour swimming up-close with dolphins.\n\nAn Algarve Jeep safari. The jeeps head into the Barrocal hills, where the buildings give way to carob, cork, olive and almond trees\n\nOur instructor, Victor, waves his arm, twists his finger and blows a whistle; the dolphins jump, twist, clap, then rush back to our side. They\u2019re mesmerising.\n\nAt Vilamoura, we stay in another striking Tivoli hotel: there\u2019s water on both sides \u2014 one side beach, one side posh marina \u2014 and a groovy beach club attached. The manager tells me the windows are free from birds\u2019 mess because \u2018we employ two falcons who work shifts to scare off the seagulls\u2019.\n\nVilamoura is a purpose-built tourist town created in the late-Sixties on some unloved farmland. But we\u2019re more interested in the landscape than the bars.\n\nWe take a boat trip from Albufeira and see dozens of dolphins in the wild, swimming just feet from the boat.\n\nBack on land, we go for a Jeep safari into the Barrocal hills. Buildings give way to carob, cork, olive and almond trees. One moment you can smell orange blossom, then lavender, then carob. I wish my late father could see it.", "description": "Two million or so Britons visit Portugal each year - with a significant number heading to the Algarve.
