The teenage mother sadly passed away on October 7th - surrounded by her family.\n\nTalking about her loss her mother Abbie said: 'We are all in terrible shock, I just want Teegan back. I didn't realise my heart could break into a million pieces. I'll never be the same again.'\n\nNow her devastated mother Abbie Hallawell (pictured with Teegan), 35, who is looking after Parker, is collating pictures of Parker in his mothers arms - so that he can see them when he grows up.\n\nAbbie, Teegan's mother is upset that her daughter won't be able to see her son (pictured) grown up\n\nTeegan's nan June, who also suffered from the loss of two sons, is also devastated by her granddaughters death\n\nTeegan cuddles up to her baby cousin, just months before she gave birth and passed away\n\nHer mother Abbie, wants Parker (pictured) so remember his mother when he grows up by showing him pics in her arms\n\nParker (pictured) who is now 5 weeks old, is being looked after by his grandmother and his father\n\nWHAT IS A CARDIAC ARREST? A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, which is usually due to a problem with electrical signals in the organ. This causes the brain to be starved of oxygen, which results in sufferers not breathing and losing consciousness. In the UK, more than 30,000 cardiac arrests occur a year outside of hospital, compared to over 356,000 in the US. Cardiac arrests are different to heart attacks, with the latter occurring when blood supply to the heart muscle is cut off due to a clot in one of the coronary arteries. Common causes include heart attacks, heart disease and heart muscle inflammation. Drug overdose and losing a large amount of blood can also be to blame. Giving an electric shock through the chest wall via a defibrillator can start the heart again. In the meantime, CPR can keep oxygen circulating around the body.\n\nAbbie, who is now a grandmother and will raise Parker with his father Leon Forster, also spoke about her proud she was of both her daughter and grandson. However, she's upset that Teegan won't be able to see her son grown up.\n\n'She was so looking forward to being a mummy, she was so excited. She would have been the best mummy in the world. She had so much love for him and didn't even get to show him.'\n\nHer mother, who claimed that they were more like 'best friends than mother and daughter,' also praised the hospital where she gave birth and claimed that they were amazing while they went through a traumatic time.\n\nWhile Teegan's grandmother June, who also suffered from the loss of two sons, is also devastated by her granddaughters death.\n\nShe told the Sun how amazing her granddaughter was and how upset she was by the loss.\n\nA spokesman for West Sussex County Council Coroner's Office said: \"Teegan\u2019s cause of death is still under investigation, so no inquest has been opened at this moment in time.\"", "description": "Teegan Barnard, 17, from Havant, Hampshire, gave birth to a healthy boy, Parker, on September 9th this year\u00a0weighing a healthy 9lb 9oz at St Richard's Hospital in Chichester.", "authors": ["Sarah Finley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20028858-0-image-a-10_1571737319155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
