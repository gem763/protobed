They don\u2019t give the full picture.", "language": "en", "text": "President Xi Jinping faces no such obstacles and put on a thunderous show commemorating China\u2019s 70 years of communist rule, complete with hundreds of tanks, floats, planes and a nuclear-capable missile that could evade U.S. missile defenses. As Xi inspected troops, he shouted, \u201cHello, comrades!\u201d They shouted back, \u201cHello, leader!\u201d Trump was surely envious. In a rare gesture of generosity and friendliness to China, he tweeted out his congratulations.\n\nXi has made a striking break with China\u2019s recent past. Since taking power, he has in many ways increased the state\u2019s role in the economy, tightened political control and repression, and embraced a revival of Maoism. What explains this turn backward? Political scientists from the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Michigan recently conducted 77 in-depth interviews with Chinese citizens and concluded that some do indeed have a hankering for the good old days. In their report, \u201cUnderstanding \u2018Red Memory\u2019 in Contemporary China,\u201d the scholars describe this as a \u201creflective nostalgia\u201d for an earlier, simpler time before the breakneck pace of growth and globalization produced a whirlwind of change in every aspect of Chinese society. To put it another way, some Chinese yearn to make China great again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe revived celebration of Mao-era ideology, songs and doctrines has struck many Westerners as bizarre. Mao Zedong, after all, plunged China into some of its deepest crises \u2014 from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution, which killed and displaced tens of millions of Chinese people. But the Communist Party appears to have recognized that in times of ceaseless change, an embrace of nostalgia can be extremely useful. A decade ago, senior party leader Bo Xilai organized mass rallies at which revolutionary-patriotic songs were sung. Bo was later ousted and jailed, but Xi has emulated his approach.\n\nIn a new book, \u201cChina\u2019s New Red Guards: The Return of Radicalism and the Rebirth of Mao Zedong,\u201d Jude Blanchette argues that we have not recognized the deep, internal divisions within the Chinese Communist Party over the past few decades, with many in the party unhappy with the country\u2019s increasingly capitalist direction. \u201cThe party,\u201d he writes, \u201clong the student of Soviet decline, feels exposed on its left flank, and the most effective way to impugn Beijing still remains to point out the distance between its socialist aspirations and the realities of authoritarian state capitalism.\u201d In fact, Xi has said that one of the major reasons Soviet communism collapsed was that the party repudiated its past leaders and ideology.\n\nA central aspect of China\u2019s Maoist revival has been the return to a cult of personality. Early in Xi\u2019s tenure, he cultivated the image of \u201cPapa Xi.\u201d Since then he has abolished term limits for himself, established his own \u201cthought\u201d as comparable to Mao\u2019s own philosophy and generally dispensed with the idea of collective leadership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll this marks a stunning reversal from Deng Xiaoping\u2019s vision for China. Deng, who initiated the 1980s reforms that have created China\u2019s modern economy, once gave a couple of extraordinarily candid interviews to the legendary Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci. In them, he praised Mao but openly acknowledged his greatest failures, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. When pressed by Fallaci as to why they would not happen again, Deng said that they were products of Mao\u2019s cult of personality, his insistence on naming his own successor and his lifetime tenure. Deng explained that none of that would be permitted in the new China. Xi has ignored Deng\u2019s cautionary warnings.\n\nAmericans tend to see China as a monolith, an image encouraged by the Communist Party and its grand parades. In fact, it is a vast, complex society, going through great transformation. Xi is trying to hold it together and maintain control over a dynamic society without provoking a backlash. That is why, with all the military power on display, Xi has been wary about using any of it to quell the riots in Hong Kong.\n\nSocieties confident enough to criticize their leaders relentlessly, investigate their presidents, mock military parades, and honestly examine their past may look messy, chaotic and divided. But perhaps in the long run, they have a deeper resilience and stability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more from Fareed Zakaria\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his daily newsletter.\n\nRead more:\n\nIshaan Tharoor: China\u2019s 70th anniversary party can\u2019t hide a sense of unease\n\nDavid Von Drehle: Xi\u2019s choice: Destroy Trump, or save him and weaken America\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Hong Kong\u2019s protests challenge everything Xi Jinping stands for\n\nJohn Pomfret:What China\u2019s defeat in Hong Kong tells us about the future of Taiwan\n\nAD", "description": "The Chinese president\u2019s big show cannot change this fact \u2014 China is a vast and complex society going through great transformation.", "authors": ["Fareed Zakaria", "Columnist Focusing On Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fA8qE4k8GQWYc0H1U0dnJ4VRl1A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UTPUWBXEOMI6TJXIQ5M4LR7WBA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
