My mandate is clear of the 27 leaders, the EU and the European parliament, safeguarding peace and stability in Ireland and protecting the integrity of the single market.\n\nJohnson has reneged on Good Friday agreement vows, says EU Read more\n\n\u201cLet me therefore put it clearly that based on current UK thinking, it is difficult to see how we arrive at a legally operable solution that fulfils all the objectives of the backstop.\u201d\n\nBarnier went on to insist the EU was open to \u201cnew ideas\u201d should they be proposed. But he added that the talks were in a \u201cvery difficult sensitive phase\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ball is in the court of the British,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UK government has proposed maintaining an all-Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone for agrifood products to ensure that the flow of 30% by value of the trade across the border is unimpeded.\n\nThe EU has said this \u201cpartial\u201d solution does not avoid additional customs and VAT checks on the island of Ireland nor deal with the issue of manufactured goods that cross the border after Brexit.\n\nThe backstop in the withdrawal agreement would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market and the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory in order to maintain peace, protect the north-south economy and avoid border infrastructure of even additional related checks.\n\nOf the UK\u2019s suggestion that customs paperwork could be done away from the border and that technology and trusted trade schemes could facilitate the necessary checks, Barnier and Maas raised doubts.\n\n\u201cObjectively, there are possibilities,\u201d Barnier said, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to inspect a cow with virtual methods.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nMaas said it was \u201cprogress\u201d that the UK had at least made some proposals, but that \u201ceven from a British point of view these presented ideas are not a legal and viable solution\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI have never believed that digitalisation can solve all problems \u2026 In the future what we will do is create a European position to this in close consultation with Michel Barnier. At this moment, all we can say is just that the suggestions are not legal or viable solutions as they have been agreed on in the exit agreement. But this would have to be the case.\u201d\n\nJohnson is meeting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, along with Tusk while in the US.", "description": "Barnier pours scorn on PM\u2019s Irish border proposal as it would not avoid customs and VAT checks post-Brexit", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5791a15f1fb7a9193052396ea34aca52b026fe7d/0_114_4821_2892/master/4821.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=551bb09ded0a254d1a52386c050c3056", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
