How attacks against Schiff are escalating online.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cAs you can see, my tweets are pretty passionate,\u201d Spanbauer, who uses a different name online, said in an interview, adding that she doesn\u2019t specifically wish anyone physical harm. \u201cIt hits very close to home for me. What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \u2014 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that now threatens Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe chain reaction represents a new test of the power of weaponized language to inspire physical violence. Over the summer, Trump faced criticism for employing anti-immigrant rhetoric that was parroted by the man accused of fatally shooting 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso in August. In the fall of 2018, an avid Trump supporter mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats.\n\nWhat many of the violent, anti-Schiff messages have in common is the inspiration they appear to draw from the president\u2019s words, or from the words of his associates and allies in Congress and conservative media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA tweet from Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, arguing that Schiff should be \u201csuspended\u201d was reposted by a user with nearly 50,000 followers who envisioned the congressman\u2019s public hanging in a football stadium. The post remained live as of Sunday.\n\nA tweet from Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), the House majority whip, describing Schiff as a \u201cproven liar\u201d who should be \u201cheld accountable\u201d was reposted by a user with thousands of followers and a longing for the \u201cgood old days when traitors like Schiff would be hanged by the neck until dead.\u201d It also remained live.\n\nA tweet from Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, was reposted by a user with only a small following who envisioned Schiff sitting in front of a firing squad. The post was taken down.\n\nAD\n\nNeither Giuliani nor Schlapp responded to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond. But a spokeswoman for Scalise defended his rhetoric, saying the Louisiana congressman \u2014 among the victims of a shooting at congressional baseball practice in 2017 \u2014 knows firsthand the consequences of extreme language.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs someone who was targeted by a leftist motivated by violent rhetoric towards Republicans, Whip Scalise is well aware of the dangers of that kind of rhetoric,\u201d said Lauren Fine, the spokeswoman. \u201cAdam Schiff has a detailed history of using irresponsible, false and accusatory rhetoric throughout Trump\u2019s presidency, which is what this tweet simply documents in Schiff\u2019s own words.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Schiff said the security of the congressman and his staff is \u201calways a top priority,\u201d declining to go into more detail about specific threats. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police said authorities consult with individual congressional offices on \u201csecurity-related matters\u201d but declined to discuss precautions around the high-stakes impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nThe most graphic and specific threats against Schiff were quickly scrubbed from Twitter, whose policies prohibit threats of violence as well as the \u201cglorification of violence.\u201d At least one additional tweet was removed after it was flagged for the company by The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nBut much of the vitriol remained. And the violent language also reached beyond Twitter, echoing on platforms such as Facebook and 4chan, a sprawling online agora where hate speech and violent threats are routine. A link to an article about Trump\u2019s baseless accusation of treason against Schiff appearing on a Facebook page called \u201cUSA Patriots for Donald Trump,\u201d which boasts nearly 2 million followers, drew a slew of comments about the congressman being hanged.\n\nThe heightened focus on Schiff reflects the extent to which the former prosecutor and longtime Los Angeles-area congressman has become the bete noire of the Trump movement since becoming the de facto head of the investigation of Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist Ukraine\u2019s help in damaging the Democratic presidential campaign of former vice president Joe Biden. Schiff has come under criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans as they seek to delegitimize the inquiry by portraying it as tainted by political bias. The nub of the criticism of Schiff is that he spoofed the president\u2019s call with his Ukrainian counterpart during a congressional hearing and that he made misleading statements about the nature of his prior knowledge of the initial whistleblower complaint.\n\nAD\n\nAnalysts say the pattern resulting in the violent rhetoric targeting Schiff makes evident the radicalizing effect of social media, which Trump uses to stir up his followers against his perceived enemies.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhole online communities are forming around these sentiments, like MAGA,\u201d said Amarnath Amarasingam, an expert on political violence and an assistant professor at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ontario, referring to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan. \u201cThe online social movement of Trump supporters is very real, and a cohort of that movement has come out and said they\u2019re ready to take up arms when needed. This is something a few of us have been worried about for some time.\u201d\n\nThe Web is where the president\u2019s hold over his supporters comes into sharpest focus, the extremism researcher said. On Twitter, his opinions \u2014 and his disparaging views of other politicians \u2014 are received uncritically, Amarasingam added, giving Trump enormous power over his followers and \u201csetting the stage for violence.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome Trump critics have also used sharp language online, making similarly unfounded accusations of treason and noting the maximum penalty: death.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death,\u201d former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Trump for the Republican nomination, said last month on MSNBC of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. The comment was tweeted by a reporter, and retweeted by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.).\n\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was shot in the head in an assassination attempt in 2011, said the responsibility of politicians to \u201cseek the truth\u201d and \u201ctreat their fellow Americans with respect\u201d was heightened \u201cin charged times.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGlobally, public figures are not living up to that responsibility, said Jacob Davey, senior research manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a U.K.-based think tank dedicated to countering extremism and polarization. The result is increasing online radicalization \u2014 not just in the Middle East and Northern Africa, long the focus of extremism research, but also in the heart of the West.\n\nAD\n\nSocial media, he said, \u201chas undoubtedly made engaging in such behavior easier than ever before, with users escaping the legal and social repercussions of their actions.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to craft an alternate universe for his supporters, in which he is the victim of lawless Democrats, rests on an unregulated online ecosystem, where fake news travels faster than the truth.\n\nAD\n\nSpanbauer, who became dissatisfied with Obama during his first term and voted for his Republican challenger in 2012, said she gets most of her news on Twitter and YouTube. Among those she trusts are Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity (\u201cof course\u201d) and Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch (\u201cthank God for Tom Fitton\u201d).\n\nTrump, she said, channels her anger at Washington, while speaking directly to his supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, really, what Trump does on Twitter,\u201d said Spanbauer, who has worked in retail and sales and struggles, along with her husband, to stay above the federal poverty line.\n\nAD\n\nBeneath her verdict on Schiff\u2019s fate, which she acknowledges was hyperbolic, lies a firm conviction that the congressman is guilty of treason \u2014 a crime that the Constitution states is applicable only when waging war against the country or aiding its enemies in doing so.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, she said, is a \u201csupreme insult to our country.\u201d Those leading it \u201cshould be held accountable to the length of the law,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s treason. It\u2019s treason.\u201d", "description": "The California congressman is the target of increasingly vitriolic rhetoric from pro-Trump accounts, a new test of the power of weaponized language.", "authors": ["Isaac Stanley-Becker", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Ni6H151hoYMUMZ3Z6kT-9pYvZks=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NOCRPYHJ3AI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
