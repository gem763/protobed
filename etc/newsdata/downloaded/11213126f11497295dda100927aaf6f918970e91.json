They have also been good to deal with,\u201d Trump said, before mentioning Turkey\u2019s good standing in NATO and announcing that Erdogan will be visiting on Nov. 13.\n\nThe U.S. has continued to attempt to dissuade Turkey from invading Syria and attacking the Kurds, with U.S. troops in the area serving as a buffer between the hostile forces. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that the withdrawal is not an abandonment of Kurdish allies, \u201cwho are special people and wonderful fighters.\u201d\n\nTrump also cautioned Turkey against any potential aggression on Tuesday, stating \u201cany unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency.\u201d That tweet came one day after Trump said that he would \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d the Turkish economy if Erdogan crossed a line.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkish military forces struck the Syrian-Iraqi border to prevent Kurdish forces using the route to reinforce northeast Syria in preparation for an invasion. In the wake of the U.S. withdrawal, Kurdish forces said they may open talks with Damascus and Russia to fill a security vacuum in the event of U.S. military absence, according to Reuters.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "The White House confirmed Tuesday that President Trump will host Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a state visit next month, just one day after Trump confirmed that the U.S. would be pulling forces out of northern Syria in the face of a potential Turkish invasion.\u00a0The initial decision was released", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uJc_QmcLFuR9KdtTDo0UIg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDIzO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/a29cadb8f8951e6361e2b88fcb580d26", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
