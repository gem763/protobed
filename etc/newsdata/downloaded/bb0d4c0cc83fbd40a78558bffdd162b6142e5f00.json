FULL-TIME: Australia 39-21 Fiji 80 mins: As the gong goes again, Fiji win a penalty and are going for one last hurrah as Volavola sends it to the corner. Can they finish with their third try? 76 mins: Australia are nearly in for another try, only for Toomua to get stopped on the line and spill the ball in the tackle. Fiji, to their credit, try to run it out from behind the line and nearly do so, only for referee Ben O'Keefe to pull play back as there was a forward pass in there. 72 mins: The Wallabies are steaming through the gears now. Fiji attempt to clear their lines, but replacement full-back Dane Haylett-Petty runs it back and flings it out wide to the wing Marika Koroibete, who gasses Tuisova for pace and runs it in from deep in the corner. Toomua nails the tricky conversion. 39-21 Advertisement 72 mins: TRY FOR AUSTRALIA! 66 mins: This time the maul doesn't do the damage, but it only takes two phases for Australia to get the ball out to the centre Semu Kerevi who powers his way past Radradra and scores the Wallabies' fifth try of the afternoon. Toomua this time gets the conversion. 32-21 Botia returns from the sin-bin having seen the side ship 14 points while he was off, while scrum-half Lomani is replaced by Nikola Matawalu. 66 mins: Australia come again and are taking full advantage of having a man extra on the field, with Kerevi stepping Nayacalevu and nearly breaking for a try. Fiji manage to turn the ball over and kick clear, but Australia are almost immediately back onto the Fiji line... TRY FOR AUSTRALIA! 62 mins: It's an exact replica of the last try! Australia take clean ball at the lineout, get it to the back of the maul swiftly and Silatolu Latu scores his second try in the space of five minutes. Toomua misses the conversion, but Australia finally have the lead. 25-21 Replacements galore as Michael Cheika swaps the entire Wallaby front row, with James Slipper, Jordan Uelese and Sekpe Kepu on. Advertisement 62 mins: TRY FOR AUSTRALIA! 61 mins: Australia are rampant now and Koroibete breaks from his own 22, out-sprinting Tuisova and reaching the Fiji 22 before he's stopped. Australia attack right and the move is stopped illegally by Levani Botia, who gets a yellow card for his efforts. Australia send the penalty to the corner again. 57 mins: You cant say it wasn't coming. This time the lineout maul is perfectly set up and hooker Silatolu Latu goes over to score. Hodge misses the conversion though, so Australia still haven't lead this match. Replacements for both sides, with Naisarani and Lealiifano off for Australia and Lukhan Salakaia-Loto and Matt Toomua on, and Fiji swapping both props with Eroni Mawi and Manasa Saulo on in the front row. 57 mins: TRY FOR AUSTRALIA! Advertisement 56 mins: It's all pretty messy. Australia get an edge immediately from the driving maul and Fiji have to come in the side to stop it. With a free play, the Wallabies try to spread it but Genia's pass is dreadful and Lealiifano has to send up a high cross-field kick to no one, knowing there's a penalty advantage. We come back for the penalty and Australia go to the corner. 54 mins: Fiji are just starting to struggle with the onslaught coming their way and concede another penalty in kicking range. But Australia turn down the points and go to the corner - they smell blood. 51 mins: Hooper makes a nice half-break through the centre of the park and the Fijian defence comes offside, with one defender diving off their feet for good measure. If gives Hodge a simple shot at goal, which he duly takes to cut the lead. 15-21 Meanwhile, the vastly experienced scrum-half Will Genia comes on for Nic White. 44 mins: What an error from the Wallabies! They try to go off the top from a lineout but a flick back to Lealiifano is off-target and the fly-half drops it. Waisea Nayacalevu pounces on the ball first, and the towering centre has all the speed and power necessary to fend off Lealiifano and run it in from near halfway for Fiji's second! Volavola converts and Fiji lead by nine! 12-21 Advertisement 44 mins: TRY FOR FIJI! 42 mins: Anther change in the Fijian back row at half-time as Viliame Mata is replaced by Tevita Ratuva. That's two of Fiji's three starting back-row forwards already forced off. 41 mins: Fiji kick-off and the second half is underway! Half-time: The players emerge from the tunnel and we're ready to get back underway!
