Saturday would be the perfect time.\u201d\n\nWoodward said England would not mind going into the clash as underdogs and backed them to test the champions.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand were superb but in truth they haven\u2019t yet been fully tested in this tournament since their opening game against the Springboks a month ago,\u201d Woodward added.\n\n\u201cThe stars seem to be aligning a little for England. Eddie has 31 fit players to pick from so he has all sorts of options. New Zealand will rightly be perceived as favourites. Brilliant, play on that underdog label a little.\n\n\u201cEddie has also been lucky with avoiding major injuries, but luck has played no part in avoiding yellow and red cards. Their tackling technique has been exemplary all tournament \u2014 low, arms wrapped well timed and strong.\n\n\u201cThey are helped in this by the Kamikaze Kids, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, neither of whom are giants and both go in low naturally. They are also of the modern generation with habits not so ingrained. They have adapted quickly to the new reality.\u201d", "description": "England are primed to produce an unforgettable performance against New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-finals after Saturday's crushing 40-16 win over Australia, former coach Clive Woodward has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442985009&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0CA", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
