Was it in protest?", "language": "en", "text": "Michael McKinley, a career diplomat and senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has resigned his position amid rising dissatisfaction and plummeting morale inside the State Department over what is seen as Pompeo\u2019s failure to support personnel ensnared in the Ukraine controversy.\n\nA senior officer who has held a range of diplomatic posts, including ambassador to Afghanistan, Colombia and Peru, McKinley was serving as ambassador to Brazil last year when Pompeo recruited him as a policy adviser and a conduit between his office and the career service\u2026\n\nAlthough he had no direct involvement with Ukraine, part of McKinley\u2019s job involved taking the temperature of the building for Pompeo. Like many others, he was disappointed in the secretary\u2019s lack of public support for diplomats who have been named in the Ukraine controversy and called to testify before House committees conducting the impeachment inquiry into the actions of Trump and his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\nConcern has been especially high for Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whom Pompeo recalled from her post when a right-wing media campaign accused her of disloyalty. Yovanovitch had questioned Giuliani\u2019s efforts to press Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Senior-Adviser-To-Pompeo-Resigns"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
