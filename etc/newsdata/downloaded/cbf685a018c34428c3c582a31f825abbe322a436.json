The president\u2019s argument, such as it was, centered around the idea that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff committed all kinds of misdeeds, which Pelosi knew about.\n\nErgo, Trump concluded, both Democratic leaders are equally \u201cguilty\u201d of \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason.\u201d The Republican added that Pelosi and Schiff \u201cmust\u201d be \u201cimmediately\u201d impeached.\n\nEven if we put aside the relevant details \u2013 Schiff obviously didn\u2019t commit any crimes, members of Congress cannot be impeached under our system of government, etc. \u2013 we\u2019re left with an uncomfortable realization: a sitting American president publicly accused the House Speaker of \u201ctreason,\u201d an unprecedented development in our nation\u2019s history, and it quickly became overlooked background noise.\n\nThis is our life now.\n\nThe day after Trump suggested congressional leaders committed treason and should be impeached \u2013 one of these days, someone ought to buy this guy a civics textbook \u2013 the Republican went after Adam Schiff again at a White House event on Japanese trade. Specifically, the American president offered this memorable assessment of the Intelligence Committee\u2019s chairman and his recent paraphrase of Trump during a hearing:\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s having some kind of a breakdown. Because he got up and made a speech that bore no relationship to what the conversation was.\u201d\n\nYes, on the same afternoon in which Donald Trump told the world he has \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom,\u201d following a series of incidents in which he talked about prosecuting his critics and casually threw around \u201ctreason\u201d accusations, believes someone else appears to be \u201chaving some kind of a breakdown.\u201d\n\nWhy? Because the president, lacking in self-awareness, thinks Schiff\u2019s comments \u201cbore no relationship\u201d to reality.\n\nI hope you caught Rachel\u2019s segment last night on the White House\u2019s linguistic campaign, featuring a president who thinks he can \u201cI\u2019m rubber, you\u2019re glue\u201d his way out of this.\n\n\u201cWhat we have already started living through here is an effort \u2026 to turn the behavior for which the president has now been caught, not just into some amorphous and unnecessarily complicated thing that doesn\u2019t really have any inherent meaning, but also to try to make his sins our sins. To try to absolve himself of his own crimes by putting what he did and \u2013 what he and his sort of henchmen in Ukraine have been doing \u2013 to try to put those crimes on everybody else\u2019s rap sheet. \u201cAnd I know it is hard to follow the twists and turns of the story as it continues to develop right now, but just heads up on this part of it. We are in the middle of them trying to redefine this whole thing, to try to make this simple case as messy as possible, and to try to make it seem like whatever the president did must have been done by his accusers first and worse. We\u2019ve seen them do this before with language and with the \u2018no puppet, no puppet, you\u2019re the puppet\u2019 argument. If it works against this impeachment thing, there\u2019s no grounds on which factually based accusations can ever be brought against this president. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work in this impeachment thing, we will have taken giant steps forward as a country part toward not being manipulated this way again the way we have so badly for the last three years.\u201d\n\nTrump has a playbook for defending himself and projection remains the first page.", "description": "\"I think he's having some kind of a breakdown,\" Donald Trump said yesterday about someone else.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_mj_first_191008_1570537011019.jpg?itok=SjfNEXvM", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
