Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe demonstrations in the special autonomous region, which until the mid-1990s was a British colony, have turned notably violent in recent days, as protesters seek to pressure the local government over its close ties to Beijing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response to Morey's statement, the Chinese Basketball Association suspended ties with the Rockets, despite the fact that Morey deleted his initial tweet. He also later issued a statement on Twitter, saying he did not intend \"to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China.\"\n\nThe NBA issued its own statement later on Sunday, saying it recognized that Morey's comments \"have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\"\n\n\"While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\"\n\nThe statement drew immediate backlash online, with journalists and U.S. lawmakers from both parties slamming it.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) was one of the first lawmakers to weigh in on the statement, calling it \"shameful.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s clear that the @NBA is more interested in money than human rights. Tonight\u2019s statement from Commissioner Silver is an absolute joke,\" he wrote, referring to Adam Silver.\n\n\"The NBA is kowtowing to Beijing to protect their bottom line and disavowing those with the temerity to #standwithHongKong.
