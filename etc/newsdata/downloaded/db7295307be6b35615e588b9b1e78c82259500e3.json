President Trump has not only gone after him as a traitor, he tried to strip his security clearance as a punitive action because this is such a terrible person,\" Maddow said of Brennan. \"The guy who was the Director of National Intelligence when the Russia investigation is opened has been denounced by President Trump and by the president's supporters.\n\n\"The whole framework of upper-echelon intelligence and law enforcement officials, Republican and Democrat and neither, especially the ones who had direct contact with this investigation or who were experts in Russian counter-intelligence or Russian-organized crime- they've all already been drummed out of the government and in many cases turned into household name villains by the president and his supporters.\"", "description": "MSNBC star Rachel Maddow was on the defensive Thursday night after multiple reports said the Justice Department investigation\u00a0into the origins of the Russia inquiry had shifted into a criminal probe.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
