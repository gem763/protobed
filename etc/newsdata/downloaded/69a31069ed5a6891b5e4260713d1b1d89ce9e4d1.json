Col. Alexander Vindman departs the Capitol on Tuesday night after a closed-door deposition. (Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nWith Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: President Trump tweeted this morning that \u201cjust a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one.\u201d He\u2019s referring to the rough transcript of his July 25 phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, which showed that Trump asked for a \u201cfavor\u201d from his counterpart in Kyiv. To see how \u201cperfectly appropriate\u201d he behaved, the president tweeted yesterday, \u201call anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT!\u201d On Oct. 2, Trump claimed that the document is \u201can exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation.\u201d\n\nBut we\u2019re learning new details that suggest what the White House put out was rougher than previously acknowledged. During more than 10 hours of testimony on Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman \u2013 the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council and the first witness in the House impeachment inquiry who actually heard the call \u2013 said that the rough transcript released by the White House does not include everything that transpired.\n\nThe Army officer, who earned the Purple Heart for valor during combat in Iraq, recalled Zelensky specifically referencing the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma by name when Trump pushed him to investigate a company related to Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Vindman also remembered Trump talking about how the former vice president was on tape boasting about Ukraine funds. This is most likely a reference to comments Biden made last year that the United States iced $1 billion in loan guarantees until the Ukrainian government fired a corrupt former prosecutor, per Karoun Demirjian and Greg Jaffe.\n\nEven if the filled-in gaps don\u2019t materially change our previous understanding of what took place, the revelation highlights just how much the public still does not know. As the investigation proceeds at what seems like a rapid pace, it\u2019s also an important reminder that official White House pronouncements should not be taken at face value.\n\n-- Vindman not only testified that the rough transcript omitted \u201ccrucial words and phrases,\u201d according to the New York Times, but he also said that his efforts to update the record of the call to reflect Trump\u2019s mentions of Burisma and Biden on tape failed: \u201cColonel Vindman did not testify to a motive behind the White House editing process \u2026 but the decision by a White House lawyer to quickly lock down the reconstructed transcript subverted the normal process of handling such documents \u2026The note-takers and voice recognition software used during the July 25 call had missed Mr. Zelensky saying the word \u2018Burisma,\u2019 according to people briefed on the matter, but the reconstructed transcript does refer to \u2018the company,\u2019 and suggests that the Ukrainian president is aware that it is of great interest to Mr. Trump. \u2026\n\n\u201cAfter the call, Colonel Vindman was given a hard copy of the rough transcript to make updates and corrections \u2026 Colonel Vindman went through the transcript, made changes and gave his written edits to his boss \u2026 After the call, Colonel Vindman went with his brother, a lawyer on the National Security Council staff, to see John A. Eisenberg, the council\u2019s legal adviser, to raise his concerns about the conversation. Colonel Vindman declined to detail to investigators his discussions with Mr. Eisenberg, citing attorney-client privilege\u2026\n\n\u201cOne explanation for why Colonel Vindman\u2019s changes were not made could be that the transcript had been quickly placed into a highly secure computer system, the N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment, or NICE system, making it more difficult to alter. Mr. Eisenberg ordered the transcript moved to ensure that people who were not assigned to handle Ukraine policy could not read the transcript, a decision he hoped would prevent gossip and leaks about the call. Putting the transcript in the secure server would have made it more difficult to make further edits to the document, and in the case of the July call effectively stopped additional changes. Mr. Eisenberg made the decision without consulting with his supervisor, Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel. A White House review of the handling of the call is examining if Mr. Eisenberg acted properly in securing the notes.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cOne of the Times\u2019 examples of how Vindman wanted to adjust the transcript contradicts what the White House said about the transcript when it was released,\u201d CNN notes. \u201cAsked in September why there were three ellipses, a senior White House official said they \u2018do not indicate missing words or phrases\u2019 but \u2018refer to a trailing off of a voice or pause. If there were missing words or phrases, they would be represented by brackets or redactions. This is the standard practice that is followed for all records of Presidential phone calls.\u2019 However, the Times reports that one of the changes to the transcript sought by Vindman was regarding replacing an ellipses: \u2018The rough transcript also contains ellipses at three points where Mr. Trump is speaking. Colonel Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden.\u2019\u201d\n\nNBC, the AP and BuzzFeed reported that they confirmed various elements of the Times reporting, including that Vindman tried to change the transcript to no avail.\n\n-- Flashback: The initial transcripts that Richard Nixon released of his conversations in the Oval Office were also incomplete. They didn\u2019t include the most incriminating material because the then-president edited it out.\n\n-- Vindman\u2019s testimony draws fresh attention to the White House\u2019s failure to release any rough transcript of Vice President Pence\u2019s conversation with Zelensky.\n\nCatherine Croft, a State Department adviser on Ukraine, arrives at the Capitol on Wedneday morning for closed-door testimony. (Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg)\n\n-- Sketchy backchanneling surrounding U.S. policy toward Ukraine long predates this summer. That\u2019s a big takeaway from the prepared remarks of two career diplomats who are testifying on the Hill today.\n\nChristopher Anderson, a career Foreign Service officer, will detail efforts when U.S. officials tried to demonstrate support for Ukraine only to be batted down by the White House, including after Russian forces attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels in the Sea of Azov in 2018. \u201cWhile my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued,\u201d Anderson planned to say.\n\nCatherine Croft, who worked on Ukraine issues at the White House and the State Department, will disclose that she received inexplicable phone calls from Washington lobbyist Robert Livingston, \u201cwho told me that Ambassador Yovanovitch should be fired,\u201d referring to Marie Yovanovitch, then the top U.S. envoy in Kyiv. \u201cHe characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 and associated with George Soros,\u201d she planned to say. Yovanovitch was recalled from her position at Trump\u2019s direction earlier this year after the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates made unsubstantiated allegations that she was opposed to Trump. \u201cIt was not clear to me at the time \u2014 or now \u2014 at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d Croft planned to say.\n\n\u201cCroft is expected to say she notified her boss, Fiona Hill, and another State Department official, George Kent, of Livingston\u2019s activities, and declare that she is \u2018not aware of any action that was taken in response,\u2019\u201d John Hudson and Elise Viebeck report. \u201cLivingston, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana, was chosen as the successor to Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House in 1999, but he declined the position after revelations of an extramarital affair. After leaving Congress, he formed the Livingston Group, one of Washington\u2019s most influential lobbying firms. His firm has represented clients in the Middle East and around the world, including political figures in Ukraine such as former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, according to Justice Department documents.\u201d\n\n-- Read Croft\u2019s opening statement here and Anderson\u2019s here.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, arrives on Wednesday for the closed-door deposition of Catherine Croft. (Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg)\n\n-- It\u2019s also important to emphasize that Vindman\u2019s concerns were broader than the July 25 call. Greg Miller looks into two White House meetings on July 10 with Ukrainian officials that have become central to the impeachment inquiry: \u201cOne of the officials Trump had entrusted to pursue this agenda, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, was undeterred by the fierce opposition from [John] Bolton and others. He persisted in pressing Ukraine to commit to Trump\u2019s demands, convening a second meeting even after a spectacular blowup in the West Wing. \u2026 After seeing Sondland outline political demands that Trump would reiterate in his July 25 call, Vindman said, he became worried that what he had witnessed was improper \u2026\n\n\u201cSondland has testified that he didn\u2019t know of any Biden connection in Trump\u2019s demands for a Burisma investigation until much later, after the allegations in the whistleblower complaint became known. He has also said that no White House officials ever expressed any concern to him about his efforts to push Ukraine to commit to the Burisma probe. His lawyer declined to comment Tuesday after the release of Vindman\u2019s opening statement. Sondland\u2019s account is contradicted by statements from Hill and Vindman. Hill testified that she entered the Ward Room as the follow-up meeting was already underway and heard Sondland say the word \u2018Burisma\u2019 as he resumed pressing the Ukrainians to pursue certain investigations. She then ordered that meeting to an immediate close.\n\n\u201cVindman said that Sondland used the downstairs meeting to press for \u2018investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma.\u2019 Vindman said he then confronted Sondland, saying that \u2018his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the [National Security Council] was going to get involved in or push.\u2019\u201d (The Fix created a Trump-Ukraine timeline to help keep straight what we\u2019ve learned.)\n\n-- \u201cIt\u2019s become a case of he said, they said\u201d is how the Wall Street Journal puts it: Vindman and Hill, in addition to acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, have all contradicted to varying degrees what Sondland told investigators.\n\nWHIPPING TOMORROW\u2019S VOTE:\n\n-- House Democrats unveiled the new procedures for the impeachment inquiry that they plan to vote on Thursday. Mike DeBonis reports: \u201cThe resolution backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hands the lead role to the House Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who would have broad latitude to organize extended questioning of potential public witnesses. Two other committees that have so far participated in the closed-door investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine \u2014 Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform \u2014 would not be permitted to directly participate in the open proceedings under the legislation. It also sets out for the first time the ability of House Republicans to make their own requests for testimony and documents, though those requests will be subject to a vote of the Democratic-majority committee \u2014 a practice that matches the minority powers in the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe House Rules Committee will debate and potentially amend the measure at a panel meeting Wednesday afternoon. \u2026 By confining the public hearings to the Intelligence Committee and excluding the other two panels that have participated in the closed-door interviews, Democrats are in effect sidelining several of the GOP\u2019s most aggressive and outspoken defenders of Trump. They include Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Mark Meadows (N.C.), who serve on the Oversight panel, as well as Rep. Lee Zeldin (N.Y.) of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who have led the public pushback to the Democratic impeachment effort in the House.\u201d (Read the draft of the resolution and the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s draft procedures.)\n\n-- Pelosi expects all but a handful of her Democratic members to support the resolution. One holdout is Rep. Jeff Van Drew (D-N.J.). \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen in my mind, it\u2019s going to happen here in the House; it will go over to the Senate, and then he will believe that he has been exonerated,\u201d Van Drew told reporters. \u201cHe will still be the president, and he will still be the candidate \u2014 a candidate who has been exonerated by the Senate.\u201d\n\n-- The latest on timing: House Democrats increasingly expect their effort to stretch well past Thanksgiving, possibly forcing a Senate trial into January or later. Michael Scherer and DeBonis report: \u201cHouse leaders had initially hoped to hold a floor vote before the Nov. 28 holiday so the Senate could hold trial before Christmas. But the surprising number of witnesses agreeing to testify behind closed doors \u2026 over the past few weeks has extended the timeline and sparked a debate over whether prolonged impeachment proceedings are politically prudent. \u2026 A January trial would also disrupt the final weeks of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses for candidates who are senators in Washington. \u2026 The caucuses are Feb. 3.\u201d\n\n-- The timing depends, in part, on how quickly the courts move: The Justice Department got a reprieve yesterday afternoon when a federal appeals court said the Trump administration does not have to immediately release to the House Judiciary Committee certain grand jury materials from Bob Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cThe court order means the issue will not be resolved before Nov. 5, when the final filing from the parties is due,\u201d Ann Marimow reports. \u201cThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was responding to an emergency request from the Justice Department, which said in a court filing that it would be \u2018irreparably harmed\u2019 without a stay and that \u2018once the information is disclosed, it cannot be recalled and the confidentiality of the grand jury information will be lost for all time.\u2019 A three-judge panel paused the order pending further review but made clear it was not deciding the merits of the case.\u201d (Read the court\u2019s order.)\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- The Nationals beat the Astros, 7-2, to force a decisive Game 7 of the World Series in Houston tonight.

(Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- An Islamic State defector inside Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s hideout was critical to the success of the raid against the ISIS leader, U.S. officials said. Joby Warrick, Ellen Nakashima and Dan Lamothe report: \u201cThe mole\u2019s detailed knowledge of Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts as well as the room-by-room layout of his sanctuary proved to be critical in the Oct. 26 raid that ended with the death of the world\u2019s most-wanted terrorist, the officials said. The informant was present during the assault on Baghdadi\u2019s compound in the Syrian province of Idlib, and he was exfiltrated from the region two days later with his family. The man, whose nationality had not been revealed, is expected to receive some or all of the $25 million U.S. bounty that had been placed on Baghdadi\u2019s head, according to the officials. One official said he was a Sunni Arab who turned against the Islamic State because one of his relatives had been killed by the group. The Islamic State defector had been cultivated as an asset by the Syrian Democratic Forces.\u201d\n\n-- Out of the loop: \u201cActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney first learned about the U.S. military raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after the operation was already underway,\u201d NBC News reports. \u201cThe extraordinary move by Trump to leave his chief of staff out of the most significant U.S. military operation against the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist since the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011 represents a major blow to Mulvaney, suggesting that he is increasingly sidelined inside the White House. The White House chief of staff typically would be central to such a momentous gambit for a president, coordinating logistics, public statements and notifications of congressional leaders and allies. Bill Daley, who was White House chief of staff during the bin Laden raid, was seated next to then-President Barack Obama as he monitored the raid ... Andrew Card, former President George W. Bush\u2019s longtime chief of staff, said the exclusion of Mulvaney from a moment of such magnitude in the presidency is difficult to grasp \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m baffled by it,\u2019 Card said. \u2018It\u2019s hard for me to imagine.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Dread descended upon Syria during the final hours of the cease-fire as American troops withdrew. Louisa Loveluck reports: \u201cIn towns and cities, families debated, and sometimes fought, over whether, and where, to run. Selling their houses to pay for the help of unpredictable smugglers was one option. Moving closer to the Iraqi border, where thousands of refugees had already crossed, and then praying the violence wouldn\u2019t follow, was another. \u2026 While U.S. troops withdrew to the south and out of the area where they\u2019d long kept the peace, Russian military police moved in. Under an agreement reached last week between Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Russian forces would now patrol the border. At times, American and Russian armored vehicles passed on the road, each with their own red, white and blue flags flapping in the wind.\u201d\n\n-- Prime Minister Boris Johnson finally won support from lawmakers for an early election, setting up a December vote that will be dominated by Brexit. Karla Adam and William Booth report: \u201cParliament will dissolve next week, and the parties will go into overdrive on their five-week campaigns. This will be the United Kingdom\u2019s first election in dark and dreary December since 1923 \u2014 a time of year when Britons prefer Christmas parties to political party hustings. Voters will be offered some stark choices on Brexit, alongside the usual overenthusiastic promises, scary scenarios, misrepresentations and foggy numbers. Will the British double down on wanting to leave the European Union? Or will they change their minds and decide to stay in the largest trading club on the planet?\u201d\n\n-- The House voted overwhelmingly to recognize the \"genocide\" of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, a damning rebuke of Turkey in the wake of its invasion of Syria. From the AP: \u201cHistorians estimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed around World War I, and many scholars see it as the 20th century\u2019s first genocide. Turkey disputes the description, saying the toll has been inflated and considering those killed victims of a civil war. The nonbinding resolution passed 405-11 Tuesday. American lawmakers have been critical of Ankara\u2019s recent incursion against the Kurds along the Turkish-Syrian border.\u201d\n\n-- Chilling: The messaging service WhatsApp filed suit in federal court against the Israeli surveillance company NSO, claiming it acted illegally in helping governments hack into the mobile devices of more than 100 people worldwide, including journalists, human rights workers and women who had been the subject of online attacks. Targets, who also included religious figures and lawyers, were identified in 20 countries, according to the lawsuit. Craig Timberg and Jay Greene have more details: \u201cThe suit amounted to a new legal front in attempts to curb the abuses of the burgeoning but almost entirely unregulated global surveillance industry. Victims of hacking previously have sued NSO in Israeli courts, but a technology company has not before pursued such legal action for using its services to help conduct spying operations on users.\n\n\u201cWhatsApp alleged that NSO helped government agencies deliver malicious software through seemingly harmless WhatsApp video calls, even if the targets never answered their phones. The malware was capable of initiating a powerful form of spying that included the ability to intercept communications, steal photos and other forms of data, activate microphones and cameras, track the locations of targets and more \u2026 An NSO surveillance tool called Pegasus has been implicated in spying on Washington Post contributing writer Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed by people affiliated with Saudi Arabia\u2019s security services last year. A friend of Khashoggi, Omar Abdulaziz, has alleged in a lawsuit that his phone was infected with Pegasus without his knowledge and that the malicious software helped the Saudis snoop on Khashoggi.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp says in a blog post that the company, which is owned by Facebook, believes NSO violated U.S. and California law, as well as the terms of service for WhatsApp. \u201cAt WhatsApp, we believe people have a fundamental right to privacy and that no one else should have access to your private conversations, not even us,\u201d writes Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, in an op-ed for The Post. NSO rejected the allegations in the lawsuit, saying its technology is used by governments and law enforcement to fight terrorism. \u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them,\u201d the Israeli company said in a statement forwarded by a Washington public relations agency.\n\n-- Scientists tripled their estimates of the number of people threatened by rising seas. Chris Mooney reports: \u201cThe upshot of the study is that 110 million people worldwide live below the high-tide level \u2014 including many partly protected by sea walls or other infrastructure, as in New Orleans. Even under a scenario of very modest climate change, that number will rise to 150 million in 2050 and 190 million by 2100. If climate change and sea level rise follow a worse path, as many as 340 million people living below the high-tide level could be in peril, to say nothing of how many could be affected by floods and extreme events.\u201d\n\n-- Climate activist Greta Thunberg declined the 2019 Nordic Council Environment Prize, saying the world needs more action on climate change and fewer awards.

(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Pay-to-play politics: \u201cPayday lenders discussed raising money for Trump\u2019s campaign to fend off regulation,\u201d by Renae Merle: \u201cBilling himself as one of President Trump\u2019s top fundraisers, Michael Hodges told fellow payday lenders recently that industry contributions to the president\u2019s reelection campaign could be leveraged to gain access to the Trump administration. \u2018Every dollar amount, no matter how small or large\u2019 \u2026 is important, Hodges, founder of Advance Financial, one of the country\u2019s largest payday lenders, said during a 48-minute webcast \u2026 \u2018For example, I\u2019ve gone to Ronna McDaniel and said, \u201cRonna, I need help on something,\u201d \u2019 Hodges said, referring to the chair of the Republican National Committee. \u2018She\u2019s been able to call over to the White House and say, \u201cHey, we have one of our large givers. They need an audience. \u2026 They need to be heard and you need to listen to them.\u201d So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important.\u2019 ...\n\n\u201cThe payday lending industry, made up of businesses that make short-term loans to consumers at high interest rates, is awaiting new rules that could weaken Obama administration requirements. \u2026 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) would pose a big threat if elected president, Hodges and three other industry insiders said during the talk. They called Trump their \u2018ultimate backstop\u2019 against attempts to defeat legislation the industry wants. \u2026Hodges said on the webinar that he has made [about $1.25 million] in campaign contributions to help Trump since 2016. \u2026 \u2018That is important to the campaign, which means it\u2019s important to the president, which means it\u2019s important if you ever had to call on anyone for anything in the administration,\u2019 he said during the call. \u2018That\u2019s how those things work.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe White House declined to comment for this report. Trump\u2019s reelection committee did not return a call for comment. In a statement, Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said: \u2018Part of the RNC\u2019s job is sharing what we hear from supporters across the country with party leaders. We often will connect our supporters with other Republican officials when they have a message they would like to pass along.\u2019\u201d Note that this is not a denial.\n\n-- Rep. Bradley Byrne (R), a leading candidate for Senate in Alabama, warned Jeff Sessions that he will not back out of the race if the former attorney general tries to reclaim his old seat. Seung Min Kim reports: \u201cBoth Byrne and Sessions draw their main base of political support from the Mobile area, triggering some speculation among insiders in the state that Byrne would bow out of the Senate race and run again for his old House seat if Sessions wages a bid. But Byrne said in an interview Tuesday that Sessions\u2019s entry would not make \u2018any difference to me\u2019 and vowed to stay in the race regardless. Then, unprompted, Byrne referenced what would almost certainly be Sessions\u2019s biggest political liability should he run again for the Senate. \u2018The president is very angry with Jeff. I think the president will be very vocal against him,\u2019 Byrne said. \u2018For Jeff\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t want that. But I think that\u2019s the reality of what he\u2019s facing.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- George Papadopoulos, the former Trump foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, plans to run for the House seat being vacated by Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.). Allyson Chiu reports: \u201cPapadopoulos, 32, filed paperwork to run as a Republican in California\u2019s 25th District and is expected to formally announce his candidacy later this week, Fox News reported. The news was met with swift backlash from California State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is so far the lone Democrat in the race for Hill\u2019s seat. Three Republicans are also running, the Associated Press reported.\"\n\n-- Bernie Sanders and Warren are in a close race among likely voters in New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic primary, according to a new CNN poll. Sanders pulls 21 percent, while Warren follows him at 18 percent, which is within the margin of error. Biden stands slightly behind at 15 percent, while Pete Buttigieg is the final candidate to reach double digits with 10 percent. Three candidates landed 5 percent in the poll \u2013 Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and businessman Andrew Yang. Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), who polled at 9 percent in a July New Hampshire poll, received just 3 percent support now. The poll shows that the race remains very fluid, and many people have not made up their minds.\n\n-- Biden\u2019s cash-strapped campaign is talking to top donors about ways to beef up fundraising in the next quarter. Ideas include spending more on social media platforms. From CNBC: \u201cPeople familiar with the campaign\u2019s deliberations say boosting online efforts doesn\u2019t necessarily represent a major shift in strategy. Yet several of Biden\u2019s fundraisers believe that the campaign needs to improve its appeal to online donors. \u2026 Biden\u2019s campaign has been behind in spending on Facebook ads that often entice contributors. Since he entered the race in April, Biden has spent $2.5 million on Facebook. Warren\u2019s campaign has spent $2.7 million and Sanders has bought $3.1 million in ads.\u201d\n\n-- Biden\u2019s campaign warned a newly formed super PAC not to attack the former vice president\u2019s Democratic competitors. \"Our campaign would be extremely frustrated if the super PAC was used to attack other Democrats,\" Biden's campaign manager Greg Schultz told reporters Tuesday, per CBS News.\n\n-- Sanders has gained key endorsements from some of the country\u2019s most powerful Latinas, leading some to believe that he might have a shot in capturing the Latinx vote, which has huge sway potential but low turnout numbers. From Politico: \u201cSanders' star support from prominent Latinas \u2018gives him barrio cred, street cred for this old white Jewish dude who is running for president,\u2019 said Domingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens. Garcia backed the Vermont senator in 2016 but, as president of LULAC, has refrained from endorsing a candidate in the current primary. \u2026 There\u2019s also the reality that Sanders probably can\u2019t win the Democratic nomination without Latinos, since his campaign is relying on a strong finish in states such as Nevada and California. Speaking to a crowd of hundreds of Latinos at a LULAC town hall in Iowa last week, Sanders received the loudest welcome of any presidential candidate in attendance, rousing the audience as he took the stage.\"\n\n-- Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (R) mocked Sanders and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib for speaking to reporters in front of empty shelves during a campaign stop. Walker said the backdrop looked like the \u201cempty shelves of grocery stores in many socialist countries.\" In reality, they were empty shelves at a Detroit food pantry for low-income families. From the Guardian: \u201cThe Rev Roslyn Bouier, the executive director of the Brightmoor Pantry, pointed out that the shelves were empty because of the overwhelming demand there is for food and water in Detroit. The pantry sees around 1,700 families a month. \u2018The pantry shelves are so empty because we are doing our job. Because people need the food. That shows the inhumanity. America needs to do better. That\u2019s the sadness of it.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The Bennet brothers \u2013 Michael, a senator running for president, and James, the editorial page editor at the New York Times \u2013 are struggling to figure out their place in an altered political landscape. Ben Terris profiles the duo: \u201cThe Bennets are the anti-Trump dynasty, institutionalists at a time when their very institutions \u2014 Capitol Hill, the mainstream media \u2014 have come under attack. To their critics on the left, they are mealy-mouthed centrists, focused on giving a platform to \u2018both sides,\u2019 for whom \u2018civility\u2019 is just another cudgel used by elites to cling to power. To their friends and supporters, they are what a politician and a newspaperman are supposed to look and act like, brothers in the mold of the Kennedys, idealists fighting for what\u2019s right. \u2018Are they dinosaurs or are they the future?\u2019 their lifelong friend Eric Kolodner said. \u2018I\u2019m worried that it\u2019s the former.\u2019\u201d\n\nWomen wearing Handmaid costumes protest in front of the Alabama state capitol in May. (Elijah Nouvelage for The Washington Post)\n\nIMPORTANT DOMESTIC STORIES THAT SHOULD BE ON YOUR RADAR:\n\n-- The U.S. economy cooled over the summer, growing at a 1.9 percent annualized pace from July through September, the latest sign that the slowdown is deepening. Heather Long and Andrew Van Dam report: \u201cThe data, released Wednesday morning by the Commerce Department, came as economists anticipated slightly weaker growth following Trump\u2019s decision to dramatically expand his trade war with China in early August. \u2026 Consumer spending continues to power the economy, but business investment has now contracted for six straight months, falling 3 percent in the third quarter, the biggest drop since the end of 2015. \u2026 Spending on both structures and equipment was deeply negative. \u2026 Slow growth abroad and problems at big employers such as Boeing and General Motors also were a drag on growth. \u2026 The Fed is widely expected to make a modest cut to interest rates at 2pm on Wednesday.\u201d\n\n-- A federal judge issued an injunction to block Alabama\u2019s near-total abortion ban from going into effect. Ariana Eunjung Cha and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux report: \u201cThe Alabama bill was tumultuous from the start, with an argument breaking out during one of its introductions. \u2026 Both sides reacted with similar passion on Tuesday to U.S. District Court in Middle Alabama Judge Myron H. Thompson\u2019s decision to issue an injunction against the law going into effect. \u2026 Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement that she signed it into law \u2018as a testament to Alabamians\u2019 long-standing belief that every human life is sacred\u2019 and said she is trusting the attorney general to do \u2018everything he can to challenge today\u2019s ruling and obtain a just result.\u2019 Amanda Reyes, executive director at Yellowhammer Fund, a grass-roots organization that helps low-income women pay for abortions, said that while she is relieved to learn that abortion will remain legal in Alabama, 'this changes nothing when it comes to the crisis marginalized communities have faced and will continue to face when it comes to accessing a termination.'\u201d\n\n-- The White House thinks it found a loophole that could allow Trump to ignore the clear intent of federal law so that he can choose someone to lead the Department of Homeland Security who could not get confirmed by the Senate. From the Times: \u201cAfter Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary \u2026 announced this month that he would resign, it was widely believed in the administration that Mr. Trump would tap someone who would not question his more extreme policies. \u2026 But officials leading agencies in homeland security who echo Mr. Trump\u2019s fiery language on immigration were initially deemed ineligible under the federal Vacancies Act. The law states that acting officials who take over cabinet-level positions must be next in the line of succession, have the approval of the Senate or have served 90 days under the previous secretary. The White House, however, is exploring a loophole in the law, according to an administration official. Under this route, the White House would tap someone to be the assistant secretary of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which is vacant, and then elevate that person to be the acting secretary of homeland security.\u201d\n\n-- No refugees will be resettled in the U.S. in October, leaving hundreds in limbo around the world. From CNN: \u201cA pause on admissions that was expected to lift on Tuesday will now extend into November, leaving those who expected to resettle in the US in limbo. It also means additional travel will need to be canceled and re-booked at the expense of federal taxpayers. The moratorium will run through November 5, according to a State Department spokesperson.\"\n\n-- The Trump administration is working to close immigration \u201cloopholes,\u201d but the border still remains \u201cin crisis,\u201d officials said. Robert Moore and Abigail Hauslohner report: \u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection agents took 970,000 people into custody along the southern border in the past year \u2014 more than double the previous year\u2019s total \u2014 including a \u2018record-breaking\u2019 number of families, CBP\u2019s acting commissioner Mark Morgan said. Border crossings in fiscal 2019 hit their highest number in more than a decade, despite a continuous drop in border crossings during the past four months, Morgan said. \u2026 Authorities credit the significant drop in border crossings in recent months to the administration\u2019s initiatives to close what Morgan called \u2018loopholes\u2019 in the immigration system \u2014 exceptions within U.S. law that officials say draw people to the country.\u201d\n\n-- PG&E\u2019s role in the Sonoma fire is being questioned as power outage frustrations mount across California. Douglas MacMillan and Faiz Siddiqui report: \u201cThe fires have deepened the sense of frustration felt by local residents and politicians as California\u2019s largest utility company embarks on an unprecedented schedule of forced blackouts. Buried in a contentious bankruptcy proceeding, unable to pay victims of past fires and preparing for the danger of hurricane-like winds, PG&E tried to stave off more damage and future liability by turning off power to more than 2 million customers. PG&E serves about 16 million customers over 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California. The blackouts may have helped contain the destruction; as of Tuesday, no deaths had been reported in connection to the fires, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. But the blowback from residents who have been forced to live on generators and batteries, and the growing concern that the power shut-offs have failed to prevent the exact problem they were designed to solve, have plunged PG&E into deeper political and financial crisis.\u201d\n\n-- Another windstorm will likely complicate the battle against Northern California\u2019s Kincade Fire. Derek Hawkins, Marisa Iati and Andrew Freedman report: \u201cThe National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for parts of Sonoma and Napa counties between noon Tuesday and 11 a.m. Wednesday, with the most powerful gusts expected during the overnight hours. \u2026 The Kincade Fire grew by about 700 acres on Tuesday. At 76,138 acres total \u2014 an area more than twice the size of San Francisco \u2014 it is already California\u2019s biggest fire of the year. The inferno was 15 percent contained, and officials said they expected it to burn until at least Nov. 7. At the same time, conditions in Southern California, where the Getty Fire scorched the western edge of Los Angeles on Monday, were expected to be even more dangerous.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nStephen Strasburg was one of the heroes of the Nationals win in Game 6, which prompted an old Trump tweet to recirculate:\n\nHOW CAN THERE BE A TWEET FOR EVERYTHING.....! https://t.co/RKvME1lYnY \u2014 Richard Deitsch (@richarddeitsch) October 30, 2019\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 loyalty to Strasburg finally paid off:\n\nNats are rewarded 7 years later for doing the right thing for Stephen Strasburg, 5-0 this postseason and the likely MVP if they win.

A heartbreaking and infuriating era. \u2014 Jay Nordlinger (@jaynordlinger) October 29, 2019\n\nWhile some conservatives hung on the fact that Vindman was born outside of the U.S. as evidence that he couldn't be loyal to the country, a former Clinton White House press secretary pointed out that one of the president's most outspoken boosters, Sebastian Gorka, wasn't born in the U.S. either.
