Climate Action Summit in New York City, dropping in for a session in the United Nations General Assembly and surprising many of the attendees before heading off to meetings with other world leaders.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the summit\u2019s host, described Trump\u2019s unannounced attendance as a \u201cstep forward,\u201d while Michael Bloomberg, who sat on a panel about achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, also thanked Trump for showing up.\n\n\u201cHopefully our conversations here today will be helpful to you as you make climate policy,\u201d Bloomberg said, drawing applause and laughter from the guests in the hall.\n\nTrump has described climate change as a \u201choax,\u201d and, in 2017, pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement that seeks to lower carbon emissions.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said countries \u201cmust honor our commitments and follow through on the Paris Agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal of certain parties will not shake the collective goal of the world community,\u201d Wang said.\n\nAfter departing the summit, Trump told reporters he is \u201ca big believer in clean air and clean water, and all countries should get together and do that, and they should do it for themselves.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump at the United Nations Climate Action Summit.

I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say you hear us and understand the urgency, but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.\u201d\n\nThe teenager was among 16 children to file a legal complaint with the United Nations on Monday, accusing five countries \u2014 France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, and Turkey \u2014 of not doing enough to combat climate change.\n\nLast week, she testified on Capitol Hill, urging lawmakers to \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d who say climate change is real and that humans are responsible \u2014 conclusions that Trump has resisted.\n\nAhead of the summit, leading climate scientists issued a report, United in Science, stating \u201cthat accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather were to blame for the record as the global average temperature increased by 1.1\u00b0C above pre-industrial (1850-1900) times.\u201d Their findings amplified last year\u2019s U.N. report, warning that the world has until 2030 to cut carbon pollution to avoid the worst effects of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C, such as rising ocean levels, devastating storms. Some consequences are already being felt.\n\nThe summit, which kicked off with an immersive experience produced by RYOT, a Verizon Media company, \u201cto emphasize the immediacy of fighting climate change.\u201d It featured about 60 heads of state, diplomats and business leaders who spoke about their efforts to reduce emissions to essentially zero by 2050. (Verizon Media is also the parent company of Yahoo News.)\n\nGuterres declared in his opening remarks that the \u201cticket to entry\u201d for the summit was not \u201ca beautiful speech, but concrete action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a climate talk summit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had enough talk. This is not a climate negotiation summit. You don\u2019t negotiate with nature. This is a climate action summit.\u201d", "description": "The Swedish teenager delivers a blistering critique of countries like the United States for not addressing climate change.", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bXMmRCvIYPhXxS.hh5n_gg--~B/aD0xMTA0O3c9MTY1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/67505300-de53-11e9-af3f-f17d8075605e", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
