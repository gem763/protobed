House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) took the impeachment inquiry away from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who claimed in July he was running one, and gave it to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA).\n\nSchiff has decided to conduct the impeachment inquiry in a secret room known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) meant for discussing and viewing classified materials, even though the interviews with witnesses are not classified.\n\nRepublicans say Schiff has explicitly instructed that classified information is not discussed during the interviews.\n\nOn Wednesday, more than two dozen Republican members of Congress stormed the SCIF to demand that they be allowed access to the impeachment inquiry that could lead to impeachment of a president 63 million Americans voted for.\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019 @Kristina_Wong.", "description": "Zeldin, who has attended every single deposition in the impeachment inquiry, said thus far, there is nothing to impeach Trump for.", "authors": ["Kristina Wong"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Shifty-Eyed-Shift-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
