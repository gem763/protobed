REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo\n\nThe German post and logistics group has been trying to boost profits by restructuring and hiking prices after missing targets in 2018, allowing it to lift its forecast for 2019 in August despite global trade tensions.\n\nWhile letter shipments are in long-term decline, Deutsche Post has enjoyed a boom in parcel volumes thanks to the rapid growth of ecommerce, but costs have risen due to a tight labor market and higher German tolls on trucks.\n\nLaying out its strategy for the next five years, the partially state-owned group confirmed its guidance for an operating profit of 5 billion euros in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe need not reinvent ourselves. We will digitalize,\u201d said Chief Executive Frank Appel.\n\nDeutsche Post shares fell slightly on Tuesday morning to trade 0.5% lower at 0751 GMT, underperforming Germany\u2019s bluechip Dax index which was up 0.4%.\n\n\u201cThis looks like evolution, not revolution,\u201d said Bernstein analysts Daniel Roeska and Alex Irving, adding that the most ambitious targets were for the freight forwarding business.\n\nGiven the current uncertain economic environment, finance chief Melanie Kreis said the company\u2019s new guidance would cover a three-year period and be rolled forward annually.\n\nU.S. rival FedEx Corp warned last month that full-year earnings would miss analysts\u2019 estimates, as the U.S.-China trade war exacerbates a global economic cooling.\n\nFor the 2020-2022 period, Deutsche Post plans to invest between 8.5 and 9.5 billion euros as it overhauls its IT systems and retrains staff, applying data analytics to help it better plan delivery routes and predict parcel volumes.\n\nIncluded in that figure will be 2 billion euros for digitalization, with the expectation that this spending will generate an annual benefit of more than 1.5 billion euros by 2025.\n\nThe new strategy is based on the assumption that air freight will grow 1-3% a year, ocean freight 2-4% and road freight 3-4%.", "description": "Deutsche Post DHL set a new target for an operating profit of 5.3 billion euros ($5.77 billion) for 2022 and said it would invest heavily in areas like warehouse automation and analytics as it seeks to keep up with fast-growing ecommerce.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435769928&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901ZO", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
