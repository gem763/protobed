That has denied oxygen to nationalist parties, which have remained tiny and on the political fringe.\n\nImmigration is not even an election issue. That may be because the European Union\u2019s migrant surge has largely bypassed Portugal.\n\nHundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants have crossed the Mediterranean from North Africa to southern Europe, triggering a backlash in Italy and Spain. Portugal doesn\u2019t lie on those geographic routes, and as one of western Europe\u2019s financially poorest countries its appeal to migrants is muted.\n\nThe number of asylum-seekers in Germany and France, together numbering more than 300,000 last year, dwarf Portugal\u2019s total, which barely reached four figures.\n\nIf migration reached a similar scale in Portugal, the Portuguese could swiftly change their attitude, says Antonio Costa Pinto, a professor at Lisbon University\u2019s Social Sciences Institute.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing making Portugal immune\u201d to migrant controversies, he said.\n\nFor now, though, the outlook is calm. Costa Pinto sees three reasons for Portugal\u2019s lack of friction with migrants.\n\nBesides the fact that there are few of them on Portuguese streets, many arrivals are Portuguese-speaking migrants from Brazil and the country\u2019s five former colonies in Africa, and that eases their integration.\n\nAlso, over the last 50 years the Portuguese have emigrated in droves, making them sensitive to how migrants are treated.\n\nSerenah Sabat, a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum-seeker from Bethlehem, doesn\u2019t need to be told that.\n\nShe is the co-manager of Mezze, a restaurant at Lisbon\u2019s Arroios market serving Middle eastern dishes, where 16 refugees work, most of them from Syria.\n\nSabat says she is \u201castonished\u201d by the welcome she has received over the past three years, comparing it favorably to her previous experiences in Belgium.\n\nShe sees an economic quid pro quo in immigration, saying Portugal should aim to attract more migrants \u201cto nourish the economy, because you need it, they need it.\u201d\n\nThat need is not lost on Antonio Costa, the Socialist prime minister for the last four years who is seeking re-election.\n\nCosta says one of his first legislative proposals if re-elected will be to make immigration easier, scrapping a quota system enacted by a previous Social Democrat government that linked migrant entries to labor market requirements.\n\nCosta says his plan is business-friendly: companies complain to him that they are short of unskilled workers, he says.\n\nPortugal \u201cneeds immigrants and more foreigners to do the work,\u201d Costa says, especially in construction and tourism.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the immigrants-stealing-our-jobs cry heard elsewhere in the European Union.\n\nSocial Democrat leader Rui Rio is more cautious. He insists on finding a balance between an open-door policy and the country\u2019s needs.\n\nThe underlying problem is Portugal\u2019s low birth rate, which threatens the financing of the welfare system as the population ages. At current fertility rates Portugal\u2019s population will decline from 10.3 million this year to 6.6 million in 2100, the EU predicts.\n\nMigration can offset that problem, which the Socialists say they will make it a policy priority.\n\nCosta\u2019s embrace of migrants hasn\u2019t hurt his re-election chances, judging by the polls.\n\nHis trump card remains the economy, however, which Costa Pinto, the Lisbon University professor, describes as delivering a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d for a politician seeking re-election.\n\nEconomic growth has climbed under the Socialists, from 0.19% in 2014 to 2.1% in 2018, while unemployment has fallen by half to around 6%.\n\nWith protest votes in Portugal traditionally going to fuel the abstention rate _ turnout at the last election in 2015 was a new record low of 57% _ rather than radical fringe parties, it won\u2019t be an anti-migrant vote that loses the ballot for Costa.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say there\u2019s no racism or xenophobia. They exist everywhere,\u201d says Hugo Vaz, a 33-year-old cinema technician sitting at a table at Mezze. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we should take in more migrants, but all EU countries should take in their fair share.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No loud populists, no surging far-right groups, a liberal and migrant-welcoming Socialist Party tipped for a resounding win _ Portugal's general election this weekend makes the country look like Europe's odd man out.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Hatton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/portugal_election_63044_c0-241-5760-3599_s1770x1032.jpg?5744a6e428d626295d3fe14d6d300f488e16a9a8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
