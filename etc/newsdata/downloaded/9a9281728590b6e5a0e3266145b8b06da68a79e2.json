Johnson says he wants a deal but insists there can be no delay to Brexit beyond Oct. 31.\n\nThe cool reception from Brussels to Johnson\u2019s proposal indicates just how far apart the two sides are on the first departure of a sovereign state from the EU project, which was forged from Europe\u2019s ruins after World War Two.\n\nA European Parliament Brexit group believes that Johnson\u2019s proposals \u201cdo not represent a basis for an agreement\u201d, according to the draft of a statement seen by Reuters ahead of release later in the day.\n\nSeparately, a senior EU official said Johnson\u2019s proposal \u201ccan\u2019t fly\u201d, largely because it did not offer a solution for the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland once the UK province has left the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\n\u201cIt does not contain any decent solution for customs. And it erects a hard border on the island of Ireland,\u201d said the senior EU official.\n\n\u201cIt would have to be fundamentally reworked,\u201d an EU diplomat said, adding that time was short before the bloc\u2019s leaders meet in Brussels in two weeks for a make-or-break Brexit summit on Oct. 17-18.\n\nIn Dublin, which is crucial to any deal, Junior Finance Minister Patrick O\u2019Donovan said Johnson\u2019s offer was the basis for discussions but not of an agreement.\n\nJohnson made what he said was his final Brexit pitch to the EU on Wednesday, offering a possible compromise on the Irish border that initially drew a cautious welcome by the EU.\n\nJohnson went further than many expected on the most contentious issue - the border between British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - with a proposal for an all-island regulatory zone to cover all goods, replacing the so-called backstop arrangement he says he cannot accept.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gives a closing speech at the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nBesides the concession, however, Johnson proposed giving Northern Ireland institutions the ongoing power to abide by or exit the regulatory zone - a possible step too far for Ireland and the EU.\n\n\u201cCREATIVE AND FLEXIBLE\u201d\n\nBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said it was now up to the bloc to help avert a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cIt is now for the EU to respond and also show they can be creative and flexible. This sets out the broad landing zone,\u201d he said on Thursday, adding that London was prepared to negotiate the details.\n\nWhen asked if there was enough time to deliver a Brexit deal, Barclay said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want an extension and we do believe there is enough time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are focused on getting a deal because we think this is the best way forward,\u201d Barclay said. \u201cThese are serious proposals and clearly we need to have a negotiation with the EU on taking them forward.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nJohnson says he wants to strike a deal at an Oct. 17-18 EU summit. A law passed by his opponents in parliament forces him to delay Brexit unless he strikes a deal, but Johnson has said further delay is \u201cpointless and expensive\u201d.\n\nAmid so much pessimism about the possibility of a deal in just weeks, many diplomats say a phoney struggle is underway between London and Brussels to apportion blame.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson's last ditch Brexit proposal \"can't fly\" because it an unworkable move backwards that leaves Britain and the European Union far apart, a senior European Union official said on Thursday.", "authors": ["John Chalmers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436567203&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920JS"}
