It receives business proposals\n\nfrequently but acquisitions are more often stumbled upon during\n\none of Chairman's Tony Tan Caktiong long food tasting trips than\n\nsought out through bankers.\n\n\"Most of the acquisitions resulted from Tan Caktiong eating\n\nin a restaurant, liking the food and asking 'who runs the\n\nplace?',\" said Erwin Elechicon, former chief of Jollibee's\n\ninternational operations.\n\nThat was the case with Tortas Frontera. Tan, also founder of\n\nthe company and brother of CEO Tanmantiong, had eaten one of its\n\nsandwiches at the airport.\n\nWhile noting they tend to buy small, Jollibee executives say\n\nthey are open to any type of acquisition if the food is good.\n\nBut they acknowledge their immediate focus is on turning\n\naround Smashburger and Coffee Bean - both loss-making and bigger\n\nthan Jollibee's usual acquisitions with $210 million spent on\n\nSmashburger and Coffee Bean costing $350 million including debt.\n\nInvestor concerns that Jollibee is overextended were\n\nexacerbated by first-half profit sliding by a third to 2.66\n\nbillion pesos ($51 million) due to losses at Smashburger and\n\ndeliveries problems with its Red Ribbon Bakeshop. Its stock has\n\nlost 18% since late July when it announced its purchase of\n\nCoffee Bean.\n\n\"It would be better for them not to do another acquisition\n\nat least of this scale until Smashburger and CBTL become\n\nprofitable,\" said Renzo Louie Candano, analyst at DBP-Daiwa\n\nCapital Markets in Manila.\n\nJollibee believes, however, that it has not overreached. Nor\n\nis it concerned that any of its targeted markets are saturated\n\nor that it might not be able to compete with the likes of\n\nStarbucks .\n\n\"Every restaurant in the Philippines has fried chicken, in\n\nVietnam there are maybe 10 coffee shops on every block. In the\n\nmidst of all of this competition, there's always a standout one\n\nor two,\" said Chief Financial Officer Ysmael Baysa.\n\n\"How are you going to do it? Our formula is very simple.\n\nOffer the best tasting food at the right price and you're going\n\nto make it.\"\n\nHe noted that Coffee Bean had a strong presence in Southeast\n\nAsia and the Middle East, regions where coffee culture still\n\nhas a lot of room to grow and that its Highlands Coffee stores\n\nin Vietnam logged revenue growth of around 32% last year.\n\nIt has also taken on big chains before.\n\nNot long after Jollibee, originally an ice cream parlour,\n\nstarted selling burgers in 1978, friends advised Tan Caktiong\n\nand his brothers to quit, warning the imminent arrival of U.S.\n\ngiant McDonald's MCD.N in Philippines would decimate\n\nJollibee's six branches.\n\nUndeterred, the firm took on McDonald's by surrounding each\n\nbig branch with smaller Jollibee outlets, and measuring the U.S\n\nfirm's sales by counting trash outside its branches. Since 1984,\n\nJollibee has outsold McDonald's domestically.\n\nOutside the Philippines, Jollibee restaurant locations tend\n\nto be in areas with large expat Filipino populations. But\n\nexecutives point to its growing popularity with non-Filipinos,\n\nparticularly in Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nIt also has big plans to expand the Jollibee chain in North\n\nAmerica, aiming for 150 U.S. stores and 100 in Canada over five\n\nyears, up from 37 and 4 respectively.\n\n($1 = 52.0400 Philippine pesos)\n\n\n\nJollibee: The little bee that could https://tmsnrt.rs/2zqOmGr\n\nJollibee and McDonald's in the Philippines https://tmsnrt.rs/2zsoz0H\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "Philippine fast food specialist Jollibee hungry to expand in U.S., China", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_5_800x533_L_1412601619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
