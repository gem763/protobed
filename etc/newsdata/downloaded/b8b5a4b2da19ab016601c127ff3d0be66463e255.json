Indeed, how many leaders do we want to lose to it?'' he said.\n\nMr Taylor said \"we would love Labor to support our policy''.\n\n\"They are clearly recognising the error of their ways.''\n\nBut shadow climate and energy minister Mark Butler slapped down Mr Fitzgibbon's idea, telling Guardian Australia it would be inconsistent with the Paris agreement.\n\n\"It would lead to global warming of more than 3 degrees and, for that reason, Labor cannot support that target. That has been a consistent position of ours since we first took advice about what Tony Abbott\u2019s target would mean for climate change,'' he said.\n\nAsked at the Summit about Mr Fitzgibbon\u2019s idea, Victorian Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change Lily D'Ambrosio said she had no idea what motivated him to call for a reduction in the target.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not particularly interested in what a federal opposition does,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe have a very strong and ambitious policy and we took that to the last state election and, we all know the result of that election, so we will continue to implement our policies and get them done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ms D\u2019Ambrosio, Victoria\u2019s ambitious policies are providing the investor certainty not found in other states, which is why it has attracted 43 per cent of the nation\u2019s total new energy project investment.\n\nShe said the energy market had reached a point that it needed more intervention from all governments and that the energy debate should not be seen through an ideological prism.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t simply protect existing interests,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe current rules are designed for a different era but the energy market operator seems to just back the status quo. Every day we spend waiting is another day that the issues of reliability, security and affordability become more acute.\u201d\n\nMs D\u2019Ambrosio said it had been a year since state and federal energy ministers last met, with the next Council of Australian Government energy council meeting scheduled for late next month.\n\n\"For me, November 22 cannot come fast enough,\" she said.\n\nMs D\u2019Ambrosio said Labor in Victoria wants to work with the Commonwealth to secure more energy supply and build a transmission network of the future. But the federal government must first create a system that provides the right combination of investment and rule changes to ensure the nation\u2019s future energy readiness.\n\nShe also said the Victorian government\u2019s ban on fracking will stay in place while the science \u201cis still out\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are very clear on our policy decision around fracking as we don\u2019t believe there is sufficient confidence in the science to give farmers the certainty they need (about) what the impact will be on water supply.\u201d\n\nShe said she could not see the pressing need to access Victoria\u2019s unconventional gas reserves because Australia had sufficient gas but allowed \u201ctoo much of it to be exported\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has the mechanisms and authority to tackle the challenge of domestic gas shortages but it needs to consider the amount of gas allowed to be exported so there are sufficient supplies available domestically,\u201d she said.", "description": "ALP frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon's comments on emissions targets suggest the federal opposition might be in search of a new climate policy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_95/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6d5f5b1508e424858563e0e525aaab3e5cc04c5b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
