But an export bar was placed on it by the government in the hope a UK buyer would match the price to keep in the country.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A news picture from 1960, purporting to show London \u2018office girls\u2019 buying copies of the book for their colleagues after the trial.

The jury took three hours to return a not guilty verdict for Penguin, with Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover going on to sell 2m copies in just two years.\n\nAfter a crowdfunding appeal from English Pen raised more than \u00a320,000, and Penguin Books and the TS Eliot estate donated a combined \u00a315,000, the University of Bristol has stepped forward to acquire the book. It is \u201cproactively seeking financial support from alumni and friends of the university to reach the rest of the total purchase price\u201d, and will house the book in its collections as part of the Penguin Archive.\n\n\u201cThis special book will be a source of inspiration, teaching and research for our staff, students and visitors, supporting the university\u2019s creative, scholarly and social outcomes for years to come,\u201d said deputy vice-chancellor, professor Judith Squires. \u201cIt will be a focal point in our new university library, which is planned to open in 2023/24, providing specialist research facilities, galleries and public event spaces.\u201d\n\nEnglish Pen president Philippe Sands said the free speech organisation was thrilled that the campaign had been successful. \u201cThe trial involving Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover was a seminal moment in the continuing struggle for freedom of expression, and the judge\u2019s copy belongs here in the UK, a singular reminder of the road travelled and remaining.\u201d\n\nGaiman, who was born the day after Lady Chatterley was made legal, said it was important that the book stayed in the UK. \u201cThat a crowd of people came together to contribute is proof that the internet is actually good for something,\u201d he said.", "description": "Book bearing notes from the judge\u2019s wife about \u2018coarse\u2019 content bought by Bristol University after a crowdfunding campaign", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bb12d954ae9562d2dbd50efa20242693b94426a/0_30_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=45e9fb45f7bb607165b481e80b13c46f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
