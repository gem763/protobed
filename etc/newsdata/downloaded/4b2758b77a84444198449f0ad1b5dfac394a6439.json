(Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)\n\nFacebook employees published an internal letter several weeks ago that criticizes CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to allow politicians and other public officials to purchase ads that include false information.\n\nQuoting former Facebook chief product officer turned critic Chris Cox, the employees make the case that Zuckerberg\u2019s prioritization of free speech will empower authoritarians, writing \u201cwe know the effects of social media are not neutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cFree speech and paid speech are not the same thing,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cMisinformation affects us all. Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for. We strongly object to this policy as it stands. It doesn\u2019t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times first reported Monday on the letter, which has circulated on Facebook Workplace, an internal company messaging platform, and has accrued over 250 signatures.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s culture is built on openness, so we appreciate our employees voicing their thoughts on this important topic,\u201d Bertie Thomson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain committed to not censoring political speech, and will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, Zuckerberg has mounted a public defense of adherence to free speech principles in response to the criticism that the platform should take a more pro-active role in censoring political disinformation.\n\n\u201cPeople worry, and I worry deeply, too, about an erosion of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg told the Washington Post earlier this month. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true. In general, in a democracy, I think that people should be able to hear for themselves what politicians are saying.\u201d\n\nThe letter proposes a number of improvements to the current policy, including holding political ads to the same criteria as standard ads while highlighting the difference between the two, restricting targeting by political ads, and spending caps for individuals who publish political ads.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of the work that the integrity teams have done, and we don\u2019t want to see that undermined by policy. Over the coming months, we\u2019ll continue this conversation, and we look forward to working towards solutions together. This is still our company,\u201d the letter closes.", "description": "Facebook employees published an internal letter several weeks ago that criticizes CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to allow ads with false information.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
