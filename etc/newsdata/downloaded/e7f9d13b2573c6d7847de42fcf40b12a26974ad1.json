But where Ms. Norman was concerned, he continued, \u201call of the cliches ring true: This gigantic woman with the gigantic voice is one of a kind. Posterity will envy us for having her in our midst.\u201d\n\nMs. Norman, one of the most celebrated opera singers of her era, with a repertoire that spanned the operatic canon from Wagner to Verdi and from Purcell to Poulenc, also venturing into jazz and African American spirituals, died Sept. 30 at a hospital in New York City. She was 74.\n\nThe cause was \u201cseptic shock and multi-organ failure secondary to complications of a spinal cord injury she had sustained in 2015,\u201d according to a family statement distributed by a spokeswoman, Gwendolyn Quinn.\n\nMs. Norman came of age in the Jim Crow South, one of five children in a middle-class African American family in Augusta, Ga. Hers was a musical household, where all the children took piano lessons, their mother sang as she went about her work and the radio was set on Saturday afternoons to the matinee broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\n\nMs. Norman established herself in Europe before making her Met debut as Cassandra in Berlioz\u2019s \u201cLes Troyens\u201d on opening night in 1983, opposite Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and under the baton of conductor James Levine. By the end of her career, even those uninitiated to the thrills of opera might have known her from her appearances on PBS and her performances at public events, including the second inaugurations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nIn this photograph taken on March 23, 1984, US soprano Jessye Ms. Norman performs in Purcell's \u201cDido and Aeneas\u201d at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris. (Philippe Wojazer/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nShe credited African American opera singers of earlier generations, including Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price and Mattiwilda Dobbs with opening the international stage to her.\n\n\u201cThey have made it possible for me to say, \u2018I will sing French opera\u2019 or \u2018I will sing German opera,\u2019 instead of being told, \u2018You will sing \u2018Porgy and Bess,\u2019 \u201d she told the New York Times in 1983.\n\nAt the same time, she said, \u201cit\u2019s unrealistic to pretend that racial prejudice doesn\u2019t exist. It does! It\u2019s one thing to have a set of laws, and quite another to change the hearts and minds of men. That takes longer. I do not consider my blackness a problem. I think it looks rather nice.\u201d\n\nRosalyn M. Story, the author of the volume \u201cAnd So I Sing: African-American Divas of Opera and Concert,\u201d said in an interview that black singers looked to Ms. Norman, with her \u201ctowering sense of self\u201d and majestic instrument, as \u201can exemplary figure.\u201d She described Ms. Norman\u2019s voice as complex, with the range of a soprano but the \u201cdark, warm quality\u201d often associated with mezzos. With only a note or two, Story said, Ms. Norman\u2019s voice was immediately recognizable.\n\nMs. Norman made dozens of appearances at the Met before her final performance there in 2002. In Europe, she performed in the continent\u2019s most celebrated opera houses, including La Scala in Milan, the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London, and the Paris Opera.\n\n\n\nMs. Norman sings in Versailles, outside Paris, in 1989. (Jean-Pierre Muller/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nShe excelled in the works of the German composers Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner, in Baroque operas such as Purcell\u2019s \u201cDido and Aeneas\u201d as well as modern works such as Poulenc\u2019s \u201cDialogues des Carm\u00e9lites\u201d and Jan\u00e1cek\u2019s \u201cThe Makropulos Case.\u201d She took on classic roles including Aida, Verdi\u2019s enslaved Ethio\u00adpian princess, and Bizet\u2019s gypsy Carmen. But she was not interested in \u201cso-called mainstream repertory,\u201d she told the Times.\n\n\u201cI have not become a Verdi heroine soprano and, of course, that\u2019s what\u2019s needed in opera houses. . . . To sing roles with which I have no empathy would be wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is, I adore the unusual.\u201d\n\nShe was widely admired as a recitalist, winning her first of four Grammy Awards in 1984 for a recording of the works of Maurice Ravel. (Her later awards honored her recordings of Wagner\u2019s \u201cLohengrin\u201d and \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d and Bart\u00f3k \u201cBluebeard\u2019s Castle.\u201d Ms. Norman also won a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2006.)\n\nEven as her voice diminished with age, she attracted adoring fans to her recitals, where, in what is often perceived as operatic tradition, she projected what many reviewers described as a regal presence.\n\nIn 1998, Anthony Tommasini, the Times opera critic, noted that she was the only prima donna he could \u201cthink of whose entrances in recital are followed by a spotlight.\u201d On the rare occasions when she granted interviews, she sometimes referred to herself in the first-person plural.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama bestowed on her the National Medal of Arts.\n\nMs. Norman was born Sept. 15, 1945, in Augusta, the daughter of an insurance salesman. She began singing at an early age, including at church, and entered her first vocal competition at 7. She took third prize, she told the Times, because she flubbed the second stanza of the hymn \u201cGod Will Take Care of You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess He has taken care of me,\u201d she quipped. \u201cThat was my last memory slip in public.\u201d\n\nShe received a scholarship to study at Howard University in Washington, where she received a bachelor\u2019s degree in music in 1967, then studied at the Peabody conservatory in Baltimore before receiving a master\u2019s degree in vocal performance from the University of Michigan in 1968.\n\nA turning point came that year, when she won the Munich International Music Competition and then debuted in West Berlin as Elisabeth in Wagner\u2019s \u201cTannh\u00e4user.\u201d Many aspiring American opera singers began their careers in Europe because of the greater appetite there for the art form. She soon attracted attention in the United States as well.\n\n\u201cThe voice always had the obvious makings of greatness,\u201d Alan M. Kriegsman wrote in The Post in 1972. \u201cIt is large, very large in amplitude, and its natural quality is so rich in timbre and texture that it takes only a few moments of listening to know one is dealing with an exceptional instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cMark the name well,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s apt to become as much a magnet here as on the other side of the Atlantic before too long.\u201d\n\nMs. Norman lived for a portion of her career in London and had an estate in Westchester County, N.Y. Her survivors include a sister and a brother.\n\nHer civic engagement included work on behalf of AIDS research, the Girl Scouts and music education for disadvantaged youths. She said that she wished to see more minority musicians on the opera and concert stages.\n\nIn her 2014 memoir, \u201cStand Up Straight and Sing!\u201d \u2014 the title was drawn from an admonition from her mother \u2014 Ms. Norman described herself as coming from \u201ca specific place and time in the history of our nation, in the Deep South, where our people marched, bled, and soldiered their way through the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery voice needed to find its own place,\u201d she wrote, \u201cits own platform from which the cry for freedom and equality could be heard.\u201d", "description": "She rose from her upbringing in the segregated South to become one of the most celebrated opera singers of her era.", "authors": ["Emily Langer", "Obituary Writer", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YaJ-Ycn-fL3STdhSsQP6CWLnPD4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O3E6K6HELII6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
