The White House subsequently released a rough transcript of a July phone call that triggered the complaint, and it showed Mr. Trump repeatedly asking his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that this impeachment process will help to bring this country, maybe counterintuitively, but it will bring this country together as we share the same facts and are on the same page \u2014 both about what the president has done and what the consequences of that must be,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said on SiriusXM\u2019s The Dean Obeidallah Show.\n\n\u201cAnd maybe like what happened in 1974 after Watergate, we will see some Republicans even come forward, and maybe even some willing to sit down with the president and tell him the the writing is on the wall, and the best thing he can do for this country, and really perhaps even for himself, is to step down,\u201d the former congressman continued. \u201cBut even if he were to do that, to answer your question, Dean, I don\u2019t think he should be immune from the consequences. Either removal from office, or criminal consequences after he has held office. I think that\u2019s incredibly important.\u201d\n\nCongress has only considered impeaching three other presidents in the past: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both impeached in the House but later acquitted in the Senate, while Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974 amid impeachment proceedings and was later granted a full and unconditional pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke, 47, was a member of the El Paso City Council prior to representing Texas\u2019s 16th District in Congress for six years. He unsuccessfully campaigned in 2018 for the seat year by Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, and subsequently launched his 2020 presidential campaign earlier this year.\n\nRecent nationwide polling has placed Mr. O\u2019Rourke among the top 10 candidates favored by Democratic voters to run in 2020 against Mr. Trump, albeit well behind current front-runners such as Mr. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernard Sanders. The results of polling released this week by Emerson College and Monmouth University placed his support among Democratic voters for 2% and 1%, respectively.\n\nAmericans are roughly split with respect to supporting the impeachment inquiry, meanwhile. The results of another poll released by Monmouth this week found that 44% of Americans want the president impeached and compelled to leave office, while 52% would prefer otherwise.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
