Participation in the electoral process in a situation where even the election rhetoric is to be dictated by the centre will only amount to legitimising the actions of the Indian govt in #Kashmir pic.twitter.com/7PMi2aIZdw \u2014 Shehla Rashid \u0634\u06c1\u0644\u0627 \u0631\u0634\u06cc\u062f (@Shehla_Rashid) October 9, 2019\n\nOn Wednesday, many of these candidates went to their villages for the first time to campaign in the closed-door meetings.\n\n\"This is really worth seeing how the democracy of India lives in hotels in Kashmir,\" said 30-year-old, Dilshad Ahmad. \"This is a forced election, we don't know what they plan to do here\".\n\nMany village heads have moved to the government-provided accommodations and hotels with their families due to fear from armed rebels. A Peoples Democratic Party activist in Anantnag was shot at on Sunday.\n\nAsiya, 34, is staying at a hotel in old Srinagar's Khanyar with her three children. Her husband, Abdul Rasheed, is a sarpanch [village head] from Khag village in Budgam and the family has been living in the hotel, 60km away from their home.\n\n\"There is a lot of fear. Today, he has gone to his village for the first time after August 5 and I am worried about him,\" she told Al Jazeera sitting in her hotel room.\n\nIn another hotel on the banks of Dal Lake in the main city of Srinagar, there are 18 village heads from Shopian and Anantnag and other villages from south Kashmir are staying for the last 20 days.\n\nGhulam Hasan Khan, who is contesting from Ichgam in central Kashmir, said his village lacks development.\n\n\"I want to make the local hospital run 24/7 and help build better roads,\" Khan said.\n\nWhen asked about the current situation in Kashmir, he declined to comment.\n\n'Democracy lives in hotels'\n\nThe ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has backed the abrogation of Article 370, is contesting the elections for the Block development Council (BDC) and is hoping for a major win.\n\n\"Till now, there has been no progress in the villages and now it is obvious we will take these villages towards more prosperity,\" Ashok Koul, BJP general secretary in Jammu and Kashmir, told Al Jazeera.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been killed since an armed rebellion erupted in late 1980s. The early 2000s saw a drop in violence but after 2014, when the BJP came to power, the region has descended into unrest.\n\n191021131415392\n\nGhulam Ahmad Mir, a former parliamentarian and a senior Congress leader from south Kashmir's Anantnag constituency accused the BJP of \"destroying the region\".\n\nMir questioned the election process as most party leaders are in jails or house arrested.\n\n\"This election is for the BJP, by the BJP and of the BJP. They [BJP] are forcing themselves on people in Kashmir. There is no democratic way,\" he said.\n\nThe government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed normalcy has been restored in the region but 80 days since the security lockdown was announced, internet shutdown continues, with some easing in phone communication.\n\nThe residents have launched a \"civil disobedience movement\" keeping the schools shut, public transport off the roads and a day-time shutdown of all shops in the region.\n\n\"Had schools been open, public transport been plying and political workers free. We might have called it an election, but when there are no indicators of normalcy. How can you say that fair election is going on,\" Mir told Al Jazeera.\n\nZubair Ahmad, 35, from Shopian said that there was no talk about the elections and people were unaware what was happening. He termed the polls as a \"futile exercise\".\n\n\"The government has installed these village heads and now they are making them move like a puppets. Any of these exercise has nothing to do with common people as our voices have already been crushed,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"People are worried about their children who have been tortured and jailed. Literally, no one knows about these elections which the government is giving too much hype to show things are normal here.\"", "description": "With hundreds of leaders in jail, regional parties are boycotting the local body elections as the siege enters 80th day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/7ceba8a8ec034603949cb30c05e6cb36_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
