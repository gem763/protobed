It just took a lot of time and growth to get to that place.\"\n\n(Image: Splash)\n\nThe performer shared that at first he struggled to see why people were offended by the lyrics, which were condemned for belittling sexual consent as he saw women sing and like the song - before realising that there are \"males who use that same language when taking advantage of women.\"\n\nSharing his epiphany, he added: \"It just matters how it affects women. And I was like 'Got it. I get it. Cool'.\n\n\"I realised that we live in a chauvinist culture in our country. I hadn't realised that. Didn't realise that some of my songs catered to that. So that blew my mind.\"\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\nThe candid interview comes after Robin and his collaborator Pharrell were hit with a $5million (\u00a34million) legal fine over their 2013 song Blurred Lines - after an appeals court ruled they had ripped off a much older track.\n\nThe singers were ordered to hand over cash and half of all their future royalties from the song to Marvin Gaye's family, after his relatives raised a copyright claim citing his 1977 hit Got To Give It Up.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThicke must cough up $1.7m (\u00a31.3m) by himself, while Williams and his publishing company More Water From Nazareth have been told to pay $357,630 (\u00a3282,296) - on top of the $2.8m (\u00a32.2m) in damages they must all pay to Marvin's relatives.\n\nIn addition, Gaye's family are now entitled to 50% of all further royalties from Blurred Lines.\n\nIt brought the total fine to $4.98m (\u00a33.9m), which is far less than the \u00a313million made by Williams and Thicke when their controversial song went viral.", "description": "The Blurred lines star has told how he would \"never write or sing today\" the lyrics that were in his and Robin Thicke's controversial song", "authors": ["Sara-Aisha Kent", "Image", "Splash", "Wireimage", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13507766.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Pharrell-Williams.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
