But now, with Boris Johnson victorious in Tuesday's leadership contest, journalist Sam Leith has gained entry to that illustrious club.\n\nLeith, then literary editor at The Daily Telegraph, commissioned and published a review of a Johnson biography that ridiculed the future prime minister as looking like he wore \u201ca urine-coloured fright wig\u201d and named his children. A \u201cvery cross\u201d Johnson then sent an email to Leith that, the writer recalled, said something along the lines of: \u201cI can\u2019t believe you had anything to do with commissioning or publishing this but if you did you can fuck off and die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote back saying that I\u2019d commissioned it in good faith and, as was usual, once a review\u2019s commissioned we publish without fear or favour,\u201d Leith explained to The Daily Beast. The journalist then signed off the email with: \u201cYours fucking off and dying.\u201d\n\nThe anecdote\u2014sure to make Leith a star attraction at dinner parties for at least the length of Johnson\u2019s tenure\u2014is just one example of Johnson\u2019s erratic behavior. He\u2019s prone to poorly considered outbursts, usually presented with a memorable turn of phrase, but also possesses the personal charm to end up back in the good graces of people he offends.\n\n\u201cI had a very gracious apology by return of email saying, basically: \u2018Sorry: I blew my top and shouldn\u2019t have,\u2019\u201d said Leith. \u201cI thought it was kind of a reckless email for a sitting MP to send a working journalist and it was a flash of the well-attested temper, but I bear no grudge at all about it and (whatever my thoughts on his suitability as PM) we\u2019ve generally got on well personally, so it was more like a temper tantrum than a giant falling-out.\u201d\n\nJohnson won the Conservative leadership election overwhelmingly. The results announced Tuesday morning showed that he won 66.4 percent compared to rival Jeremy Hunt's 33.6 percent. In a short speech following the announcement, Johnson admitted some will \u201cquestion the wisdom\u201d of the decision to make him prime minister.\n\nJohnson\u2019s premiership is not going to be boring, and not only because of the hellish ghost train that could come with his commitment to extracting Britain from the European Union, even if he fails to strike a new deal, by the October 31st deadline. Johnson has been one of the most controversial public figures in Britain for decades now\u2014a once-amusing oddity who has become less and less funny as he\u2019s inexplicably become more and more powerful.\n\nJohnson first became known in the British establishment as a journalist who was renowned for ludicrous exaggeration and fired for fabrication. Having failed at that, he was forced to lower himself to becoming a Conservative member of Parliament, where he thrilled a public tired of boringly competent politicians with his disheveled turns on television game shows. His celebrity rose to the point where he was elected London mayor before going on to lead the pro-Brexit campaign in the 2016 referendum\u2014a choice widely believed to have been borne out of a love of publicity and power rather than any deep-seated beliefs. Following a brief and utterly disastrous stint as foreign secretary, somehow he\u2019s stumbled into the most powerful office in the land.\n\nThe Daily Beast spoke to people who have worked with him over his colorful career. They largely split into two camps: those who think he\u2019s one of the most arrogant, lazy, and unpleasant men who they\u2019ve ever encountered; and those who he appears to have inspired great loyalty from who genuinely believe his strong personality is what\u2019s needed to see Britain through Brexit and reunite the Conservative party and the public.\n\nBen Rooney, one of Johnson\u2019s former colleagues at The Daily Telegraph, is very much in the former camp. Rooney\u2019s description of Johnson is typical, saying he is a \u201cconvivial, amusing, self-deprecating\u201d man, but one who has enormous flaws that make him appear to be an absolutely terrible candidate to be prime minister of a country which, despite its best efforts in recent years, remains one of the world\u2019s most powerful countries.\n\n\u201cMy overwhelming impression of Boris was a clever person pretending to be stupid, unlike most people who are stupid people pretending to be clever,\u201d said Rooney. \u201cGetting him to do work that he didn\u2019t want to do was difficult. He was absolutely uninterested in detail, so you had to check his copy carefully as it would be full of minor mistakes. The big-picture stuff he would get correct, but the detail was often sketchy at best. Names and dates would be wrong. You got the impression that he was simply remembering it, rather than researching.\u201d\n\nRooney stressed that his experience of Johnson was \u201ca long time ago\u2026 and we all change,\u201d but his description seems to be a near-exact match for much more recent experiences, and in jobs where Johnson\u2019s lack of care for details resulted in worse problems than a stray name or date here or there. One current British government minister who worked with Johnson when he was foreign secretary told The Daily Beast that so uninterested was Johnson in detail that his civil servants eventually lost their patience with him and decided to subject him to a secret test.\n\n\u201cHis civil servants prepared comprehensive briefing packs which were rarely used,\u201d said the minister. \u201cThey began to insert odd material in the latter chapters to see if he ever raised any queries or concerns, but they remained untroubled by BoJo.\u201d\n\nAsked to describe what it was like to attend meetings with Johnson, the minister said Britain\u2019s new PM is \u201clike a character from a P.G. Wodehouse novel, possessed of extraordinary charm and humor, and with a big brain unfortunately not always plugged in.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s time in the Foreign Office is now mainly remembered for the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British woman imprisoned in Iran over accusations of spying. Johnson said publicly she had been \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d in Iran, but her family maintained she was visiting relatives. Iranian officials seized on Johnson\u2019s slip-up as evidence that she had engaged in \u201cpropaganda against the regime,\u201d harming her chances of release. The most recent reports on her well-being say that she had been chained to a bed for days while being detained in a psychiatric ward.\n\nThe case was cited in the first resignation of Johnson\u2019s tenure on Monday, a day before he was announced as the new Conservative leader. Sir Alan Duncan, a colleague of Johnson\u2019s in the Foreign Office, quit in protest of his impending premiership, adding in his resignation letter that he was \u201cdeeply upset that some fruitful discussions I had initiated about the possible release of Nazanin Ratcliffe were brought to such an abrupt halt.\u201d He\u2019s previously vowed to end Johnson\u2019s career, and more resignations are expected after Johnson is officially prime minister.\n\nBut perhaps Johnson\u2019s most brutal evisceration came from his former Daily Telegraph boss Max Hastings, who wrote: \u201cFor many of us, his elevation will signal Britain\u2019s abandonment of any claim to be a serious country. It can be claimed that few people realized what a poor prime minister Theresa May would prove until they saw her in Downing Street. With Boris, however, what you see now is almost assuredly what we shall get from him as ruler of Britain.\u201d\n\nTime and again, Johnson\u2019s former colleagues paint him as a man who has the capacity to understand anything but decides not to out of lack of interest. However, Johnson isn\u2019t despised by all of his former colleagues. The most successful part of his CV is his time as London mayor, when he was a relatively popular figure who was praised for his part in delivering the London 2012 Olympic Games. Although exactly what his involvement was\u2014other than famously getting stuck dangling on a zip-line fluttering two Union Jacks\u2014has been questioned.\n\nHis deputy mayor between 2012 and 2015, Victoria Borwick, told The Daily Beast that she didn\u2019t recognize the ream of descriptions of her former boss as being inactive or liable to temper tantrums. She said he had a \u201clight-touch\u201d management style and was happy to let people and departments get on with their jobs if they were doing well, but would be intensely involved if he thought he wasn\u2019t getting what he was promised or something was going badly wrong. She predicted that\u2019s how he\u2019ll manage his government from Downing Street.\n\n\u201cBoris didn\u2019t have a temper at people , but at something not happening,\u201d said the former deputy. \u201cTo raise your voice is fine but he wouldn\u2019t be throwing and cussing and screaming at everybody. I\u2019ve worked in offices over my life where people had to creep around in terror, it wasn\u2019t like that at all. Absolutely not. Something would happen, someone would need to be spoken to, and he\u2019d want to know what we were going to do about it to make it right.\u201d\n\nBorwick also disputed that Johnson is a lazy leader, saying, \u201cI never found that if he needed to know the detail he didn\u2019t make sure he knew it. He gets up at 6 o\u2019clock in the morning, he reads his briefs, he reads his papers. He doesn\u2019t cut corners.\u201d\n\nIt has to be said that\u2019s far from the experience of everyone from Johnson\u2019s London mayoral office. Another of Johnson\u2019s deputy mayors, Roger Evans, said he \u201cvery quickly learned to brief [Johnson] in less than five minutes, adding that \u201cany longer was wasted time.\u201d Another one of Johnson\u2019s appointments while mayor, Brian Coleman, said he spent \u201chalf my meetings as his Fire Chairman telling him what I had told him at the last meeting.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that Johnson can be personally charming and inspire loyalty from his teams but, based on the accounts of multiple former colleagues, that side of him is frequently drowned out by the part of his personality that is frustrating and carelessly offensive. For example, when he began reciting a colonial-era Rudyard Kipling poem on a trip to the most sacred Buddhist site in Myanmar, which evoked the nostalgia of a retired serviceman looking back on his colonial service in the country. The recital was so embarrassing that the U.K. ambassador to Myanmar, Andrew Patrick, was forced to stop him and deal with the subsequent diplomatic fallout.\n\nOver his career, Johnson has also caused needless offense writing about \u201ctank-topped bum boys,\u201d African people with \u201cwatermelon smiles,\u201d \u201cpiccaninnies,\u201d and when he compared Muslim women who wear burqas to \u201cletter boxes\u201d and bank robbers, and predicted that the introduction of gay marriage would eventually lead to three men entering marital union with a dog. Whenever he\u2019s asked about these comments, he tends to say they were taken out of context rather than apologize.\n\nThis man with such obvious gaping character flaws is who Conservative party members have now decided to risk everything on by promoting him to prime minister as the country hurtles toward some of the most critical decisions it\u2019s made in decades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal job starting in an incredibly difficult position,\u201d said Johnson ally Borwick. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very, very difficult. The next 100 days\u2014until October 31\u2014is going to require all of Boris\u2019s little gray cells, or large gray cells, and he\u2019s going to need to put a team around him who can not only deliver Brexit but reunite the party and the country.\u201d\n\nWith Britain deeply divided, it does need someone to bring it together and wrench it out of Brexit paralysis. If that was entirely down to personal charm and wit, then Johnson would surely be the ideal candidate for the job. But whether he has the attention span to deal with the immense complexities of Brexit is a question keeping many, even those close to him, up at night.\n\nOver the coming months, the prime minister has to find consensus, solve problems, and earn support.
