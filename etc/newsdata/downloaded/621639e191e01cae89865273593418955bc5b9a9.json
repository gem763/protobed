(Will Newton/Getty Images)\n\nFollow our live updates from the wild-card game between the Washington Nationals and the Milwaukee Brewers below.\n\nSecond inning (in progress \u2014 Brewers 3, Nationals 0):\n\nMax Scherzer\u2019s nightmarish start continued in the second, as Eric Thames led off the inning with a home run over the scoreboard in right-center field. The Nationals bullpen was stirring after Thames crossed home plate to give Milwaukee a 3-0 lead.\n\n2 homers in 2 innings?\n\n\n\nThat'll quiet the home crowd. pic.twitter.com/vWAbwG2Op4 \u2014 MLB (@MLB) October 2, 2019\n\nAfter Lorenzo Cain grounded out, Orlando Arcia singled to right and Brandon Woodruff sacrificed him to second. With two outs, Scherzer got Trent Grisham swinging on his 28th pitch of the game.\n\nFirst inning (Brewers 2, Nationals 0):\n\nIn his last playoff start, Game 1 of the 2017 NLDS, Max Scherzer was perfect through three innings with four strikeouts. Scherzer started Tuesday\u2019s game with a leadoff walk to right fielder Trent Grisham. Brewers catcher Yasmani Grandal ripped Scherzer\u2019s next pitch into the Nationals bullpen to give Milwaukee a 2-0 lead and stun the Nationals Park crowd.\n\nScherzer settled down somewhat after Grandal\u2019s home run and a line out to left field by Mike Moustakas. Cleanup hitter Keston Hiura struck out swinging, and Ryan Braun, who received the loudest boos of the night when he was introduced, grounded out to third. Scherzer finished the inning at 18 pitches.\n\nMaking his third start since returning from an oblique injury that sidelined him for two months, Brewers starter Brandon Woodruff set down the Nats in order on 14 pitches. Trea Turner grounded out to short, Adam Eaton struck out swinging on a full count and Anthony Rendon, who stepped to the plate to scattered chants of \u201cM-V-P,\u201d popped out to first. Woodruff may be on a pitch count after not throwing more than 40 pitches in either of his previous two starts.\n\nPregame:\n\n\u2014 7:59 p.m.: Nationals reliever Aaron Barrett, who spent two years out of baseball and two years in the minor leagues after a gruesome elbow injury threatened his career, made an emotional return to the big leagues in September. \u201cThe Bear\u201d didn\u2019t make Washington\u2019s wild-card game roster, but in the first truly cool moment of these playoffs, he threw the ceremonial first pitch. Presumably, he didn\u2019t have to practice. Barrett waved his arms in the air to pump up the crowd before stepping on the mound, coming set and throwing a strike (the ghost umpire had a generous zone) to Harrisburg Senators Manager Matt Lecroy.\n\nFormer Nats fan favorite Michael Morse threw the ceremonial first pitch before the team\u2019s last home playoff game in 2017. Unlike Morse, don\u2019t expect Barrett to lead the crowd in a seventh-inning rendition of A-ha\u2019s \u201cTake On Me.\u201d\n\n\u2014 7:44 p.m.: Nationals starter Max Scherzer received a standing ovation as he walked to the bullpen to begin his warm-up at 7:30. Scherzer, who will be making his fourth career postseason start with Washington, has dominated several of the big hitters in Brewers Manager Craig Counsell\u2019s lineup in his career. Ryan Braun, Lorezno Cain and Yasmani Grandal are a combined 1 for 42 with 19 strikeouts against Scherzer. Rookie second baseman Keston Hiura, the Brewers\u2019 cleanup hitter tonight, has never faced the Nats\u2019 ace.\n\nWith half an hour to go before first pitch, a season highlight video is playing on the center field scoreboard. \u201cBaby Shark\u201d was featured, ever so briefly. Might we hear it again sometime tonight?\n\n\u2014 7:11 p.m.: Greetings from gradually filling Nationals Park, where the Brewers are just finishing batting practice and there\u2019s a steady stream of red walking through the center field gates. If the building pressure of a winner-take-all game doesn\u2019t make those in attendance sweat, the unseasonably muggy weather might. One person who isn\u2019t stressed? Nationals left fielder Juan Soto.\n\n\u201cI feel amazing,\u201d the 20-year-old said Tuesday afternoon, a few hours before his playoff debut. \u201cI feel really happy, first time being here. I can\u2019t wait to see the crowd, how it\u2019s going to be today, and they\u2019re going to be cheering and all this stuff. I\u2019m going to be really excited. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nIt's still 52 minutes before game time at Nats Park and there are already more people in their seats, on concourses, than there usually are in top of 2d inning in reg season.

Ryan Zimmerman and Stephen Strasburg are the only Nationals players or coaches who have witnessed, up close and personal, how horrifying a coin-toss game can be.
