It was set by South Korean climber Kim Chang-ho in 2013.\n\nMingma Sherpa of Seven Summit Treks in Kathmandu, which equipped the expedition, said the 36-year-old Purja was in good health and safely descending from the summit.\n\nClimbing experts called the record a momentous achievement in mountaineering history.\n\n\"It is a great achievement for mountaineering and mountaineers and a milestone in the history of climbing,\" said Ang Tshering, who previously headed the Nepal Mountaineering Association.\n\nPurja, who served with British special forces as a Gurkha from Nepal, in May took a photograph showing scores of climbers linked up on the summit ridge of Mount Everest, which went viral exposing the traffic jam in the so-called death zone of the world's highest mountain.\n\nThis photo taken on May 22 by Nirmal Purja shows heavy traffic of mountain climbers lining up to stand at the summit of Mount Everest.
