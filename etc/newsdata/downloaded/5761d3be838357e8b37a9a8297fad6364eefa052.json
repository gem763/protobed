Digital archaeology specialists from Australia\u2019s Flinders University have worked with maritime archaeologists at the University of Iceland to create a 360-degree virtual view of the wreck, which was discovered in 1992.\n\nThe ship was lost amid international tensions over Icelandic.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom of Denmark ruled Iceland and forbade other European nations from trading with the island,\u201d explained officials of Flinders University and the University of Iceland in a joint statement obtained by Fox News. \u201cHowever, in 1659 a surprise attack by the Swedish king on the Danish capital prevented any Danish supply ships from traveling to Iceland.\u201d\n\nWRECK OF WWII SHIP DISCOVERED 74 YEARS AFTER IT DISAPPEARED DURING A RESCUE MISSION\n\nKeen to grasp an opportunity for trade, Dutch merchants sent a small fleet of ships to Iceland under a false Danish flag.\n\n\u201cThis fleet was welcomed by locals and proved a success, trading grain, timber and ceramics from mainland Europe for locally caught and dried fish, woollen goods, sheepskins and whale oil,\u201d the universities explained in the statement.\n\nHowever, the Melckmeyt spent too long on its secret trading mission and was caught in the storm, losing one member of the ship\u2019s crew. \u201cThe survivors took shelter above water in the highest point of wreck for the next two days,\u201d said the universities.\n\nThanks to the icy Icelandic waters, the wreck is remarkably well preserved. Fourteen years after its discovery by local divers Erlendur Gu\u00f0mundsson and S\u00e6var \u00c1rnason, a team of researchers including experts from the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands and Kevin Martin, a graduate student at the University of Iceland, completed a detailed 3D survey of the site.\n\nSTUNNING CARGO DISCOVERED ON WELL-PRESERVED ROMAN SHIPWRECK\n\n\u201cThe significance of this wreck is enormous for Iceland,\" said Martin in the statement. \"As it is one of the oldest known historic wrecks in this part of the world, it shines a light on a fascinating period of Icelandic history, when Denmark ruled the island and had a monopoly over trade here for a period of 200 years. We have also been able to directly embed a 3D survey of the seabed with full photographic texture. In theory, a member of the public viewing this might even spot something on the wreck that we have missed during our dives on it!\u201d\n\nThe virtual dive was created by John McCarthy, a graduate student in maritime archaeology at Flinders University.\n\n\"We have even based the stern painting on a real contemporary Dutch painting, Vermeer\u2019s famous \u2018Milkmaid,' painted just one year before the ship was wrecked,\" he said in the statement.\n\nA paper on the virtual dive will be presented at the annual conference of the Australian Institute for Maritime Archaeology in Brisbane, Australia, on Oct. 18.\n\nSUNKEN WWII SHIP MAY CONTAIN $130 MILLION OF NAZI GOLD\n\nOther Icelandic shipwrecks have been garnering attention. Earlier this year, the wreck of the Empire Wold, a Royal Navy tug, was discovered by coastguards off the coast of Iceland. The discovery solved a decades-long mystery about the fate of the ship, which disappeared during a World War II rescue mission.\n\nThe ship sank on Nov. 10, 1944, with the loss of her 16 crewmembers. The sinking prompted speculation that the Empire Wold had fallen victim to a German U-boat, although the ship\u2019s discovery led experts to believe that she foundered in heavy seas and 40-knot winds.\n\nIn 2017, the SS Minden, a German cargo ship scuttled in waters near Iceland during the early days of World War II, was in the international spotlight following the reported discovery of a chest containing up to four tons of Nazi gold on the wreck.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "description": "Exactly 360 years to the day since the Dutch merchant ship Melckmeyt was wrecked off a remote Icelandic island, experts have harnessed virtual reality to create a stunning virtual dive of the wreck.", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/IcelandMilkmaid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
