Show Hide Born in 1976 just outside Moscow, Alexei Navalny is a lawyer-turned-campaigner whose Anti-Corruption Foundation investigates the wealth of Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle. He started out as a Russian nationalist, but emerged as the main leader of Russia's democratic opposition during the wave of protests that led up to the 2012 presidential election, and has since been a thorn in the Kremlin\u2019s side. Navalny is barred from appearing on state television, but has used social media to his advantage. A 2017 documentary accusing the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, of corruption received more than 30m views on YouTube within two months.\n\nHe has been repeatedly arrested and jailed. The European court of human rights ruled that Russia violated Navalny's rights by holding him under house arrest in 2014. Election officials barred him from running for president in 2018 due to an embezzlement conviction that he claims was politically motivated. Navalny told the commission its decision would be a vote 'not against me, but against 16,000 people who have nominated me; against 200,000 volunteers who have been canvassing for me'. There has also been a physical price to pay. In April 2017, he was attacked with green dye that nearly blinded him in one eye, and in July 2019 he was taken from jail to hospital with symptoms that one of his doctors said could indicate poisoning.

It also froze a slew of bank accounts linked to the foundation, a move Navalny\u2019s allies said was a trumped-up attempt to cripple his political movement.\n\nKira Yarmysh, Navalny\u2019s spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the scale and nature of the latest raids were unprecedented.\n\nLeonid Volkov, another senior Navalny ally, published a list of towns and cities where activists had been targeted.\n\n\u201cThe overall number of searches is over 150 and no less than 1,000 Russian law enforcement employees are involved [in the raids],\u201d Volkov wrote on social media. He linked the searches to Navalny\u2019s tactical voting strategy and said the homes of activists, their relatives and the regional headquarters of Navalny\u2019s movement were being targeted.\n\nActivists were being taken in for questioning, and technical hardware was being confiscated, he said.\n\n\u201cThe state has two tasks \u2013 to frighten and steal,\u201d Volkov wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the aim of this operation is to destroy our headquarters structure and to obstruct the work of our [regional] headquarters.\u201d\n\nGolos, a non-governmental organisation that monitors Russian elections, said on Thursday that the homes of its activists were also being raided by the authorities.\n\nNavalny and his supporters organised a wave of protests after popular opposition politicians were barred from standing in the Moscow parliament election, prompting a police crackdown.\n\nThe 43-year-old opposition leader missed several of the rallies while serving a 30-day jail term for organising previous unauthorised protests.", "description": "Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny says searches show \u2018Putin is very angry\u2019 after Moscow polls", "authors": ["Reuters In Moscow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091df892e5150fbed9c309f3ca03d1ade56a7fb9/10_0_4947_2968/master/4947.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c886ff068336193fb710a1bb0b85c20f", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
