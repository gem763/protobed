But even Juul\u2019s own website describes the mint pods as offering \u201ccrisp peppermint flavor,\u201d while the menthol version is \u201ctraditional menthol flavor with a brisk finish.\u201d\n\nThis all raises the question \u2014 if the mint pods were marketed as \u201ccandy cane\u201d or \u201cpeppermint patty,\u201d as customers have described them, would the FDA have allowed their continued sale?\n\nIn plain English, in what world is \u201cmint\u201d not a flavor?\n\nWe should want a marketplace where all players compete under equal rules. It is good public policy that we aim to keep e-cigarettes out of the hands of minors. That mission is advanced by having a set of guidelines that are fair to all retailers, not one that fundamentally favors some at the expense of others.\n\nWith mint e-cigarettes representing 70% of Juul\u2019s sales at the beginning of 2019, company officials are putting their own profits over the health and safety of our country\u2019s youth. Since Juul is one of the only companies in the market offering a mint-flavored product, it is undoubtedly sees the FDA\u2019s plan as a defense barrier to protect its market lead.\n\nIf the goal is to reduce youth e-cigarette use, and the FDA truly believes (as they have stated) that Juul bears a lot of the responsibility for the problem, why is mint now being allowed as the only flavor option?\n\nFDA regulators have good intentions, but they are being misguided and manipulated by hypocritical tobacco companies seeking to preserve their profit margins at the cost of a higher risk for American teenagers.\n\nThe flavor ban will create a huge hole in the marketplace and lead to a massive surge of phony counterfeit products and higher youth usage rates, results which is already starting to play out.\n\nIt is highly likely that banning flavored e-cigarette products could prompt former smokers to return to tobacco cigarettes. A 2017 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that banning flavors \u201cwould result in the increased choice of combustible cigarettes.\u201d\n\nA full restriction on e-cigarette flavors has the potential to harm American adult former smokers who have finally quit combustible cigarettes by forcing them to return to old dangerous habits.\n\nOn Sept. 4, 2019, Michigan placed a ban on all flavors of e-cigarettes, including mint. States like Michigan understand that the ban should not exclude any flavor. If the FDA truly wants to ban flavored e-cigarettes, it should follow Michigan\u2019s example.\n\nWe all have the same goal: Keep our country\u2019s youth safe and healthy. But the dominant e-cigarette players, Altria and Juul, are prioritizing their own profits over the American teenagers\u2019 health.\n\n\u2022 Matt Mackowiak is president of Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C.-based Potomac Strategy Group.
