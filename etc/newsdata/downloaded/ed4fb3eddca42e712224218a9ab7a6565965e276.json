USA TODAY\n\nKansas is under a lot of scrutiny these days after recently receiving a Notice of Allegations from the NCAA alleging big rules violations by the basketball team.\n\nBut it was under the microscope for a different reason Friday night thanks to a performance at their \"Late Night in the Phog\" kick-off event by legendary rapper Snoop Dogg.\n\nIn front of 16,300 fans at Allen Fieldhouse, Snoop closed out the night by performing apparently unedited versions of several hits, including \"Gin and Juice,\" \"The Next Episode\" and \"Drop It Like It's Hot,\" replete with a team of dancers using poles. He wore a Kansas jersey with \"Snoop\" on the back and even shot (fake) money into the crowd. ESPN reported that the fake $100 bills featured the rapper's own face.\n\nAfterward, Kansas athletics director Jeff Long apologized for the whole thing via a statement.\n\n\"We apologize to anyone who was offended by the Snoop Dogg performance at Late Night,\" Long said. \"We made it clear to the entertainers' manager that we expected a clean version of the show and took additional steps to communicate to our fans, including moving the artist to the final act of the evening, to ensure that no basketball activities would be missed if anyone did not want to stay for his show. I take full responsibility for not thoroughly vetting all details of the performance and offer my personal apology to those who were offended. We strive to create a family atmosphere at Kansas and fell short of that this evening.\"\n\nUpdated statement from KU AD Jeff Long on tonight's performance by Snoop Dogg at Late Night in the Phog... #KUbballpic.twitter.com/Q2dXZxGSVL \u2014 Matt Tait (@mctait) October 5, 2019\n\nIn more basketball-related happenings at the 35th annual preseason event, former Jayhawks star Sherron Collins earned two students $5,000 each by hitting a half-court shot.\n\nSherron Collins wins a couple of students $5 grand apiece with half court shot #kubball#LateNightpic.twitter.com/XisyHh094O \u2014 Benton Smith (@BentonASmith) October 5, 2019\n\nCoach Bill Self also acknowledged the allegations he and the program are facing.\n\n\"I\u2019ve heard from some people that bad publicity is better than no publicity,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I actually don\u2019t believe that for a second, but it felt good to say.\"\n\nOpinion: NCAA to Self: You're a cheater and we want you out of college hoops\n\nHe later added: \"I\u2019ve never felt that we could have more support from an administration than we do here at Kansas. I\u2019ve never felt we could have more support from an athletics department than we do at Kansas. We have the best fans in the world and I never felt we could have more support from our fans than we do here at the University of Kansas.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "description": "Kansas AD Jeff Long apologized after Snoop Dogg delivered a NSFW performance at the Jayhawks' \"Late Night in the Phog\" preseason event.", "authors": ["Jace Evans", "Published A.M.
