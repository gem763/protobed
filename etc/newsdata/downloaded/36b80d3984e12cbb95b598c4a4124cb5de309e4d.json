(Submitted by Jack Wilkins)\n\nDesign honours highland games\n\nThe competition \u2014 which celebrates structures with unique designs or paint jobs \u2014 has taken place since 2006.\n\nMaxville's structure, the only Canadian tower to make the final round, is emblazoned with the tartan of Glengarry, a unique hand-painted design created in honour of the local Glengarry Highland Games.\n\nEvery year, tens of thousands of people flock to the region for the games. It's a tradition that's gone on for over 70 years, and includes events such as fiddling, bagpiping, highland dancing and caber tossing.\n\nAnd while the tower might be quite a sight from the highway, it also serves a practical purpose: it was built as part of a massive project to bring drinking water into the community.\n\nThere's a new landmark in the community of Maxville.<br><br>This time-lapse video shows crews putting up a new water tower to connect residents and businesses in the township to the Alexandria treatment system. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ottawa?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ottawa</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ottnews?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ottnews</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Jmo5kkmvjj\">pic.twitter.com/Jmo5kkmvjj</a> \u2014@CBCOttawa\n\n\"We've been trying to get water to Maxville for probably 50 years,\" MacDonald told CBC Radio's All In A Day last week. \"We're excited to turn on the taps.\"\n\nWater is now piped from the nearby municipality of Alexandria, Ont., to the Maxville water tower, which is then supplied to local businesses and homes.\n\nThe project cost $30 million, half of which was paid by the federal government. The provincial and municipal governments split the other half.\n\n\"The icing on the cake was being able to put the tartan on there,\" said MacDonald. \"Again, we're pretty proud of it.\"\n\nVoting underway\n\nThe top 12 tanks are featured in an annual calendar created by Tnemec, with the contest winner then gets additional bragging rights.\n\nVoting for the people's choice award runs until Oct. 18, and ballots can be cast online on the contest website.\n\nThe winner of the people's choice award will be announced on Oct. 21, and the tank of the year winner \u2014 decided upon by a panel of water tank enthusiasts \u2014 will be declared Oct. 25.", "description": "It's worth $30 million, is clad in a stylish tartan, and \u2014 if the votes break just right \u2014 might end up as the best of its kind in North America.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5318350.1571017900!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/the-maxville-water-tower.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
