Wochit\n\nThe White House released photos they said show President Donald Trump watching the U.S. raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi unfold. Trump announced the U.S. operation on Sunday morning.\n\nTrump said Sunday that he watched as U.S. forces cornered al-Baghdadi in a dead-end tunnel, where the ISIS terrorist detonated a vest he was wearing, killing himself and several others. No U.S. forces were lost, Trump said.\n\nThe photo shows national security adviser Robert O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Trump, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and Deputy Director for Special Operations on the Joint Staff Marcus Evans. They all face the direction of the camera, appearing to watch the raid.\n\n\"The U.S. personnel were incredible,\" Trump said. \"I got to watch much of it.\"\n\nTrump said that his view from the Situation Room was \"as though you were watching a movie.\"\n\nThe White House released photos of President Donald Trump watching from the Situation Room as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a U.S. raid. (Photo: The White House)\n\nTrump described al-Baghdadi running in the tunnel, \"whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\" The president said that al-Baghdadi \"died like a dog.\"\n\nTrump also suggested that the footage of al-Baghdadi's death should be released so that his followers can see how he died.\n\nIt's not USA TODAY's policy to run White House hand out images. An exception was made in this case because of the newsworthiness of the image.\n\nTwitter users compared the White House photos to those taken during the operation that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, ordered by former President Barack Obama.\n\nOne iconic photo taken during that attack was taken by then-White House photographer Pete Souza. It shows Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with other members of the national security team.\n\nThe Trump situation room photo looks quite a bit more self conscious than the Obama one. pic.twitter.com/kg7rQyWyea \u2014 Raf Sanchez (@rafsanchez) October 27, 2019\n\nThe raid, as reported, took place at 3:30PM Washington time. The photo, as shown in the camera IPTC data, was taken at \"17:05:24\". https://t.co/XV0MFfFiTt \u2014 Pete Souza (@PeteSouza) October 27, 2019\n\nThe Situation Room then, and now.\n\nI like now. #Baghdadipic.twitter.com/s6ll4CTuPx \u2014 Alana Mastrangelo (@ARmastrangelo) October 27, 2019\n\nDuring his announcement, Trump suggested that al-Baghdadi's death was more significant than that of bin Laden.\n\nSon of Osama bin Laden \"Hamza bin Laden was a big thing, but this is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was very big but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\" Trump said. \"This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country, a caliphate. And was trying to do it again.\"\n\nIn 2012 Trump repeatedly tweeted that Obama should not be given credit for the operation against bin Laden.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/27/situation-room-photos-out-trump-watching-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-raid/2478527001/", "description": "Donald Trump described watching the raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death \"as though you were watching a movie.\"", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published P.M.
