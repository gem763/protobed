In scenes set to air tonight on Channel 5's Fare Dodgers: At War With the Law, two seasoned investigators track down a woman in her mid-twenties who calls the service for refunds several times a day\n\nStanding just shy of seven-feet tall detective Dan Middlehurst has worked for TfL for 18 years. He tracks down a serial fraudster who has claimed back more than \u00a31000 in false refunds\n\nSince she has to travel through Zone 1 to make the trip, the women's cost could be as much as \u00a38.20 a journey, but all journeys between Zone 1 and 8 will be capped at a maximum of \u00a382.50 a week.\n\nAt Transport for London\u2019s control centre, investigator Tim looks into a possible long-running scam after receiving information from customer services about a commuter who is known to have contacted TfL\u2019s refund hotline hundreds of times in a three month period, running up more than a thousand pounds in suspicious transactions.\n\n'Customer services deal with refunds for customers on occasions where someone may have been overcharged or charged incorrectly' Tim says.\n\n'In this particular case there's a suspicious activity'\n\nTerry, who works for customer services adds: 'The customer phones three or four times a day to say they need a refund, where they haven't touched in or out properly.\n\n'Or where they've touched in and then claimed to have not travelled at all.\n\n'They don't realise how much information we actually see behind the scenes. A lot of customers seem to think they can foil the investigation.\n\nDan Ambamov (pictured) stays in touch with his colleague, also called Dan, to apprehend the woman at West Ham station\n\nGetting the money back is down to two investigators, Dan Middlehurst and Dan Ambramov.\n\nWith a telephone recording retained as evidence, the inspectors are able to determine the suspect is a female offering a variety of excuses, at times claiming she had failed to tap out by mistake or simply not travelled after entering a station.\n\n'I went in the station and went to check my balance - I went into the station and didn't go anywhere' the recording says.\n\nStanding just shy of seven-feet tall detective Dan Middlehurst has worked for TfL for 18 years.\n\nWith a telephone recording retained as evidence, the inspectors are able to determine the suspect is a female offering a variety of excuses, at times claiming she had failed to tap out by mistake or simply not travelled after entering a station. They apprehend her and she refuses to speak to them (pictured)\n\n'A lot of forethought gone in with this young lady, she's very very crafty, but we can see from her history the refunds are getting closer and closer together, and it's that overconfidence that's going to help us with the investigation' he says.\n\nThe paired then analysed CCTV to ID the suspect to prove they travelled on days where refunds were claimed.\n\nOnce they'd identified they found her, Dan and Dan were able to match up her transactions of tapping in and out with CCTV footage, they decided to track her down while she's on her way to work.\n\nTracking her oyster card usage in real time, they see her touch in at Bushey.\n\nKnowing it will take her about an hour and a half to get to West Ham, it's a race against the clock for them to get to the station in time to meet her.\n\nOnce they'd identified they found her, Dan and Dan were able to match up her transactions of tapping in and out with CCTV footage, they decided to track her down while she's on her way to work\n\nStaying in contact on Walkie Talkies with each other, they apprehend the woman at West Ham station and tell her the jig is up.\n\nAmid the morning rush, they are able to stop the woman who, despite being warned of the seriousness of investigation, refuses to comment and requests a more formal interview at a later date.\n\nMr Middlehurst tells her: 'We've been conducting an investigation on you for a number of months now. We've got a file here with some bits and pieces and we're going to need to do an interview with you.\n\nShe then tells investigators she doesn't have 'an inkling of an idea' as to why she's been stopped.\n\nDan presents her with a book full of evidence showing her false claims and fraudulent journeys\n\n'You've been committing offence on the railway' Mr Middleshurt adds.\n\n'This is possible fraud, we have a lot of evidence to show you. These are serious, you need to get the notion out of your head that you need to be at work in five minutes'\n\nClearly surprised by the amount of information TfL know about her, she decides to not make any comment without legal representation.\n\nAfter she leaves, Mr Middlehurst asks his colleagues: 'Did you see that look on her face? That little glimpse of \"s**t I've been caught\"?'\n\nThe woman was later interviewed under caution and admitted to the accusations put to her by TFL.\n\nInvestigator\u2019s believe that 293 fraudulent journeys were made in total. She could now be liable to pay back the equivalent of four months travel, plus costs. The case will be handled by prosecutors at Transport for London who are building a case for court.\n\nShe later admitted all the offences, claiming 209 false refunds totalling \u00a31093.35, as well as \u00a3294.80 worth of fare evasion - a total of 293 offences.\n\nProsecutors are now seeking to claim \u00a31388.15 plus legal and investigation fees back through court.", "description": "In scenes set to air tonight on Channel 5's Fare Dodgers: At War With the Law, investigators chase down a woman from Hertfordhisre, who asked for fake refunds across at least eight Oyster cards.", "authors": ["Bridie Pearson-Jones For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/15/20248158-0-image-a-5_1572190931961.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
