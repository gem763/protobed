The fare increase began earlier this month and immediately sparked outrage throughout the country, as the cost of living for poor and middle class Chileans has continued to rise.\n\nBut as the number of demonstrators grew, protesters spilled into the street and set fire to subway stations, banks, buses cars, and the headquarters of the country\u2019s largest electricity provider, Enel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPeople also looted pharmacies, supermarkets and other stores, the Times reported. The protests spread to at least four other cities in Chile and are expected to continue Saturday night, despite the state of emergency that limits how people may move and assemble freely.\n\nChile's current state gives the army authority over internal security, according to the Times, which is why troops were spread out across the streets of Santiago Saturday.\n\nPi\u00f1era said in a televised address from the presidential palace that the state of emergency was declared to restore order, calling the protesters \u201cdelinquents,\u201d the Times reported. He added that his administration will try to find a way to \u201calleviate\u201d the burden of rising transit costs in the city. A subway ride at rush hour currently costs approximately $1.20.\n\n\"The objective of this state of emergency is very simple, but very profound,\" Pi\u00f1era said, \"it's to ensure public order, bring peace to Santiago and protect public and private property.\"", "description": "Troops roamed the streets of Santiago, Chile after long protests\u00a0turned violent Saturday, resulting in more than 150 injured police officers and more than 300 arrests,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/chile_101919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
