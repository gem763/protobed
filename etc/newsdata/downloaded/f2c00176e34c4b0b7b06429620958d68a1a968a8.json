You spent long hot, cramped hours sitting on tarmac long after your flight should have taken off, maybe even landed at your destination.\n\nBy that point you had hoped be sitting by a pool with a cold beverage enjoying the first evening of your long-awaited, much-needed summer break. Instead you listened keenly through the cries of equally frustrated children for information, for any scrap of detail, about what on earth is stopping this metal bird getting airborne.\n\nFor want of something else to do, you started planning your compensation claim. But at the back of your mind you already suspected it wouldn\u2019t be an easy process. Citizens Advice says flight chaos and problematic flights are the number one issue driving people to the consumer page of its website.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn fact, almost half of all valid compensation claims by passengers following UK flight disruption are initially refused according to a new study by air passenger claims management business AirHelp, which calculates that airlines owe money to nearly 448,000 passengers following UK flight disruptions already this year.\n\nAnd yet the law is pretty clear.\n\nAccording to the European law EC 261, if a flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled, or in an instance of denied boarding \u2013 passengers are entitled to financial compensation of up to \u20ac600 (\u00a3530) if the cause of the disruption was in the airline\u2019s control.\n\nAll passengers departing from a European airport are covered under EC 261, and passengers flying into Europe from other worldwide destinations may be covered when flying on a European carrier. Passengers have up to three years to claim financial compensation following a disrupted flight.\n\nDepending on the length of the delay the airline may also have to help pay for food and drink, provide access to calls and email and provide accommodation if you are delayed overnight. The airline is only exempt when the disruption was caused by an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d \u2013 one that is truly out of the airlines control, such as bad weather.\n\nBut AirHelp warns airlines are regularly providing baseless excuses and wrongly citing \u201cForce Majeure\u201d (extraordinary circumstances) \u2013 including operational issues which are often within the airlines control \u2013 in an attempt to shirk their responsibilities for the delay or cancellation and not pay compensation.\n\nThere are three terms most commonly used to deter claimants.\n\nAirline staff strike\n\nWith a spate of strikes planned at Heathrow by airport staff this summer, this is a crucial circumstance to know about.\n\nStrikes by those not managed by the airline are indeed out of their control, such as action by baggage handlers. As such the airline is not liable to pay passengers compensation because it couldn\u2019t do anything directly about it.\n\nBut many passengers are told they\u2019re not owed compensation when disruption was caused by a strike by the airline\u2019s own staff. In 2018 the European Court of Justice ruled that strikes by flight staff do not constitute an extraordinary circumstance.\n\nAirlines are accountable for the actions of their employees and also have a duty of care to passengers who are stranded due to a delay or cancellation, which includes food, drink, communication, and if necessary, accommodation.\n\nCrew or pilot shortages\n\nThe entire commercial airline industry is facing a shortage of pilots for both cargo and passenger planes. However, it is the airline\u2019s responsibility to ensure measures are in place to avoid crew or pilot shortages. Crew sickness, for example, is not an extraordinary circumstance that would free the airline from its obligation to compensate.\n\nTechnical or operational issues\n\nAirlines must adhere to strict safety procedures which means \u2018technical issues\u2019 should be identified and prevented during routine checks and maintenance. Although it is rare to find a technical related issue that is still classed as an extraordinary circumstance, airlines are commonly using this reason to wrongly convince passengers that the delay or cancellation was out of their control.\n\nPaloma Salmeron, an air passenger rights commentator at AirHelp, said: \u201cWe urge passengers to question the reason given by an airline if their flight is disrupted and to check if they\u2019re entitled to compensation. Airlines can no longer pick and choose which parts of the law to adhere to.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly pleased to see the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has taken enforcement action against an airline for refusing to compensate passengers following strike disruption. UK travellers are tired of having the wool pulled over their eyes by airlines who have long ignored the laws put in place to protect passenger rights.\u201d\n\nChecklist: What to do in the case of a flight disruption\n\n1. Contact your airline to arrange your alternative flight to your destination (or a refund).\n\n2. Hold onto your boarding pass and any other travel documents.\n\n3. Ask why the flight was disrupted\n\n4. Ask the airline to pay for your meals, drinks, and accommodation when necessary \u2013 you have the Right to Care, meaning that the airline is responsible for making sure you receive the above.\n\n5. Keep your receipts if your disrupted flight ends up costing you extra money.\n\n6. Make a note of the arrival time at your destination.\n\n7. Check if you\u2019re owed compensation.", "description": "You\u2019re probably familiar with the scenario.
