More than 100 people have been killed and thousands wounded in this latest round of protests, some of the biggest Iraq has seen in years.\n\n\n\nPeace was mostly restored after Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi declared a three-day mourning period for civilians and police killed in the past week. But rights groups say the initial heavy-handed response, as well as a days-long internet blackout, signals officials\u2019 resolve to preserve the status quo.\n\n\n\nThis is a problem for many of those demonstrating in support of a complete overhaul of the government. Advocates of this strategy say the system that\u2019s been in place for more than a decade only serves those in power, at the expense of everyday Iraqis.\n\n\n\nOthers believe the best way forward is for the government to make good on a new reform plan to tackle poverty and corruption. But with the prime minister warning that there are \"no magic solutions,\" many are skeptical that things will actually change.\n\n\n\nDuring Monday's episode we ask, will protesters in Iraq get what they want? Join the conversation.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nIn Iraq, Protesters Are Sick of Corruption and Foreign Influence - Foreign Policy\n\nIraq protests: 'No magic solution' to problems, PM says - BBC\n\nIraq: Lethal Force Used Against Protesters - Human Rights Watch\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?
