However, sources have said that there is 'no rush' and that a vote is expected now at February's get-together instead.\n\nALL-BRITISH BIKE UNVEILED FOR 2020 OLYMPICS\n\nBritish Cycling are to unveil a bike that has been entirely designed and manufactured in the UK, as they launch their track team's campaign for the 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe all-British bike, to be revealed at the Rouleur Classic in London on Thursday, represents a departure from previous years.
