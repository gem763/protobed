We have to do this because trains have been backed up until the railway was fixed and to bring all services back instantly would cause huge congestion.\u201d\n\nAll 10 trains from Cambridge to Brighton scheduled between 4.30am and 10am were cancelled, with subsequent services heavily delayed.\n\nAt 10am, after the rush hour had been wiped out, the train operator told users: \u201cDue to multiple incidents at City Thameslink and London Blackfriars yesterday evening, the power was switched off to the railway lines between London St Pancras International and London Blackfriars.\n\n\u201cThis suspended overnight and early morning services today.\n\n\u201cThameslink trains are now resuming through Central London, but services will remain severely disrupted for some time.\u201d\n\nOne passenger, Max Burrell, tweeted: \u201cThe current state of the Thameslink line is nothing short of a disgrace.\n\n\u201cThird day this week I\u2019ve walked into the station and near to everything was cancelled. That\u2019s unreliable to me.\u201d\n\nCancellations will continue into the afternoon and may affect the evening rush hour.\n\nThe train operator said: \u201cReplacement buses have been deployed to Redhill, Three Bridges, Horsham and Haywards Heath to cover train service gaps at the smaller stations.\u201d\n\nThameslink also connects Luton and Gatwick airports with central London and with each other.\n\nTravellers between London and Gatwick airport who use the alternative rail connection, from Victoria, face further disruption caused by what the train operator called \u201ca number of incidents between London Victoria and East Croydon\u201d.\n\nThese include flooding in the Clapham Junction area, a broken-down train at Norbury and a platform closure at Victoria after a passenger was taken ill.\n\nAlmost all trains at Gatwick airport are either cancelled or delayed.\n\nThameslink was blamed for the botched introduction of radical new timetables in May 2018, which brought the service almost to a standstill.", "description": "Tens of thousands of Thameslink commuters endured another dreadful rush hour, after the central spine of the cross-London line was closed to all passenger trains.
