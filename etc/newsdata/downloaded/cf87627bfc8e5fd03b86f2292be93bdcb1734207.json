If no candidate gets 51% of the vote, a second round will be held between the two leading candidates.\n\nTaliban fighters attacked several polling stations across the country to try to derail the process, but intense security prevented the large-scale violence of previous polls.\n\n\u201cThis election was the healthiest and fairest election in comparison to the previous elections,\u201d said Hawa Alam Nuristani, head of country\u2019s Independent Election Commission (IEC), after the voting concluded.\n\nTen of thousands of Afghans braved the threat of militant attacks and delays at polling booths to vote in the election, a major test of the Western-backed government\u2019s ability to protect democracy against Taliban attempts to derail it.\n\nTwo policeman and one civilian were killed in mostly small-scale Taliban attacks, the defence ministry said, adding 37 people were injured.\n\nTens of thousands of troops were deployed to try to protect voters and polling stations.\n\nIEC officials did not immediately share the details on turnout, but Western diplomats in Kabul estimated it was low due to fears of violence and delays caused by polling officials.\n\nVoting was extended by two hours, after technical problems delayed the opening of some polling stations around the country.\n\nIndependent election observers and activists said a slow pace to voting triggered confusion at some polling stations, with long queues forming outside.\n\n\u201cIt took the first voter 31 minutes to vote. For subsequent voters it was taking around five minutes and then it started to streamline to 3 minutes and 30 seconds,\u201d said Nishank Motwani, an observer stationed in Kabul.\n\n\u201cElection commission staff looked panicked and voters were getting angry that the queue was not moving.\u201d\n\nTALIBAN INTERVENTION?\n\nSome observers feared the Taliban had forced a partial shutdown to upset the final results as the IEC, without giving a reason, said it had failed to establish contact with 901 of the 4,942 polling centres.\n\nThe hardline Islamist group, which controls more of the country than at any time since its regime fell in 2001, had warned the more than nine million registered voters to stay at home or face dire consequences.\n\nSaturday\u2019s presidential vote is the fourth since the Taliban was toppled.\n\nOver a dozen candidates are vying for the presidency, led by incumbent Ashraf Ghani and his former deputy Abdullah Abdullah.\n\nThe winner will play a crucial role in the country\u2019s quest to end the war with the Taliban and any resumption of talks between the militant Islamist group and the United States, which were called off this month.\n\nThe Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan said early turnout was \u201cvery poor\u201d, in part due to the requirement for voters to be photographed, to which female voters in conservative areas objected.\n\nOthers were determined to vote.\n\nAfghan presidential candidate Ashraf Ghani arrives to cast his vote in the presidential election in Kabul, Afghanistan September 28, 2019. REUTERS/Mohammad Ismail\n\n\u201cBravado gets defined when one musters courage to cast one\u2019s vote,\u201d said Kabul doctor Roya Jahangir after casting her ballot. \u201cWe hope this time there is no fraud.\u201d\n\nHundreds of voters complained their names were missing from voters\u2019 lists or the biometric devices used to prevent fraud. Addressing those concerns, the IEC eased restrictions, allowing anyone with election stickers on their national identity cards to vote.\n\nPOLLING STATIONS ATTACKED\n\nThe small-scale attacks included an explosion at a polling station in a mosque in the southern city of Kandahar which wounded 16 people, according to a security source.\n\nIn the northern province of Faryab, Afghan forces clashed with Taliban fighters in six districts, forcing people to stay indoors.\n\nThe Taliban said its fighters attacked polling stations in Laghman province, in eastern Afghanistan. Officials said four explosions in the eastern city of Jalalabad, in which one person was killed, disrupted voting at some stations.\n\nBlasts also hit Kabul and Ghazni, officials said, while more than 400 polling centres remained closed because they were in areas under Taliban control.\n\nWestern diplomats said the scale of the militant group\u2019s attacks would determine whether talks with Washington resumed.\n\n\u201cTalks can only begin if the Taliban exercises restraint and allows people to vote,\u201d said one diplomat overseeing the elections.\n\nGhani cast his ballot in a Kabul high school, telling reporters: \u201cI thank God that today that people\u2019s vote will help the republic of Afghanistan to move forward.\u201d\n\nAbdullah voted at a different Kabul school. \u201cThe threats to innocent people do not show the strength of the Taliban,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (22 Images)\n\nBoth men came to power in 2014 after a bitterly contested election marred by fraud.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s political scene is still tainted by the aftermath of that vote, which forced the two main rival groupings to form an unstable partnership. Both sides were accused of massive electoral cheating.", "description": "Tight security ensured Afghanistan's presidential election was held on Saturday in relative calm, though several small attacks, low turnout and complaints about the voting system heightened fears an unclear result could drive the country into further chaos.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434825036&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R04S", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
