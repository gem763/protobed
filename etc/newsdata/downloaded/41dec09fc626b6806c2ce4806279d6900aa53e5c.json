New Zealand remain the best team in the some distance, capable of accelerating to a different speed to the rest of the rugby playing world, of finding a gear no-one else can access.\n\nYet, still, we doubted them. There was a sense that this was not the unconquerable side of years past, that there was an underlying vulnerability to Steve Hansen\u2019s side. It had been exposed previously, twice by Ireland, of course. During the Rugby Championship an early red card allowed Australia a rout; South Africa frustrated and stagnated and secured a draw. Their summer preparations were not perfect. But when the big match World Cup lights came on, with the opportunity to right the wrongs of those two defeats against a familiar foe, there were simply outstanding.\n\nThis was a different New Zealand. If you could accuse them of a lack of intensity in those defeats in Chicago and in Dublin, they were positively overflowing with purpose here. They had been caught cold by an Irish team twice, out-muscled and out-worked on both occasions \u2013 there were not going to be in Tokyo.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

A common criticism of this side is their monotonous, one-track rugby, with little invention to their attacking play and no clear plan B should the opposition gain forward parity, or, even worse, ascendancy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Their attempts to work backs moves were inaccurate and slow, and they were too often forced to kick the ball away in their attempts to get any kind of go forward. New Zealand were prepared for the high bombs, and defused them.\n\nWhere Ireland had managed to dominate up front in Chicago and Dublin, here they were on the back foot from early on. The return of Brodie Retallick, the premier lock in rugby, meant New Zealand\u2019s eight was at full strength for the first time all tournament. In Nepo Laulala, Sam Whitelock, Sam Cane and Retallick they possess four of the most punishing tacklers at the World Cup \u2013 Ireland\u2019s attempts to foray around the fringes found uncomfortable homes.\n\nThere is little left to write about the All Blacks attack that has not been written before. The speed of their rugby is remarkable, and they play with the joyful expression that comes only by being born with a ball in your hands and an understanding of how to execute a two-on-one.\n\nTheir ability to regenerate is absurd, the strength-in-depth obscene. This is a very different side to the one that lifted the trophy four years ago, and one that only settled on their preferred combinations this summer, with Ardie Savea and Sam Cane destructive flankers operating in tandem, and Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett parallel creators par excellence, but it looks like they have been doing this for years, with incredible chemistry and understanding.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s phase play is incredible: the speed of ball, the variety of attacking options, the intensity of carries, the work-rate of the tight five. All 23 members of the squad are capable ball-handlers, able to challenge defences in different manners.\n\nPerhaps their greatest quality is their ability to shift the point of contact, and keep movements going. They are rugby\u2019s version of the hydra \u2013 chop down one carrier and two more pop up, ready for the offload. Invariably it comes, and, almost inevitably, it goes to hand.\n\nNone of that would be possible without Aaron Smith.\n\nSmith has been doubted since the last World Cup. He had issues with form, playing in a Highlanders side domestically that hasn\u2019t always fired, and off-field controversy, too. It has been argued that the fervent intensity and defensive steel of TJ Perenara might be preferable as the starting nine.\n\nBut Perenara is not the passer that Smith is, and to play such an up-tempo game they need accuracy and pace from the base of the ruck. Much has been made of Mo\u2019unga and Barrett\u2019s development as a pair, but Smith is the metronome that keeps this side ticking.\n\nHis speed of pass and release from the floor enables New Zealand to shift the ball wide quicker than any side. There is no false-stepping around the base, just efficient distribution. His first receiver can stand a channel wider in the line, enabling them to get to the outside shoulder more often. Smith\u2019s sharpness allows his carriers to come on to the ball at pace, not consider their step or have to adjust for a misplaced pass. That means they win the collision more often than not, giving further front-foot ball with which Smith can work.\n\nCodie Taylor\u2019s try early in the second half is the perfect example of what such an accurate and incisive passer provides. Smith has three options as he picks up at the base, including two adjacent runners virtually at the line in Joe Moody and Kieran Read.\n\nThere should not be space for Smith to fit the ball across the face of Moody and into the hands of Read, but he gets it there, a laser along the line to put his captain into a half-hole. Iain Henderson is wrong-footed, preparing himself for a rumble from Moody. On his back foot he slipped down to the hips of Read, not managing to wrap up the ball in the two-man tackle with Tadhg Furlong going low. That allowed Read to get his arms free, and, of course, offload to Taylor in support.\n\nThe tries were almost secondary to Smith\u2019s performance, a tour de force from a player truly asserting himself as the world\u2019s best scrum-half once more. New Zealand might have five or six that would get in a composite world fifteen, but no-one is more important to this side than Smith, the tempo and tone-setter.\n\nNew Zealand dismantled Ireland, just as they did France at this stage four years ago. It was 62-13 on that occasion; 46-14 on this. This was a showing to put the rest of the tournament on notice \u2013 the All Blacks are back to their best.\n\nNew Zealand are here, and if they reproduce this performance in the semi-final and final, no-one is going to stop them retaining their crown.", "description": "Perhaps we should have seen this coming.
