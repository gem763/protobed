But that has changed since Erdogan and Putin revealed the details of the agreement, which could see significant territorial gains for Syrian government forces in the former Kurdish areas and joint Turkish-Russian patrols of the border.\n\n\u201cThere are many worries about [Bashar] al-Assad\u2019s forces entering the area with the Russians and taking control over the region, which would be a disaster,\u201d he continued.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rights groups released reports that Turkish-led forces had likely committed war crimes including indiscriminate strikes and execution-style killings of Kurdish politicians.\n\nBut the embarrassing Nato fracture appeared to come to an end on Wednesday when Trump said he would lift the punitive measures on Turkey as it had agreed to a permanent ceasefire.\n\nUnder the deal outlined by Russia the day before, the Kurds would withdraw past a 30km buffer zone along the Turkish border. Syrian government \u201cborder guards\u201d would be deployed with Russia military police to ensure this. Turkey and Russia would run join patrols at 10km.\n\n\u201cCountless lives are now being saved as a result of our negotiations with Turkey,\u201d Trump said from the White House on Wednesday taking, credit for the agreement.\n\nIt is \u201can outcome reached without spilling one drop of American blood\u201d, he added.\n\nBut back in Syria many began to worry.\n\nMazloum Abdi, the commander-in-chief of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic forces, thanked Trump and Putin for the assistance in brokering the truce. However, he also \u201cexpressed reservations about some items of the agreement\u201d without elaborating.\n\nPanicked members of the Kurdish autonomous administration are expected to meet Russian officials soon to express their fears about some of terms. No one would go into details.\n\nAmong the most contentious parts for the Kurds is Ankara\u2019s plan to repatriate Syrian refugees in Turkey to northeast Syria, changing the demographics of the area.\n\nAnother sticking point is likely to concern Kurdish fighters evacuating the commercial hub of Manbij, which is home to some 300,000 people and is located just 30km from the border.\n\n\u201cUntil now no one has explained to us what will happen to cities on the borderlines, and how the Syrian army will be deployed,\u201d Akram, a Kurdish reporter near Manbij, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cWill the regime take back control? What would happen to the autonomy we have?\u201d\n\nHe said the Kurds were also concerned about the behaviour of pro-Turkish forces who have been accused by rights groups of committing war crimes including summary executions.\n\n\u201cAll the Kurdish forces withdrawing stirs fear in us, what will the pro-Turkish forces do?\u201d he asked.\n\nAhmed, who works with the Kurdish Red Crescent and asked that his name be withheld, raised concerns about local medical personnel who have worked closely with the international coalition fighting Isis and foreign NGOs that are not recognised by the regime.\n\n\u201cAssad regime\u2019s security branches are likely to assassinate many people here since we are accused of treason for dealing with a foreign country and the international coalition,\u201d he said.\n\nAhmed is also a medical coordinator at Roj displaced camp, which is home to at least 950 foreign affiliates of Isis including ex-Briton Shamima Begum, one of a trio of girls from Bethnal Green in east London who joined Isis.\n\nHe was also worried about who would take over the Isis camps and prisons.\n\nThese fears were also echoed in Qamishli, a Kurdish border town. It is home to several key Isis detention centres, including a prison holding former British citizen Jack Letts or \u201cJihadi Jack\u201d.\n\nUnder the agreement, Kurdish forces would have to vacate the city but Turkish troops are not permitted to patrol, leaving only the regime.\n\n\u201cHere the Kurdish government used to run everything: the schools, the administration, the camps, the prisons \u2013 what will happen when they have to leave?\u201d Sara, a Kurdish resident, asked.\n\n\u201cThe other big fear here is compulsory military conscription into the government army, we are worried about our young men, our boy,\u201d she added.\n\nOn the other side of the conflict in Ras al-Ayn, and Tal Abyad, Turkish-backed Syrian rebels and their supporters also voiced fears since they say they are considered \u201cthe enemies of the Syrian government\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for Turkish diplomacy, but we are worried about control of the regime and [its allies] Iranian militias over the eastern region. This was not stipulated in the agreement with Russia,\u201d one pro-Turkey Syrian fighter said.\n\nOutside Tal Abyad, Maher summed it up.\n\n\u201cThese countries sing human rights slogans but only care about their own good,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe hope peace, love and security prevail in their countries and we hope death would leave ours.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump heralded this week\u2019s ceasefire deal in northeastern Syria as\u00a0\u201ca great job ... and something very special\u201d.
