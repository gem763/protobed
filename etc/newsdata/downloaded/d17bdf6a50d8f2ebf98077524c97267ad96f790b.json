Buyers will need to specify if they want a petrol or hybrid\n\nThe radical turning on its head of accepted convention comes as the Swedish car company launched its first ever all-electric car \u2013 the XC40 sport utility vehicle - to kick-start a new battery-powered range under the umbrella title Recharge as part of 'a new electrified car line'.\n\nRecharge will cover both pure electric and plug-in hybrid Volvos.\n\nThe new XC40 Recharge unveiled in Los Angeles on Wednesday is based on the award-winning XC40 small SUV and Volvo said it is 'the first of a family of fully electric Volvos.\n\nIt will go on sale in the UK next year with a price expected to be around \u00a350,000 \u2013 above the level of the most expensive petrol version \u2013 though costs could be mitigated by the \u00a33,500 taxpayer-funded subsidy for zero-emissions cars and by a series of incentives which Volvo itself is planning.\n\nVolvo also pledged to launch a fully electric car every year with the aim of making all-electric cars account for half its global sales by 2025 \u2013 with the other half as petrol-electric hybrids.\n\nThat would mean no pure or conventional petrol cars by that date.\n\nThe first pure-electric Volvo will be this XC40 Recharge. Recharge is the sub-brand name given for all models in the manufacture's range that are sold with a plug\n\nAs you can see, there's no engine under the bonnet of this XC40 - which has been an award-collecting success since it launched\n\nInstead, the vehicle is powered by 300kW electric motor supplemented by a 48kw battery\n\nOn that road to electrification, Volvo Cars also said that it is aiming aims for plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars to make up 20 per cent of total sales next year.\n\nA Volvo spokesman said: 'From early 2020 customers entering the Volvo Cars website will first be asked whether they want a Volvo Recharge car or not.'\n\nHe added: 'Financial incentives designed to further encourage electric driving will also be part of the Recharge offer.'\n\nUK drivers currently get a taxpayer-funded Government subsidy of \u00a33,500 off the list-price price of a zero-emissions electric vehicle.\n\nVolvo Cars also said that it is aiming aims for plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars to make up 20 per cent of total sales next year\n\nPowered by a 408 horse-power electric motor, the all-wheel drive XC40 Recharge will accelerate from rest to 60mph in just 4.7 seconds and up to a top speed of 112mph\n\nThe XC40 Recharge promises a range of more than 248 miles (400km) on a full charge\n\nSetting out its electrified future, the Swedish car firm said: 'Over the next five years, Volvo Cars will launch a fully electric car every year, as it seeks to make all-electric cars 50 per cent of global sales by 2025, with the rest hybrids.\n\n'Recharge will be the overarching name for all chargeable Volvos with a fully electric and plug-in hybrid powertrain.'\n\nThe manufacture's chief executive H\u00e5kan Samuelsson said: 'We have said this several times before: for Volvo Cars, the future is electric.\n\n'Today we take a major new step in that direction with the launch of our fully electric XC40 and the Recharge car line.'\n\nVolvo chief executive H\u00e5kan Samuelsson (left) unveiled the new Volvo XC40 Recharge at an event\n\nThe new XC40 Recharge is also the first Volvo with a brand new infotainment system powered by Google's Android operating system\n\nPowered by a 408 horse-power electric motor, the all-wheel drive XC40 Recharge will accelerate from rest to 60mph in just 4.7 seconds and up to a top speed of 112mph.\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge: Will it fit in my garage?
