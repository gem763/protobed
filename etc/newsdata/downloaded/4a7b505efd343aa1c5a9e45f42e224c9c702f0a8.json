They became concerned and called the police and ambulance. They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\n\n\"My parents were already there. Then this person must have called again and the ambulance turned up at around 4pm and we had a quick chat on the doorstep. He said it was a lovely house.\n\n\"I wasn't speaking to this person for a reason and they were worried about my safety because I wasn't answering the phone. I was perfectly fine, we all had a chat and carried on the day with my parents, we were just hanging up pictures.\"\n\nArg added: \u201cThe police and paramedics were only here for about ten minutes. I'm slightly embarrassed really. I apologise for any wasted police time as I was absolutely fine.\"\n\nHe said the police did not force their way into his home.\n\nIn a statement, Metropolitan Police said: \"Police were called at 13.11hrs to a residential address following concerns for the welfare of male occupant. Officers attended with LAS [London Ambulance Service]. The male, in his 30s, was spoken to. He was left in the company of family.\n\n\"Officers were called at 16.21hrs to the same address, again due to concerns for the same male's welfare. The male declined assistance.\"\n\nMirror Online has contacted Arg's rep for comment previously.", "description": "They have had a turbulent on/off romance for years yet it could really be over for good this time", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Splash Itv", "Supplied Wenn", "Instagram", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article19012662.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_Gemma-Collins-Diva-Forever.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
