The photos show that her hair is now a natural mousey blonde\n\nIn July, a Parole Board panel cleared her for release, saying she was no longer a \u2018significant risk to the public\u2019 despite pleas to keep her behind bars.\n\nGeorge was released last month \u2013 much to the dismay of families whose children may also have been abused.\n\nThe paedophile has always refused to name her victims, leaving many distraught parents in limbo.\n\nLuke Pollard, the Labour MP for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, who has supported many of the affected families, said the photos would upset them.\n\n\u2018The families concerned are facing a life sentence as she spends time relaxing in the sunshine,\u2019 he said.\n\nGeorge (pictured in 2009) was released last month \u2013 much to the dismay of families whose children may also have been abused\n\n\u2018Vanessa George shouldn\u2019t be allowed out of prison until her victims have reached adulthood as a bare minimum. Many of them are now around 12, 13 or 14. The fact she is out is a disgrace when the families are still suffering.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m concerned that, by not naming the victims, she hasn\u2019t shown any remorse.\u2019\n\nGeorge is barely recognisable in the photographs, having lost weight in jail. She had previously weighed 18 stone.\n\nFollowing her release from Send Prison in Surrey, she is living at a bail hostel in Birmingham, preparing for a new life.\n\nBut fellow residents at the probation premises had no idea who George was as she swapped jokes in a courtyard.\n\nA source told The Sun on Sunday: \u2018For the first few days, she was warned to stay on site. No one had a clue who she was until a few days in.\n\n\u2018She spent a lot of time in the yard outside when it was warm, lapping up the sunshine and laughing and joking.\u2019 The source added: \u2018She didn\u2019t come across as the type who\u2019s too troubled by what she was banged up for.\u2019\n\nThe photos show that her hair is now a natural mousey blonde. And she looks relaxed, wearing a navy blue top, grey shorts and black slip-on shoes.\n\nFollowing her release from prison, the mother of one victim wrote a heartbreaking open letter to George. She told how her crimes had left her family with a \u2018legacy of pain\u2019.\n\nThe mother said her child, who has had to have counselling, is aged 13 but still wets the bed and has never had a sleepover at a friend\u2019s house. \u2018It\u2019s not fair that you get to move on now and start a fresh life and we are left to continue suffering,\u2019 she added.\n\nEven George\u2019s own family say that she should not have been released. One member, who did not want to be named, told the Daily Mail: \u2018It might have been easier to just lock her up and throw away the key. She\u2019s clearly not a decent member of society.\u2019\n\nAnother added: \u2018There are so many people down here who feel very strongly about what she did, it\u2019s no wonder they are stopping her from coming back to Devon.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s even served enough time for what she did.\u2019", "description": "Vanessa George, 49, is seen basking in the sun at a bail hostel in Birmingham in the first picture since her controversial release from jail two weeks ago.", "authors": ["Izzy Ferris For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/01/19376074-0-image-a-38_1570406920170.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
