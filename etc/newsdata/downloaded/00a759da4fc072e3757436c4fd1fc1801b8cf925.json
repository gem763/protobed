The contracts don\u2019t necessarily predict movements after the opening bell.\n\nStocks were broadly higher across Asia, with the Shanghai Composite and Japan\u2019s Nikkei both up 0.8%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was an outlier, slipping 0.3%.\n\nThe offshore yuan was up 0.4% against the U.S. dollar. The yuan\u2019s relative weakness has been a source of tension between the countries in recent weeks, with the U.S. accusing China of currency manipulation after a sharp depreciation in the yuan.\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.1% after a German economic institute said a recession is likely in the continent\u2019s largest economy.\n\nInvestors were focused on the European Central Bank\u2019s policy decision due later Thursday, where expectations were high for a stimulus package. Analysts anticipate an interest-rate cut of at least a 10 basis points to its key deposit rate. The policy statement is due at 1:45 p.m. in Frankfurt.\n\n\u201cThe ECB is running out of options to counter the gloom,\u201d said Robert McAdie, chief cross-asset strategist at BNP Paribas .\n\nThere was \u201csome degree of dissent\u201d between decision makers at the ECB about how to press ahead with measures, said David Owen, chief European economist at Jefferies, making it difficult to predict a likely outcome.\n\n\u201cThe slowdown in the eurozone is not about domestic forces but global trade more generally,\u201d Mr. Owen said.\n\nOther efforts from the ECB to support growth may include measures to cushion banks from the impact of negative interest rates, which can put pressure on profits. Many investors were also predicting a return to quantitative easing, by way of restarting the ECB\u2019s asset-purchase program.\n\nThe level of asset purchases, with market expectations set around \u20ac30 billion a month, would be important for investors, said Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\nAnything significantly above that threshold would be regarded as \u201cvery good news\u201d by markets, he said. Holding off on special measures for banks to mitigate the impact of negative interest rates might also appeal to current President Mario Draghi, as he prepares to leave his role and pass on to his expected successor, Christine Lagarde.\n\n\u201cIt will be positive for the market if investors believe that Lagarde still has room for maneuver when she comes in,\u201d Mr. Gimber said. That room could also include further interest-rate cuts, he said.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Sept. 9, 2019.

Germany\u2019s 10-year bund fell to minus 0.581%.\n\nThe U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 1.726%, from 1.733% on Wednesday, after posting three straight days of gains. Bond prices fall as yields rise.\n\nInflation data from the U.S., expected later Thursday, could have an impact on Federal Reserve decision makers ahead of their meeting next week. Recent updates to the consumer-price index from the Labor Department suggested inflation might be making a comeback.\n\nWith strong wage growth reported last month, prices may continue to rebound after a weak start to the year. Excluding volatile sectors like fuel and food, so-called core CPI should have risen 0.2% in August, economists expect.\n\nFigures will also be released on the number of weekly U.S. jobless claims, with an expectation of 216,000, compared with last week\u2019s 217,000.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude dropped 1.2% to $60.07 a barrel. Gold rose 0.5%, extending its climb that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s call for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates to zero. Lower interest rates tend to support the price of the haven metal by making it more competitive with yield-bearing assets like bonds.\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com", "description": "Global stocks wavered ahead of expected stimulus from the European Central Bank, though Asian shares got a boost after the White House delayed extra tariffs on Chinese imports.", "authors": ["Anna Isaac", "Anna.Isaac Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106474/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
