Such platforms have become the lifeblood of the attention-seeking fashion business, a marketing strategy that Gucci built around its star designer Alessandro Michele.\n\nGucci has thrived on social-media exposure until recently.

His fashion shows\u2014including one last year in Milan where models strutted down the runway holding realistic replicas of their own heads\u2014went viral. Mr. Michele\u2019s next show is set for Sept. 22 during Milan fashion week.\n\nThe tide of social media praise turned against Gucci after the $890 sweater. Gucci pulled the sweater, apologized and hired a chief diversity officer, but the brand took a beating on social media. Celebrities posted videos of themselves burning Gucci products and called for boycotts, including rapper T.I., who on Instagram declared himself \u201ca 7 figure/yr customer & long time supporter\u201d of Gucci.\n\nNow, some in the fashion industry are questioning whether Gucci and its designer have peaked.\n\n\u201cAs innovative as Alessandro is, his style is becoming a little bit stagnant,\u201d said Nicole Fischelis, who held positions as fashion director and creative director at Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy\u2019s before starting her own consulting firm.\n\nGucci declined to comment and didn\u2019t make Mr. Michele available. Its parent company, Kering SA, noted that Gucci was the hottest fashion brand in the Lyst Index\u2019s most recent quarterly ranking and is the most searched brand on The RealReal , a luxury resale site.\n\nGucci, which sells everything from $300 wallets to $1,590 sneakers and $5,000 dresses, is particularly susceptible to social media highs and lows because of its large base of younger customers. Morgan Stanley estimates that more than two-thirds of Gucci sales comes from millennials.\n\nGucci dialed back U.S. marketing last quarter rather than draw more attention to itself in the middle of the blackface maelstrom, Jean-Marc Duplaix, chief financial officer at Kering, said in July. Gucci contributes about 60% of Kering\u2019s revenue and 80% of profit.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to assess the evolution of the U.S. market, the reaction of the consumers after the issue we had in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Duplaix said, adding that Gucci is readying a marketing push in the U.S. later this year. Kering\u2019s shares are down about 10% since reporting the 2% decline in North American sales in late July.\n\nThe company also has said shifts in tourism flows\u2014more Americans traveling and shopping abroad and fewer Europeans and Asians visiting the U.S.\u2014contributed to the drop in North American sales. The region accounts for 20% of Gucci\u2019s sales.\n\nGucci has courted hip-hop artists like Lil Pump, seen performing in Paris in 2018; this year, social-media influencers burned Gucci products and called for boycotts, prompted by a sweater that looked like blackface.

Chanel benefited from the social media buzz surrounding the death in February of its longtime designer, Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nGucci\u2019s earned media value fell by a third in March from the previous month to $30.7 million. Chanel, which had an earned media value of $33.8 million in March, held the top spot again in April, lost it in May to Gucci and then won it back again in June with the two companies almost tied.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Which luxury brands have you been seeing come up on social media lately? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe drop in Gucci\u2019s North American sales comes on the heels of four quarters of declining growth and tracks the brand\u2019s waning social media strength. Gucci in September 2017 hit an earned media value of $82.5 million, triple the $27 million it reached in July of this year, according to Tribe Dynamics. In the September 2017 quarter, Gucci sales rose 49% in North America.\n\nGucci is far from the only brand to stumble on social media, especially when it comes to race and other hot-button issues. Prada pulled from shelves a monkey keychain that was called out as racially insensitive, saying, \u201cThe resemblance of the products to blackface was by no means intentional, but we recognize that this does not excuse the damage they have caused.\u201d Versace, meanwhile, has apologized for releasing a T-shirt that identified Hong Kong and Macau as separate from China.\n\nWrite to Eric Sylvers at eric.sylvers@wsj.com and Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com", "description": "The Gucci brand soared as it forged connections with hip-hop artists and streetwear influencers on Instagram and other platforms\u2014but when it brought out a sweater likened to blackface, the momentum reversed.", "authors": ["Eric Sylvers", "Suzanne Kapner", "Eric.Sylvers Wsj.Com", "Suzanne.Kapner Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106760/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
