Another said he believed Ator would \u201cattempt to harm the police and the public.\u201d\n\nWhen police arrived, they found Ator had dug an underground bunker in his back yard, had a machete in his bed and had made plans for a potential attack.\n\nThis evidence led them to record the home\u2019s floor plan and hand it over to the local SWAT team.\n\nIn 2011, police took Ator to a hospital after his home inspection was complete, where he was given medication and admitted to a treatment center for mental health.\n\nA third police officer noted that Ator mentioned to security that \u201cthe police can\u2019t be everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took this as a threat against the public,\u201d the officer wrote.\n\nThese new reports come after Ator opened fire during a routine traffic stop in September, leading to a 10-mile rampage that killed seven people and injured dozens more before he was gunned down and killed outside an Odessa movie theater.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
