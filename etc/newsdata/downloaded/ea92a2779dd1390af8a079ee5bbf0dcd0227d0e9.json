We stayed with a Mrs White in her farmhouse. My mother had knitted me woollen bathing trunks and as soon as I stood up in the water they fell around my ankles. There were snails in the farmhouse garden and Mrs White paid me a penny a snail to catch them. I collected hundreds in a bucket and bought a beach cricket set with the cash.\n\nBest travel companion?\n\nThe best people to travel with are strangers you meet when you get there.\n\nWorst Holiday?\n\nCorfu in the early Eighties. The beach was huge pebbles covered in beer cans and cigarette ends. There was a plague of horseflies and the discos were blaring all night. There was no way to cool down our little apartment \u2014 and halfway through the holiday my girlfriend dumped me.\n\nFavourite holiday?\n\nLouis remembers his favourite holiday to Normandy, pictured above\n\nThe place I\u2019ve loved most was a bit of woodland in Normandy with a freshwater spring so pure there were shrimps in the water. I found it by chance up a dirt track when I was looking for a place to camp.\n\nBest place to take children?\n\nThe Isle of Wight. I go there every year with my son Robin, 13, and daughter Sophie, ten. The whole island is geared up for children.\n\nWhere to avoid?\n\nI avoid the most popular places in summer but I\u2019ll go there in spring or autumn.", "description": "Captain Corelli author Louis de Bernieres talks about a hellish holiday in Corfu, why the Isle of Wight is the best place to take children - and more...", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/14/11/18472270-0-image-a-29_1568456164127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
