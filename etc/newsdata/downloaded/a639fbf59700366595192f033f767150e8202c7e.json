C.S.A.\u201d\n\nConfederate States of America, that means. Right here in Maryland, though the state never seceded from the United States. Right here in front of the courthouse, the first and most prominent sight that greets anyone arriving to seek justice and law in Talbot County.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little bit imposing to be on the courthouse grounds, to me,\u201d Herr said as he first saw the statue in person. \u201cThat\u2019s a more North Carolina, Virginia statue. Not Maryland. Not in my own backyard.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHerr\u2019s goal, tonight, was to convince the Talbot County Council that this long-standing statue doesn\u2019t belong.\n\nHerr is on a one-man quest to remove Confederate monuments wherever he finds them in Maryland, the state where he was born and raised. The Catonsville resident has already succeeded one time, persuading a veterans\u2019 retirement home in St. Mary\u2019s County to take down a plaque. The Eastern Shore\u2019s \u201cTalbot Boys,\u201d erected in memory of the dozens of residents of this county who fought for the Confederacy (while others, not honored in stone, fought for the Union), is next on his growing to-do list.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you have monuments on the courthouse grounds and kids walk by it, I don\u2019t know how they don\u2019t feel like the values of the Confederacy are still what the world likes,\u201d he said.\n\nHerr, who is 29 and white, knows that when he shows up at public forums and meets with government officials, he might seem like a somewhat unexpected face of the long-running movement against these statues. He\u2019s cognizant of the white men like him who have marched in defense of Confederate statues and the African American activists who have made the case against these monuments long before he got involved. He\u2019s also very aware of his privilege as a white man and said he hopes perhaps to make use of it in service to this cause.\n\nAD\n\nHis interest was sparked in a class he took on Civil War history at University of Maryland-Baltimore County, where he studied computer science.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great \u2014 it\u2019s inspiring, actually \u2014 that here\u2019s someone who has taken what he learned in a class and is running with it and is willing to expend the time and energy to change what he thinks is wrong,\u201d said Anne Sarah Rubin, who was the professor of the class and has advised Herr over the past few months in his search for Maryland monuments to take on.\n\nHerr was in Rubin\u2019s class shortly after the 2017 violence in Charlottesville, when what began as a demonstration in favor of keeping a Confederate monument on its pedestal ended in a young woman\u2019s death. Rubin told her students that her own opinion had changed. \u201cWhat happened in Charlottesville, that really awful juxtaposition of Confederate flags and Nazi emblems, I think it pushed me,\u201d she recalls saying. \u201cWhat these monuments symbolize, just by their mere existence they\u2019re showing some sort of community sanction. And they need to come down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the days after Charlottesville, many Marylanders also came to agree with Rubin\u2019s point of view. Baltimore hauled away four Confederate statues in the dead of night. A statue of a Supreme Court justice who defended slavery came down in Annapolis.\n\nAD\n\nBut Maryland \u2014 a state that still had slavery when the Civil War began but did not join the Confederacy \u2014 still has a few monuments to the Confederacy standing.\n\nHerr started making a list. After what he describes as a contentious meeting with the state secretary of veterans affairs, he prevailed with the plaque at the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home. He wanted more.\n\nHe had the time to devote. Herr has overcome a lot: A decade ago, he was hospitalized for mental illness, then stayed in a homeless shelter. When he started researching Confederate statues, he was out of work, receiving disability benefits.\n\nAD\n\nThree months ago, he got married. This week, he got a job at last, in the technology industry. In the interview, he was asked what he did as a hobby. \u201cTrying to take down Confederate monuments,\u201d he answered. He says he\u2019ll still have time to pursue his quest once he starts working.\n\nAD\n\nHe wants those who say that removing monuments is undoing history to understand just how recent many of them are. That plaque that he got taken down at Charlotte Hall was installed in 1993. A statue of Robert E. Lee at Antietam, which is on his list of targets, was dedicated in 2003. Even now, as monuments come down in some cities, new ones keep going up.\n\nHe has spent hours researching: listing where at least seven remaining Maryland monuments are, mostly near battlefields; trying to figure out who\u2019s responsible for them and how to contact that organization; tracking previous, unsuccessful attempts to take them down.\n\nAD\n\nThe Talbot Boys are currently at the top of his list.\n\nAD\n\nHe had written to the county council, with little result. So on Tuesday, when the council met, he drove down from his home in Catonsville, arriving almost three hours early. He was the first to put his name down on the neon-green sign-in sheet for public comment, the time when any Marylander can speak his piece on any subject, as long as he talks for less than three minutes.\n\nHe went over what he planned to say: His blunt message that the statue implies the county endorses white supremacy. (\u201cI toyed with how to word that,\u201d he says. His wife, Jessica, convinced him: \u201cWhy not just call it what it is?\u201d) His offer to personally pay to remove the statue or install a plaque putting it in context. (He emailed a company that makes bronze plaques for a price quote, and thinks it would cost $400. He talked that one over with Jessica too. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a lot,\u201d he said with a slight sigh. \u201cBut we don\u2019t really need a lot.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nFor an hour and a half, he listened to the business of the county council \u2014 the tourism report, the zoning amendment. And then at long last, the council\u2019s president, Corey Pack, called his name. Paper shaking slightly in his hands, Herr read his prepared statement: \u201cThe people who fought for the Confederacy do not deserve to have their values exemplified and glorified,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThen, apologizing nervously for the language, he said he wanted them to know what the Confederacy truly stood for, in the words of its own vice president \u2014 words widely circulated around the country at the time: \u201cOur new government \u2026 its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. \u2026 This, our new government, is the first in the history of the world based upon this great physical, philosophical and moral truth.\u201d\n\nThe council members listened but didn\u2019t say a word. The buzzer rang. His time was up. Herr stepped down, and four more speakers followed. All of them talked about the county\u2019s proposal for a new recycling center.\n\nAD\n\nHalf an hour later, they were still debating. \u201cWho knew recycling would be so much more contentious than my issue,\u201d Herr muttered.\n\nAD\n\nThen it was on to traffic from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Then 911 infrastructure. And then it was all over. Herr had driven all this way, sat stock-still through all these other topics, and no one had even acknowledged him at all. He stood to leave.\n\nCouncil member Pete Lesher tapped him on the shoulder. And, finally, Herr got to plead his case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me. I\u2019m not part of a group. I\u2019ll work with whoever. Whatever I can do to try to advance this, if you have any ideas,\u201d Herr said, and Lesher answered, \u201cThe one thing I cannot promise is a quick solution. I think we need time to build the consensus.\u201d\n\nHerr didn\u2019t want to be patient. He pointed out that Talbot County had debated this question at length before, and nothing had changed. \u201cThis is one of the last in Maryland,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nHe kept pressing. In the end, Lesher promised to talk to others about the issue, including the head of the local NAACP branch. His final sentence to Herr was, \u201cNot everyone appreciates you raising this issue, but I appreciate you raising the issue.\u201d\n\nHerr walked out the door, past the statue again. He spared only a passing glance for the towering sculpture of a Confederate going off to battle, as he rushed in the rain down the red-brick path. One May day in 1774, two years before the Declaration of Independence, other determined young men had gathered on this same lawn, to express their own resolve to fight the looming unjust power of their day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad there\u2019s movement, at least. I haven\u2019t hit a brick wall yet,\u201d Herr said. \u201cSo I\u2019ll keep going.\u201d", "description": "This white 29-year-old has made it his mission to make his state face its history.", "authors": ["Julie Zauzmer", "Reporter Covering Religion", "Faith"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_ObyTbdvwMhfkQRUm9jGlMLuDUw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LN7P7XXXIEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
