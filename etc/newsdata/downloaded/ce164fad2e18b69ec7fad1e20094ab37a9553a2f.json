Bloomberg News previously reported Blackstone was in talks to buy and lease back the Bellagio and MGM Grand. The property is being purchased by the Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust.\n\nMGM will use the proceeds to bolster its balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. Mr Murren said the transactions would help the company target new growth opportunities, including one of the new integrated resource licences in Japan and sports betting in the United States. MGM has no plans to develop more casinos in Las Vegas, he said.\n\nEarlier deals\n\nMr Ruffin, a real estate mogul raised in Wichita, Kansas, will pay $US662.5 million ($983.9 million) in cash for Circus Circus. The $US162.5 million ($241.3 million) balance will be in a note that's due in 2024. The parties expected to deal to close in the fourth quarter. The resort has 2300 employees and includes an eight-hectare RV park and 15-hectare festival grounds.\n\nMr Ruffin bought the Treasure Island casino from MGM for $US746 million ($1.1 billion) in 2009. The company then was trying to raise cash following the financial crisis and complete construction of its CityCenter project.\n\nHe fixed up Treasure Island, once known for its daily pirate battles outside, adding a western-themed barbecue restaurant and other amenities aimed at Middle American guests. Earlier, he partnered with Donald Trump on the Trump International Hotel, a non-casino hotel and condo development on the Strip.\n\nCircus Circus, now more than 50 years old, was once a flagship property of publicly traded Circus Circus Enterprises. MGM ultimately acquired that company. The resort itself is located at the less-trafficked north end of the Strip.\n\nThe sale of Bellagio will provide a benchmark value to attract bidders for MGM's remaining real estate interests, Mr Murren said, including the CityCenter properties that are co-owned with Dubai World, and the flagship MGM Grand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Murren also said he was not concerned that Penn National Gaming Corp., another casino operator that had moved to a similar asset-light strategy, trades at a lower multiple of earnings than other casino companies. He said MGM's assets make it unique.\n\nMGM Resorts enlisted Weil, Gotshal & Manges as its legal counsel, while PJT Partners and JPMorgan Chase & Co. served as financial advisers. Blackstone's REIT used Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley as its financial advisers. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, meanwhile, was its legal counsel.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "MGM Resorts International has also agreed to sell Circus Circus on the Las Vegas Strip, moving a step closer to becoming a landless casino company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_81/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ed0442d994be58f0ff49c8ed89df0cf62b5a4128", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
