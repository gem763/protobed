Plot details were released today, and it sounds kind-of like what would\u2019ve happened if Ben Stiller had simply shotgunned all the exhibits in Night at the Museum the instant they came to life.\n\nIn Wally\u2019s Wonderland, Cage will play a janitor at a theme park that has a \u201cdark secret.\u201d When he is forced to spend the night in the park, his character is \u201cdrawn into a living nightmare,\u201d where there \u201cthreatening animatronic characters come to life,\u201d and he then has to \u201cfight his way from one monster to another to survive until morning and get out of the park.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the fucken Warriors meets Five Nights At Freddie\u2019s, and it sounds demented and awesome.\n\nREAD MORE What Happens When TikTok Stops Being A Haven For Weirdo Creatives?\n\nAs if it weren\u2019t good enough as is, the titular Wally in question happens to be the film\u2019s antagonist, who will be accompanied by a roaming gang of \u201cpsychopathic misfits.\u201d\n\nThe script for the film previously landed on the Blood List, which is akin to the much higher-profile Black List of most-hyped unproduced screenplays, but specifically for high concept genre films like this.\n\nThere are no other details available about the film at this time, but whatever it winds up being you can just straight-up hook it to my damned veins.", "description": "Nic Cage has reportedly signed on to play the lead role in a wild-sounding new movie that will see him bash haunted animatronic theme park creatures.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/nic-cage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
