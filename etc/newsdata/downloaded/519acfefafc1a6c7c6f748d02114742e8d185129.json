And, although they may not always admit it, there are potentially botox, fillers and injectables in the mix too.\n\nBut unless you're Jennifer Lopez, having exclusive trainers, personal chefs and dermatologists on call probably isn't attainable. So how do we get that swoon worthy, wrinkle free, fountain of youth look of the stars without making an appointment with a cosmetic specialist?\n\nThen Vs Now: Jennifer Lopez looks ageless when comparing her 2000 Grammy Awards appearance in that Versace dress (left) to her runway moment for Versace in 2019 (right)\n\nThis is where Australia's first anti-aging skin care treatment stick comes into play: the WRINKLE BLOCK Age Prevention Multi Stick from freezeframe is the beauty alternative of dreams and has women all over the country seeing results in as little as seven days!\n\n'My eye bags disappeared from sight,' says one woman who participated in freezeframe's clinical trial.\n\nAccording to another: 'My eyes, and whole face look fresh and awake \u2013 even when I\u2019m dead tired!'\n\nBlock them out: WRINKLE BLOCK is Australia's first anti-aging skin care treatment in a fast, convenient and easy to use stick format\n\nEven freezeframe founder Sonia Amoroso was blown away by the results from the initial trials: 'To say we were shocked would be an understatement.'\n\nThis nifty little stick is ideal for crow's feet, frown lines, smile lines and marionette lines (the ones near your mouth and chin), and can even freshen up the entire face, and reduce puffiness under the eyes by up to 76% in just seven days with a near 40% wrinkle reduction in the same time period.\n\nGoodbye fine lines: In just 28 days, WRINKLE BLOCK delivers an impressive long term wrinkle reduction of 60% less visible wrinkles in 28 days.\n\nAnd because it comes in stick form, it provides a targeted and hygienic application perfect for busy lifestyles - saving you the time, money and pain that comes with using botox and other cosmetic procedures.\n\nWhat's more, there is no paralysing of the facial muscles as can often happen with injectables, which can actually cause long term muscle wastage, potentially leading to sunken or sagging skin.\n\nAlways-youthful Michelle Williams is considered to have some of the best skin in Hollywood\n\nWhat to expect from WRINKLE BLOCK Blocks expression wrinkles by up to 78% in 30 minutes, without paralysing muscles, and is completely reversible in 48 hours\n\nReduces wrinkles by almost 40% in seven days, with 60% less visible wrinkles in 28 days\n\nReduces eye bags and puffiness by up to 76% in 7 days\n\nWith TWO powerful peptides, it slows down the movement creating wrinkle creases and gives skin the energy to bounce back\n\nConvenient, fast and hygienic stick format for on-the-go lifestyles\n\nBut how exactly does it work?\n\nWRINKLE BLOCK uses two powerful peptides to slow down the movements which create wrinkle creases, while at the same time charging the skin with the energy it needs to bounce back from the damage the expression leaves in the skin.\n\nNeed some clarification on the terms? Peptides are short chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, and are found in every cell and tissue in the human body, performing a wide range of essential functions.\n\nThe freezeframe scientists discovered that arranging amino acids in a very specific order could deliver two targeted actions in the skin.\n\nCrow's feet and eye bags are dramatically reduced by almost 40% and 76% respectively in seven days\n\nFirstly, they can block up to 78% of expression wrinkles in 30 minutes - with WRINKLE BLOCK peptide relaxers being 10 times more effective than previous wrinkle relaxers. Basically this means expression lines are eliminated before they even begin!\n\nAnd secondly, it acts as a battery pack for your skin. Wrinkles don't just 'appear', they are the result of years of expression trauma and a constant depletion of the energy your skin needs in order to bounce back.\n\nWhen we're younger skin bounces back pretty quickly, but from the age of about 25, the skin loses the energy it needs to fight off wrinkles. WRINKLE BLOCK is able to slow down the process of skin movement whilst simultaneously energising skin, giving you smooth skin, radiant enough to rival that of a Hollywood A-lister.\n\nShine bright like the Hollywood stars without filler, botox or injectables by using WRINKLE BLOCK to block out expression lines by 78% in just 30 minutes\n\nAt an affordable $69 you don't need a movie star budget to get the wrinkle-free complexion of your dreams. Although you could try JLo's strategy of repeating positive affirmations to keep herself 'ageless', WRINKLE BLOCK is an affordable and effective option.", "description": "SPONSORED", "authors": ["Alice Piper For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/05/20115496-0-image-a-10_1571890952240.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
