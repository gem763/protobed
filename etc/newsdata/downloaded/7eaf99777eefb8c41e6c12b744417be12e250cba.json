His justification, that MPs\u2019 attempts to secure scrutiny and prevent a disastrous no-deal Brexit are undermining his efforts to secure a deal, does not stand up to scrutiny.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNo such deal is in the offing. Indeed, Johnson has not even attempted to secure a new deal, nor an amended version of Theresa May\u2019s deal.\n\nMany of his own party have had enough. Philip Hammond says Johnson is talking \u201cnonsense\u201d, that the \u201cUK government has tabled no proposals\u201d, and that there are no alternative arrangements for the backstop, or even a UK negotiating team.\n\nI am in earnest agreement with the former chancellor and even find myself siding with Dominic Cummings, who has been reported describing EU negotiations as \u201ca sham\u201d in internal strategy meetings.\n\nI have been in contact with many political correspondents, MPs and MEPs about UK government efforts to reach agreement with the European Union. Publicly confirmed, these amount to: three contacts in June, two phone calls between Jean-Claude Juncker and Johnson since he became prime minister, and the current presence of David Frost in Brussels. With the latter indicating that the United Kingdom will not press for a technical extension to Article 50, which would be required if some concrete progress on a deal had been made, the government\u2019s intention to crash us out of the European Union is readily apparent. The bluster and bad faith shown by Johnson\u2019s government are nothing more than a smokescreen, seeking to crash us out of the European Union by any means.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Operation Yellowhammer leaks echo the warnings from industry leaders, healthcare and scientific bodies and professional associations that have been so strident, and so studiously ignored by the government over the past three years.\n\nNo amount of massaging the government\u2019s own impact assessment can disguise the catastrophic impact of no-deal Brexit on our jobs and livelihoods. Despite officials working through the weekend to whitewash Yellowhammer, the cabinet has decided that even a heavily sanitised impact assessment is not sufficiently optimistic. So the intention now is for no document to be published at all!\n\nOpposition MPs working to avoid a disastrous no deal, far from undermining the prime minister, are offering him time to do what he says he intends to do \u2013 secure a deal for the United Kingdom, helping to resolve the constitutional crisis his actions over the past week have created.\n\nAt some point, a deal will be required, whether that is one earnestly negotiated anew by our government, and agreed after full consideration by parliament, or the best possible deal that we currently enjoy with the European Union. It is only reasonable that either option be put to a people\u2019s vote, so that a decision may be reached with clarity and an understanding of the destination in mind.\n\nAnything else will simply deepen the divisions the Conservatives have torn in our fatigued and fractured society.\n\nTom Brake is MP for Carshalton and Wallington and Brexit spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats", "description": "On Monday, Boris Johnson stated that he would not be seeking an election.", "authors": ["Tom Brake"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/01/16/boris-johnson.jpg"}
