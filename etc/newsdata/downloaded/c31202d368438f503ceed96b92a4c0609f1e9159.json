Now Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s quest to give the definitive portrayal of Princess Margaret in the forthcoming series of The Crown has led her to track down a lock of the Princess\u2019s hair\n\nIt was during one of the Princess\u2019s hour-long appointments with Guillemet in the early 1970s that he asked if he could keep a lock of her hair.\n\n\u2018Madame Tussauds wanted to make a wax model of her,\u2019 he tells me. \u2018They asked me what colour her hair was.\u2019\n\nBy chance, Princess Margaret \u2014 accompanied, as always, by a detective \u2014 was that day coming into the salon which he shared with his colleagues Josef Braunschweig and David Andrews, who were responsible for cutting the royal mane.\n\n\u2018I asked her: \u201cCan I keep a lock of your hair?\u201d and she said: \u201cFine.\u201d\n\nThis personal memento is, I can disclose, in the possession of Jean Pierre Guillemet, who tells me that he coloured the Princess\u2019s hair \u2018from 1969 until she passed away\u2019 17 years ago\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t normally collect hair,\u2019 adds Guillemet, who keeps the lock at home but brought it into the Ozzie Rizzo salon in London\u2019s Mayfair \u2014 where he, Braunschweig and Andrews now work \u2014 so that Bonham Carter could see it. \u2018She was absolutely delightful, absolutely adorable, very great fun.\n\n\u2018She had a team of people from The Crown \u2014 the make-up artist and people like that. They were quite intrigued that I had a bit of Princess Margaret\u2019s hair.\u2019 But Guillemet is aware that the lock isn\u2019t an infallible guide. \u2018Like all natural hair, it fades,\u2019 he explains.\n\nHe adds that when Bonham Carter, 53, appears on screen, her hair will be as close to the \u2018rich brown\u2019 favoured by Princess Margaret as it could possibly be.\n\n\u2018It was fine, when it was done. I had the formula and used the same products; it\u2019s much easier like that.\u2019\n\nBonham Carter and her make-up artist picked up one more tip before they left . . .\n\n\u2018They learned how to put tiaras on,\u2019 adds Guillemet.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Bonham Carter and her make-up artist picked up one more tip before they left . . .\n\nIt's not often you see a Bond girl dressed as 007\n\nBond co-star is licensed to thrill as 007\u2019s double\n\nIt's not often you see a Bond girl dressed as 007.\n\nAna de Armas, who stars in the forthcoming No Time To Die, eschewed the customary glamorous dress in favour of a black tuxedo and bow-tie for a film premiere in London this week. \u2018Straight from the set of James Bond to the Knives Out premiere, almost impossible to do,\u2019 said the Cuban actress, adding she was \u2018in love\u2019 with her Alexandre Vauthier suit.\n\nOne person not on the red carpet at the BFI London Film Festival was her Knives Out co-star (and 007) Daniel Craig.\n\nJust as well. Their outfits would have clashed.\n\nWhen the BBC dropped Jeremy Clarkson after he punched a producer in a row over a cold dinner, it lost a licence to print money.\n\nFor Clarkson and his fellow petrolheads, Richard Hammond and James May, helped generate \u00a331.7 million in sales last year at the company which makes their show, The Grand Tour.\n\nNewly published accounts for their business, W. Chump and Sons, reveal that the presenters and their director, Andy Wilman, shared a \u00a32.1 million payout.\n\nThe quartet were also paid a basic salary of \u00a3150,000 a year each.\n\nUnder-fire Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson has boosted his bank balance to the tune of \u00a320,000 by penning a book about his weight loss.\n\nThe MP, who is facing calls to resign for his role in the VIP sex abuse inquiry, has been signed up by the same literary agency that represents J. K. Rowling, the Blair Partnership. Watson spent the summer penning the story of his 8st weight drop.\n\nAnd in a new entry published on the MPs\u2019 official Register Of Financial Interests, the 52-year-old has declared receiving \u00a319,325 for his work writing the memoir.\n\nYoung models obsessed with social media might want to heed veteran mannequin Jacquetta Wheeler. She warns an infatuation with Instagram ruins the fun.\n\n\u2018Where we used to be focused on the job and the atmosphere, we\u2019re now constantly thinking about how it will be perceived by other people,\u2019 she tells me.\n\n\u2018That means you\u2019re not actually present in what you\u2019re doing. It takes the enjoyment away.\u2019\n\nConde Nast chairman Nicholas Coleridge admits that using older women on magazine covers sees sales plummet.\n\n\u2018I remember we had four or five quite well-known women in their early 40s [on the cover],\u2019 he told Cheltenham Literary Festival.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m thinking of Norma Major, who was the first. We put her on the cover of Tatler but it completely bombed.\u2019\n\nDespite starring in the new campaign for Marc Jacobs beauty, unveiled this week, Kate Moss\u2019s daughter Lila admits her mother has instructed her to go easy on the warpaint\n\nDespite starring in the new campaign for Marc Jacobs beauty, unveiled this week, Kate Moss\u2019s daughter Lila admits her mother has instructed her to go easy on the warpaint.\n\n\u2018The best advice Mum has given me about make-up is less is more, especially when it comes to foundation and bronzer,\u2019 says the 17-year-old, whose father is magazine publisher Jefferson Hack.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped her from offering her own tips to the supermodel.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve taught her how to apply highlighter in the right places,\u2019 she adds.\n\n\u2018Once, I noticed she did it completely wrong, so I had to correct it.\u2019\n\nTwice-married model-turned-publican Jodie Kidd wouldn\u2019t shy away from walking up the aisle a third time.\n\n\u2018I would get married a third, fourth or fifth or as many times as I want,\u2019 the 41-year-old told me at a Specsavers party.\n\nDespite being a supporter of equal rights, she said she would never get down on bended knee.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think so \u2014 that is up to the boys.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s hope her boyfriend Joseph Bates, 33, is listening.", "description": "Helena Bonham Carter's quest to give the definitive portrayal of Princess Margaret in the forthcoming series of The Crown has led her to track down a lock of the Princess's hair.", "authors": ["Sebastian Shakespeare For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/00/19517276-0-image-a-12_1570664545502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
