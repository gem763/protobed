Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who criticized him for referring to the small-dollar fundraising strategy championed by candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as \u201cpocket change.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go from mayor of South Bend to a competitive presidential candidate without knowing a thing or two about grassroots campaigning,\u201d he said. \u201cMy campaign is fueled by the contributions of almost 600,000 individual donors. And most of those are small contributions.\u201d\n\nBut he also pointed out that President Trump and his allies brought in $125 million in the most recent fundraising quarter.\n\n\u201cThey will pull out all of the stops to stay in power,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we have a responsibility to the country to make sure that we go into this fight, as Democrats, with everything that we\u2019ve got, and not unilaterally disarming.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s campaign recently said she plans to stick to her plan of not holding \u201chigh-dollar\u201d fundraisers in the general election if she is ultimately the nominee, but that she will raise money for the Democratic National Committee and state and local parties.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
