The photo shows the fire as it devoured the skeleton of a home in Healdsburg, Sonoma County\n\nThe image he shot shows the flames and the remnant structure of the burning house combining to create what appears to be the face of a young girl.\n\n\u2018This was weird because it was pieces of the house and smoke that kinda made that shape,\u2019 Edelson said.\n\n\u2018Often when a home is burning I\u2019ll shoot in rapid fire mode.\n\n\u2018Sometimes there\u2019ll be like one frame where the flames make the shape of an animal or ghost or weird thing.\u2019\n\nWhen he saw the photograph, he hesitated before publishing it, thinking that it could all be in his head.\n\n\u2018I wasn\u2019t sure if it was just my imagination,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018I see this but I don\u2019t know if other people will see it.\u2019\n\nEdelson said that after news agencies decided to publish his other pictures, he would post the spooky girl photo on his social media.\n\nThe Mill Valley, California, native said that this is the \u2018third or fourth time\u2019 that strange and unusual shapes showed up in pictures he has taken of wildfires.", "description": "Photojournalist Josh Edelson, 41, was on assignment taking pictures of the fire as it devoured the skeleton of a home in Healdsburg, California, on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20292876-0-image-a-2_1572288616034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
