As Kelley hilariously notes in his Townhall political cartoon, a distraught donkey symbolizing the Democratic Party says to a therapist, \"Bolton's firing has me conflicted between my visceral contempt for everything he represented and my compulsive need to criticize Trump no matter what...\"\n\nIndeed, Bolton previously played a key role in the Iraq War and other United States foreign policy interventions. Reports say he routinely was trying to get Trump and the U.S. into new entanglements. But, leftists hate Trump. So how can they criticize Trump?

Murphy's hypocrisy, \"Maybe I'm a simpleton but it seems like if you criticized Bolton's hiring you probably shouldn't also criticize his firing.\"\n\nMaybe I'm a simpleton but it seems like if you criticized Bolton's hiring you probably shouldn't also criticize his firing. pic.twitter.com/iRIGNDc28A \u2014 Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) September 10, 2019\n\nAs for why Bolton was fired, Katie covered that White House spokesmen told the press it was due to a variety of reasons.", "description": ".09/12/2019 19:39:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/bcaa56a2-88e5-4a89-bb34-6fb2cf80a0c2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
