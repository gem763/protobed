Here\u2019s Why!", "language": "en", "text": "PARTNER\n\nIndia\u2019s true-blue cricket fanbase needs no introduction! The sport transcends every social and cultural barrier and unifies people like no other. The cricket fever peaks at an all-time-high during IPL and World Cup, and the josh knows no bounds. For those of you who aren\u2019t keeping track, the much-awaited World Cup season is just around the corner.\n\nTourism Australia\n\nThis time around, not one but two World Cups are coming up - for men as well as women. Australia, whose passion for cricket is equally unmissable, is the host nation for the ICC T20 World Cup. What\u2019s more? Australia is determined to make every cricket lovers dream come true, as the finals of both these tournaments will be held at the largest cricket stadium in the world, the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\n\nTourism Australia\n\nTrue fans will agree, nothing comes close to the adrenaline rush and roaring enthusiasm that one experiences while watching a match at the stadium. Now imagine watching a World Cup Final at the world\u2019s largest cricket stadium, hopefully cheering for our men and women in blue. I\u2019m having goosebumps already!\n\nThe action will kick start right at the beginning of the New Year, with women leading the way. The Women\u2019s edition of the ICC T20 World Cup will commence on 21st February with India taking on Australia in the opening match. One would not want to miss out on being a part of this iconic tournament, which is also attempting to set a new world record of highest attendance for a women\u2019s sporting fixture at its finals, which is scheduled to coincide with International Women\u2019s Day on 8 March.\n\nTourism Australia\n\nBelieve me, there\u2019s no better opportunity than this to show our love and passion towards our women cricketers.\n\nThe latter half of the year will witness the men battle it out at the ICC T20 World Cup scheduled from 18th October to 15th November 2020. As the tournament coincides with the Diwali holidays, Australia is set to welcome Indian cricket enthusiasts in large numbers.\n\nI mean, let\u2019s ditch the usual sight-seeing stay-home vacays, and make our 2020 vacation as big and exciting as it gets. In addition to witnessing the world\u2019s best cricketers play world-class cricket on one hand and can also indulge in a range of distinct experiences in Australia. From nightlife, wildlife to sceneries, name a thing and Australia\u2019s got it!\n\nTourism Australia\n\nWhat\u2019s more? The Australian Department of Home Affairs is also offering Indian travellers a facility to lodge their visa applications online, thereby eliminating the need for personal interviews, biometrics, and physical submissions of passport and financial documents. If this is not a blessing then I don\u2019t know what is!\n\nWith so much action to look forward to both in and around the stadiums, and plenty of exciting packages on offer, it is no surprise that all roads in 2020 will indeed lead to Australia. For now, I\u2019m super pumped up about ICC Women\u2019s World Cup 2020.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Buzz your friends and family, plan the vacation and make your bookings well in time!", "description": "This time around, not one but two World Cups are coming up - for men as well as women.
