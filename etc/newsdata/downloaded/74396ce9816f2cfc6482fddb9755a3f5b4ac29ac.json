The judge also ordered Huffman to pay a $30,000 fine and complete 250 hours of community service.\n\n\u201cMy first apology is to you,\u201d Huffman told the judge immediately before the sentence was issued.\n\n\u201cI realise now as a mother that love and truth must go hand in hand, and love at the expense of truth is not real love,\u201d the actress said. \u201cI will deserve whatever punishment you give me,\u201d she added.\n\nHuffman was released from court after the judge ordered her to report to prison on Oct. 25.\n\nProsecutors had recommended a sentence of one month behind bars after Huffman tearfully entered a guilty plea in May to conspiracy related to her payment of $15,000 to have someone secretly correct her daughter\u2019s answers on the SAT standardized test used for college admissions.\n\nU.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling had also recommended a $20,000 fine and one year of probation.\n\nHuffman\u2019s attorneys, calling the actress \u201cremorseful\u201d and \u201cdeeply ashamed,\u201d had urged the judge to allow her to remain free on one year\u2019s probation, complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $20,000 fine.\n\nHuffman and her husband, actor William H. Macy, looked sombre when they arrived at the federal courthouse, holding hands, ahead of the sentencing.\n\nHuffman is among 51 people charged in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents were accused of conspiring to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure for their children admission to prominent U.S. universities. These schools included Yale, Stanford, Georgetown, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas and Wake Forest.\n\nMore than 30 parents were charged in the investigation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues, also including actress Lori Loughlin, who starred in the TV series \u201cFull House,\u201d and her designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, as well as a host of corporate executives, financiers and lawyers. Unlike Huffman, Loughlin and Giannulli pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe scandal cast a spotlight on the advantages of wealth in college admissions and the lengths to which some rich Americans have gone to get their children into top universities at the expense of other applicants.\n\nActress Felicity Huffman arrives at the federal courthouse with her husband William H.

Singer\u2019s sentencing is set for later this month.\n\n\u2018MY OWN INTEGRITY\u2019\n\nHuffman, who won an Emmy award for \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d and was nominated for an Oscar as best actress for her role in the 2005 film \u201cTransamerica,\u201d said the cheating scheme was proposed by Singer.\n\nHuffman said her daughter Sophia was unaware of the scheme until the actress was arrested on March 12. The actress said her daughter was 4 years old when Huffman first started trying to help her deal with learning disabilities.\n\n\u201cI find Motherhood bewildering,\u201d Huffman said in a letter to the judge before sentencing.\n\n\u201cMy daughter looked at me and asked with tears streaming down her face, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u2019 ... I have compromised my daughter\u2019s future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity,\u201d Huffman said in her letter.\n\nMacy, 69, said their daughter \u201ccertainly paid the dearest price\u201d when her desired school - which remained unnamed in court documents - rescinded its acceptance of her after Huffman\u2019s arrest. Macy was not charged.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\n\u201cShe had been accepted into a few schools but her heart was set on one in particular which, ironically, doesn\u2019t require SAT scores,\u201d Macy said in a letter to the judge.\n\n\u201cShe started as one of several thousand applicants and after making it through many auditions, she flew to the school two days after her mom\u2019s arrest for the final selections. When she landed, the school emailed her withdrawing their invitation to audition,\u201d Macy said.\n\nProsecutors had told the judge it was important that the sentence include time behind bars.\n\n\u201cIncarceration ... would provide just punishment for the offence, make it clear that this was a real crime, causing real harm, and reinforce the vital principle that all are equally subject to the law regardless of wealth or position,\u201d Lelling said in pre-sentencing documents.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman, the first parent sentenced in a wide-ranging U.S. college admissions cheating scandal, was given a 14-day prison term and apologised for her actions on Friday after pleading guilty to paying to rig her daughter's entrance exam.", "authors": ["Valerie Vande Panne", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429531136&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C211", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
