Now, of course in the mechanism as part of the intensive negotiations, we can look at that and discuss that.\u2019\n\nLabour MP Lisa Nandy said the current proposal \u2018stands virtually no chance of being accepted by the EU\u2019 and is incompatible with international law.\n\nShe told Sky: \u2018I would vote for a deal, but this is not a deal.\u2019\n\n\u2018This is a pre-election party-political broadcast from the Prime Minister, and the truth is that for all of the talk about getting Brexit done, we are further away from achieving a deal than we were two months ago when he became Prime Minister.\u2019\n\nWriting in The Sun on Sunday, Mr Johnson described his offer as a \u2018practical compromise that gives ground where necessary\u2019 and represents \u2018jumping to the island in the middle of the river\u2019.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
