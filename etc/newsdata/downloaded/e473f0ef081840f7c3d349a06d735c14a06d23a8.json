I support what is happening in the Judiciary committee because that enables them to do their process of interrogation and their investigation. And I salute them for that work,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on the subject and there\u2019s nothing different from one day to the next,\u201d she added.\n\nHowever, the top-ranking Democrat notably avoided using the I-word to describe the ongoing investigation like several Judiciary members, including Chairman Jerry Nadler, have.\n\nRather, she doubled down on the argument she\u2019s been using for months \u2014 impeachment is a possibility but six committees need to finish the investigations that have been ongoing for months first.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is a very divisive measure, but if we have to go there, we\u2019ll go there. But we can\u2019t go there unless we have the facts,\u201d she added.\n\nSince the Judiciary committee announced new rules \u2014 which passed in committee Thursday morning \u2014 to govern their investigation, Democrats have been offering a variety of descriptions on what work is being done.\n\nJudiciary members call it an impeachment investigation and argue it\u2019s been ongoing for a while. Others either don\u2019t consider it a formal impeachment investigation or believe the committee is just starting to craft one.\n\nEven senior members of leadership have offered mixed messages on the investigation.\n\nMajority Leader Steny Hoyer directly contradicted Chairman Jerry Nadler and other Judiciary Democrats on Wednesday when he told reporters he didn\u2019t consider the ongoing work to be an impeachment inquiry. Instead, he believed that would being after the full House authorizes it or\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Hakeem Jeffries embraced the phrase \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d on Thursday, though he avoided using the phrase at a press conference the day before.\n\nDespite the mixed signals, top Democrats are pushing to get passed what they describe as a simple issue of semantics and remained focuses on the substance of the investigation or their legislative agenda.\n\nMrs. Pelosi did the same, after growing frustrated with several questions on the impeachment investigation term, and urged reporters to consider the gun control debate.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we spend some time going over to Mitch McConnell and asking him why he doesn\u2019t want to save lives,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is it you\u2019re hung up on a word over here when lives are at stake over there?\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
