We're here to find the truth,' Pelosi said in response to the pressure from Republicans and the White House.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi has said no to a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry into Trump\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans have argued the impeachment inquiry isn't legitimate without a vote\n\nShe charged Republicans have turned to attacking the process as they have no substance to defend the president.\n\n'They have no substance. They can't defend the president so they're going to process,' she said after a press conference on Capitol Hill after a meeting with her Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThere are reports of disagreement among Pelosi and her leadership team - including the committee chairs leading the investigation into Trump - about whether or not to hold such a vote.\n\nPelosi can still call one at a future date.\n\nA vote would undermine a key Republican argument that questions the legitimacy of the inquiry but it would also put vulnerable Democratic members in swing House districts in a tough spot ahead of next year's election.\n\nPelosi and the Democratic leadership team have been taking the temperature of the caucus to see if there is an appetite for such a vote.\n\nGiven that one is not happening, it is likely they are getting push back from lawmakers worried about the 2020 election.\n\nDemocrats hold the majority in the House and such a vote would pass but it is the political implications the speaker is wary of.\n\nAnd even some Republican lawmakers would be uneasy about being put in the politically tough spot of having to go on the record.\n\nWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to Pelosi last week the process was 'illegitimate' and 'constitutionally invalid' without a full House vote.\n\n'In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step,' he argued.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi has said no to a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump - at least for now, sparing vulnerable lawmakers from having to take\u00a0 a a public position on a politically tough issue.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19764726-0-image-a-34_1571183589875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
