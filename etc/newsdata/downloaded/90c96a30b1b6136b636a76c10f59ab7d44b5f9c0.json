The 55-inch Vizio M-Series Quantum TV boasts an excellent image quality and smart features for a reasonable price.\n\nRight now, it's even cheaper than usual. You can get the 55-inch model of the TV for $300 off at Best Buy for a limited time. That brings the total price down to $499.99, which is great for a TV of this size and quality.\n\nThere are a ton of things to like about the Vizio M-Series Quantum TV, but perhaps the most important thing is the image quality. As you would expect, the TV offers a 4K resolution and support for HDR. It uses Vizio's Quantum Color tech, which makes for a bright, vivid image quality that looks natural.\n\nThe TV display has 600 nits of brightness and 90 local dimming zones, which help produce deep black levels and plenty of contrast. Safe to say, in this price range, this is one of the best-looking TVs.\n\nVizio's octa-core processor can also upscale non-4K and non-HDR content so the images look great even if the video's resolution isn't 4K.\n\nThe TV runs on Vizio's SmartCast 3.0 operating system, so you can install all your favorite streaming apps and services. It also comes with Vizio WatchFree, which lets you watch live TV from over 150 channels for free. The TV supports Apple AirPlay 2, so you can stream content from your phone or computer to your TV. If you use HomeKit smart home devices, you can connect them to the TV too.\n\nVizio's M-Series TV is available in different sizes too, if you want them. The 65-inch model is on sale for $250 off its normal price, while the 50-inch model is $150 off. We don't know how long the sale will run at Best Buy, so you may want to act quickly if you want one of these TVs.", "description": "Vizio makes some of the most popular TVs available, at relatively reasonable prices.
