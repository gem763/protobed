Didn\u2019t have them when he was in the majority, either. So the game that he\u2019s played, the politics that he\u2019s pursued, have given us absolutely nothing, and have produced a situation where we lose nearly 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year.\u201d\n\nSchumer has criticized O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hard-line support for mandatory assault weapon buybacks. Earlier this month, O\u2019Rourke vowed on the Democratic debate stage to remove military-style weapons from the public, declaring: \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47. You\u2019re not going to be allowed to use it against your fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer: \"I don\u2019t know of any other Democrat who agrees with @BetoORourke.\"#NEW O'Rourke fires back tonight: \"Ask @SenSchumer what he\u2019s been able to get done.

The poll found that about one-third of Republican respondents were in favor of the measure, as were most of the Democrats who took part in the survey.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he was awaiting \u201cguidance from the White House as to what [President Donald Trump] thinks he\u2019s comfortable signing,\u201d The Associated Press reported. Until then, Congress is in a \u201cholding pattern\u201d with regard to gun reform, McConnell said.\n\nSchumer \u2015 who pushed for the 1993 passage of the so-called Brady Bill to require a federal background check when buying a gun from a licensed dealer \u2015 has expressed frustration with McConnell\u2019s inaction, as Trump has already vowed to veto a House-passed bill to bolster background checks on firearm purchases and expand them to cover private sales.\n\nOn Sunday, both Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reportedly told Trump that any gun control proposal must include that bill, or they may wind up with no legislation at all.", "description": "Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has criticized O'Rourke's plan for mandatory assault weapon buybacks.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d84dafd2100005a00e4fd96.jpeg?cache=tcdervbveb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
