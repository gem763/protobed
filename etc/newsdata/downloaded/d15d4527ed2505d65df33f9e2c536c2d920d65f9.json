Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who was appointed by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in 2017, proclaimed the legislation dead days later. But she also declined to withdraw the legislation, spurring additional \u2014 larger \u2014 protests that at times disrupted financial and transportation systems, leading to clashes with police.\n\nMany in the West have wondered why China hasn\u2019t taken firmer action to quell the protests.\n\nAs an expert on social movements and political change, I believe that the conflict in Hong Kong \u2014 and its resolution \u2014 may have implications for America and the rest of the world. If China brings Hong Kong under its thumb, this shift would alter the terrority\u2019s politics and economic decision-making. Such a change would undoubtedly ripple through the global economy and affect the ability of American companies to do business abroad.\n\nYet, for now, China\u2019s response is fairly subdued. That may be because China is benefiting from not appearing to be involved. Here are three ways.\n\n1. Repression and control\n\nHong Kong\u2019s residents have more freedom than Chinese residents living in mainland China \u2014 including an independent legal system and a free press.\n\nThat\u2019s because Hong Kong is its own special administrative region, which gives it significant autonomy from China\u2019s central government. This model, known as \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d was a condition imposed by the British when they transferred Hong Kong back to China in 1997.\n\nBut China\u2019s leaders in Beijing want to bring the territory under its control. In 2014, for example, a Hong Kong court purged several pro-democracy politicians from the territory\u2019s Legislative council and installed pro-Beijing politicians in their place. Much like this summer, Hong Kong\u2019s citizens took to the streets, and their calls for democracy were met with pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nWhile China is well known for its overt and covert repression against its citizens, in the case of Hong Kong, Beijing can argue it is not directing Lam\u2019s response, but is simply standing by if she calls on Beijing for assistance.\n\nChina has little to lose by taking this approach. If conflict between the police and citizens resumes and the political system destabilizes, China can swoop in and try to remake Hong Kong in its own image.\n\nThis is certainly a possibility. State repression, even when it involves violence against demonstrators, does not always end protest movements. If residents of Hong Kong sense that their window of opportunity to effect change is closing, they may risk their lives to push back against the government. That kind of violence between police and demonstrators can escalate and create a political crisis.\n\nChaos in Hong Kong enables Beijing to continue to exert more control over the region \u2014 possibly crushing the pro-democracy movement once and for all \u2014 all while letting it deny its intent to do so.\n\n2. A show of military might\n\nEven if it remains on the sidelines, China\u2019s central government can use the protests to influence other outcomes in its favor.\n\nOver the past week, it has implied that it might intervene to end the demonstrations by moving military equipment and personnel to a sports center in Shenzhen, China, that is visible from Hong Kong.\n\nGetty Images Chinese military personnel maintain trucks and armored personnel vehicles are parked outside the Shenzhen Bay stadium earlier in August.\n\nThis show of force is a reminder to Hong Kong\u2019s citizens that Beijing is willing \u2014 and prepared \u2014 to assume control of the territory through the use of force. That may provide enough of an incentive for demonstrators to find a way to work with Lam and encourage a resolution more in Beijing\u2019s favor.\n\nArguably, this has already influenced some demonstrators\u2019 behaviors. While protesters are still calling for Lam\u2019s ouster and more democratic freedoms, one of the leaders of the pro-democracy Civil Human Rights Front told American news media that the group was working hard to ensure that the demonstrations would once again be peaceful. However, participants in mass demonstrations rarely share a single vision on how to effect political change. It is clear that some protesters continue to believe that violence will help them.\n\nAnother potential benefit to Beijing is the message their show of force sends to the Trump administration \u2014 proof that China can engage in video-ready shows of global military might. Such spectacles are one way that political leaders can buttress their authority and send a warning to other countries.\n\n3. Building support at home\n\nTrump\u2019s trade war is hurting China\u2019s economy. In fact, China\u2019s economic growth stalled to a 27-year low of 6.6%. Although this rate is still high compared to most world economies, slowdowns such as these increase citizen dissatisfaction, particularly in nondemocratic countries.\n\nWhile China has historically stymied popular protests, it has been harder to do so as more of its citizens gain access to the internet. Some Chinese citizens have moved away from politely protesting local officials to directly challenging government authority online, which is harder for government officials to contain.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong give China an opportunity to quell that discontent by redirecting their attention toward a common enemy \u2014 the demonstrators, who, according to government accounts broadcast on state television, are violent and often paid provocateurs doing America\u2019s bidding.\n\nBeijing\u2019s efforts to mobilize the citizenry around a Chinese identity seem to be working. On the social media site Weibo, users circulated a post that personifies China as a \u201clittle brother\u201d whom its citizens are rallying around and willing to defend against the demonstrators\u2019 disparaging characterizations. At least in the short term, this surge of nationalism will quell discontent at home.\n\nDeana Rohlinger is a sociology professor at Florida State University.
