Gavin Newsom, who has accused utilities of failing to adequately modernize and safely maintain their power systems, paid a visit to the Getty fire zone on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"This is a challenging time,\" Newsom told reporters at a command centre in the University of California's Los Angeles campus.\n\nFire officials are worried that strong winds will whip up embers like these in Calistoga, Calif. (Noah Berger/The Associated Press)\n\nAt the start of the day, firefighters in Los Angeles and those battling a much larger conflagration in Northern California's Sonoma County wine country took advantage of lighter winds to make headway before hazardous winds reemerged.\n\nFire officials worried that high winds forecast to gust to 113 km/h or more would lift embers from smoldering hot spots and carry them into unburned vegetation, re-igniting and spreading flames anew.\n\nA vineyard near Windsor California, scorched by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/kincadefires?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#kincadefires</a> sweeping through \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CountyofSonoma?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CountyofSonoma</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://t.co/Bc6URjQcbQ\">pic.twitter.com/Bc6URjQcbQ</a> \u2014@albertareporter\n\nCiting progress made against the Kincade Fire, Newsom said the number of evacuees in Northern California had diminished from 190,000 at the peak of that blaze to 130,000 on Tuesday.\n\nProperty losses from the Kincade, listed at 15 per cent contained, were put at 189 homes and other structures, double Monday's tally.\n\nGains in fight against Getty fire\n\nAn army of some 1,100 firefighters battled the Getty fire Tuesday in a narrow window of slower winds and consolidated those gains a day after flames and embers spread over scrub-covered slopes around expensive homes on the city's west side.\n\nBy early Wednesday, crews had managed to confine the blaze to about 263 hectares while carving solid containment lines around 15 per cent of its perimeter.\n\nCrews have made some progress in their fight to contain the Getty Fire, seen here on Monday.

(Gene Blevins/Reuters)\n\nIn Northern California, where firefighters struggled for a sixth day against a sprawling blaze in Sonoma County's wine-making region, high-wind forecasts prompted Pacific Gas and Electric Co to impose a new round of blackouts for nearly 600,000 homes and businesses.\n\nThat included about 400,000 customers blacked out in a power shut-off that PG&E instituted days earlier, the company said.\n\nEarly Wednesday, PG&E announced that it had restored about 73 per cent of the 970,000 or so customers affected in earlier shutoffs.\n\nUtilities serving Southern California's more highly urbanized areas have imposed smaller-scale outages.\n\nThe size of the Getty fire's evacuation zone was reduced by roughly 3,000 homes on Tuesday but residents of about 7,000 dwellings remained displaced, fire officials said. At least a dozen homes have been destroyed so far.", "description": "Fast-moving Santa Ana winds are expected to blast through Southern California on Wednesday, whipping up new wildfires after a brief respite for firefighters a day earlier.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340628.1572429220!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1178971419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
