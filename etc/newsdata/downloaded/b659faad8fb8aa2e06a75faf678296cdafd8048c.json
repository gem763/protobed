Under his newest plan, he is ensuring those in the highest income bracket pay what he sees as their fair share in taxes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sanders released his \u201cTax on Extreme Wealth\u201d proposal. The plan would place a 1% tax on the top 0.1% of American households. The tax \u201cwould start with a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million for a married couple,\u201d according to the release. \u201cThat means a married couple with $32.5 million would pay a wealth tax of just $5,000.\u201d\n\nThe tax rate would increase to 2% on households with new worth between $50 million and $250 million, 3% on net worth up to $500 million, 4% on new worth up to $1 billion, and so on up to a 8% tax on wealth over $10 billion.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, Sen.

Scott Applewhite) More\n\n\u201cAt a time when millions of people are working 2 or 3 jobs to feed their families, the three wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cEnough is enough. We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America, and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy.\u201d\n\nSanders claims that \u201cthe wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class.\u201d\n\nThe revenue generated from this tax on the wealthy would go towards other plans of Sanders, including Medicare for All, universal child care, and affordable housing.\n\nThere is growing support for taxing the wealthy. A poll from Politico/Morning Consult found that 76% of registered voters think wealthy Americans should pay more taxes. And, a Fox News survey found that 70% of Americans, including 54% of Americans, are in support of raising taxes on those who earn more than $10 million.\n\nBillionaires should not exist. https://t.co/hgR6CeFvLa \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, who have written extensively about the effects of wealth taxes, analyzed the Sanders proposal and estimates that this would raise $4.35 trillion over the next decade.\n\nZucman and Saez\u2019s $4.35 trillion estimate is higher than the two projected for Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan released earlier this year. Under her tax proposal, there would be a 2% wealth tax on individuals with a net worth over $50 million and 3% tax on those over $1 billion.\n\n\u201cA progressive wealth tax is the most direct policy tool to curb the growing concentration of wealth in the United States,\u201d the two said in a joint letter. \u201cIt can also restore tax progressivity at the very top of the wealth distribution and raise sorely needed tax revenue to fund the public good. Senator Sanders\u2019 very progressive wealth tax on the top 0.1% wealthiest Americans is a crucial step in this direction.\u201d\n\nAdriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.
