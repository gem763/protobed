That policy, which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended in a grand speech earlier this month, has stirred up a furor among critics who believe the company is not doing enough to monitor the disinformation spread through ads on its platform. Twitter\u2019s decision will affect ads on the platform globally and will not be limited to ads in the U.S.\n\nIn his announcement, Dorsey noted that online political ads \u201cpresent entirely new challenges to civic discourse\u201d and noted that the potency of online advertising \u201cbrings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions.\u201d\n\nDorsey believes that the new and sophisticated nature of ad targeting can give some forms of information an unearned advantage.\n\nIn his tweets, Dorsey took direct aim at Facebook\u2019s recent posture, stating that it is \u201cnot credible\u201d for a company like Twitter to say it\u2019s working to stem the flow of misinformation \u201cbuuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want! \ud83d\ude09\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s chief executive notes that the company thought about ending only its support for candidate ads, but saw issue ads as a loophole that could easily be used to avoid such restrictions.\n\nDorsey dismissed Zuckerberg\u2019s own defense of Facebook\u2019s lax political ad policies outright.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free expression,\u201d Dorsey said. \u201cThis is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\u201d\n\nTwitter\u2019s new policy was met with mixed reactions, split along political lines.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that Twitter recognizes that they should not permit disproven smears, like those from the Trump campaign, to appear in advertisements on their platform,\u201d Bill Russo, deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt would be unfortunate to suggest that the only option available to social media companies to do so is the full withdrawal of political advertising, but when faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy, it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton also praised the decision, calling it \u201cthe right thing to do for democracy in America and all over the world.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Russia\u2019s state-funded news outlet RT was less than pleased. \u201cTwitter bans political ads, caving in to \u2018election meddling\u2019 fearmongers,\u201d RT tweeted, with a link to the news.\n\nTrump 2020 Campaign Manager Brad Parscale similarly slammed the platform\u2019s decision. \u201cTwitter bans political ads in yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives,\u201d Parscale tweeted. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be surprised if @twitter lifted the ban after 2020.\u201d", "description": "The decision comes as criticism of Facebook's own political ad policies reaches a fever pitch.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572465803/1910330-hatmaker-twitter-political-ads-tease_wo48wk", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
