Both are elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerabilities. These types of vulnerabilities are usually exploited by malware to gain the ability to run malicious code with administrator privileges on (previously) infected hosts.\n\nThe first bug, CVE-2019-1214, is an EoP in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver. The second, CVE-2019-1215, impacts the ws2ifsl.sys (Winsock) service.\n\nAs usual, Microsoft didn't reveal any details of how the two bugs were being exploited in the wild, only acknowledging a security researcher from Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team with discovering the first.\n\nNew RDP vulnerabilities\n\nAll in all, this month's Patch Tuesday is as bulky as all the Patch Tuesday releases have been in recent months, which have regularly ballooned at over 70 fixed bugs on a regular basis.\n\nAlso just like in recent months, Microsoft patched remote code execution bugs in the Remote Desktop Protocol. This month, there have been only two -- CVE-2019-1290 and CVE-2019-1291.\n\nBoth bugs were discovered by Microsoft's internal team, and unlike the BlueKeep and DejaBlue vulnerabilities disclosed in May and August, Microsoft didn't say if these two could be abused to create self-spreading wormable malware/exploits.\n\nNon-Microsoft security updates\n\nSince the Microsoft Patch Tuesday is also the day when other vendors release security patches, system administrators may also want to install patches released today by Adobe and SAP.\n\nMore in-depth information on today's Patch Tuesday updates is available on Microsoft's official Security Update Guide portal.
