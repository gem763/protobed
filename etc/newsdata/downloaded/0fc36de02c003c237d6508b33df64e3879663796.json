At least one analyst appreciates the strategy.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the move given the: 1) prolonged U.S./China trade war and 2) it seems to position Fitbit to have greater control of its future pricing and, therefore, its margins,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said in a note.\n\n\u201cWe expect more of our covered companies to mirror Fitbit's efforts and, at the minimum, move some of their supply-chain efforts out of China and, at the maximum, move all of them.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Forte foresees such moves by Logitech International SA (NASDAQ: LOGI), Roku Inc (NASDAQ: ROKU), Sonos Inc (NASDAQ: SONO), Turtle Beach Corp (NASDAQ: HEAR) and Zagg Inc (NASDAQ: ZAGG).\n\nWhat\u2019s Next\n\nHow Fitbit and peers strategize around trade policy may trigger a federal reaction.\n\n\u201cTo the extent more companies exit China, we do expect government to respond, though it is not clear to us yet as to how,\u201d Forte said.\n\nFitbit will comment on the financial implications of its move in its third-quarter earnings call. The company\u2019s stock was trading down 0.68% at $3.66 at the time of publication.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nFitbit Launches New Smartwatch, Subscription Service\n\nAnalysts: If You Want To Get Fit, Don't Buy Fitbit Stock\n\nPhoto courtesy of Fitbit.\n\nLatest Ratings for FIT\n\nDate Firm Action From To Aug 2019 Maintains Neutral Jul 2019 Maintains Neutral Feb 2019 Upgrades Neutral Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for FIT\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
