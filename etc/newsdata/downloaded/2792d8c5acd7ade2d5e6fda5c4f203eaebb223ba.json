Andreescu is the first Canadian \u2014 man or woman \u2014 to win a major single's championship.\n\nWilliams didn't go down without a fight: after being down 5-1, in the second set, she rallied to win the next four games. But it wasn't enough to take down Andreescu, who won the next two games and win the set 7-5.\n\nIn the final of the Canadian Open last month, Andreescu won after Williams retired with an injury in the first set. The match is best remembered for Andreescu \u2014 who hadn't yet been born the first time Williams won the U.S. Open in 1999 \u2014 consoling the top player of this generation and letting Williams know just how much of an influence she has been, CBS Sports reports.\n\nBianca Andreescu of Canada celebrates winning match point during her Women's Singles final match against against Serena Williams of the United States on day thirteen of the 2019 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 07, 2019 in the Queens borough of New York City.

This one had none of the controversy of 2018, when she got into an extended argument with the chair umpire while being beaten by Naomi Osaka.\n\nWilliams has now been the runner-up at four of the seven majors she has entered since returning to the tour after having a baby two years ago. The 37-year-old American remains stuck on 23 Grand Slam singles title, one shy of Margaret Court's mark for the most in history.\n\nAndreescu went up 5-1 in the second set and served for the victory there, even holding a match point at 40-30. But Williams erased that with a forehand return winner off a 105 mph serve.\n\nThat launched a four-game run for Williams, who broke Andreescu again to make it 5-all. The Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd was overwhelmingly supporting Williams, not surprisingly, and spectators got so loud as she tried to put together a successful comeback that Andreescu covered her ears with her hands after one point.\n\nSuddenly, this was a contest.\n\nOr so it seemed.\n\nBut as well as Andreescu handled everything - herself, her far-more-experienced and successful opponent, and even the moment - Williams was far from her best, especially while serving. She got broken for the sixth time in the final game.\n\nSerena Williams of the United States reacts during her Women's Singles final match against Bianca Andreescu of Canada on day thirteen of the 2019 US Open at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on September 07, 2019.

She only has participated in four majors in her brief career.\n\nJust think: A year ago, Andreescu was losing in the opening round of qualifying.\n\nOn Saturday, there she was, putting her hands on her head, dropping her racket and then pumping her fists when it ended. After a hug from a smiling Williams at the net, Andreescu kissed the blue court and rolled onto her back, soaking in the applause.", "description": "Andreescu hadn't yet been born the first time Williams won the U.S. Open in 1999", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/07/61525bfb-ab86-45bc-a50b-028339048527/thumbnail/1200x630/72b8ac9a960dce2b1aa40d01e8b182d2/gettyimages-1173007634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
