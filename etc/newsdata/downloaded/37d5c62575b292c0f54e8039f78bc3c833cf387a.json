And I\u2019d also be keen to be given an extended opportunity to interview with Pope Francis. So the cardinal of music and Pope Francis would be my two bucket list interviewees.\n\n\u201cWhile he\u2019s often in the press and he gives quotes Simon\u2019s never actually talked in detail about what motivates him. Whether this persona on set is him or is it just an act?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also interested in whether he feels that he\u2019s been a force for good with these programmes because although people have gone on to great careers, I imagine that a lot of people have found that it\u2019s the end of the road for them. I wonder what he feels about that. So yeah, he\u2019d be fascinating.\u201d\n\nTV Insiders say if Martin is a hit on the show ITV could be interested in a special with Martin and Cowell.\n\nTold about Martin\u2019s wish, Cowell said: \u201cI think if we get on well on the show, maybe, yeah. Every time I do these interviews they always try and make you cry now.\n\n\"That\u2019s the problem. I learned that with Piers Morgan.\u201d\n\nCowell appeared on the third series of Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories in March 2010.\n\nThe X Factor: Celebrity returns to ITV tomorrow night and this weekend Bashir will find out if he is through to the live shows.", "description": "The broadcaster, 56, is best known for his high-profile TV interviews with Diana, Princess of Wales and Michael Jackson so it's no wonder he wants to speak to Simon next", "authors": ["Lily Waddell"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20644148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS195657923.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
