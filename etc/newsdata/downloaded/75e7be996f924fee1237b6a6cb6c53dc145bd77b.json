Sondland said \u201cthat Trump had told him that he wants President Zelenskyy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nRead: Maybe Rudy Giuliani Should Hire a Lawyer\n\nThose statements, if true, give crucial context as to why Trump was withholding badly needed military aid from Ukraine before his July 25 call with Zelensky: that he wanted investigations into both Vice President Joe Biden (his son Hunter served on Burisma\u2019s board) and into an unfounded conspiracy theory that would somehow disprove the fact that Russia hacked Democrats in 2016.\n\nThat\u2019s a helluva quid pro quo \u2014 and Trump\u2019s attempts to put Zelensky \u201cin a public box\u201d by getting him to make a statement on-camera ordering the investigations showed he was looking for video fodder to buttress his own political agenda.\n\nTaylor\u2019s narrative is only bolstered by his reputation as a widely-respected career diplomat, who was tapped for the Ukraine post by Trump himself after serving for decades in both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\n\u201cSecurity assistance money would not come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nTaylor said that on Sept. 1 another U.S. official, National Security Council member Tim Morrison, relayed that Sondland told a top Ukrainian official that \u201csecurity assistance money would not come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation,\u201d which Taylor said \u201calarmed him\u201d and was the first time he\u2019d heard that security assistance for Ukraine and not just a White House meeting \u201cwas conditioned on the investigations\u201d that Trump was demanding of his political rivals.\n\nThat information may be secondhand, but is particularly problematic \u2014 Taylor is saying that Trump was directly conditioning taxpayer-funded military aid to a critical U.S. ally in the middle of a defensive war against Russia on investigating Burisma, the company where former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter worked. That might be corroborated sooner rather than later by others. Expect lawmakers to push Morrison on what exactly he heard Sondland say during his planned testimony to the committees next week.\n\nTaylor said Trump wanted Ukrainian President Zelensky to \u201cgo to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference.\u201d\n\nTaylor said Morrison relayed a conversation Sondland had with Trump where the president denied a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 but \u201cdid insist that President Zelenskyy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference, and that President Zelenskyy should want to do this himself.\u201d Taylor quotes Sondland saying directly that Trump said Zelensky should \u201cclear things up and do it in public.\u201d\n\nAccording to Taylor\u2019s description, Sondland said Trump denied a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in one breath and admitted in the next.\n\nThis sounds a lot like what Trump said himself to Zelensky on that now-infamous July 25 call \u2014 \u201cdo us a favor, though\u201d and investigate the debunked theory that Ukraine has a server with the hacked emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u2018I will leave no stone unturned'\n\nTaylor said Sondland recommended specific language for Zelensky to use when speaking to Trump about the investigations.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland told me that he had recommended to President Zelensky that he use the phrase, \u2018I will leave no stone unturned\u2019 with regard to \u2018investigations\u2019 when President Zelensky spoke with President Trump,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe language paints Sondland as a more-willing accomplice in the scheme to elicit investigations from Ukraine than Sondland\u2019s own testimony from last week appeared to indicate.\n\nTaylor said he then followed up with a phone call to one of Zelensky\u2019s aides, who said Zelensky didn\u2019t want to be used as a \u201cpawn\u201d in a U.S. re-election campaign. Taylor said he conveyed that concern to Volker and Sondland.\n\n\u201c\u2018investigations\u2019 was a term\u201d\n\nTaylor said that he wasn\u2019t given a read-out of the call in which Trump asked Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d Biden and didn\u2019t see them until they were released publicly \u2014 but by then, he already had a pretty clear idea of what Trump wanted.\n\n\u201cI had come to understand well before then that \u2018investigations\u2019 was a term that Ambassadors Volker and Sondland used to mean matters related to the 2016 election, and to investigations of Burisma and the Bidens,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe fact that Taylor had such a strong and substantiated view that those two expressly political reasons were why Trump held up foreign aid lines up with what Trump himself seemed to be getting at in the call with Zelensky. Republicans have argued that Trump was just trying to root out corruption in the country. But it\u2019s hard to square that claim with Taylor\u2019s independent testimony, based on conversations he had outside of that call.\n\nCover: Bill Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, arrives to the Capitol for a deposition related to the House's impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, October 22, 2019.
