Gaudreau had an empty-net goal and posted his second multi-point game of the season.\n\nJacob Markstrom stopped 27 of 29 shots in the loss for Vancouver, which has lost its first two games.\n\nCalgary improved to 8-8-3 in home-openers since the turn of the century.\n\nThe Flames outshot the Canucks 14-5 in the second period and led 2-0 heading into the third.\n\nVancouver failed to convert a pair of third-period power plays. The first included 61 seconds of 5-on-3, but Rittich stopped three shots in that span and made 18 saves in the period.\n\nMonahan collected his second goal in as many games, scoring from the slot at 1:10 of the second on a feed from Gaudreau behind the goal-line.\n\nLindholm opened the scoring at 13:50 of the first.\n\nMyers misplayed a cross-ice pass in Calgary's zone onto the stick of Lindholm, who whipped the puck under Markstrom's arm.\n\nBoth teams opened their seasons with road losses Thursday.\n\nNOTES: Canucks veteran forward Loui Eriksson was a healthy scratch to make way for 23-year-old Adam Gaudette. ... The Flames, celebrating their 40th season in Calgary, wore retro jerseys. ... The Canucks have several events planned to commemorate their 50th season, including February's retirement of the numbers worn by siblings Daniel and Henrik Sedin.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlames: Host the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday.\n\nCanucks: Host the Los Angeles Kings on Wednesday in their home opener.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
