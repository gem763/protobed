Here\u2019s What He Said.", "language": "en", "text": "Syrian White Helmet civil defense workers search for victims from under the rubble of a destroyed building that hit by a Syrian government airstrike, in the northern town of Ariha, in Idlib province, Syria, on July 12, 2019.\n\n\u201cThis is going to jeopardize all the achievements we have made with the coalition against ISIS,\u201d said the top SDF commander Mazlum Abdi. It\u2019s up to Americans, now.\n\nOf all the post-9/11 conflicts, the one story of uninterrupted fragile, real, and endangered progress the United States has achieved is in northern Syria. Now comes the U.S. decision that could allow Turkey to launch an offensive in northeastern Syria. This would leave those who fought in partnership with America and against ISIS for the past five years sitting in the crosshairs, as Syrians await the promised Turkish military campaign aimed directly at them.\n\nOn Monday, I spoke by phone to Mazlum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, whose cemeteries sit full of white marble tombstones honoring young people who perished in the ISIS fight.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we were surprised by this decision because the security mechanism was ongoing and it was working and we did our best,\u201d said Abdi, referring to an August 2019 security agreement the U.S. established with Turkey to assuage its concerns about SDF\u2019s proximity to its border. \u201cWe did everything on our end to help this succeed.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision reflects a larger frustration with America\u2019s wars abroad. \u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA,\u201d he said, in a Monday tweet defending his decision to pull from northern Syria.\n\nThis is the second administration which believes deeply it was elected to end wars in the Middle East, not launch them. But it is the first to have seen the fruits of a policy of \u201cby, with and through\u201d that has largely succeeded. Syrians I\u2019ve met on the ground say they are thankful the Americans have remained in the region.\n\nAmerica\u2019s presence in northern Syria is not about loyalty or an expansive military footprint on the ground; it is about national security and whether the United States will keep pressure on ISIS and \u2014 something that deserves more attention, as the administration has noted \u2014 force U.S. allies to step up and take responsibility for their own citizens who fought for the Islamic State.\n\nWe have arrived at a moment where U.S. power could make a difference in creating a deal that would keep the ISIS fight in focus while stabilizing the region and succeeding at convincing allies to share more of the burden. Or the U.S. can decide to leave their battlefield partner to face on its own a NATO ally.\n\nThose who lead the U.S.-backed forces see the consequences standing right before them.\n\n\u201cIf this decision is implemented, of course a fight is going to erupt between us and the Turks in the northern border,\u201d said Abdi, noting that he hopes it does not come to this. \u201cIf our partners and our allies don\u2019t put big pressure on Turkey, it is only a matter of days.\u201d\n\nAbdi urged U.S. leaders to consider just how much this decision will place at risk all of the gains of the counter-ISIS fight.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to a security vacuum that ISIS will take advantage of and which will be in the ISIS interest,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to jeopardize all the achievements we have made with the coalition against ISIS.\u201d\n\nThis is not a moment for platitudes. Here\u2019s what gains the U.S. has made in northern Syria:\n\nFirst, achieving the territorial defeat of ISIS with fewer than five U.S. combat deaths. The U.S.-backed forces bore the casualties of the grueling block-by-block ISIS fight. More than 10,000 SDF members died in that fight.\n\nSecond, the U.S. has established an Oz-like presence in northern Syria in which you never \u2014 ever \u2014 see American forces on the ground, but in which U.S. interests are protected. This is one \u201cby, with and through\u201d operation that has worked. Local forces who did the ground fighting are able to keep Iran, Russia, the Syrian regime, ISIS and, until now, NATO ally Turkey\u2019s security concerns at bay while allowing moms and dads to send their kids to school in fragile but real stability. In a neighborhood of the region that is ground zero for extremism and the fight against the Islamic State, local women and men are leading their own fight for their children\u2019s future. The United States is the invisible presence which has, even with fewer than 2.000 forces, enabled stability on the ground by keeping other actors at bay and letting local forces do their jobs protecting people.\n\nThird, the United States has a partner on the ground that it trusts deeply and who has done what Washington asked. This is a non-state actor that now imprisons ISIS fighters whom it has battled since 2014, and which has taken responsibility for more than 70,000 ISIS families \u2014 folks no one else in the world has wanted and whose home countries, in the case of most foreigners, don\u2019t want them back.\n\nFinally, women have played a central role in the fight against ISIS and have reshaped their societies in the process \u2014 across the region and across ethnic groups. While in Washington, I always am asked if the \u201cwomen\u2019s thing\u201d is a Washington creation. On the ground in Syria, you can see that progress is not about \u201cforeign influence\u201d; instead, it\u2019s about seeing combat-veteran women who led the fight against ISIS translate those gains into expanding roles for women across politics and civil society across the region and among all ethnic groups. The U.S. did not create or even play much of a role in this phenomenon, it simply benefits from it.\n\nIn the last two years, I frequently joked that there was more of a can-do spirit and a sense that positive change was possible in northeastern Syria than northwest Washington, D.C. America has a moment in which it can engage with its wars, acknowledge the gains and push for an outcome that would not leave the ISIS fight in tatters or a yawning security vacuum in the region.\n\nIt is not only up to the White House. It is up to Americans to care.", "description": "\u201cThis is going to jeopardize all the achievements we have made with the coalition against ISIS,\u201d said the top SDF commander Mazlum Abdi.
