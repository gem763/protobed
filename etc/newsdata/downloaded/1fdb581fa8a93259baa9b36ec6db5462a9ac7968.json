Add Interest\n\nJust about everything you need to know about the state of the case for and against impeachment played out in the space of a few minutes involving Mick Mulvaney.\n\nABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked the acting White House chief of staff -- directly -- if there was a \"quid pro quo\" where American funding to Ukraine \"will not flow unless the investigation into the Democrats' server happens as well.\"\n\n\"We do that all the time with foreign policy,\" Mulvaney said. \"I have news for everybody: Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy.\"\n\nWin Mcnamee/Getty Images\n\nMulvaney later issued a statement contending that his words were misconstrued. But that response shows both the potential strength and weaknesses of the case Democrats are building for impeachment.\n\nThe challenge for Democrats in the impeachment inquiry is focusing on what's known, as opposed to what's unknown. It's about what's being admitted, as opposed to what's being denied.\n\nAt the same time, it's about who is talking -- and more people are talking almost every day -- as well as who is not. And, with Energy Secretary Rick Perry set to depart the administration, it's about who is going as well as who is staying, plus one prominent figure -- Rudy Giuliani -- who was never working for the administration in the first place.\n\nThis week crystallized the mind-bending contradictions and eye-popping justifications that have become normal operating procedure in the Trump White House.\n\nThe facts are fairly well-established already in the impeachment inquiry. \"Get over it\" is not a legal strategy, but remember that impeachment is far more political than it is legal.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nThere was some serious irony to the fact that President Trump got his crowd in Dallas, Texas, to finish his sentence in unison: \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d\n\nJust hours after his own Chief of Staff seemed to admit to a quid pro quo scheme himself -- holding federal, congressionally-approved aid at ransom for political reasons -- the president was using those words to accuse Joe Biden\u2019s son of corrupt behavior but without any facts.\n\nSpecifically, Trump said the former vice president\u2019s son received a \u201cpayoff.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his own private business ventures while his father was serving as vice president, Hunter Biden told ABC News earlier this week, \u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it -- I know that there was -- did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in \u2014 in \u2014 in many ways? Yeah.\"\n\nThe back and forth of it all has likely successfully muddied the waters for the president\u2019s most ardent fans. The question resonating in the crowd in Dallas was how could the president have done anything wrong, if there was a corruption allegation to look into?\n\nNot once during President Trump\u2019s Thursday rally did he defend asking the Ukrainian government for a favor. Instead he implied there could be no wrongdoing because he released details of his call with the Ukrainian president. If in plain sight, there must mean nothing to hide.\n\nOver and over though, he demanded to know who the whistleblower was and blasted the inspector general who escalated the whistleblower\u2019s claim, though he appointed him.\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe TIP with Adam Kelsey\n\nWe're beginning to get a sense for how Sen. Bernie Sanders' return to the trail will look. After he initially acknowledged that his heart attack would force him to \"change the nature\" of his rigorous rally schedule, now he's saying he \"misspoke\" and plans to \"get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.\"\n\nFirst, there's the much-ballyhooed \"Bernie's Back\" rally in New York City on Saturday, where Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will lend not only her endorsement, but her energy to help shoulder the load for Sanders.\n\nSara D. Davis/Getty Images, FILE\n\nAnd then it's back to business as usual, as the senator sits for an interview on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!,\" travels to Iowa and South Carolina for two forums and takes a tour of Rep. Rashida Tlaib's Michigan congressional district -- all over the course of just five days.\n\nSanders earned solid reviews this week for returning to the debate stage with the same vitality we've come to expect over the past four years. But the weeks ahead may still be viewed as a test of whether he's up for the four arduous months remaining before the early states vote and caucus.\n\nThe combination of a reinvigorated return to the stump, a couple of endorsements from the \"Squad,\" and his field-leading $33.7 million on-hand could be the boost he needs to arrest his recent poll slide and give his campaign a second wind.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\n\"I instantly fell in love with her. And then I've fallen in love with her more every day,\" Hunter Biden says of marrying his new bride, Melissa Cohen Biden, after only knowing her for six days. The former vice president's son talks about why his life is in \"the best place I've ever been\" in an exclusive interview with ABC News.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.
