But the separatist group\u2019s legacy continues to play a prominent role in Spain\u2019s polarized politics, with politicians on the right claiming its influence is still alive and well in the north of the country.\n\nOver the last three years, the small town of Alsasua has been the backdrop to a deeply controversial judicial case that epitomizes the fraught relationship between Spain\u2019s conservative unionists and its nationalist periphery.\n\nNestled in the mountains an hour\u2019s drive from the French border, Alsasua is in the region of Navarre, which borders the Basque region and is claimed as part of the Basque homeland by nationalists.\n\n\u201cWe are being used as puppets in a game,\u201d said Edurne Goikoetxea, a local woman. \u201cA narrative is being peddled about Alsasua and the whole of Navarre and the Basque Country as a place of conflict.\u201d\n\nGoikoetxea is the mother of Ainara Urquijo, one of eight young people from the town who were given jail sentences last year for their role in a late-night incident in a bar in October 2016 in which two plain-clothes civil guards were injured. One of them broke his ankle and two women who were accompanying the civil guards were also hurt.\n\nETA declared a definitive ceasefire in 2011, ending a four-decade campaign of violence in which it killed more than 800 people.\n\nThose jailed insist that what happened that night was simply a drunken scuffle. But prosecutors disagreed, claiming that the clash had been part of a concerted strategy of hostility by a faction of local people who aimed to drive security forces from the town.\n\nProsecutor Jos\u00e9 Perals described their actions as part of \u201ca legacy of terror in the Basque Country and Navarre which is a continuation of the terrorism that Spain has lived through for 50 years.\u201d\n\nHe brought terrorism charges against the defendants, calling for jail sentences of up to 62 years. The Madrid court that tried them eventually dropped the terror-related charges. However, ruling that the assault had been driven by \u201cradicalization, animosity and intolerance\u201d toward the security forces, it gave seven of them jail sentences ranging from nine to 13 years for assault and public disorder. Urquijo received a two-year jail sentence for threatening behavior and has been released.\n\n\u201cThis whole situation has been a farce from the beginning,\u201d said Haizea Ramirez de Alda, whose brother Adur received a 12-year sentence. She, like Goikoetxea, believes the civil guard, judiciary and politicians have colluded to manipulate this case in an effort to fabricate a common enemy in northern Spain.\n\nParties on the political right say that the Alsasua incident, like the homecoming ceremonies, shows how ETA\u2019s influence still lingers.\n\n\u201cSome of the powers don\u2019t want to accept that we are in a new period of peace in the Basque Country because they are not comfortable without ETA,\u201d she said.\n\nThe defendants in the case \u2014 seven of them have been in preventive custody for nearly three years \u2014 are now waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on their appeal against the sentences.\n\nLingering influence\n\nETA declared a definitive ceasefire in 2011, ending a four-decade campaign of violence in which it killed more than 800 people. In May of 2018, it formally disbanded.\n\nBut many Spaniards believe it has left open wounds. Terrorism victims\u2019 groups say over 300 ETA killings have not been resolved. They also denounce so-called ongi etorri \u2014 jubilant ceremonies for ETA members on their release from prison. In one recent example, Basque flags were brandished and fireworks let off in tribute to Jos\u00e9 Javier Zabaleta, a former ETA commander who had spent 29 years in jail, when he returned to his hometown of Hernani.\n\nParties on the political right say that the Alsasua incident, like the homecoming ceremonies, shows how ETA\u2019s influence still lingers.\n\n\u201cThere is a part of Alsasua society that is sick and which spreads hatred against everything that Spain represents,\u201d said Javier Esparza, president of the Navarrese People\u2019s Union (UPN), a right-of-center regional party.\n\nSpeaking at the UPN headquarters in Navarre\u2019s capital Pamplona, Esparza said his party is unable to put up local candidates in towns like Alsasua, despite having voters there, because they fear harassment from Basque nationalists.\n\nHe describes EH Bildu, the pro-independence political party that is seen to represent many of the voters who once supported ETA and has seats in Alsasua and many other town halls, as a front for the terrorist group.\n\n\u201cBefore, they used to murder civil guards, now they beat them up,\u201d he said.\n\nGorka Landaburu, editor of the current affairs publication Cambio 16, believes such appraisals of the Alsasua episode are exaggerated.\n\nLocals frequently complain of harassment by the civil guard \u2014 who are posted to Navarre from other parts of Spain.\n\n\u201cIt was a serious incident, but this was a disproportionate sentence for what was a bar brawl,\u201d he said.\n\nLandaburu, who survived an attempt on his life by ETA in 2001, also sees the furor surrounding Alsasua bleeding into national politics.\n\n\u201cThe hardcore right is using Alsasua for electoral reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, the leader of the stridently unionist Ciudadanos party, Albert Rivera, staged an event in the town as a show of support for the two civil guards involved in the bar incident. With representatives of the conservative Popular Party (PP) and the far-right Vox also attending, the visit was seen as highly provocative.\n\nThen, in March of this year, PP leader Pablo Casado riled many Alsasua locals when he gave an interview to right-wing journalist Eduardo Inda in the Koxka bar where the civil guards were injured.\n\n'Occupation force'\n\nAccording to Spain\u2019s right, such gestures demonstrate unionist resolve and contrast with the left\u2019s tolerance of radical Basque nationalism. For proof, they point to the Socialist Mar\u00eda Chivite, who became president of the Navarre region in August, her successful investiture being made possible by the abstention of EH Bildu. Although the Socialist Party denies having made any concessions to EH Bildu, the opposition is not convinced.\n\nCiudadanos has described the supposed agreement behind the abstention as \u201cthe mother of all infamies.\u201d Esparza, meanwhile, claimed that Chivite had made a deal with \u201cETA\u2019s front men.\u201d\n\nSocialist acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has faced similar charges. A parliamentary no-confidence motion that made him prime minister in 2018 flourished partly because EH Bildu backed it, a fact Rivera, Casado and others have not let him forget. As he seeks to form a new government in the coming weeks, the Basque nationalists\u2019 cooperation might once again play a role.\n\nYet Socialists did briefly find common ground with the right recently in the Navarre parliament when they voted together to condemn an annual event in Alsasua known in the Basque language as Ospa Eguna (\u201cFarewell day\u201d), which calls for the expulsion of Spanish security forces from the town. It is a mainly festive occasion, with a cross-country run, a town square banquet and street demonstrations, albeit with a very serious message: that the civil guard, which has barracks nearby, is not welcome.\n\nLocals frequently complain of harassment by the civil guard \u2014 who are posted to Navarre from other parts of Spain \u2014 and the regional police. Many describe their presence as an \u201coccupation.\u201d\n\nOspa Eguna \u201cis the day when we make clear we don\u2019t want [Spanish] security forces in our country,\u201d said Aitor, a young man who preferred not to give his surname. \u201cWe suffer police repression on a day-to-day basis \u2014 they stop us, they ask for documents, they threaten us, because they see that we don\u2019t want to be part of their state.\u201d\n\nBut while this poor relationship with the police was for a long time the major factor behind widespread mistrust of the Spanish state in nationalist towns like Alsasua, the ongoing court case now seems to have convinced many people that the judiciary and political class are also against them.\n\nLandaburu says such issues make it difficult to give peace a chance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great shame for the majority of people in Alsasua and in Navarre and the Basque Country,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want peaceful coexistence.\u201d", "description": "Although separatist group ended its terrorist campaign eight years ago,  its legacy plays a prominent role in Spain\u2019s politics.", "authors": ["Guy Hedgecoe", "Carmen Paun", "Isabella Borshoff", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h_55078440-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
