Francis Rooney.\n\n1. He\u2019s a Republican in his second term in the House.\n\n2. He\u2019s loaded.\n\n3. He\u2019s the guy who once accused \u201cdeep state\u201d agencies like the FBI of being off the rails and called on the heads of those agencies to \u201cpurge\u201d them of their nefarious members.\n\nNot a man, in other words, whom you\u2019d expect to find two years later allied with Nancy Pelosi in wondering whether the president isn\u2019t a little too friendly with Vladimir Putin.\n\nYet here we are.\n\n\u201cDo you agree at all with the assessment then from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the private meeting with the president earlier this week where she reportedly said to him, \u2018Sir, all roads lead to Putin, lead to Russia.\u2019 Do you share that concern?\u201d Harlow wondered. \u201cWell I\u2019ve read some of that,\u201d the GOP lawmaker answered. \u201cI was skeptical of it, like most Republicans. But I have to say this business about the Ukraine server, which no one heard about until it was mentioned recently, tells me what\u2014are we trying to exculpate Russia, who all our trained intelligence officials have consistently corroborated that Russia was behind the election meddling, not the Ukraine[?]\u201d\n\nHuh. He wasn\u2019t done either. Mick Mulvaney\u2019s admission of some sort of quid pro quo with Ukraine yesterday has Rooney taking a fresh look at impeachment:\n\nSome striking comments from GOP Rep. @FrancisRooney, who just gaggled w/ reporters. Says he was \u201cshocked\u201d by Mulvaney\u2019s admission of a quid pro quo & says it could be a turning point in the Ukraine saga. Also says it can\u2019t be walked back, saying it\u2019s \u201cnot an-etch a-sketch.\u201d \u2014 Melanie Zanona (@MZanona) October 18, 2019\n\nRooney \u2014 who says he hasnt decided whether he is running for re-election \u2014 also says he\u2019s not scared of the political repercussions for speaking out. But he acknowledges that other Republcians are scared of Trump. \u2014 Melanie Zanona (@MZanona) October 18, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about him to explain what\u2019s changed in his thinking, but maybe we shouldn\u2019t overthink it. It could be that Rooney has simply had his fill of the Trump circus, is grossed out by the Ukraine business, and is unconcerned about earning the president\u2019s wrath. A man in his 60s who\u2019s in his first term in Congress and has already made a fortune won\u2019t cry if he can\u2019t spend his dotage on the Hill. (He admits at the end of the clip below that he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019ll run again.) The most telling thing he says might be the fact that he and Mitt Romney are friends from way back; conceivably, Rooney has decided that if Romney\u2019s willing to criticize Trump in the Senate, he should provide some back-up in the House.\n\nWhatever the explanation, it\u2019s very unusual for a House Republican to lash Trump this way. The only House GOPer I can think of who\u2019s willing to do so since Justin Amash left the party is Adam Kinzinger, and Kinzinger tends to focus on military matters and foreign policy. Rooney hits Trump on that too \u2014 watch below from the beginning and you\u2019ll find him complaining about Trump\u2019s handling of Syria. But for a Republican in the House to admit that he\u2019s troubled by the Ukraine episode to the point where he hasn\u2019t ruled out impeachment is uncharted territory.\n\nHis comments about Ukraine and the missing server come exactly halfway through the clip. For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t think exculpating Russia is what\u2019s driving Trump\u2019s interest in CrowdStrike and the server, although it does have that effect. What he wants is to inculpate Democrats in the 2016 hackings. He\u2019s chasing the debunked conspiracy theory that the hacking of the DNC during the campaign was actually an inside job \u2014 possibly conducted by the much-maligned Seth Rich, possibly by someone else \u2014 but was cynically blamed on Russia in order to discredit Trump\u2019s glorious election victory. In other words, Trump wants to claim that not just the Russiagate investigation but Russian interference itself was some sort of Democratic hoax and he\u2019s been convinced somehow that Ukraine might have the missing DNC server that will prove it. A guy who has Bill Barr and John Durham investigating the origins of the Russia probe through proper DOJ channels shouldn\u2019t need to go chasing nonsense, but Trump does a lot of things he shouldn\u2019t do and has always loved conspiracy theories \u2014 especially those that place him as the victim of the plot. Rooney appears to have reached his limit with it.", "description": "\"This business about the Ukraine server ... tells me, what, are we trying to exculpate Russia?\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
