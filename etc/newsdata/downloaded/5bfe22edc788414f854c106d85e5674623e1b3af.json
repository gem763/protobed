The city has an annual pride parade and lively gay scene.\n\nIt does not, however, recognise same-sex marriage and LGBT+ activists voice concerns about widespread discrimination.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s top court in June ruled in favour of a gay civil servant fighting for spousal and tax benefits for his husband.", "description": "A Hong Kong court upheld a ban on same-sex marriage and civil union partnerships on Friday after a lesbian identified as 'MK' launched the city's first judicial challenge on the issue, stating it violated her constitutional rights.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442211338&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0LZ", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
