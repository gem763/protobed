Germany beat Estonia 3-0 despite playing with 10 men from the 14th minute.\n\nRobert Lewandowski set up both goals for Poland as Chicago Fire midfielder Przemyslaw Frankowski and fellow substitute Arkadiusz Milik scored late in a hard-fought 2-0 win over North Macedonia.\n\nPoland is assured of finishing in the top two of Group G, where second-place Austria boosted its hopes of qualifying with a 1-0 win at Slovenia.\n\nRussia earlier routed Cyprus 5-0 to join group winner Belgium in securing a place at next year\u2019s tournament. Valencia forward Denis Cheryshev scored twice and set up two more goals for the Russians \u2013 who only needed a draw to be sure of qualification \u2013 to take their tally to 21 points after seven wins from eight games in Group I.\n\nWith two games remaining, Russia has 11 points more than third-place Cyprus and 12 more than fourth-place Scotland, which thrashed San Marino 6-0 at a poorly attended Hampden Park in Glasgow.\n\nBelgium already had secured its place at the finals, but Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team stayed perfect in qualifying with a 2-0 win over Kazakhstan in Astana.\n\nMichy Batshuayi scored in the first half and Thomas Meunier wrapped up the win in the second, giving Belgium its eighth win from eight games.\n\nThe Belgians have scored 30 goals and conceded just one.\n\nBALE THWARTS CROATIA\n\nNikola Vlasic scored early to put Croatia on course for a win that would have secured qualification from Group E.\n\nBale\u2019s equalizer in first-half injury time denied the visitors \u2013 including Real Madrid teammate Luka Modric \u2013 and kept Welsh hopes of qualifying alive.\n\nCroatia leads the group by two points from Hungary, which defeated Azerbaijan 1-0 in Budapest thanks to Mih\u00e1ly Korhut\u2019s early strike.\n\nThe top three in the group are Croatia (14 points), Hungary (12) and Slovakia (10). Wales is fourth on eight points with a game in hand over the top two.\n\nG\u00dcNDOGAN SHINES\n\nIlkay G\u00fcndogan scored twice and set up another for 10-man Germany to beat Estonia with three second-half goals in Tallinn.\n\n\u201cThe whole week hasn\u2019t been easy,\u201d said Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w, whose side was hit by injuries. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t complain. The decisive thing was that we upped the pace in the second half. In the end it was satisfactory.\u201d\n\nEmre Can, filling in at center back, was shown an early red card for bringing down Frank Liivak, who would have been through on goal.\n\nGermany had never had a player sent off so early in a game before, with Can beating the mark set by Robert Huth\u2019s 15th-minute ejection in a friendly game against Northern Ireland in 2005.\n\nG\u00fcndogan finally broke the deadlock in the 51st when his effort from outside the penalty box took a slight deflection off Marco Reus\u2019 heel. His second goal six minutes later also took a deflection, this time off a defender.\n\nG\u00fcndogan\u2019s long pass over the top allowed substitute Timo Werner to wrap up the win in the 71st.\n\nGermany and the Netherlands are level on 15 points and well-placed to qualify from Group C. Northern Ireland is third on 12 points.\n\nThe Dutch earlier claimed a 2-1 win over Belarus in Minsk, thanks to first-half goals from Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum.\n\nThe top two teams of each group advance. The other four qualifiers will come through four tiers of playoffs in March.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "Poland and Russia qualified for the 2020 European Championship on Sunday, while Gareth Bale's goal forced Croatia to wait after a 1-1 draw with Wales.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/13/90343c_cyprus-russia-euro-2020-soccer-01698-russia-denis-cheryshev-celebrates-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
