Posted by Johnstown Police Department on Thursday, October 10, 2019\n\n\u201cPolice warn parents after finding Halloween candy laced with THC that looks harmless,\u201d read one local headline, even though there was no evidence that the found edibles were intended for Halloween trick-or-treaters. Other stories were similar. The warnings have been shared on Facebook thousands of times despite the best efforts of angry commenters and edible-pot enthusiasts pointing out that THC candies are way too expensive for someone to decide to give them out on Halloween.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis year\u2019s viral candy scare follows decades of variations on a theme: a dire warning about the secret sadist down the street who wants to put [insert horrible thing here] in your child\u2019s candy, followed by media coverage, followed by parents being actually terrified on a fake-spooky holiday. Who could blame them? Tampered-with candy is scary because it\u2019s possible. But there is little evidence to suggest that the stranger down the street is a real Halloween threat.\n\nThis year the fear-mongering is a bit more ahead of schedule, says Joel Best, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware. Best is also the world\u2019s leading (and, well, only) expert on Halloween candy contamination, and the contemporary legends that keep parents scared about what their kids are bringing home one night a year.\n\nBest was \u201cmoving up towards 10\u2033 interviews so far on rigged-candy horror stories by the time The Washington Post got to him. The calls started coming earlier than usual this year, he says, possibly because the circumstances are ideal for a viral Halloween scare.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a bad thing that happens in September that captures people attention,\u201d Best says, it can fuel a particularly lively panic After Sept. 11, 2001, for example, there were rumors of secret terrorists giving out cupcakes with propaganda written on them.\n\nBest has been researching and documenting contemporary legends about \u201cHalloween sadism\u201d since 1985. He updates his report on the topic every year. This year\u2019s scary health headlines about vaping THC, he guesses, may have created fertile conditions for worries about drug-laced Halloween candies to take root. Although that rumor has been circulating to some degree ever since some states started legalizing pot, it\u2019s getting more attention this Halloween now that THC is in the news because of a spate of vaping illnesses and deaths.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before. In 1982, a string of Chicago deaths linked to cyanide-tainted Tylenol tablets in the weeks before Halloween created a nationwide panic about candy. If some psychopath was out there poisoning painkillers, the thinking went, then certainly the country\u2019s supply of fun-size candy could also be a target. About 40 cities canceled Halloween altogether that year, according to newspaper articles from that time. Hospitals offered to x-ray collected candy for metal objects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne expectant father lamented to the Miami Herald that his future child might never experience Halloween:\n\nMike Lougee\u2019s first baby is due today, a scant two days from Halloween, but his son or daughter may never have the childhood thrill of seeing masses of candy cascade from an upended trick-or-treat bag.\n\nLougee fears that the Tylenol killings, and the copycat crimes they have inspired, may have changed forever the face of Halloween. He and parents throughout the nation fear their children may be poisoned by candy tainted by real-life gremlins and goblins.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a really sad state of affairs in this country,\u201d said Lougee, director of South Florida operations for Pizza Hut. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to take my child out trick-or-treating.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe way that you knew that 1982 was a big deal,\u201d Best says, \u201cwas that the confectionery industry hired experts to do a report on contaminated candy.\u201d Although reports of injuries and contamination spiked that year in the days around Halloween, Best\u2019s research matched what that study found: Many of the terrifying reports of razors in candies were hoaxes. And in each case where a death has been initially attributed to contaminated Halloween candy, authorities have ultimately come to different conclusions.\n\nAD\n\nThe most famous of these is probably the 1974 \u201ctrick-or-treat\u201d murderer, who killed 8-year-old Timothy O\u2019Bryan with cyanide-laced Halloween candy. But that story ended with a twist: Timothy\u2019s father was ultimately convicted and executed for his son\u2019s death.\n\nThe version of the story where a stranger uses Halloween candy as a lethal weapon is easy to imagine, but has been hard to verify in the real world. \u201cMy sense is that you cannot prove this never happened,\u201d Best says, but in decades of reviewing news reports of deadly Halloween candy from a menacing stranger, he has yet to find one that turned out to be true.\n\nAD\n\nBest has some theories on why the legend of the poisoned candy goes viral every year, despite the fact that there is now plenty of information out there debunking the rumors. First, he says, contemporary legends about contaminated food are baked into our culture.\n\nAD\n\nBut second, in a world where everything is scary and out of our control, the imagined sadist next door is a monster we can manage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best thing to be afraid of,\u201d Best says. \u201cHe only does it once a year.\u201d\n\nMore reading:\n\nAD", "description": "The October tradition of needlessly freaking out about strange sweets", "authors": ["Reporter Covering Digital Culture"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e64r5x4GbY5j5Lw_MId-RP6jKD0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JVILWLHVCII6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
