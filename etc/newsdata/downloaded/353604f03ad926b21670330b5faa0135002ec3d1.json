Well, tall for an action figure. (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nHasbro has been making awesome Star Wars action figures for decades at this point. But it\u2019s kicking off a new range of figures in the galaxy far, far away called \u201cHyperreal\u201d that are something totally new for the toymaker. It\u2019s definitely filled with new surprises...both great and not so great.\n\nIf the last time you truly dove deep in a Star Wars action figure owning habit was either when you had to mail away a box to get your own little telescoping-lightsaber Obi-Wan, or maybe even when Luke Skywalker looked a little more like He-Man than he did Mark Hamill, you might be surprised at just what Star Wars figures are capable of these days. Now, whether you\u2019re buying things in that classic 3.75\" scale or even the 6\" size that\u2019s come to dominate action figures at large, Star Wars figures are more articulated, more detailed, and generally better than ever. So what can make a new figure like this Hyperreal Darth Vader (full disclosure: a sample of the figure was provided by Hasbro for review) stand out, let alone worth of a nonsense buzzword name like \u201cHyperreal\u201d?\n\nA comparison between the 15cm-scaled Black Series Hoth Leia, the 20cm-scaled Hyperreal Darth Vader, and the 30cm scaled Hot Toys Hoth Leia. Sorry, I don\u2019t have a Hot Toys Vader at all\u2014I\u2019m not made of money\u2014and I couldn\u2019t find my Black Series Vader, so you get his daughter instead. Close enough? (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nFor starters, this Vader clocks in at around 20cm tall, an entirely new scale for Hasbro that\u2019s significantly larger than most of their current offerings (only the value-priced \u201cHero Series\u201d figures, which come in at 12\", are larger). It needs to be that big so Hasbro can do two more things in the hope of earning that new moniker: one is an unprecendented level of detail and material manufacturing, using not just plastic but fabric and, in Vader\u2019s case, rubberised latex to capture the details of his suit as closely to the movies as possible\u2014if you\u2019re the sort of Star Wars fan that takes notes of these kinds of details, this is specifically meant to be based on Vader\u2019s suit as seen in Empire Strikes Back.\n\nThe other is that, unlike Hasbro\u2019s other Star Wars figures, the Hyperreal Darth Vader is built around an internal, metal skeleton. The armature is almost similar to something you\u2019d see inside a claymation puppet or a maquette, as articulated, if not moreso than the average Black Series figure, but completely hidden by the design and material work of the figure itself. In future Hyperreal toys, it\u2019ll be hidden by a complete skinsuit. As Vader is already clad entirely in armour and clothing, it\u2019s already easy to obscure, but the effect is immediate to the eyes: you don\u2019t see the joints and seamlines you would on a normal action figure that immediately demarcate it in your mind as a toy. It\u2019s just...Darth Vader. He\u2019s there, on your desk, as if he\u2019d stepped right out of the movies.\n\nGive the Dark Lord a Hand, folks. (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nAnd that\u2019s really the grand success of this action figure. Hasbro\u2019s work with the Black Series line\u2014while having come leaps and bounds in recent years with more accurate sculpts and facepaints\u2014has been laudable, it\u2019s praise that often silently includes the suffix \u201c...for a $US20 ($30) toy.\u201d The Hyperreal Vader is a step so far beyond that, thanks to the incredibly painstaking detail afforded not just by the mixed materials used all over the figure and the seamless nature of the interior armature, but the sheer quality of the sculpting and paintwork itself. There\u2019s enough trickery going on here that my desktop, phone-camera pictures of it don\u2019t really do the effect justice: It\u2019s Darth Vader, as he lives and laboredly breathes. It looks stunning. It might not quite be \u201chyper\u201d real, but it\u2019s real enough to work.\n\nBut while the armature is key to the Hyperreal Vader\u2019s success as a thing to look at, it\u2019s also the reason that makes the figure also so frustrating: it is a pain in the arse to actually move this toy about.\n\nThe detail on this Vader is remarkable. (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\n(Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\n(Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\n(Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\n(Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\n(Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nBeing made of metal, and Vader himself clad in chunky, stretchy materials, trying to move any point of articulation on Vader\u2019s body that isn\u2019t his neck is an exercise in an awkward application of force and fiddling that doing any kind of pose that isn\u2019t him standing there looking ominous (which, to be fair, you\u2019re gonna do that with a Darth Vader figure) is an exercise in...well, not being really worth it. The joints are painfully stiff, restricting their movement before you even account for the bulkiness of the materials Vader is made up of getting in the way, and compounding that restrictiveness even further. And because all the articulation is unseen, you can\u2019t quickly see the particular way a joint is bent or rotated for easy tweaking like you could with a normal action figure. With enough patience you can coax him into a range of poses, from kneeling to powerfully slicing away with his lightsaber, but the fuss it takes to get there makes the Hyperreal Vader a toy you ultimately don\u2019t really want to actually play with. Getting it in and out of a pose is exhaustively annoying\u2014it might as well be a statue after you\u2019ve tweaked it for the first time.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s so rigid and stiff that, while attempting to take off Vader\u2019s right hand to replace it with one of the myriad alternates the figure comes with\u2014to posse him holding his saber, using the force, or menacingly gripping and pointing\u2014I heard an almighty pop and snap after the hand refused to come loose of the metal ball joint that sits atop the wrist. A joint in the bicep had either snapped or come loose, I can\u2019t tell\u2014because everything\u2019s internal and I\u2019ve got no way of checking if the ridiculous amount of force I\u2019d had to apply to this very expensive action figure without slicing open Vader\u2019s body suit and doing a small scale version of surgery.\n\nWhat the joint should look like... (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\n...and then what it suddenly looked like after the... let\u2019s say violent dislocation. (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nLuckily, the fact that the articulation is interior to Vader\u2019s suit means I can still cheat a bit\u2014his elbow still bends, his arm is just a bit looser, kind of like he actually broke it and needs to delicately support it (that is, if this \u201cmore machine than man\u201d villain actually didn\u2019t already have robot arms!). I can still pose it, it\u2019s suddenly a lot more delicate than it was. But the fact that that the Hyperreal Vader is so unwieldy to pose and actually play with in the first place\u2014which is, by its very name, kind of what you want to do with an action figure\u2014to the point that even trying to use it right requires a level of force and finicky meddling that can lead to an accident like that is lamentable. On a figure that costs $80? It\u2019s infuriating.\n\nIn the end, even without the articulation issues I faced\u2014which might just be down to user error as much as they could be the figure itself\u2014I ultimately came away from the Hyperreal Vader unsure of who the audience for this figure is. It\u2019s not for kids, because no one\u2019s buying a 10 year old $US80 ($118) action figures (plus, there\u2019s that excellent looking line of figures inspired by Galaxy of Adventures coming out, and $US80 ($118) could get you basically most of the initial wave of products there) that are, ultimately very awkward to play with.\n\nVader mainly comes with a giant array of swappable hands. Other than that, he has a stand, his lightsaber (with detachable blade), and a Force FX piece to replicate him blocking blaster bolts like he does on Bespin in Empire Strikes Back.

At 8\", it\u2019s incompatible with either the vast 3.75\" or 6\" scale collections Star Wars toy fans have been building up for years at this point, so you\u2019re essentially asking them to re-invest into a new scale of characters they likely already own several times over. And if they do? It\u2019s at a price point that is an awkward mix of both being radically more expensive than any other Star Wars figure Hasbro offers while also being much closer to the price territory of more premium Star Wars figures. Eighty bucks is pushing even beyond Japanese import territory like Bandai\u2019s S.H. Figurarts toys, which aren\u2019t just closer scaled to the 6\" Black Series, but make up for that significant extra cost with oodles of accessories, great paint quality, and tons of hyper-specfic articulation that makes them worth their high price.\n\nAnd hell, if you\u2019re gonna start dropping $US80 ($118) on an action figure on the regular? That\u2019s only three or so figures before you\u2019re looking at the price value of your average Hot Toys figure\u2014which feel both remarkably higher quality in terms of detail and much easier to actually pose and play with than the Hyperreal Vader does.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days, however. Vader is just the start\u2014the real test of this new line will come next year, when he\u2019s joined by an Empire Strikes Back Bespin Luke, Habsro\u2019s first test of its pretty remarkable \u201cphotoreal\u201d face-painting tech that has elevated the Black Series line from a level that was decent for 20 bucks to something almost magical for its scale. Maybe in the process some of the awkward quibbles that come with the nature of the kinds of materials Vader\u2019s outfit is made from will be less of a problem there. Maybe the interior armature will have been improved.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. But for now, we have this Vader: a testament that Hasbro can do something new and beautiful, but ultimately misses its mark.\n\nAt least he looks nice?
