The technology could allow smart phones to perform chemical analysis.\n\nToday\u2019s infrared spectrometers weigh several pounds. They are often bulky and difficult to integrate with mobile devices.\n\nThe compact infrared spectrometer developed by researchers at ETH Zurich \u2014 described this week in the journal Nature Photonics \u2014 promises to change that.\n\nThe new chip, measuring two centimeters by two centimeters, analyzes infrared light the same way a conventional spectrometer does. Spectrometers break infrared light into different wavelengths, creating a digitized frequency spectrum \u2014 a signature that can be interpreted by a computer. Because different chemicals produce different spectral signatures, a spectrometer reading can be used to identify the substance from which the light passed through or bounced off of.\n\nConventional spectrometers split light waves into two separate beams. The beams recombine after reflecting off of two mirrors. The recombined light is then measured by a photodetector.\n\nOne of the two mirrors can be moved to create an interference pattern, which allows the photodetector to measure the proportion of different wavelengths in light and produce a digitized frequency spectrum.\n\nThe new technology forgoes the mirrors. Instead, the spectrometer uses \u201can optical refractive index,\u201d which can be externally augmented using an electric field. No moving parts are necessary.\n\n\u201cVarying the refractive index has an effect similar to what happens when we move the mirrors, so this set-up lets us disperse the spectrum of the incident light in the same way,\u201d ETH researcher David Pohl said in a news release.\n\nScientists suggest the technology could be tweaked to measure other portions of the light spectrum.\n\n\u201cIn theory, our spectrometer lets you measure not only infrared light, but also visible light, provided the waveguide is properly configured,\u201d said researcher Marc Reig Escale\u0301.\n\nBecause it contains no moving parts, the device doesn\u2019t need to be constantly re-calibrated, making it easier and cheaper to use.\n\nFor the spectrometer chip, scientists used a material, thin-film lithium niobate, that is often used as a modulator in telecommunications. But because the material\u2019s waveguide properties trap light on the inside, researchers had to augment the film with tiny metal structures designed to scatter the light and let some of it escape. The light\u2019s spectral qualities can only be measured if some of the light can get out.\n\nWhile the new technology is small enough to fit in a mobile phone, scientists have yet to integrate the chip with an electronic device.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we\u2019re measuring the signal with an external camera, so if we want to have a compact device, we have to integrate this as well,\u201d said lead researcher Rachel Grange, a professor of optical nanomaterials at ETH Zurich.", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Scientists in Switzerland have developed an infrared spectrometer small enough to fit on a computer chip.
