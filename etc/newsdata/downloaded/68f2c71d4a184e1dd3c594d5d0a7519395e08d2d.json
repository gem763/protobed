It just wasn\u2019t a big deal, and that was the beauty of it all.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to detract from the importance of last night\u2019s coupling ceremony. In some ways, it was a big deal for Phoebe and Cassie. For one, Phoebe was obviously going against the grain in a normally-rigid, straight environment. Both islanders had also mentioned that they\u2019d never seriously dated girls in the past \u2013 even admitting their slight reservations in doing so \u2013 but ultimately chose to follow the attraction they unknowingly found in each other. Needless to say, it\u2019d take a lot of bravery to act on these desires on a national scale, let alone at all.\n\nWhen talking about their connection prior to the ceremony, the duo discussed the rise in people exploring their sexuality.\n\n\u201cThat many people are bi these days,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cNot even bi, just [having] no preference, I guess\u2026 that should be okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be labelled as anything,\u201d Phoebe added. \u201cJust make choices to figure out who you are and want you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Cassie responded, in a simple exchange that, to me, was powerful in diminishing labels.\n\nEveryone\u2019s reactions to their budding relationship inside the house were also extremely refreshing \u2013 it became, dare I say\u2026 a non-event (in the greatest way possible).\n\nI greatly underestimated Adam. I initially dismissed him as being an archetype of a blokey dude who\u2019d find these kinds of conversations uncomfortable. But he pushed for the relationship more than anyone else. To him, their inevitable coupling was a no-brainer, and he encouraged them to \u201chave a crack at it\u201d if they wanted to. (I now stan Adam so hard, and you should too.)\n\nFrom Adam\u2019s perspective, it was simple \u2013 if Cassie and Phoebe worked, then it worked, and if it didn\u2019t, well, at least they gave it a go. And it should be that simple \u2013 when all the labels and stigmas are removed from the equation, mutual attraction should be effortless.\n\nCassie and Phoebe\u2019s blossoming connection, as well as the other islanders\u2019 supportive and nonchalant reactions to it, is symbolic of our evolving attitudes towards exploring sexuality without the pressure of labels. I also feel like it was an important step forward in potentially helping those who may be wanting to experiment but are currently feeling held back by reservations.\n\nSafe to say, this episode made me, a fellow member of the bless\u00e8d LGBTQ+ community, proud of how far reality TV has come.", "description": "Last night\u2019s 'Love Island' saw Phoebe break the rules and couple with Cassie in one of the most refreshing takes on sexuality in Oz reality TV history.", "authors": ["Louis Hanson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Cassie-Phoebe-FB.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
