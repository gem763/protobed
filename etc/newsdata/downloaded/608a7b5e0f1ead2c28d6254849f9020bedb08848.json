Unlike previous debates, however, there are now two ways to reach the polling requirements also required to appear on the debate stage: Candidates can either receive 3 percent support in four qualifying national or single-state polls; or receive at least 5 percent support in two qualifying single-state polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and/or Nevada.\n\nThe donors must be dispersed throughout the country, as the DNC requires a minimum of 600 unique donors per state, in at least 20 states. The polls, both national and single-state, must have been released between Sept. 13 and Nov. 13.\n\nEight candidates have qualified for the November debate so far, including: Former vice president Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.); Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind.; Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.); billionaire activist Tom Steyer; and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nThe Post last hosted a presidential debate in March 2016 between Democratic candidates Sanders and Hillary Clinton, then sharing the moderating duties with Univision.\n\nModerators and a venue have yet to be named for the November debate. In addition to airing live on MSNBC, the debate will be live-streamed on MSNBC.com and The Post\u2019s digital platforms.", "description": "The fifth debate of the primary cycle will take place Nov. 20 in Georgia; eight candidates have qualified so far.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "October At Pm", "Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter.
