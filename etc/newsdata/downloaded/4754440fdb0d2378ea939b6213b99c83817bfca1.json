In a work camp, he meets Winnie the Pooh, who, the show explains, was banned after Chinese social media users pointed out his resemblance to Mr. Xi. (The Pooh censorship is real, and reporting on it got John Oliver censored last year.)\n\nMeanwhile in Colorado, the South Park children form a band, and a manager wants to make a biopic about them \u2014 but insists that their life story be told in a way that will be acceptable to Chinese censors, so they don\u2019t lose access to the market. He instructs the boys to cut references to the Dalai Lama (seen by the Chinese government as a separatist), organ transplants (China has been accused of harvesting prisoners\u2019 organs) and homosexuality (nothing is wrong with that subject \u201cunless you want to make money in China,\u201d he says).\n\nEventually the boys tire of the ordeal. \u201cI want to be proud of who we are, guys, and anyone who would betray their ideals just to make money in China isn\u2019t worth a lick of spit,\u201d says one of them, Stan.\n\n(The full episode is available online here, for those with a high tolerance for profanity.)\n\nThe N.B.A. is hardly the first international business to make concessions to China\u2019s political sensitivities as it seeks access to its lucrative market, or to forcefully apologize after running afoul of them. Movie studios, especially, have worked to ensure that their scripts aren\u2019t at odds with state censors, lest they lose billions in potential business.\n\nDisney, for one, earned $858 million for \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d in the United States and an additional $614 million from China. Moviegoers in China bought an estimated $8.87 billion in movie tickets last year, according to box office analysts.\n\nThe \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode mocked Disney by turning a Mickey Mouse look-alike into a craven profit seeker. On his flight to China, Randy Marsh was surrounded by characters from \u201cAvengers\u201d and \u201cStar Wars,\u201d along with N.B.A. players.", "description": "\u201cLike the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\u201d the show\u2019s creators said in a tongue-in-cheek response. \u201cWe too love money more than freedom and democracy.\u201d", "authors": ["Daniel Victor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/08/world/08china-southpark-1sub/08china-southpark-1sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
