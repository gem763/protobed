While Fifa 20 is mostly very good, the issue of card-purchased loot boxes in its most popular mode, Ultimate Team, has led to calls for the game to be classified as gambling.\n\nA recap, for those unaware of the brouhaha: in Ultimate Team, you building a fantasy squad by opening loot box-style packs of individual player cards. You can use in-game currency to buy these packs, or do so using real money \u2013 but the chances of finding Messi, Ronaldo or Salah are \u2026 well, we don\u2019t know, because EA doesn\u2019t disclose unambiguous odds. There\u2019s your first problem.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Keen to deliver big, memorable moments \u2026 Fifa 20. Photograph: Electronic Arts\n\nThe second is that this is a family-rated game, with teenagers around the globe spending money they don\u2019t necessarily have chasing cards they\u2019ll likely never get. In Belgium cash sales ceased in January, but elsewhere it\u2019s business as usual. Some plan to boycott until EA makes pack odds clearer or implements an age rating, as neither is present here.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t all weighted one way. For those disciplined enough to avoid micro-transactions, Ultimate Team remains the best mode in all of sports gaming. Squad building challenges \u2013 in which you complete puzzles to earn superior cards \u2013 rely on skill rather than luck, and savvy use of the transfer market earns top players without spending a penny. A new XP system, where everything you do builds towards rewards such as Wilfried Zaha or Lucas V\u00e1zquez, also eliminates fortune from the equation.\n\nPlus, for anyone weaned on Panini collections, opening packs is the most euphoric part: to remove any chance of randomly unearthing last season\u2019s top scorer or your club\u2019s cult hero would be to disarm the mode\u2019s magic. Change seems inescapable, but an age gate feels like a more balanced compromise. Finishing your album never felt quite so fun when ordering specific stickers direct from the manufacturer.\n\nJudge Fifa for its on-field abilities and you discover a football sim keen to deliver big, memorable moments: crazy, mazy dribbles and thunderbolts arrowed into the top corner. Defending is difficult, and 0-0 draws as rare as a VAR-free Match Of The Day episode. There\u2019s no attempt to match PES 2020\u2019s cerebral passing game: Fifa 20 is all-action all the time. It won\u2019t suit purists, but the just-one-more-game pull at 11pm when you have work/college/school the next day is gravity-strong.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Outrageous and hilarious \u2026 Fifa 20\u2019s new Volta mode. Photograph: Electronic Arts\n\nThis is particularly true of Volta mode. Inspired by fan requests to exhume the Fifa Street series, it enables teams of six or fewer players to do battle in small arenas based on real locations. And it\u2019s superb. Claustrophobic pitches prevent pace being overpowered, and passing and shooting are reassuringly snappy \u2013 while skill moves are equal parts outrageous and hilarious. You\u2019ll chuckle at some of the celebrations, too. When was the last time a Fifa game successfully delivered humour?\n\nWill playing Fifa create a new generation of smarter footballers? Read more\n\nVolta is best enjoyed using real-world teams, but its bespoke story mode also hosts light-hearted build-a-player amusement, albeit without the subtle performances that made Alex Hunter\u2019s The Journey tale so likeable across Fifas 17 to 19. That, sadly, is gone \u2013 though some of its best elements now inform career mode.\n\nFor much of Fifa\u2019s history, career mode was the series\u2019 focus, yet this decade it\u2019s taken on the mantle of sacrificial lamb to Ultimate Team\u2019s more immediate dream-team thrills. As such any kind of upgrade is welcome, and being able to converse interactively with squad members and the press \u2013 as occurred in The Journey \u2013 does break up the match-match-match grind. Variable potential ratings for young players add longevity, too.\n\nWhatever your mode of choice, the usual array of authentic teams and kits are included, with a noteworthy exception: Juventus are now exclusive to rival, Pro Evo, and rebranded Piemonte Calcio. Although player faces aren\u2019t affected, it\u2019s certainly curious to see Cristiano Ronaldo charging round in Sunday league garb. Still, one missing licence shouldn\u2019t go down as a game-breaker. The new additions to Fifa 20 elevate it above \u201cstandard annual update\u201d fare.", "description": "The all-action football sim includes a superb new six-a-side Volta mode and the controversial, pay-for Ultimate Team", "authors": ["Ben Wilson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f31a984f332c69d77cf0ac694e7c1588b03d72/876_255_6411_3847/master/6411.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ad7ecf630060cbfd36c788b04de97b1d", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
