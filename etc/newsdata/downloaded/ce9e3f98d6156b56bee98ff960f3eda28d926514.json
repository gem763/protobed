Officials said their top priority was expanding those fire breaks substantially before extreme winds return to the region.\n\nIn northern California, where firefighters struggled for a fifth day against a 75,000-acre blaze in Sonoma County\u2019s wine-growing region, high-wind forecasts prompted Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PCG.N) to institute a new wave of prescribed blackouts for nearly 600,000 homes and business.\n\nThat includes about 400,000 customers already blacked out in a \u201cpublic safety power shut-off\u201d that PG&E instituted three days earlier, the company said in a statement. Tuesday\u2019s power cuts marked the third series of mass blackouts implemented this month by PG&E, the state\u2019s largest investor-owned utility, in response to \u201cred flag\u201d warnings of extreme fire hazards.\n\nUtilities serving Southern California\u2019s more highly urbanized areas have imposed smaller-scale outages.\n\nAnnouncing preliminary findings by its arson investigators into the origins of the Getty fire, the Los Angeles Fire Department said the blaze was likely caused by a tree branch that snapped off in high winds and landed on adjacent power lines, produced sparks and \u201carcing\u201d that ignited nearby brush.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nThe lines, which are operated by the city\u2019s Department of Water and Power, remained intact, the statement said.\n\nPG&E, which filed for bankruptcy in January citing $30 billion in potential liability from a series of deadly fires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018, also has been implicated in the latest Sonoma County blaze, dubbed the Kincade fire.\n\nThe utility acknowledged last week the Kincade fire broke out near a damaged PG&E transmission tower at about the time a live high-voltage line carried by that tower malfunctioned.", "description": "A broken tree branch blown into power lines by high winds likely sparked the wildfire that has driven thousands of residents from their homes around the famed Getty Center museum in Los Angeles, the city fire department said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446350695&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T00M", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
