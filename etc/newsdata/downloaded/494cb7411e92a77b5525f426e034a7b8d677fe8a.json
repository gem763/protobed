Instead, ranking for top-watched music videos will be based on organic plays, according to a new blog post. Running music videos as advertisements in front of other YouTube videos has become common practice within the music industry since it can be counted as a view if it\u2019s watched for a long enough amount of time.\n\nThis will help address calculated advertising campaigns that are launched specifically to land a music video on YouTube\u2019s charts during the first 24 hours of being published. YouTube\u2019s blog post acknowledges that people use these stats \u2014 many often touting record-breaking 24-hour views \u2014 as a \u201cdefinitive representation of its instant cultural impact,\u201d and it wants to ensure those numbers are accurate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor and one we take very seriously,\u201d the blog post reads. \u201cAs we look to maintain consistency and credibility across our platform, we\u2019ve made some necessary revisions to our methodology for reporting 24-hour record debuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor and one we take very seriously.\u201d\n\nThe new changes mean that videos eligible for record debuts must come from organic sources, including \u201cdirect links to the video, search results, external sites that embed the video and YouTube features like the homepage, watch next and Trending,\u201d according to the blog post.\n\nYouTube\u2019s music chart system has faced a few controversies over the last few months. In July, Indian rapper Badshah broke the record for most views in 24 hours, beating out BTS with 75 million views to their 74.6 million just months earlier. But people suspected that the rapper\u2019s view total was inflated with artificial views. Bloomberg later reported that Badshah and his team purchased advertisements that either embedded or promoted the video. This led to a dramatically increased view count. YouTube decided not to acknowledge the record-breaking numbers.\n\n\u201cVideo advertising is an effective way to reach specific audiences with a song debut, but paid advertising views on YouTube will no longer be considered when looking at a 24-hour record debut,\u201d the blog post reads.\n\nSimilar tactics are often used by movie studios and TV networks that fight for record-breaking numbers, but those won\u2019t be impacted. A YouTube spokesperson told The Verge that the change \u201cis focused on aligning YouTube Music Charts and records with the industry standard and how we report to Nielsen and other third party charting companies.\u201d The company isn\u2019t making any platform-wide changes.", "description": "YouTube is introducing a major change to its music chart system after discovering that artists and labels were using growth hacks to inflate how many people were watching their videos, and is no longer counting \"advertising views\" when it comes to the company calculating its music charts.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/158mH0syv5pW6iJrn6AnT_VNmts=/0x426:5948x3540/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19196534/1167018018.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
