It works well enough, but has serious limitations. In practice it\u2019s a bit like playing Marco Polo. The drone has a general sense of where you are, but can\u2019t actually see you or the world around it. With just GPS to rely on, drones struggled to adjust for sudden changes in direction or speed, to keep subjects in frame when in close range \u2014 and of course, to avoid obstacles like trees, lampposts, and ski lifts.\n\nEventually he taps on tree. The Phantom 4 cruises towards it, adjusting slightly to avoid the obstacle. The end result is a dramatic shot, with the drone splitting the difference between two trees, sunset shining on their outstretched branches, passing far closer than I would have felt comfortable with if I was the one in control.\n\nThe drone takes off, hovering a few feet off the ground. I guide it up to about 12 feet with the throttle on the remote control. Then my three year old son takes over. He taps the screen on an iPad running our piloting app. The drone, a DJI Phantom 4, begins to ascend, heading towards an abandoned grainery. My son happily taps away at the screen, shifting the drone here and there. You wouldn\u2019t notice how frantically he\u2019s tapping from the footage he captured, which is buttery smooth.\n\nTrying to crash made me physically ill I spent the last few days putting the Phantom 4 through its paces, spending most of my time on the brand new fully autonomous features. It took me a while to get up the courage to fly it full throttle at a wall, and I felt physically sick with fear when I did, but the unit never failed to sense a crash and come to a halt. It picked out brick walls, trees, even chain link fences. Along with obstacle avoidance, the Phantom 4 can be flown simply by tapping on your screen, as my son did. And it can use its computer vision to identify a specific person and follow them, keeping the subject of your film perfectly in frame.

DJI\u2019s Phantom has been our favorite model of drone for the last few years, but this latest version doesn\u2019t merely hold onto the mantle as the best unit you can buy. By adding computer vision and fully autonomous capabilities, the Phantom 4 has dramatically raised the bar on what is possible with a consumer caliber camera drone, both for complete amateurs who want to start flying and for professionals who are crafting complex and dangerous shots.\n\nThe basics of the Phantom hardware maintain the high quality of previous editions with some small tweaks and improvements. TL;DR, it is still the best overall drone in terms of reliable flight, beautiful footage, and overall build quality. If you want to dig into the nitty gritty, the rest of this section if for you. Way easier to carry For starters, the Phantom 4 comes with a new carrying case, a grey styrofoam suitcase which looks like it should be holding the key codes for a nuclear submarine. It\u2019s far more compact and durable than what came with the Phantom 3, which just had a handle on its cardboard box.

It\u2019s far more compact and durable than what came with the Phantom 3, which just had a handle on its cardboard box. In our testing, battery life averaged above 25 minutes, which is equal or better than comparably sized camera drones. It went from empty to fully charged in an hour. The remote control can be charged at the same time as the battery and in our testing lasted through three full flights without a problem. The new Phantom has a glossy plastic frame and a thinner, more aerodynamic body. The colored bands are gone from the arms, which now end in shiny metal on the exposed motors. It\u2019s belly is grey plastic, which is a nice break from the all white design. From a distance it\u2019s impossible to tell apart from previous editions, but from up close it\u2019s a slightly more aggressive and attractive design. The controller is identical to previous editions, except it traded out a matte plastic for a shiny coat to match its drone. Mmmmmm, shiny Assembly is basically the same, except now the rotors have a new locking mechanism. DJI says it needed a stronger connection to keep the rotors from flying off in \"sport mode\" (more on that later.) The end results is just as simple \u2014 and quite a bit faster \u2014 the the previous assembly method. The battery is a bit bigger but otherwise identical. It snaps into place snugly and detaches easily.\n\nThe Phantom 4 now essentially operates at three speeds. When you have object avoidance turned on, it tops out at a little above 22 miles per hour. In normal flight mode it can reach 35 miles an hour, and in the new sport mode it can fly at an astonishing 45 miles per hour. For experienced pilots, sport mode is a real treat, adding a lot of horsepower and agility to the craft. For professional camera operators sport mode will enable a lot more dynamic chase shots while filming high speed stunts or races. Like a tripod in the sky DJI claims the Phantom 4 is five times more stable than its predecessor, and in our testing it delivered incredibly smooth footage. While hovering it never had an issue holding its exact position to within an inch or two, even in moderate winds. The extra stability come courtesy of an additional IMU, and double the number of downward facing cameras and sonar sensors, which the Phantom uses for its visual positioning system. When executing an automatic return to its home position the craft always landed within a few inches of its takeoff position.

Much nicer footage The Phantom 4 uses the same remote controller and Lightbridge video downlink technology as the Phantom 3. In our testing it never lost connection and the video stream was extremely clear and free of lag. I don\u2019t have an expert eye for film, but according to our video team the footage from the Phantom 4 was a big improvement. It looked more \"raw\" \u2014 a higher dynamic range, less digital sharpening, and less saturation \u2014 all perks that give you more flexibility when editing and coloring the footage later on.

All the intelligent flight modes found on the Phantom 3 \u2014 waypoint navigation, orbit, follow, and track \u2014 are available here as well. They still rely on GPS and haven\u2019t changed much, although I found them a little bit more accurate at close range. Given the new autonomous features available, however, you probably won\u2019t rely on this mode for anything but waypoint navigation.\n\nThe Phantom 4's forward facing optical sensor\n\nAll of those improvements are great, but it\u2019s the autonomous features that are the huge change with the Phantom 4, so let\u2019s dig in deep. It\u2019s clear that there are still big limitations. The coolest new feature by far is TapFly. You have a live feed from the drone\u2019s main camera on the screen of your mobile device. Tap anywhere on that image and the drone will fly in that direction. The drone will automatically ease into turns, avoiding the jerky motion that I often got in my footage while flying manually. Autonomy allows safe, easy, but limited flight The limitation here is that you are mostly moving in one direction \u2014 forward _ which is the only direction in which the obstacle avoidance works. The sensors have a 60 degree field of view, meaning you can only turn at a roughly 30 degree angle, all the while moving forward. If you want to execute a tight turn or head back the way you came from, you\u2019ll need to get on the control sticks or use the automatic \"return to home\" function. The obstacle avoidance is quite cautious. Sometimes when I asked it to navigate through a stand of trees with a few feet of clearance on either side, it refused. TapFly also declined to work when you were too low, for example right after an automatic takeoff. That meant I had to touch the sticks a little before switching over to rely totally on the screen of my mobile device. The other big autonomous feature is AutoTrack. You select a subject \u2014 a person, a bike, a car \u2014 and the drone will lock on and keep them in the center of the frame. It does this using the same computer vision technology employed for obstacle avoidance, except this time it\u2019s building a 3D model not just of the environment, but also of the target you want to track. Tracking and orbiting a subject is awesome Subject tracking was great when it worked, but typically took several tries before locking on. It would often say the subject was too small, or too far away. I found it worked best when you were ten or twelve feet from your target. It was very good at following a single person, but would lose them if they crossed paths with another person wearing similar colors, or if the person you chose wandered into a group.

While in Autotrack, you could also initiate an orbit simply by holding the stick to the left or right. This is a tricky maneuver, even for an experienced pilot, and it can lead to terrific footage. I found it worked really well when the subject was standing still. If the subject was moving, however, the orbit seemed a bit unpredictable. Since the Phantom 4 can only see in front of itself, you need to watch for obstacles while orbiting, and I could easily imagine a rookie pilot misjudging the width of a circling drone trying to track a moving target.", "description": "The drone takes off, hovering a few feet off the ground.
