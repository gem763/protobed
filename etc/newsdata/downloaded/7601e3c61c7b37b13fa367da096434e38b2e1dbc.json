The defamation suit centers on tweets where Musk called the caver, Vernon Unsworth, a \u201cpedo guy.\u201d Musk also sent emails to BuzzFeed journalist Ryan Mac, which are now part of the case.\n\nA jury will decide whether those tweets and emails count as recklessly negligent, US District Judge Stephen Wilson ruled.\n\nThe debacle began during a Thai rescue operation, when a group of boys were trapped in a cave. Musk, along with some of his engineers, built a mini submarine that they sent to Thailand. Unsworth dismissed the mini sub in a CNN interview as a \u201cPR stunt,\u201d and said Musk could \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts.\u201d In response, Musk tweeted several things, culminating in a now-deleted, \u201cSorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d Musk apologized. Then, a month later, he called Unsworth a \u201cchild rapist\u201d in an email to Mac.\n\n\u201cI fucking hope he sues me,\u201d Musk wrote in an email to Mac. Unsworth did.\n\nApparently after his initial tweets, Musk hired a private investigator to dig into Unsworth\u2019s past, according to court documents filed earlier this month. That private investigator, however, was a convicted felon. In an email to Mac, Musk said Unsworth had married a 12-year-old in Thailand. According to Unsworth, that isn\u2019t even what the private investigator told Musk. Unsworth says he met his wife in London \u2014 and she was 32 at the time.", "description": "Elon Musk\u2019s request to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by a caver was denied by a Los Angeles judge today, Bloomberg reported.
