We believe it is a growing market and it has lots of great growth ahead of it.\n\n\"We also know that great American brands have been successful. Burger brands have been unbelievably successful there. But we believe that we can challenge those brands.\"\n\nWendy's has more than 6,700 outlets in 30 countries around the world including the Americas, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nPringle said the company has been researching the UK as a location for more than a year, adding: \"We are going there with our eyes wide open and with a lot of insights and preparation.\n\n\"We have done landmark research with thousands of consumers in the UK. We have talked to them and engaged with them and what they think about the Wendy's brand.\"\n\nThe company said it wants to open about 20 outlets in Britain, starting in the next 12 to 18 months.", "description": "It's a name we all know from movies and TV, but you might soon get the chance to find out what it's all about after top executives at Wendy's revealed plans to launch in the UK", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18921175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Caucasian-woman-eating-cheeseburger.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
