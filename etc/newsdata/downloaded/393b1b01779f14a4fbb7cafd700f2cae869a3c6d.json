We have to face up to it.\"\n\nScotland have bounced back from a 27-3 drubbing by Ireland in their opening game to smash Samoa 34-0 and Russia 61-0.\n\nBut a Japanese side that left Ireland seeing stars brings a different set of challenges.\n\n\"We know it wouldn't be an embarrassment to lose to Japan,\" said Townsend, striking a more conciliatory tone.\n\n\"We know they are an excellent side and we will have to play very well to win.\"\n\nTeams:\n\nJapan\n\n15 William Tupou, 14 Kotaro Matsushima, 13 Timothy Lafaele, 12 Ryoto Nakamura, 11 Kenki Fukuoka, 10 Yu Tamura, 9 Yutaka Nagare, 8 Kazuki Himeno, 7 Pieter Labuschagne, 6 Michael Leitch (captain), 5 James Moore, 4 Luke Thompson, 3 Jiwon Koo, 2 Shota Horie, 1 Keita Inagaki.\n\n\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Atsushi Sakate, 17 Isileli Nakajima, 18 Asaeli Ai Valu, 19 Uwe Helu, 20 Hendrik Tui, 21 Fumiaki Tanaka, 22 Rikiya Matsuda, 23 Ryohei Yamanaka.\n\n\n\nScotland\n\n15 Stuart Hogg, 14 Tommy Seymour, 13 Chris Harris, 12 Sam Johnson, 11 Darcy Graham, 10 Finn Russell, 9 Greig Laidlaw (captain), 8 Blade Thomson, 7 Jamie Ritchie, 6 Magnus Bradbury, 5 Jonny Gray, 4 Grant Gilchrist, 3 WP Nel, 2 Fraser Brown, 1 Allan Dell.\n\n\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Stuart McInally, 17 Gordon Reid, 18 Zander Fagerson, 19 Scott Cummings, 20 Ryan Wilson, 21 George Horne, 22 Pete Horne, 23 Blair Kinghorn", "description": "An angry war of words between Japan and Scotland has injected an element of needle into their typhoon-threatened Rugby World Cup clash.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9341/605cadfd31754d9d869f6cbfc71dc8e6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
