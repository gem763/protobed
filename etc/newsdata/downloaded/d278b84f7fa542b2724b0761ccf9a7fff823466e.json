Ken Martin is sounding the alarm.", "language": "en", "text": "But here\u2019s the upshot of this in the real world: Trump is largely dominating the field when it comes to spending right now. And an opportunity may be passing by to deliver Trump some debilitating blows at a moment of uncommon vulnerability, as new revelations tumble out daily and impeachment gains public support.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne Democrat is loudly sounding the alarm about this.\n\nIn an interview, Ken Martin \u2014 the president of the Association of State Democratic Committees \u2014 told me that many Democrats in the battleground states and operatives involved with state parties are worried about this imbalance in spending.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of resources being raised is not being spent against Donald Trump right now,\u201d Martin, who is also the chair of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota, a Democratic-leaning state that Trump is heavily contesting, told me. \u201cWho\u2019s taking Trump on?\u201d\n\nWith Trump preparing to spend $10 million on ads right now designed to muddy the waters in the impeachment fight, much of it expected to go toward blasting Biden, the Daily Beast recently compared the sum totals of both sides\u2019 spending and concluded that Democrats are getting \u201ctorched by Trump in the impeachment ad wars.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is some ad spending coming from groups such as Tom Steyer\u2019s Need to Impeach, the Daily Beast reported, but groups like Priorities USA \u2014 the hulk of Democratic super PACs \u2014 don\u2019t want to expend huge resources responding directly to Trump\u2019s latest broadsides, to preserve resources for later, which they hope to focus on Trump\u2019s failures on kitchen-table issues.\n\nExacerbating this situation is Trump\u2019s willingness to traffic in rank disinformation and propaganda. For instance, Trump\u2019s ad attacking Biden claims Biden tried to remove a prosecutor targeting his son (a lie) and insisting that Democrats want to impeach him merely because he opposed \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine (also a lie).\n\nThis is creating a massive disinformation asymmetry. \u201cThere\u2019s no one really pushing back on that in any way through paid communications right now,\u201d Martin told me. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a real challenge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMartin candidly noted that the result of this is that the Trump campaign is making a \u201chuge investment\u201d in having an \u201con-the-ground conversation\u201d with general-election voters, which \u201cthe Democratic ecosystem writ large just isn\u2019t doing right now.\u201d\n\nMartin added that in his conversations with numerous state party chairs, including in battleground states, he picked up worry about feeling \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by Trump and GOP spending.\n\n\u201cWe should be taking Trump on at every step of the way,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWhile he\u2019s vulnerable, this is an opportunity for us to really start defining him.\u201d\n\nMartin stressed that he\u2019s not blaming any particular institution in the party for this state of affairs, noting that the leading Democratic presidential candidates, who are raising massive sums, are sucking up a great deal of resources right now. Instead, he faulted the \u201cecosystem\u201d of Democratic Party politics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"The bulk of our resources are tied up in this nominating process,\u201d Martin said. He And he noted that the Democratic National Committee has done good work in helping to fortify the infrastructure of state parties in preparation for the general election.\n\nFor its part, the DNC sees that as a core mission. It has launched a new initiative designed to create a massive corps of young volunteers for 2020 and another initiative helping state parties localize Trump\u2019s policy failures. It\u2019s also pressuring media companies not to broadcast Trump\u2019s false ads.\n\n\"Democrats are working every day to define and localize the impacts of Trump\u2019s broken promises, and the DNC is making historic investments now across the battlegrounds to ensure our eventual nominee has the infrastructure they need to defeat Trump in 2020,\u201d said David Bergstein, the DNC\u2019s director of battleground state communications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt may be that the current imbalance is the result of a confluence of unusual factors: Trump\u2019s massive fundraising (his campaign has already hauled in $100 million); the large Democratic field and the success of its leading candidates in raising money, inhaling a lot of resources; and Trump\u2019s willingness to flood the media zone with a level of disinformation propaganda that will dwarf what we saw in 2016.\n\nMartin put it bluntly: \u201cRight now he has unfettered ability to get his message out.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump is vastly outspending Democrats in the impeachment ad wars.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0hmNpWVmhPyHw3_0_odABkRvD6s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M3PSATHPNAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
