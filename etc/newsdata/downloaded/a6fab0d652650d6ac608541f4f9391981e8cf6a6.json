The icon next to their name on television and on the scoreboards in the stadium is the \u201cIAAF\u201d logo of track\u2019s federation instead of the Russian flag.\n\nThere\u2019s no getting used to being a neutral, says Mariya Lasitskene, who\u2019s been here before when she won the high jump world title in 2017. Her anthem wasn\u2019t played.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s used to it. Everyone\u2019s worried and nervous. It\u2019s not nice. You want to be in a different uniform, and not to see IAAF next to your surname,\u201d she said after qualifying for the final Friday.\n\nWearing subdued blacks and grays, Russia\u2019s athletes dress like they\u2019re modeling generic sportswear. A vetting process has kept out past stars with a history of drug use, so the team in Doha is just 30 athletes. Lasitskene is the only reigning champion, but Russians are also targeting medals in men\u2019s high jump and the 110-meter hurdles.\n\nNearly four years into its ban from track and field, much longer than in any other sport, Russia dared hope it might once again send a full team to this year\u2019s championships. Instead, Russian track is battling a new wave of scandals.\n\nThis year has seen banned coaches still working, forged medical documents and - most damagingly of all - evidence revealed Monday that data on past offenses was tampered with before Russian law enforcement handed it over in January. The World Anti-Doping Agency is investigating and could place further restrictions on Russia across multiple sports ahead of next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nLasitskene is already taking precautions.\n\nIf WADA suspends Russia\u2019s anti-doping agency, she\u2019ll move abroad - though \u201cdefinitely not to the U.S.\u201d - to show she\u2019s under a rigorous testing program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d be going to train, and I\u2019ll underline that. To train, not to change nationality,\u201d she said. \u201cTraining abroad might very well be needed, because I don\u2019t want to miss the Olympics a second time.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Lasitskene was a contender for Olympic gold, but she was barred along with almost all of the Russian squad. The winning height of 1.97 meters was easily within her range.\n\nThe IAAF hoped a ban would prevent a repeat of the widespread cheating at the 2013 championships in Moscow by forcing Russia to develop a new, clean generation of athletes. But young athletes have been implicated too.\n\nOf the six Russians who won medals at the last world championships in 2017, two have since been stripped of the neutral athlete status which allows them to compete internationally. Race walk silver medalist Sergei Shirobokov was found at a secret training camp in Kyrgyzstan with a coach banned for life for blood doping.\n\nThe case of another 2017 medalist, high jumper Danil Lysenko, won\u2019t go away. After he missed three drug tests, he faced a ban. In his defense, the Russian track federation produced medical documents apparently showing he had been too ill to test.\n\nAfter suspicions were raised about the apparently non-existent clinic named on the documents, the IAAF\u2019s Russia task force reports Lysenko later confessed the documents were fake. He said top officials from the Russian track federation \u201cconspired with him to obtain and provide those documents.\u201d The task force added he \u201csubsequently recanted that allegation.\u201d\n\nBeing neutral doesn\u2019t make the Russian athletes independent of their doping-tainted federation, which still decides team selections and coaching appointments.\n\nThat means few Russian athletes are willing to speak out about the federation\u2019s slow pace of reform. As Russia\u2019s sole world champion, Lasitskene\u2019s fame brings her more freedom, which she used in June to call for mass resignations of Russian officials and doping-tainted coaches.\n\nThe neutrals have been given a code of conduct for the world championships - no flags, no singing the anthem, no facepaint or nail varnish in Russian red, white and blue.\n\nAfter three seasons traveling the world as a neutral, Lasitskene knows the rules inside out. \u201cEveryone\u2019s knows what\u2019s what.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "At the world track championships, it's as if the world's biggest country simply doesn't exist.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/qatar_athletics_worlds_73961_c0-12-4073-2386_s1770x1032.jpg?c723cf294e8dbb409750e8a7a58487eedcdefaa6", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
