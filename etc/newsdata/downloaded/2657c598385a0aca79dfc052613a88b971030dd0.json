Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyTrump instructed administration to withhold military aid for Ukraine days before call with president: report Murphy blasts GOP on whistleblower response: 'We're watching this country turn into a banana republic' Let's get real: Democrats were first to enlist Ukraine in US elections MORE (D-Conn.) delivered a pointed message to Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nWhile choosing his words carefully, Murphy made clear \u2014 by his own account \u2014 that Ukraine currently enjoyed bipartisan support for its U.S. aid but that could be jeopardized if the new president acquiesced to requests by President Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump mocks Romney with video contrasting their presidential bids Murphy blasts GOP on whistleblower response: 'We're watching this country turn into a banana republic' GOP senator: Releasing transcript of Trump-Ukraine call would set 'dangerous precedent' MORE, to investigate past corruption allegations involving Americans, including former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump instructed administration to withhold military aid for Ukraine days before call with president: report More Democrats threaten impeachment over Trump's dealings with Ukraine Seven Freshman Democrats pen op-ed urging Congress to impeach Trump if new allegations are true MORE\u2019s family.\n\nMurphy boasted after the meeting that he told the new Ukrainian leader that U.S. aid was his country\u2019s \u201cmost important asset\u201d and it would be viewed as election-meddling and \u201cdisastrous for long-term U.S.-Ukraine relations\u201d to bend to the wishes of Trump and Giuliani.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I told Zelensky that he should not insert himself or his government into American politics. I cautioned him that complying with the demands of the President's campaign representatives to investigate a political rival of the President would gravely damage the U.S.-Ukraine relationship. There are few things that Republicans and Democrats agree on in Washington these days, and support for Ukraine is one of them,\" Murphy told me today, confirming what he told Ukraine's leader.\n\nThe implied message did not require an interpreter for Zelensky to understand: Investigate the Ukraine dealings of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and you jeopardize Democrats' support for future U.S. aid to Kiev.\n\nThe Murphy anecdote is a powerful reminder that, since at least 2016, Democrats repeatedly have exerted pressure on Ukraine, a key U.S. ally for buffering Russia, to meddle in U.S. politics and elections.\n\nAnd that activity long preceded Giuliani\u2019s discussions with Ukrainian officials and Trump\u2019s phone call to Zelensky in July, seeking to have Ukraine formally investigate whether then-Vice President Joe Biden used a threat of canceling foreign aid to shut down an investigation into $3 million routed to the U.S. firm run by Biden\u2019s son.\n\nAs I have reported, the pressure began at least as early as January 2016, when the Obama White House unexpectedly invited Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutors to Washington to discuss fighting corruption in the country.\n\nThe meeting, promised as training, turned out to be more of a pretext for the Obama administration to pressure Ukraine\u2019s prosecutors to drop an investigation into the Burisma Holdings gas company that employed Hunter Biden and to look for new evidence in a then-dormant criminal case against eventual Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortLet's get real: Democrats were first to enlist Ukraine in US elections Graham: Trump should be 'as transparent as possible' about Ukraine call Ukraine could badly damage both Donald Trump and the Democrats MORE, a GOP lobbyist.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nU.S. officials \u201ckept talking about how important it was that all of our anti-corruption efforts be united,\u201d said Andrii Telizhenko, the former political officer in the Ukrainian embassy in Washington who organized and attended the meetings.\n\nNazar Kholodnytsky, Ukraine\u2019s chief anti-corruption prosecutor, told me that, soon after he returned from the Washington meeting, he saw evidence in Ukraine of political meddling in the U.S. election. That's when two top Ukrainian officials released secret evidence to the American media, smearing Manafort.\n\nThe release of the evidence forced Manafort to step down as Trump\u2019s top campaign adviser. A Ukrainian court concluded last December that the release of the evidence amounted to an unlawful intervention in the U.S. election by Kiev\u2019s government, although that ruling has since been overturned on a technicality.\n\nShortly after the Ukrainian prosecutors returned from their Washington meeting, a new round of Democratic pressure was exerted on Ukraine \u2014 this time via its embassy in Washington.\n\nValeriy Chaly, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States at the time, confirmed to me in a statement issued by his office that, in March 2016, a contractor for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) pressed his embassy to try to find any Russian dirt on Trump and Manafort that might reside in Ukraine\u2019s intelligence files.\n\nThe DNC contractor also asked Chaly's team to try to persuade Ukraine\u2019s president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, to make a statement disparaging Manafort when the Ukrainian leader visited the United States during the 2016 election.\n\nChaly said his embassy rebuffed both requests because it recognized they were improper efforts to get a foreign government to try to influence the election against Trump and for Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTrump mocks Romney with video contrasting their presidential bids Whistleblower fuels impeachment talk Let's get real: Democrats were first to enlist Ukraine in US elections MORE.\n\nThe political pressure continued. Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in crucial U.S. aid to Kiev if Poroshenko did not fire the country\u2019s chief prosecutor. Ukraine would have been bankrupted without the aid, so Poroshenko obliged on March 29, 2016, and fired Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin.\n\nAt the time, Biden was aware that Shokin\u2019s office was investigating Burisma, the firm employing Hunter Biden, after a December 2015 New York Times article.\n\nWhat wasn\u2019t known at the time, Shokin told me recently, was that Ukrainian prosecutors were preparing a request to interview Hunter Biden about his activities and the monies he was receiving from Ukraine. If such an interview became public during the middle of the 2016 election, it could have had enormous negative implications for Democrats.\n\nDemocrats continued to tap Ukraine for Trump dirt throughout the 2016 election, my reporting shows.\n\nNellie Ohr, the wife of senior U.S. Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, worked in 2016 as a contractor for Fusion GPS, the same Hillary Clinton-funded opposition research firm that hired Christopher Steele, the British spy who wrote the now-debunked dossier linking Trump to Russia collusion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNellie Ohr testified to Congress that some of the dirt she found on Trump during her 2016 election opposition research came from a Ukrainian parliament member. She also said that she eventually took the information to the FBI through her husband \u2014 another way Ukraine got inserted into the 2016 election.\n\nPolitics. Pressure. Opposition research. All were part of the Democrats\u2019 playbook on Ukraine long before Trump ever called Zelensky this summer. And as Sen. Murphy\u2019s foray earlier this month shows, it hasn\u2019t stopped.\n\nThe evidence is so expansive as to strain the credulity of the Democrats\u2019 current outrage at Trump\u2019s behavior with Ukraine.\n\nWhich raises a question: Could it be the Ukraine tale currently being weaved by Democrats and their allies in the media is nothing more than a smoke screen designed to distract us from the forthcoming Justice Department inspector general report into abuses during the Democratic-inspired Russia collusion probe?\n\nIt\u2019s a question worth asking.\n\nJohn Solomon is an award-winning investigative journalist whose work over the years has exposed U.S. and FBI intelligence failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, federal scientists\u2019 misuse of foster children and veterans in drug experiments, and numerous cases of political corruption.
