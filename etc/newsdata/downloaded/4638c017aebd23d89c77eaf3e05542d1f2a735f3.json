Get behind the wheel and really go somewhere \u2013 preferably a substantial distance, because there\u2019s something about road trips that makes them the perfect \u201creal\u201d travel experience.\n\nOf course, the United States can claim to be the birthplace of road trips and Route 66 undoubtedly tops the list of dream blacktop adventures, even if the original route no longer exists.\n\nMy foray along the Mother Road was in the 1990s and in a totally appropriate vehicle \u2013 a 1950s Cadillac with no brakes to speak of, but a cigarette lighter for every seat. Six of them.\n\nTony Wheeler with the trusty Cadillac at Mel\u2019s Drive-in, San Francisco.\n\nAsian road trips have a special place on my travel lists, as it was a drive along the Hippie Trail of the \u201970s that relocated me to Australia and led to the creation of Lonely Planet.\n\nAfghanistan might have killed that route today, but only two years ago I was delighted to traverse a modern-day replacement: the Silk Road across China, central Asia (all those \u2019stans), Iran and Turkey, then into Europe. The four-month trip was also in a suitable vehicle: a nearly 50-year-old MG MGB sports car. Road trips are definitely better when the vehicle is best defined as \u201cnot very sensible\u201d.\n\nAfrica has several high-quality road trip entrants, with the top-to-tail Cairo to Cape Town adventure heading my list. I\u2019ve never done the whole thing, although I have ventured onto plenty of African roads in plenty of different vehicles.\n\nPlus, I\u2019ve spent two weeks on two wheels when I joined the Tanzania and Malawi stage of the annual Tour d\u2019Afrique bicycle ride. Every January a group of 50 or so cyclists \u2013 some of remarkably mature age \u2013 pedal past the pyramids and four months later, all going well, arrive at the southern tip of South Africa.\n\nLatin America\u2019s equivalent is the Gringo Trail starting in Mexico, although real enthusiasts make that an excursion from the Arctic Circle in Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in Argentina, even if one section, the Darien Gap in Panama, is still impassable.", "description": "As one of the best-travelled people on earth, Lonely Planet co-founder Tony Wheeler knows a thing or two about hitting the road.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4227%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_862/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b4ffb230bbad0d496f47acb034fe37b925eec02d", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
