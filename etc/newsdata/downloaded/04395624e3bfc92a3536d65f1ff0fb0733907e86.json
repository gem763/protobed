I won\u2019t say it ever happened to me, but it did. When you get used to one system and then you\u2019re all of a sudden on the other system where you\u2019re driving, it happens. You have to be careful.\u201d\n\nHuffPost Harry Dunn with his mother in an undated photo provided by the family.\n\nSome British politicians have joined the chorus of British citizens demanding Sacoolas be brought back to the U.K. for police questioning.\n\nTrump ventured that \u201cfrankly a lot of Americans feel the same way\u201d about the situation and want to help the Dunn family heal. He did not address the status of Sacoolas\u2019 diplomatic immunity.\n\nWhen British police spoke with Sacoolas after the collision, she told them she had no plans to leave the country, the authorities said. Police attempted to proceed with their investigation through the proper channels by applying for a diplomatic immunity waiver with the U.S. Embassy, which would allow them to question their suspect. The embassy, however, immediately relocated the Sacoolas family to the U.S. and denied the waiver request.\n\nPer the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats and their close family members are not subject to the foreign laws, and the U.S. State Department said it rarely waives the privilege in cases like this.\n\nAlthough there was some confusion this week over whether Sacoolas qualifies for diplomatic immunity, HuffPost confirmed her status with the U.K.\u2019s Foreign Office.\n\nIn a statement this week, the family said Dunn\u2019s mother would like to meet Sacoolas and \u201cgive her a hug.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe made a mistake that night,\u201d the family said of Sacoolas. \u201cWe all make mistakes.\u201d", "description": "The president appeared to say he has also driven on the wrong side of the road in a foreign country.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9e532c2100005009acc211.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
