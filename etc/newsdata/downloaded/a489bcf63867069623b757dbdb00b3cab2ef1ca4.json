While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,\u201d the letter from top aides Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield reads.\n\n\u201cWe write to demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative,\u201d the letter continues.\n\nThe Biden campaign letter goes on to note that \u201cGiuliani is not a public official, and holds no public office that would entitle him to opine on the nation\u2019s airwaves.\u201d And it demands that if the former mayor is put on the airwaves, \u201can equivalent amount of time\u201d be given \u201cto a surrogate for the Biden campaign.\u201d\n\nIn a text response to The Daily Beast, Giuliani said the Biden letter \u201csounds like the usual left wing censorship. Everything I say is supported by such as today, affidavits and statements. They are the ones who have covered up pay for play for at least 5 years.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale quipped, \u201cCan we request the removal of Democrats on TV that push hoaxes? Wait, but then who would do the interviews?\u201d\n\nPolitical campaigns have complained about bookings since the advent of politically-oriented television news. But rarely, if ever, has one campaign made an affirmative demand that a top aide to a rival candidate no longer be given a platform.\n\nTrump-Supporting Lawyers diGenova and Toensing Teamed Up With Giuliani to Dig Up Ukraine Dirt on Biden: Report\n\nBut Giuliani has pushed the bounds in ways few guests have before. The former New York City mayor and presidential candidate has been a repeat guest in recent days on numerous networks, during which he has peddled debunked-arguments about Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine and Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to remove a prosecutor in that country. During the course of those appearances, Giuliani has ignored that the prosecutor was facing pressure from much of the global community to resign and that the case against Hunter Biden\u2014who was serving on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma\u2014was dormant during the time Joe Biden demanded that the prosecutor step down.\n\nFrom there, Giuliani\u2019s appearances have delved into the conspiratorial, so much so that Trump\u2019s former top homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, admonished him during his own news hit on Sunday.\n\nAccording to a Biden campaign source, the letter was sent to all of the major network heads including NBC President Noah Oppenheim, CBS News President Susan Zirinsky and CNN President Jeff Zucker, along with hosts like CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd and Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace.\n\nWhile some Democrats have reveled in Giuliani\u2019s news tour, noting that he has managed to implicate several top State Department officials in his scheme to pressure Ukraine leadership to dig up dirt on Hunter Biden, the Biden campaign clearly does not share that schadenfreude.\n\nPompeo Grapples for Ways to Outlast Hurricane Rudy\n\n\u201cYour obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues,\u201d their letter reads. \u201cRudy Giuliani has made very clear that his only obligation is to protect Donald Trump, and that he will willingly lie to do so. While you have been aggressive in pushing back on him in real time, it is well known that the dedicated liar always has the advantage, pushing out outlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
