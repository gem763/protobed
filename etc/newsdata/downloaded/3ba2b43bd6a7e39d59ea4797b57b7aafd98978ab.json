The cannabis-derived ingredient has become a staple of self-care and beauty routines and is being used to address a wide range of issues, including pain (even that specific pain that comes from wearing high heels for hours on end!), poor sleep and low sex drives.\n\nThe new line, MOOD, is the most affordable collection of CBD goods we\u2019ve seen so far. Prices range from $8 to $20, and products contain anywhere from 25 to 150 milligrams of CBD oil \u2014 with the exception of zZz Pillow Mist, which doesn\u2019t contain any CBD.\n\nAmerican Eagle American's Eagle's first CBD brand, MOOD.\n\nMOOD has 45 different CBD bath and body products for men and women \u2014 body lotions, hand creams, face oils, muscle balms, lip salves, bath bombs, sugar scrubs, foaming face washes, aromatherapy oils and pillow mists \u2014 in six fragrances (that aren\u2019t sold with the gendered marketing you might see from other personal care brands). \u201cChill\u201d is a comforting warm vanilla fragrance, while \u201cEnergized\u201d is a mandarin nectar for when you\u2019re tired. \u201cFocused\u201d has a citrus twist, and \u201cRefreshed\u201d is a cooling coconut scent. Anxious folks might prefer \u201cSoothed,\u201d a calming eucalyptus, or \u201czZz,\u201d a relaxing lavender scent.\n\nSome research suggests that CBD (short for cannabidiol, a chemical compound from the cannabis plant) may help in some cases of generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder; other research suggests CBD has pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory benefits. However, the industry still isn\u2019t regulated, so there\u2019s still a lot TBD on the pros and cons of CBD.", "description": "Everything from the MOOD brand costs less than $20.", "authors": ["Commerce Specialist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d94df332100003c02f989e3.png?ops=1778_1000"}
