That I\u2019d always miscarry.\u2019\n\nAndrea, who is mother to Jean, seven, and Brett Jr, five, details the painful time in her new memoir Barefoot Pilgrimage which she insisted is not a 'pop star's autobiography'.\n\nAndrea is one fourth of Irish band The Corrs with her older siblings Jim, 55, Sharon, 49 and Caroline, 46, and has sold more than 40million records worldwide.\n\nKnown for global hits like Breathless and Runaway, Andrea insisted the band never let fame go to their heads during their heyday in the 1990s.\n\nAdmission: The singer told You magazine she was eager to become a mother after the couple married and experienced 'a lot of suffering in silence' (pictured with Brett in 2009)\n\n'The Corrs are an ordinary family that extraordinary things happened to,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Music just happened to be the thing we did and when we were in the middle of it none of it seemed strange, though obviously it was.\n\n'It\u2019s hard to be showbizzy when you\u2019re working with family. There\u2019s no opportunity to kick off, or get ideas above your station; you\u2019re all far too intimate with each other to try it on.'\n\nThe band, who went on hiatus in 2006 to pursue solo projects and concentrate on their personal lives, came back onto the music scene in 2015 with their record White Light and spoke of their love of touring again.\n\nShe said: 'Every time I\u2019d feel so sad for a life that wasn\u2019t there any more and also really frightened that this was it. That I\u2019d always miscarry' (pictured in September 2015)\n\nIn 2016, sister Sharon Corr shared the 'extra special feeling' to be back on tour with her brother and sisters while speaking to MailOnline at the Isle of Wight Festival.\n\nShe said: 'Being on the road is rocking, I love it.'\n\nThe siblings welcomed eight children between them during their decade long break, revealing that family life had also helped them grow as musicians.\n\n'I think we\u2019ve all grown musically,' she said of the break in the band's career, adding: 'And, in the meantime we\u2019ve had eight children between us, so that\u2019s taken up a lot of time of the road.'\n\nThe Corrs most recent album Jupiter Calling was released in November 2017 with the band promoting the record with a show at the Royal Albert Hall.", "description": "The singer, 45, told the Daily Mail's You magazine she was eager to become a mother after the couple tied the knot and experienced 'a lot of suffering in silence'.", "authors": ["Sean O'Grady For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658592-0-image-a-88_1570979854926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
