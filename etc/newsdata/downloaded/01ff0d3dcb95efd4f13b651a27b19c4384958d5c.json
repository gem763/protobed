These spots aren\u2019t to be confused with razor burn, which Lara Kaiser, an aesthetician at Brooklyn\u2019s Shen Beauty, says are two different things. \u201cRazor burn is caused by friction against the skin when the skin is not prepped well enough or the person shaved too aggressively,\u201d she says. Razor bumps are basically ingrown hairs, which can pop up anywhere that you remove hair and often happen on more delicate areas where the hair is coarse, like the bikini line. And they can happen to anyone, no matter how you remove the hair: \u201cRazor bumps are very common and can happen no matter what your landscaping method is and how thorough it is,\u201d assures Ania Siemieniaka, the manager and owner of Freckle, a spa in Greenpoint.\n\nLuckily, there are lots of products out there that you can use before and after waxing and shaving to help prevent or eliminate irritation \u2014 including some products that you might have assumed were only for the face but are more versatile than we thought. We talked to six aestheticians and waxing experts to hear which creams, gels, and serums to reach for in the days after waxing or shaving, and other steps you can take to stave off razor bumps in the first place.\n\nBest overall product for preventing razor bumps\n\nFur Skincare Fur Oil $39 (was $44, now 11% off) Three of the waxing specialists named this culty product as the best for combating razor bumps. The oil, which is specifically formulated to be safe for the pubic area, blends several soothing antiseptic and antimicrobial ingredients, like grapeseed, jojoba, and tea-tree oil, which will help keep the area clean and smooth. \u201cA great way to prevent razor burn is by keeping the skin around the bikini line really healthy, like with Fur Oil,\u201d says Kaiser. \u201cThis is an oil you apply for a few days before or after hair removal that is antiseptic and helps soften hair and hair regrowth. As far as I know, it\u2019s about the only product on the market specifically for pubic hair.\u201d Samantha Garlow, waxing specialist at Daphne, agrees. She says that while Fur Oil does carry a specific spot treatment for ingrowns, the original Fur Oil \u201ccan be used daily on clean, exfoliated skin, and is safe for your most sensitive areas.\u201d Audra Senkus, co-owner of Haven Spa, recommended the oil as well, telling us, \u201cWe love Fur Oil.\u201d She also pointed to the brand\u2019s stubble cream as a useful product to keep in the medicine cabinet. The stubble cream \u201csmooths the skin after waxing, and it also softens any prickly stubble,\u201d she says, noting that it also \u201cprevents ingrowns and bumps.\u201d $39 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest physical exfoliation products for preventing razor bumps\n\nAsian Exfoliating Bath Washcloth \u2014 Red & Green All of the aestheticians we spoke to said that exfoliating a few days after waxing or shaving is an important step in preventing bumps as hair starts to grow in. There are many ways to exfoliate \u2014 manually with a scrubbing mitt or cleansing scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant \u2014 and choosing one comes down to personal preference. Kaiser suggests using a \u201cscrubby mitt\u201d or dry brush. \u201cThat leaves less of a chance for the hairs to curl in on themselves, and exfoliates the area so there is nothing to clog pores, making them vulnerable to bacteria and inflammation,\u201d she says. \u201cThe scrubby mitt or dry brush can be from anywhere, they\u2019re all about the same.\u201d $4 at Amazon Buy $4 at Amazon Buy\n\nDr. Hauschka Cleansing Cream For those who want to exfoliate with a cleanser (or want to combine one with their scrubbing mitt), Mihoko Ninomiya, skin-care manager at Great Jones Spa, suggests using a gentle facial scrub. She likes Dr. Hauschka\u2019s Cleansing Cream, which has a \u201cgrittiness close to that of a \u201crice flour or an almond meal or powder,\u201d the ideal texture for a scrub for more delicate areas, according to Ninomiya. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nCrystal Peel Microdermabrasion Exfoliating Soap Body Bar And for those who prefer bar soap, Stalina Glot, senior aesthetician at Haven, recommends Crystal Peel Microdermabrasion Exfoliating Soap Body Bar. She says you can use it in the days leading up to shaving, but to \u201cavoid doing that the same day as shaving.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nCure Natural Aqua Gel Unlike the other physical exfoliants on this list, Cure Aqua Gel is made with 91 percent hydrogen water, which Winnie Zhong at oo35mm says works on the surface to remove dead skin. She says it can be used on the face and more sensitive parts of the body. \u201cYou would use this after cleansing steps or on dry skin; rub the gel into the skin and it reacts to dead skin,\u201d Zhong told us. $38 at Amazon Buy $40 at oo35mm Buy\n\nBest chemical exfoliation products for preventing razor bumps\n\nAlpha Skin Care Renewal Body Lotion Zhong also recommends Alpha Skin Care\u2019s Renewal Body Lotion, which she calls \u201ca cult favorite.\u201d The lotion has 12 perecent glycolic acid, which makes it ideal for improving skin texture. \u201cMany of our customers use it on keratosis pilaris and stubborn bumps,\u201d Zhong says. \u201cIt can also be good for acne scars.\u201d (We imagine it would be good for fading any scars left from past ingrowns as well.) $17 at Amazon Buy $17 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nBiologique Recherche Lotion P50 Speaking of cult exfoliants, you\u2019ve probably heard of Biologique Recherche\u2019s Lotion P50, a favorite facial toner of celebrities, beauty editors, and your skin-care-obsessed friend. The exfoliating toner can be used for more than your face, though, according to Garlow. \u201cP50 has a smart blend of proven clarifying ingredients like lactic acid, gluconolactone, salicylic acid, and sulfur, which moisturize, regulate oil, and prevent ingrown hairs,\u201d she says. Depending on sensitivity, you can dilute P50 with water. \u201cIt\u2019s best used out of the shower by pressing, not rubbing,\u201d Garlow told us. \u201cIt\u2019s recommended to use once a day and 24 hours after hair removal, and you can follow it with Fur Oil.\u201d $30 at Shop Rescue Spa Buy\n\nBest hair-removal-specific skin cleansers\n\nRosebud Woman Refresh: Cleansing Spray Ninomiya recommends Rosebud Woman\u2019s Refresh Cleansing Spray as a pre- and post-waxing-and-shaving cleanser rather than harsh, alcohol-based wipes. \u201cAs the name suggests, there are refreshing ingredients such as aloe and lavender, and helpful antiseptic and anti-inflammatory naturals such as tea-tree oil and witch hazel,\u201d she says. To use the spray, you just have to spritz some on, pat it in, and let it dry \u2014 no need to rinse off after using. $40 at Rosebud Woman Buy\n\nSkyn Iceland Nordic Skin Peel Another alternative to harsh wipes are Skyn Iceland\u2019s Nordic Skin Peel pads, which Siemieniaka says were designed for acneic skin but \u201cwork wonders on your bikini bumps.\u201d She told us that she learned about the pads \u2014 the perfect application format for when you\u2019re feeling a bit lazy or busy \u2014 from Katie Jane Hughes, a British makeup artist. \u201cI got hooked, and after a while, I realized that it works really well on the bikini area, especially those sensitive types,\u201d says Siemieniaka, who also notes that they won\u2019t dry out your skin. $45 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest gels for preventing razor bumps\n\nPFB Vanish Siemieniaka also told us about PFB Vanish, which can be used with not-so-sensitive skin. \u201cIts powerful combo of glycolic, salicylic, and lactic acids will reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and exfoliate the skin (yes, ingrown-hair prevention right there),\u201d she says. \u201cOur clients love it.\u201d It comes in a roll-on bottle, which makes it easy to apply. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Amazon Buy\n\nAlchimie Forever Antioxidant Skin Repair Gel Ninomiya says that this gel is designed to help prevent razor burn on the face, but that it\u2019s also effective for ingrowns anywhere else on the body. It\u2019s full of natural antioxidants like green tea and anti-inflammatory ingredients rosemary and turmeric, making it a useful product for keeping skin healthy overall. $55 at Amazon Buy $55 at Dermstore Buy\n\nUltraluxe Women's Ingrown Hair & Razor Bump Treatment If you\u2019d rather use a formula specifically designed for women, Senkus suggests UltraLuxe\u2019s Women\u2019s Ingrown Hair treatment, which she says can be used on the face and body to stave off ingrown hairs. \u201cThe technology actually cools and calms your skin post-shaving, preventing the chance of irritation before it begins.\u201d The cooling factor comes from the ingredient allantoin, which is known for its anti-redness, anti-irritation properties. $23 at Amazon Buy $23 at Dermstore Buy\n\nPrincereigns Ingrown Hair Eliminating Serum This one is a favorite of both Glot and Senkus. Glot suggests using it twice a day and notes that \u201cserums are designed with low molecules that penetrate to the hair follicle and remove dead skin cells, pushing the hair up.\u201d Senkus told us that Princereigns also \u201cremoves dark spots and soften and straightens curly hair while removing ingrown hairs and razor bumps.\u201d $30 at Princereigns Buy\n\nBest natural treatment for preventing razor bumps\n\nRadha Beauty Tea Tree Essential Oil, 4-Ounces \u201cFor natural-remedy lovers, I recommend tea-tree-oil compress,\u201d says Siemieniaka. \u201cTea-tree oil is extremely rich in antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that will help you get rid of redness and itchiness caused by razor bumps.\u201d She cautions against using tea-tree oil in its pure form and suggests mixing a couple of drops of oil with a few tablespoons of warm water instead. \u201cThen make a compress with a cotton ball and apply onto affected areas for about ten minutes. For best results, I would do this twice a day,\u201d she says. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
