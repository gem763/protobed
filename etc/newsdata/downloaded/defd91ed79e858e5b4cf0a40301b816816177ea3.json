This Euro 2020 qualifier has to be a watershed moment, a seminal moment when this \u201cabhorrent racist abuse\u201d as the Football Association immediately and unequivocally called it in their statement demanding a Uefa investigation has to stop.\n\nEngland acted with utter dignity and professionalism throughout, with the game stopped twice in the first-half because of the abuse, and sent out a message to the world beyond the emphatic score-line of England 6 Racists 0.\n\nThey could have walked off unilaterally \u2013 and no-one would surely have disagreed if they did - but instead they steadfastly followed the Uefa protocols, they reported what they heard and they made their point with their football and their impeccable behaviour. Croatian referee Ivan Bebek did give England the option of leaving the pitch for 10 minutes after the second incident on 43 minutes but, because it was so close to half-time, Gareth Southgate said he would wait until then and speak to his players in the dressing room. After what had happened in Montenegro \u2013 when Sterling and Danny Rose were abused - they must have been sorely tempted to take their own action.\n\n\u201cI know whatever we do might be perceived as not being enough but we have made a major statement,\u201d Southgate rightly said. No-one could dispute that and the England manager was as dignified as ever even if, at times, he looked like he had had enough.\n\nBut the players wanted to continue. They wanted to finish it, win the game and not let the racists triumph and they did that emphatically. There were six goals. There could have been 10. In the back of their minds there will have been a desire to bounce back from the disappointing defeat against the Czech Republic and their powers of concentration were remarkable.", "description": "England left Bulgaria with three points, six goals and surely one line finally drawn in the sand.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Alan Tyers", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Live Updates", "Sam Wallace", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/14/TELEMMGLPICT000213033856-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUayTBgXyxOzV0bR3yr2q7sbg.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
