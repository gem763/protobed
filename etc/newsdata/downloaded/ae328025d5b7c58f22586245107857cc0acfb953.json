Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS\n\nMoscow\u2019s warning came shortly before Russian and Syrian security forces were due to start overseeing the removal of YPG fighters and weapons at least 30 km (19 miles) into Syria, under the deal struck by presidents Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nA complete pullout of the YPG would mark a victory for Erdogan, who launched a cross-border offensive on Oct. 9 to drive the Kurdish militia from the border and create a \u201csafe zone\u201d for the return of Syrian refugees.\n\nThe accord, which expands on a U.S.-brokered deal last week, also underlines Putin\u2019s dominant influence in Syria and seals the return of his ally President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces to northeast Syria for the first time in years, by endorsing the deployment of Syrian border guards from noon (0900 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nSix days later, Russian and Turkish forces will jointly start to patrol a 10 km strip of land in northeast Syria where U.S. troops for years were deployed along with their former Kurdish allies.\n\nThose changes reflect the dizzying pace of changes in Syria since President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria earlier this month, shaking up the military balance across a quarter of the country after eight years of conflict and prolonged freezes on the frontlines.\n\nKurdish militia commanders have yet to respond to the deal reached in Russia\u2019s Black Sea resort of Sochi, and it was not immediately clear how their withdrawal could be enforced.\n\nRUSSIAN WARNING\n\nA joint Turkish-Russian statement issued after six hours of talks between Putin and Erdogan said they would establish a \u201cjoint monitoring and verification mechanism\u201d to oversee implementation of the agreement.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was more blunt. If Kurdish forces did not retreat, Syrian border guards and Russian military police would have to fall back. \u201cAnd remaining Kurdish formations would then fall under the weight of the Turkish army,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a swipe at Washington, which has called into question how the deal will be guaranteed, Peskov said the United States had been the closest ally of the Kurdish fighters but had now betrayed them.\n\n\u201cNow they (the Americans) prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks,\u201d he said in remarks to Russian news agencies.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF were Washington\u2019s main allies in the fight to dismantle Islamic State\u2019s self-declared caliphate in Syria. Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out was criticized by U.S. lawmakers, including fellow Republicans, as a betrayal.\n\nIn a further sign of growing ties between Ankara and Moscow, which have alarmed the U.S. administration, the head of Russia\u2019s defense sales agency was quoted by the Interfax news agency on Wednesday as saying Moscow could deliver more S-400 missile defense systems to Turkey.\n\nTurkish soldiers on an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) drive near the Turkish-Syrian border in Ceylanpinar, Turkey, October 22, 2019.
