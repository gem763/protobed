Everyone thinks \u00adLottie has got off the hook.'\n\nFury: Apprentice candidates are reportedly outraged that Lottie Lion has been 'let off with a slap on the wrist' after telling rival Lubna Farhan to 'Shut up Gandhi'\n\nThey insisted: 'The comments are totally out of order and racist. Yet she has been let off with a slap on the wrist.\n\n'There is a general feeling among those on the show the BBC don\u2019t understand how offended people are \u2014 or just want it to go away.\n\nMailOnline have contacted The Apprentice for comment.\n\nThe BBC told Ms Lion, a 19-year-old candidate on its show, that telling rival Ms Farhan 'shut up Gandhi' was 'wholly unacceptable'.\n\nUnimpressed: It is believed that at least four of the contestants complained about the remark which was allegedly made in the group's WhatsApp chat to Ms Farhan (pictured), according to The Sun\n\nProducers reported the comments, which were made after filming for the programme finished, to the broadcaster while investigating the incident.\n\nThe website's source claimed that people may have been able to forgive her if she had admitted fault and apologised for the comment.\n\nThe show's producers told the Sun that the appropriate course was being taken and it is being dealt with between them and the individual concerned.\n\nMs Lion has previously said that the comment was 'taken out of context' but the corporation issued a statement condemning her remarks on Friday.\n\n'Unacceptable': The BBC told Ms Lion, a 19-year-old candidate on its show, that telling rival Ms Farhan 'shut up Gandhi' was 'wholly unacceptable' (pictured: Lottie, Jemelin, Lubna and Carina [left to right] have a disagreement on task in South Africa)\n\n'While this happened on a private messenger service once filming had concluded, the BBC nevertheless still expects the candidates to behave appropriately,' the BBC said.\n\n'The production company have looked into the issue and reported back, Lottie has been informed that her comments were wholly unacceptable and is in no doubt about our view on this.'\n\nMailOnline asked the BBC if any further action will be taken against Ms Lion, who is still appearing on the pre-recorded show.\n\nMahatma Gandhi led the fight for India's independence from the British Empire in 1947 and was famed for his peaceful brand of resistance.\n\nIt comes after The Sun reported that Ms Lion's fellow contestants want her axed from future appearances and the You're Fired sister show.\n\nAs well as the messages sent on the group chat, it has also been claimed that Lottie made racist and homophobic comments during filming.\n\nShe is said to have referred to Ryan-Mark Parsons as the 'short gay one', while calling Riyonn Farsad 'the tall gay one'.\n\nMs Lions was also accused of making derogatory comments towards transgender woman.\n\nDenial: Lottie (pictured above) has denied that she is racist, transphobic or homophobic following the claims but a source said that contestants want her axed from future appearances\n\nTensions reached boiling point at the candidate house during filming, and one is said to have threatened to quit the show following 'racist' comments made by Lottie.\n\nFilming of the show took place between April and June in north London and a show source last night reportedly told the Sun that contestants were told to 'let it go'.\n\n'It was not taken seriously and basically swept under the carpet. But Lottie's behaviour was outrageous.\n\n'She also made the homophobic comments, which were totally unnecessary. Contestants complained to producers in the house and asked them to look into it.'\n\nOutrage: Contestants are said to have threatened to quit the show because of Lottie's comments. She is pictured above during filming with Lubna\n\nThe source stated that producers would only leave when candidates had gone to bed and were aware of the comments being made.\n\nThey added: 'The racism issue is a big one and it is going to blow up in the show and the BBC's face. It is not going to go away and people are shocked with how it's been handled.'\n\nLottie is said to have rebuked the claims and said they were 'untrue'. But fellow candidate Souleyman Bah claimed 'of course it's true'.\n\nBefore filming starts on the show, contestants are made to sign a form which acknowledges that they will be kicked out for bad behaviour.", "description": "Apprentice candidates are reportedly outraged that Lottie Lion has been 'let off with a slap on the wrist' after telling rival Lubna Farhan to 'Shut up Gandhi'.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean", "Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/00/20306292-0-image-a-10_1572310242793.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
