She told her family she planned to start competing in bodybuilding after giving birth \u2013 they just laughed, which only made her more determined.\n\nCourtney, who shares her fitness journey on Instagram, said: \u2018I think anyone feels less confident after having a baby. Our bodies went through something amazing, but we will never look the same again.\n\n\u2018For me, I was so happy to have my healthy babies, that my body didn\u2019t bother me as much as how weak I felt did. I wasn\u2019t able to work out during my pregnancy, so going back to the gym postpartum was like starting from scratch.\n\nCourtney found it difficult feeling \u2018weak\u2019 during pregnancy (Picture: MDWfeatures / @court_vital_fit)\n\n\u2018I remember about halfway through my pregnancy, my mum asked me if I was upset about losing my fit body, she had twins and swore it was the reason she never got her body back.\n\n\u2018I told her and the rest of my family that I planned to compete in bodybuilding after having my babies and they all laughed in my face \u2013 pretty uncontrollably actually. I was livid, but so determined to show them I could.\n\n\u2018I guess I have a rebellious attitude because I love proving people wrong \u2013 especially when it involves bettering myself. That\u2019s a win-win.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust nine months after the arrival of her twins, Courtney competed in a bikini competition and came sixth.\n\nCourtney after giving birth to Elijah (left) and now (right) Picture: MDWfeatures / @court_vital_fit)\n\nGetting up on that stage was a massive boost to Courtney\u2019s confidence, reminding her that she can do anything she sets her mind to.\n\n16 months after giving birth to her third child Elijah in February, she competed in another bodybuilding competition, this time placing third and fourth.\n\nShe wants to show that after her pregnancy she\u2019s the fittest and strongest she\u2019s ever been, and has embraced every part of her body.\n\nShe may be super toned but she still has loose skin on her stomach. Courtney refuses to be ashamed of this and shows it off every time she goes on stage.\n\nCourtney is proud of her loose skin Picture: MDWfeatures / @court_vital_fit)\n\nThe mum-of-three said: \u2018I love and respect my body now more than ever. I\u2019ve never been as strong, both mentally and physically as I am now after having three babies.\n\n\u2018I have loose skin, but that doesn\u2019t take away from any of my accomplishments. I went on stage with that same loose skin and walked away with hardware.\n\n\u2018I do have moments of self-doubt, but I snap myself out of it because I\u2019m so blessed to have my babies and I\u2019m not going to let skin and scars shake my vibe.\n\nCaption: FORT MILL, SOUTH CAROLINA, USA: Courtney ready for a bikini contest in July 2019 (Picture: MDWfeatures / @court_vital_fit)\n\n\u2018I received so much love from friends and strangers letting me know how much I inspired them to get healthy \u2013 which is all I\u2019ve ever wanted. If I can help someone turn their life around, it will ripple and affect many more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t lie, at first I was nervous about receiving backlash and negativity\u2026 things like I should be home with my kids and stop being selfish or self-centred, but I didn\u2019t hear any of that.\u2019\n\nWhen Courtney is prepping for a competition, she cuts out sugar, sweets, soda, restaurant meals, alcohol and lattes in favour of tuna, chicken, nuts, vegetables, rice cakes, peanut butter and egg whites.\n\nShe wants to show others that it\u2019s possible to lead a healthy lifestyle and chase down your goals as a busy parent.\n\nCourtney with Mason (Picture: MDWfeatures / @court_vital_fit)\n\nTo any other mums hoping to get into fitness, Courtney says: \u2018I want to show women it is possible and that it can be done no matter what one\u2019s circumstances may be. Working out at home, during lunch, during nap time, or just making better choices about what we put into our bodies. We are the most important person in our children\u2019s lives and they deserve healthy mums.\n\n\u2018Start slow, don\u2019t feel guilty, and hire a trainer. Just because you were a varsity athlete in high school doesn\u2019t mean you can jump back in the game and hit 20 burpees at a jump.\n\n\u2018Your body just did an amazing thing- it made a human that you brought into the world. Ease back into your routine to avoid injury, which leads me to getting a trainer. A good trainer is an investment in your health and wellbeing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If you want to get back in shape, build your programme with a pro who will guide you and help you avoid injury. Lastly, don\u2019t feel bad about it.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re the most important person in your child\u2019s life. They want you to be healthy and happy. Take 30-60 minutes a day to do something for yourself so you can be your best self.\u2019\n\nMORE: The hottest fitness trends for 2020\n\nMORE: Mum mortified as naked toddler goes down slide, covering everything in poo\n\nMORE: Mum shares genius trick to get a moment of peace and quiet from the kids\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Courtney Standridge wants to prove that the changes the body goes through during pregnancy don't have to hold you back.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_88188339_1570175771.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
