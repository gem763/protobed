Extensive changes must be made before the bill could be supported.\"\n\nThe suggested changes would prevent the minister, employers or even union members from seeking to deregister a union or disqualify a union official and restrict applications solely to the Registered Organisations Commission.\n\nThe senators also want to stop disqualifications or deregistrations on trivial or technical grounds and insist a different approach \"must be adopted\".\n\nThey suggest a demerit points system where minor breaches are penalised but don't give rise to cancellation.\n\nSignificant or repeated minor breaches could warrant cancellation but \"like a drivers licence scheme, the passage of time should see a drop-off of accumulated demerit points\".\n\n\"If a similar scheme is incorporated, an application to the court under this bill should only be possible once a particular demerit threshold is reached.\"\n\nJudges should also be required to consider the gravity of an offence in deciding whether to make adverse orders against a union or official.\n\nCurrently, the bill requires the court to be satisfied that deregistration or disqualification is not \"unjust\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe senators said they also \"remain unconvinced\" new restrictions on union mergers, including the introduction of a public interest test, are necessary given the disqualification and deregistration provisions already target serious misconduct.\n\n\"It is Centre Alliance\u2019s strong view that law-abiding organisations should be allowed to amalgamate without interference.\"\n\nThe government is understood to have already agreed to changes in negotiations with the Centre Alliance Senator Rex Patrick, leaving it needing the support of either One Nation or Jacqui Lambie.\n\nSenator Lambie has said she remains determined to vote for the bill while John Setka remains at the helm of the Victorian division of the CFMEU.", "description": "Crossbenchers want extensive changes in return for their support of the government's bill to cancel rogue unions and officials.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4827%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_360%2C$y_19/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5fc49a3aede78c1290aa73fa259d09596a81b3c2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
