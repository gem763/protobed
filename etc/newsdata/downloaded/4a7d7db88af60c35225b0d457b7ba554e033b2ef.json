Jay Gruden surprised the football world Sunday by making Peterson a healthy scratch.\n\nWhy was the case? It all had to do with special teams, according to Gruden.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJay Gruden on the Peterson decision: pic.twitter.com/11fe4TwyhG \u2014 John Keim (@john_keim) September 8, 2019\n\nGruden cited playing against Darren Sproles as the reason for making Peterson inactive. Gruden explained the team needed players who could cover Sproles on punts. That\u2019s why Peterson sat.\n\nPeterson said he wasn\u2019t sure how to handle the scratch.\n\nStrange day for Adrian Peterson, first healthy scratch of his career. #redskins pic.twitter.com/mgUDiKGiYz \u2014 Kareem Copeland (@kareemcopeland) September 8, 2019\n\nWhile Gruden made it sound like Peterson\u2019s benching was just a one-game thing, that may not be the case. Gruden indicated Peterson\u2019s playing time could be game-dependent.\n\n\"So if we have a game where we think we can run the ball 55 times in a game in an I-formation, then sure, I\u2019ll get him up.\u201d \u2014 Barry Svrluga (@barrysvrluga) September 8, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, Derrius Guice is the team\u2019s primary starter. Washington will only use Peterson and Guice together if the team believes it can run the ball a ton during a contest. Gruden specifically cited \u201c55 times in a game,\u201d which would be unheard of in today\u2019s era.\n\nThat puts the 34-year-old Peterson in a tough spot moving forward. Barring an injury to Guice, Peterson isn\u2019t going to see the field much. If Washington intends to operate the same way moving forward, a trade might be best for both sides.\n\n(Yahoo Sports NFL H/N: NFL.com)\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
