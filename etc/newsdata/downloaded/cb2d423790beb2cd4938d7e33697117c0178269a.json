The villain uses holographic techniques and projector drones to create a sequence of horrifying illusions.\n\nAlthough the movie\u2019s VFX was completed by a combination of companies, Framestore was responsible for this thrilling section. To make a sequence like this, the shots must go through different stages, with 120 employees all working in unison: Modelling, texture, shading, rigging, animation, rendering and lighting the shot.\n\nTo begin, the Framestore art department worked on creative references with director Jon Watts and VFX Supervisor Janek Sirrs. Visual references included the comic books, surrealist paintings, and other Hollywood movies such as \u201cThe Matrix\u201d and \u201cSpectre.\u201d\n\nThe transitions from one scene to another were particularly difficult. They used an FX-driven transition dubbed the \u2018B.A.R.F\u2019 effect, which is based on the transition used by Iron Man in a scene from \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201d\n\nFX such as Mysterio\u2019s blast, or the smoke inside his helmet, were created by other vendors. Framestore create the FX of green smoke and applied it to different environments. The texture of the smoke can be dry ice, wispy, or thick like a floor.\n\nThe sequence involved three main Spider-man suits. The Home-Made suit, as seen in \u201cSpider-man: Homecoming,\u201d the Stealth suit, and the Homecoming suit. At one stage, we see Spidey in a \u2018Shard room\u2019, where he looks at multiple versions of himself, all moving independently. For this, the team had to create 20 individual animated Spider-man suits.\n\nThey also had to design the character suit for a zombified Iron Man.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
