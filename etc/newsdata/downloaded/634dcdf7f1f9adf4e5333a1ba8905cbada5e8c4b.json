Then we\u2019ll make decisions, that\u2019s how it is. Nothing is fixed.\n\n\u201cThe players on international duty all came back healthy, which is very, very important, so we now had three or four days with the full squad to prepare it, which is a little bit comfortable at least.\u201d\n\nPredicted Liverpool line-up vs Man Utd: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Matip, van Dijk, Robertson,Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Mane, Firmino, Salah", "description": "The Reds are bidding to maintain their perfect start to the Premier League season with a ninth consecutive win", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Liverpool Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20585909.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Liverpool-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
