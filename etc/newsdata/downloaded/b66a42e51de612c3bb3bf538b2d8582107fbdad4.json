But that\u2019s what makes him the best in the business.

And that\u2019s what makes him great.\u201d\n\nGerrit Cole didn't have his best stuff but it was still enough to hold the New York Yankees scoreless over seven innings. (Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCole morphed from strikeout artist into escape artist in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series, stranding nine Yankees over seven shutout innings, and the Astros beat New York 4-1 to take a 2-1 series lead.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of his best qualities is when he doesn\u2019t have a pitch or he doesn\u2019t have command and he figures out how to get the job done,\u201d Astros third baseman Alex Bregman said. \u201cAnd we can all learn from that.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old righty improved to 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA in his last 25 starts, posting 258 strikeouts in 169 1/3 innings over that span. In the playoffs, he\u2019s 3-0 with a 0.40 ERA in three starts, posting 32 strikeouts in 22 1/3 innings over that span.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s the best pitcher in baseball right now,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHis competition is right next to him in the clubhouse [Justin Verlander]. They\u2019re certainly a good pair. I watch what [Stephen] Strasburg is doing, I see what [Max] Scherzer is doing, [Jacob] deGrom in this city. There\u2019s a lot of big names. But I\u2019m obviously biased to my guys.\n\n\u201cGerrit is locked in. And to see him do it on the big stage in a playoff game with the magnitude of this game, it was pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Cole walked to his postgame press conference in the bowels of the stadium, Verlander\u2019s wife, Kate Upton, waved to Cole and told him, \u201cgood game.\u201d\n\nIt sure was. A big-game pitcher stepping up on the biggest stage. His latest showcase heading into a winter of riches.\n\nBack up the money truck for Gerrit Cole\n\nCole is on the verge of being paid handsomely \u2014 a free-agent-to-be at season\u2019s end.\n\nThere will be no shortage of suitors for his services, basically any big-market team with big bucks to spend. And Cole may end up breaking David Price\u2019s record contract for a starter of seven years, $217 million\n\nThe California Kid could head back home to the Los Angeles Dodgers (after their latest playoff disappointment) or Angels. Or maybe he could come east to join the Philadelphia Phillies or Washington Nationals (if they lose Stephen Strasburg). Or maybe he could finally join his childhood favorite team, the Yankees.\n\nNew York selected Cole, who grew up a Yankees fan, in the first round of the 2008 MLB draft, but couldn\u2019t even get him to the negotiating table. Cole wanted to play college baseball for UCLA \u2014 and a reported $4 million signing bonus didn\u2019t make him change his mind.\n\nA decade later, the Yankees again tried to acquire him from the Pittsburgh Pirates. But the Bombers were unwilling to include emerging youngsters Gleyber Torres or Miguel Andujar in a trade package, instead insisting on Clint Frazier and Nick Solak as centerpieces of a potential deal.\n\nIt was understandable at the time, as Cole was coming off a down season in which he went 12-12 with a 4.26 ERA and 31 homers allowed. Yet the Astros were the beneficiaries, ultimately landing Cole in exchange for Joe Musgrove, Colin Moran, Michael Feliz and Jason Martin and then turning his career around.\n\nIn an era of juiced \u2014 or now maybe unjuiced \u2014 baseballs and openers, Cole is a rare commodity, a starter with the ability to go deep in games and face opposing lineups three or four times in a single night.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night, 48,998 fans went home unhappy because of him.\n\nPulling off a Houdini Act\n\nCole\u2019s fastball maxed out at 100.3 mph and he got 13 swinging strikes on 112 pitches. Five of his seven strikeouts came via his slider.\n\nBut he also gave up four hits and a staggering five walks, several times overcoming traffic on the basepaths. In the first, he stranded the bases loaded. In the second, third and fifth, he stranded a pair.\n\nYankees shortstop Didi Gregorius came closest to breaking through against Cole. With two on, two out and the Astros up 2-0 in the fifth, Gregorius lifted a long fly ball toward the short porch in right.\n\nAt first, Hinch thought it was gone.\n\n\u201cI think every fly ball in 2019 is a homer,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cRegular season, postseason, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s kind of been conditioned that way.\u201d\n\nBut then Hinch looked at Gregorius \u2014 and his initial fears were alleviated.\n\n\u201cI immediately watched the hitter. The hitter tells you most,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t respond right away with sort of the pure excitement. He kind of watched it for a minute and then I looked up and saw [Josh] Reddick getting back, settling underneath it. I watched Didi again, then I felt a little bit better.\u201d\n\nCole wasn\u2019t as concerned \u2014 at least upon contact, anyway.\n\n\u201cThen I turned around and realized where we were playing and so I got a little worried,\u201d he said. \u201cReddick kind of drifted back. He usually \u2014 when he\u2019s got a bead on it \u2014 it keeps my blood pressure down a little bit. But the emotions kind of followed the fly ball, right? So it was kind of like low to freaking out to not so worried anymore.\u201d\n\nGregorius struck Cole\u2019s 98.6-mph fastball with an exit velocity of 101.4 mph. It went 343 feet. But the expected batting average on the hit was .140, and the ball settled nicely into Reddick\u2019s glove right in front of the wall.\n\nJust like that, a potential crisis averted. The Yankees went 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position against Cole.\n\nAstros catcher Martin Maldonado also had a pair of long fly balls die for long outs.\n\nAsked if the regular-season ball is different from the postseason ball, Cole responded: \u201cI mean, I haven\u2019t really put much thought into it. I just try to respond to if it goes out or if it doesn\u2019t go out the best I can. I don\u2019t know if it was the ball or if it was the wind. It was a little chilly tonight. I\u2019m not quite sure exactly how this park plays. I\u2019ve only pitched here one other time.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s baseball. Did [Derek] Jeter\u2019s ball [in the 1996 ALCS] really go out or did the guy reach over and pull it out? Come on,\u201d Cole said with a laugh.\n\nTipping or not tipping\n\nThe Yankees don\u2019t love paying big money for pitchers.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka (seven years, $155 million) and CC Sabathia (seven years, $161 million) are their most recent massive expenditures in that department. And both have delivered in the postseason to help justify their deals.\n\nTanaka improved his career postseason ERA to 1.32 in Game 1, helping the Yankees take Game 1 in Houston.\n\nBut the two starters that have followed him \u2014 James Paxton and Luis Severino \u2014 combined for just 6 2/3 innings in Game 2 and 3.\n\nAnd there has been rampant speculation that both Paxton (2 1/3 IP, 1 ER) and Severino (4 1/3 IP, 2 ER) were tipping.\n\nSeverino required 62 pitches to get through the first two innings in Game 3. He ended up throwing 40 off-speed pitches on the evening, but got only two swinging strikes with them \u2014 both on George Springer strikeouts.\n\nMeanwhile, Jose Altuve (first inning) and Josh Reddick (second) blasted a pair of hanging sliders from Severino for solo homers, giving Cole some early run support.\n\nFormer player-turned-analyst Alex Rodriguez tweeted as much during Tuesday\u2019s game.\n\nSeverino update:\n\n\n\n62 Pitches\n\n8 Swings and Misses\n\n7 misses on fastballs\n\n\n\nAll because they know what's coming so they're starting early and can't stop. #postseason \u2014 Alex Rodriguez (@AROD) October 15, 2019\n\nAsked about A-Rod\u2019s tweet, Bregman \u2014 who struck out in the first despite fouling off six pitches in an 11-pitch at-bat \u2014 said: \u201cI wish I knew. He struck me out. But I mean, every time we get hits now I think everyone thinks somebody\u2019s tipping. We\u2019re just trying to compete and put together good at-bats, and I think the at-bats were better today.\u201d\n\nTold off the off-speed pitches stat, he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe we saw the ball well. I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t tell you. He punched me out on a fastball that exploded out of his hand. The rest of them looked very small as well. He was throwing pellets.\u201d\n\nWith Tanaka entering the final year of his deal in 2020 ($23 million), Sabathia retiring at season\u2019s end and the Yankees faced with the possibility that Domingo German could be suspended for a large portion of next year due to his domestic violence incident, there will be some decisions to make in the rotation.\n\nAnd if the Bombers don\u2019t win the World Series, it will mark 10 years since their last title in 2009.\n\nThey needed to win Game 3. They didn\u2019t. And now they\u2019re in trouble.\n\nAll of it could lead to a run at Gerrit Cole, who is going to make a killing regardless.\n\nIn the meantime, Bregman is just trying to figure out Tanaka.\n\n\u201cCan you have him help us?\u201d Bregman joked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s throwing, but I\u2019d like to know.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Gerrit Cole didn't have his best stuff on Tuesday night.
