Nato retaliates with a single tactical nuclear air strike.\n\n\u201cAs the nuclear threshold is crossed, fighting escalates to a tactical nuclear war in Europe. Russia sends 300 nuclear warheads via aircraft and short-range missiles to hit Nato bases and advancing troops. Nato responds with approximately 180 nuclear warheads via aircraft.\u201d\n\nAfter that, hundreds of further strikes are made on both sides against military nuclear forces. In the video, Russia\u2019s red streaks lift away from the ground moments before America\u2019s rain of blue obliterates swathes of the country; then, Moscow\u2019s bombs crash into the US from coast to coast.\n\nLater, Washington and Moscow would both target population centres, with up to 10 missiles per city from their remaining submarine arsenals.\n\nSGS claims the video is \u201cbased on real force postures, targets and fatality estimates\u201d. The first simulated nuclear blast appears to occur just inside Poland, near Wroclaw and the borders with Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Moscow also does not want a war with Nato, he said.\n\nMr Dudin added: \u201cFrom an operational perspective, it also seems that integrated air defence systems have disappeared from Europe. These systems would have a major impact on nuclear strikes launched from aircraft. The casualty estimates also seem to be low.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, several likely targets seem to have been missed out. Considering that France is a nuclear power, and British nuclear-armed submarines operate out of Faslane in Scotland, this seems like an oversight which demonstrates the American tendency to ignore allies.\n\n\u201cThe terminology is quite typical of how the US thinks about Nato. Whereas the UK would talk about a Nato operation, as opposed to a UK-Nato operation, the US typically views Nato as something separate from them.\u201d\n\nSGS\u2019 simulation comes as Princeton physicists launch a project to persuade fellow scientists of the need to reduce the threat posed by nuclear armaments.\n\nEarlier this year Vladimir Putin signed a bill suspending Russia\u2019s role in a key nuclear pact with the US, after Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the treaty.\n\nThe 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty banned the production, testing and deployment of land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 310 to 3,410 miles.\n\nWatch the full SGS simulation here.", "description": "More than 90 million people would be killed or injured in a nuclear war between the US and Russia if a conventional conflict went too far, according to a new simulation created by researchers.
