(And the area, once widely known as part of the Fertile Crescent, also has a rich history of agriculture.)\n\nWhile about two-thirds of Syria is classified as desert, it\u2019s more of a dusty semidesert than the stereotypical rolling-sand-dunes-style desert, according to experts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSyria is a dry country,\u201d said Syrian environmental journalist Muhammad Fares. \u201cIt has fertile areas in other ways.\u201d\n\nFares distinguished between Syria\u2019s dusty and dry semidesert (called badia in Arabic) with the sandy sahara (which means desert in Arabic) found in other Middle Eastern and North African countries, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been plenty of opportunity for successful agriculture [in Syria] over a long period of time,\u201d noted Colin Kelley of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) at Columbia University. \u201cEven though we know that the area is aridifying due to climate change, it\u2019s certainly not only desert.\u201d\n\nThe disputed Golan Heights \u2014 which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and the Trump administration controversially recognized as annexed Israeli territory in April \u2014 is particularly renowned for its lush, rolling green hills and apple and grape orchards.\n\nThere is one area where Trump could find his sand: western Syria, where there are two mountainous coastal cities, Latakia and Tartus, home to sandy beaches and nearby Russian military bases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoreover, northeastern Syria, which borders Turkey and was the direct target of Trump\u2019s latest comments, is in fact one of the least desertlike parts of Syria. This area is historically part of the Fertile Crescent, where scientists say agricultural and herding society began 12,000 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe real significance of the Kurdish-controlled northeast is that that\u2019s the traditionally wheat and cotton basket of Syria, as well as the part of the country that has a significant chunk of the oil,\u201d said Peter Schwartzstein, a journalist and fellow with the Center for Climate & Security.\n\nThere is a connection between Syria\u2019s climate and conflict, just not the Orientalist Arabs-fighting-in-sand image that Trump\u2019s word choice may conjure up, experts said.\n\nAD\n\nKelley was part of a team of scientists that published a report in 2015 analyzing how decades of Syrian agricultural policies forced an overuse of groundwater that led to a major drought in 2006. They argued that the drought then destabilized the country\u2019s economy and society, setting the stage for much of the dissatisfaction that drove people to the streets in 2011.\n\n\u201cPresident Bashar al-Assad\u2019s liberal economic policies increased destabilization by removing fuel and food subsidies that many rural families depend on for their livelihoods,\u201d the study concluded. \u201cThese policies continued despite the drought, making agricultural work unsustainable, thus inducing mass migration of rural families to cities.\u201d\n\nFares, the Syrian journalist, said he sometimes laughs when he hears Westerners describing Syria as just a country of sand and camels. But more often, \u201cit\u2019s really just sad,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to its human cost, the Syrian conflict, now in its eighth year, has worsened many of the country\u2019s already dire environmental issues, such as desertification and deforestation.\n\nFares said Trump\u2019s comments upset him most because it felt \u201cas if there are no people\u201d in Syria. He likened the mind-set to how the Syrian government, which has been accused of committing war crimes, sees Syria\u2019s people and environment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same way the Syrian regime looks at the country,\u201d he said, as just \u201cresources to exploit.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "There are all kinds of ways in which the president's disdainful \u201csand\u201d comments are mistaken.", "authors": ["Miriam Berger", "Reporter Covering Middle East", "Foreign Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uZmTjhAuFBXVXeB2YM8Htu9mAKM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DIBMIGW3ZII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
