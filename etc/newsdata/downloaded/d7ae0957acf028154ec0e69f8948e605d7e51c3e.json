(Reuters/Maxim Shemetov)\n\nBank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and other big banks are getting an earful from environmental groups over what's set to be the biggest initial public offering in history.\n\nThe reason? The firm planning to go public is the largest oil company in the world.\n\nIn a letter sent Thursday, green groups from the United States, United Kingdom and the Netherlands are pressing the chief executives of seven of the largest banks in the world not to underwrite the IPO of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-own petroleum giant.\n\nThe pressure comes as many financial institutions, still trying to regain public trust after the financial crisis a decade ago, have begun to think and talk about how best to move resources away from fossil fuel projects and into renewable energy or other climate investments.\n\nWhile the talk of addressing climate change from the top ranks of the U.S. banking industry has been well received among many environmentalists, now some of those same green groups are asking Wall Street to put their money where its mouth is, as it were.\n\n\u201cAll these banks are talking a lot more about sustainability,\u201d said Patrick McCully, director of the climate and energy program at Rainforest Action Network, which organized the letter. The forthcoming Saudi Aramco IPO, he added, \u201creally stands out as the biggest infusion of capital into the fossil-fuel industry since the Paris climate agreement\u201d in 2015.\n\nThe Saudi royal family, which claims its state-run firm is worth $2 trillion, has for months toyed with the idea of an IPO to diversify away from oil production. But Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, 350.org and other groups that signed onto the letter suggest that pumping more money into Saudi Aramco will only allow it to double down on other fossil-fuel sections, such as by expanding its oil refining capacity and investing in natural gas and petrochemicals.\n\n\u201cAll of you have at various times expressed your concern about climate change and your support for the Paris Agreement,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cIf you go ahead as lead coordinators in raising tens of billions of dollars for the world\u2019s biggest climate polluter \u2014 funds that will be at the disposal of a government that continues to commit appalling human rights violations \u2014 it will be clear that your words of environmental and social concern are devoid of all sincerity.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time environmentalists have seen lenders as a potential pressure point in stopping fossil-fuel projects. The Rainforest Action Network and other groups have mounted similar campaigns against banks invovled in the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.\n\nBut Saudi Aramco's potential public offering is far bigger than any of those North American pipeline projects \u2014 and involves dire human-rights abuses too, the green groups say. Among the issues cited was the 2018 assassination of Post contributing columunist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, which the CIA has concluded was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe public offering approaches as many of the big banks have committed to draining their portfolios of fossil-fuel investments, recognizing a role in reducing climate change. Bank of America and Citi have said they will reduce their exposure to coal mining. HSBC has said it will stop most new investments in oil sands and Arctic drilling.\n\nAt a public session at the New York public library during a week of climate activities in September, Daniel Klier, global head of sustainable finance at HSBC, said that one of the \"most urgent\" tasks was to address \"the mismatch of where money sits and where money needs to go.\"\n\nA number of banks, including Citi, just last month signed onto a series of U.N.-backed \u201cresponsible banking\u201d principles that include bringing environmental factors into lending decisions.\n\nThe other banking firms targeted in the letter are Credit Suisse, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Though nothing is official yet, last month Reuters reported that Saudi Aramco will give those seven banks, along with two Saudi-based investors, top roles in the IPO.\n\nInternational leaders, too, have sought to incentivize investments in renewable energy projects in developing countries, many of which are highly dependent on coal, by providing subsidies aimed at reducing the risk of making those sorts of loans.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to force a paradigm shift,\u201d said Yannick Glemarec, executive director of the Green Climate Fund, which is an outgrowth of the 2009 U.N. climate agreement in Copenhagen. He said his fund was established by international leaders before the 2015 U.N. climate summit \u201cin recognition that the window of opportunity to avoid catastrophic climate change was shutting very fast.\u201d\n\nCredit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. The remaining five banks did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nSteven Mufson contributed to this report.\n\nYou are reading The Energy 202, our must-read tipsheet on energy and the environment.

(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\n\u2014 The unbearable heat in Qatar: In the latest installment of The Post\u2019s \u201c2C project,\u201d Steven Mufson details how Qatar, one of the hottest places on Earth, is grappling with its devastating heat.\n\nThe World Cup it's hosting in 2022 is emblematic of many problems: The date has already been moved November, to opt for the milder winter and avoid the possibility of hundreds of thousands of soccer fans struggling or dying in the summer heat. Qatar already air-conditions its outdoors, and now outdoor air conditioners have been built in the open-air soccer stadiums to prepare for the tournament. Unlike in many of the world\u2019s poorest places dealing with the effects of climate change, the very wealthy Qatar can afford such perks, though it\u2019s not a long-term solution.\n\nThe date has already been moved November, to opt for the milder winter and avoid the possibility of hundreds of thousands of soccer fans struggling or dying in the summer heat.

Unlike in many of the world\u2019s poorest places dealing with the effects of climate change, the very wealthy Qatar can afford such perks, though it\u2019s not a long-term solution. AC is \u201cpart of a vicious cycle\u201d: \u201c Carbon emissions create global warming, which creates the desire for air conditioning, which creates the need for burning fuels that emit more carbon dioxide,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn Qatar, total cooling capacity is expected to nearly double from 2016 to 2030, according to the International District Cooling & Heating Conference. And it\u2019s going to get hotter.\u201d\n\nCarbon emissions create global warming, which creates the desire for air conditioning, which creates the need for burning fuels that emit more carbon dioxide,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn Qatar, total cooling capacity is expected to nearly double from 2016 to 2030, according to the International District Cooling & Heating Conference. And it\u2019s going to get hotter.\u201d The big picture: \u201cAlready one of the hottest places on Earth, Qatar has seen average temperatures rise more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, the current international goal for limiting the damage of global warming ... Over the past three decades, temperature increases in Qatar have been accelerating. That\u2019s because of the uneven nature of climate change as well as the surge in construction that drives local climate conditions around Doha, the capital. The temperatures are also rising because Qatar, slightly smaller than Connecticut, juts out from Saudi Arabia into the rapidly warming waters of the Persian Gulf.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Perry won\u2019t say whether he\u2019ll comply with subpoena: Energy Secretary Rick Perry declined in an interview on Fox Business Network to say whether he will listen to Congress. \u201cHey, listen,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThe House has sent a subpoena over for the records that we have. And our general counsel and the White House counsel are going through the process right now. And I\u2019m going to follow the lead of the, of my counsel on that.\u201d The deadline is Friday to turn over the trove of documents lawmakers have requested related to the administration\u2019s engagements with Ukraine.\n\nPerry\u2019s dilemma: Providing documents could make him vulnerable to Trump\u2019s ire after keeping a relatively low profile during his tenure atop the Energy Department. But defying a congressional subpoena could have worse consequences.
