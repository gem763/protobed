They have identified 380 confirmed and probable cases in 36 states and one territory, including six deaths.\n\nA look at what we know so far about the outbreak as the investigation continues:\n\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\n\nPatients are coming into hospitals with cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and vomiting.\n\nHOW SERIOUS ARE THESE ILLNESSES?\n\nMany of the reports involve severe, life-threatening illnesses in previously healthy people. Many patients received oxygen. Some needed to be put on breathing machines before they recovered. Antibiotics didn\u2019t work, and it\u2019s not clear yet whether steroid drugs helped.\n\nWHAT VAPING PRODUCTS ARE INVOLVED?\n\nNo single device, ingredient or additive has been identified. Most of the patients say they vaped products containing THC, the high-producing ingredient in marijuana. Others say they vaped only nicotine and others say they vaped both THC and nicotine.\n\nWHAT\u2019S UP WITH THE PROPOSED FLAVOR BAN?\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House said federal regulators will develop guidelines to remove from the market all e-cigarette flavors except tobacco.\n\nThe ban is aimed at the growing popularity of flavored nicotine vape formulas among teens. Health officials said Wednesday that preliminary data shows more than 1 in 4 high school students reported vaping this year, compared with 1 in 5 students in 2018.\n\nFlavorings have not been directly linked with the lung illnesses.\n\nIS THERE A COMMON THREAD AMONG THE ILLNESSES?\n\nDoctors believe this isn\u2019t caused by a germ. Instead, they suspect chemical exposure. And vape juice contains many possible culprits.\n\nAfter testing products, New York has focused its investigation on vitamin E acetate, which recently has been used as a thickener, particularly in black market vape cartridges. Suppliers say it dilutes vape oils without making them look watery. Vitamin E is safe as a vitamin pill or to use on the skin, but inhaling oily vitamin E droplets into the lungs can trigger pneumonia.\n\nTwo other states doing their own testing also have found that most samples contain vitamin E.\n\nImmune cells containing oily droplets have been found in the lungs of some patients. These large cells, called macrophages, are the cleanup crew of the immune system. University of Utah doctors think this could be a marker for vaping injury. They wrote up their findings about six patients in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS IN VAPE LIQUIDS?\n\nMost e-cigarettes contain colorless, flavorless chemicals such as propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, which create an inhalable vapor when heated. The chemicals are considered safe as food additives but their long-term effects when inhaled have not been studied.\n\nResearchers have found cancer-causing chemicals in e-cigarette vapor, such as formaldehyde. However, it\u2019s not yet clear whether those chemicals are present in high enough amounts to cause harm.\n\nE-cigarette vapor contains tiny particles that carry flavorings. Some early-stage laboratory and animal studies suggest these flavor particles can damage the lungs, airways and blood vessels, but more research is needed to better understand how human bodies react to them.\n\nMuch less is known about the contents of THC oils and how those chemicals behave when heated.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule anything out at this point because we know so little,\u201d said Dr. David Christiani of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nIS THIS BRAND NEW?\n\nThere have been occasional reports of similar illnesses, including one from 2000 that was tied to inhaling homemade marijuana-infused oil vapor. The large number of cases is new and alarming to public health officials.\n\nWHO IS INVESTIGATING AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING?\n\nState and federal health officials are testing products and analyzing cases for clues.\n\nNew York is issuing subpoenas to three companies that sell vaping additives made from vitamin E acetate. The state wants to know more about the ingredients, the quality of the raw materials, any safety testing performed, sales of the products during the past three years and what other additives the companies sell.\n\nARE PRODUCTS FROM STATE-LICENSED DISPENSARIES SAFE?\n\nMost of the cases involve products purchased on the street, not in dispensaries in states with legal sales of medical or recreational weed. A person who died in Oregon, however, had used an e-cigarette containing marijuana oil purchased from a dispensary.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oregon authorities said they would ask store owners to voluntarily review products on their shelves and pull any they feel might be unsafe. Stores will also be asked to post warnings about the potential dangers of vaping. One large Oregon marijuana retailer told the AP it stopped selling 68 vape pens because they contain additives that aren\u2019t precisely identified on product labels.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE BEST ADVICE RIGHT NOW?\n\nHealth officials are urging people to stop vaping and to get medical care if they have trouble breathing or chest pain after vaping.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Mike Stobbe in New York, Matthew Perrone in Washington and Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.
