But last week the House of Representatives ethics committee launched an investigation into whether she had an inappropriate relationship with an aide in her congressional office, which is banned under House rules.\n\nShe denied the claim in a letter to constituents but did admit to an \u201cinappropriate\u201d relationship with a different, unnamed staffer on her congressional campaign. Compromising photos of Hill and alleged text messages from her to the female staffer surfaced online in a rightwing outlet and on DailyMail.com.\n\nThe congresswoman, who is involved in a divorce, announced her resignation on Sunday and followed up with the video statement in which she condemned \u201cmy abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives\u201d.\n\nShe continued: \u201cThis coordinated campaign carried out by the rightwing media and Republican opponents, enabling and perpetuating my husband\u2019s abuse by providing him a platform, is disgusting and unforgivable and they will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nI will not allow my experience to scare off other young women or girls from running for office Katie Hill\n\nHill \u2013 one of the few openly bisexual women in Congress \u2013 said she had been the victim of \u201ca horrible smear campaign\u201d. She did not offer a direct apology.\n\nBut she said she could not allow herself to be \u201ca distraction\u201d from the constitutional crisis currently facing America \u2013 presumably a reference to House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.\n\nHill thanked supporters and vowed to continue to fight for democracy, justice and equality.\n\n\u201cAnd I will also take up a new fight,\u201d she said. \u201cI will fight to ensure that no one else has to live through what I just experienced. Some people call this electronic assault, digital exploitation; others call it revenge porn. As a victim of it, I call it one of the worst things we can do to our sisters and our daughters.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI will not allow my experience to scare off other young women or girls from running for office. For the sake of all of us, we cannot let that happen. I\u2019m hurt, I\u2019m angry, the path that I saw most clearly for myself is no longer there.\u201d\n\nHill fought back tears as she concluded: \u201cI never claimed to be perfect but I never thought my imperfections would be weaponised and used to try to destroy me and the community I have loved for my entire life. For that, I am so incredibly sorry.\u201d\n\nHill has not provided evidence of abuse by her husband, Kenneth Heslep, but claims she turned elsewhere for companionship because of their intolerable relationship.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, court papers show that Heslep argues he was rejected by an ambitious wife after agreeing to be a stay-at-home husband. He says she left him soon after being elected to Congress.\n\n\u201cOur agreement was that I would stay at home and take care of all the domestic duties and responsibilities while [Hill] worked,\u201d Heslep said in documents filed in July in Los Angeles superior court, the AP reported.\n\nReaction to the resignation was divided, with some arguing Hill was the victim of an alienating husband who put out \u201crevenge porn\u201d and found the media and political operatives only too willing to conspire.\n\nRobby Soave, editor of Reason magazine and author of Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump, tweeted: \u201cThe more I read about Katie Hill \u2026 the more it seems like she should not resign, at least not without an investigation. Her ex sounds like the bad guy here, and this story has only become significant because of a horrific invasion of her privacy.\u201d\n\nHill has asked US Capitol police to investigate potential legal violations in the posting and distribution of the photos online without her consent.\n\nThe 'AOC effect' is real \u2013 and it's helping wean the Democrats off mega-donors | Meaghan Winter Read more\n\nThe House ethics committee investigation was triggered by allegations that Hill had a sexual relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, in possible violation of a House rule that came about following the #MeToo movement.\n\nHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Hill in a statement on Sunday for bringing \u201ca powerful commitment to her community and a bright vision for the future\u201d to the House.\n\nBut she added: \u201cShe has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a member untenable. We must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s political descent was as swift as her rise. In the 2018 midterms, she won the last Republican-held House seat anchored in Los Angeles county, reflecting a wider sweep as Democrats regained the chamber.\n\nShe beat two-term Republican Stephen Knight, capturing the district for her party for the first time since 1990.", "description": "Democratic congresswoman decries \u2018coordinated campaign\u2019 by conservative media and Republicans that forced resignation", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/039c8a916858cc078eb1b01e2efb6ae0899c23c1/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=83367f7687473ebbf93b6f3504e004cc", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
