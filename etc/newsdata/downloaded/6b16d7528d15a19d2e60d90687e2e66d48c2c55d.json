The company\u2019s iPhone sales have now declined from the previous year for four straight quarters. Apple\u2019s profit dipped 3% to $13.7 billion, but the earnings per share of $3.03 topped analyst projections.\n\nIn another encouraging sign, Apple\u2019s sales in China continued to recover from a sharp drop-off earlier this year. That helped ease worries that Apple might be bruised by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nApple also signaled its confidence that the momentum will continue in the current quarter, which spans the crucial holiday season. The Cupertino, California, company projects revenue will climb by about 4% from the same time last year.\n\nPart of that growth will likely come from a hotly anticipated video streaming service called Apple TV Plus. It\u2019s scheduled to debut Friday to compete against industry pioneer Netflix and a slew of new entrants, including Disney Plus and HBO Max.\n\n\u201cYou can tell from the guidance we are bullish,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a Wednesday conference call.\n\nMore:Ranked: All the major streaming services, from Netflix to Apple TV+ to Disney+\n\nMore:Apple TV Plus launching Friday with lowest price for major subscription service\n\nAdd it all up, and it becomes easier to see why the stock market\u2019s sentiments about Apple have changed dramatically since the company warned earlier this year that iPhone sales were falling, especially in China. That flop coming out of last year\u2019s holiday season made it clear that the iPhone was losing some of its luster, raising fears that Apple might have its best days behind.\n\nThose worries hammered Apple\u2019s stock, driving down the price to $142 in early January.\n\nBut the stock has been setting new highs this month as investors began to realize Cook had crafted an effective strategy to counteract the waning demand for iPhones. The stock\u2019s recovery translates to a nearly $500 billion swing in fortune for Apple\u2019s shareholders as the company\u2019s market value has soared back to $1.1 trillion \u2014 roughly the same level as its long-time rival, Microsoft.\n\nApple shares increased $3.24 to $246.50 in Wednesday\u2019s extended trading after the company revealed its fiscal fourth-quarter financial report.\n\nApple\u2019s recent success has been driven largely by strong growth in its services division, which primarily feeds off the roughly 1.4 billion iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches already in use. The division already is prospering from app store commissions, device repairs, digital payments and Apple\u2019s music-streaming service.\n\nServices generated $46 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s just-ended fiscal year, accounting for 18% of the company\u2019s revenue. Just three years ago, services accounted for 11% of Apple\u2019s revenue.\n\nAnd now it appears poised to reel in even more revenue from video streaming.\n\nApple is selling its streaming service for just $5 per month, less than half the price of Netflix\u2019s most popular plan. It\u2019s also giving it away for a year to anyone who buys an iPhone, iPad or Mac computer in attempt to quickly amass tens of millions of subscribers. The service will start off with a handful of TV series, including one starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, but Apple is promising to spend billions of dollars on other shows and movies as part of its effort to catch up with Netflix, which boasts 158 million subscribers.", "description": "Company sees massive growth in Wearable and Services divisions, which include iCloud, Apple Watch, Music, AirPods, Apple Care and other products.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af5296ae9fe40dd573789d48fff1c680c45fc213/c=0-135-1632-1053/local/-/media/2019/10/30/USATODAY/usatsports/MotleyFool-TMOT-63a493e9-aapl-q4-earnings.jpg?width=1632&height=918&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
