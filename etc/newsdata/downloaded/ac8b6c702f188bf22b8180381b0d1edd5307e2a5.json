And sometimes a person makes peace with not having kids if she falls in love with someone who doesn\u2019t want them.\n\nNow, that\u2019s a different scenario from staying with a partner who truly isn\u2019t right for her because she fears not meeting anyone else. Healthy relationships require open communication, and you have reason to wonder about her boyfriend\u2019s refusal to discuss his divorce with your daughter. I say \u201cwonder\u201d because you don\u2019t have enough context to fully understand this one piece of secondhand information. For example, he may be hiding something from her or avoiding commitment, but it\u2019s also possible that he won\u2019t discuss the divorce because of the way your daughter interacts with him about it. Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s going through emotionally (his grief or sadness or anger) as he ends his marriage and he feels criticized rather than supported when he brings up the divorce. Maybe she demands that he say or do certain things when communicating with his wife, thus overstepping her role in the dissolution of their marriage. Maybe she insists on telling him what he should be getting in their divorce settlement or demonizes his wife whenever the topic of the divorce comes up. In other words, she may have trouble hearing him agenda-free, the way you may struggle to hear your daughter agenda-free\u2014and that may be why he doesn\u2019t talk to her about it.\n\nYou won\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on in this relationship until you\u2019re ready to listen, without interjecting \u201cYes, I know, but what about\u2026\u201d You might want to start by asking her to tell you about what she likes about her partner, and some of the fun they have together. Let her know that you relate to how much better life seems when you go to sleep at night next to someone you love\u2014and that she must really value having that in her life right now. Ask her about the good things in the relationship and delight in her joy, because her joy is as real as your concern. If you make room between the two of you for a more balanced view of the relationship, both of you may be better able to tolerate the nuances of your relationships that feel so threatening to each of you right now (for you, her happiness with her boyfriend; for her, your worries about him).\n\nSometimes when people are given the opportunity to talk openly in a safe and trusting context, they hear themselves more clearly, and they feel that an emotional burden they have been carrying alone has lifted. Once she realizes that you\u2019re really there to understand and listen, you might at some point\u2014perhaps in this conversation, or likely in another\u2014say something like \u201cI wonder what it\u2019s like for you, not knowing what\u2019s going on with the divorce. How are you feeling about that?\u201d She may justify what her boyfriend is doing with whatever line of reasoning he gave her, or she may acknowledge that she finds this dynamic challenging or anxiety-provoking. Again: Just listen. The more you listen, the more inclined she\u2019ll be to share with you\u2014and more important, the more she\u2019ll be able to hear herself.", "description": "If she stays with her current partner, I\u2019m worried that she\u2019ll end up alone, childless, and unhappy.", "authors": ["Lori Gottlieb"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/its_her_life_final/facebook.jpg?1569812898", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
