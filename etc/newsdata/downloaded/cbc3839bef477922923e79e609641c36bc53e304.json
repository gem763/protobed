The second floor also encompasses the master suite, which has its own balcony overlooking the pool and views over Los Angeles, images of the home show.\n\n\n\nThe first floor houses another four bedrooms, plus a more intimate family room.\n\n\n\nMr. Dorsey, 42, primarily lives in San Francisco, where he owns a two-parcel, $30 million-plus spread built on a cliffside overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, Mansion Global has reported.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: A Lamborghini Veneno Could Fetch US$6.3 Million at Bonhams\n\nThe entity that manages those San Francisco properties purchased the Hollywood Hills home a little more than a year ago, paying $4.225 million, according to property records. Mr. Dorsey could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the tech mogul ever used the home as his own. For a time, his friend, model Raven Lyn Corneil, stayed in the house, from which she posted numerous photos on her Instagram account over the past year. Ms. Corneil could not be reached for comment.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-103686?size=1.8740849194729137&width=1280"}
