The financial hub has been rocked by four months of pro-democracy street demonstrations involving escalating violence from activists and police\n\nLam's remarks came after experts claimed that China had quietly doubled its troop levels in the semi-autonomous city with a so-called routine 'rotation'. Pictured, Chinese soldiers People's Liberation Army (PLA) show off their military might in Hong Kong on June 30\n\nLam (pictured) reiterated today that her government still hopes to resolve the crisis itself\n\nLam's remarks came after Asian and Western envoys last month claimed that China had quietly doubled its troop levels in the semi-autonomous city by sending over extra soldiers in August in a so-called 'routine rotation'.\n\nPrevious satellite pictures also showed that China mobilised in August hundreds of military vehicles and more than 10,000 paramilitary police officers to Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong.\n\nChinese military also issued warning that they could hit Hong Kong 'in 10 minutes' and carried out multiple live-fire anti-riot drills in Shenzhen in warning to pro-democracy protesters.\n\nA People's Liberation Army soldier holds a banner to warn protesters on Sunday during a rally against the mask ban, the first interaction between Beijing's troops and Hong Kong activists\n\nArmored personnel carriers of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) pass through the Huanggang Port border between Chinese mainland and Hong Kong on August 29\n\nChina accuses Hong Kong's last British governor of being 'cold-blooded' China has called Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, of being 'cold-blooded' after Mr Patten billed the new mask ban in Hong Kong as 'absolutely madness'. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam on Friday invoked a colonial-era emergency law introduced by Britain to pass the legislation. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Patten said Lam 'would have to be crazy to be making these decisions on her own'. He also warned that 'people are going to get killed' in the increasingly violent unrest. Mr Patten should 'look at himself in the mirror' and reflect about his remarks, said the Office of the Commissioner of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong. The Office said Mr Patten ignored the fact that Britain was a forerunner in using the anti-mask law in the London Riots in 2011. '[His comments] completely exposed his true colour of being hypocritical, stubborn and cold-blooded,' the Office said. 'We again urge Chris Patten to immediately withdraw his black hand and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs, stop harming Hong Kong with evil deals and stop doomsday craziness.'\n\nLam said seeking Chinese intervention was provided for under Hong Kong's constitution, but that she cannot reveal under what circumstances she will do so.\n\n'I still strongly feel that we should find the solutions ourselves.\n\n'That is also the position of the central government that Hong Kong should tackle the problem on her own but if the situation becomes so bad, then no options could be ruled out if we want Hong Kong to at least have another chance,' she told a news conference.\n\nThe protests started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial but have since morphed into a larger anti-government movement.\n\nProtesters say the bill is an example of Beijing's increasing influence over the former British colony, which was promised a high level of autonomy when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nThe unrest has pummeled tourism and hurt businesses in the global financial hub, further bruising the city's economy as it grapples with effects of the US-China trade war.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to ensure a 'humane solution' in Hong Kong. He warned that any 'bad' outcome could hurt trade talks ahead of negotiations in Washington on Thursday.\n\nHardening her government's stance on the protests last week, Lam invoked a colonial-era emergency law to criminalise the wearing of masks at rallies.\n\nBut the move fueled more anger, with continuous daily violence over the long holiday weekend.\n\nThe PLA has maintained a garrison in Hong Kong since the former British colony was returned to China in 1997.

CCTV indicated the decision was prompted by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's remarks in Japan following a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey last week that supported anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong. 'We're strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver's claim to support Morey's right to freedom of expression,' CCTV said. 'We believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.' Morey apologised on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted on the weekend. His initial tweet included an image captioned: 'Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.'\n\nThe city was nearly paralysed after masked activists hurled petrol bombs at police, smashed metro stations and vandalised businesses with links to mainland China.\n\nPolice arrested 14 men and 12 women aged between 13 and 33 during Sunday's chaos.

Lam appealed for peace when the legislative session reopens, warning that further disruptions would set back the approval of bills and impede the city's development.\n\nFootage shows a police officer drawing his gun and shooting an 18-year-old protester\n\nA protester wears a Guy Fawkes mask in defiance of the new law banning activists from covering their faces during a standoff with police in Mong Kok on October 7\n\nThe city's subway and trains, that carry some five million passengers daily, mostly reopened Tuesday but will shut early amid fear of more protests.\n\nThe entire MTR network was shut down Saturday, with limited services the last two days.\n\nFootage from RTHK shows a group of black-clad protesters thrashing a train bound for mainland China with hammers and steel bars on Friday - the first time a train carriage had been attacked.\n\nStudents from La Salle College wear masks, which have been banned at protests under emergency powers, as they walk to school in Hong Kong on October 8\n\nThe city's metro system, which carries some five million people daily, was entirely shut on Saturday after many stations had been stormed and smashed.
