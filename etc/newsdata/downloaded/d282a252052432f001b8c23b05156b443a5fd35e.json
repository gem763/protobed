Standard Chartered, which is also among banks in Hong Kong that have unveiled such initiatives, declined to comment.\n\nHSBC is expected to post a drop of 11 per cent in its third-quarter pre-tax profit to $US5.3 billion ($7.79 billion), according to average analysts' estimates compiled by the bank.\n\nStress tests\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade as increasingly violent protests continue.\n\nUnderscoring concerns about the outlook for corporate profits, both banks have started conducting \"stress tests\" on some of their local clients, the people said.\n\n\"Given the huge importance of the Hong Kong market to HSBC's profitability, should the current protests continue, it will inevitably drag on earnings,\" said Ali Miremadi, investment director at GAM, who currently does not hold the lender's stock.\n\nThe protests have also resulted in global banks, especially HSBC, given its large presence in China and Hong Kong, having to undertake a delicate balancing act as a result of heightened scrutiny of their stances on the unrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternally, senior managers at HSBC have been informally told to be very sensitive in talking about or dealing with the team on issues related to the protests, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nBeijing has long used different methods to punish foreign corporations that offend it.\n\n\"HSBC has absolutely no option but to go along with the government. Anything different would risk their licence to operate. Just look at what has happened to the NBA after a single tweet,\" Miremadi of GAM said.\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) was plunged into controversy earlier this month after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators.\n\nThe incident has already cost the league substantial financial losses in China, a market worth an estimated $4 billion for the league.\n\nReuters", "description": "Five months of political turmoil in Hong Kong are set to weigh on the results of HSBC and Standard Chartered banks next week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_79/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/19ba81d4b4bbb16ff56323d570567e773b62acb5", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
