(Photo by Kevin Mazur/WireImage)\n\nJames Harden is making some bold claims about the Rockets, and they have little to do with how he and Russell Westbrook will handle being reunited in the backcourt.\n\nThe Beard is now on record as saying Houston will have the best-dressed team in the history of sports. And it may be hard to prove him wrong.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget P. J. Tucker and Tyson Chandler,\u201d Harden told GQ Magazine recently. \u201cWe got a nice roster of guys who love to dress and look good. The tunnel is going to be like a real fashion-show runway, so we\u2019re going to have to figure out a way to get some music down there. But everybody is going to look good in their own way, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so dope.\u201d\n\nAs for how things will look once they all get on the court together, Harden was a bit more reserved, if not pragmatic.\n\nHarden and Westbrook haven\u2019t been NBA teammates since 2012. They\u2019ve both grown into MVP-winning superstars with distinct styles and aggressive playmaking skills. It\u2019ll take time to get in sync, but Harden is looking at the big picture here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, yo, we\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Harden said. \u201cEverything isn\u2019t necessarily going to be smooth at first, there are going to be ups and downs, and that\u2019s part of an 82-game season. Hopefully by the end of the season, we\u2019ve caught a rhythm and everybody is on the same page going into the playoffs. That\u2019s all you can ask for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like me and Russ were just teammates in Oklahoma City for three years. We\u2019ve known each other since we were 10 years old. There\u2019s a different kind of relationship and communication that we have, a different type of excitement that we have for each other. We don\u2019t really care or pay attention to what other people say or think.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThat may be for the best. The noise coming into this season will certainly be deafening in Houston \u2014 and that starts with team owner Tilman Fertitta.\n\n\"I think we put ourselves in the position that if we don't win it in the next three or four years, we probably aren't going to win one in the next 10 years,\" Fertitta told Yahoo Sports. \"This is our window, and we need to seize the opportunity.\"\n\nHowever this season shakes out, Houston can be confident knowing they\u2019ll at least look good when they get on the court. Everything after that remains to be seen.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nBlake Schuster is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
