Steve Bullock\u2019s campaign had an announcement to make: He, too, had said a bad word! \u201cGovernor Bullock on The Daily Show: I\u2019ve Actually Had to Get S--- Done,\u201d blared its news release.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic primary has at times felt like a competition over who can employ the most strategic curses. The majority of candidates have uttered at least one (depending upon how you define \u201ccurse\u201d), and you can see lots of examples in the video above. We seem to be headed in a direction of more rather than fewer in the months ahead.\n\nIt was probably inevitable. We\u2019ve got a foul-mouthed president, relative to his predecessors, who has tempted Democrats to emulate his norm-breaking ways. President Trump has cursed at least 87 times in public, during speeches, interviews and on Twitter, according to Factba.se transcripts, and he\u2019s cursed more each year he\u2019s been in office (only seven times in 2017, but 46 thus far in 2019).\n\nWe\u2019ve also got a Democratic Party that is righteously angry about Trump\u2019s presidency, and we\u2019ve got a crowded Democratic field in which pulling stunts is sometimes the only way to get noticed.\n\nBut to be clear, the cursing is often a stunt, and transparently so. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the most vulgar words, both by quantity and quality, have been uttered by those toward the bottom of the polls. I\u2019ve often said that if you\u2019re cursing, you\u2019re losing. And the four candidates who lead in the polls \u2014 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris \u2014 have kept it almost completely clean during their candidacies.\n\nThe most vulgar candidate also happens to be the one who has lost the most ground. O\u2019Rourke swore off swearing in early April, when he was near 10 percent in the RealClearPolitics average. Today, he\u2019s at about 2 percent and has unleashed a growing torrent of foul words \u2014 particularly when talking about the issue of gun violence.\n\nGiven the mass shooting that took place in his hometown of El Paso, that\u2019s understandable. But now O\u2019Rourke has taken things a step further and is selling campaign T-shirts that say \u201cThis is f---ed up\u201d repeatedly, on top of \u201cEnd gun violence now\u201d and \u201cBeto for America.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s vulgarities have been less plentiful but more awkward. In April, Castro appeared on Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show and dropped two \u201cbulls---s.\u201d Both times, Maher seemed pained to hear the politician try so hard. \u201cOh!\u201d Maher said. Then Castro repeated the sentence, and Maher again said, \u201cOh!\u201d\n\nA couple of months earlier, Castro used the word while talking to NPR about why young Latinos aren\u2019t speaking Spanish. \u201cWhoa, did you just say BS?\u201d his interviewer asked. \u201cI did,\u201d Castro affirmed with an air of self-satisfaction. Earlier that month, he told New York magazine \u201c50 percent of headlines are bulls---.\u201d Castro has also run a TV ad in which he quotes President Trump saying \u201cs---holes,\u201d though it\u2019s beeped out.\n\nCory Booker used that word in July\u2019s debate, and CNN wasn\u2019t quick enough to censor it. He has also said that \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d for victims of gun violence are \u201cbulls---.\u201d When some on the right raised questions about Harris\u2019s heritage, Booker tweeted Harris \u201cdoesn\u2019t have s--- to prove.\u201d And his campaign manager at one point tweeted a text message in which Booker called Trump\u2019s comments about gun violence \u201ca bulls--- soup of ineffective words.\u201d\n\nOther examples:\n\nNot that the major candidates have never had potty mouths. Joe Biden\u2019s occasional curse words were a focus during the 2012 campaign (remember \u201cBFD\u201d?). Harris is reportedly fond of a compound swear word involving a female parent, and she used it in a 2017 New York Times interview. She also said the f-word publicly in 2017. And Sanders in 2015 offered a \u201cbulls---\u201d at one point.\n\nBut even as their opponents have moved in that direction, they haven\u2019t repeated their past sins in 2019. And the most ascendant candidate in the 2020 race, Warren, once remarked that her favorite swear word was \u201cpoop.\"\n\nThe odd swear word can be effective when deployed in the right circumstances. But the more everybody is using them, the less novel and effective they become. They can also quite easily come off as contrived and desperate. We know politicians are constantly measuring the things they say and that they aren\u2019t supposed to swear publicly. So when they do curse, it\u2019s difficult not to at least think it might be calculated.\n\nDemocrats can occasionally try a little too hard too \u2014 especially when it comes to playing Trump\u2019s game. Whatever you think of Trump, his vulgarity doesn\u2019t seem contrived because he\u2019s never been a polished politician. And what Democrats don\u2019t need right now is for people to believe their passion is superficial and that they\u2019re uttering bad words because they think it will poll well or get people to pay attention to them. That\u2019s the danger here.", "description": "A few well-placed curses makes some sense, but this is getting ridiculous.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2jSceierruge7zkJcjhKbD0BNJA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7PIE4BEYSQI6TGQW3RKR5JNEHM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
