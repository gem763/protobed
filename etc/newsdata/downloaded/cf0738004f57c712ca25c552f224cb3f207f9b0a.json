It neither confirmed nor denied the possibility of attacks using some sort of acoustic weapon.\n\nCuba has denied all responsibility for the incidents.\n\nThe Canadian study concluded that the Canadian diplomats were likely exposed over a period of time to low doses of neural blockers in commercial pesticides.\n\nCuba routinely sprays pesticides to kill disease-carrying insects, including an aggressive campaign against mosquitoes started in 2016 to stop the spread of the Zika virus.\n\nDiplomatic offices and residences were sprayed, according to embassy records cited by Radio-Canada.\n\n\"It's just the beginning of the research,\" lead researcher Alon Friedmond told the public broadcaster, explaining that his team has continued to assess the various toxins that might be at play.\n\nJohn Babcock, a spokesman for Canada's foreign ministry, which commissioned the study, told AFP that \"no definitive cause of the health incidents has been identified to date\" but the government is continuing to explore \"all avenues,\" including the Halifax research.\n\nNo new cases have been reported since December 2018.", "description": "Neurotoxins in pesticides used to fumigate against mosquitoes may be behind mysterious health complaints of Canadian diplomats in Cuba that had been blamed on suspected sonic attacks, according to a new study Thursday.
