Inmates Saw a Bloody Beating.", "language": "en", "text": "The Great Meadow Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison in upstate Comstock, N.Y., on Nov. 19, 2016. (Caleb Kenna/The New York Times)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 After spending nearly a quarter-century behind bars, John McMillon was counting down to the day that he would be eligible to be released on parole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d a fellow inmate recalled him saying.\n\nMcMillon suffered from mental illness and had disciplinary problems over the years. He was punished for assaulting a guard and for fighting with another inmate, but had then vowed to stay out of trouble, and was looking forward to his parole board hearing.\n\nHe never made it there.\n\nOne day in January, McMillon, 67, was involved in a struggle with guards at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility in upstate New York. According to the official account, he once again attacked a guard and resisted efforts to control him. He died of a heart attack, the official autopsy said.\n\nAs far as state investigators were concerned, the case was closed.\n\nBut several inmates who witnessed the struggle told a much different story.\n\nFour inmates, all of whom were interviewed separately and in person by The New York Times, said they witnessed McMillon being harshly beaten by guards.\n\nAn additional five inmates provided similar accounts to prisoners\u2019 rights groups.\n\n\u201cThey killed that man,\u201d one of the inmates, Pernell Griffin, told the Times. \u201cThere was a lot of blood. He was screaming in pain.\u201d\n\nIt is unusual for inmates to speak out so forcefully about allegations of brutality behind bars. Many fear retaliation by guards.\n\nThe inmates differed with respect to some details, but they all offered the same basic narrative: McMillon was returning from dinner and asked to go back to his cell. He then began behaving erratically, though not violently, the inmates said.\n\nThe inmates said that in response, a female guard approached and punched him in the face. Several other guards also responded and beat him, the inmates said. One inmate said he saw McMillon being choked.\n\nState investigators independently interviewed the same inmates, who made similar assertions that McMillon was beaten, according to an inquiry by the Washington County district attorney, J. Anthony Jordan.\n\nBut guards told state investigators that they merely tried to restrain McMillon, and the inquiry said the guards\u2019 body camera footage supports their statements. State prison officials have not released the footage.\n\nSeveral of the inmates who spoke to the Times and prisoners\u2019 rights groups said guards retaliated against them because they spoke to state investigators.\n\nThe starkly conflicting accounts of the struggle deepened the questions surrounding McMillon\u2019s death.\n\nGovernment watchdog agencies and nonprofit groups have long expressed concern about what they said is a culture of brutality at Great Meadow, a troubled maximum-security prison with 1,415 inmates in Comstock, more than 200 miles north of New York City.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo toured Great Meadow last year in response to the turmoil there. On the day of his visit, the prison was on lockdown following fights among inmates \u2014 the third violent incident at the prison that week.\n\nA correction officer there had also been suspended for beating an inmate. The governor said the problems at the prison demonstrated the need for statewide prison reform.\n\nGreat Meadow ranked third highest of all the prisons in New York for rates of assaults on inmates and assaults on staff in 2016, according to the most recent data collected by the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit group that has the authority under state law to monitor prisons.\n\nThe association found that of the state\u2019s maximum-security facilities, the prison had the highest incidence of guards using force against inmates.\n\nLast year, several inmates filed lawsuits against the prison charging brutality by guards.\n\nMcMillon\u2019s family has sharply criticized the official determination of his death. His sister, Carolyn Hodge, said that when she first called the local coroner\u2019s office for information about the cause of death, she was told McMillon had been strangled.\n\nA photo that family members took of his body when it was brought to a funeral home shows visible marks around his neck and face.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I will be able to forgive them for what they did to my brother,\u201d Hodge said.\n\nThomas Mailey, a spokesman for the state Department of Correction, said in a statement that investigators\u2019 conclusions were based on an extensive review of body camera footage and interviews with guards and prisoners.", "description": "NEW YORK -- After spending nearly a quarter-century behind bars, John McMillon was counting down to the day that he would be eligible to be released on parole.\"I'm going home,\" a fellow inmate recalled him saying.McMillon suffered from mental illness and had disciplinary problems over the", "authors": ["Jan Ransom"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/U1AOqHWioRBqn22zkjoE0w--~B/aD0yMTkzO3c9MzI4OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/49e5e1e097c03c1becbd266faaf4cf93", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
