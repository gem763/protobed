This is an improvement from Wednesday morning, when the PM2.5 concentration ranged from 89 to 119, and was classified \u201cBand II, Elevated\u201d.\n\nPM2.5 is the main air pollutant during the haze season, and NEA recommends checking its concentration level for current air quality, especially before immediate activities like jogging.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that a total of 238 hotspots were detected in Sumatra, mostly in the southern provinces of Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra.\n\nModerate to dense smoke haze continued to emanate from hotspots in central and southern Sumatra, and some smoke haze was blown by the prevailing winds to affect Singapore and parts of Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe weather over Sumatra is still forecast to remain dry and the haze situation there is expected to persist, NEA said.\n\nAs prevailing winds are forecast to blow from the southeast or south, Singapore may continue to experience hazy conditions.\n\nIt added that 1-hr PM2.5 concentration readings are expected to range between Band I (Normal) and Band II (Elevated) in the next 24 hours, and the 24-hr PSI is forecast to be in the high end of the Moderate range and the low end of Unhealthy range. NEA also warned that depending on wind conditions, the PSI in Singapore may enter the mid-section of the \u201cunhealthy range\u201d.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - All schools in Selangor, Penang, Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur were ordered closed on Thursday and Friday..
