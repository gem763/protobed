You were bald when I met you 20 years ago.'\n\nHowever Megan honestly admitted: 'I'm not gonna lie I used to have a lot of lip filler in my top lip and it was a bit embarrassing now I look back and I've had them taken out.\n\nStunned: Following the performance Megan received a standing ovation from the judges including Simon Cowell, who was left speechless by her heartfelt song\n\nBefore and after: The former TOWIE star, 27, admitted she has even taken the dramatic step of having her lip filler removed in order to be taken more seriously as an artist (pictured before removing the filler earlier this year)\n\n'I want to be seen as an artist so I can't be on stage looking like that can I.'\n\nFollowing the performance Megan received a standing ovation from the judges including Simon Cowell, who was left stunned by her heartfelt song.\n\nMegan was the third contestant to audition at Simon's Malibu mansion and her original song performance left the music mogul speechless.\n\nThe reality star, whose song High Heeled Shoes reached number one on iTunes, previously auditioned for the civilians version of X Factor in 2014 and 2015.\n\nJumping to Megan's defence, Simon jumped in and said: 'What have you done [Louis]?

This is my dream and I\u2019m just hoping that this show can just be the start really, because I want to do this full time.\u2019\n\nMegan told how she made a decision to take a step away from the small screen for a while as she focuses all her energies on her music career.\n\nShe said: \u2018I chose to come off TV for a while. I just really wanted to be taken seriously in my music and I feel like I\u2019ve done the reality shows and I\u2019ve loved it, but sometimes you just need to pull away and take time for yourself.\n\n'I feel happy now and I\u2019m ready to start a new show. What better way to start than doing the X Factor? This is my dream show.'", "description": "The former TOWIE star, 27, admitted she has even taken the dramatic step of having her lip filler removed in order to be taken more seriously as an artist.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937868-0-image-a-127_1571520314478.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
