The time it takes for the pulses to bounce back is measured, allowing researchers to work out the distance to the object or surface they strike. Combined with location data, the approach allows scientists to build 3D maps of an area.\n\nAn image derived from Lidar data showing \u2018neighbourhoods\u2019 in Angamuco, a city built by rivals to the Aztecs.

Fisher.\n\nThe method has already helped reveal ancient cities deep in jungles and map the full extent of sites built by rivals to the Aztecs.\n\nThe resolution of aircraft-based Lidar data can lead to images with stunning detail. \u201cWe can see things on the ground that are on the order of 20cm or so \u2026 which is about the size of a construction brick,\u201d said Fisher.\n\nFisher said the idea to use Lidar to create a global map came to him after hearing of the work of CyArk, a non-profit organisation which uses digital techniques including laser scanning to record cultural monuments and sites in 3D.\n\n\u201cI came to realise that is great, but those archaeological sites are just a tiny fraction of what we are actually about to lose in the next couple of decades because of the climate crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nFisher said that Lidar works well over land and the ice caps. As a result the project will focus on the planet\u2019s land area: roughly 29% of the Earth\u2019s surface. Fisher says the first areas to be recorded will be those most under threat, such as coastal regions at risk from sea level rises and the Amazon, where deforestation is surging under the Bolsonaro government in Brazil.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Logs along the road to Jacunda national forest, near the city of Porto Velho in Brazil\u2019s Amazon.

The Earth Archive will also contain data from other techniques including aerial photography and satellite data, some of which already exists.\n\nThe result, Fisher said, will be an open source record of the planet which could help archaeologists, geologists, conservationists and others.\n\nBesides revealing manmade structures within jungles, Lidar can also reveal details such as the age and complexity of forests. The data can also be used to reconstruct landscapes and to track changes to the landscape over decades.\n\nBuilding the Earth Archive will not be cheap: Fisher estimates it would cost about $10m (\u00a38m) to scan much of the Amazon within two or three years.\n\nHe says a large part of the cost lies in getting the equipment to the required location, while filtering the data takes people power. While Fisher said the team was seeking funding, he said some organisations had already pledged to donate services in kind.\n\nFisher\u2019s plans have had a mixed response from others in the field. While most say such a resource would be valuable, they say the practical hurdles are considerable.\n\nKevin Tansey, professor of remote sensing at the University of Leicester, welcomed the project, but said Lidar was expensive and time consuming. What\u2019s more, changes in some areas are happening so quickly that landscapes could be altering drastically even as data is collected.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Lidar instrument in operation at Davis station in Antarctica. Photograph: HO/REUTERS\n\nProf Mat Disney of University College London raised concerns the project\u2019s expensecould divert money away from other research. What is more, he added, getting permission to map certain areas could prove difficult.\n\n\u201cWho is going to give them permission to fly over Brazil? The Brazilian government aren\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nDr France Gerard of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology also has mixed feelings.\n\n\u201cI think conceptually it is a great idea,\u201d Gerard said. She added that many countries such as the Netherlands were already carrying out Lidar surveys.\n\nHowever, Gerard has concerns over areas being captured at different points in time. \u201cThe date of the observations will vary tremendously across the globe,\u201d she said.\n\nGerard said there were also questions about whether the raw data would be made available, and what sort of data would be collected.\n\nBoth she and Disney note there have already been space-based Lidar projects that offer consistent, global-scale data and are providing valuable information on forests, albeit at a far lower resolution than aircraft-mounted Lidar \u2013 this lower resolution is something Fisher says is problematic.\n\nFisher says his project will take time but will be valuable. \u201cI won\u2019t live long enough to see the results of this project, none of us will, and our kids won\u2019t live long enough,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is for their grandchildren, and their grandchildren, and their grandchildren.
