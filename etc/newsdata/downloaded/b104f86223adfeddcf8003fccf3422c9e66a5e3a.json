It\u2019s been this kind of slow trickle to one thing opens, another thing opens, another thing opens, and then it kinda exploded.\u201d\n\ncaption HESCO barriers are temporary structures installed for flood control. source Ormipix Media\n\nThe city of 100,000 people deals with rising water levels every year and has relied on temporary structures, called HESCO barriers, to protect itself from flood damage for over a decade. When the Mississippi began to swell this spring, the barriers went up just like before.\n\n\u201cThey were the same ones, the same process, the same ones that have held all these times,\u201d said Mayor Klipsch.\n\nOn April 30th, the barriers failed.\n\ncaption Several blocks of Davenport\u2019s downtown were submerged. source Ormipix Media\n\nThe day of the flood\n\n\u201cI saw the Mississippi River coming up Pershing Avenue,\u201d said real estate investor Pete Stopulos. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh my God, the wall broke.'\u201d\n\nLopiez Pizza was getting ready to open its doors for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe had our scheduled meeting with the health inspector,\u201d said owner Andrew Lopez. \u201cAnd right when she came in, all the water started coming up through the drains and everything.\u201d\n\nAs the river poured into the streets of downtown, volunteers and emergency crews scrambled to help.\n\n\u201cAll of us who sort of converged in the downtown area just immediately started looking for where we could grab sandbags to start to try and seal up the buildings and things,\u201d recalled Grubbs.\n\nThe last time Davenport faced anything like this was in 1993.\n\n\u201cI was a kid and I actually remember canoeing down Second Street,\u201d said Bush.\n\nThe Great Flood of 1993 destroyed towns across nine states and set record-high crests in nearly 100 locations. This year, Davenport became one of the few places to have ever broken its 1993 record.\n\n\u201cReally, we all lived with water for about a week,\u201d Grubbs said. \u201cEven if it wasn\u2019t coming in through the door anymore, it was coming up through cracks. We were taking turns manning pumps 24/7 to get the water out.\u201d\n\nWhile no lives in Davenport were taken, much else was lost. \u201cThere have been a lot of people who put a lot out,\u201d said Bush. \u201cReally put their lives behind reviving our downtown. People who were taking out bank loans, people who were using their homes as collateral.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was overwhelming,\u201d Lopez added. \u201cWe invested a lot of time and money into everything, and we thought that we were just gonna have an empty shell of a business.\u201d\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nSoon after the floodwaters receded, tensions began to sink in. Thirty-six business and property owners wrote a letter to city officials demanding full transparency about what went wrong.\n\n\u201cWe realize that we can\u2019t just rely on them to do the right thing, which is unfortunate,\u201d said Stopulos. \u201cIs the city going to protect us moving forward?\u201d\n\nAt the city\u2019s request, the US Army Corps of Engineers looked into the cause of the breach. They found that record rainfall and pressure from a swollen Mississippi had led the HESCO barriers to lose friction and slide out of place.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the heights of the flood, it would have been perfectly fine. Well, this was a record,\u201d Mayor Klipsch said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier in the aftermath to look back at what could have or should have been done.\u201d\n\ncaption Some Davenport business owners wondered why the city hadn\u2019t taken more preventative measures. source Ormipix Media\n\nMany residents questioned why the city hadn\u2019t taken more precaution, given that historic floods had been forecasted over a month before the breach happened.\n\n\u201cI would like to just know who they reached out to, what kind of expertise they got before preparing for this flood, knowing that it was coming,\u201d said Bush.\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers said the city did not request its assistance in planning for the barriers. And HESCO declared that the flood was not caused by a structural fault of the barriers themselves.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think publicly anybody\u2019s taken accountability,\u201d said Stopulos. \u201cBut is it necessary? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if that gets us to where we need to be in the future.\u201d\n\nThe future is now what most residents are concerned about.\n\n\u201cFlood\u2019s over, enough complaining about the flood. Let\u2019s just get back out there and start hustling,\u201d said Lopez.\n\nBush said, \u201cPart of me really wants to focus on what happened, and the other part of me wants to move on and just say okay, how can we prevent this from happening again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see more flood activity like this,\u201d Grubbs said. \u201cSo with that in mind, how do we respond as a city?\u201d\n\ncaption Now that the flood is over, residents are focused on rebuilding. source QC Drone\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nOver the summer, the mayor launched a Flood Task Force to open the dialogue between city officials, business owners, experts, and residents about developing a long-term flood plan.\n\n\u201cImmediately somebody said, \u2018Build a wall, build a flood wall,'\u201d Mayor Klipsch said. \u201cWell, we realized that it\u2019s a lot more complicated.\u201d\n\nTo build one now would come with a price tag of at least $175 million.\n\n\u201cThe local taxpayer would be very, very challenged to do this on our own,\u201d he added.\n\nBusinesses in Davenport already expect to lose $30 million in revenue and wages over the next year, and flood insurance won\u2019t do much to alleviate those costs. \u201cFlood insurance does not cover lost rent,\u201d said Stopulos.\n\nBush said, \u201cI think people think that flood insurance will cover everything, and what we learned the hard way is that it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs weather patterns grow more and more extreme, many worry about the next time this happens. \u201cWhat we experienced which was a record flood could potentially become the norm here, and that\u2019s the really scary thing,\u201d said Bush.\n\nWhat any city chooses to do will flow downstream, leading some to argue for a whole-basin approach to flood planning. \u201cIt\u2019s an interrelated system, the whole Mississippi River corridor,\u201d explained Mayor Klipsch.\n\n\u201cWe do need a system in place to protect all of our riverfront,\u201d Stopulos agreed. \u201cAnd it needs to be one that keeps other communities in mind to the south of us. We can\u2019t just push our problems down river.\u201d\n\nBut others say the priority is to act fast. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point where we need to protect Davenport. We need to do it now,\u201d said Bush. \u201cWe can\u2019t be responsible if the cities below us don\u2019t protect us just as we don\u2019t fault the ones above us for not taking in some of the water.\u201d\n\nThe Flood Task Force is still working on a plan to submit to the City Council.\n\ncaption Businesses are expected to lose $30 million as a result of the flooding. source City of Davenport Government\n\nBuilding back\n\nLopiez Pizza along the waterfront finally opened for business two months after the breach.\n\n\u201cWhen the doors opened, it was like just a flood of people. It was like an insanely different kind of flood,\u201d said Lopez.\n\nBut the memory of the actual flood hasn\u2019t quite evaporated. \u201cEvery time it rains, even just a drop, I\u2019m looking out the window hoping that nothing\u2019s gonna back up again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe local Chamber of Commerce recently raised over $400,000 for businesses recovering from the flood \u2013 and now, all but a few have reopened.\n\n\u201cPeople are rebuilding,\u201d Stopulos said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to rebuild here. They can pick up and move uptown, or behind a flood wall in another community. But they realize that there\u2019s something about being down here in downtown Davenport that makes it worthwhile.\u201d\n\nBut with the river still in its backyard \u2013 flowing within reach \u2013 the threat of future flooding looms. And the need for Davenport and hundreds of other communities to protect themselves from the Mighty Mississippi feels ever more urgent.", "description": "Business Insider - Davenport, Iowa is the largest city along the Mississippi without permanent flood control, and its flooded downtown was one consequence of that decision..
