But they do have no margin for error with the wild-card race tightened up. (Jim Mone/AP)\n\nThere is such a thing as must-win games in baseball.\n\nJust don\u2019t ask the Washington Nationals to admit that. Definitely don\u2019t ask them to right now. Doing so wouldn\u2019t fit their whole \u201cone day at a time\u201d approach. Doing so could indicate, if only indirectly, that they are beginning to feel the pressure of the pennant race. Doing so is out of the question.\n\nBut this is the reality the Nationals have played themselves into with 10 days and 11 games left in their regular season. They have no choice but to beat up on the Marlins in Miami this weekend. They open the series at 7:10 p.m. Eastern Friday. They lead the Milwaukee Brewers by just a game for the National League\u2019s top wild-card spot. The Chicago Cubs are just a game behind the Brewers. The Nationals have lost of 10 of their last 16 games and, in the process, turned a surefire playoff spot into a question mark.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, in the first days of September, Washington had a seven-game cushion between making the postseason and not. That\u2019s all but disappeared and now, with three whacks at one of baseball\u2019s worst teams, the Nationals\u2019 margin for error has, too.\n\n\u201cIt just takes a team effort. Everybody has to have a hand in it. It can\u2019t be one guy. It can\u2019t be two guys. It\u2019s got to be all 25,\u201d Nationals ace Max Scherzer said in St. Louis on Wednesday of how they can get back on track. \u201cWe have to be out there getting contributions from everywhere. Everybody has a hand in why we win. So if we\u2019re in a little funk, fine, so be it. But we can easily get out of it.\u201d\n\n[Boswell: Playoff chases are fun, aren\u2019t they, Nats fans? Why are you hiding under your desk?]\n\nScherzer\u2019s assessment came after the Nationals dropped two of three to the St. Louis Cardinals. That finished a 13-game stretch against first-place teams \u2014 including the Atlanta Braves, Minnesota Twins, the Braves again and the Cardinals \u2014 and it was fair for the Nationals to regress a bit. But their record against winning teams is concerning. They went 2-5 against the Cardinals this season. They went 8-11 against the NL East-leading Braves, 2-4 against the Brewers, 3-5 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, 3-4 against the Arizona Diamondbacks and, maybe most consequentially, 7-12 against the New York Mets.\n\nThey are 9-5 against the Philadelphia Phillies, whom they host for five final games next week, but the rest makes simple logic apply: If you don\u2019t excel against contenders, and still want to be one, you better beat up on easy opponents. That\u2019s how the Nationals vaulted themselves up the standings this summer, easing the sting of a 19-31 start and eclipsing teams that weren\u2019t as sharp facing lesser clubs. And it\u2019s exactly how Washington needs to view this weekend.\n\nThe Nationals have been mostly handled the Marlins this year. Losing two of three in April was the exception. Their 13-3 record in the season series is the full picture. The Brewers, who have won 12 of 14, close their season with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies, all sub-.500 teams. The Cubs have six more against the Cardinals, the team both they and the Brewers are chasing in the NL Central, and that logjam could actually help Washington in the end.\n\nAll of the popular projections still give the Nationals a 90 percent chance or better at playing in the wild-card game on Oct. 1. But the Nationals\u2019 breakneck September only has one short break, algorithms aside, and that\u2019s this series in Miami. They otherwise finish with the five-game series against the Phillies, equipped with a split doubleheader Tuesday followed by three with the Cleveland Indians next weekend. The Phillies are clinging to wild-card hopes and, either way, will be interested in playing spoiler. The Indians are right behind the Tampa Bay Rays for the American League\u2019s second wild-card spot.\n\nThey\u2019re all playing for something. The Phillies and Indians want to make the postseason despite themselves. The Cubs and Brewers want to challenge the Cardinals in the Central and, if they can\u2019t, overthrow the Nationals atop the wild-card standings. Washington wants to host the wild-card game, like it was all but locked into earlier this month, while avoiding a complete collapse.\n\nThe Marlins, however, don\u2019t have any short-term objectives. They went into this season with eyes focused on a distant future. They have the NL\u2019s worst record at 53-99 and are an even 40 games back of the Braves in the NL East. Washington has An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez pitching Friday, Stephen Strasburg on Saturday and rookie Austin Voth on Sunday. Voth\u2019s start is the most vulnerable. S\u00e1nchez has been great since mid-May and Strasburg has won his last 12 appearances against Miami.\n\nThat\u2019s a decent start. But it will all mean nothing unless the Nationals take three games before flying home Sunday night. That\u2019s how must-wins work.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nHow Daniel Hudson became the Nationals\u2019 most important reliever\n\nSean Doolittle has struggled to rediscover what made him successful.
