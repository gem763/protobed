The statement came amid growing criticism of the Duterte government\u2019s failure to provide solutions to ease transport problems after a fire that suspended the operations of a key metro train line on which students rely heavily.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s spokesman, Salvador Panelo, during his three-hour commute through Manila. Photograph: Salvador Panelo\n\nPanelo left his home at 5.15am on Friday and had to take four separate jeepney, or bus, rides to get to Malaca\u00f1ang palace, the president\u2019s official residence. He reached the gate at 8.30am.\n\n\u201cIt took me a long time to wait for jeepneys because they were packed. They were always packed,\u201d Panelo said in a radio interview. At one point, he had to wait up to 35 minutes for a ride.\n\nManila's commutes from hell - a photo essay Read more\n\nHe refused to let journalists accompany him during the journey and avoided the route where he knew reporters were waiting. But he took \u201cselfie\u201d photos of himself and sent them to the media.\n\nOn Friday, Panelo again maintained there was no mass transport crisis because there is \u201cno paralysis\u201d on the roads. He said Filipinos were \u201cvery creative people\u201d who knew how to adjust to \u201chostile situations\u201d.\n\nDuterte himself did not escape public ire after an ill-timed announcement from the Philippine Air Force that it had acquired a P2-billion jet for Duterte\u2019s travels. One particular meme circulated showing the president on the plane with Panelo, laughing together after saying there was no mass transport crisis in the capital.\n\nWhile Duterte continues to enjoy high satisfaction ratings, the latest numbers show he is losing double-digit support among the poor.", "description": "Salvador Panelo tries out public transport in clogged Philippines capital after sparking anger by saying there was no transport crisis", "authors": ["Carmela Fonbuena"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54fbd84b37fbda88ea78cb9203626a67eae03ef/0_0_3341_2005/master/3341.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c68d9228564c3806eaad2f6799f1cfa8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
