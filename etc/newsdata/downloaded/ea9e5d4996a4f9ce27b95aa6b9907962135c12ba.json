This has not escaped the Street\u2019s attention, with analysts saying that a few Dow stocks are heating up.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the tone on trade has gotten better. As long as we don\u2019t have another tweet storm around trade, I think the market can stay in the upper end of this range,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n\nUsing the TipRanks Stock Comparison tool, we were able to see how a few of the index\u2019s stocks measure up against each other. We just typed in up to seven tickers and the tool compared each of the stocks based on market cap, PE ratio, analyst consensus and average analyst price target.\n\nBased on the results from the comparison, we were able to find 3 Dow stocks that have garnered substantial support from Wall Street with a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d analyst consensus. This is based on the last three months\u2019 worth of ratings from all other analysts.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nVisa Inc.\n\nVisa Inc. (V\u2013 Get Report) has had a tough week, with the payments processor seeing shares plummet almost 6% in the last three days. A few analysts say that the stock market's \"sector rotation\" as investors rotate out of big winners and into the biggest underperformers ahead of year end was to blame for this dip. That being said, some analysts are telling investors that its core strategy will pay off long-term.\n\nEven with the pullback Visa shares have gained 33% year-to-date, with the company standing to reap the benefits as the world goes cashless. According to its July 23 fiscal Q3 2019 earnings release, the company looks solid. Total payments volume, the dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying Visa\u2019s branding, jumped almost 9% year-over-year to reach $2.23 trillion on a constant dollar basis.\n\nTo further capitalize on the cashless payments movement, the company recently partnered with MoneyGram (MGI) on a peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer option that lets customers in the U.S. send money domestically through the MGI website or app to an eligible debit card. The product, which was unveiled on September 9, starts at $1.99 and enables 24-7 transfers using Visa\u2019s real-time push payment platform, Visa Direct.\n\nAdding to the good news, the Foreign Trade Commission (FTC) granted antitrust clearance for Visa\u2019s acquisition of Verifi. The deal will give V access to improved dispute management technology.\n\nOne top analyst points out that its substantial efforts to expand its business to business (B2B) payments arm are especially exciting, highlighting its July PayMate investment and Rambus acquisition back in June. As a result, Guggenheim analyst Jeff Cantwell reiterated his Buy rating and $199 price target on August 28. The five-star analyst sees potential for 14% upside.\n\nAll in all, Wall Street agrees with Cantwell. Visa boasts a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus as well as a $202 average price target, indicating 14% upside potential.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on the move thanks to an improved trade war outlook after China offered to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products if the U.S. lessened restrictions on Huawei last week.
