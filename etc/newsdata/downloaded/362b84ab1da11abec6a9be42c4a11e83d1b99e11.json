It never seems to happen, but that doesn\u2019t change the dynamic. The impulse to \u201c\u00e9crasez l\u2019inf\u00e2me\u201d (crush the loathsome thing) is so powerful that the expectation returns over and over again.\n\nThe reason nothing fundamental ever changes is that each side in our politics is so deeply entrenched in its own construal of reality. If the anti-Trump side thinks the president is undeniably revolting \u2014 a toxin that will sink the whole system of American democracy if we don\u2019t act to stop him \u2014 the right is divided. Some (Trump\u2019s strongest supporters) think he can do no wrong. But many others are well aware that he\u2019s corrupt. They just see the corruption as a slightly more egregious form of the debasement that pervades Washington and elite culture more broadly. From Congress and the executive branch to the mainstream media, the universities, Wall Street, and Hollywood, those who run the country rig the system to benefit themselves and try to conceal it beneath a cloak of high-minded BS. Trump might be a self-obsessed crook, but at least he doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything better than a self-obsessed crook.", "description": "", "authors": ["Damon Linker", "Theweek.Com Articles Impeachment-Panacea"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
