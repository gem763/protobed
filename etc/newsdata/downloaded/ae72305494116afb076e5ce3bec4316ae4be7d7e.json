I never felt like I was on a diet.\n\n\u201cThe eating plan encourages you to eat lots of tasty, filling foods like pasta, rice, potatoes and lean meat and fish.\n\n\u201cYou are never hungry and no foods are banned so there\u2019s no deprivation.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d found a way to lose weight without starving myself.\u201d\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire Live / MEN Media)\n\nBernice says it isn\u2019t just about the food you put in your mouth.\n\nShe also sees a personal trainer once a week and regularly enjoys power lifting challenges.\n\nShe said: \u201cSlimming World isn\u2019t just about changing what you eat. Becoming more active is important too.\n\n\u201cOur Body Magic programme takes the threat out of activity by showing people, many of whom have unpleasant memories of being forced to take part in activity at school, how they can build activity into their daily routine without having to take up traditional forms of exercise like going to the gym or running.\n\n\u201cEverything counts from walking to gardening to washing the car.\u201d\n\n(Image: Lincolnshire Live / MEN Media)\n\nBernice is now turning her attention to helping others change their lives for the better and has successfully completed the required training to become a consultant and run her own session in Lincoln.\n\nShe said: \u201cSupport is really the most important thing. It all starts with feeling that you\u2019re not alone.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have lost six stone without the weekly help, encouragement and understanding of my own consultant and group.\n\n\u201cAs someone who has lost weight myself I know the challenges people can face, which is why, along with the group, I will be there to support every one of my members all the way to their chosen target weight.\n\n\u201cSetting targets, sharing recipes and other ideas, and working together as a group to overcome challenges and celebrate success is so important to a successful journey.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why at my Slimming World group, there\u2019ll be tons of support, encouragement and fun.\u201d\n\nKatie Cowie, who runs Slimming World\u2019s Wednesday Brant Road group and manages Bernice as a team developer, says: \u201cSlimming World consultants are chosen for their positive outlook and because they genuinely care about the health and happiness of others.\n\n\u201cWith Bernice\u2019s experience of being a successful Slimming World member and her kind and warm personality and great sense of humour I just know that she\u2019ll be an amazing support to members, cheering them all the way to their target weight.\u201d", "description": "Bernice Casserly, from Lincolnshire, used to watch other girls 'walk around in little bikinis feeling happy and confident' while she 'hid behind giant maxi dresses'", "authors": ["Ashley Franklin", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Lincolnshire Live", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20753246.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS197191073.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
