Food52 says it generated about $30 million in revenue last year but isn\u2019t profitable.\n\nFood52 previously raised $13 million from investors including Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments Inc. and Scripps Networks Interactive, which was acquired by Discovery Inc. last year.\n\nFounded in 2009 by Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, veteran food journalists who worked for the New York Times, Food52 offers recipes and home-improvement tips as well as selling its own products to online shoppers. Two of its top sellers are an apron with built-in potholders ($45) and a double-sided cutting board with an extra-deep juice-trough ($59).\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nFood52 incorporates guidance from its audience while developing its products, Ms. Hesser said. The popular apron and cutting board were informed by suggestions from Food52 readers, who responded to a survey on the company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cIn retail, there\u2019s almost no interaction between the consumers and producers,\u201d Ms. Hesser said. \u201cWe wanted to break down those walls.\u201d\n\nFood52 is among a crop of media companies that make much of their revenue from e-commerce\u2014both by selling their own products online and by referring their readers to online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. to buy other products. If a reader buys a product from Amazon, Food52 gets a cut of the sale.\n\nSales of products from the company\u2019s own line, dubbed \u201cFive Two,\u201d are much more common and more profitable than affiliate sales on Amazon. Food52 gets a tiny fraction of its revenue from affiliate sales, a company spokesman said.\n\nFood journalists Merrill Stubbs and Amanda Hesser founded Food52 in 2009.

The company\u2019s line of custom home goods was selling briskly, and the co-founders decided to take on additional investment to grow that business.\n\n\u201cWe realized that there was huge potential to really blow this out,\u201d said Ms. Stubbs.\n\nTCG was founded in 2018 by Peter Chernin, the former chief operating officer of News Corp., the parent company of Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co., alongside Mike Kerns and Jesse Jacobs. TCG owns a controlling stake in MeatEater Inc., a digital media company aimed at hunters, fishermen and home cooks, and has also invested in Action Network, a sports-betting analytics startup.\n\nPudding is made at the Food 52 test kitchen.

The company also plans to hire staffers for computer engineering and product development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning to open our first store over the next year, as well as pop-up [stores],\u201d Ms. Hesser said.\n\nSome of TCG\u2019s investment is being used to buy out existing shareholders.\n\nMr. Kerns of TCG said Food52\u2019s product line and affiliate revenue made it attractive among media operators.\n\n\u201cWith respect to verticalized digital media companies, we think it\u2019s important for those businesses not to be advertising-based,\u201d Mr. Kerns said. \u201cWe look for diversified business models.\u201d\n\nWrite to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com", "description": "Food52, a media and e-commerce business that sells upscale home goods, said it sold a majority stake to venture firm TCG for $83 million.", "authors": ["Benjamin Mullin", "Benjamin.Mullin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111990/social", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
