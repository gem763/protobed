So he decided to go solo. Foster, 35, joined many of his peers leaving financial services giants to launch their own independent practice. Eager to test their entrepreneurial chops, they confront myriad challenges from convincing clients to follow them to finding office space to navigating regulatory compliance issues.\n\n\u201cI was tired of the hit-quotas-and-sales rat race,\u201d said Foster, a Houston-based certified financial planner. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re part of a very large national broker-dealer, you\u2019re in a box\u201d with little freedom to customize your marketing or use social media to build visibility and control your messaging and brand identity.\n\nMore than 800 advisers fled wirehouses or broker-dealers to join RIAs in the past five years, according to Financial Planning magazine. Many of them face emotional and financial hurdles as they seek to reconfigure their business model, recover their startup costs, and set up internal processes to support their new operation.\n\nReflecting on his first year of independence, Foster credits a few early moves for helping him hit the ground running. At his old firm, he earned a commission on investment or insurance products that he sold to many of his pre-retiree clients. Now he wanted to build a fee-only practice for a younger clientele, so he sold nearly his entire book of business to another adviser and started afresh with a target market of individuals and families in their 30s.\n\n\u201cMy ideal client profile is a 34-year-old female, married with one child or one on the way, with a household income of $150,000,\u201d he said. Rather than pitch commission-based products, Foster charges clients an upfront fee ($1,500-$6,000) plus a monthly retainer ($200-$600).\n\n\u201cI wanted to provide comprehensive financial planning services in a way they could afford,\u201d Foster said. Because millennials are accustomed to a monthly subscription model, he figured they\u2019d embrace his fee structure. He\u2019s signed on 14 households thus far.\n\nLike other advisers who\u2019ve gone independent, Foster emphasizes the importance of formulating a clear vision for the first two years on your own. As part of your planning process, he suggests addressing questions such as:\n\n\u2022 Whom will you work with?\n\n\u2022 What value will you bring to clients?\n\n\u2022 What will you charge?\n\nKnowing that his income would take a hit in the early going, Foster built a nest egg before quitting his old firm. He also joined XY Planning Network, a membership organization that offers technology and compliance support and other benefits to independent advisers. Once he left, he saved money on rent by negotiating favorable terms on a WeWork shared office site in his area.\n\nWhile Foster sold off most of his book of business, other advisers who plan a move to independence invest significant time and care into communicating with clients during the transition. The goal is to reduce confusion and fear so that clients understand what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s to gain by sticking with their longtime wealth manager.\n\nWithin two weeks of Charles Adi leaving his employer to open his own practice in 2017, the certified financial planner called all 80 of his clients to inform them of the situation. Because he had set up his own customer relationship management (CRM) platform three years earlier \u2014 separate from the one his employer used \u2014 he had access to his clients\u2019 contact information and accounts.\n\n\u201cI got in front of it so clients heard first from me that I had left,\u201d Adi said. \u201cI wanted to be their point of contact. I told them I had all their account information and I was monitoring their accounts during the transition, and that gave them peace of mind.\u201d\n\nAssuring them of his intent to remain in the business as an independent adviser \u2014 and giving them a sense of how long it would take (in his case, two months) for him to complete the registration process and open his new firm \u2014 helped solidify his bond with them.\n\nOften advisers are limited in how much client data they can take when they leave a large firm. So-called \u201cprotocol\u201d agreements among financial firms are commonplace; they impose strict rules on what pieces of information outgoing advisers can retain.\n\n\u2018Once you make the decision to leave, you want to be as close to your clients as you\u2019ve ever been.\u2019 Financial adviser Rob Carrigg Jr.\n\nIn the months leading up to Rob Carrigg Jr.\u2019s move from a big firm to join Steward Partners Global Advisory, an independent partnership, he laid the groundwork by checking in with his clients. While he wasn\u2019t able to tell them about his upcoming plans, he found that simply reaching out and staying in touch proved valuable.\n\n\u201cOnce you make the decision to leave, you want to be as close to your clients as you\u2019ve ever been and tie up as many service-related loose ends as possible,\u201d said Carrigg, a certified financial planner in Portsmouth, N.H. \u201cThat creates some awkwardness when you can\u2019t mention you\u2019re going to move. But after you move, you can explain why \u2014 that it would\u2019ve been a breach of a contractual obligation with your old firm \u2014 and they\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\nLike Adi, Carrigg prioritized talking to clients in the immediate aftermath of his departure. With protocol agreements in place, he could only keep a few bits of basic information on each client. He prepared for each call by thinking through each client\u2019s unique situation and anticipating their questions and concerns.\n\n\u201cWhen you leave, a clock starts ticking,\u201d Carrigg said. \u201cYou want to spend as much time as possible contacting your clients. This was the biggest decision of my life. My wheels were spinning 24/7 on how to make this work.\u201d\n\nMore: Listening to these podcasts might push you to save for retirement\n\nRead: Why DIY investors still might want a financial adviser", "description": "It\u2019s wise to be careful and conscientious about leaving a big firm to go independent.", "authors": ["Morey Stettner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI539_office_ZG_20190430124922.jpg"}
