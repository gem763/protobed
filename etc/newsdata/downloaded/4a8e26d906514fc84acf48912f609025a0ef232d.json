I'm gonna run away!'\n\n'He was at the door and looked at me with sad little eyes, and I took a deep breath and reminded myself of the emotions inside that little heart of his,' she wrote.\n\nCollecting herself, Laura caught her son off guard by pretending to agree - but not before explaining how much she would miss him.\n\n'He wasn't expecting the response and looked at me confused, but quickly said 'I don't care!'\n\n'I said 'Okay, but I'll miss making you peanut butter and jam sandwiches, and I'll miss giving you big cuddles in the morning, and letting you dunk biscuits in my tea... and I'll miss tickling you and dancing with you. I'll miss your big smile and your big heart.'\n\nLaura convinced her young son to calm down and forget his plans to run away from home by telling him how much she would miss him\n\nLaura's reassurance worked and Luca agreed to stay, but 'only because she would miss him so much'.\n\nThe post quickly racked up almost 3,000 likes and hundreds of comments from fellow parents praising her approach.\n\n'That's gold! What a beautiful relationship you have, pat yourself on the back,' someone wrote.\n\n'I love this. Well done for reacting with love and compassion - it's the hardest thing to do but absolutely the best way,' another said.", "description": "Australian parenting blogger and mum-of-three Laura Mazza, 33, recently revealed how she uses reverse psychology to cope with her children's moods and stop tantrums before they escalate.", "authors": ["Alice Murphy For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/02/20016096-0-image-a-2_1571708368594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
