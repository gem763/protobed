Vulture is taking a close look at the nominees until voting closes on August 29. Photo: HBO\n\nIt sounds odd to call a show about the aftermath of a nuclear disaster a \u201csurprise hit.\u201d But that\u2019s an apt description of Chernobyl, the HBO limited series that explores the many mistakes made during and after the famous 1986 explosion at the Soviet nuclear power plant. The series received critical acclaim, became unexpectedly buzzy, and did very well in terms of ratings. It\u2019s also in the running for 19 Emmy Awards.\n\nAhead of next month\u2019s ceremony, we caught up with the creator and writer of the series, Craig Mazin, whose credits prior to making Chernobyl included The Hangover Part II and Part III and Identity Thief. Mazin talked about the political relevance of the show, why writing this complex limited series was actually much easier than writing comedy, and why the scientist played by Emily Watson needed to be a female character.\n\nGiven the show\u2019s sobering subject matter, I\u2019m guessing you were surprised by how many people watched Chernobyl.\n\nI mean, I thought some people would watch it. The estimate of the audience would be \u201csome amount of people.\u201d We were proud of the show we made and we thought that the \u201csome amount of people\u201d that watched it would appreciate it. What we did not anticipate \u2014 and I think this covers everyone involved \u2014 was the way it seemed to just grow and grow and turn into this moment, this fascinating thing.\n\nIt speaks to the value of the traditional way of releasing television episodes, rather than just sort of dumping things all at once. The week-by-week release of Chernobyl helped create a kind of snowball effect. By the time we reached the end, it felt like we had occupied some sort of interesting place in culture. What I noticed, and maybe this is the most gratifying thing, is that the show has become allegorical for a number of things. It\u2019s not like anyone just sat there and said, \u201cWell, we watched the show, and we all took away that you don\u2019t want to be near the Soviet Union when they\u2019re testing nuclear reactors.\u201d They see all sorts of allegories in it. Political allegories, scientific allegories, and problems are starting to be examined through the lens of what happened in Chernobyl, and that\u2019s the most I could\u2019ve ever hoped for.\n\nDo you think that one of the reasons so many people were interested in the series is because of what you just said? That they were seeing connections between then and now in terms of the political climate and the damage that lies can do?\n\nI think \u2014 and this is a guess \u2014 that people engage with the show for the same reason I became obsessed with Chernobyl. The circumstances of Chernobyl, and the fact that it takes place behind the Iron Curtain in the \u201980s, [means] you\u2019re getting a glimpse at something remarkable, that you didn\u2019t even know happened. It draws you in because it is a terrifying succession of events. But when it\u2019s over, I think that is when people start to think, okay, actually, yeah, I see the parallels now. Then the more you look, the more you see them. Now, also, oddly, we\u2019re seeing non-allegorical parallels because nuclear reactors are blowing up in Russia again.\n\nYeah, I was going to ask you about that.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s remarkable. I think when you finish watching the show, you do start to realize that the point here isn\u2019t that the Soviet Union existed and it couldn\u2019t exist anywhere else. The Soviet Union was nothing more than human beings, and human beings are capable of repeating any other human mistake, anywhere at any time.\n\nI\u2019ve read about [the explosion] in the newspaper and it just reminded me, more than anything, of the aspects of my research that centered around the days following Chernobyl and the kind of news stories that were being published around the world. There\u2019s a moment in our show where Gorbachev is looking through a collection of Western newspapers and the headlines. There was just confusion and fear, and it\u2019s remarkable to me that any government hasn\u2019t learned from that, that when something like this happens, you can\u2019t hide it. You just can\u2019t. I mean, forget about the fact that you shouldn\u2019t. You can\u2019t. And yet they try. Amazing.\n\nPrior to Chernobyl, you wrote primarily comedies. Did it feel like a big shift when you were writing it?\n\nYou know, I love comedy. I love working in comedy, I love features. But I\u2019ve been doing it for, you know, 25 years. At the point I started working on Chernobyl, it had been about 20 years. 20 years is a long time to do anything, and I\u2019d done a lot of movies. I\u2019ve written not only movies you can see my name on, but movies you don\u2019t see my name on. It was a lot, and it would never stop, either. There were no breaks. And comedy\u2019s the hardest. I mean, it\u2019s just the hardest. I used to say that out of a sense of suspicion, and now I can just say it empirically. It\u2019s way harder than writing drama. It\u2019s not even close.\n\nWhy do you say that?\n\nI guess I can boil it down to this: When you\u2019re writing comedy, what you\u2019re doing is creating something that has to be so compelling and fascinating in its own specific way that you are going to elicit an involuntary physical response from people. That\u2019s different than anything else. It\u2019s like, if I said to you, \u201cOkay, you need to make a drama,\u201d and you show your drama to an audience, and you come to me and you say, \u201cOh my god, did you see? They were crying at the end.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, at the end. But they didn\u2019t cry any other time. They have to be crying, like, three times a minute.\u201d That\u2019s what comedy is. Comedy is anti-crying, three times a minute.\n\nIt\u2019s brutal. It requires a sense of logic, and it requires a kind of intellectual capacity. Some of the smartest people I know are comedy writers. You have to be transgressive, but you also have to understand character.\n\nWhen I was writing Chernobyl, it seemed very natural to me. Just natural and easy and also freeing, you know, to not feel like I was beholden to a room of people in the dark with their arms crossed over their chests saying, \u201cDo it. Make me laugh.\u201d It was nice to just worry about nothing more than, honestly, me. That\u2019s what I felt like it was: \u201cI need to please me, and I need to challenge me, and then do something that I think is beautiful, and the rest of it is the rest of it, I don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019ll probably never write that freely again, to be honest with you, because now I\u2019ve done this, and now every time I write something, I\u2019ve got to think, \u201cWell, it\u2019s no Chernobyl \u2026\u201d [Laughs.] It was a dream. Honestly, the easiest thing I\u2019ve ever done as a professional writer was writing Chernobyl.\n\nReally?\n\nNo question.\n\nYou can\u2019t start figuring out how you\u2019re going to do the production design or the special effects until you\u2019ve written the script, but as you\u2019re writing, are you thinking to yourself, \u201cMan, how are we going to do that?\u201d Or do you just push that aside and tell the story?\n\nI mean, I wrote without any cares, you know? I just wrote towards an ideal. I\u2019ve written a lot of sequels. Sequels are the hardest things to write. You have demands from everybody and everybody has a thought. Nobody was telling me what to write. Nobody was telling me how to write it. And it wasn\u2019t like anyone was saying, \u201cOh, and here\u2019s a date we need it by,\u201d or, \u201cHere\u2019s an actor we need to make happy,\u201d or, \u201cHere\u2019s the budget.\u201d Nothing. There were no constraints. It was simply, \u201cWrite something.\u201d It was wonderful. I hadn\u2019t had that experience in a long time. The movie business can be difficult, because there are artificial things in place that are already beginning to corrode the artistic intention. Before you begin, there is just stuff there, and with this, there was nothing like that. It was just simply purity of intention. And to HBO\u2019s credit, that never changed. They never interfered in that regard. Everyone basically came together and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s make this as best as we can.\u201d\n\nChernobyl ended up being five episodes. When you sat down to write it, did you have a sense of how you were going to structure it?\n\nI\u2019m the most fastidious planner there is. I pitched the general notion of what the show would be to HBO and they said \u201cOkay, go off and write a bible and an episode.\u201d A bible is, you know, you lay out your season. So that document that I created was 60 pages long and it covered all of my main characters and why they were important and what their purpose was, and then every episode was broken down by scene. It\u2019s not that I adhered perfectly to that, because as you write you will occasionally deviate, but I knew before I started writing what that show was. I knew how it began, I knew how it ended. It had to be planned. At least for a show like this, I don\u2019t think you can sort of improvise your way to something with this much stuff going on in it.\n\nInterestingly, it was going to be six episodes, and in the writing of episode two it became clear to me that episode two and episode three needed to be one episode, mostly because the events it was portraying and the period of time it was portraying, days following the explosion and the nuclear reactors, seemed to demand a kind of urgency. I\u2019ve noticed that in the new era of the limited series, there\u2019s been a kind of languidization of narrative. Writers are given eight episodes to tell a story that might only need six and they still owe eight episodes and you think, well, suddenly there\u2019s like a long montage of somebody doing something. It\u2019s like, you know, go faster.\n\nAs a critic nothing irritates me more than that.\n\nRight? You see everything and so it\u2019s probably more frustrating for you than for me, but you can feel it, right? You feel when they\u2019re just adding. Now, I found out why. After I pushed it down from six episodes to five, obviously I let HBO know that that was my plan. HBO was like, \u201cOkay, great. Terrific.\u201d And then I found out that I got paid by the episode. So [the industry] should pay them by the show and not the episode, and then you know, they won\u2019t pad out those extra episodes. That\u2019s my theory.\n\nI never thought about that.\n\nLiterally, I didn\u2019t even know.\n\nWhen you made that decision to take it from six to five, were there significant things that you lost in the process of doing that?\n\n\n\nNot really. It was just that things felt crisper. There was less sluggishness. There was a scene in episode two, it wasn\u2019t lost in the script stage, but we couldn\u2019t completely shoot it because we just didn\u2019t have the budget for what I wanted to do. That\u2019s the one thing I wish I had been able to show, which is essentially the May Day celebration, the parade, in Kiev and Minsk that happened on May 1, five days after the explosion, where people are marching in the streets and the citizens simply haven\u2019t been told that a nuclear reactor is open and burning, maybe an hour\u2019s drive away. We couldn\u2019t do it because it turns out, parades are expensive.\n\nOther than that, honestly, we got to do everything. I hope people get that sense when they watch the show that they haven\u2019t been cheated. We were given a tremendous amount of resources. We used every last dime of them and we hopefully showed people not just the scope of a terrible tragedy but also painted a picture, an accurate picture, of what life was like for regular people in the Soviet Union. Because it was not like what we thought it was here in the U.S. It was actually rather familiar to me, as a citizen of the U.S., and what a shock there. They\u2019re just people, right? And they do the things that people do and they want what people want and that was the joy, to kind of celebrate Soviet citizenry. Because in the end, it was Soviet citizenry that saved us all.\n\nRight. I wanted to ask you about Ulana, Emily Watson\u2019s character. I know she\u2019s a composite of numerous scientists who were researching and working on all of this. But how did you arrive at creating that character?\n\nLegasov [Jared Harris\u2019s character] was an interesting guy. He was very political, and it wasn\u2019t accidental that they sent him [to Chernobyl]. It wasn\u2019t simply because he was a good scientist. He was a nuclear chemist, so you know, he\u2019s still a proper scientist, but he was pretty high up at the Kurchatov, which was the big, state-run nuclear institute. So they sent him in part because he was one of their guys, but he needed help. Throughout his work there, he is consulting with scientists, and they are assisting him, they are questioning him, and some of them are aware of the problems that exist in the reactor, and they begin to gently question whether or not maybe this was the reason [for the explosion].\n\nI needed narratively to focus all of those different functions into one person, so that we could follow it. I needed somebody who would be both questioning him and have the stature to question him, someone who felt maybe even a little better at nuclear physics than him. Someone who could represent the investigation into the truth of what happened and then somebody that would challenge him and hold him accountable to that truth, without feeling intimidated by him. Then that combined with the fact that women in the Soviet Union \u2014 the Soviet state was not gender-progressive, except in one area where they were, and that is in science and medicine. The percentage of women employed in science and medicine in the Soviet system in the \u201980s was quite a bit higher than it was in the United States, possibly in part because tens of millions of men had died in World War II. So they made an allowance there where they wouldn\u2019t have necessarily made it \u2014 and didn\u2019t \u2014 in the Politburo, which was almost entirely male-dominated. So I wanted to get at that, which is an interesting circumstance \u2014 this one place where women actually were elevated and had positions of authority and importance. And I wanted to create a character that could embody all these things to challenge Legasov where he needed to be challenged. She is a character that represents a kind of scientific ideal to me, which is a bravery and a stubbornness. A willingness to be disagreeable when you have to. She\u2019s not interested in popularity. She\u2019s not interested in promotions. She only cares about the truth.\n\nThe scientists who were actually working with Legasov, I assume some of them actually were women?\n\nYes. There were a lot of names that we\u2019ll never know. There were scientists. Generally, the women who were sent there for technical reasons were medical workers. But there were scientists, female scientists, involved in Chernobyl. And I actually spoke with one who was involved in the immediate medical planning in the aftermath of the accident. These scientists, some of them did their jobs and were fine. Some of them, um, challenged things a bit too much. One scientist was reportedly put on trial, which didn\u2019t go anywhere because I guess the Soviet Union collapsed before they could actually get to the verdict. But it was a difficult time.\n\nYou said earlier that you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019ll ever write as freely as you did when you were working on Chernobyl. I\u2019m wondering, how has working on this show affected your approach to your work? Either the kinds of projects that you\u2019re pursuing, or just different approaches that you took as you were writing it? Has it changed anything about your process?\n\nThere\u2019s one thing I think that I have come to understand that I don\u2019t think I had room for before, psychological room. And that is that what I think, what I want, matters. I come from a middle-class background. My parents are public-school teachers. I didn\u2019t grow up out here. I don\u2019t know what the word is, but the antonym of entitlement? That\u2019s what I had. If you were to hire me, my obligation was to make you happy. And I think you begin to question the value of honoring your own sense of what is good and right and worthy, and you start to cast it in with a little bit of a sense of self-indulgence. But this is different. This sense of honoring what it is that you actually want to do, and not doing things simply out of a sense of obligation, is a lesson that I\u2019ve gotten from Chernobyl. When you\u2019re writing something you want to write, it\u2019s wonderful. And it sounds crazy to say that it\u2019s a rare experience in Hollywood, but it\u2019s a rare experience. Most of the time we\u2019re writing what somebody needs us to write, because we have to support ourselves and our partners and our children, and it\u2019s hard. And even when you find something you want to write, other people tell you, yeah, not that way, this way. I\u2019m trying to stick to that lesson as best as I can.", "description": "Craig Mazin, creator of the HBO limited series Chernobyl, discusses his Emmy Award\u2013nominated work on the show.", "authors": ["Jen Chaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/29/29-chernobyl.w1200.h630.jpg"}
