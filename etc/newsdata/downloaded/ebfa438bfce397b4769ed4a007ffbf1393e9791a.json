Here's an early look at four of the more than 50 vehicles that Ford promises will be on display at the annual show in Las Vegas.\n\nRTR Rambler Ford Ranger\n\nPhoto credit: Ford More\n\nFord's plans for the show include a number of modified Rangers. At first glance the RTR Rambler Ford Ranger looks like it might be the Raptor version of the Ranger, but don\u2019t get too excited, it\u2019s not. Part of the Raptor-like appearance comes from Ford Performance Parts' aftermarket lift kit. New coil springs lift the front wheels two inches, bringing the front end to the same height as the unloaded rear axle and increasing the approach and breakover angles to help the Ranger clear taller obstacles. Larger 33-inch diameter Nitto Ridge Grappler tires mount to RTR Tech 6 wheels to make sure you are able to end up somewhere remote enough to necessitate the bed-mounted tent.\n\nYakima Ford Ranger\n\nPhoto credit: Ford More\n\nYakima, the maker of vehicle racks to carry every bit of your sporting life and hobbies, has teamed up with Ford to put together the creatively named Yakima Ford Ranger. Yakima fits a rack to the Ranger's bed that attaches to a JayLow kayak mount and HangOver vertical bike carrier to take all of your lifestyle gear to the river or the trail or wherever this lifted Ranger will get you on its 33-inch BFGoodrich T/A KO2 tires and Ford Performance off-road suspension. Even if you get stuck, there\u2019s a Warn winch to pull the Ranger out.\n\nAdvanced Accessory Concepts Ranger\n\nPhoto credit: Ford More", "description": "An advance look at a few of the nearly 50 Fords that will be at the SEMA show in Las Vegas soon.", "authors": ["Tony Quiroga"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/B1Efh9TpI9z8Fh5Hh3mn3g--~B/aD00ODM7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/9050f0e41d80c1bd75da805dbc102c2f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
