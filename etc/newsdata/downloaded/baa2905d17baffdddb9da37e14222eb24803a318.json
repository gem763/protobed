An expectant nation with a history of underachievement and disappointment on rugby\u2019s grandest stage, this year\u2019s tournament comes amid heightened hope of a first title.\n\nBut while Warren Gatland can justifiably point to Wales\u2019s achievements over the past 12 months and argue that, yes, success in Japan is certainly obtainable, the home defeat by Ireland on Saturday leaves his side shrouded in a mist of curiosity and with a series of lingering questions to consider: are Wales genuine World cup contenders? Where do their weaknesses and strengths now lie? Will they be able to deliver when it matters most?\n\nThese are all questions that, in one capacity or another, fans will typically hope to answer in the immediate build-up to a World Cup. But as the summer campaign draws to a close \u2013 with the return fixture in Dublin next week their final warm-up match \u2013 Wales remain something of an enigma.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

From his perspective at least, it brought into focus those players deserving of a place on the plane to Japan. \u201cWe had a few questions answered,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was good from that point of view. We got what we wanted out of today apart from the victory.\u201d\n\nNotably, the debate surrounding Rhys Patchell and Jarrod Evans, as to who will provide back-up to Dan Bigger, has all but dissipated. There\u2019s no doubt: Patchell is the man to bring. His introduction after half-time helped fuel the Welsh comeback, the fly-half scoring a try, making two conversions and effectively bringing his big runners into the game. Evans, in contrast, looked out of his depth, his distribution and kicking off the mark in periods of the first half.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Wales were especially error-prone, with multiple handling mistakes and penalties at the breakdown only serving to hinder their cause. With so many players scrambling to prove their worth, it was perhaps to be expected \u2013 but Gatland knows that consistency is key from all his men when confronted with the pressure and grind of World Cup rugby.\n\nThe Welsh defence was found wanting, too. By the half-way stage, 20 tackles had been missed by those in red. Ireland had missed four. And with nine set-piece penalties to Wales\u2019 name, it\u2019s clear work is needed among the forwards \u2013 especially at the scrum, which was repeatedly called up by Romain Poite before eventually conceding a penalty try in the second half. Worryingly, it\u2019s been the same story for much of the summer, something Robin McBryde must address come Monday 23 September.\n\nStill, Gatland remained upbeat after the loss, pointing to the battling spirit his men showed in the final quarter of the match. This never-say-die attitude has come to define the Welsh in recent years, and of the many characteristics that Gatland has helped propagate during his 12 years in charge, it\u2019s this which he\u2019ll be notably remembered for once he steps away from the side after the World Cup.\n\n\u201cThe pleasing thing about these guys is that they showed some great character,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cThey showed what it means to play for Wales. They were disappointed with the first half. They can take a lot of pride out of the fact they didn\u2019t give up, they kept on trying.\u201d Five or so more minutes and the victory would have been Wales\u2019 \u2013 but, come the final whistle, the Irish had done enough to bounce back from the humiliation of that Twickenham defeat.\n\nWith this philosophy to hand next month, there\u2019s no doubt Wales will be a tough nut to crack. It\u2019s the willingness to fight to the bitter end that often separates the heavyweights from the pretenders, so this latest display of resilience will certainly raise hopes of a strong Welsh showing in Japan.\n\nAttention now turns to Dublin, where both Gatland and Joe Schmidt have agreed to field their strongest possible XV as they look to add the finishing touches to their preparations. That warm-up clash will be the true indicator of where this Welsh side stands \u2013 and you can\u2019t help but feel the outcome of that showdown will either embolden spirits or cast a dark shadow heading into the World Cup.\n\nGatland, though, has already made up his mind. \u201cWe have overachieved in the last 12 years and we are not finished yet,\u201d he declared deep within the heart of Principality Stadium, his home from home over the past decade and more. \u201cWhen we are mentally and physically right, we can give any team in the world a run. I believe we will go a long way in the World Cup.\u201d", "description": "For Wales, the allure of Rugby World Cup glory hangs heavy in the air.
