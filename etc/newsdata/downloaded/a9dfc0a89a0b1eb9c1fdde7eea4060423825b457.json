We have persuaded boroughs across London to get involved in this and we think there's 27 kilometres in London that are now car free.'\n\nHe went on to criticise those local authorities that he said were not doing enough to reduce air pollution.\n\nBelgium's capital Brussels also stopped traffic for World Car Free Day, leaving roads open to people on bicycles and mobility scooters (pictured)\n\nA couple were seen travelling through the typically busy streets on skateboards as the Belgian capital shut its roads\n\nA dual carriageway in Brussels was entirely empty on Sunday as motorists were banned from using roads around the capital\n\nA woman skates through the Belgian capital on a road which would typically be packed with vehicles, as cyclists pass behind\n\nIn Berlin, dozens of women decorated their bicycles with flowers and balloons as they took part in the 'Fancy Women Bike Ride' for World Car Free Day\n\nThose taking part in the event dressed in gowns, flower crowns, and wore elaborate headwear as they cycled through the city\n\nBerlin also marked European Mobility Week on Sunday, the European Commission's flagship campaign promoting clean and sustainable urban transport\n\nDozens of pedestrians, cyclists and runners were also spotted enjoying a vehicle-free Sunday in Oeiras near Lisbon\n\n'I'm frustrated by some councils being anti-walking, anti-cycling,' he said.
