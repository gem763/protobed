(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nWatching TV/using a smartphone/tablet/computer helps you fall asleep\n\nWatching something boring on your laptop or phone might seem like a good way to lull yourself to sleep.\n\nAlmost a third of respondents (30%) believed so anyway, but they couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\nIn fact, the blue light emitted by these devices actually has the opposite effect, as the blue light emitted from screens affect the brain\u2019s ability to produce melatonin, which tells the body when it\u2019s time to sleep.\n\nFar better to read a book or simply be alone with your thoughts before bed.\n\nThe older you get, the less sleep you need\n\nJust because your granny gets up at the crack of dawn doesn\u2019t mean she needs less sleep. 29% of respondents believed this, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn trials, when older people were asked to sleep as much as they could, they averaged less than younger adults tasked with the same.\n\nThose running the study were keen not to state that this meant that older people definitively needed less sleep, though, and instead concluded that there was no way to state whether it was a decreased ability or need to sleep.\n\nEssentially, sleep needs differ from person to person, and there\u2019s no need to assume that you can stay up all night as soon as you hit pension age and not feel the effects.\n\nSome people don\u2019t dream at all\n\n25% of those asked believed that some people simply have no dreams whatsoever, which may be due to the fact that they don\u2019t remember them.\n\nStudies show that, while not all people know they\u2019ve had a dream, dreaming happens in all people during the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) period of deep sleep.\n\nOne that looked at people with RBD (a condition where they move and speak in their sleep) found \u2018the observation of speeches, facial expressions and behaviours while sleeping, unbeknownst to the dreamers, suggests that dreaming production is universal, while dreaming recall is variable.\u2019\n\nOff in dreamland (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nYou can train your body to function on less sleep than needed\n\nIn the age of the bio-hack, everybody\u2019s trying to spend less time doing more things.\n\nAs if your body is simply a Rubik\u2019s Cube that need to be solved, that has also moved into the sleep sphere, with almost a quarter believing they can train their body to need less sleep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor most people (up to 99% according to some research), getting less than six hours a night can have consequences \u2013 from lower testosterone levels to insulin resistance to cardiovascular disease.\n\nThose who \u2018naturally\u2019 need less sleep tend to have a mutated gene called hDEC2, which essentially predisposes them to being \u2018short-sleepers\u2019.\n\nSo, that\u2019ll be all the entrepreneurs who do interviews saying they get three hours a night and everyone else is a lazy loser. Don\u2019t worry, needing a full night every night is perfectly normal.\n\nWorking out at night makes it harder to fall asleep\n\n\u2018Pumping iron\u2019 or \u2018feeling the burn\u2019 hardly conjure images of rest and relaxation. This may be why 23% of people think exercise is bad for falling asleep.\n\nIt is actually true that over-training can lead to insomnia, but researchers agree that moderate exercise can work wonders for your sleep cycle, with those who do around 30 minutes of exercise finding that they sleep longer and better the same night.\n\nWhy this is isn\u2019t completely clear, but it\u2019s thought that it may have something to do with body temperature and endorphins released during exercise.\n\nYou can \u201cmake up\u201d for lost sleep over the weekend\n\nHaving an early alarm in the week may mean that you\u2019re keen to make up for lost time at the weekend with a big old lie-in. While we\u2019re not going to stop you, it doesn\u2019t actually help at all.\n\nA study this year from the University of Colorado tested the theory that you could make up for sleep lost during the week, and found that it wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAssistant Professor at the university, Christopher Depner, said: \u2018Catch-up sleep does not appear to be an effective strategy to reverse sleep loss induced disruptions of metabolism.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no way to biohack your sleep cycle (Picture: Ella Byworth)\n\nFalling asleep with wet hair will give you a cold\n\nGiven that colds are a virus, going to sleep with wet hair or dry hair will have no effect whatsoever on whether you get one.\n\nApologies to the older members of your family, who have definitely told you this at one point or another.\n\nAn hour of sleep before midnight is worth more than two after\n\nA whopping 23% of people believe this myth, which probably came from parents who wanted their kids to go to sleep on time.\n\nWhile those who are \u2018early birds\u2019 and go to bed earlier are shown to be more successful, there shouldn\u2019t be a direct correlation between sleep times and quality of sleep.\n\nThere are caveats, in that you need to make sure you have some semblance of circadian rhythm. For example, you won\u2019t get effective sleep in a light room, as your body assumes this is wake-up time.\n\nIt also only makes sense if you\u2019re actually getting around eight hours of sleep (or less if you\u2019re one of these mythological short-sleepers). You can\u2019t simply go to bed at 3am, get up at 7am, then be confused at why you\u2019re tired.\n\nThe brain is inactive during sleep\n\nThose who sleep walk or sleep talk will know concretely that the brain is very much active at night.\n\nSome things that your brain is doing in the night is logging the memories of the day before, clearing out toxins, and moving the more important short-term memories into the part of the brain that stores long-term memories.\n\nOne study even found that you\u2019re able to make decisions in your sleep.\n\nYou swallow eight spiders per year while you sleep\n\nThis is probably the funniest one of all, and it\u2019s even funnier that 20% of people really believe that spiders are queuing up waiting for you to drift off and claim your mouth as their home.\n\nWhile we\u2019re awake or asleep, we\u2019re breathing and have a heartbeat, which creates vibrations alerting spiders of danger (at least the ones that live in the UK). The old adage is true that \u2018they\u2019re more scared of you than you are of them\u2019.\n\nSpider expert Dave Clarke told the BBC: \u2018Most predators won\u2019t tackle anything bigger than themselves because they are likely to come off worse\n\n\u2018Spiders are highly sensitive to both vibrations and heat so are unlikely to stumble across a human unawares. They are just not interested in us at all really.\u2019\n\nAnother flaw in the story includes the fact that there would really be no way to report having swallowed a spider in your sleep, given you\u2019d be asleep when it happened. Wouldn\u2019t it wake you while crawling on your face to get to the mouth?\n\nEssentially, while it\u2019s not impossible that someone might swallow a spider in their sleep, it\u2019s a pretty rare event, and not anything to keep you awake.\n\nMORE: How much sleep you need, and all your bedtime questions answered\n\nMORE: Sleeping for nine hours or more each night is linked to dementia\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "If you think a nightcap before you hit the hay is a good idea, you might just be wrong.
