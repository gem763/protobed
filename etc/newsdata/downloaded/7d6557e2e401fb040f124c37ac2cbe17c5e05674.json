He didn\u2019t practice this week while also dealing with an illness.\n\nAnderson hurt a shoulder last week at Philadelphia, and will likely miss a game for the first time since signing with the Jets before last season.\n\nLinebacker Jordan Jenkins (calf), cornerback Nate Hairston (knee) and wide receivers Demaryius Thomas (hamstring/knee) and Josh Bellamy (shoulder) are questionable.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The New York Jets are unlikely to have linebacker C.J.
