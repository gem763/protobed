He said he wasn\u2019t aware of any change in plans for Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to visit the White House in November.\n\nTrump has come under sharp criticism from Republican lawmakers, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, for stepping back from the Kurds. Graham called Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of northern Syria the \u201cbiggest blunder of his presidency.\u201d\n\nGraham said Friday that the White House action isn\u2019t \u201cappropriate for the threat we face,\u201d and the Trump administration needs to do more to protect Kurdish allies.\n\n\u201cThe conditional sanctions announced today will be viewed by Turkey as a tepid response and will embolden Erdogan even more,\u201d Graham said in a statement. \u201cThe Turkish government needs to know Congress will take a different path \u2013 passing crippling sanctions in a bipartisan fashion.\u201d\n\nTrump is signing an executive order allowing the U.S. to sanction individuals and entities in Turkey involved in human rights \u201cabuses or actions leading to the further deterioration of peace, security, and stability in northeastern Syria,\u201d according to the Treasury Department.\n\nTurkey\u2019s cross-border military offensive has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of \u201cterrorists\u201d since it began on Wednesday, according to Turkey\u2019s military.\n\nTrump defended his decision on withdrawing troops by saying the U.S. can\u2019t afford to be stuck in \u201cridiculous endless wars.\u201d\n\nSpecialists on sanctions said the administration already had the power to sanction Turkey and that the Friday announcement appeared to be a publicity stunt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only after Congress ordered the administration to put sanctions on Turkey they\u2019ve put in place a more specific mechanism to do so,\u201d said Daniel Tannebaum, a partner at Oliver Wyman in New York.\n\n(Updates with Graham comments beginning in the sixth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Josh Wingrove in Washington at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net;Saleha Mohsin in Washington at smohsin2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alex Wayne at awayne3@bloomberg.net, Joe Sobczyk, Justin Blum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump gave his administration authority to impose new sanctions on Turkey but isn\u2019t moving ahead with them yet, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\u201cWe are putting financial institutions on notice that they should be careful and that there could be sanctions,\u201d Mnuchin", "authors": ["Josh Wingrove", "Saleha Mohsin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3qJRiHgbHa7v7tm9PPDqYw--~B/aD0xMjQ5O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/21e136b7cc3cfe0b07c74d94f4a89653", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
