Photo: Courtesy of STX\n\nIn 1962, on the set of the beleaguered production of writer-director Joseph Mankiewicz\u2019s Cleopatra, Elizabeth Taylor gave Richard Burton a lesson on the power of a camera-lit star. As Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger write in Furious Love, Burton was initially confused by what he perceived to be Taylor\u2019s lack of technique. \u201cShe\u2019s just not doing anything,\u201d he complained to Mankiewicz of their scenes together. So the director took Burton aside and showed him what Taylor looked like onscreen. \u201cIt took his breath away,\u201d the authors write. \u201cBurton \u2014 trained to move, to speak, to act \u2014 was struck by Elizabeth\u2019s absolute stillness.\u201d Burton would later claim that he gleaned a lifelong skill from his time with Elizabeth: how to calmly acquiesce to the \u201ccamera\u2019s cool eye.\u201d\n\nIn Lorene Scafaria\u2019s glittering crime spectacle Hustlers, Jennifer Lopez barely needs to move before the camera\u2019s cool eye to pull our attention toward her. Consider her reintroduction onscreen, after she\u2019s just finished pole dancing to Fiona Apple\u2019s \u201cCriminal.\u201d She\u2019s festooned by a magnificent fur coat, wearing towering Lucite platform heels and a silver-tasseled number that highlights her immense beauty and fine musculature. She\u2019s on a roof, carefully smoking a cigarette while the night around her drenches the city. Lopez barely moves in this scene, but she doesn\u2019t have to. The confidence she possesses is undeniable, in the posture of her body and the jut of her chin. Destiny (Constance Wu) recognizes this immediately. She stumbles onto that rooftop and into a deep friendship that will alter the course of her life in ways she\u2019s still trying to understand by the end of the film. Lopez is a goddess and a general, a woman in full control of her body and the story it tells. And the body never lies. It\u2019s this fearsome, layered, magnetic performance that Hustlers orbits.\n\nHustlers, which is based on a New York Magazine article, is ostensibly about a group of 2007\u20132008\u2013era strippers, led by a woman named Ramona (Lopez), who begin drugging men with deep pockets after the financial crisis, maxing out their cards at the club and taking a cut for themselves. It\u2019s a raucous, glitter-coated treatise on the pulverizing nature of capitalism, stuffed inside a rich period piece whose soundtrack and costuming work in concert to create a bracing time capsule. The strippers\u2019 red-light-decked escapades are intercut with the individual story of Destiny, revealed through a series of prickly interactions with a journalist, Elizabeth (Julia Stiles, portraying New York\u2019s Jessica Pressler), who\u2019s interested in the scheme she hatched with Ramona. The strength of the film is in how it charts the fierce, complex, emotional relationship between these two women, as they alternately hustle to provide for their families and enjoy the luxury that the Wall Street suits they dance for take for granted.\n\nHustlers\u2019 profound vision of female friendship \u2014 physically intimate, occasionally uproarious, and always tangled up in power imbalances \u2014 dazzles in part because of the movie\u2019s casting. I was especially mesmerized by the small turns by Lili Reinhart as Annabelle, a stripper estranged from her family who tends to vomit under emotional duress, and Cardi B, whose signature cackle was made to be documented on film. Constance Wu brings a wounded, yearning quality to Destiny, apparent even before we learn of her mother\u2019s abandonment, casting in sharp relief why she\u2019s so drawn to Ramona. Beyond the cast, Scafaria proves to be an immensely intelligent writer-director, who never looks down on her characters, allowing them to be rough-hewn anti-heroes rather than bland paragons of empowerment. Scafaria wisely revels in the hard-edged nature of women, allowing them to be angry, untrusting, vindictive, loving, and glamorous, all at the same time. In essence, they have humanity.\n\nMuch can be said about the aesthetic delights of the film, too. The film deftly glides through time, owing to editor Kayla Emter, who balances the emotional, criminal, and cultural threads of the film. Mitchell Travers\u2019s wardrobe design is some of the best I\u2019ve seen this year; the second-skin tight dresses, silver thigh-high boots, chinchilla coats, and Juicy Couture hoodies feel totemic. The sound design and music supervision are stealthily beguiling. At one point, Destiny abruptly turns off Elizabeth\u2019s recording device, ending the interview and plunging the film into silence. It\u2019s a cunning choice.\n\nBut days later, I keep coming back to Jennifer Lopez\u2019s performance. With a wave of her hand or a dip in her hips, light seems to change and move with her. Lopez has always been charming \u2014 even great \u2014 in films like Out of Sight (1998). But here she\u2019s doing the best work of her career, weaponizing an undeniable charisma and turning it into something hard, pointed, righteous, even angry. The way she trains her Kohl-rimmed eyes on a mark is thrilling and frightening. The way she walks into a room \u2014 and the film gives us ample opportunity to study her strut in fur, into a bar, toward a salivating man, sometimes in slow motion \u2014 communicates such self-possession and raw grace that I found myself craning closer to the screen, as if I could identify the source of such power and adopt it myself. There\u2019s a moment late in the film when we only see Lopez\u2019s back to the camera, dressed in that Juicy Couture hoodie and leather leggings. Scafaria\u2019s camera holds onto this image. We can\u2019t see Lopez\u2019s face, but her still back paints a picture of confidence, hard work, desire. It\u2019s a fleeting moment but one that stopped me cold, in awe of the story her body had to tell.", "description": "Lorene Scafaria\u2019s glittering crime spectacle \u201cHustlers\u201d revolves around Jennifer Lopez\u2019s magnetic performance.", "authors": ["Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-hustler-review-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
