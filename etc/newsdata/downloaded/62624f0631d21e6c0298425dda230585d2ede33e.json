REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead its planned initial public offering (IPO), slated to be the world\u2019s largest, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nThe mandates have been heavily sought by the world\u2019s largest investment banks for a transaction which, according to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s initial plans, could generate around $100 billion (80.93 billion pounds) for Saudi Arabia\u2019s state coffers.\n\nThe kingdom plans to list 1% of the state oil giant on the Riyadh stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020, sources told Reuters this week, as initial steps ahead of a public sale of around 5% of Aramco.\n\nAramco has selected JPMorgan (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Saudi Arabia\u2019s National Commercial Bank (1180.SE), which were previously working on the share sale before it was paused last year, the sources said, declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities.\n\nIt has also chosen Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Citi (C.N), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Samba (1090.SE), they added.\n\nJPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment. Aramco and the remaining banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe IPO plan has rapidly gained momentum in recent days with the appointment of the head of the kingdom\u2019s PIF sovereign wealth fund, Yasser al-Rumayyan, as Aramco\u2019s new chairman.\n\nBankers have been courting Saudi Arabia to secure roles in the transaction, which has faced repeated delays, but which officials have said will happen by 2020-2021.\n\nAramco\u2019s chief executive, Amin Nasser, said this week that the domestic IPO would be the \u201cprimary\u201d listing but that the company was also ready for an international share sale. He said the final decision on venue and timing rested with the government.", "description": "Saudi Aramco has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead its planned initial public offering (IPO), slated to be the world's largest, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Hadeel Al Sayegh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428687819&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A10G", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
