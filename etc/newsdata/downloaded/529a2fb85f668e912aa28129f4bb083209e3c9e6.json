A new study casts doubt on this, however, arguing that Beijing doesn\u2019t have the military power to defeat its neighbors. In fact, it probably can\u2019t even conquer Taiwan.\n\nThe new study by Michael Beckley, an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Tufts University, was published in the academic journal International Security. In the article, Beckley argues that China\u2019s neighbors could thwart Chinese military aggression through anti-access/area denial strategies with only minimal U.S. assistance.\n\n\u201cMy main finding is that there is a budding balance of military power in East Asia, which the United States can reinforce at moderate risk to U.S. forces,\u201d Beckley writes in the article. \u201cFurthermore, this balance of power will remain stable for years to come, because China cannot afford the power-projection capabilities it would need to overcome the A2/AD forces of its neighbors. The main reasons are that power projection forces are more expensive than A2/AD forces by an order of magnitude.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "More than America would keep the PLA at bay.", "authors": ["Zachary Keck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T3Gdd9xFjGxbMMVmWI0Vmw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/58eae979a16b55a6518c019bcd0d4866", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
