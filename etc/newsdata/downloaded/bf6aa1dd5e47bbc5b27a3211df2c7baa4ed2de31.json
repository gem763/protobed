It means they might have to make compromises around which things they go to, how long they spend at incidents. I think communities may notice that.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s our ability to deal with street-based violence, whether it\u2019s our ability to investigate things like domestic abuse, or any other crime you care to mention, there will be a cost.\u201d\n\nFrontline officers have been pulled off their normal shifts to tackle protests 83,000 times so far this financial year, compared to the 80,000 \u201cabstracted\u201d to respond to the 2017 London terror attacks and Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nAs well as using its own officers, Scotland Yard is to use \u201cmutual aid\u201d arrangements to drawn on specialists from other police forces, including those trained to remove demonstrators who attach themselves to roads and objects.\n\nFollowing accusations Scotland Yard was too slow to react to Extinction Rebellion\u2019s London protests in April, which saw the group block Waterloo Bridge and Piccadilly Circus, Mr Ephgrave said the force \u201cwants to be ahead of what\u2019s happening rather than responding to it\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will police this within the law, fairly but firmly,\u201d he added. \u201cOur intention is that London stays open for business throughout this period and we will take whatever measures we can to make that happen.\u201d\n\nMr Ephgrave said Extinction Rebellion had not been classified as an extremist group but would not confirm or deny whether police are spying on protesters using sources or undercover officers.\n\nOfficers have met with organisers of next week\u2019s protests, which are planned for 12 locations in London including Trafalgar Square and outside Downing Street and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said former police officers had joined its protests and \u201cmany are prepared to risk their liberty to stand up for the planet\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the humanity of the government and authorities to remember that we are non-violent protestors,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to their humanity to remember that we are facing an unprecedented global emergency. Many are losing their lives already and we are called upon as human beings to act now.\u201d", "description": "Police are seeking new legal powers against protesters after Extinction Rebellion demonstrators brought parts of London to a standstill.
