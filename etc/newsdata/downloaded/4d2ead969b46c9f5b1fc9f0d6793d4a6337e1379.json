Since garlic chips can burn easily, the key here is to combine the garlic and oil in an unheated pan for even cooking. As the oil heats up, the garlic will sizzle rapidly as the moisture cooks off. When it slows down, the garlic slices should be crisp. Be sure to remove the chips just as they begin to turn golden, as they will continue to cook after being removed from the oil. The rest is easy: Saut\u00e9 the eggplant, create a quick soy sauce glaze, sprinkle with herbs and garlic chips, and serve.", "description": "This vibrant eggplant dish relies heavily on simple pantry staples, but gets its complex flavor from the clever use of garlic: First, you make garlic chips, then you fry eggplant in the remaining garlic-infused oil Since garlic chips can burn easily, the key here is to combine the garlic and oil in an unheated pan for even cooking As the oil heats up, the garlic will sizzle rapidly as the moisture cooks off", "authors": ["Sue Li", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Trish Hall", "Florence Fabricant", "Pierre Franey", "Tejal Rao", "Lidey Heuck", "Nigella Lawson", "Sam Sifton", "Alison Roman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/dining/sl-eggplant-and-garlic/sl-eggplant-and-garlic-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
