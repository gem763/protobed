Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\n....and separately got 1.5 Billion Dollars from China despite no experience and for no apparent reason. There is NO WAY these can be legitimate transactions? As lawyers & others have stated, as President, I have an OBLIGATION to look into possible, or probable, CORRUPTION! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\nThe Biden family was PAID OFF, pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company, and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter..... \u2014 Donald J.

I wouldn\u2019t want him dealing with China & U! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\nDemocrats launched an impeachment into Trump over a call he had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, Trump asked Zelensky to look into the Bidens' dealings. While Vice President Joe Biden was handling foreign relations with Ukraine on behalf of the United States, his son, Hunter, was being paid $50,000 a month by a Ukrainian oil company, despite having no natural energy experience. Democrats have said Trump threatened to withhold military aid unless Zelensky launched a probe but an unclassified, unredacted transcript of the call shows that to be false.", "description": "Boom..10/06/2019 20:07:15PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/154/43370335-e701-4099-b3e4-f01b66d4d7b8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
