She's good people, she's an amazing person and we're just keeping it friendly.\"\n\nCameron was a popular choice to become \"The Bachelor\" after he failed to win Hannah Brown's heart, though the two had been hanging out after she split with winner Jed Wyatt over his having a girlfriend back home.\n\nBut there was a question as to whether or not he's free to do the show or date Brown -- given that he looked to be otherwise occupied with Hadid.\n\nCameron wasn't much interested in spilling the tea.\n\n\"I'm at the point where I don't really want to talk about my relationships,\" he said. \"I've dated publicly, so ... I'm trying to date privately and I'm not in love with anybody right now.\"\n\n\"I'm in love with myself,\" he added.\n\nHe was, however, more keen to talk about relocating from Florida to New York City to pursue modeling. He said he hopes to use any profits to fund some real estate projects back in his home state.\n\n\"I'm so new to (the modeling) world and that industry,\" he said. \"I'm just having fun with it and making a name of myself if I can.\"", "description": "Tyler Cameron thinks Gigi Hadid is \"good people.\"", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925090905-tyler-cameron-gigi-hadid-split-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
