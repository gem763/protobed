Photograph: Stella Creasy/PA\n\nFootage posted on Facebook by the activists showed the moment when one of the council officers read out a community protection notice obliging them to remove the poster. He was heard saying the council would use bylaws, applying to the town square, which prohibited the banner from being there.\n\nOn Monday, someone covered part of the billboard, which was also part of the campaign against Creasy, with white paint.\n\nClare Coghill, the leader of Waltham Forest council, said the authority had received numerous complaints from members of the public about the campaign and \u201chad responded proportionately, having due regard to the right to protest and safety and wellbeing of all our residents and visitors\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe fundamentally believe in free speech and the right to protest. Both are vital in a healthy democracy.\n\n\u201cHowever, residents and visitors to our town centre also have the fundamental right to use the town centre without being confronted with distressing images.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Scotland Yard said: \u201cPolice initially attended the protest on Saturday 28 September and listened to concerns about the content of parts of the protest, but at that point considered no criminal offences were committed or disclosed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe MPS subsequently received a complaint about the protest and the billboard resulting in a review of the initial MPS position and as a result we are currently scoping to establish whether any criminal offences have occurred.\u201d", "description": "Activists forced to take down poster in MP\u2019s Walthamstow seat showing aborted foetus", "authors": ["Ben Quinn", "Andrew Rawnsley", "Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/295d7eb9ad467f1b8267910afed54d83b5db18d6/0_1653_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42b20ac874201a12d672dc84a747e0cc"}
