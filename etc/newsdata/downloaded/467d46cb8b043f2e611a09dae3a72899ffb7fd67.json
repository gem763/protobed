The King married her in 1795 in exchange for Parliament paying his debts\n\nAmong the personal documents available to see at georgianpapers.com is a four-page note the prince wrote to his new wife Princess Caroline of Brunswick just 17 days after their wedding, already pointing to problems in their marriage.\n\nHe tackled his bride over the issue of treating ladies of the court equally, and also expressed his regret that etiquette prevented Caroline's life from being 'more gay & amusing', and stated that 'if you wish for more of my company it must strike you that the natural mode of obtaining it is to make my own house not obnoxious to me'.\n\nA year later, he wrote of how they had come to terms with their incompatibility, saying 'we have unfortunately been oblig'd to acknowledge to each other that we cannot find happiness in our union'.\n\nGeorge IV hated Princess Caroline (in the portrait above). He banned her from his coronation and wrote a will which would have left her with one shilling and given Maria Fitzherbert, a Roman Catholic he had secretly married, the rest\n\n'Circumstances of character & education, \u2026 render that impossible,' he continued.\n\nThe prince, whose extravagant lifestyle caused his father George III to regard him with contempt, married Princess Caroline in 1795 in exchange for Parliament paying his debts.\n\nHe had already secretly and illegally wed a Roman Catholic, Maria Fitzherbert and had many mistresses.\n\nHe hated his wife, banned her from his coronation and wrote a will which would have left her with one shilling and given Fitzherbert the rest.\n\nThe couple lived together for about a year before George sought a separation. He tried unsuccessfully to divorce her after his accession.\n\nOther papers look at the Regency crisis of 1788-9, with George, during his father's illness, writing letters arguing against prime minister William Pitt's proposal for a limited Regency, which would have left the king's Household under the authority of the queen.\n\nThe prince argued it would be a 'project for producing weakness, disorder and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs'.\n\nFor the last nine years of his life, George III was declared mentally unfit to rule, and his son acted as Prince Regent.\n\nThe Georgian Papers Programme is digitising, conserving and cataloguing nearly half a million pages from the Royal Archives and Royal Library relating to the Georgian period.\n\nThe partnership between the Royal Collection Trust, King's College London and US institutions such as the Library of Congress gives the public access to material which brings the day-to-day life of the royal court alive.\n\nMore than 125,000 documents and letters are available to see free online so far.", "description": "The letters, published online for the first time, reveal his obsession with Mary Hamilton, who was six years his senior.
