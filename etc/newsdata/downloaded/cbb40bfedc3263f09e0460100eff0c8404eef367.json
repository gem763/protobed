That process, which requires executives to commit to hitting financial targets embedded in multiyear plans, ignited a shake-up among the bank's long-time managers, said the person.\n\nPartners sit atop the hierarchy at Goldman Sachs, the only bank among the biggest U.S. firms to still use the term. It's a throwback to when Goldman was a private partnership, meaning that partners committed their own money and reaped a percentage of the bank's profits.\n\nEven though that arrangement ended with the bank's 1999 IPO, partners are still the best paid at Goldman: They make at least $1 million in annual compensation, and often several times that much. They also have access to investment vehicles off-limits to other employees and attend exclusive networking events.\n\nThe group of about 450 partners has swollen in recent years, and Solomon's moves are seen as making the title more exclusive. It also will trim costs as the bank undertakes several expensive initiatives, including a push into consumer lending and wealth management for the masses.", "description": "The move comes as Solomon is pushing ahead on an internal review of the firm's businesses.", "authors": ["Hugh Son"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106114173-1567703007328gettyimages-1140232159.jpeg?v=1567703047", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
