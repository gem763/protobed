About 25% of high school seniors reported recent e-cigarette use in a health survey this year, up from 11% in 2017. About 12% of students said this year that they used the products on a daily basis.\n\nOfficials have largely blamed that surge on Juul, which dominates the US market. As youth vaping skyrocketed between 2017 and 2018, Juul saw its sales rise 783%. Federal regulators and lawmakers have accused the company of making unsubstantiated claims about the safety of its products and directly marketing them to teens.\n\nIn September, the Trump administration announced that it planned to ban all flavored products to address what the Food and Drug Administration has called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of youth vaping.\n\nShortly after, Juul announced that its CEO was stepping down and that it was ceasing all US advertising and lobbying.\n\nIn today\u2019s announcement, Juul\u2019s new CEO K.C. Crosthwaite said, \u201cWe must reset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to combat underage use while providing an alternative to adult smokers.\u201d\n\nPrior to taking the position at Juul, Crosthwaite was the \u201cChief Growth Officer\u201d at Altria Group Inc., formerly Philip Morris Companies Inc.\n\nA sticking point for Juul\u2019s latest move to \u201ccombat underage use\u201d is that the banned flavors are not the ones teens are using most often\u2014the remaining flavors, mint and menthol, are.\n\nAccording to federal data, of all the high schoolers who used e-cigarettes between 2017 and 2018, nearly 68% reported using flavoring of any kind. But in the same batch of high school vapers, a little over 51% said they used mint and menthol products.\n\nThat\u2019s why in September, federal officials made a point to note that they would seek to ban mint and menthol flavors as well as fruity and dessert flavors.\n\nThe data \u201cshows that the youth are drawn to flavored e-cigarettes, including mint and menthol,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in an Oval Office meeting at the time.\n\nThe plan prompted some e-cigarette companies to look into legal challenges to such a ban, according to The New York Times. But in today\u2019s announcement, Juul said it \u201cwill fully support and comply with the final policy when effective.\u201d", "description": "The move hints at a battle over mint and menthol products.", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-566014607-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
