He also threw to the Falcons receivers some. During his time being around the Falcons, he became a star quarterback at Gainesville High School in Georgia.\n\nESPN.com\u2019s Sarah Barshop wrote about Watson\u2019s experience as one of the Falcons\u2019 ball boys before Watson\u2019s Houston Texans take on the Falcons this Sunday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nAnd Barshop got Watson to share a doozy of a story about former Falcons cornerback Asante Samuel.\n\nDeshaun Watson got a nice tip from Asante Samuel\n\nWatson told Barshop that one day during practice, Samuel was doing a special-teams drill when he realized he forgot his mouthpiece in his locker. Samuel, a four-time Pro Bowler who spent his final two seasons with Atlanta, asked Watson to go get it for him. That was the type of thing ball boys would do. Samuel told Watson to see him after practice.\n\n\u201cSo I went to his locker after practice, and he pulled out his Louis [Vuitton] bag and pulled out a whole stack of money, and he gave me like $1,000, just to go get his mouthpiece,\u201d Watson said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to give me anything, but he did.\u201d\n\nWatson said that was a lesson for him in how to treat people. Watson has carried that on. Even as a rookie there were heartwarming stories about him treating everyone in the Texans organization well.\n\nWatson\u2019s time as a ball boy benefited him\n\nStory continues\n\nWatson started as a ball boy at age 14, and the Falcons asked him back every year Watson was in high school. Not only was it working with the team in training camp, but Barshop wrote the ball boys were allowed on the sideline and in the locker room on game days.\n\nWatson said being around an NFL team growing up helped him immensely. He told Barshop the experience \u201ctaught me how to really work.\u201d\n\nThere are also tales of Watson being nervous throwing to star receivers like Roddy White, though those nerves dissipated over time. Julio Jones said he knew Watson was going to be a good quarterback and \u201cI tried to get him to go to Alabama.\u201d Watson went to Clemson, and he beat Alabama in the national championship game.\n\nWho knows? Maybe there\u2019s a ball boy on an NFL team that is honing his craft and becoming the next Deshaun Watson.\n\n\u201cI always think about it,\u201d Watson told ESPN. \u201cThat\u2019s something that helped change my life.\u201d\n\nDeshaun Watson has become one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.
