This is good news for the Islamic State, which can mount its comeback more effectively if the Kurds are distracted. It is also good news for the Islamic Republic of Iran, which wants to turn Syria into a base for attacking Israel, something that will now be a lot easier.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision came out of the blue last night, in the form of a brief announcement from the office of the White House press secretary. Top national security officials had been working for months on an agreement with Turkey to prevent it from attacking the Kurds. That agreement appears to be dead.\n\nThe White House said Trump\u2019s decision came after a phone call with Erdogan earlier on Sunday. This is actually the second time Trump has attempted a sudden reversal of his Syria policy after a phone call with Erdogan. Last December, the president said he was going to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria \u2014 they numbered about 2,000 at the time \u2014 and let Turkish forces deal with any remaining problems caused by the Islamic State.\n\nJUDITH MILLER: TRUMP'S SYRIA MOVE ALL WRONG \u2014 IT JEOPARDIZES COSTLY VICTORY OVER ISIS, BETRAYS THE KURDS\n\nThat December reversal led Secretary of Defense James Mattis to resign in protest. Meanwhile, 42 Senate Republicans voted with 26 Democrats to condemn any \u201cprecipitous withdrawal\u201d prior to the \u201cenduring defeat\u201d of ISIS. Slowly and quietly, Trump started to back away from his decision, although he never said he had changed his mind.\n\nOne reason that so many conservatives united against Trump\u2019s decision is they understood that Erdogan is an adversary of the United States, even though Turkey remains part of NATO. Under previous leaders, Turkey had been a real ally. But Erdogan is an Islamist who has a long record of protecting extremists and terrorists, including members of Hamas directly responsible for murdering Israelis. Not surprisingly, the Turkish president is also a vicious anti-Semite who blames Jewish conspiracies for the economic chaos his own policies have created.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nInfluential figures close to Erdogan also partnered with Iran to evade U.S. sanctions, helping the Islamic Republic to tap $20 billion of frozen income \u2014 the full details emerged in the federal trial of a Turkish banker in 2017.\n\nWith regard to Syria in particular, Erdogan has a long record of sending money and weapons to extremist rebels, including those tied to Al Qaeda. Turkish intelligence even helped deliver the goods across the border. Just last month, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on several Turkey-based financiers and currency exchanges for supporting the Islamic State.\n\nEven so, yesterday\u2019s announcement from the White House said, \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d In other words, Trump is putting an arsonist in charge of putting out the fire.\n\nConservatives who opposed Trump\u2019s planned withdrawal last December also understood that the president was dead wrong when he claimed that ISIS had been defeated. It was true that the U.S.-led coalition had put an end to the Islamic State\u2019s ability to govern the territory it called the \"caliphate.\" However, it was clear that ISIS was already shifting to an insurgency based on guerrilla warfare. That insurgency has gotten progressively stronger over the past 10 months, yet Trump refuses to acknowledge the difference between dismantling the caliphate and defeating ISIS. Yesterday, he justified his latest reversal on Syria by insisting, \u201cWe quickly defeated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate.\u201d\n\nSome high-profile Trump supporters are already speaking out against the president\u2019s decision. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley tweeted, \u201cThe Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News that Trump was making exactly the same mistake that Obama made in Iraq, which led to the rise of ISIS. \u201cThis is a big win for Iran and Assad,\u201d Graham added, \"a big win for ISIS.\"\n\nTrump is clearly sensitive to the suggestion he is betraying the Kurds. Within hours of Haley and Graham\u2019s comments, Trump pledged that if Turkey did anything \u201coff limits\u201d in Syria, he would \u201cdestroy and obliterate\u201d its economy. Trump\u2019s threat is not entirely credible, however, since he was not willing to sanction Turkey when it directly defied a U.S. warning not to purchase advanced air defense weapons from Russia. Nor has Trump fined the Turkish bank that helped Iran evade U.S. sanctions, despite the conviction of the bank\u2019s general manager.\n\nIf Trump were serious about preventing Turkey from slaughtering the Syrian Kurds, he would have supported the State Department\u2019s efforts to negotiate a border security agreement, rather than giving Erdogan a green light to invade. But mistakes like this are to be expected when the president makes impulsive decisions rather than thinking things through with the help of his top advisers. As Fox News reported this morning, Trump\u2019s decision completely blindsided the Department of Defense.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe only good news when it comes to Syria is that the president still has time to reverse his decision. While U.S. troops appear to have already left certain observation posts near the Syrian border with Turkey, they can return. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should quickly tell the Turkish leader that his invitation to the White House in November will be canceled if Turkey launches an attack on the Kurds.\n\nTrump says he wants to put an end to America\u2019s endless wars, an idea that is popular on both sides of the aisle. What the president does not seem to understand is that we have avoided an endless war in Syria by finding allies \u2014 including Arabs and Christians, as well as Kurds \u2014 who did the hardest and bloodiest fighting. By supporting our partners with air power, intelligence, and a small contingent of troops, the U.S. military has been achieving a key victory at a very low cost in American dollars and American lives. A wiser president would take credit for this achievement instead of undermining it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAVID ADESNIK", "description": "The only good news when it comes to Syria is that the president still has time to reverse his decision.", "authors": ["David Adesnik"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/07/694940094001_6093007255001_6093004294001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
