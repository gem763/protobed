Our predicted Ballon d'Or shortlist 1/31 Our predicted Ballon d'Or shortlist The Ballon d'Or shortlist is announced this evening. Here are the 30 players we are tipping to make the shortlist. Reuters 2/31 30. Robertson It\u2019s been an incredible year for Robertson, who seems to get better and better with each game. Remarkably, he cost Liverpool just \u00a38m from Hull in 2017. Now he is arguably the best left-back in Europe. AFP via Getty Images 3/31 29. Kimmich Exceptional whether playing at right-back or in midfield, Kimmich is now undoubtedly amongst Bayern\u2019s most important players. It\u2019s easy to forget that he\u2019s still just 24. He plays with the maturity and intelligence of someone who\u2019s been at the top of his game for years. Getty Images 4/31 28. Neymar Has been on the receiving end of some criticism over the last year and hasn\u2019t played as regularly as he would\u2019ve liked. But when he has been on the pitch for PSG, the Brazilian remains unstoppable. The Ballon d\u2019Or is likely to remain elusive for another year, though. REUTERS 5/31 27. Chiellini As dominant and rugged in defence as ever at 35-years-old. Chiellini guided Juventus to yet another Serie A title last season, keeping a host of clean sheets along the way. Action Images via Reuters 6/31 26. Reus After a couple of frustrating, injury-plagued years, Reus returned to the top of his game for Borussia Dortmund last season, scoring 21 goals as Lucian Favre\u2019s side ran eventual Bundesliga champions Bayern close. REUTERS 7/31 25. Pjanic The metronome in midfield for Juventus, Pjanic often goes under the radar but has been an integral part of the Bianconeri\u2019s recent success. Few midfielders in world football have a better range of passing. REUTERS 8/31 24. Koulibaly A rock at the back for Napoli and one of Europe\u2019s most well-rounded defenders. Has been repeatedly linked with big money moves to the likes of Barcelona and Manchester United. REUTERS 9/31 23. Suarez There have been suggestions that Suarez, now 32-years-old, is past his best, but he remains unerringly prolific. He scored 25 goals in all competitions last season as Barcelona secured another La Liga title. Getty Images 10/31 22. Griezmann As consistent as ever for Atletico Madrid before his summer move to Barcelona, where he has started the season impressively, scoring four goals and providing three assists in eight La Liga appearances. Getty Images 11/31 21. Di Maria Established himself as a key player for Paris Saint-Germain since joining the club from Manchester United in 2015. Has been a standout performer for the Ligue 1 champions over the last year, and could be the man to guide them to a long-awaited success in the Champions League. Icon Sport via Getty Images 12/31 20. Modric The reigning Ballon d'Or holder is still oozing class, yet he's certainly on the other side of the mountain now, yet still capable of shining at the highest level. CameraSport via Getty Images 13/31 19. Arthur Established at the Nou Camp and integrated into the Brazil side, where he played a key role in the Copa America triumph. Presents a scarily good midfield for the future in Barcelona alongside Frenkie De Jong. Getty Images 14/31 18. Kane Often dismissed yet his record remains superb, operating at the heart of Spurs and England in their excellent Champions League and Nations League runs. Continues to quietly put together a world class resume, even if many will refuse to acknowledge it until he's gone. Getty Images 15/31 17. De Ligt A dominant centre-back with quality to match, though the transition at Juventus has so far been tough. Yet he led a young Ajax team superbly and forms one half of the finest centre-back partnership in international football alongside Virgil van Dijk. Getty Images 16/31 16. De Bruyne Injuries have stemmed his progress, but he is back now and hitting his previous heights. A devastating player able to break games open or control them. PA 17/31 15. Lewandowski Still maintaining a relentless goalscoring streak at 31 years old and thriving in a leadership role in a Bayern side in transition. Perhaps Europe's most prolific striker and capable of scoring every type of goal. AFP via Getty Images 18/31 14. Mbappe The magnetism of Mbappe hasn't faded since France's World Cup victory, scoring 33 goals in 29 games as PSG stormed to the Ligue 1 title. Icon Sport via Getty Images 19/31 13. Kante Running ceaselessly across the midfield in a box-to-box role, offering a new vein of attacking threat under Maurizio Sarri, Kante again proved why he's the best midfielder of his ilk as Chelsea won the Europa League. REUTERS 20/31 12. Firmino Selfless at times but also key in sprinkling the final touches to Liverpool's moves when necessary. Gorgeous technique and the movement to enable Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah to thrive. Getty Images 21/31 11. Tadic Shining as a false nine and delivering insane production for Dutch giants Ajax. Maybe the key piece in their Champions League run, 47 goals and 34 assists since the start of last season. Getty Images 22/31 10. De Jong Maybe the finest midfielder of the last 12 months, fearless on the ball for Ajax, no matter the moment, while also fundamental to a resurgent Netherlands. Barcelona have the premier midfielder of the next decade. AP 23/31 9. Hazard In a topsy-turvy final season at Chelsea, under Maurizio Sarri, Hazard carried an often chaotic side on his shoulders, scoring 21 goals and adding 17 assists in all competitions as the Blues won the Europa League, before finally sealing his summer move to Real Madrid. Getty Images 24/31 8. Alisson The Brazilian established himself as arguably the best ball-playing goalkeeper in the world, making a series of crucial saves - none more so than against Napoli - as Liverpool clinched a sixth European Cup. Getty Images 25/31 7. Salah Relentlessly effective cutting in off the right-wing, Salah scored 27 goals in all competitions as Liverpool lifted the Champions League and chased down Man City to the final game of the Premier League season. Liverpool FC via Getty Images 26/31 6. Sterling Man City's standout player in the absence of Kevin De Bruyne, scoring 17 goals and adding 12 assists as Pep Guardiola's side clinched a third Premier League title, as well as an FA and EFL Cup. AFP via Getty Images 27/31 5. Bernardo Silva Integral to Manchester City, having helped fill the void left by the injured Kevin De Bruyne, while also an inspiration for Portugal to win the Nations League. A complete player who refuses to hide in the big moments and always makes his teammates better. Getty Images 28/31 4. Mane The understated partner to Mohamed Salah, yet quietly the more impressive over the 2018/19 season. Mane scored 22 goals in the Premier League, starred in Liverpool's Champions League win, and guided Senegal to the final of the African Cup of Nations. Getty Images 29/31 3. Ronaldo The fears over whether Ronaldo's talents would fade beyond Madrid were quickly extinguished, scoring 21 goals in 31 games as Juventus cantered to the Serie A title, before inspiring Portugal's Nations League victory in the summer. Juventus FC via Getty Images 30/31 2. Van Dijk The undisputed talisman of Liverpool's Champions League win, and the club's relentless title charge. The centre-back played every league game and lifted a formidable side like no few other players in Europe have managed. Getty Images 31/31 1. Messi As mercurial and peerless as ever, Messi scored 36 goals and added 15 assists as Barcelona clinched La Liga, as well as 12 goals in 10 games during the club's run to the Champions League semi-final.

EPA\n\nThe study - titled 'Football's Influence on Lifelong Health and Dementia Risk' or FIELD for short - found that deaths in ex-footballers were lower than expected up to age 70, and higher than expected over that age.\n\nDr Stewart said in a statement: \"An important aspect of this work has been the ability to look across a range of health outcomes in former professional footballers. This allows us to build a more complete picture of health in this population.\n\n\"Our data show that while former footballers had higher dementia rates, they had lower rates of death due to other major diseases.\n\n\"As such, whilst every effort must be made to identify the factors contributing to the increased risk of neurodegenerative disease to allow this risk to be reduced, there are also wider potential health benefits of playing football to be considered.\"\n\nThe findings come 17 years since the death of former England and West Brom striker Jeff Astle with what a coroner described as an \"industrial injury\".\n\nSince Astle's death, the families of dozens of other ex-footballers, including several from England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad, have come forward to reveal their stories of dealing with dementia and related illnesses.\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke said: \"The whole game must recognise that this is only the start of our understanding and there are many questions that still need to be answered.\n\n\"It is important that the global football family now unites to find the answers and provide a greater understanding of this complex issue. The FA is committed to doing all it can to make that happen.\"\n\nPFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said it was \"incumbent on football globally to come together to address this issue in a comprehensive and united manner\".\n\nHe added: \"Research must continue to answer more specific questions about what needs to be done to identify and reduce risk factors.\"\n\nIt is not clear from the study what the exact causes of the increased rates of dementia are.\n\nThe FA said in a statement: \"The study does not determine whether the cause is due to concussions suffered by the group of professional footballers, or concussion management, or heading of the football, or style of play, or the design and composition of footballs over the years, or personal lifestyle, or some other factor.\"\n\nThe governing body said the study's findings had been reviewed by an independent Medical and Football Advisory Group, which recommended re-issuing the current FA concussion guidelines and best-practice advice for coaching heading and called for further steps to improve head injury management, like supporting UEFA's proposals to introduce concussion substitutes.\n\nThe group said more research was needed and there was \"not enough evidence at this stage to make other changes to the way the modern-day game is played\".\n\nThe FA said it was not important to try and establish \"whether or not the results from this historic group of former professional footballers relates, in any way, to the modern-day professional footballer\".\n\nIt said it had written to FIFA and UEFA to offer its full support on future research in this area as well as share the findings of the study with them.\n\nPA Sport contributed to this report", "description": "A new study has found former footballers are three and a half times more at risk than the general population to die of neurodegenerative disease. A report commissioned by The FA and PFA\u00a0was released on Monday after an analysis took place on\u00a0the medical records of 7,676 men who played professionally in\u00a0Scotland from 1900 to 1976.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/21/13/gettyimages-1152480626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
