U.S. stores aren\u2019t following suit, yet.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s MCD, +0.04% has said it will allow parents to swap Happy Meal toys for a bag of fruit in selected U.K. stores. In early 2020, the chain will also run a trial offering customers a choice between a book and a plastic toy.\n\nA Change.org petition, calling on Burger King, owned by Restaurant Brands International QSR, +0.78% , and McDonald\u2019s to \u201cthink of the environment and stop giving plastic toys with their kids meals,\u201d has attracted half a million signatures.\n\nBurger King U.K. CEO Alasdair Murdoch told the Telegraph: \u201cWe\u2019re making a start. This is a step in the right direction. If it makes other competitors move their practices forward, that can only be a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant estimates the toy ban will save 320 metric tons of plastic waste a year, it told the Independent.\n\nThe policy changes come in the days leading up to the much-publicized United Nations \u201cclimate crisis\u201d meeting in New York on Sept. 23. That gathering has encouraged a flurry of activism, including another walkout on Friday by students and workers at companies, Amazon AMZN, +0.22% among them, to bring attention to the climate issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook FB, +1.06% will ban single-use plastic water bottles at all of its new offices worldwide, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nThe social-media giant will install water-filling stations at those locations in the San Francisco Bay area, as well as at new offices in Los Angeles, Chicago and Austin, Texas. The company\u2019s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters is also being retrofitted with filling stations, with the goal of cutting local plastic-bottle usage in half.\n\nThe ban appears to be the largest among private employers, the Chronicle said. Facebook had nearly 40,000 employees as of June.\n\nEarlier this summer, San Francisco International Airport, one of the largest in the country, said it would ban the sale of single-use plastic water bottles, a move that the airport has claimed is the first such change for its type of facility. Flavored water sold in bottles will be an exception, and the airport has installed more than 100 free water-bottle-filling stations.\n\nSeveral companies across a range of industries, including Starbucks SBUX, +0.66% , Disney DIS, -2.56% , American Airlines AAL, -1.05% and Marriott International MAR, -0.49% , have planned plastic straws. It\u2019s been a policy change not without issue; for one thing, recycling centers are challenged to process thicker paper straw alternatives that are getting stuck in the machinery.\n\nRead: Team Trump rakes in $200,000 in one weekend through the sale of plastic straws \u2014 buy a pack to \u2018own the libs\u2019", "description": "At least three more major companies are rethinking plastic.", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR684_mcd_ha_ZG_20190919162224.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
