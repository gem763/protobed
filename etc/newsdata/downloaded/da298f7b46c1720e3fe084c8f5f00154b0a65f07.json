These moves by Trump are things that go against not just whatever the current Democratic leaders in Sacramento are doing, but against the way that Republicans and Democrats have been seeking to do things for years.\u201d\n\nBruce Cain, a political-science professor at Stanford University and a longtime student of the state, notes that Trump\u2019s brand of anti-Californianism is different from, and starker than, that of 50 years ago. \u201cVersion one of California-bashing was against white, liberal, middle-class, hippie-dippie countercultural kids,\u201d Cain told me. \u201cStarting with Reagan and his picking on kids at the University of California.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s attack is less humorous and, I think, darker and more sinister,\u201d Cain adds. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to talk about terrorists coming up with Central American refugees, and has really taken the fear of violence against persons and fear of terrorism to a new level.\u201d\n\nCain says that\u2019s dangerous for Trump: \u201cInside his own party, he\u2019s continuing to put pressure on the well-educated suburban women who enjoy their tax cuts and regulatory relief and the fact that they don\u2019t have a Democrat in the White House, but are really squirming more and more over the racialized aspect of his criticism. And they have the example, particularly here in California, that this is long-term harmful to the party.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s broadsides also ignore the reality that however much he might try to paint California as an overregulated, antibusiness crucible of failed liberal economic policies, it has nevertheless managed to spawn Tesla, Uber, Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Netflix, and Oracle. It is still, as it has been for decades, the place where the future so often begins.\n\nAt the same time, there is no doubt that the state has grave problems. It has 12 percent of the country\u2019s population, but half of its homeless people. A yawning gap between rich and poor\u2014and, perversely, a generally robust economy\u2014has produced skyrocketing housing prices and a resulting shortage of homes, and strict building, zoning, and environmental codes often impede the kind of quick construction that might ease the problem in the short term. The mayors of San Francisco and Los Angeles acknowledge that the sprawling tent cities of homeless people on their streets have produced an untenable situation that amounts, in some cases, to a public health emergency.", "description": "The rest of the country has historically followed the Golden State\u2019s lead\u2014whether the president likes it or not.", "authors": ["Todd S.
