Analysts say this is risky.\n\nClear majority of Americans support Trump impeachment inquiry, poll finds Read more\n\nFor now, a Republican majority in the Senate insulates Trump against the threat of removal from office. But that advantage does not appear to be guiding the president\u2019s hand.\n\nIn contrast with Bill Clinton\u2019s deflect-and-minimize approach, Trump has taken a more Richard Nixon-like route, treating impeachment as an existential attack and digging in for a gunfighter\u2019s last stand.\n\nIt is a strategy with little margin for error, analysts say, with Trump depending all at once on keeping public approval behind him, on blocking myriad avenues by which Congress might collect evidence and, crucially, on retaining the loyalty of subordinates who will come under increasing pressure to testify.\n\nA major poll released on Tuesday indicated that Trump might be miscalculating badly about public opinion. A 58% majority now support the inquiry versus 38% who oppose it, the Washington Post-Schar School poll found. Support for an impeachment inquiry has grown 20 points in three months, the poll found.\n\nLet them hold me in contempt. We\u2019ll go to court. We\u2019ll challenge the contempt Rudy Giuliani\n\nRegardless, Trump redoubled his strategy of stonewalling, blocking the testimony at the last minute of Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who had flown to Washington to tell Congress what he knew about the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations Trump could use against Joe Biden. Those efforts are at the core of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSondland was prepared to exonerate Trump, the president tweeted, \u201cbut unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court\u201d.\n\nIn a statement issued by his lawyer, Sondland, a hotelier whose support for Trump wavered during the last presidential primary, sent a different message.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland is profoundly disappointed that he will not be able to testify today,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe stands ready to testify on short notice, whenever he is permitted to appear.\u201d\n\nHours later, congressional Democrats said Sondland had been blocked from testifying by a voicemail from superiors in the state department left at 12.30am. They announced they would subpoena Sondland\u2019s testimony and his personal messages, ratcheting up the stakes.\n\nThe blocking of Sondland is part of a wagon-circling throughout the executive branch. On Friday, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, missed a deadline to turn over documents. Congress has also issued subpoenas to the White House, the defense department and the Office of Management and Budget. Vice-President Mike Pence also faces a documents request.\n\nRudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, announced on Tuesday he would defy a congressional subpoena and said: \u201cThe position I\u2019m stating is now the position of the administration.\n\n\u201cLet them hold me in contempt,\u201d Giuliani told the Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to court. We\u2019ll challenge the contempt.\u201d\n\nThe non-appearance of Sondland would only accelerate proceedings, said Adam Schiff, chair of the House committee leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe failure to produce this witness, the failure to produce these documents, we consider yet additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nEven if Trump\u2019s stonewalling damages the ability of Democrats to collect evidence in the short term it could add to the case against him, said Bradley P Moss, a national security lawyer.\n\nSomeone should tell Donald Trump that you can definitely be impeached for obstruction of justice Kamala Harris\n\n\u201cAlthough it arguably would be better from a factual record standpoint to have all relevant fact witnesses testify and produce relevant documentation,\u201d Moss wrote in an email, \u201cif the House Democrats believe they have enough evidence already to proceed to impeachment, they can simply lump in the White House\u2019s refusal to let witnesses testify into an all-encompassing \u2018obstruction\u2019 article of impeachment and throw that on the pile with everything else.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris, a California senator and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted: \u201cSomeone should tell Donald Trump that you can definitely be impeached for obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reliance on the loyalty of subordinates also could represent a strategic misstep \u2013 because former officials are already talking.\n\nAfter resigning, Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, last week delivered to Congress pages of WhatsApp messages between himself and other diplomats that damaged Trump\u2019s efforts to characterize his negotiations on Ukraine.\n\nSchiff has said he wants to speak with another diplomat, Bill Taylor, who wrote in the message exchange: \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Schiff said he would subpoena Gordon Sondland for documents and testimony.

Trump loyalist Jim Jordan, a House Republican from Ohio, launched an attack on Tuesday against \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 reckless haste\u201d. Th Republican senator Lindsey Graham announced a new inquiry that would seek testimony from Giuliani and could compete with the House inquiry in the public mind.\n\nIn terms of public support, Trump does not have nearly so far to fall as Nixon did at a similar juncture.\n\nIt took five months of hearings against Nixon before public approval for the process hit 58%, noted Greg Dworkin, an editor at the liberal Daily Kos.\n\nImpeachment proceedings against Trump are only two weeks old.", "description": "The president is counting on the loyalty of subordinates who will face increasing pressure to testify, and analysts say that is risky", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88c0788b6d4600314bf931d2644443f73dde8677/0_136_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2b865493b29bd109b983fded589a922b", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
