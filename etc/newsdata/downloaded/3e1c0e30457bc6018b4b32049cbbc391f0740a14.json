Now, he and his staff help feed four times that. Before, the clientele was mostly folks struggling to pay rents that shot up during the oil boom. Today, it\u2019s often men and women who were living high before the bust. Sometimes, they pull up in shiny pickups purchased just a year or two ago.\n\n\u201cYou never know who\u2019s going to walk through your door,\u201d said Edwards, the food bank\u2019s director. \u201cIndividuals that have degrees and education and skills\u2014but the jobs just aren\u2019t what they were.\u201d\n\nOnce the booming heart of the country\u2019s energy industry, the little city of 75,000 in northeastern Alberta has become a showcase for the debt troubles many Canadians are facing. Fat paychecks and generous overtime earlier this decade fueled big spending on customized pickups and million-dollar homes. With work drying up, the bill has come due.\n\nRead More: Drowning in Debt, Freaked-Out Canadians Brace for a Reckoning\n\nConsumer insolvency filings in the Fort McMurray district climbed 39% in 2018, the largest percentage increase in Canada, federal data show. Claims against property, the first step in the foreclosure process, surged almost tenfold over the past three years, according to court records. The city\u2019s 90-day delinquency rate on non-mortgage loans climbed to 1.75% in the second quarter, compared with 1.12% nationally, according to Equifax Canada.\n\nThe five-year slump that\u2019s cut oil prices in half since 2014 has been a driver in the bust. What piled on the pain was a crippling shortage of pipelines out of the McMurray Formation, a massive reserve of crude-laden oil sands. Plans for new lines have been squelched or stalled by court challenges from an array of opponents, including U.S. activists who view the oil sands as a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d that will one day unleash a climate catastrophe.\n\nStewardship of the energy industry has become a central issue of Canada\u2019s federal election later this month. The Conservative Party has portrayed itself as a champion of the sector and pledges to remove regulations Prime Minister Justin Trudeau implemented. The Liberals, meanwhile, are trying to strike a balance between developing Alberta\u2019s energy resources and making Canada a leader in combating climate change.\n\nIn May, after five years at Suncor Energy Inc.\u2019s Fort Hills oil-sands mine, Steve Richardson was let go, like many others in the industry.\n\nRichardson earned around six figures most years as a heavy equipment operator. For about 10 months, he commuted from Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with Suncor paying for most of his flights and putting him up in a camp near the work site. He\u2019d dig trenches for 14 days, then go home for seven.\n\nAfter the travel reimbursements stopped, he moved his family to a small town about a seven-hour drive from Fort Mac, so he could keep the job. Now he\u2019s doing short-term work and making economies where he can, such as canceling his family\u2019s cable subscription.\n\n\u201cI spend a lot of time wondering what the next job is going to be,\u201d Richardson, 42, said. He\u2019s thankful he resisted buying boats or taking vacations on credit, as many of his friends did. \u201cI never got into all the toys. I\u2019m kind of fortunate that way, that I didn\u2019t have to sell everything off like some other people. I\u2019ve seen a lot of that. It\u2019s like a fire sale.\u201d\n\nThe energy business has long been core to the local economy. Commercial production got off the ground in the 1940s, but the oil was always a devil to recover. It\u2019s mired in a sludge that has to be tediously pumped out or strip-mined in open pits. Either way, the process is technologically challenging.\n\nThe potential, though, is staggering. With 165.4 billion barrels, these oil sands are the world\u2019s third-largest proven reserve, trailing only those in Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. As oil prices were climbing from 2004 to 2014, the industry invested C$210.1 billion ($157.7 billion), more than last year\u2019s combined total capital spending by all of the companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Dan Edwards watched Fort McMurray, Alberta, turn into the insolvency capital of Canada from a brown brick warehouse on King Street, home to the Wood Buffalo Food Bank.Ten years ago, about 2,000 people came by every month for jars of peanut butter and cans of soup.
