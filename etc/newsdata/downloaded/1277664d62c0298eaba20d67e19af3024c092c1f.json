REUTERS/Reinhard Krause\n\nThe statement came after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed in a phone call Turkey\u2019s plans to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d east of the Euphrates River in Syria.\n\nErdogan said on Saturday a military incursion into northeastern Syria was imminent, after Ankara accused Washington of stalling efforts to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d there together.\n\nTurkey has long vowed to carry out an operation targeting the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which it considers a terrorist organisation tied to Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. The United States helped the YPG defeat Islamic State militants in Syria.\n\n\u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\u201d the White House press secretary said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u201cCaliphate\u201d, will no longer be in the immediate area,\u201d it added.\n\nIn the first Turkish comment following the statement, Erdogan\u2019s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey\u2019s \u201csafe zone\u201d plan was within the framework of Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\n\u201cThe safe zone has two aims: to secure our borders by clearing away terrorist elements and to achieve the return of refugees in a safe way,\u201d Kalin wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cTurkey is powerful and determined,\u201d he added.\n\nTurkey says it wants to settle up to 2 million Syrian refugees in the zone. It currently hosts 3.6 million Syrians sheltering from the more than eight-year conflict in their homeland.\n\nAfter the statements, Turkey's lira TRYTOM=D3 was trading weaker at 5.7150 against the U.S. dollar, compared with a close of 5.70 on Friday.\n\nTURKEY NOW RESPONSIBLE\n\nAfter the Erdogan-Trump phone call, the Turkish presidency said the two leaders had agreed to meet in Washington next month.\n\nIt said that during the call Erdogan had expressed his frustration with the failure of U.S. military and security officials to implement the agreement between the two countries.\n\nThe White House statement said \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years\u201d, as France, Germany and other European nations from which they came refused U.S. requests to take them back.\n\nThe NATO allies agreed in August to establish a zone in northeast Syria along the border with Turkey.\n\nTurkey says the United States, which supports the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a YPG-led force that defeated Islamic State fighters in Syria, has moved too slowly to set up the zone. It has repeatedly warned of launching an offensive on its own into northeast Syria, where U.S. forces are stationed alongside the SDF.\n\nThe two countries are also at odds over how far the zone should extend into Syria and who should control it. Turkey says it should be 30 km (19 miles) deep.\n\nTies between the allies have also been pressured over Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian S-400 defence missiles and the trial of local U.S. consulate employees in Turkey.", "description": "Turkey will soon move forward with its long-planned military operation to create what it calls a \"safe zone\" in northern Syria and U.S. forces will not support or be involved in it, the White House press secretary said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437929771&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950MF", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
