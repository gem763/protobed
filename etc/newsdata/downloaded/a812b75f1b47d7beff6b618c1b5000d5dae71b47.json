Everybody wants to resolve this peacefully and the end result has to be an end to Iran\u2019s aggressive policies.\u201d\n\nIran has denied it carried out the attack with President Rouhani calling it a reciprocal act by the \u201cYemeni people\u201d.\n\n\u201cUS is in denial if it thinks that Yemeni victims of 4.5yrs of the worst war crimes wouldn\u2019t do all to strike back,\u201d foreign minister Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nBut on Saturday, the commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) took a more defiant tone and said the country would \u201cdestroy\u201d any aggressor.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d Major General Hossein Salami said on state television.\n\n\u201cOur readiness to respond to any aggression is definitive. We will never allow a war to enter our land. We will pursue any aggressor. We will continue until the full destruction of any aggressor.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told The Independent that Iran will \u201cresist militarily\u201d if Washington now seeks to apply military pressure on Tehran.\n\nOn Friday, the Saudi-led coalition carried out an attack in Yemen in areas north of Yemen\u2019s port city of Hodeidah, in the first such response since the 14 September strikes.\n\nThe Houthis have since said that they would cease missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, warning that it could lead to more \u201cdangerous development\u201d.\n\nThe United Nations welcomed the announcement, saying the move \u201cin good faith could send a powerful message of the will to end the war\u201d.\n\nThis comes as the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York this week, where Iran\u2019s president has said he will present a plan for creating security in the Gulf.\n\n\u201cThis year we will present a plan to the world at the United Nations that the Islamic Republic of Iran in cooperation with the countries of the region can create security for the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea with the help of the countries of the region,\u201d Mr Rouhani was cited as saying on his official website. He did not provide further details.\n\nThere had been discussions about whether this would provide a forum for a meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Rouhani after the US president appeared to allude to his openness to meet.\n\nBut both sides have since stepped back from the possibility, with Mr Araghchi reiterating to The Independent that \u201cIran will not negotiate under pressure\u201d.\n\nReferring to the crippling US sanctions on the country, he said: \u201cTo get real negotiations started, this economic war has to end.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Saudi Arabia has warned that if it finds that last week\u2019s attack on its oil facilities were launched from Iranian territory then it would be considered an \u201cact of war\u201d.", "authors": ["Gemma Fox"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/18/17/2019-09-18T162953Z-1764865292-RC138E6D5520-RTRMADP-3-SAUDI-ARAMCO-DEFENCE.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
