While the Chiefs and Detroit Lions scored a fair amount of points during the contest, it wasn\u2019t done with deep passes and offensive domination. It was done mostly with fumbles and turnovers.\n\nThe Chiefs and Lions combined for five lost fumbles during the Chiefs\u2019 34-30 win. All five of those fumbles came in the same quarter. The last time that happened in an NFL game was back in 1991, according to Fox.\n\nThose fumbles had a significant impact on the game. Both teams entered the third quarter tied 13-13. The Chiefs opened the half with the ball, but immediately fumbled it away on the kickoff. Six plays later, the Lions gave it right back. With the team at the 5-yard line, Matthew Stafford fumbled trying to run away from pressure.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Chiefs failed to capitalize. Five plays later, running back Darrel Williams fumbled to give the Lions the ball back on the Chiefs\u2019 28-yard line. That\u2019s when things went horribly wrong for the Lions.\n\nWith the team on the 1-yard line, Kerryon Johnson fumbled while trying to extend the ball over the goal line. Chiefs cornerback Bashaud Breeland scooped up the ball right near the end zone and ran it all the way back for the touchdown. The officials never blew the whistle on the play, allowing things to play out. After review, the touchdown was upheld. It was the first time since 2000 a team returned a 100+ yard fumble for a touchdown, according to Fox.\n\nStory continues\n\nDetroit refused to go quietly after that play. The team kicked a field goal on their next drive, and then were able to re-take the lead thanks to ... you guessed it ... another fumble. On the Chiefs\u2019 next drive, Sammy Watkins fumbled on the Chiefs\u2019 own 45-yard line. The Lions surged ahead eight plays later, when Stafford found Kenny Golladay in the end zone. That put Detroit up 23-20.\n\nThe two teams continued to go back-and-forth in the final quarter. Another Golladay touchdown put the Lions up 30-27 with a little over two minutes to play. That gave the Chiefs one more opportunity to take the lead.\n\nThey delivered. Mahomes led a 13-play, 79-yard drive to put the Chiefs on top for good. Kansas City scored on a 1-yard run by Williams with just 20 seconds left on the clock. The play gave the Chiefs a 34-30 lead.\n\nThe Lions still showed fight with just a few seconds left. Stafford hit Marvin Jones to get to the 50-yard line. The Lions then inched forward on the next play, giving the team nine seconds to throw a Hail Mary. Stafford\u2019s first attempt hit the ground, but left 1 second left on the clock. His second attempt was batted down at the 2-yard line.\n\nWith the win, the Chiefs remain perfect this season. The team is 4-0 and will take on the Indianapolis Colts in Week 5. The Lions dropped to 2-1-1 following the loss. They\u2019ll try to iron things out during a bye next week.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
