He had held the post since March 2018.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTwo people said Kaplan\u2019s resignation was effective immediately. It is unclear what prompted Kaplan\u2019s departure.\n\nKaplan\u2019s position put him in charge of the International Trade Administration, a 2,100-person agency which oversees enforcement of U.S. trade laws, export promotion activities and other issues. Kaplan was also involved in the administration\u2019s trade talks with China.\n\nKaplan had previously worked as a trade attorney at King & Spalding where he represented the U.S. steel industry and other domestic companies petitioning for protective duties.\n\nThe broader Commerce Department has been said to be slipping into dysfunction under Ross, whose leadership has been questioned. Morale has been low as Ross hasn\u2019t been seen leading the department but rather using Commerce\u2019s functions as tools to curry favor with the president.\n\nThe administration has repeatedly touted an increase in trade enforcement since President Donald Trump took office with the initiation of 182 new trade investigations of unfairly traded imports, a 231 percent increase compared to the same period of the previous administration, according to Commerce.\n\nUnder Kaplan\u2019s tenure, the agency has also taken measures to more aggressively counter China. That included the first self-initiated trade investigation in 25 years. U.S. companies are usually responsible for petitioning for duties. In another major policy shift, the department is looking at using undervalued currency as a criteria for imposing punitive tariffs.\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: Commerce Department\n\nTrade", "description": "He had held the post since March 2018.", "authors": ["Adam Behsudi", "Nancy Cook", "Doug Palmer"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3e/e0/d9155f5d4d4389fa0f4b915b7ccc/190920-gilbert-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
