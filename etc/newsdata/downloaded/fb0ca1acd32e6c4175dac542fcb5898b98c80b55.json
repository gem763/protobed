Trump has seized on an unsubstantiated theory that Biden was trying to protect the company from prosecution when he called for the firing Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor in 2016. Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, has pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate the matter.\n\nWhy is this coming up now?\n\nBecause of an intelligence community whistleblower who filed a complaint last month about the president\u2019s actions. An inspector general deemed the complaint \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who has refused to share it with Congress. The issue was brought into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., sent an angry letter to Maguire Sept. 10 demanding the complaint be shared with his panel.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks about recent flooding and rainfall in Texas at U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Houston after he arrived at Ellington Field and before going to a \"Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams, Bright Futures\" event with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, in Webster, Texas.

Reporting by The New York Times and others has established that the complaint involves Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine and a phone call with a foreign leader \u2014 possibly, but not necessarily, Zelenskiy. It is not clear if it includes other matters.\n\nDid Trump use U.S. foreign policy to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival?\n\nThis is the big question. The White House this summer blocked a package of military assistance to Ukraine. The aid was intended to help the country defend itself from Russian territorial aggression, including a military conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. The delay of the aid was first publicly disclosed about a month after the July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy. Trump is not known to have openly linked the aid \u2014 which has since been released \u2014 to his demands for political investigations, but many Democrats believe that may be the case.\n\nWhat does Trump say?\n\nThe president insists that he has been unfairly accused, saying \u2014 without offering evidence \u2014 that the whistleblower is \u201cpartisan\u201d and that Democrats and the news media are initiating a new \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. Trump has said that he is aware that his conversations with foreign leaders are monitored by numerous government officials and that he would not incriminate himself so easily.\n\nWhat is Giuliani\u2019s role in this?\n\nGiuliani has communicated with Ukrainian officials for months about the Bidens, as well as about the circumstances of the 2016 disclosures of payments earmarked by a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party to Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman, who is now serving a prison sentence on charges related to his Ukrainian political work. Giuliani has sought information about both subjects, and traveled to Madrid this summer for a meeting with one of Zelenskiy\u2019s top aides, whom he urged to investigate the matters.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is under intense scrutiny over a classified whistleblower complaint about his behavior, which at least partly involves his dealings with Ukraine's new president and Trump's call for Ukraine's government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who", "authors": ["Michael Crowley", "Kenneth P.
