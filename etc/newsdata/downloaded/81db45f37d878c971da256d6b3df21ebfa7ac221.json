REUTERS/Juan Medina/File Photo\n\nInvestors are closely watching Fernandez\u2019s comments on debt after the South American nation was forced to announce plans to renegotiate around $100 billion in bonds after a sharp market crash in August pushed the country towards default.\n\nThe Peronist candidate, who soundly beat market-friendly incumbent Mauricio Macri in an August primary, is the distant favourite to win the Oct. 27 general election. How his administration will handle the debt crisis is one of the key questions for the country and its local and global backers.\n\n\u201cIndebtedness it the biggest issues Argentina faces today,\u201d Fernandez said on Twitter late on Thursday, aiming criticism at Macri\u2019s administration for taking on too much debt. \u201c(But) we never said we wouldn\u2019t pay or that there would be a haircut.\u201d\n\nHe added that the country - in recession for much of the last year - needed to return to growth and to bolster exports to be able to meet its obligations.\n\n\u201cWe will pay the debts by growing and exporting ... The only way is to export. The other channel has been exhausted, which is to borrow,\u201d he said, adding the country needed time to \u201cdefer\u201d its debts to ensure it could pay them in full.\n\nIn separate comments at an event in Cordoba, he said Argentina should be able to replicate the model of neighbouring Uruguay, which successfully undertook voluntary debt renegotiations in 2003, and is widely seen as a positive model.\n\nCredit Suisse said in a note on Friday that Fernandez\u2019s comments were good news for the country\u2019s creditors.\n\n\u201cWe think that Fernandez\u2019s remarks regarding paying debt without a haircut, along with his track record, suggest that he could pursue a moderate economic policy course if elected,\u201d the investment bank said.\n\nThe bank added though that how Fernandez would achieve his goals of spurring growth while maintaining fiscal discipline under a $57 billion credit facility struck the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year remained \u201cunclear\u201d.", "description": "Argentina's presidential front runner Alberto Fernandez has said that, if elected next month, he would aim to avoid haircuts on bond payments and seek a moderate \"Uruguay-style\" debt restructuring, music to the ears of the country's creditors.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434558101&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q140", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
