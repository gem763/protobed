The $51 level of course is an area that is crucial, so it\u2019s likely that we will continue to see a lot of support in this general vicinity. However, I think it\u2019s only a matter time before the market sells off again, especially near the $55 level. If we were to break down below the $51 level, it\u2019s likely that the market would reach towards the $45 level underneath.\n\nCrude Oil Inventories Video 07.10.19\n\nBrent\n\nBrent markets also have rallied a bit during the trading session on Friday, breaking above the top of the hammer from the previous day. At this point in time it\u2019s likely that the $60 level will offer a bit of resistance though, just as the 50 day EMA will as well. Ultimately, if you break down below the $56 level, the market then has support all the way down to the $55 level, making it a bit of his own rather than a specific level. Breaking down below the $55 level opens up a move down to the $50 handle next.

At this point, the market breaking higher makes sense as we had gotten a bit low.
