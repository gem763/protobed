REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nThe big-screen continuation of the popular British TV show beat expectations with $31 million when it debuted in 3,079 theaters, setting a new opening weekend record for the studio. \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d easily surpassed newcomers \u201cAd Astra\u201d and \u201cRambo: Last Blood,\u201d which are in a close race for second place.\n\nOverseas, the royal period drama has collected $41 million to date for a worldwide tally of $61.8 million. Series creator Julian Fellowes wrote \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d while Michael Engler directed. Much of the cast from the TV show \u2014 including Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, Michelle Dockery and Maggie Smith \u2014 returned for the film adaptation.\n\nMoviegoers, consisting mostly of older females, awarded the film with an A CinemaScore \u2014 the highest grade among this weekend\u2019s new offerings. For comparison, \u201cAd Astra\u201d landed a B- and \u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d secured a B. As for \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d 74% of ticket buyers were female and 60% were over the age of 35.\n\n\u201cAudiences were clearly ready to come back to Downton and visit the Crawleys and all the familiar faces upstairs and downstairs,\u201d said Lisa Bunnell, Focus Features president of distribution. \u201cAt its core, it\u2019s a story about family and audiences, both original fans and newcomers, are uplifted by that laughter and joy of the film.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cAd Astra\u201d looks to have pulled slightly ahead of \u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d in North America, arriving on the higher end of projections with $19.2 million from 3,450 venues. Still, the astronaut drama starring Brad Pitt and directed by James Gray will need to have a long journey in multiplexes to justify its $80 million price tag. \u201cAd Astra\u201d follows Roy McBride (Pitt), an astronaut on a mission across time and space to uncover the truth about his missing father. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga, Liv Tyler and Donald Sutherland.\n\nThough \u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d was forecasted to lead box office charts, the final chapter in Sylvester Stallone\u2019s action franchise should finish the weekend in third place. The film earned $19.015 million from 3,618 locations, in line with studio expectations and slightly ahead of 2008\u2019s \u201cRambo\u201d ($18.2 million), the latest entry to grace the silver screen. Adrian Grunberg directed the film, which was co-written by Stallone.\n\n\u201cRambo: Last Blood\u201d is expected to be Stallone\u2019s final go-around as John Rambo, a character first introduced to audiences in the 1980s. To no surprise, older men accounted for majority of opening weekend crowds: 66% of opening weekend crowds were male, while 42% were over the age of 30.\n\nAfter two weeks atop domestic box office charts, Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cIt: Chapter Two\u201d slid to No. 4. The sequel, based on Stephen King\u2019s terrifying novel, pulled in $17.2 million during its third outing for a domestic tally of $179 million.\n\nRounding out the top five is STX\u2019s \u201cHustlers\u201d with $17 million, an especially promising figure considering three new films debuted this weekend. After two weeks of release, \u201cHustlers\u201d has amassed $62 million in North America and $9.84 million overseas for a worldwide haul of $72 million. The film \u2014 directed by Lorene Scafaria and starring Jennifer Lopez, Constance Wu, Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart \u2014 cost $20 million to produce.\n\nNot all holdovers were as fortunate. Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d plummeted to No. 15, scraping together just $760,000 from 2,542 theaters during its second weekend in theaters. Ansel Elgort stars in the movie adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, which has made $4.5 million to date. Though Amazon Studios co-financed \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d the $45 million film still stands to be a big money loser for Warner Bros.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, (Variety.com) - In a box office win fit for a queen, Focus Features' \"Downton Abbey\" ruled over the competition in North America.", "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432653668&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0JE-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
