Some individuals were tasked in manufacturing the skimmers, whereas others would launder stolen proceeds by passing cash through bank accounts or funnel their criminal gains through properties and businesses.\n\nSee also: Most ATMs can be hacked in under 20 minutes\n\nHundreds of ATM skimming operations have taken place across the US due to this one group and their influence has been felt in New York and at least 17 other states.\n\nA series of arrests were made across the US, Mexico, and Italy. The 18 suspects are being charged with offenses including access device fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft in Manhattan Federal Court.\n\nCNET: California proposes regulations to enforce new privacy law\n\nIf found guilty, the individuals -- hailing from the US, Romania, and Greece -- may face up between 7.5 and 10 years behind bars for access device fraud; 30 years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, and a penalty of two years for aggravated identity theft.\n\nIn addition, some of the defendants are being charged with money laundering, an accusation that could lead to a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nATMs, given their role as a machine offering the general public convenient access to their money, are a constant target for those seeking to commit banking crimes or identity theft.\n\nTechRepublic: Financial industry spends millions to deal with breaches\n\nWhile these front-facing devices are important to us, the covert installation of devices containing cameras and skimmer technologies can be missed -- and when it comes to their insides, old operating systems susceptible to malware are common.\n\nLast year, Positive Technologies researchers conducted a range of tests on ATMs from NCR, Diebold Nixdorf, and GRGBanking, and found that many could be compromised in as little as 20 minutes.\n\nThe US is not the only country to take the compromise of ATMs seriously. Across the pond, European police have cracked down on ATM hacking rings under Operation Neptune, leading to multiple arrests and the seizure of over 1,000 counterfeit debit cards.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
