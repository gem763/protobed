Salazar, former coach to British runner Mo Farah, has been banned for four years\n\nSalazar, who coached Farah between 2011 and 2017, was banned for four years last week\n\nNeither will it be favourable that his team missed their medal target at the World Championships.\n\nSpeaking publicly for the first time since last Monday's ruling on Salazar, who coached Farah between 2011 and 2017, Black was non-committal on whether he would survive the aftermath.\n\nAsked directly if he would resign, he said: 'Travelling home I'll be reviewing all the information. The board will obviously review all the information and the first person I'll speak to will be the chair Chris Clark.\n\n'We will go through it in detail and that's the point I personally will begin to think about my understanding of it, the implications and how I feel about it.'\n\nWhen pushed to clarify if he would resign, he said: 'I'm not able to answer with any more detail.'\n\nWhile Black wants to stay through the Tokyo Olympics next year, he could face internal and external pressure to go after his emphatic backing of Salazar in the past, which previously included hiring him as a consultant to UKA and once describing him as a 'genius'.\n\nWith UKA having said in 2015 that they had 'no concerns' about Salazar's coaching relationship with their prime medal winner, their board and performance oversight committee is currently reviewing the full findings of the US Anti-Doping Agency investigation.\n\nSalazar (centre) pictured with Mo Farah (right) and American athlete Galen Rupp in 2012\n\nThere is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Black or Farah, who has never failed a drugs test.\n\nDuring USADA's four-year investigation, they alleged Salazar's doctor, Dr Jeffrey Brown \u2013 also banned for four years \u2013 was complicit with Salazar in 'prescribing excessive and dangerous levels of prescription vitamin D and thyroid medicines to NOP athletes, hoping these prescriptions would increase testosterone levels'.\n\nOwing to the links between Salazar, Black and UKA's head of endurance Barry Fudge, Black was asked if UKA had incorporated similar methods and received medications that were not medically necessary.\n\nBlack said: 'I am very, very sure that no British athletes have been involved in any of those processes, I am very sure about that.'\n\nAsked specifically if thyroid medication had been used in that manner, he said: 'Certainly to the best of my knowledge, no British athlete has ever taken thyroid medication when it wasn't required. It was obviously confidential information but the only time any medication was used and so on was for a medical reason, without any question.'\n\nPressure has also mounted on Black after British athletes failed to achieve their medal target\n\nThe renewed focus on Farah's work with Salazar \u2013 a period in which he won all four of his Olympic gold medals \u2013 comes ahead of Sunday's Chicago marathon. Black will fly to the US this week to support Farah's preparations.\n\nBlack, who has not yet read the full USADA report, said: 'Nothing at all has changed in terms of my belief regarding Mo Farah. I think it is important to repeat that the British Athletics and the medical and support teams were always the people who were always on top of, and managing and directing the care of Mo Farah, so we have no concerns.'\n\nThe scrutiny on Black follows the failure of his team to hit their UK Sport medal target of seven to nine, with only five won in Doha. Their placings between fourth and eighth also fell from 19 at London 2017 to 11.\n\nBlack said: 'There's a lot to feel really good about. But the reality is the medal tally is not that which we would have wanted.\n\n'It could be better, it should be better. We'll obviously be talking with UK Sport. Our relationship with UK Sport is really positive. It's a working together, it's reviewing, planning, what have we learnt, what are we going to do about it, how do we convert the nearlies into medals.'", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN DOHA: There are growing doubts over Neil Black's future as the performance director of UK Athletics after he refused to rule out resigning after the Alberto Salazar scandal.", "authors": ["Riath Al-Samarrai For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/11/19389034-0-image-a-46_1570442661222.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
