The unionist party that backs Johnson\u2019s minority Conservative government in London also raised concerns.\n\nWith talks due to continue in Brussels on Monday, a spokesman for Johnson said \"significant work\u201d was still needed before a deal can be done.\n\nThe Frenzied Fortnight That\u2019s Set to Seal the Fate of Brexit\n\nNegotiators are now in a race against time to sketch out an accord for EU leaders to endorse at a summit that starts on Thursday. Johnson wants an agreement at that gathering so that members of the U.K. Parliament can vote to approve or reject it in a special session on Saturday. That way, he may just be able to avoid being forced to delay Britain\u2019s departure beyond the Oct. 31 deadline, which he has vowed to meet.\n\nThe next 48 hours will be crucial, with the bloc wanting to know by Wednesday how the negotiations are to proceed. If Barnier\u2019s talks founder, EU leaders will have to decide whether to abandon them and move on to the question of whether to allow Britain to delay its departure. Or, if there\u2019s still a chance of a breakthrough, they may hold another emergency summit shortly before Brexit day, according to officials in Brussels.\n\nThe prime minister told his cabinet on Sunday that a deal with Brussels is still possible. But any agreement would still have to be ratified by the U.K. Parliament, which will be re-opened by Queen Elizabeth II on Monday. Johnson, who lacks a majority, will be vulnerable to attempts to oust him or reject any Brexit deal he reaches. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn warned on Sunday that he was unlikely to support any deal agreed by Johnson.\n\nThe obstacle the negotiators are grappling with is the thorny question of how to ensure there is no need for checkpoints to inspect goods crossing the border between the Republic of Ireland and the U.K. region of Northern Ireland after Brexit.\n\nLast week, Johnson put forward plans to take Northern Ireland out of Europe\u2019s customs union and give Stormont, its power-sharing assembly, a veto over the arrangement. EU officials say both of these are hugely problematic.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Offer\n\nThe U.K. has softened its position on the veto and has proposed a complex customs solution that would see Northern Ireland leave the EU\u2019s customs union but still adhere to its rules. The U.K. wants to be able to track goods entering Northern Ireland but treat them differently depending on where they are due to end up, two officials said.\n\nThat may incur the wrath of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party -- which is in a formal agreement to support Johnson\u2019s government and influences how a significant number his euro-skeptic Conservative MPs vote. DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds told Italy\u2019s La Repubblica on Saturday that the party would reject any solution that would weaken Northern Ireland\u2019s custom ties to the U.K.\n\nIn Brussels on Sunday, Barnier updated envoys from EU governments on the progress in the talks, which re-started in earnest on Friday. He said the latest version of Johnson\u2019s customs proposal was untested, risked undermining the EU\u2019s single market by leaving it vulnerable to fraud, and was unlikely to be nailed down in the next few days, according to officials.\n\nIf talks break down, Johnson is required under a new law to delay Brexit, something that he has vowed to avoid. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker indicated on Sunday that he would approve another delay, if the British side asked for it.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ian Wishart in Brussels at iwishart@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson at fjackson@bloomberg.net, Edward Evans, Tim Ross\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson\u2019s attempt to secure a Brexit deal ran into trouble after the European Union warned the talks were still a long way from a breakthrough and the British prime minister\u2019s political allies distanced themselves from his plans.After a weekend of intensive negotiations in Brussels", "authors": ["Ian Wishart"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GzLoeIQ5PduSOTRIl80GzA--~B/aD0xMjY4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/99c95f7b1481491c327d7537f767681f", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
