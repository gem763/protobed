USA TODAY\n\nWhen the Chicago Cubs moved on from Joe Maddon at the end of the regular season, both he and president of baseball operations Theo Epstein agreed a change was needed for the good of the organization.\n\nApparently, that change involves bringing in a key cog from the 2016 World Series team.\n\nThe Cubs have agreed to make David Ross their next manager, a person with knowledge of the hiring told USA TODAY Sports' Bob Nightengale.\n\nRoss enjoyed a 15-year MLB career that spanned seven organizations. He finished his time in the major leagues with two seasons on Chicago's north side and homered in the classic Game 7 of the 2016 Fall Classic, which was Ross' final game. He won his first title as a member of the Boston Red Sox in 2013.\n\nChicago Cubs special assistant special David Ross during a Spring Training workout at Sloan Park. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe catcher then transitioned from behind the plate to the broadcast booth. For the last three years, Ross has worked at ESPN as a studio analyst and color commentator on broadcasts.\n\nHe has also been a special assistant to baseball operations to the Cubs since January 2017.\n\nRoss followed a similar blueprint set out by New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone, who worked at ESPN for some time before heading back to the dugout. Another ESPN personality, Eduardo Perez, has been closely linked to the New York Mets job.\n\nRoss is one of the first managerial dominoes to fall, as Maddon landed with the Los Angeles Angels last week. The Mets, Kansas City Royals, San Francisco Giants, San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates are still seeking to fill their skipper vacancies.", "description": "The Chicago Cubs have hired David Ross as their next manager.
