Human Rights chief and former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet said via Twitter she will be dispatching a team to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in the country by Pinera\u2019s government, which has come under scrutiny for its strong response to the unrest.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said in a statement that the death toll rose to 20 over the weekend after a burned body was found inside a supermarket that was torched during protests on Oct. 24.", "description": "Oct. 29 (UPI) \u2014 Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has replaced key members of his Cabinet amid ongoing violent protests that have resulted in at", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
