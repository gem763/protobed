And of course there are clear differences,\" he said.\n\nChina has previously denied any improper activities, accusing Australia of adopting a \"Cold War mentality\".\n\nReuters reported this month that Australian intelligence had determined China was responsible for a cyberattack on the national parliament and three largest political parties before a general election in May, according to five people with direct knowledge of the matter. Foreign Ministry denied involvement in any hacking attacks and said the internet was full of theories that were hard to trace.\n\nHackers were also targeting its most prestigious university, an official report by the Australian National University (ANU) showed, which stoked fears that China could influence research and students.\n\nThe ANU said last week its investigators were unable to identify who was responsible for the cyberattack. students are worth about A$35 billion a year to the Australian economy, with Chinese students accounting for about a third of that figure.\n\nAustralian universities are financially dependent on overseas students, raising fears that foreign governments could exert undue influence.\n\nAs a result, Australian universities will now be required to work with security agencies to ensure they guard against undue foreign interference.", "description": "UPDATE 2-Senior Australian minister says China is behaving badly, draws rebuke", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
