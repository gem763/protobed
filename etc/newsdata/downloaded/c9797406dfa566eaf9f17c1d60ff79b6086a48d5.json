I take it personal. You step on this football field and you represent our defense, this is how we\u2019re going to play.\u201d\n\nAllen couldn\u2019t quibble with the latest game tape.\n\nBut it\u2019s this season\u2019s rollercoaster ride that has tested his patience.\n\nHe was stunned by the number of missed tackles in a season-opening victory over Ball State and fumed after his defense gave up 91 points in losses to Ohio State and Michigan State.\n\nYet in victories over Eastern Illinois, Connecticut and Rutgers, the Hoosiers defense barely cracked - allowing just three total points. And it will be tough to match what the Hoosiers accomplished Saturday.\n\nIndiana held Rutgers to the fewest passing yards in a Football Bowl Subdivision game all season, the lowest total allowed by the Hoosiers in a single game since 1985. The total yards marked the fewest allowed by Indiana in a Big Ten game since 1966.\n\nThe Hoosiers have now recorded four shutouts since 2017, second in the Big Ten to Wisconsin, which has four shutouts this season.\n\nReakwon Jones\u2019 fumble return for a touchdown on the first play Saturday also is believed to be the fastest score in Memorial Stadium history.\n\nOf course, Indiana (4-2, 1-2 Big Ten) did that against a team reeling from the midseason firing of its head coach and offensive coordinator and the loss of its top two quarterbacks and top offensive playmaker.\n\nThat\u2019s not good enough for Allen, though.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get harder,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut to me, it\u2019s encouraging to see it. You\u2019ve got to see it first with whoever you\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nIndiana\u2019s next chance comes this weekend at Maryland (3-3, 1-2), which struggled without starting quarterback Josh Jackson in last weekend\u2019s loss at Purdue.\n\nAnd Allen expects the Hoosiers to continue building off the foundation they showed last weekend. He expects them to play cleaner, force more turnovers and become the kind of asset he anticipated from the moment he was hired as defensive coordinator in 2016.\n\nHis expectations haven\u2019t changed since he was promoted to head coach in December 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of very, very intense meetings about getting some of these things corrected,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI thought Saturday was just a good exhibition of just good, fundamentally sound football defensively and playing with fanatical effort. It\u2019s all leading up to what we\u2019re about to get into.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tom Allen came to Indiana to build a rock solid defense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/aptopix_rutgers_indiana_football_31800_c0-118-2798-1750_s1200x700.jpg?15532ca136a9e02fc06c84239a89d48d0c9c7a1a", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
