What we are trying to avoid is any kind of shenanigans on the government's side, any kind of moving of the goal posts which would allow a No Deal crash-out.'\n\nHow can Boris Johnson force an early general election? There are two ways in which the UK could end up having an early general election. Both are set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. The first is that a Commons vote is held on a motion that simply states: 'That there shall be an early parliamentary general election.' In order to pass, that motion must be backed by at least two thirds of MPs which means it would be dependent on the support of Labour in order to succeed. Boris Johnson has tried to trigger an election in this way on two previous occasions but he failed on both attempts as opposition MPs refused to back a snap poll. The second route to an election is if the government was toppled in a vote of no confidence which convention dictates can only be asked for by the Leader of the Opposition. If such a vote was held and it succeeded - potentially with the government opting to abstain in order to lose on purpose - there would then follow a 14 day period in which another government could try to be formed. If no new government could command the support of a Commons majority by the close of that period then an early election would be automatically triggered.\n\nMr Corbyn reportedly recently told Labour MPs that they 'cannot afford to turn down another election request'.\n\nOne of his leading allies, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, echoed a similar sentiment this morning as he said that he wanted an election as soon as a chaotic divorce from the EU was ruled out.\n\nOutlining the circumstances in which Labour would back a snap poll, he said: 'If the EU responds by agreeing an extension of a number of months that means that Boris Johnson in that time can't push us out through a No Deal Brexit.'\n\nMr Burgon said 'Labour will be calling for a general election once a No Deal is off the table'.\n\nMany Labour MPs are concerned about their chances at a general election if the party sticks to its current policy of staying neutral on Brexit.\n\nMr Corbyn's plan is to stay neutral, win power at an election and then offer voters a second referendum with Labour picking a side in the run up to the ballot.\n\nA number of recent opinion polls have given the Tories double digit leads over Labour despite the ongoing Brexit chaos.\n\nEven if Mr Corbyn wins the internal battle over backing an election it is still possible that many Labour MPs could defy him when it actually comes to the vote in the Commons.\n\nBen Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter, hinted at that possibility today as he said the likes of Mr Burgon would 'feel very lonely in the division lobby' voting in favour of an election.\n\nIf two thirds of MPs voted in favour of an election, the law dictates that the polling day must take place at least 25 working days later.\n\nThat means that if a vote on an election was to take place before the end of next week, the nation could go to the polls at the start of December.", "description": "Labour was today at war over whether to support an early general election amid growing fears the party will be decimated if it stays neutral on Brexit at a snap poll.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20088204-0-image-a-15_1571842694083.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
