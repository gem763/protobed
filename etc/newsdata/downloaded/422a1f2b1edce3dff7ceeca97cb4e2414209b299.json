But I'm not being soft on China, I'm keeping tariffs up. That's kind of the path of least resistance right now for President Trump,\" Hirson said.\n\n\"(Trump) can show that he's being tough, but he doesn't have to take the sacrifices, make the concessions necessary to arrive at a broad trade deal,\" he added.", "description": "The deal could involve China buying more American farm goods and a delay in raising U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that are slated for Oct. 15, said Michael Hirson of Eurasia Group.", "authors": ["Stella Soon"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106030892-1563708018099gettyimages-1133448927.jpeg?v=1570685907", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
