She stitched me up on my birthday, so I got the hump. I just got the nark. We fell out.\n\n'We had a massive row and called each other all the names under the sun. It was worse than anything on a soap opera.'\n\n'She is quite grown up. She doesn't argue back. But I am horrible.'\n\nWar of words: Jessie and Danielle spent 10 years at loggerheads, after Danielle accused the actress of turning her back on her stepfather Ron Mason, who was battling leukaemia (pictured in 2017)\n\nJessie's representatives have been approached for comment by MailOnline.\n\nIn April 2018 Jessie and Danielle appeared to have cast their conflict aside on, as they celebrated Easter together for the first time in a decade.\n\nTaking to her Instagram story, glamour model Danielle shared a snap of herself and the EastEnders star, who is her half-sister, hugging as they enjoyed a day of festivity with their family.\n\nThe pair looked closer than ever in the snap, as they tightly embraced for the camera - after over a decade of conflict.\n\nAn source close to the family told MailOnline at the time: 'They\u2019re stronger than ever and they\u2019ve really pulled through. Everyone\u2019s really proud of them.\n\nHappier times: In April 2018 Jessie and Danielle appeared to have cast their conflict aside on, as they celebrated Easter together for the first time in a decade (pictured above)\n\n'Just like with all siblings, they still have their ups and downs and of course, neither are known to hold back.\n\n'But they\u2019re much tighter now and make up quickly, it\u2019s as if no time has passed really!'\n\nIn 2014, Danielle told The Sun that Jessie\u2019s family were reportedly so appalled by her behaviour that they had \u2018washed their hands of her\u2019.\n\nHer dad was taken into hospital two months later, and doctors warned his family that he may not survive to see Christmas.\n\nParted ways: The soap star's sister revealed that they had a major fall out in March earlier this year and are no longer on speaking terms, reports The Daily Star Sunday (Jessie pictured on EastEnders)\n\nDanielle said: \u2018Jessie\u2019s behaviour has disgusted us. Dad was dying in intensive care, Mum was in pieces and Jessie couldn\u2019t even be bothered to pick up the phone.\u2019\n\n\u2018Luckily he pulled through. But if he hadn\u2019t, he would have died without Jessie ever seeing him again. And the worst part of it is I don\u2019t think she cared.\u2019\n\nShe claimed that Jessie knew of her stepfather\u2019s condition but had not been to visit him, and sent just two texts to her mother asking about his health.\n\nIn one message sent on his diagnosis, Jessie reportedly said she was \u2018sorry\u2019 and asked if the family were okay. In the second message Jessie is said to have wished her family a Happy New Year.\n\nDanielle added that Ron, who had been married to her mother Annette for nearly 40 years, helped raise Jessie, saying: \u2018He always treated her like his own daughter.\n\n'He would have comforted Jessie when she fell over and scraped her knee, or had nightmares, and lots of her childhood memories will be with him and mum.\u2019\n\nHowever, the pair resolved their feud in 2016, following Ron's tragic passing.", "description": "EastEnders actress Jessie Wallace is reportedly locked in another feud with her sister Danielle Mason after they made-up following a bitter 10 year row.", "authors": ["Charlotte Dean For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/01/19942544-0-image-a-44_1571532717123.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
