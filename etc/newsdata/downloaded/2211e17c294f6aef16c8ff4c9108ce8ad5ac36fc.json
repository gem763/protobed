The history graduate student, who\u2019s in his early 20s, grew up Catholic in central Massachusetts in what he described as \u201ca pretty staunch Republican household\u201d. But in college, a love of history, particularly the Roman Empire, ultimately drew him to monarchism and away from what he described as the \u201crah-rah American republicanism\u201d of his childhood.\n\n\u201cMost people tend to get more liberal in college,\u201d he told me. While earning his undergraduate degree at a Catholic liberal arts school close to where he grew up, he explained: \u201cI ended up looking into medieval political theory and getting more conservative. The monarchies I find most interesting and think we should replicate go back to the late Middle Ages.\u201d\n\nSean\u2019s views shifted not only thanks to his medieval studies, but also after learning more about US foreign policy.\n\n\u201cHaving a background in history, I naturally gravitated toward monarchism because I felt that my national government wasn\u2019t looking at issues of public welfare or national coherence or national unity,\u201d he said. \u201cOur political system has been irrevocably poisoned by political partisanship.\u201d\n\nI connected with Sean through the message boards of r/monarchism, a growing and diverse community of monarchy-lovers on Reddit that boasts almost 10,000 members, and touts itself as \u201ca forum for those who think monarchy is a noble and viable alternative to the crude and materialistic mob mentality of republicanism\u201d. These message boards feature a glut of inspirational images of various monarchs: King George VI going down a slide, Swedish King Carl XVI Gustav, Prince William and his family, and Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nMonarchism is still active in around 40 countries, and whatever you may think of the practice, Sean\u2019s analysis of the brokenness of our system is spot on. In the United States, the political atmosphere has been totally spoiled by radical divisiveness \u2013 a fact exacerbated by Donald Trump\u2019s ascent into the Oval Office. The notion that something is deeply wrong with how our government works is inescapable, so it\u2019s no surprise that people are searching for alternative ideologies.\n\nWhen you think of monarchy, you might think of an inbred Habsburg \u2013 the family\u2019s distinctive jaw, how generations of rulers crippled by a variety of diseases due to their tendency to marry within the immediate family. But for Sean and other members of the subreddit, monarchism is not merely about having a supreme ruler and an inherited throne. Most members of the community deplore authoritarian regimes. They aren\u2019t simply searching for order via a supreme leader, but a return to tradition. \u201cA monarchy is based around the nation showing respect for its past, its people and the culture,\u201d one Reddit user explained.\n\nI went full turncoat when I saw how moronically people were treating politics after 2016 and realized that our current system was breeding a bunch of nutjobs\n\nOf course, there are many different kinds of monarchists. There are the absolutists who tend to favor hereditary supreme rule, and there are those who think the ideal form of government is close to what Great Britain has right now (a democracy paired with a monarch who serves a ceremonial role as head of state).\n\nFor many, monarchy offers up an alternative to other radical political factions. \u201cI had a [real] disdain for liberalism and democracy in general,\u201d an absolute monarchist from Germany told me on Reddit. \u201cAt first I actually identified with [Nazism] given my family\u2019s history (cringe, I know) then I ditched that and was looking for something that really suited me and absolutism did just that, which led to monarchism by reading many works from respected authors.\u201d\n\nFor an American monarchist like Sean, his preferred system of government \u201cis some manner of elective monarchy modeled to a degree after what you saw in the Holy Roman Empire\u201d, he told me. \u201cThe individual governor of each of the 50 states could vote amongst themselves on a new monarch in the event of an emperor stepping down \u2026 One of the reasons that I, and many others, favor monarchy, has to do with the benefits that a single individual can have when it comes to matters of foreign policy, international relations, international trade, et cetera.\u201d\n\nOthers were drawn to monarchy more explicitly because of Trump. One self-identified American semi-constitutionalist explained: \u201cI always had some monarchist sympathies, but I went full turncoat when I saw how moronically people were treating politics after 2016 and realized that our current system was breeding a bunch of nutjobs. After that I became convinced that a monarch or something is needed to keep politicians and the like in check.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\u201cHistorical amnesia,\u201d Sean Yom, an associate professor of political science at Temple University told me, when I asked him what might possess someone to become a monarchist in 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s a collective amnesia about how bad certain kinds of political systems really were.\u201d Yom specifically studies contemporary Middle Eastern monarchies, and noted that many of the participants in the subreddit seemed to be \u201cfrom fairly developed western countries where the notion of monarchism wrapped largely in warm historical overtones\u201d.\n\nIn 2018, the New York Times cited a study conducted by a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, which discovered \u201c\u2018robust and quantitatively meaningful evidence\u2019 that monarchies outperform other forms of government\u201d, and provide nations with \u201cstability that often translates into economic gains\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nostalgia,\u201d Mauro Guillen, the Wharton professor who conducted the study, told me when I asked him why monarchy would appeal to a modern-day American or German. \u201cThey like the pomp and circumstance,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re traditionalists, and they like something that provides continuity.\u201d He also pointed out that Hollywood, and specifically Disney, with its famous princesses, has been culturally influential when it comes to the public perception of a monarchical government.\n\nBut the simple yearning for stability is a big reason why people who are not octogenarian royals are embracing this form of government. \u201cWhen I was younger I thought monarchy was stupid and made no sense, like most children who were raised on republican (not the American political party) propaganda,\u201d one Reddit user explained to me. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a specific moment when I thought for the first time, \u2018monarchy is the best form of government,\u2019 it was just a gradual change. Why am I a monarchist? I\u2019m a monarchist because I believe that monarchy produces a stable government and unites a people, it produces leaders who were taught from birth to lead.\u201d", "description": "Some are searching for a return to tradition, some are yearning for stability, while for others the rise of Trump is the spur", "authors": ["Eve Peyser"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d563450700aeea16eaf3c85f71fab7c17545673/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26e57e56675df3b63d22b34c353c9820", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
