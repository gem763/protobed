Per filings obtained by Vulture, the lawsuit alleges that Weinstein conspired with the two attorneys, as well as spy agency Black Cube, to \u201csuppress and discredit\u201d McGowan\u2019s rape claim. \u201cThis case is about a diabolical and illegal effort by one of America\u2019s most powerful men and his representatives to silence sexual-assault victims. And it is about the courageous women and journalists who persisted to reveal the truth,\u201d the suit states. \u201cMcGowan has suffered tremendously from the defendant\u2019s conspiracy and lies. Her book sales suffered; her expenses mounted; her job opportunities vanished; and her emotional health cratered. She has experienced trauma and depression from the defendants\u2019 actions, and the deep betrayal will have life-long effects.\u201d\n\nIn the lawsuit, McGowan claims that when Weinstein got wind of her plans to detail the alleged 1997 rape in her memoir, he, among other actions, tried to buy her silence, steal the manuscript, and hire someone from the Black Cube agency to infiltrate her inner circle to record their conversations. (Which the operative successfully did.) In response to the suit, Weinstein\u2019s lawyer said McGowan is a \u201cpublicity seeker looking for money.\u201d\n\nIn September, an excerpt from Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey\u2019s book, She Said, revealed that Bloom, a prominent victims\u2019-rights attorney, was hired by Weinstein to discredit McGowan\u2019s story. \u201cI feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them,\u201d Bloom wrote in a particularly damning memo. \u201cWe can place an article re: her becoming increasingly unglued so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she\u2019s discredited.\u201d Bloom later confirmed that the memos featured in She Said were legitimate. She also apologized, \u201cespecially to the women,\u201d for her short stint as a Weinstein employee.", "description": "Rose McGowan is suing Harvey Weinstein, David Boies, and Lisa Bloom.
