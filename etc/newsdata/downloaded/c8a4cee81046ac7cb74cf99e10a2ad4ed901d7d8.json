On top of the lower valuation, the company\u2019s S-1 filing changed its corporate governance structure, including limiting the voting power of CEO Adam Neumann, as well as removed a clause that allowed Neumann\u2019s wife, Rebekah, to choose his successor should he step down.\n\nFor some investors, this is a sign to steer clear of the company\u2019s impending public offering.\n\n\u201cWell, if you take a step back, it's really what's broader going on in the IPO market, and I think this all started with Uber and Lyft,\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities told Yahoo Finance. \u201cFrom a valuation perspective,\u201d Ives said, the company\u2019s steep losses are a red flag for investors. \u201cI think WeWork's really become the poster child\u201d for problematic tech IPOs, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough year for IPOs, with Uber, Lyft, and Slack\u2019s (WORK) stock \u2014 all one-time unicorns \u2014 and all on steady declines since going public. Investors are pumping capital into companies whose business models are foreign and not proven in the public markets, as evidenced by Uber\u2019s (UBER) billion-dollar losses quarter after quarter. Another example: Slack recently posted losses more than 10 times larger than before its IPO.\n\n\u201cIt's not just WeWork,\u201d Ives said. \u201cIt's others that are viewing this because it just speaks to what we're seeing in the IPO market. It's definitely a fork in the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see some of these names like Zoom (ZM), Beyond Meat (BYND) \u2013 strong business models. You see the stocks going accordingly. Others, especially if you look at Uber and Lyft (LYFT), those have really become the poster child for what we're seeing,\u201d he said.\n\nGraphic by David Foster/Yahoo Finance More\n\nWeWork\u2019s business model is hinged on a fickle business \u2014 real estate. It also uses short-term leases, usually no longer than 15 months, for its spaces, creating constant customer turnover. The company hasn\u2019t shown that it has solved any of its problems, posting yearly losses of $1.9 billion in 2018 and hourly losses of $217,000.\n\nWeWork\u2019s IPO roadshow kicks off next week in anticipation of its IPO on Sept. 23.\n\n\u201cThey've got to prove to investors that, ultimately, there is a path here not just to profitability but growth. When you look at a lot of these other issues, I think the tolerance that you're seeing in this market is reduced in terms of what investors are willing to kind of look past,\u201d Ives said. \u201cAnd that's what we've seen in a lot of these other IPOs is that now you're on the other side of the cycle. I think investors are starting to basically say right here, like, they're not going to just invest based on sort of a hope and a prayer.\u201d\n\nAshley is a Production Assistant for Yahoo Finance.
