Fruits: All kinds of berries! They are loaded with antioxidants, full of fibre and low in calories. Some of the other seasonal fruits that I love in summer are mangoes, oranges, kiwis and watermelon. Vegetables: Green leaves such spinach and rocket, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and pumpkin. Proteins: I'm consuming a lot more plant-based meals lately and I've been enjoying tofu and legumes as my main source of plant-based protein. Tuna, chicken and turkey breast are my top three animal protein because they are super versatile and economical. You can make an awesome nourish bowl or burrito bowl with any of these protein sources. Fats: My healthy fats don't vary much between the hot and cold seasons, I normally consume lots of peanut butter, avocado, raw nuts, and extra virgin olive oil.\n\n'In warmer months, people tend to be more conscious of their food choices and go for lighter meals, which is fantastic but, at the same time, I'd recommend to include foods that you love, so that you're more likely to enjoy the process and keep meal prepping in the long term,' Angela told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'Include some nourishing and substantial salads, some seasonal fruits and some delicious snacks like chia puddings, parfaits or brownies if you feel like it.\n\n'Every food is good if consumed with moderation, even chocolate.'\n\nWith summer fast approaching, Angela - who documents her vibrant food @the_healthy_diary_ said you can prepare healthy foods without cutting out anything.\n\n'When building your meal, half the plate should be non-starchy vegetables, quarter of the plate should be a protein source and the remaining quarter, a source of wholegrain cereal,' she said.\n\n'Non-starchy vegetables will be your best friend when trying to eat substantial meals without adding extra calories. To give you an idea, a cup of zucchini is only 17 calories and it's filled with fiber and nutrients that we need for good health.\n\n'Also, when making sweet meals for breakfast or snacks, add lots of berries as these are low in calories, high in antioxidants and extremely nutritious. Strawberries will also provide you with lots of Vitamin C.\n\n'We don't have to compromise the size or flavor of our meals, we just need to be smarter with our food choices and read labels to have an idea of the nutritional value of the products we are purchasing.'\n\nShe follows an 80/20 rule where 80 per cent are made up of wholesome foods and 20 per cent can be anything from chocolates and ice creams to burgers and pizzas\n\nWhat her weekly meal prep looks like: Breakfast: Chocolate and berry overnight oats, omelettes and pancakes. Morning snack: Apples, strawberries with almond butter. Lunch: Chickpeas gyros bowl. Afternoon snack: Yoghurt\n\nBurrito bowl: Mince beef, sweet potatoes, corn, cheese lettuce, cucumber, and coriander\n\nHow to make the perfect summer salad Angela said her favourite summer dishes are salads. 'Salads don't have to be boring,' she said. 'This is a good rule of thumb when creating a salad: Add a source of protein - tuna, chicken, tofu or legumes\n\nAdd a source of carbohydrates - wholegrain pasta, rice or quinoa\n\nTwo to three serves of vegetables - a cup of green leaves, carrots, cherry tomatoes, zucchini or cucumber\n\nA source of healthy fats like avocado, olives, feta cheese\n\nAnd salad dressing, which could simply be olive oil with lemon juice or balsamic dressing\n\nTo create flavoursome dishes that are not calorie dense, Angela said there are many things you can do boost flavour.\n\n'Using lots of spices to season your meals and, if possible, let your protein - whether it's chicken or tofu - marinate the night prior so it absorbs all the flavour,' she said.\n\n'I also think that texture is super important, so adding some sort of crunch to your meals will create a more enjoyable eating experience.\n\n'I'd recommend crispy chickpeas, crunchy noodles or even just crunchy veggies like cucumber and asparagus.\n\n'Having fun with your foods, experimenting and trying new things is very important. Meal prepping is also about trial and error and finding out what you like or dislike in the process.'\n\nTo keep her meal prepping under two hours, she always puts together simple dishes for lunch that doesn't require any cooking.\n\n'I like to include at least one salad to my weekly prep. Like a Mediterranean tuna salad for example, which may take five minutes to put together. My second lunch option may be a little more complex but still fairly simple,' she said.\n\n'For my snacks in the warmer season I will normally include a serve of fruit with peanut butter or Greek yoghurt. I also love to bake every now and then and the recipes I go for are simple and quick, such as muffins, brownies or oatmeal bake.\n\nEvery Sunday, Angela spends two hours in the kitchen preparing a week's worth of meals\n\nBreakfast: Vanilla and berry overnight oats. Morning snack: Apple and almonds, strawberries with protein bars. Lunch: Moroccan chicken and quinoa salad\n\nLunch options: Warm pumpkin and beetroot salad - which includes roasted beetroot, onion, feta cheese and walnuts and pumpkin marinated in maple syrup\n\nWhile she prepares all her breakfast, lunches and snacks once a week, she prefers to cook her dinner every night.\n\n'I don't normally prep for dinner as I prefer to cook these fresh every night,' she said.\n\nDepending on the seasonal produce she uses to cook with, Angela said her meals can cost anywhere between $3 to $7.\n\n'A plant-based meal with legumes, for example, will be around the $3 mark. If you make a tuna salad, it will be around the $4 to $5 mark and a chicken or beef-based meal will be around the $5 to $7 mark,' she said.\n\n'You most definitely can create your meal plan based on your budget. Eating healthy foods shouldn't be expensive and there are heaps of options in the market for every budget, including frozen, odd and seasonal fruits and vegetables.'\n\nMorning snack: Berry mix with choc chips. Two lunch options: Veggie lentil lettuce cups with quinoa - and Moroccan chicken salad with couscous. Afternoon snack: Apples and yoghurt and homemade choc crunch\n\nWhile she prepares all her breakfast, lunches and snacks once a week, she prefers to cook her dinner every night\n\nShe also has a meal prep bag to store all her daily meals for work\n\nFor anyone who's keen to meal prep, Angela said: 'I've learned that being organised is key if you want to start or maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\n'Meal prepping will help you stay on track and avoid overeating. It will also save you heaps of time and money,' she said.\n\n'It doesn't mean that you will have to eat the same every day and it should be tailored to your lifestyle.\n\n'Some people may want to prep for the whole week as they are busy full-time workers, others may only want to prep for two to three days, so it should really fit each person's lifestyles.\n\n'Meal prepping doesn't have to be boring. You can add some fun foods here and there and make sure that whatever you are prepping for the week is exciting and delicious.'", "description": "Nutrition coach Angela Martin, from Melbourne, has shared her\u00a0meal prepping secrets for summer, including her go-to ingredients and her favourite meals to cook over the warmer months.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/00/19814080-0-image-a-38_1571269549053.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
