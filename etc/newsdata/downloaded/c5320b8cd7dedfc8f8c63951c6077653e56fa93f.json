Greg Abbott\u2019s paralyzed from the waist down during #TribFest19, an annual political gathering put on by the Texas Tribune in Austin every year:\n\nAt #TribFest19 panel on progressive activism, @JudgeEckhardt, talking about #txlege overriding local ordinances like Austin\u2019s tree ordinance, says Gov.

Then I said something disagreeable,\u201d Eckhardt said in statement late Friday. \u201cI want to apologize to Governor Abbott. I made a flippant comment that was inappropriate. The comment did nothing to further the debate I was participating in, much less further the political discourse in our community, state, and nation. While the Governor and I disagree on a number of issues, that is no excuse to be disagreeable.\u201d\n\nIt will be interesting to see if she can survive this, because it was way out of line:\n\nThis is an unbelievably distasteful comment from @JudgeEckhardt. She should immediately apologize to Governor @GregAbbott_TX and the @texasdemocrats should condemn her statement. https://t.co/YBdsGGubO0 \u2014 Texas GOP (@TexasGOP) September 28, 2019\n\nAbsolutely classless comment! @GovAbbott is a shining example to all Texans of someone who overcame adversity with a smile, a LOT of hard work, and a positive attitude. https://t.co/WFGfLFPfH1 \u2014 Kelly Hancock (@KHancock4TX) September 27, 2019\n\nWhat an unbelievably stupid thing to say about @GovAbbott or anyone. Taking steps to lessen the negative consequences of Austin\u2019s nutball policy-making is hardly a basis to attack the Governor for a tragic injury which he has demonstrated steadfast determination to overcome. https://t.co/ha1tn82ILs \u2014 Chip Roy (@chiproytx) September 27, 2019\n\n***\n\nRelated:\n\nGov.
