Results described as 'spectacular' showed the rats' damaged myelin made an almost complete recovery after three weeks on metformin.\n\nAnother key milestone has been the discovery of treatments which may to protect nerves from damage.\n\nThis includes the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins. They are currently being tested in the biggest ever trial for secondary progressive MS.\n\nWHAT IS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS? Multiple sclerosis (known as MS) is a condition in which the immune system attacks the body and causes nerve damage to the brain and spinal cord. It is an incurable, lifelong condition. Symptoms can be mild in some, and in others more extreme causing severe disability. MS affects 2.3 million people worldwide - including around 400,000 in the US, and 100,000 in the UK. It is more than twice as common in women as it is in men. A person is usually diagnosed in their 20s and 30s. The condition is more commonly diagnosed in people of European ancestry. The cause isn't clear. There may be genes associated with it, but it is not directly hereditary. Smoking and low vitamin D levels are also linked to MS. Symptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking, vision problems, bladder problems, numbness or tingling, muscle stiffness and spasms, problems with balance and co-ordination, and problems with thinking, learning and planning. The majority of sufferers will have episodes of symptoms which go away and come back, while some have ones which get gradually worse over time. Symptoms can be managed with medication and therapy. The condition shortens the average life expectancy by around five to 10 years.\n\nThe \u00a36million project, which will be funded by the NHS National Institute for Health Research and the MS Society, offers hope of the first effective treatment for patients with secondary progressive MS \u2013 an advanced stage of the illness.\n\nIn the early stages, patients normally experience \u2018relapsing-remitting MS\u2019, where their condition gets worse and then stabilises in fits and starts.\n\nAround half of those patients develop secondary progressive MS within 15 to 20 years.\n\nAt this stage there is no let-up in their decline and they progressively lose muscular function and become more disabled.\n\nScientists hoping to cure the disorder within the decade have joined a Stop MS appeal by the MS Society, which needs to raise \u00a3100 million over a ten year period to accelerate new research.\n\nProfessor Anna Williams, an expert in regenerative neurology at the MS Society Centre for MS Research at the University of Edinburgh, said the 10-year commitment was 'not to be taken lightly'.\n\nShe added: 'MS is a serious condition that can affect every aspect of your life, and the Stop MS Appeal will bring immense hope to millions of people affected.\n\n'For a national charity and professionals like myself to come out and say we believe it can be stopped, we must be able to deliver on that promise.'\n\nThe Stop MS Appeal launches publicly this week with a major advertising campaign.\n\nThe money raised will pay for new research and MS clinical trials network, which is currently being developed by leading clinicians and scientists bought together by the MS Society.\n\nThis trial will allow researchers to test many potential drugs simultaneously, saving time and money.\n\nNick Moberly, chief executive at the MS Society, said: 'Research has got us to a critical point, and we can see a future where nobody needs to worry about MS getting worse.\n\n'That means not living in fear you'll be reliant on a wheelchair, or one day lose your independence entirely.\n\n'The worldwide MS community is coming together to help us achieve our ambitious goal to stop MS. But we need to act now, because people with MS can't wait.'", "description": "MS is thought to affect 100,000 people in the UK, with 14 patients being diagnosed every day.
