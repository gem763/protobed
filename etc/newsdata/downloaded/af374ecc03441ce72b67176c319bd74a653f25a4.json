That year, 1,517 complaints were logged.\n\nMr Lang said: \u201cThere\u2019s a financial incentive to use substandard food. What we\u2019re seeing here is a new, more sophisticated crime occuring and being normalised. It\u2019s the normalisation of this crime, which is the worrying thing.\n\n\u201cIf you have a beyond the sell by date or a meat that is going off and you cut out the bad bits and just put the rest of it through the mincer, you\u2019ve got an opportunity to add value to something that otherwise is worthless.\u201d\n\nThe crime reports often relate to chemicals included in food supplements.\n\nFor example, these could include DNP, a toxic chemical which is sometimes sold as a weight-loss aid, or a so-called magic mineral solution, which has a range of alleged health benefits but is unsafe for human consumption.\n\nThe hike in complaints could be partly because a greater number of these products are sold online, making them easier to get hold of.\n\nOther criminal cases could involve using products different from what is claimed on packaging.\n\nThere have been 364 calls relating to mislabelling products or replacing some ingredients for cheaper alternatives among other concerns, in the first three months of 2019 alone.\n\nFor example, one industry source said that to make black pudding, some grocers import blood from eastern Europe and dilute it with water in Britain, before turning it into a breakfast item which they say is \u201cproduced in the UK\u201d.\n\nMalcolm Harrison, the boss of the CIPS, said: \u201cBusinesses must ensure that supply chains are transparent and that goods can be tracked from their source. It is important to visit suppliers and introduce regular quality and compliance checks to ensure sound international supply chain practices.\u201d\n\nTesco came under fire three years ago for coming up with fictional British-sounding farm names, such as Boswell Farms and Rosedene Farms, on its cheaper ranges of fresh produce, some of which were sourced from abroad.\n\nWaitrose also had to rebrand some of its \u201cBritish\u201d range ready meals because a proportion were made with New Zealand lamb.\n\nReports, however, are not automatically offences and multiple complaints may be received for one incident.\n\nDarren Davies, the head of the National Food Crime Unit, said: \u201cWe work to protect consumers from criminal conduct. We would encourage anyone who believes they have knowledge of food fraud being committed to contact us.\u201d\n\nSome food producers are up in arms about prospective trade deals with the likes of the US and Australia, which by opening up competition to larger, cheaper producers could dent profits and lower the standards, they argue.", "description": "Food unfit for human consumption is increasingly making its way onto the shelves of shops as a wave of mislabelled products enters the supply chain.", "authors": ["Laura Onita", "Retail Correspondent", "Charles Moore"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/06/16/horsemeat-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpJliwavx4coWFCaEkEsb3kvxIt-lGGWCWqwLa_RXJU8.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
