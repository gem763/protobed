The company said it would try to sell what it called noncore assets over the next year to 18 months, bringing in between $500 million and $1 billion in proceeds.\n\nShares of Alcoa rose 6% in after-hours trading but have fallen 28% so far this year through Wednesday.\n\nOver a five-year period, Alcoa plans to consider a range of further asset sales and closures of facilities, as well as curtailing production at other sites. It said it would review 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity and 4 million metric tons of alumina-refining capacity\n\nThe company has been hurt by fears that a weaker global economy will cut into demand for its products and crimp prices for metals. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said it expects growth of 3% this year, lower than its forecast from July and off close to 1 percentage point compared with 2017.\n\nGlobal demand for aluminum in 2019 will be weaker than Alcoa previously expected, the company also said Wednesday, rising no more than 0.4% and falling up to 0.6%. Earlier, it said it believed demand for the metal would rise up to 2.3% this year.\n\n\"The change is driven by weakening macroeconomic conditions, trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and contracting manufacturing activity, especially in the global automotive sector,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nQuarterly revenue at Alcoa fell 24% from a year earlier to $2.57 billion as aluminum prices declined. Its average selling price of $2,138 a metric ton for aluminum in the latest quarter was down 13% compared with the year-ago period.\n\nAlcoa reported a quarterly loss of $221 million, or $1.19 a share, wider than the loss of $6 million, or 3 cents a share, recorded in the year-ago period. After adjustments, the company reported a loss of 44 cents a share, worse than what analysts polled by FactSet expected.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThis item was corrected at 5:50 p.m. ET to show that Alcoa believes global aluminum demand may range from a gain of 0.4% and a decline of 0.6% this year. An earlier version of this story said the company believed demand could fall between 0.4% and 0.6%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 16, 2019 17:29 ET (21:29 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
