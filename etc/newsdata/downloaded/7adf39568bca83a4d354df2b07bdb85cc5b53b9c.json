I stopped moisturising so my skin would go dry and dusty and I'd look lighter for school.\n\n\"I scratched white lines into my skin, too, to try and look whiter.\n\n\"People stare at me and touch my hair without asking too.\n\n\"It just makes me feel sad and angry.\"\n\n(Image: Colleen Robinson /SWNS.COM)\n\nDevastated Mum Colleen said the abuse is not just in the playground.\n\nShe said: \"I had a new-born in a pram. I told the kids to keep walking, that the men were making noises because mummy looks silly.\n\n\"Fin said, 'I know they were making the noises at me because I look like a monkey'.\n\n\u201cIt seems Brexit has given everyone an excuse to bring out their worst side.\n\n\"We want to leave but my husband has a business down here so it isn\u2019t as easy as that. One boy who is 13 has been prosecuted.\n\n\"I went to his mum and told her I was going to the police and she said that she was glad because he\u2019s out of control.\n\n\"I'm just sick of people not evolving. It's like going back in time.\"\n\n(Image: Colleen Robinson /SWNS.COM)\n\nShe is calling for more black history teaching in Cornish schools in a bid to combat racial intolerance.\n\nShe said: \"There\u2019s very little racial diversity here so it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to hide away and get on with it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping by speaking out that others who are the victims of racial abuse down here will stand up and know they\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nBut despite the years of abuse Finley has recently starting to learn the ukulele in the hope of one day being able to hold a music festival promoting racial diversity in Cornwall.\n\nHe said: \"I like being mixed race. It's when people are racist to me I don't like it, it makes me feel I don't fit in.\"", "description": "Finley\u00a0Sullivan, from Par, Cornwall, has been repeatedly taunted by cruel classmates who have told him to 'go home to Africa'", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Olive Loveridge-Greene", "Image", "Colleen Robinson", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572428.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_RACISM_MESSAGE_06_-_Copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
