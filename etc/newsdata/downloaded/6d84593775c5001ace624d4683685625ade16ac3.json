This comes after the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission said her extended tenure in September was illegal, according to its laws.\n\n\u201cThe minister argues that it is legal to extend Ms Myeni\u2019s term on the basis of Section 13.4.6 of the SAA Memorandum of Incorporation, which he says is in line with the Companies Act,\u201d SCOF chair Yunus Carrim said in a statement last week.\n\nInternational rating agencies are keeping a close watch on how Gigaba handles the SAA crisis, said Lees. He added Gigaba's reluctance to act decisively to put SAA into business rescue and on the road to either privatisation or liquidation will very likely have a negative effect on the 9.3 million unemployed South Africans.\n\n", "description": "The SAA board's delay in presenting its annual financial statements may be a ploy to help President Jacob Zuma keep his close friend Dudu Myeni on the SAA board, says the DA's Alf Lees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1891/0dff05b043a0491ba6b74641dc906fe2.jpg", "published_at": "2017-09-25"}
