However, when she bit into the wrap, Jade claims her throat started to swell and she broke out in hives.\n\nJade, from Garston, Liverpool, said: 'As soon as I bit into the wrap, I tasted tomato straight away.\n\n'At first I was panicking, I had been to the walk-in centre the day before and was on oxygen as my allergies can trigger my asthma.\n\n'When I bit into the tomato, I didn't know if my airwaves would become blocked and my eyes would start to puff.\n\n'I felt a tingling sensation, like an itch in the back of my throat which was swelling.\n\n'That's when my boyfriend started to say that my face had gone bright red and had also started swelling.'\n\nJade said that if she hadn't taken an antihistamine that morning, her reaction could have been more severe.\n\nWhen she went to confront the manager of the branch, she claims she was told that there was 'nothing they could do'.\n\nJade said: 'I would have had to use my epipen and potentially go to A&E if it got any worse.\n\n'I was offered a refund and a replacement of my meal, but this isn't good enough.'\n\nThe teenager claims it's not the first time she has suffered an allergic reaction after McDonald's crew members added tomato to her order.\n\nA McDonald's spokesperson said: 'We'd like to apologize to this customer for their experiences with this restaurant. All staff in the restaurant have been reminded of the procedure to take when serving a customer with allergens. The customer is currently in contact with our customer services team in order to find a resolution.' (Jade Davies pictured above)\n\nJade said: 'On September 8, I ordered a wrap and asked for no tomato, but they put it on.'\n\nShe emailed McDonald's customer service, who apologised for the incident, offered a \u00a35 voucher and said 'we are confident that you will see improvements on future visits'.\n\nJade said: 'They said there would be 'improvements on our future visit' yet it happened again.\n\n'I just want to raise awareness, all I want is to say to people to start checking their food, there needs to be something done about it as they are not doing enough.\n\nThe teenager claims it's not the first time she has suffered an allergic reaction after McDonald's crew members added tomato to her order. Jade said: 'On September 8, I ordered a wrap and asked for no tomato, but they put it on.' (receipt shown above from September showing a request for no tomato highlighted)\n\n'I'm starting to worry now when I eat, I have to check the food. I don't know whether I would take the risk to go back.'\n\nA McDonald's spokesperson said: 'We'd like to apologize to this customer for their experiences with this restaurant.\n\n'We have a number of procedures in place to avoid inaccurate orders and are disappointed that these were not followed.\n\n'All staff in the restaurant have been reminded of the procedure to take when serving a customer with allergens.\n\n'The customer is currently in contact with our customer services team in order to find a resolution.'", "description": "Jade Davies said she ordered the McDonald's wrap in Speke, Liverpool.
