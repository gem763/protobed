A previous version of this video misstated the age when Buttigieg was elected mayor. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Pete Buttigieg said Tuesday that he raised more than $19.1 million during the last three months, a decline from the whopping $24.8 million his presidential campaign collected during the second quarter but still a healthy haul.\n\nThe fundraising will add to his staying power as the previously little-known mayor of South Bend, Ind., tries to break into the top tier of Democratic contenders in the polls.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he'd collected $25.3 million, an increase from the last quarter.\n\nAfter raising the most money in the Democratic field in the second quarter, Buttigieg ranked behind only Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in total fundraising. But he lags behind both senators and behind former Vice President Joe Biden in public polling.\n\n\"We will have the resources to go the full distance, and to win, the 2020 nominating contests,\" campaign manager Mike Schmuhl said in the announcement.\n\nAll the candidates haven't announced their fundraising totals for a quarter that typically can be less lucrative than other times of the year. Figures don't have to be publicly disclosed until filed with the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15, the night of the next Democratic debate.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg speaks during a campaign stop at the Alliant Energy Amphitheater in Dubuque on Monday, Sept. 23, 2019.

He now has more than 220 campaign aides in states that will be casting the first ballots in the nominating contest, according to his campaign.\n\nHe\u2019s run two television ads in Iowa in which he\u2019s depicted himself as a pragmatist offering solutions that won\u2019t further divide the country.\n\n\"As a veteran, and as a mayor, I\u2019ve seen what we can achieve when we have each other\u2019s backs,\" he says in one ad. \"We need real solutions, not more polarization.\"\n\nWarren led the field in the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, with 22% of likely Democratic caucusgoers saying she is their first choice for president.\n\nBiden was second with 20% and Sanders at third with 11% in the poll conducted Sept. 14-18.\n\nButtigieg followed the three leaders as the favorite of 9% of poll respondents.\n\nThat's below the 14% support he drew in Iowa in June. But just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers told pollsters in September that their minds are made up, illustrating the fluidity in the race.\n\nButtigieg's campaign emphasized how much his national support has grown since entering the race at the beginning of the year. The number of donors has increased from fewer than 200,000 in the first quarter to more than 580,000 today, according to the campaign. The average donation is about $40.\n\nTop fundraising moments for the past few months include the July and September debates, a lottery for contributors to win \"pizza with Pete,\" and a final push at the end of the quarter that included the first fundraising solicitation written by his mother and an appeal sent out an hour before the deadline.\n\nInteractive guide: Who is running for president in 2020?\n\n2020 Democratic candidates 8.28.19 (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/01/pete-buttigieg-third-quarter-fundraising-shows-staying-power-dem-race/3824544002/", "description": "Pete Buttigieg continues to raise the money he'll need to stay in the race as he tries to break into the top tier of Democratic presidential candidates.", "authors": ["Maureen Groppe", "Published A.M.
