It is tempting to call the upcoming national election on September 17 a referendum on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now Israel's longest-serving leader, who faces corruption charges (all of which he denies). Perhaps because of these legal troubles, alongside his fear that smaller right-wing parties will siphon off votes from his Likud Party, Netanyahu has now declared that if he remains prime minister after the elections, he will annex the Jordan Valley and all settlements, pending consultation with the United States.\n\nDennis Ross\n\nDavid Makovsky\n\nThis is not an act of leadership. Instead, it is a political act designed to appeal to the settler movement, which constitutes the backbone of Netanyahu's party. By boosting Likud's fortunes in this way, Netanyahu seeks to ensure that Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin, will come to him first to try to form the government. (While having largely ceremonial powers, Israel's president is nonetheless the one who determines after an election who should be asked to try to form the governing coalition. Traditionally, after canvassing all the parties, the Israeli president asks the leader whose party received the most votes or at least seems most able to form a government.) Should Netanyahu remain as prime minister and actually implement this policy, the possibility of allowing a separate sovereignty to Palestinians, thereby preserving the chance for a two-state solution in the future, would be lost.\n\nIn announcing his new plans for annexation, Netanyahu is putting politics before country. In our new book, \"Be Strong and of Good Courage,\" we profile four Israeli prime ministers -- David Ben-Gurion, Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon. All of these men were, of course, capable of making shrewd political maneuvers. But their view of leadership meant that when they faced fateful decisions, they put their country first -- even when they knew what the costs and political backlash might be.\n\nNot surprisingly, while these four did not share an ideology -- and Ben-Gurion and Begin were even bitter enemies -- they had a common view of leadership and responsibility. Sharon talked about the \"solitude of the leader,\" and how leaders must bear the burden and the weight of their decision-making. He and these other three men understood this duty. They were mindful not just of the costs of acting, but also of the consequences of not acting.\n\nThey saw the stakes clearly and were prepared to take on their own constituencies -- necessarily putting their country ahead of their political interests. (Take Sharon, who persisted in withdrawing from Gaza, even though his party voted in a referendum not to withdraw.) They all felt the need to lead their publics by clearly explaining their policy decisions. They understood when the moment required a difficult choice and were ready to step up.\n\nRead More", "description": "The question is not who can produce the best plan for two states right now; no on can for some time, write Dennis Ross and David Makovsky.
