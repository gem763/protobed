It's a fixed amount for a fixed period of time which results in it being fairly cheap to service.\n\n\"It's just under two per cent our annual revenue each year, so it doesn't really have any impact on us.\"\n\nIt is not just the Glazers that are under the spotlight, with Woodward's role subject to intense focus.\n\n\"I understand the scrutiny; it's part of the job,\" he told United We Stand.\n\n\"We have to do everything that we possibly can to get back to winning the Premier League.\n\n\"We are not successful until we do. Second is not success, we have to win the Premier League.\"", "description": "Man Utd have been owned by the Glazer family since 2005 but Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is said to be preparing a third bid", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20634085.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Everton-FC-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
