And we are doing so.\"\n\nThe vote would, in part, allow Nadler to call impeachment hearings, and allow staff members to question witnesses in those hearings.\n\nA fed up Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) tried to explain what was really going on.\n\n\"The Judiciary Committee has become a giant Instagram filter,\" he said. \"To make it appear that something\u2019s happening that is not.\"\n\nAfter 32 months of investigations that have produced no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump colluded with Russia to win in 2016, still Democrats are pursuing other avenues that could lead to impeachment.\n\nCollins has seen and heard a lot of in the past few years, but he is still shocked by his colleagues' willingness to grant their staffers so much responsibility.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never seen a majority of members who desperately want to give their authority to staff members,\" he noted.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) had a similar message. He was frustrated that in the past 48 hours, the committee has voted to strip Americans of their Second Amendment rights, and to try and impeach the duly elected president.\n\nDemocrats on the House Judiciary Committee:\n\n\n\n-First voted to take away Americans' firearms\n\n-Then voted to impeach the guy we elected President\n\n\n\nAll in less than 48 hours. And you wonder why people can't stand this town. pic.twitter.com/4dJxW5vUbW \u2014 Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) September 12, 2019\n\nJordan surmised that the Democrats are \"trying to change the rules\" because so far they've hit nothing but dead ends.\n\n\"The Michael Cohen hearing was a flop,\" Jordan noted. \"The John Dean hearing was a flop. And everyone in the country knows the Bob Mueller hearing...that was a flop.\"\n\nBut, Jordan added, the Democrats won't give up because they've \"got to find something\" to get this president in trouble.\n\nMedia have noted that the impeachment inquiry has sparked confusion among Democrats, many of whom are nervous to vote on such a controversial topic in an election year.\n\nIn early August, Nadler publicly declared that his committee had already launched impeachment proceedings despite taking no formal vote to do so. The claim sparked confusion, even among some Democrats, who sought clarification as they faced questions from progressive constituents about the status of the House's effort to recommend Trump's removal from office. (Politico)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has attempted to put the brakes on all this impeachment talk, urging her colleagues to focus on other issues.", "description": ".09/12/2019 19:37:30PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/141/f764fc9c-cdb2-4c3d-aad9-484042f89feb.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
