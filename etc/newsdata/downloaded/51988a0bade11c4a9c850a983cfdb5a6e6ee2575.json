But in a new interview the former secretary of State suggests that the deplorable population of the United States may be much larger than she previously claimed.\n\nFor readers too young to remember the presidential election of 2016, a standard applause line for Mrs. Clinton when speaking to crowds of wealthy coastal donors involved expressing her disapproval of millions of her fellow Americans. Here\u2019s part of the transcript from one such event published by Time magazine in September of 2016:\n\nYou know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump\u2019s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?\n\n[Laughter/applause]\n\nThe racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic \u2014 you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up.\n\nSince then, Mrs. Clinton has at times expressed regret for such remarks and at other times hurled still more insults when describing people who chose not to vote for her. But until this week she seemed concerned mainly with accusing Republicans of moral failings.\n\nGet news and analysis on politics, policy, national security and more, delivered right to your inbox\n\nIn a new podcast interview with former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, Mrs. Clinton says she was surprised to find out in 2016 how many sexists there were in both parties. And Mrs. Clinton, who continues throughout the interview to cling to the discredited theory that Russian interference is partly responsible for her 2016 loss, claims that one of the Democrats now running for President will actually be used by both Republicans and Russians to swing the election.\n\n\n\nThe Journal\u2019s Ken Thomas writes:\n\nThe former secretary of state said this week in an interview with David Plouffe, a former Obama campaign manager, that President Trump is \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s dream.\u201d She said Republicans would attempt to boost a third-party candidate to help the president\u2019s re-election in key battleground states and implied that they would choose someone Russia would support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. A spokesman said she was referring to Republicans.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a favorite of the Russians,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of the Democratic candidate. \u201cThey have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nTo buy into the new Clinton conspiracy theory, it seems that one must also believe that American voters are not equipped to resist the power of fake news from Russia.\n\nPrevious efforts to present Russian online messages as decisive in the 2016 U.S. election have led to some laughable results. But Mrs. Clinton is keeping the faith that she was robbed in 2016 and insists this week that \u201ca lot more happened than has been admitted publicly.\u201d Despite the Mueller report\u2019s finding of no collusion, she suggests that President Trump is compromised. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Putin has on him, whether it\u2019s both personal and financial\u2014I assume it is,\u201d she tells Mr. Plouffe.\n\nBeyond the Russians, she talks about an effort by Trump 2020 campaign chief Brad Parscale to \u201cmanipulate more voters\u2019 minds.\u201d\n\nFor voters who tend to believe their minds are not so easily manipulated, Mrs. Clinton also offers a history lesson. She notes that the current impeachment effort will be more challenging than the Watergate inquiry she worked on as a young congressional aide, in part because of all the new media competition.\n\nBack in Nixon days there were just three commercial broadcast television networks, plus dominant newspapers. Now, she says, \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot harder for Americans to know what they\u2019re supposed to believe.\u201d\n\nShe tells the story of dealing with questions from reporter Sam Donaldson in the 1970s, rather than today\u2019s myriad online media competitors. \u201cIt was a much more controllable environment,\u201d she laments.\n\nOf course many Americans have known for a long time that they don\u2019t want a few media gatekeepers telling them what to believe. And they\u2019re skeptical of anyone trying to control their information environment.\n\nAs for Mrs. Clinton, her views on the subject may help explain the results of the 2016 election and her fears about 2020. Is she really concerned about the alleged ability of foreigners to manipulate voters\u2019 minds\u2014or about her own party\u2019s inability?\n\n***\n\nIn Other News\n\nAmerica\u2019s Greatest Imports \u201cImmigrants have been awarded nearly 40% of the Nobel Prizes won by Americans in Chemistry, Medicine and Physics since 2000.
