Travelers from the Americas are the most enthusiastic at 94% and 86% respectively, followed by travelers from Asia Pacific at 93% and 84%, and Europe at 89% and 77%.\n\n\u201cTraveling to a new destination, meeting someone face-to-face for the first time, networking with people that can help you to advance your business as well as your career, and getting out of the work routine are some of the most exciting factors associated to business travel according to our findings\u201d said Niklas Andr\u00e9en, Executive VP and Chief Traveler Experience Officer at CWT. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we recognize the true value that travelers find in their travels, and understand what provides the most positive benefits while on the road.\u201d\n\nCWT\u2019s research also shows that developing trust (39%), getting to know people better (32%), and efficiencies (31%) are the top three benefits of meeting with people in person for travelers worldwide.\n\nEuropean travelers value getting to know people the most (37%), followed by Americas (36%), and travelers from Asia Pacific (25%). Europeans also value the efficiencies of meeting people face-to-face the most (34%), followed by travelers from Asia Pacific (31%), and Americas (29%).\n\nBleisure Trends\n\nAnother perk of traveling for business is the possibility of extending a trip for pleasure. The average number of times in the past 12 months that the respondents have extended their trip is 2.4. Travelers from Americas took the lead with 2.7 times, followed by 2.4 in Europe, and 2.3 in Asia Pacific. The average number of days \u2013 globally \u2013 was 4.3 days.\n\nThe research also uncovered that companies are mostly supportive of Bleisure travel if employees pay for their personal expenses (76%), especially in Asia Pacific (79%) and the Americas (77%). Companies in Europe fell short at 70%.\n\nAbout the survey\n\nThe survey was created by CWT and conducted by Artemis Strategy Group between the 29th of January and the 9th of February, 2019.
