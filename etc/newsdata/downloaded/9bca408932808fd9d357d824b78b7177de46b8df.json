The subpoena, which instructs them to now appear next Wednesday, makes no mention of the federal indictment, which may complicate their ability or willingness to cooperate with the House\u2019s investigation.\n\nFacing criminal charges for work that appears to have at least some connection to the subject of the impeachment inquiry, they may choose to assert Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.\n\nIn a letter to John Dowd, the lawyer representing both men, three House committee chairmen wrote that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Furman were \u201crequired by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour clients are private citizens who are not employees of the Executive Branch. They may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry. They are required by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas. They are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance, and obstruction.\u201d\n\n[Read the letter from committee chairmen.]\n\nThe letter was written by Representatives Adam B. Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Eliot L. Engel of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Oversight Committee.\n\nHow anger over Syria could impact impeachment.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Representative John Shimkus, a veteran Illinois Republican who has announced he will not seek re-election, took to St. Louis talk radio to say, \u201cpull my name off the \u2018I support Donald Trump\u2019 list.\u201d (Five minutes and 18 seconds in.)\n\nIt was not because of the latest twist in the Ukraine scandal. He pointedly did not break from the president on impeachment. It was because of what he saw as Mr. Trump\u2019s abandonment of America\u2019s ally, Syria\u2019s Kurds, who are now under Turkish onslaught. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken,\u201d he told KMOX.\n\nWhy is that important? Republican anger over Syria may not translate directly into support for impeachment, but if more Republicans \u2014 especially among the 19 who have thus far announced their retirement \u2014 take their names off the \u201cI support Donald Trump\u201d list, they may not be available to man the barricades when the Democrats come to impeach.", "description": "House subpoenas two Giuliani associates who are tied to the Ukraine scandal \u2014 and who were arrested Wednesday and charged with campaign finance violations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/us/politics/10dc-impeachbriefing/10dc-impeachbriefing-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
