Buttigieg\u2019s team said their average contribution was $32, as 182,000 new people donated in Q3 to bring their total number of donors so far in the race to 580,000.\n\n\u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution,\u201d said the manager of the Sanders campaign, Faiz Shakir, in a news release on Tuesday.\n\nThe Sanders campaign also said his overall total haul for the White House contest now stands at $61.5 million, while Buttigieg\u2019s corresponding figure is $51 million. In the second quarter, Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., got $24.8 million in donations to lead the fundraising for that period, but Sanders had raised the most overall in the 2020 race as of the end of the second quarter.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s Q3 figures show that \u201cin a crowded field, Pete continues to stand out as having the vision and leadership voters know we need to tackle the urgent problems facing our country,\u201d said his campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, in a news release. \u201cIt also positions us solidly as one of the top three fundraisers in this race. We will have the resources to go the full distance, and to win, the 2020 nominating contests.\u201d\n\nA couple of Democratic contenders \u2014 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Housing and Urban Development chief Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 cautioned potential donors in recent days that the end of their campaigns could be nearing. But then on Monday, Booker said that he was staying in the 2020 race after achieving a fundraising goal tied to the end of the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a viable path forward, so I\u2019m staying in this race because I know we can win it,\u201d tweeted Booker, who ranks ninth among the 2020 Democrats in the latest RealClearPolitics average of polls, with 1.5% support.\n\nThe campaign manager for Castro, who is eighth in the average of polls with 1.7% support, later played down his warning as \u201cunfortunately hyperbolic writing in a fundraising email.\u201d\n\nThe third quarter\u2019s final days were highlighted by a flurry of fundraising around House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s campaign said it and the Republican National Committee raised $5 million in the 24 hours following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s launch of the inquiry, with supporters contributing to an \u201cImpeachment Defense Task Force.\u201d\n\nDemocratic campaigns\u2019 fundraising requests tied to the impeachment effort included one from former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who asked for donations in an email that stressed that he has supported impeachment since 2017. And California Sen. Kamala Harris asked for money to fight back amid \u201cattacks on anyone who supports impeachment.\u201d\n\nTo make the November debate, Democratic candidates must have at least 165,000 unique donors, as well as hit 3% support in at least four national or early state polls \u2014 or 5% in two early state polls. The total number of the party\u2019s White House hopefuls remains at a still-high level of 19, even after a handful of politicians have dropped out of the race for the 2020 nomination.", "description": "Presidential campaigns are starting to reveal their fundraising totals for the third quarter ahead of an Oct. 15 deadline, when figures must be disclosed to...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS246_2020_e_ZG_20190927145211.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
