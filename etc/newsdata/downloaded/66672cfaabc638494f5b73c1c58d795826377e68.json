Gavin Newsom (D) said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ll hold the line in court to defend our children\u2019s health, save consumers money at the pump and protect our environment.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit argues that Trump\u2019s administration is acting in violation of several environmental laws, including by preempting state law without congressional authority and by \u201cfailing to assess or analyze the damage\u201d the preemption \u201cwould inflict on the environment and public health.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has now filed 60 lawsuits on behalf of the state against the Trump administration, said legal precedent is on the side of California.\n\n\u201cTwo courts have already upheld California\u2019s emissions standards, rejecting the argument the Trump Administration resurrects to justify its misguided Preemption Rule,\u201d he said of the rule the federal government is invoking to crack down on state laws. \u201cYet, the Administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency, his office noted, has awarded the waiver to California 100 times over the last 50 years. With that legal authority, the powerful state has influenced fuel standards around the country \u2015 and even in Canada \u2015 in an effort to cut back on the greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change.\n\nMinutes after Trump confirmed his plans Wednesday to revoke the waiver, California officials told reporters they planned to file a lawsuit as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThis is the fight of a lifetime for us,\u201d California Air Resources Board Chairwoman Mary Nichols said Wednesday. \u201cWe have to win this.\u201d\n\nBecerra echoed her urgency at that same press conference.\n\n\u201cFor us, this is about survival,\u201d he said. \u201cOur communities are screaming for help to address the climate crisis. Unlike the Trump administration, we don\u2019t run scared.\u201d", "description": "Twenty-three other states have joined in on the lawsuit over auto emissions standards.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d84fed52100005d00d4a8c6.jpeg?cache=gm6focxpfi&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
