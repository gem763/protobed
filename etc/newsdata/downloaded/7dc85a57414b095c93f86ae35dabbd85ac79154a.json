U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were flat at $1,495.70 per ounce.\n\n\u201cOverall, gold is consolidating at the bottom of its medium-term range, implying that the next move is down assuming the mini trade deal goes through,\u201d OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.\n\nHalley pointed to a lot of stale long positions and said a breakdown through $1,460.00 is likely to see more long-term holders unwind their positions to lock in profit.\n\nEU member states on Wednesday delayed a decision on whether to grant Britain a three-month Brexit extension, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said if the deadline is deferred to the end of January he would call an election by Christmas.\n\nMarket participants await European and U.S. manufacturing numbers due later on Thursday, to gauge the health of the global economy, and a European Central Bank meeting, with no change to policy expected at President Mario Draghi\u2019s last meeting.\n\nInvestors also await the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on Oct. 29 and 30, where it is expected to reduce its benchmark interest rate for a third consecutive time this year.\n\nFederal fund futures imply that traders see a 91.4% chance for a 25 basis point rate cut. [FEDWATCH]\n\nMeanwhile, Asian shares pulled ahead on Thursday with corporate earnings buffeting trading as investors remained anxious about the business impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war while Brexit uncertainties kept overall sentiment in check.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war has hit financial markets and forced most major central banks to cut interest rates this year.\n\nThe non-yielding bullion is often seen as a safer investment during times of political and financial uncertainty.\n\nSPDR Gold Trust (GLD), the world\u2019s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.13% to 918.48 tonnes on Wednesday from 919.66 tonnes on Tuesday.\n\nElsewhere, silver XAG= was flat at $17.57 an ounce. Platinum XPT= was up 0.3% at $917.70 per, after scaling a more than three-week high earlier, while palladium XPD= edged up 0.6% to $1,752.09 per ounce.", "description": "Gold prices barely moved on Thursday as investors waited for clarity on Brexit after the European Union delayed a decision on granting an extension to Britain, and the U.S. central bank policy meeting for clues on its interest rate trajectory.", "authors": ["Diptendu Lahiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444323615&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N02D", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
