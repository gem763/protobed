How about podcasts?'\"\n\nA few months later Ben received a call from the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nThey said they couldn't find any earlier citation of the word \"podcast\" and asked if he had really made it up?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The 2012 launch of the iPhone podcast app helped change the world of podcasting\n\nYes, he had. Podcasts may not have been born that evening - but they had been christened.\n\nA decade and a half later, what had been a motley collection of what Mr Hammersley calls \"mostly unlistenable\" MP3 recordings has become a global industry.\n\nTechnical breakthrough\n\nPodcasts are now produced by commercial broadcasters, individuals and companies with no connection to broadcasting. In fact anyone with something to say, and a few pounds to spend on the equipment to say it, can get involved.\n\nThe digital audio files are cheap to produce and, thanks to the internet, easy to distribute.\n\nMr Hammersley says two changes transformed the market - one cultural and one technical.\n\nA technical breakthrough came in 2012 when Apple produced the iPhone podcast app, which proved a popular library system for listeners.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nThis was followed by a dramatic improvement in inexpensive recording production and editing equipment.\n\nFinally, the development of 4G mobile phone connections and widespread wi-fi meant listeners could browse, download or stream shows whenever they wanted.\n\nThe cultural breakthrough came in 2014 with a very specific podcast - Serial, a piece of investigative journalism hosted by Sarah Koenig, narrating a non-fiction story over multiple episodes.\n\nTo date, the first and second seasons of the show have had more than 340 million downloads\n\n\"Serial changed everything. By the time it got into series two, the advertising space sold out in a day for sums that went into the millions,\" Mr Hammersley says.\n\nImage copyright Sandy Honig Image caption Reporter Sarah Koenig and the Serial team popularised the \"true crime\" podcast\n\nGeorgie Howes, a consultant at market research firm Ovum, says British series My Dad Wrote a Porno also helped raise awareness. Launched in 2015, it quickly became a hit, going on to have more than 180 million downloads.\n\n\"That was the point at which the advertisers started to catch on to [podcasts'] value,\" she says.\n\nToday we are in the middle of a podcast boom. In the UK nearly six million adults tune in each week, about double that of five years ago, according to the telecoms regulator Ofcom.\n\nPodcasts are now available on a wide range of platforms, with streaming sites like Spotify competing with downloads.\n\nAnd where the audience goes, the money follows.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018 advertising spending on podcasts in the UK went from $10.6m (\u00a38.5m) to $19.7m, an 85% increase, according to Ovum. It expects the annual expansion in ad revenue to be in double digits over the next five years.\n\nIt's not the size of the audiences that is important to advertisers, it's who they are. Podcasts offer a chance to speak intimately to a very precise selection of people.\n\nImage copyright Bill McCay Image caption Singer George Ezra is getting in on the podcasting act\n\nA half-hour podcast on, say, 1950s sci-fi novels, is going to hit a very specific audience. If you want to target gaming fans you go for a gaming podcast. That specificity can be worth a lot of money.\n\nThe Stockholm-based podcasting platform Acast says that average industry rates for podcast advertising range from $18 for a 30-second ad to $25 for 60 seconds, for every thousand listeners. That's 50-100% more than broadcast radio advertising.\n\nThe art of the podcast ad\n\nBut podcasting advertising comes in many forms.\n\nThe first is similar to what you would hear on traditional radio - in other words, professionally produced adverts for products or services.\n\nBut there's a slight difference. Such ads have to be \"less shouty and more subtle\" to work in the more intimate environment of a podcast, says Joe Copeman, the managing director of Acast.\n\nThen there is sponsorship. In the early days this was simply a case of the podcast host dropping a glowing reference to the sponsor's name into the script.\n\nBut increasingly hosts are recording adverts themselves, which are then edited into the show.\n\nOn top of this companies are making their own podcasts, to help draw people to their brands.\n\nSuch marketing can be powerful when it's done well, says Mr Copeman: \"It is great to be in that space where people are immersed in the sound of a person's voice, where they are enclosed in that world.\"\n\nBroadcasting change\n\nThe boom in podcasting embraces a huge range of talent, from professional broadcasters to enthusiasts offering insights on anything from off-the-wall conspiracy theories to whale watching.\n\nIn fact, as Ben Hammersley explains, podcasting has brought people into broadcasting who would normally never have seen the inside of a recording studio.\n\n\"There are of course professional podcasters, but there are many more people who create quality content and do it for nothing,\" he says.\n\nAnd that is changing not just the way we listen to audio but the way the broadcasting industry works.\n\n\"If you are a 20-year-old just out of college, wanting to be a radio producer and full of ideas, what do you do?\" Mr Hammersley continues. \"Go and apply for a job in local radio and end up making the tea for three years? Or go straight into making programmes for podcasting?\n\n\"That's something the main broadcasters haven't yet really accepted, but that is the way it's going.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Jo Wood at the launch of her podcast Alien Nation\n\nCelebrity opportunities\n\nOf course if you are a celebrity, podcasts can provide a new branch of business.\n\nJo Wood, ex-wife of Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, and long convinced of the existence of alien life, this year launched Alien Nation. It hosts \"other celebrities, experts, and everyday earthlings who have had close encounters or simply think we cannot be the only planet with life in this vast universe\".\n\nThe singer George Ezra has done a series of \"George Ezra and Friends\" podcasts, in which he interviews other famous musicians such as Lily Allen, Ed Sheeran and Jessie Ware (who has her own podcast called Table Manners).\n\n\"For these artists it's less about sales as about exploring new areas,\" says Mr Copeman.\n\n\"Jessie [Ware] has really been able to monetise her podcasts and attracted sponsors, but she has also opened a way into another profession, testing out her presenting skills.\"", "description": "Podcasting has come of age, with today's increasingly slick productions attracting big advertising money.", "authors": ["Jamie Robertson", "Technology Of Business Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1174C/production/_108800517_benhammersley-1010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
