The trial, full of tales of sex and violence, made headlines nationwide.\n\nThe Maricopa County Attorney's Office did not initially provide comment when contacted by The Arizona Republic.\n\nSeparate from the Arias criminal case, Martinez faces a series of ethics complaints by the State Bar of Arizona and Arias' lawyers for behavior in multiple criminal cases.\n\nAmong the ethics allegations that stem from the Arias trial: He provided information to a blogger covering the Arias trial, provided false testimony during an investigation and made sexual remarks to a Maricopa County Superior Court employee.\n\nThe Arizona Supreme Court's disciplinary panel will determine whether Martinez violated professional conduct rules. If the panel finds Martinez in violation, it will decide sanctions.\n\nBackground: Arias defense attorney says she received death threats\n\nJodi Arias case: Victim's family says, 'There is no justice.'\n\nKaren Clark, Arias' attorney in the ethics case, said the disciplinary case and the criminal case seem to be converging on the same issue \u2013 whether Martinez violated the rules and if he should be held accountable for it.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the court of appeals has focused on the issue of prosecutorial misconduct by Juan Martinez,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate \u2026 I\u2019m encouraged that the court is focusing on his misconduct because the record supports it.\u201d\n\nMartinez was transferred out of the capital litigation bureau to the auto theft division of the Maricopa County Attorney's Office to have more time to focus on the ethics complaints.\n\nThe Court of Appeals order in the Arias case stated that it will look at a series of issues concerning prosecutorial misconduct, including:\n\nIs Arias is entitled to a new trial if there was intentional prosecutorial misconduct, and would double jeopardy play a role?\n\nWhat factors are relevant in determining whether Arias was denied a fair trial based on prosecutorial misconduct? Does publicity around the trial affect the decision?\n\nWas she deprived of the ability to present her defense to the jury?\n\nIf there was prosecutorial misconduct, did it contribute to her guilty verdict?\n\nShould the publicity outside the courtroom be considered when deciding if the atmosphere of the trial was \"circus-like\"? Can publicity outside the courtroom grant a reversal?\n\nThe court has not scheduled a date for the oral arguments.\n\nFollow Lauren Castle on Twitter: @Lauren_Castle.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Jodi Arias' case: Appeals court to hear prosecutor misconduct claims", "description": "The Arizona Court of Appeals will consider how allegations of misconduct against prosecutor Juan Martinez could overturn Jodi Arias' conviction.", "authors": ["Lauren Castle", "Arizona Republic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
