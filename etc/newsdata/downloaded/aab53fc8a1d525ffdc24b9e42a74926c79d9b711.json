Someone with straight, fine, or high-porosity hair (meaning there are gaps in the cuticle that absorb and lose moisture quickly) using a volumizing shampoo and conditioner might be disappointed by a formula that adds extra weight, says stylist Koni Bennett. Meanwhile, another person with curly, coarse, or low-porosity hair (a tight cuticle layer resistant to moisture) who\u2019s already using a moisture-rich shampoo, may like the extra layer of protection from heat or locked-in moisture to safeguard against styling products that follow. But hands down, the one group that could surely benefit from a leave-in are those who dye their hair. \u201cNo matter how great the color turned out, it won\u2019t thrive unless the hair is healthy,\u201d says Austin Medearis, a master colorist at Butterfly Studio Salon.\n\nSince a leave-in conditioner can make or break your style, we asked Medearis, Bennett, and six other hairstylists about their favorite formulas for hydrating every hair type, from curly to damaged to color-treated.\n\nBest overall leave-in conditioner\n\nOuai Leave-in Conditioner Karen Miller, a stylist at Spoke and Weal, recommends the Ouai Leave-In Conditioner \u201cfor any hair type,\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cwater-based and gives more of a protein conditioning,\u201d which means it won\u2019t weigh hair down but still gives hydration. Among its ingredients, tamarind-seed extract and vitamin E help pack in added moisture. For straight to wavy hair, Miller says you can spray it on with the option of letting it air-dry or styling it because it \u201cacts as a heat protectant as well.\u201d For more coily textures, she loves how it leaves the hair \u201cfeeling more silky rather than too oily\u201d after you straighten it. It\u2019s also a favorite of Rio, who uses it to keep her hair silky smooth while traveling. Last month, she wrote about how it gave her overly bleached hair a nice shine, and in her roundup of products for double-processed hair says it gives her that \u201cfinal kick of moisture and nourishment it needs to ensure it feels perfectly silky and smooth once dry.\u201d Giovanni Vaccaro, artistic director of Glamsquad, says he likes to use it on clients who love beachy waves: \u201cI\u2019ll spray it in to detangle before using a wave spray.\u201d He adds that on top of it being color-safe, he loves its bergamot, lemon, and magnolia-laced scent. $26 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest leave-in conditioner for all hair types\n\nBriogeo Rosarco Milk Reparative Leave-In Conditioning Spray According to Vaccaro, a hard-working leave-in conditioner should do a few things \u2014 hydrate, heat-protect, and detangle \u2014 which is why he loves BrioGeo\u2019s Rosarco Reparative Leave-In Spray so much. \u201cThis stuff is vegan and cruelty free and leaves your hair feeling amazing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for all hair types \u2014 its coconut, rosehip, and argan oils won\u2019t weigh hair down, but it\u2019s nourishing enough to de-frizz any head of hair.\u201d Vaccaro says it\u2019s even safe for color-treated hair, and people with textured or curly hair will benefit from the \u201cdetangling agents.\u201d $20 at Sephora Buy\n\nReverie Milk Anti-Frizz Leave-In Nourishing Treatment Garrett Bryant, owner of Hawthorne salon, says that he\u2019s obsessed with this leave-in milk \u201cbecause it absorbs into the hair and treats the strands, as opposed to sitting on top of the cuticle, giving the illusion of shine and hydration.\u201d Some of its hydrating ingredients include coconut, olive, and almond-oil extracts. Bryant thinks this milk \u201cis a perfect balance of moisture,\u201d using it on a variety of clients from those with long, fine hair pre-blowout to those with textured, curly hair who want to wear their hair natural. This leave-in works with a number of styles, as Bryant notes, it \u201clayers well with other products, like mouses, gels, and balms for added moisture.\u201d In a conversation with Rio, Emaly Baum, a colorist at Suite Caroline, said despite its \u201creally nice creamy consistency\u201d she uses \u201ca ton\u201d in her really fine hair and adds, \u201cit\u2019s really great for wavy-haired girls too, on day two of no hair washing.\u201d $42 at Credo Beauty Buy\n\nIles Formula Finishing Serum This serum leaves a lot of room for versatility, as Medearis says it works for most hair types, and is lightweight enough for air-drying or heat-styling. Not to mention, it serves a number of purposes: \u201cMy clients are always impressed with this leave-in. It\u2019s their heat protectant, it\u2019s their styling gel, it\u2019s a one stop shop \u2014 all without weighing the hair down.\u201d $46 at Amazon Buy $46 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest leave-in conditioner for curly hair\n\nOribe Priming Lotion Leave-In Conditioning Detangler Medearis is a colorist but also a self-proclaimed \u201ccurl enthusiast\u201d who turns to Oribe\u2019s moisture-and-control line when he\u2019s working with curly hair that\u2019s also color-treated. He recommends silicone-free products (because silicone doesn\u2019t penetrate the hair or add nutrients \u2014 it just creates buildup) for curly hair along with something to restore the natural pH (look for aloe vera in the ingredient list). \u201cThe Oribe Priming Lotion does all of the above,\u201d says Medaris. \u201cHighly textured curly hair is naturally lacking moisture \u2014 and color-treated curls are even more at risk of damage. I\u2019m always recommending products with natural based ingredients that will penetrate the curls and preserve their natural texture and bounce.\u201d $38 at Dermstore Buy\n\nSheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Leave-In Conditioner If your strands are fine and thin, this might not be for you, but it\u2019s Vacarro\u2019s go-to for \u201creally curly, textured hair.\u201d He says it\u2019s \u201crich and carries weight,\u201d but \u201cthis leave-in will have your hair feeling shiny and silky due to its shea butter, castor oil, and reparative omegas.\u201d $14 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nTRESemme Expert Selection Pre-Styling Spray Repair & Protect 7 Adding a leave-in conditioner into your wash day routine is already an added expense, but Bennett thinks this \u201clow-cost hidden gem\u201d is the perfect solution. She thinks it works particularly well on kids with kinky-curly hair as it \u201cadds the perfect \u2018slip\u2019 to textured hair, making detangling a breeze.\u201d $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nDevaCurl Leave-In Decadence Ultra Moisturizing Leave-In Conditioner While one of our writers swears by the entire line of DevaCurl products for her curly hair (\u201cThe products are my miracle drugs and I don\u2019t care how much they cost\u201d), Miller is specifically in love with the leave-in for her curly to coily clients. The formula is free from drying sulfates and rich with pequi oil and chufa milk. \u201cIt leaves your curls so moisturized and nourished.\u201d $26 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest lightweight leave-in conditioner\n\nLernberger Stafsing BB Cream Leave-in treatment Leave-in conditioners should be \u201ceasy to use, multitasking, and not leave your hair feeling greasy,\u201d says Takamichi Saeki, creative director at Takamichi Hair. He likes this all-in-one beauty balm because it treats, moisturizes, protects, corrects, and fights frizz. \u201cIt does all this without leaving you with that greasy feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to over apply when hair is wet, and then you might need to wash again.\u201d For \u201cvery dehydrated, brittle hair,\u201d Saeki mixes it with a few drops of hair oil. $31 at Takamichi Beauty Room Buy\n\nK\u00e9rastase Creme Magistrale Celebrity hairstylist Jennifer Yepez has styled the hair of the Hadid sisters, Laura Harrier, and Jessica Alba, but this is the leave-in conditioner she uses on her own hair. She uses it daily and swears \u201cit smooths and hydrates [her] dry ends, but never leaves them feeling greasy.\u201d Fans of the power pony, take note: \u201cIt\u2019s also perfect second-day styler, if you want to put your hair in an up-do and just need to smooth out the ends.\u201d $37 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest leave-in conditioner for damaged hair\n\nOlaplex, No.6 Bond Smoother Olaplex\u2019s at-home hair repair system has a genuine, unpaid endorsement from Kim Kardashian, who, according to our friends at the Cut, said, \u201cWhen your hair is really damaged, if you sleep in that, it really works,\u201d during her master makeup class back in 2015. This leave-in is an add-on to the cult favorite system that Lundy, a stylist at Fringe Salon, loves. Olaplex, the line\u2019s main ingredient not the brand, is designed to repair and protect, which is why Lundy recommends this to clients with damaged and over-processed hair. Not only is it a leave-in conditioner, but it also doubles as a styling cream that \u201cprotects hair, hydrates and gives you a smooth blow out.\u201d Bonus: \u201cIt\u2019s also super concentrated, so a little goes a long way,\u201d she adds. $28 at Amazon Buy $28 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest leave-in conditioner for color-treated hair\n\nPureology Colour Fanatic Leave-In Hair Treatment Spray Lundy uses Pureology\u2019s line of products generally for the high-quality vegan ingredients, but specifically likes this leave-in for color-treated hair because it not only helps to keep the color intact but also doubles as a heat protector. \u201cColor-treated hair, especially chemically lightened hair is more fragile and can benefit from extra moisture and definitely needs a good heat protector,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen hair is more fragile from being colored, it\u2019s important to prevent breakage and further damage. Even brushing out very tangled hair, or using hot tools and blow dryers without heat protection can add to breakage.\u201d This leave-in Lundy explains has \u201cmultiple benefits\u201d including being great for detangling, conditioning, and acting as a heat and UV protector. \u201cI\u2019ll spray this in before a blowout, and even hair that\u2019s been through multiple color services still looks shiny and smooth.\u201d $26 at Amazon Buy $26 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest leave-in conditioner for extending your shampoos\n\nLiving Proof Perfect Hair Day 5-in-1 Styling Treatment \u201cThis is the best for people who don\u2019t like a ton of product in their hair, but still want a little moisture and hold to their style,\u201d says Bryant. He particularly recommends it for people who don\u2019t wash their hair everyday. \u201cWhen you apply it to wet hair and allow it to air-dry completely, it sets like a gel in the hair. But once you break it up with your hands, there\u2019s no residue-y product feel in your hair at all.\u201d It also rinses out nicely, he adds, which is great for people who don\u2019t want to wash their hair every day but still want to wet their hair in the shower. $28 at Sephora Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
