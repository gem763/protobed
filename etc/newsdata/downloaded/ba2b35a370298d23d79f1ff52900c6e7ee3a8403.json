Jeremy D. Larson\u2019s piece is rich with details about the Eau Claire County crooner, but the best one is in the first sentence:\n\n\u201cJustin Vernon lights a blunt as he charges his Tesla, which is affectionately named John Teshla.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious imagining that the man, famous for writing sad tunes alone in the woods, drives the automobile preferred by Jake Paul. But it\u2019s even better that he\u2019s named it after a pun on everyone\u2019s favorite former Entertainment Tonight host and composer of the best sports theme song.\n\nWhile we\u2019re talking about Bon Iver, I\u2019ve actually been thinking a lot about the music I liked in high school and college, thanks to the many mutations of the Spongebob lunch table memes that have polluted my timeline:\n\nATTN 2000s high school grads of the alt persuasion: where are you sitting??? pic.twitter.com/qKjNlCNf9c \u2014 Suzy Exposito (@HexPositive) August 13, 2019\n\n(I\u2019m a one, four, and five, in that order \u2014 though I have some misgivings about these groupings. Anyway.)\n\nI got to wondering: what would the indie bands I loved a decade ago name their Teslas? So like Justin Vernon, I lit a blunt, charged my electric car, and wrote down some ideas.\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs: Model Y Control\n\nThe Shins: Car-ing Is Creepy\n\nMGMT: Electric Feel (don\u2019t even have to do anything to this one)\n\nLCD Soundsystem: Azealia Banks Is Playing at My House\n\nArcade Fire: My Battery Is a Cage\n\nThe Killers: SpaceXman\n\nInterpol: Obstacle Model 3\n\n3 Hoobastank: Hyperloopastank (h/t Sean, who somehow knew that I love singing \u201cThe Reason\u201d at karaoke)\n\nBroken Social Scene: Anthems for a 48-Year-Old Baby\n\nDeath Cab for Cutie: I Will Follow You Into the Dank Memes\n\nRadiohead: Karma Police (the SEC)\n\nStrokes: Someday (in reference to Tesla\u2019s profitability)\n\nStrokes: Hard to Explain (in reference to Elon\u2019s behavior)\n\nStrokes: You Talk Way Too Much (in reference to Elon\u2019s tweets)\n\nStrokes: Room on Fire (you get the point \u2014 the Strokes make this very easy)\n\nAll that to say, go read the Bon Iver profile at Pitchfork. It\u2019s a lot more thoughtful than these bad puns. And please drop off your worst indie puns in the comments.", "description": "\"Justin Vernon lights a blunt as he charges his Tesla, which is affectionately named John Teshla,\" writes Pitchfork in their new profile of the artist widely known as Bon Iver.
