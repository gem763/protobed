Was there ANY consultation with athletes over this?\" Dunfee wrote.\n\nAn Olympic panel has been consulting with sports governing bodies while assessing heat and weather issues for the July 24-Aug 9 Tokyo Games.\n\n\"The IOC working group identified the marathon and race walk as the events that would put particular heat stress on the athletes,\" it said.\n\nThe marathons were already due to start at 6 a.m. in Tokyo to ease the heat effect on runners. The men's 50-kilometer race walk final was slated for a 5:30 a.m. start.\n\nThe IOC said it informed the governing body of track will also consult Olympic teams and broadcasters.\n\n\"Giving athletes the best platform for their performances within the environment they are in is central to all major events,\" IAAF president Sebastian Coe said in the IOC statement.\n\nIn Doha, 28 of 68 starters failed to finish the women's marathon and 18 of 73 men failed to complete the course.\n\nEthiopian distance-running great Haile Gebrselassie said athletes \"could have died\" in the women's race.\n\nAn Olympic panel overseeing preparations will discuss heat measures at its Oct 30-Nov 1 meeting in Tokyo.\n\n\"These include better shade, water sprays, better access to water supplies and an initiative to help the athletes in their preparations,\" the IOC said.\n\nThe plan driven by increasing summer heat cuts into a key promise of Tokyo's bidding, first for the 2016 Olympics won by Rio de Janeiro and then its successful 2020 campaign, to deliver a \"compact games\" with 85% of venues in an 8-kilometer city center cluster.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
