The sleaze inquiry was put on hold during a police investigation which concluded without charges, and was later delayed again due to Mr Vaz\u2019s ill-health.\n\nIn a report detailing the findings of her inquiry, commissioner Kathryn Stone said that tape recordings of his conversations with the two men contained evidence of Mr Vaz\u2019s \u201capparent willingness to purchase controlled drugs for others to use\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We recommend that the House should suspend Mr Vaz from its service for six months.\u201d\n\nThe committee said that on leaving parliament, Mr Vaz \u2013 an MP of more than 32 years\u2019 standing \u2013 should be stripped of the right to a former member\u2019s pass allowing him to use facilities at Westminster.\n\nThe commissioner did not uphold allegations that Mr Vaz should have stepped aside from inquiries into psychoactive drugs and prostitution conducted by the committee he chaired.\n\nWhile it was \u201cmore likely than not that Mr Vaz has engaged in paid sexual activity\u201d, it was not clear whether he had done so during the period of the prostitution inquiry, she found. And she said the evidence she saw did not demonstrate that the MP had any involvement in the use of drugs relevant to the committee\u2019s narcotics inquiry.\n\nMr Vaz told the commissioner his encounter with the men was to discuss plans to decorate his flat, and that the recording of their conversation was not reliable. He said that because they were involved in a sting operation, the men steered the conversation in a way which gave a misleading impression. Eight months after the event, he contacted the commissioner to say he could not discuss what happened in detail because he had little memory of the evening, possibly due to his drink being spiked.\n\nBut after taking evidence from two experts, Ms Stone found no evidence that the tape was doctored or tampered with.\n\nAnd she found it \u201cincredible\u201d that the MP could have invited two men who he did not know to his flat at 11.30pm on a Saturday to discuss a decoration project, particularly as there was no mention of the subject during the recording of their 90-minute visit.\n\nThe committee dismissed Mr Vaz\u2019s claims about the purpose of the men\u2019s visit as \u201cfrankly ludicrous\u201d, adding: \u201cWe find the evidence to be compelling that Mr Vaz was previously acquainted with the men, that he had paid them money to engage in sexual activity with him, that he had paid money to procure the attendance of a third man also to engage in sexual activity.\u201d\n\nIt said the evidence was \u201ccompelling\u201d that Mr Vaz\u2019s explanation of events was \u201cnot believable\u201d and that he had expressed willingness to buy a class A drug for the use of another person.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe contents of the covert audio-recording contain nothing to suggest that Mr Vaz was being tricked or inveigled into doing anything he was reluctant to do \u2026 they strongly suggest that he had engaged in similar activities on previous occasions.\u201d\n\nThe committee accepted the commissioner\u2019s finding that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that his drink was spiked, adding that his claimed amnesia \u201cdoes not prevent us from reaching our own conclusions as to the nature of those events and the plausibility of Mr Vaz\u2019s overall evidence\u201d.\n\nAnd it rejected the MP\u2019s argument that he cannot have breached parliament\u2019s code of conduct because the events complained of were \u201cpurely private and personal\u201d.\n\nIn a damning conclusion on the MP\u2019s conduct during the inquiry, the committee said: \u201cMuch of the welter of documentation and procedural challenges which has emanated from Mr Vaz has been designed, in our opinion, to \u2018throw dust in the eyes\u2019 of the commissioner and the committee.\n\n\u201cThe core issues in this inquiry are relatively simple; but Mr Vaz has done his best to complicate, obfuscate and confuse the inquiry through arguments of little merit and documentation of dubious relevance.\u201d\n\nHowever, the committee stressed: \u201cIn reaching this conclusion, we are not seeking to judge Mr Vaz\u2019s private life or his personal morality. We note in this context that payment for sexual services, between consenting adults, is not a criminal offence.\u201d", "description": "The House of Commons\u2019 standards\u00a0watchdog has recommended a six-month suspension for Labour MP Keith Vaz after finding that he significantly damaged the reputation of parliament by offering to buy cocaine during an encounter with two male prostitutes. If approved by the Commons, the sanction will trigger the terms of recall legislation, allowing constituents to sign a petition", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/03/20/15/vaz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
