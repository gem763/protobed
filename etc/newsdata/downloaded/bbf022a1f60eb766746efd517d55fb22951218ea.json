REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nBut behind the glossy brochures, it was struggling to adapt to market changes: while taking over rivals delivered short-term savings, it propelled the British brand toward a $2.1 billion debt pile that would ultimately seal its fate.\n\nIt narrowly avoided collapse in 2011 when, reeling from the Arab Spring, Icelandic volcano and a squeeze on British incomes, it had to beg for a 200 million pound ($249 million) lifeline.\n\nEight years later it was in the same position, but its creditors had enough. With the business draining cash, Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser found its lenders, bondholders and even the government were no longer willing to step in.\n\nIts collapse in the early hours of Monday left hundreds of thousands of people stranded at holiday destinations around the world and the British government leading the biggest peacetime repatriation in British history.\n\nOne person familiar with the situation said lenders and bondholders had backed Thomas Cook through the busy summer months, when up to 2 million people were on holiday in peak weeks, and then pulled the plug at the first opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a deal (the lenders) wanted to do,\u201d the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIt is exposed to events that can\u2019t be predicted, they didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nThe British government decided Thomas Cook was a bet it did not want to take after the banks had lost patience.\n\nMedia reports in recent weeks had prompted suppliers to call in debts and future customers to go elsewhere, draining the business of the cash it needed to continue. \u201cIt got to a full scale run on the business,\u201d the person said.\n\nMORTGAGING THE FUTURE\n\nThe pressure on the balance sheet stemmed from the 2007 merger of Thomas Cook, which was German owned at the time, with Airtours-brand owner MyTravel, creating a 2.8 billion-pound group.\n\nBoth companies had survived an industry downturn a few years earlier by slashing jobs, and boss Manny Fontenla-Novoa delivered more cuts, helping him to take home 7 million pounds in 2008 as his reward.\n\nTwo years later, Thomas Cook drove more consolidation by buying the Co-operative Group\u2019s high street travel and foreign exchange business, giving it a total of 1,200 shops.\n\nBy betting on size, the company had burdened itself with expensive shops just as more customers were moving online.\n\nIn 2010, the industry was rocked by disruption from the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud and the Arab Spring, leading to a string of profit warnings.\n\nFontenla-Novoa quit in 2011, after he had earned 17.2 million pounds during his tenure.\n\nMonths later the company agreed a 200 million pound loan from lenders, with an eye-watering 6% interest, rising 0.5 percentage points every quarter.\n\nDEBT MOUNTAIN\n\nHarriet Green was hired in 2012 to lead a turnaround, after telling the chairman \u201cI think you need me\u201d.\n\nAfter cutting the cost base she left suddenly two years later, having increased the value of the group from 148 million pounds to just under 2 billion pounds. She earned nearly 4.9 million pounds.\n\nCompany insider Fankhauser took over. He apologized for the tragic deaths of two children while staying at a hotel booked through Thomas Cook in 2006, and initiated an independent review of its customer service.\n\nHe also reduced the company\u2019s portfolio of hotels and jettisoned Club 18-30, a \u201csun, sea and sex\u201d brand that reached a zenith in the 1990s but felt increasingly dated.\n\nHowever, he was forever boxed-in by the company\u2019s $2.1 billion debt, which required the group to sell 3 million holidays to service.\n\nHe agreed the main terms of a rescue deal from its largest shareholder, China\u2019s Fosun Tourism, last month, but was unable to secure 200 million to keep operating through the winter.\n\nIn May of this year the company wrote off the value of the MyTravel deal, some 12 years after the tie-up.\n\nAlarmed by the rate at which the business was burning through cash and with the tough winter period ahead, its stakeholders pulled their support. In desperate meetings held over the weekend, it even asked credit card companies to release 50 million pounds held as collateral against its bookings.\n\nFankhauser has earned 8.3 million pounds, including 4.3 million pounds in 2015.\n\n\u201cThere was no way to prevent this collapse,\u201d a second source familiar with the situation said. \u201cWhat else was left to do?\u201d\n\nPassengers wait for their flights inside the Ioannis Kapodistrias International Airport after Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm collapsed stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history, on the island of Corfu, Greece, September 23, 2019 REUTERS/Antonis Skordilis\n\nThe last passengers on a Thomas Cook flight landed in Manchester, England, on Monday morning, as customers and staff tried to come to terms with the loss of a company that, founded in 1841, had brought much joy to millions.\n\nHolidaymaker Ricky Houston said on Monday he\u2019d had a fantastic week in Corfu, Greece, with Thomas Cook.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for the reps\u201d, he said. \u201cFor us it\u2019s an inconvenience, for them, it\u2019s their livelihoods.\u201d", "description": "Thomas Cook sold tens of millions of Britons a summer holiday to remember with the slogan \"Don't just book it, Thomas Cook it\".", "authors": ["Paul Sandle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433018388&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1HY", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
