Last season, Matt Nagy was NFL Coach of the Year and Mitchell Trubisky was in the Pro Bowl. While Trubisky is the one getting booed by Bears fans for every throw he misses and every sack he takes \u2014 and on Sunday, there were many chances to boo \u2014 nobody in the Bears offense looks good. Including the coach.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nChicago fell to 3-3 with a rough 36-25 loss to the Saints. With less than 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter, the Bears had 94 yards and four first downs. A couple meaningless touchdowns at the end won\u2019t fix anything. The Saints lost Drew Brees and they\u2019re 5-0 without him. Against the Bears they didn\u2019t have phenomenal running back Alvin Kamara, who was out with a high ankle sprain, or tight end Jared Cook either.\n\nAnd yet, it was the Bears\u2019 offense that looked anemic.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with the Bears offense?\n\nNagy was celebrated for his magic on the sideline last season, leading the Bears to an NFC North title. That immediate success took expectations to a higher level, and the Bears aren\u2019t living up to them. Though, no matter the preseason expectations, this offense wouldn\u2019t fly in Chicago.\n\nStory continues\n\nLet\u2019s start with the running game. Over the offseason the Bears traded away Jordan Howard. The Bears got a conditional 2020 sixth-round pick that could improve to a fifth-rounder. Howard couldn\u2019t catch the ball, and therefore wasn\u2019t a fit in Nagy\u2019s offense. The Bears drafted David Montgomery in the third round. Montgomery has done very little, and he had a costly fumble on Sunday. The Bears can\u2019t run the ball and rarely tried Sunday. Chicago had 17 rushing yards on only seven attempts. According to Kevin Fishbain of The Athletic, that\u2019s the fewest rushing attempts in Bears history, and that covers a lot of games. Meanwhile, Howard is having a good season for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe absolute lack of a running game isn\u2019t ideal for anyone but can be overcome if the quarterback is transcendent. That\u2019s not the case in Chicago, as the fans will let you know.\n\nTrubisky came back from a left non-throwing shoulder injury on Sunday. He was bad. Trubisky missed plenty of passes that an quarterback needs to make. On one, Anthony Miller got deep and was wide open, and Trubisky overthrew him by a few yards.\n\nLast season, Trubisky looked like he was developing. He was still far from a finished product, but there were signs of progress. He has taken a step back from that progress and then some. It was surprising the Bears didn\u2019t bench Trubisky for Chase Daniel at any point Sunday.\n\nMitchell Trubisky was booed often by Bears fans on Sunday. (Getty Images)\n\nMitchell Trubisky has regressed\n\nTrubisky was the second pick of the draft, and it\u2019s looking like a mistake. Trubisky is still early in his career but this season has been a clear step back. It looks worse every time someone brings up that the Bears passed on Deshaun Watson and Patrick Mahomes to draft Trubisky.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what the correct ratio of blame is for the Bears. Nagy hasn\u2019t looked like the genius that was the talk of the NFL last season. He doesn\u2019t want to commit to the running game and hasn\u2019t generated a lot of easy passes for his quarterback. But, it\u2019s hard to call run plays when none of them work, and whenever the Bears have a pass play that looks like a winner, Trubisky has either missed the read or hasn\u2019t hit the pass.\n\nSean Payton has been one of the NFL\u2019s best coaches for a while, and he\u2019s having a tremendous season. Without Brees, the Saints haven\u2019t had a great offense but it has been good enough. New Orleans\u2019 defense has been very good. For a moment it looked like New Orleans might be in some trouble with Brees out due to thumb surgery, but now they look like a Super Bowl favorite considering Brees will come back soon. It\u2019s an impressive job by Payton and his staff.\n\nThere was a big difference in coaching Sunday. The Saints had a big edge at quarterback too, even though they\u2019re using backup Teddy Bridgewater. There\u2019s not much to like about the Bears now, particularly on offense, and the fans weren\u2019t holding back their feelings about it on Sunday.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
