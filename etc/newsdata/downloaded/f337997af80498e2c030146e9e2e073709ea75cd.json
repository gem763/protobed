By one estimate, there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2021.\n\nThanks to this high demand for cybersecurity professionals, combined with the low supply of qualified candidates, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to recruit individuals into the ranks of the government.\n\nThe problem is aggravated when the private sector offers a plethora of jobs for individuals with this skill set. Those jobs tend to offer superior pay, a more casual work environment, and better opportunities for employees to hone their craft.\n\nThe Pentagon makes its search even more difficult because of its unwillingness to accept applicants who lack college degrees, regardless of their technical qualifications.\n\nThe military will provide cybersecurity training and jobs for personnel who receive a qualifying score on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test. But entry-level civilian cybersecurity jobs at the Department of Defense usually require a bachelor\u2019s degree, despite the fact that many of the technical qualifications for these professionals can be achieved without ever stepping onto a college campus.\n\nThe current hiring model is simply not working.\n\nThe Department of Defense\u2019s unnecessary focus on traditional educational backgrounds only shrinks the already dwindling pool of potential workers even further.\n\nThe Department of Defense must recruit candidates who have nontraditional\u2014yet professional\u2014educational backgrounds to allow for more potential candidates, as The Heritage Foundation laid out in its recommendations for the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nA start would be to accept credentials from Massive Online Open Courses\u2014aka \u201cMOOCs\u201d\u2014and technology boot camps. These two excellent forms of nontraditional education are widely respected in the cybersecurity field, with many graduates from MOOCs and boot camps landing jobs in the private sector.\n\nOne particular technology boot camp, known as Coding Dojo, boasted that 94 percent of its onsite graduates got technology-related jobs within 180 days of graduation.\n\nMOOCs and technology boot camps each present their own unique strengths in the realm of cybersecurity studies.\n\nMOOCs are very fluid and adaptable courses. They allow a student to learn the necessary skills required for a cybersecurity job by adding courses that complement their own personal strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThey can be used both as a supplement to conventional study or as a stand-alone course to achieve certifications.\n\nTechnology boot camps are much more focused in nature, with courses that tend to be shorter, yet more intense.\n\nMuch like their military namesakes, these courses teach all of their students the same curriculum, starting from an assumption that they have no prior computer experience. While less fluid, they put a lot of focus on practical skill sets and future job placement.\n\nWhen it comes to the military, the department already has technical requirements that an applicant must possess before being qualified for a job, so it should not matter whether a candidate met these requirements through their education in a college, a MOOC, or a technology boot camp.\n\nOpening up to these nontraditional educational backgrounds would make the recruiting pool much wider.\n\nSuch a policy would help the performance of the cybersecurity force, since more unconventional backgrounds would bring different strengths to the table.\n\nAdm. Mike Rogers, former commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, promoted this sort of diversity, warning against relying on \u201ccookie cutter\u201dpersonnel.\n\nChanging the department\u2019s educational requirements would result in a larger, more diversified, and ultimately more effective U.S. cybersecurity force.\n\nThe Defense Department must now choose whether it will renovate an antiquated system or fall by the wayside in the stiff competition for cybersecurity talent.", "description": "What do GPS satellites, F-35s, and the new Department of Veterans Affairs health care records management system have in common?\u00a0\n\nThe latest Defense Department annual assessment of cyberthreats has found disturbing\u00a0weaknesses\u00a0in each of these systems.", "authors": ["Elias Gavilan", "Commentary By", "Spring Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation", "Research Associate", "Center For National Defense"], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-02/GettyImages-1018330422.jpg?itok=2TwxUVcH"}
