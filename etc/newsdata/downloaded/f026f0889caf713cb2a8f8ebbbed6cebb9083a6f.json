How often do you take pictures in bad lighting or at night? How often do you capture panoramas? Google appears to have realized that the former scenario is much more likely, and as a result, the company is promoting its Night Sight feature to the main list of camera modes \u2014 and moving panoramas an extra tap away.\n\nAccording to 9to5Google, this has already happen in the leaked Android Q beta build that made its way onto the web yesterday. Night Sight takes the place of Panorama as the left-most mode.\n\nSo if the decision holds when Android Q ships, these are the modes you\u2019ll be able to swipe between from the main viewfinder:\n\nNight Sight\n\nPortrait\n\nCamera\n\nVideo\n\nMore (Panorama, Photo Sphere, Photo Booth, Slow Motion, Time Lapse, Playground, Lens, Settings, etc.)\n\nThe change makes all the sense in the world when you consider how much Google has advertised Night Sight and squared it up against the iPhone XS, which lacks a dedicated low-light shooting mode. Night Sight might have been bested by Huawei, but it\u2019s still a standout feature for the Pixel phones.\n\nGoogle\u2019s panorama mode, meanwhile, is quite good but not really a standout thing when compared to other phones.\n\nBut experienced photographers might be disappointed to learn that in that same updated camera app, the ability to adjust white balance has seemingly been removed. The temperature icon, which let you select from several different white balance presets, is nowhere to be found. Google has never given users the same level of manual white balance control as, say, Samsung, but I\u2019d still prefer to have at least some alternative to trusting the camera\u2019s auto white balance. Sometimes, auto just gets it wrong \u2014 no matter how good your computational photography backend is. Hopefully this is just a bug in the unreleased beta software, however.", "description": "Google\u2019s acclaimed Night Sight low-light camera mode will be much quicker to access in Android Q.
