Site busy try later, 3 hours wasted. Come on customers are upset enough without more hassle and delays.\"\n\nAnother frustrated customer, with the user name @todd-alexandra, described the claims portal as \"pointless and frustrating\" before urging the regulator to \"address this asap\".\n\nThe CAA told Mirror Money: \"While we are aware that some people have had to submit their claim again, 11,500 people have already successfully submitted a claim as of 11am today.\"\n\nAre you struggling to get a refund from Thomas Cook? Let us know at Mirror.Money.Saving@mirror.co.uk\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe claims section of the website went live at 6am on Monday for those with future bookings for Atol-protected holidays to apply for a refund.\n\nThis relates to more than 360,000 bookings covering trips due to be taken by 800,000 people.\n\nAtol-protected customers who were already abroad when Thomas Cook collapsed can also claim for the cost of replacing the parts of their holiday which were financially protected, or out-of-pocket expenses for delayed flights.\n\nThe CAA aims to pay refunds within 60 days of receiving a valid form.\n\nThe CAA's final repatriation flight arrived at Manchester Airport from Orlando on Monday morning.\n\nAbout 140,000 Thomas Cook passengers have been brought home from around the world on 150 aircraft during the past two weeks.\n\n(Image: ARMANDO BABANI/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe vast majority of people flew on their original travel date.\n\nCAA chief executive Richard Moriarty said: \"The largest peacetime repatriation ever required an extraordinary effort from all involved.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone who has played their part in delivering this enormous undertaking, including the passengers we flew home for bearing with us as we undertook this complex operation.\"\n\nThere were also warnings this morning about a suspicious Thomas Cook refund website encouraging customers to hand over personal information in return for help with their refund claim.\n\nThe CAA confirmed \"thomascookrefunds.com\" is a fake - and warned people to only use the official verison - https://thomascook.caa.co.uk/refunds/ .\n\nWhich? Travel editor Rory Boland said: \"Fraudsters circle like sharks around financial disasters, so people should be aware that there are likely to be fake refund websites set up to fleece Thomas Cook customers - and some of them may look very convincing.\n\n\u201cRefunds for Thomas Cook customers will either be handled by the Civil Aviation Authority from Monday (7 October) or by banks and card providers, so we would urge anyone waiting to claim their money back to ignore alternative websites and unsolicited calls or texts promising a refund.\"", "description": "Some customers of Thomas Cook looking for ATOL refunds for their holiday have been angered after the site designed to get their money back froze on them as soon as they tried to use it", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Pa", "Armando Babani Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20156190.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_British-tour-operator-Thomas-Cook-stops-operating-Frankfurt-Am-Main-Germany-03-Jun-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
