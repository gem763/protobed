The fact of the matter is [that] I have never seen [such] a time and I\u2019ve spent thousands of hour in the situation, I\u2019ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places in Syria.\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s tough rhetoric and his positioning as an expert on international matters, the former vice president has long been castigated by members of the military and national security officials over his foreign policy credentials. In particular, Biden has faced consternation for supporting the Iran Nuclear Agreement, proposing a controversial agenda for partitioning Iraq, and downplaying the threat posed by China.\n\nSome of the former vice president\u2019s biggest critics have been Defense Secretaries Robert Gates and James Mattis, two men beloved by the international affairs experts.\n\nGates, who led the Pentagon under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, asserted during a May interview with CBS\u2019s Face the Nation he stood by statements made in his 2014 memoir that Biden had \u201cbeen wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201d The show\u2019s host, Margaret Brennan, looped Gates\u2019 prior comments into a broader question about whether Biden had the ability to \u201cbe an effective commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI stand by that statement. He and I agreed on some key issues in the Obama administration, we disagreed significantly on Afghanistan and some other issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the vice president has some issues with the military, so how he would get along with the senior military and what that relationship would be,\u201d Gates continued. \u201cI just think it would depend on the personalities at the time.\u201d\n\nMattis, a former general who served as Trump\u2019s first defense secretary, echoed a similar sentiment in his newly released book.\n\nBiden \u201cexuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly,\u201d Mattis wrote when discussing the former vice president\u2019s strategy for the Iraq War.", "description": "Joe Biden portrayed himself as a foreign policy expert, despite his decades-long history of \u201cjudging the situation incorrectly.\u201d", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Biden-Laughing-Debate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
