Most people prefer to use private telecom operators and BSNL\u2019s expenses are rising rapidly whereas its income is falling drastically.\n\nIt was because of this that rumours of its closure in the near future had gained momentum in the last two weeks. According to a report in The Financial Express, the ministry has also rejected a proposal of the department of telecommunications (DoT) to pump in a massive Rs 74,000 crore to revive the two telcos.\n\nDon't Miss 19.3 K SHARES 16.1 K SHARES 10.3 K SHARES 3 K SHARES 2.8 K SHARES\n\nBSNL Chairman and Managing Director P K Purwar has, however, said that the salary of all BSNL employees will be paid before the upcoming festival of Diwali.\n\n\"BSNL has inner strength on the basis of which it is adding new customers.
