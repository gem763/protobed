While retirees might use dividend-paying stocks or funds to supplant a portion of their bond exposure, I get nervous when retirees use them to take the place of bonds altogether. And I think retirees should get nervous, too.\n\nWhat\u2019s Not to Like?\n\nFor retirees who would like to receive a component of their cash flows from organic income production, the appeal of dividend-payers is obvious. Although bond yields have come up over the past few years, yields from dividend-paying stocks remain competitive. While the S&P 500 barely pays out 2%, the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, composed of the higher-yielding half of U.S. dividend-paying stocks, yields about 3% today--right in line with the yield of the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index. Dividend-paying companies also have the opportunity to increase the dividends they pay out to shareholders; with a bond, the yield you see is the yield you get.\n\nDividends have composed a huge share of the market\u2019s return over time, so it stands to reason that dividend-paying stocks should be a meaningful component of every investor\u2019s portfolio--income-oriented or otherwise. And the ability to pay a dividend says a lot about a company's financial wherewithal and overall quality. Of the dividend-paying stocks in Morningstar\u2019s database, for example, 42% earn a financial health grade of B or better; just 20% of non-dividend-payers do. Yielders are also more likely to have sustainable competitive advantages: 43% of firms that pay out dividends have a narrow or wide economic moat, whereas just 29% of non-dividend-payers do.\n\nIn addition, yielders look more attractive than non-yielders when their valuations are factored in, a valuable attribute in a market that many view as overextended. Fully 23% of companies that pay dividends earn Morningstar Ratings of 4 or 5 stars currently, whereas just 11% of non-yielders do. That\u2019s a reflection of the fact that growth companies are less likely to pay dividends than value and blend names, and growth stocks have trumped value over the past decade.\n\nThe currently favorable tax treatment of dividend income also belongs on the list of what's right with dividend-payers. Qualified dividend income is currently taxed at just 15% for single filers with incomes of less than $434,550 ($488,850 for married couples filing jointly). Meanwhile, single filers with incomes below $39,375 and married couples filing jointly with incomes below $78,750 pay no taxes on dividends, assuming their incomes stay below those thresholds. Bond income, by contrast, is taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.\n\n\u2018Bad Losses in Bad Times\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s a long way of saying that dividend-payers have much to recommend them. But the obvious counterpoint is that the volatility profile of even a well-diversified basket of dividend-payers is much higher than bonds. Over the past 15 years, a period that captures the financial crisis, the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index has a standard deviation of 13, versus just over 3 for the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Index.\n\nBut many dividend aficionados tell me they\u2019re not so worried about volatility or even real losses. They feel comfortable with dividend-payers because they deliver the income they\u2019re looking for, plain and simple. If stocks increase in value as they collect that income, great; if they don\u2019t, the income will still be there and the stocks will probably recover eventually.\n\nBut I keep coming back to asset-allocation guru Bill Bernstein and his ultra-intuitive definition of risk--\u201cbad losses in bad times.\u201d What if something happens to dividend-payers\u2019 income production at the same time the portfolio drops in value? In that case, the dividend-oriented retiree\u2019s only choice may be to drop spending, venture into potentially riskier securities to help boost yield, or sell depreciated equities. From that standpoint, dividend-paying equities seem quite risky as a stand-alone retirement portfolio.\n\nThe financial crisis provides a perfect, albeit somewhat exaggerated, illustration of the risks of relying exclusively on dividend-payers for needed cash flows in retirement. Many banks, which had previously been a reliable source of dividends in the years leading up to the crisis, slashed their dividends because of business pressures. Banks\u2019 share prices, already under pressure with the rest of the U.S. market, tumbled because of the dividend cuts. SPDR S&P Bank ETF ((KBE)), for example, shed more than 80% of its value from peak to trough during the financial crisis, versus a 56% cumulative drop for the S&P 500.\n\nFor shareholders who were relying on dividends from their bank stocks, the dividend cuts and subsequent price drops were a double whammy. Not only did a source of their in-retirement cash flows dry up as yields were cut, but selling stocks to meet cash flows wasn\u2019t a viable option either. In other words, bank-focused dividend investors experienced bad losses in bad times.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s a worst-case scenario. Most sensible investors assemble dividend-payers from a host of different sectors, not just one. And indeed, most well-diversified dividend-focused funds and exchange-traded funds experienced losses that were no worse than the S&P 500 experienced during the financial crisis. (Dividend-growth funds like Vanguard Dividend Growth (VDIGX) and Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VDAIX)/and ETF (VIG) performed even better, but their yields aren\u2019t higher than the broad market\u2019s.) Moreover, the economy seems to be in decent shape, and there aren\u2019t any obvious storm clouds hovering over any one particular pocket of the dividend-paying universe.\n\nGetting It Done\n\nNonetheless, the experience of bank-stock investors during the financial crisis points to the value of building a contingency plan around a portfolio of dividend-paying investments. In a worst-case scenario in which dividend cuts occur around the same time those dividend-payers\u2019 share prices drop, the retiree has another source of assets he or she can tap to meet cash flow needs.\n\nWhile dividend-focused retirees needn\u2019t necessarily hold a full 10 years\u2019 worth of cash flows in cash and bonds, as is the case with my model bucket portfolios, holding at least a stake in such safe securities alongside the dividend-payers is a sensible practice. (How much depends on the retiree\u2019s own risk preferences.)\n\nAnd if dividend-payers are going to be a central component of your retirement cash flow plan, I\u2019d argue for keeping the composition of the nonequity portfolio on the high-quality, low-risk side. Because the idea of this portion of the portfolio is to hold its ground and possibly even gain if the dividend-payers encounter troubled times, focusing on cash as well as high-quality short- and intermediate-term bond funds helps further that aim. Such bonds\u2019 yields aren\u2019t particularly impressive right now, but they\u2019re apt to be a reliable source of ballast in periods of equity-market weakness.\n\nFinally, diversifying the risks of the dividend-paying stock portion of the portfolio is also key. While investors with very large portfolios may well choose to select individual dividend-paying equities, dividend-focused mutual funds and ETFs can provide a lot of diversification in a single shot. The key is to keep costs way down to ensure that more of the yield flows through to you rather than the fund company.", "description": "What you need to think through when building a retirement plan around income-producing equities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/blt8870afe34c82af68/5c76b9ca763b502362e52b21/ChristineBenz_1x1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-04"}
