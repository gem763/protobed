But he was not interacting with Ukraine experts at the State Department and Pentagon on the issue, and never had a conversation with Vindman, the NSC\u2019s director for Ukraine, about Ukraine \u2014 or about anything for that matter, Vindman testified.\n\nPatel joined the National Security Council\u2019s International Organizations and Alliances directorate in February and was promoted to a senior counterterrorism role around the same time as Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, in which he urged the newly elected leader to investigate Biden and \u201cget to the bottom of\u201d Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nPatel had previously served as Nunes\u2019 top staffer on the House Intelligence Committee and worked to discredit the FBI and DOJ officials investigating Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nFor that reason, Vindman was careful to not overtly criticize Patel so as not to anger Nunes \u2014 the ranking member of the intelligence panel \u2014 who floated in and out of the 10-hour deposition, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\nVindman, a combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient who has served in the Army for more than two decades, joined the White House in July 2018 as a detailee from the office of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He testified on Tuesday wearing his uniform, in keeping with past practice for active members of the military.\n\nHis opening statement \u2014 in which he testified that he raised alarms internally about efforts to pressure Ukraine into launching political investigations in exchange for military assistance aid \u2014 made him an immediate target of Trump\u2019s allies, who began floating a conspiracy theory late Monday night that Vindman was working as a double agent for both the Ukrainians and the United States.\n\nCiting Vindman\u2019s birthplace \u2014 the Soviet Union \u2014 and a New York Times report that said Vindman met with the Ukrainians periodically to discuss how they should deal with Giuliani, Republicans began publicly questioning where Vindman\u2019s loyalties lie.\n\n\"It seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d former GOP congressman Sean Duffy said on CNN on Tuesday morning. \u201cI don't know that he's concerned about American policy.\u201d Fox News host Laura Ingraham posited that Vindman was \u201cadvising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president\u2019s interest,\u201d leading former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo to respond, \u201csome people might call that espionage.\u201d\n\nThe talking point has been condemned by members of both parties as a smear of a decorated war hero. House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming called it \u201cshameful\u201d on Tuesday. Vindman\u2019s wife called her later that day to express her appreciation, and Cheney again denounced the smear, according to two people with knowledge of the call.\n\nDespite the bipartisan outcry, the insinuation made its way to the deposition room. At one point, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) began asking questions implying that Vindman had been working both sides, expressing alarm that Vindman \u201cgave the Ukrainians guidance\u201d and asking how many times he spoke with Ukrainian officials, one of the people in the room at the time said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s literally part of Vindman\u2019s job as the NSC\u2019s Ukraine director,\u201d this person said. \u201cZeldin was pretty quickly rebuked over that line of questioning by the Democrats.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Zeldin\u2019s office denied that he had implied Vindman had dual loyalties. \"This is just another reason why these transcripts should be immediately released,\" the spokesperson said. \"You\u2019d see just how badly your sources are misleading you about what\u2019s actually happening behind closed doors.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. John Ratcliffe also challenged Vindman \u2014 who wrote in his opening statement that he was concerned by Trump\u2019s July 25 call because he \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen\u201d \u2014 to show the investigators where the word \u201cdemand\u201d appeared in the call record.\n\nVindman explained that he considered the request to implicitly be a demand, because it was the president of the most powerful country in the world asking for \u201ca favor\u201d from a much lesser world power, according to the people familiar with his testimony. He compared it to how he would take it, as an Army officer, if a general asked him to do something.\n\nMelanie Zanona contributed.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/75/c3/f1982a2a40e193c02a4f4d7a49a3/191030-kash-patel-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
