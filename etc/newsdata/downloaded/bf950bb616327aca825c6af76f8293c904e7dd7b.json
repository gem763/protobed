JPMorgan Veteran Refuses to Buy \u2018Insane\u2019 Negative-Yield Bonds\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Lots of investors chafe at the idea of buying negative-yield bonds. Few are as repelled by the prospect as William Eigen.\n\nThe JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Asset Management fund manager says he\u2019d retire before buying sub-zero securities, even as some of his peers profit from the trade amid mounting fears of a global recession. He predicts negative-yielding bonds will eventually lead to \u201cdevastating\u201d losses and has parked almost half of his fund in cash that will be insulated from a market sell-off.\n\n\u201cThe whole concept of negative yields, of people paying for the privilege of lending money, is insane behavior to me,\u201d Eigen, a 29-year industry veteran who oversees the $12.5 billion JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Strategic Income Opportunities Fund, said in an interview from Boston. \u201cI do not pay to lend money. That\u2019s not fixed-income investing, that\u2019s fixed-loss investing.\u201d\n\nEigen says investors will ultimately face a train wreck in a market distorted by vast amounts of negative-yielding debt spurred by years of ultra-loose monetary policy from Europe to Japan. Some $13.4 trillion of securities now trade with sub-zero yields as several European central banks and Japan slashed rates to below zero after the financial crisis in a bid to spur growth.\n\nThe measures, including the European Central Bank\u2019s enormous bond-buying program, were meant to be temporary, but Europe\u2019s benchmark rate has persistently stayed below zero since 2014. The value of negative-yielding bonds has surged 61% this year, triggered in part by fears of a prolonged U.S.-China trade war.\n\nEigen said he\u2019s shunning the debt even as he predicts a recession in Europe and a \u201cpretty rough\u201d slowdown in the U.S., which would normally be a good time to buy bonds.\n\nHe gave three reasons: bonds are already pricing in bad times. And you can only make a capital gain from negative-yielding debt \u201cif someone crazier than you is willing to come in to pay more for the privilege of lending money to an over-levered government or a company.\u201d\n\n\u2018Devastating\u2019 Losses\n\nBut most importantly, nothing about the current bond market is sustainable, according to Eigen. Sooner or later, it\u2019s going to crash, and he wants to be there with dry powder when it happens.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that you print this much money, you put trillions of dollars of securities on your balance sheet, at some point something\u2019s going to break,\u201d Eigen said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to be in the short term, but man, when this thing breaks, the losses fixed-income investors will be facing will be devastating, and it\u2019s my job in that environment to post positive returns.\u201d\n\nEigen\u2019s fund, which aims to outperform cash, has returned 3.2% in 2019, above the effective Federal Funds rate of 1.75% to 2%. But he\u2019s also trailing behind peers who buy low or negative-yielding bonds: the Bloomberg Barclays (LON: ) Global-Aggregate Total Return Index has gained 6.2% this year.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone as bond bears have underperformed this year, with even heavy hitters such as Dan Ivascyn\u2019s Pimco Income Fund and Ray Dalio\u2019s flagship investment losing out amid a global rally.\n\nIt\u2019s not just sub-zero rates in Europe that are raising Eigen\u2019s wariness. An automotive enthusiast with a penchant for fast Italian motorcycles, he takes his cues on the economy from customers at two commercial garages that he partly owns in central Massachusetts. Eigen\u2019s not liking what he\u2019s hearing as the 2020 presidential election draws near.\n\nNervous Customers\n\n\u201cI see some of our bigger buyers and the bigger customers getting really nervous,\u201d he said. Elections \u201chave become so polarized here in the U.S. that that can\u2019t be good for confidence, and confidence drives the economy.\u201d\n\nThe cocktail of risks is prompting Eigen to favor cash and highly liquid assets. His strategy, which can invest in or bet against almost anything in the fixed-income universe, has 21% parked in investment-grade corporate debt. He also favors non-agency mortgages.\n\nJunk bonds now make up less than 5% of the fund from as high as 70% three years ago. While Eigen profited last year from shorting five-year German government debt, he\u2019s not willing to repeat the wager today.\n\n\u201cMy feeling is that rates can probably get a bit lower here in the U.S. and German rates will probably follow,\u201d he said.\n\nEven predictions of a further rally in U.S. Treasuries aren\u2019t enough to whet his appetite. His portfolio is \u201cabout as defensively positioned as it\u2019s ever been\u201d and he\u2019s building a war-chest of cash to deploy when bond markets sell off. And in the meantime, even if he loses out on some returns, he won\u2019t be buying securities with negative yields.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t engage in that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe day I buy a negative-yielding security is when I\u2019m retired. I don\u2019t do that for investors. If people want to lock in losses they can do it all by themselves.\u201d", "description": "JPMorgan Veteran Refuses to Buy \u2018Insane\u2019 Negative-Yield Bonds", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC3C0IL_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
