Here are the airlines to fly, according to The Points Guy", "language": "en", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nLooking to travel by air with your family? One popular frequent flyer website says your best option is JetBlue.\n\nThe Points Guy, an online site dedicated to helping frequent flyers maximize their travel benefits, recently released a study ranking all of the major U.S. airlines in how they accommodate families. The Arizona Republic, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network, reported this story.\n\nThe Points Guy said JetBlue topped the list thanks to \"large comfortable seats, built-in free entertainment, unlimited free snacks, free Wi-Fi, the ability for families to pool miles together at no charge and an easy-to-use frequent flyer program.\"\n\nJetBlue edged out popular carrier Southwest, which The Points Guy site docked slightly because travelers can't book flights far in advance. While many airlines release schedules 330 days in advance, Southwest typically releases its schedule about 180 days in advance. It posts when it plans to open its schedule on its website.\n\nUltra-low-cost carrier Allegiant Airlines took the bottom spot. The site complimented the Las Vegas-based carrier for its \"unique route network.\" However, it penalized Allegiant for lacking \"kid-friendly snacks and meals, complimentary seat assignments, on-time arrivals and entertainment (unless you sign up for their co-branded credit card).\"\n\nHmm:Don't want to sit by a baby on your flight?
