Super, super Fran! Super, super Fran! Super Frannie Kirby!\u201d\n\nThe fans have had many games to perfect such a simple chant. Sunday was Kirby\u2019s 100th appearance for Chelsea since she joined in 2015.\n\nSince scoring on her debut against Birmingham, the 26-year-old England forward has put away 65 goals for the Blues, netting 18 last season. She even scored the club\u2019s first ever Champions League goal when they played Glasgow City.\n\nShe won the double when she first joined, and again in the 2017-18 season. Could Chelsea possibly be on track for another this season? Their 3-1 win over West Ham on Sunday meant that they are currently the only unbeaten team in the WSL. If they hadn\u2019t drawn with Brighton in the second game of the season it would have been a perfect start for the Blues.\n\nAfter reaching the milestone at the weekend, Fran said: \u201cIt\u2019s really special for me \u2013 I think I\u2019ve spent a long time injured so it\u2019s nice to get that 100, but I\u2019m more happy that we got the win, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s been another busy weekend of women\u2019s football, from wonder goals and individual milestones to trophies and trademark celebrations.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Alan Tyers", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000212931432-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXW61vz_3bSmK0KpgrSXHYYrempWLTe02qz9Fy_-wUAM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
