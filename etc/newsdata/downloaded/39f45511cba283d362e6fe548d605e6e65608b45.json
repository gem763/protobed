He had a car and he asked if he could go into my field. I said \u2018yes that\u2019s fine\u2019.\n\n\u201cI did not think there was anything wrong about it. I saw his car there on a number of other occasions. When he came with the coins he was on his own. He said he had found something and he gave me three coins.\n\n\u201cI never saw the other man until a long time after. The man said he thought they found something of value and I never thought any more about it.\u201d\n\nShe said at one point she saw photos of the jewellery found but was not sure who had shown them to her.\n\nThe jury also heard from Mrs Conod\u2019s son Mark, a tenant farmer who farms Eye Court Farm, consisting of 208 acres of land belonging to Lord Cawley.\n\nHe told the court Mr Powell also approached him to ask if he could use his detector at the farm, which is used for dairy and crops including maize, in May 2015.\n\nMr Conod said Mr Powell dropped off some coins he said he found with his wife Amanda, and told them he had found something of value on his mother\u2019s land.\n\nHe claimed Mr Powell had sent photos of a bracelet and ring, but never showed him the items and did not disclose the 300 coins they had found.\n\nMr Conod said: \u201cIn May time [2015] I spoke to someone about metal detecting on the land I farm. It was one person, a stranger.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018yes\u2019 at the time. I described to him which fields he could go on. I saw him once in a field after that. He was just on his own with a metal detector.\n\n\u201cA couple of weeks after, he showed me some coins he found. He left them with my wife. He was on his own when he came to the house with the bits and pieces. He sent pictures.\n\n\u201cI only heard from him again when he said he had found something on mum\u2019s field. He said he found a bracelet and a ring. He never showed us the items. He never told us about coins.\n\n\u201cHe said he had reported them to a museum. I presume they were in a museum. He did not produce them.\n\n\u201cHe said they [the ring and bracelet] were Anglo Saxon and he was excited. I did not know if they were valuable, I didn\u2019t have a clue. It was mum\u2019s field where he said he found it.\u201d\n\nThe court previously heard the defendants deliberately concealed the find so they could cash in on the fortune and pocket the proceeds.\n\nThe hoard was estimated to have been hidden in the ground more than 1,100 years ago and came from two separate areas of England.\n\nMr Powell, of Newport, and Mr Davies, of Pontypridd, have pleaded not guilty to theft. Along with Mr Rumney, of Cardiff, and Mr Wicks, of Hailsham, all four deny conspiracy to conceal criminal property.\n\nMr Powell, Mr Davies and Mr Wicks are also charged with conspiracy to convert criminal property by selling it.\n\nThe trial, which is due to last a month, continues.\n\nSWNS", "description": "A metal detectorist\u00a0who dug up \u00a33m worth of ancient buried treasure only handed over three \u201cnot particularly valuable\u201d\u00a0coins to the owner of the land where it was found, a court heard.
