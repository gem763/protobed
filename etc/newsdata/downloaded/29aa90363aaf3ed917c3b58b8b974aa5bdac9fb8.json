The star of Clueless, Anchorman and Knocked Up is blaming social media for creating a hostile climate. \u201cYou hear some comics that used to play colleges all the time. They don\u2019t want to do that any more, because there\u2019s no room for any kind of daring comedy. Everybody\u2019s gonna be p***ed off about something. And that\u2019s\u2026 a drag.\u201d\n\nSurely there\u2019s still plenty of room for daring comedy? \u201cABSOLUTELY there is!\u201d he yelps. \u201cAnd also, there\u2019s more of a conversation about how something might be interpreted. Being aware of how a person might feel marginalised because of their sex, or because of their sexual preference, or because of their sexual identity\u2026 there are conversations happening now that have never happened, and that is incredible. It\u2019s a great, great thing. It\u2019s an awesome thing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a little confused. Did two entirely different people just answer the same question? It seems quite an innovative way to sit on the fence. But perhaps it is an after-effect of filming the show we\u2019re here to discuss. Rudd plays two roles in Living With Yourself, the new Netflix comedy drama about a man, Miles, whose illegal \u201cspa\u201d treatment goes badly wrong. One is dejected, lethargic, lugubrious. The kind of person who feels jealous of the fly he\u2019s just swatted. The other is upbeat, optimistic, effusive. The kind of person who hangs his head out of the car window just to revel in being alive. The thing is, they\u2019re the same man \u2013 cloned.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe show is dark \u2013 the very first scene involves Rudd bursting naked and hyperventilating from a shallow grave. \u201cFilming that was awful,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever had to film. I\u2019m not so claustrophobic really, but something within us knows that it\u2019s not the right thing to be buried alive. There was a tube that went underground so I could breathe.\u201d He filmed the scene in a public park. Did people walk past? \u201cYeah! But that\u2019s the great thing about New York. Somebody getting out of the ground in a diaper is the third weirdest thing they\u2019ve seen that day.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the show\u2019s also very funny. It\u2019s the perfect role for Rudd, who is an eminent everyman \u2013 or, at least, the type of star who convinces you he\u2019s an everyman while exuding charisma and an egoless confidence. You\u2019re never quite sure whether you\u2019re laughing with his characters, or at them. Or if maybe the joke\u2019s on you.\n\nThe Rudd I\u2019m speaking to today in a London hotel most closely resembles Miles 2.0: self-assured, high energy and possessed of a puppyish enthusiasm that often causes him to shout mid-sentence. Extinction Rebellion protestors were blocking the road on his way here, \u201cso I just jumped out the car and ran\u201d, he says chirpily. Rudd didn\u2019t mind being delayed by climate activists \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s really important, you know?\u201d \u2013 and is resolutely unruffled by the last-minute dash, dressed in an ocean blue suit and starched white shirt, with coiffed hair and the fresh face of someone about a decade younger.\n\nIt\u2019s become a bit of a thing, in fact, how young the 50-year-old looks \u2013 almost as young now as when he broke out 24 years ago, as Cher Horowitz\u2019s step-brother / love interest Josh in the 1995 romantic comedy Clueless. When he first played Marvel superhero Ant-Man \u2013 a role, most recently reprised in this year\u2019s Avengers: Endgame, which brought him to a new level of fame \u2013 he was already 46. There are memes, viral tweets and BuzzFeed quizzes, all based around his Dorian Gray-ish looks. But Rudd, it seems, is a little embarrassed about the whole thing. When he was asked about it in a recent New York Times interview, he bristled: \u201cI\u2019m aware\u2026 There\u2019s nothing really to say about it.\u201d Today, I\u2019m politely asked not to bring it up.\n\nEverything else is on the table, though. How does he feel about the increasingly blurred line between film and TV? Some people think it\u2019s damaging the sanctity of cinema. Others think that Marvel films are doing that. \u201cWow,\u201d says Rudd. It\u2019s true. Martin Scorsese said it the other day. \u201cAt the end of the day, I think any actor just wants to work on something they like. The material\u2019s good, the writing\u2019s good, the character\u2019s interesting. People watch their movies on TV now. People watch their movies on phones now. So this was just, \u2018This is an interesting character. The themes are really unique. I like the material.\u2019 I\u2019m not thinking of it anywhere beyond that.\u201d\n\nRudd empathised with the original Miles more than you might expect. \u201cIt\u2019s relatable why he\u2019s going to a \u2018spa\u2019,\u201d says Rudd. \u201cHis marriage is not in the best place, he\u2019s not doing so well at work, everything in his life has been better, and he\u2019s stuck. I think that\u2019s something we all experience at different points in our life. We go to therapy, we want to go to the gym, we want to do everything we can to try and improve our mood, try and improve our appearance, try and improve everything.\u201d\n\nHaving a clone doesn\u2019t really improve things, though. And there are moral repercussions to Miles\u2019s behaviour. Not least when it comes to his wife Kate (Aisling Bea), who calls his actions \u2013 and his subsequent decision to hide them from her \u2013 a \u201cviolation\u201d. \u201cDid I take on the ethical implications?\u201d he says when I ask about that line. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 I approach it as what the characters would think, and not so much what me, the human being, would think. Like, how do I feel about cloning in general? That was not my concern. I\u2019m not the guy to ask!\u201d\n\nStill, as someone who has a public self and a private one, Rudd must have identified with a character whose personhood is split in two. There\u2019s a 10-second pause. \u201cI suppose there really is a parallel,\u201d he says, slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s true. The private self is who I am. But the public persona is also part of who I am. But they don\u2019t have the same kind of battle scars. It\u2019s certainly different in my real life, because the things that I deal with are life things. Real life things.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off \u20ac2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show\u2019s 15 episodes than there are hostages. Netflix 2/20 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u20132018) Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It\u2019s been cancelled now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email. Netflix 3/20 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV \u2013 the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh \u2013 One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn\u2019t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran / nurse / single mother \u2013 who suffers from PTSD and depression \u2013 would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process. Netflix 4/20 Private Life (Film, 2018) Based on writer / director Tamara Jenkins\u2019s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie\u2019s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It\u2019s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised. Netflix 5/20 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep dive into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show\u2019s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly \u2013 and seemingly disastrously \u2013 changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones; Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig\u2019s wonderful turn as a talking vagina. Netflix 6/20 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016\u2013) Joe Swanberg\u2019s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you\u2019ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams \u2013 who you might remember from Todd Solondz\u2019s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness \u2013 is the show\u2019s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul. Netflix 7/20 Love (TV series, three seasons, 2016\u20132018) Community\u2019s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely \u2013 and arguably deeply unwise \u2013 relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus\u2019s pathological need to be the nice guy, we\u2019re never quite sure who or what we\u2019re rooting for \u2013 which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing. Netflix 8/20 Patton Oswalt: Annihilation (stand-up special, 2017) In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cstand-up special\u201d, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone. Netflix 9/20 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) Granted, this horror-comedy \u2013 which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh \u2013 is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it\u2019s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila\u2019s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair\u2019s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn\u2019t quite like anything else on TV right now. Netflix 10/20 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is \u2013 in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he\u2019s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier\u2019s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world\u2019s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier\u2019s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims. Netflix 11/20 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) Based on Vikram Chandra\u2019s epic 2006 novel, Netflix\u2019s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games \u2013 which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster \u2013 only covered one quarter of Chandra\u2019s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d. Netflix 12/20 Dumplin\u2019 (Film, 2018) When the trailer for Dumplin\u2019 first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin\u2019 such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described \u201cfat girl\u201d who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin\u2019 is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist \u2013 and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot. Netflix 13/20 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) This sci-fi thriller \u2013 which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties \u2013 has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things. Netflix 14/20 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017) Though it\u2019s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015\u2019s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992. Netflix 15/20 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018\u2013) This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 \u2013 meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward\u2019s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life. John O Flexor/Netflix 16/20 Set It Up (Film, 2018) Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term \u201cover-dicking\u201d (it\u2019s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre. Netflix 17/20 Cargo (Film, 2017) Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable spanners in the works. Netflix 18/20 3% (TV series, two season, 2016\u2013) Like a cross between The Hunger Games and CW series The 100, this Brazilian dystopian thriller, set in an unspecified future, revolves largely around an impoverished community known as the Inland. Every year, each 20-year-old takes part in a series of tests; the highest scoring 3% will be chosen to live in paradise in the Offshore. It is an intriguing and addictive commentary on class and privilege. Netflix 19/20 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) With shades of John Ford's The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it's about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws\u2019 pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O\u2019Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O\u2019Connell, are on brilliant form. Netflix 20/20 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness \u2013 as too many shows tend to do \u2013 it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season. Netflix 1/20 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017\u2013) Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix\u2019s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don\u2019t let that, or the show\u2019s bland English-language title, put you off \u2013 creator \u00c1lex Pina has made something special.

A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O\u2019Connell, are on brilliant form. Netflix 20/20 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017\u2013) This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness \u2013 as too many shows tend to do \u2013 it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season. Netflix\n\nRudd, who was born in New Jersey to British parents, has been married to publicist and screenwriter Julie Yaeger, with whom he has two children, since 2003. But even as his star has risen, Rudd has managed to largely avoid tabloids and gossip columns \u2013 perhaps thanks to his un-Hollywood, unchanging relationship. \u201cIn my private life,\u201d he continues, \u201cI\u2019m dealing with all the scars and traumas and real stuff from living my real life. When I\u2019m in public, I\u2019m giving a very filtered, smooth version of it.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not fake? \u201cI mean, it might be,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThere is just a natural, inauthentic version that\u2019s gonna have to happen. I\u2019ve never done an interview where my guard is down. It\u2019s just unavoidable. I can answer a question truthfully, but it\u2019s always with a lens that it\u2019s either gonna get read, or it\u2019s gonna get seen, and it just changes by nature. I\u2019m never totally relaxed. And while I\u2019m not trying to manipulate what you get, I guess maybe on some level, it is just a manipulation, and it\u2019s inauthentic.\u201d I\u2019ve never heard someone declare their inauthenticity with such sincerity.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing, though, that Rudd\u2019s private and public selves have in common: humour. \u201cI have always felt like jokes can help a situation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we all just remember to laugh. Because life\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nLive With Yourself is streaming on Netflix from Friday", "description": "It\u2019s a tough time for comedy,\u201d says Paul Rudd.

They don\u2019t want to do that any more, because there\u2019s no room for any kind of daring comedy. Everybody\u2019s gonna be p***ed off about something.
