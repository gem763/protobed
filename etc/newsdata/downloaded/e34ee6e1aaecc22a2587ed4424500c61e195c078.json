Elizabeth Warren, both beat the president by double digits among Minnesota voters. Voters polled picked Biden over Trump by 12 percentage points, 50% to 38%.\n\nWarren, who attracted a large crowd at an August campaign rally in St. Paul, tops Trump 51% to 40%. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who places third in most national polls of the Democratic field, is ahead of Trump 49% to 40%.\n\nThe survey also asked voters about a hypothetical match-up between Trump and Minnesota\u2019s Klobuchar, who trails in the crowded Democratic field. The third-term senator finished ahead of Trump by the widest margin, 55% to 38%. The poll of 800 registered voters, conducted Oct. 14-16, has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.\n\nThe poll was conducted less than a week after Trump visited Minneapolis for a high-profile campaign rally as part of an emerging effort by a Republican nominee to carry Minnesota for the first time since 1972. Trump vowed an all-out fight to win the state, which he narrowly lost to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.", "description": "", "authors": ["Startribune.Com Trump-Trails-Top-Democrats-In-New-Minnesota-Poll", "Refresh True"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
