The flight, which travels 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers), lasts only 1.5 minutes in the air. The cost of a one-way ticket starts at 17 pounds (roughly $22).\n\nThat\u2019s a blip compared to the 19.5-hour flight that Australian carrier Qantas QAN, -0.50% QABSY, +0.67% is testing this week. The 10,000-mile nonstop voyage on a Boeing BA, -6.79% 787-9 from New York to Sydney will be the world\u2019s longest flight.\n\nThe title was previously held by the New York-Singapore route flown by Singapore Airlines SINGF, +3.31% . That trip takes nearly 18 hours \u2014 some 1,080 times longer than the Loganair flight, give or take a minute.\n\nThe Westray-Papa Westray route isn\u2019t the only short flight that Loganair offers. The journey between Eday and Kirkwall, another two of the Orkney Islands, takes a staggering 10 minutes to complete.\n\nLooking to take a short trip closer to home? United Airlines UAL, +0.70% operates the shortest flight in the continental U.S., a 16-minute trip between San Francisco and Santa Rosa, located in the Sonoma County wine region. (Sightseeing flight operator Greater Toronto Airways boasts the shortest flight in North America, a 10-minute route between Toronto and Niagara.)\n\nIn Hawaii, travelers can take a 15-minute flight between the Kalaupapa and Ho\u2019olehua airports on Moloka\u2019i for as little as $50 on Mokulele Airlines.\n\nOf course, flying is particularly bad for the environment \u2014 aircraft are responsible for 2.5% of total global carbon dioxide emissions. So travelers concerned about their carbon footprint may want to consider other means of travel \u2014 for instance, a 25-minute car ferry also runs between Westray and Papa Westray.\n\nThe U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS, +0.09% , which tracks airline operators worldwide, has dropped in value roughly 5% over the last three months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.95% and S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.39% are down 1.4% and .38% respectively over that same time.\n\nThis story was updated on Oct. 18, 2019.", "description": "One airline is currently testing what will become the world\u2019s longest commercial flight.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR930_logana_ZG_20181017102957.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-17"}
