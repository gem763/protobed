In his special, he labels those referred to by an ever-expanding acronym as \u201cthe alphabet people\u201d (Does he read Spectator A.M.?). He offers an interesting take on abortion: \u201cLadies, to be fair to us, I also believe that if you decide to have the baby, a man should not have to pay,\u201d he tells a stunned audience. \u201cIf you can kill this mother\u2014er, I can at least abandon him. It\u2019s my money, my choice.\u201d\n\nDespite the standup performance creating as big of a buzz as anything since Eddie\u2019s Murphy\u2019s Delirious, the joke police hate it. Atop Chappelle\u2019s two Emmys and Grammys, Harvard gave him a W. E. B. Du Bois Medal, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts announced plans to recognize him with a Mark Twain Award for American Humor. That was then. This is now.\n\nJust read the headlines: \u201cShock and bore: how Dave Chappelle lost his comic touch\u201d (The Guardian), \u201cYou Can Definitely Skip Dave Chappelle\u2019s New Netflix Special Sticks & Stones\u201d (Vice), \u201cI Get It, Dave Chappelle.

Rotten Tomatoes, which initially posted a zero percent fresh rating, now gives the special a 33 percent rating based on its curated presentation of critical appraisal. The audience rating? Ninety-nine percent.\n\nThe chasm between popular appeal and critical panning recalls the 2016 presidential election. The media waged an unrelenting negative campaign against Donald Trump that surely represented the largest in-kind political donation in history. The people rebelled. Our betters are worse at getting us to do as told.\n\nThe cultural guardians created taboos. They gave immunity to certain groups, people, and causes from becoming punchlines. They outlawed noticing difference. But comedy always crosses lines, mocks authority, and makes fun of difference. In the spirit of Monty Python ridiculing zealous clergy through the Spanish Inquisition or stuffy English bureaucrats through its Ministry of Silly Walks, Chappelle finds comedy in the humorless powerful. And the audience, conditioned by social pressure, nervously giggle before exploding \u2014 the end result of any great pressure. Like any act of subversion, it exhilarates.\n\nThe critics corrupt their purpose. They judge comedy not by the laughs it provokes but by its political implications. Given the guardians\u2019 push to shut down cake shops not over health concerns but because of the baker\u2019s religious views or to put football players on the cover of magazines based on their sexuality or their body\u2019s position during the national anthem rather than their on-field accomplishments, the rigid, cultish reaction of critics to a clearly hilarious performance should not surprise. People obsessed with politics allow it to govern their judgment. When Chappelle, in a 2017 special, ridiculed Donald Trump for attempting to rescue American jobs from China (\u201cSo iPhones can be $9,000?\u201d), supporters of the president not infected by this total-politics mindset laughed. Has politics become so total that audiences respond to a joke out of ideological solidarity rather than its inherent humor?\n\nThe crowd\u2019s response to Chappelle suggests otherwise. But guardians, slaves to paychecks and lacking the talent to survive professional suicide like Chappelle, succumb to social pressure by exerting obligatory social pressure in depicting the spectacular as a dud. In laughing so hard, their cultural lessers engineer an emperor-has-no-clothes moment, when not only do untouchables become punchlines but in a broader sense the joke police do, too. The people in the seats grasp the meaning of \u201csticks and stones.\u201d The hectoring professional reviewers, trying their best (and failing) to exile Chappelle to funnyman Siberia, do not.\n\nA totalitarianism so fragile that it thrives off of demanding apologies and constricting the bounds of humor falls by unapologetic comedy. Even tyrants knew enough to leave their court jesters alone.", "description": "Laughs never come so hard as when some authority \u2014 a vice principal, a parent, a coach \u2014 sternly lectures, \u201cThat\u2019s not funny!\u201d This in part explains the rolling-on-the-floor hysterics induced by Dave Chappelle\u2019s Netflix special, Sticks and Stones.
