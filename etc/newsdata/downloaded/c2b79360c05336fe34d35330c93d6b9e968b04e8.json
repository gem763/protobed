I\u2019ve always been independent but this situation \u2013 it\u2019s truly brought me to my knees.\n\nThey left graffiti all over the walls (Picture: Helen France/ Caters News)\n\nA knife was left sticking out the settee (Picture: Helen France/ Caters News)\n\n\u2018I was a trusting person, but I lost everything. I was even put on medication as I was anxious, battling depression, all whilst trying to live the dream I\u2019d saved up for so long.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelen claims the police and other official channels won\u2019t help her with the situation, while both her letting agent and UK solicitor have reached a dead end.\n\nThey told her tenants are protected under Spanish law, leaving Helen with no choice but to put the eviction notice through the courts at her own expense.\n\nHong Kong protesters fly kick policeman and then 'try to grab his gun'\n\nShe received an email from the housing agency on August 25 telling her they believed the squatters had finally left.\n\nHer friends have since launched a fundraising page to help fix the house, which they say needs a replacement kitchen, worktops, full rewire and repaint, \u2018at the very least\u2019.\n\nHelen said: \u2018This has been a nightmare and it\u2019s taken a physical toll on me. I poured all I had into the property and it\u2019s only now I\u2019ve realised that in Spain, the tenants\u2019 rights outweigh the homeowner\u2019s.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018Since coming out here to Spain, I\u2019m literally living hand to mouth. It\u2019s like living a nightmare, I feel so alone \u2013 I don\u2019t feel in control in any way.\n\nHelen is facing months of unpaid bills (Picture: Helen France/ Caters News)\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been to the police, and to the letting agency but it seems no-one knows what to do. The tenants have had an eviction notice, and that\u2019s it.\n\n\u2018Now, I feel like I\u2019m stuck with no help \u2013 I can\u2019t even afford the plane fare home. Living in Spain was supposed to be my dream, but it couldn\u2019t be any further from that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLetting agents Compass Property Services helped Helen find the tenants originally, but said they also encountered road blocks as they attempted to take them out.\n\nBlack woman shot dead in own home by white cop because her door was open\n\nCompany owner Peter James said: \u2018Helen signed with us in September 2017 and requested that we find a long term tenant, which we did in January 2018.\n\n\u2018Yet the tenants quickly stopped paying the bills and it was decided to inform the tenant that if they did not pay the outstanding bills then a letter of termination would be served.\n\n\u2018This was done when the tenant came to pay the rent but refused to pay for the electricity. A letter of termination was given on the spot giving the tenant one month\u2019s notice to vacate, as stated in the rental agreement.\n\n\u2018During the one month\u2019s notice we was in talks with Helen\u2019s solicitor and provided all the necessary and requested documents required for the solicitor to start the legal eviction process just in case the tenants did not vacate on the specified date.\u2019\n\nShe says the situation has affected her mental health (Picture: Helen France/ Caters News)\n\nHe continued: \u2018Unfortunately Spanish law leans heavily towards the tenant rather than the owner. This is a horrible on-going situation in which we will help in any legal way that we can.\n\n\u2018On average, 97 per cent of tenants are good, honest people but you do get the odd tenant that is not all that they seem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Anyone looking at buying abroad needs to make sure they have full understanding and aren\u2019t going in blind \u2013 they need to have their eyes wide open.\u2019\n\nYou can donate to Helen\u2019s fundraising page here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
