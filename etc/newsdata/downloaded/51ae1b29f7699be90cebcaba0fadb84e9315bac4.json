And a new report from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Frederick Cannon paints a far uglier scenario if the U.S. moves closer to the negative-rate environment of other developed economies.\n\nCannon\u2019s report was published Sept. 25 and included price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios based on KBW\u2019s earnings estimates for 2021, and also another set of P/E ratios based on a scenario under which the federal funds rate moves to a range of 0% to 0.25% by the end of 2020 and the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.60% \u201cgoes negative\u201d in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nWhile it may still seem far-fetched to have negative yields in the U.S., it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the federal funds rate target was 0% to 0.25% for seven years through Dec. 16, 2015. We can easily go back there and if demand for U.S. dollars continues to be strong, negative yields on the 10-year bond may even be likely, unless a significantly strengthening economy forces the Fed to change direction again.\n\nCannon also analyzed another scenario that combines low rates with a recession. But in this article we are only looking at numbers drawn from the negative-rate scenario, leaving out a recession.\n\nNegative interest rates would not only affect banks, they would also hurt most financial-services companies whose profits depend on the spread between what they pay for funding and what they earn on loans. Charles Schwab SCHW, -0.17%, the pioneering discount broker that is technically a savings-and-loan holding company, is a prime example. The company announced this month that it would cut 600 jobs, with CEO Walt Bettinger citing the decline in interest rates.\n\nAccording to Schwab\u2019s second-quarter income statement, net interest revenue totaled $1.61 billion, or 60% of total net revenue. Schwab\u2019s shares trade for 16.2 times KBW\u2019s current 2021 earnings-per-share estimate, but for 41.8 times the 2021 EPS estimate under the firm\u2019s \u201cnegative-interest-rate scenario.\u201d Under that scenario, KBW\u2019s 2021 earnings estimate for Schwab drops 61% to a dollar a share from $2.58.\n\nHere are the 20 financial-services companies in KBW\u2019s coverage universe whose earnings estimates would decline the most under the firm\u2019s negative-interest-rate scenario:\n\nThe much higher P/E ratios for many of these companies underline how dire the negative-interest-rate scenario could be. And these numbers don\u2019t even reflect the possibility of a recession to go along with the negative rates.\n\nHere\u2019s the same data for the \u201cbig six\u201d U.S. banks:\n\nCompany Ticker Closing price - Sept. 25 KBW's current 2021 EPS estimate KBW's 2021 EPS estimate under negative-interest-rate scenario KBW's 2021 EPS estimate decline under negative-interest-rate scenario P/E - current 2021 EPS estimate P/E - scenario 2021 EPS estimate J.P.
