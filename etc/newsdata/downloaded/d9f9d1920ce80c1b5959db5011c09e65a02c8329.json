He was experienced, however, in being the son of the vice president of the United States who, as luck would have it, \u201cwas serving as the Obama administration\u2019s point man on relations with Ukraine and rooting out bureaucratic corruption,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nJoe Biden must have been aware of Hunter\u2019s term on Burisma\u2019s board. Indeed, major news organizations raised serious questions about this arrangement.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden\u2019s new job at Ukrainian gas company is a problem for U.S. soft power,\u201d read a May 14, 2014, Washington Post headline. And a June 8, 2014 Fox News story was headlined: \u201cUkraine energy firm hiring Biden\u2019s son raises ethical concerns\u201d\n\nJoe Biden discussed his March 2016 showdown with Poroshenko in remarks before the Council on Foreign Relations, of which I am a member, on January 23, 2018.\n\nHunter Biden reportedly earned <a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com_-3Furl-3Dhttps-253A-252F-252Furldefense.proofpoint.com-252Fv2-252Furl-253Fu-253Dhttps-2D3A-5F-5Fwww.wsj.com-5Farticles-5Fbidens-2D2Danticorruption-2D2Deffort-2D2Din-2D2Dukraine-2D2Doverlapped-2D2Dwith-2D2Dsons-2D2Dwork-2D2Din-2D2Dcountry-2D2D11569189782-2526d-253DDwMF-2Dg-2526c-253Dcnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ-2526r-253DAA442jMvbCURPtZiNmMNtJBnripGQYCHw7-5FDqJFkmec-2526m-253DDe-2DFEGqnF4HtUN2nLwQeihuhg6bSf8zBeRKiR-5FV-5F-2DZ0-2526s-253DrB3gh8R67JgtKhIOtPAKv7qOVrkjXGgVnp0QSapmSG0-2526e-253D-26data-3D02-257C01-257C-257C44aa3c9c494c40ac349208d74155de8f-257C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa-257C1-257C0-257C637049709367848053-26sdata-3DrO2nujcNB-252Bc5-252BTcWegWVBGaduEa1ijjisyNY-252Fq5O5vU-253D-26reserved-3D0%26d%3DDwMF-g%26c%3Dcnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ%26r%3DAA442jMvbCURPtZiNmMNtJBnripGQYCHw7_DqJFkmec%26m%3DPuP-PbYqt-Hv3U4s6WOmdoR7UcL9dKfPuBfGl9FfSMI%26s%3DM0b3Ye1bMdvkitEX9zBIGGWeM4b3Utgj_xlqzGXv4hw%26e%3D&data=02%7C01%7C%7C913339a843a640e1f29908d74156728f%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637049711848429705&sdata=9c2GJ23zURKQE8DIoF%2F44NsjfKcKhfzgERqADRIWCLU%3D&reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">some $50,000 per month</a> for his services, although he had no expertise in gas production and didn\u2019t know Ukraine from Utah.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee,\u201d the former vice president explained about his mission to Kiev, per the CFR\u2019s transcript. \u201cAnd I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars,\u2019\u201d Biden continued. \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.\u2019 I looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----. (Laughter.) He got fired.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s actions reek of extortion and obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd President Trump is the bad guy?\n\nAlso, the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s current president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Biden\u2019s behavior supposedly is based on the complaint of a mysterious whistleblower.\n\nHowever, it now transpires that this supposed whistleblower is not an eyewitness or even an earwitness to the Trump-Zelensky conversation. So, rather than a whistleblower, or perhaps a dog whistle, this entire fandango \u2014 including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s just-announced impeachment inquiry \u2014 is fueled by merely an echo of a whistle. In other words, hearsay.\n\nConversely, Biden\u2019s incriminating words were neither overheard nor just transcribed. In fact, he said this on camera at an on-the-record CFR meeting. Video tape exists of Biden boasting about securing the dismissal of the man who was probing his son\u2019s possible graft.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSo, apparently it\u2019s a potentially impeachable offense for President Trump to raise Biden\u2019s possible obstruction of justice in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky, which Kiev\u2019s Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko called \u201clong, friendly\u201d and \u201cno pressure.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s perfectly OK that the former vice president, as he personally crowed, blackmailed then-President Poroshenko into firing the top prosecutor who was investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s possible graft.\n\nSuccessfully sacking one\u2019s son\u2019s prosecutor via extortion: This is the textbook definition of obstruction of justice.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf Democrats did not have double standards, they would have no standards at all.\n\nAnd, like a guy with a red-rubber nose and giant, floppy shoes who screams \"STOP CLOWNING AROUND!\" the Democrats, yet again, are doing what they do best: psychological projection.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DEROY MURDOCK", "description": "Joe Biden crowed about how he blackmailed the then-president of Ukraine into firing the top prosecutor who was investigating Hunter Biden's possible graft.", "authors": ["Deroy Murdock"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/23/694940094001_6088849525001_6088856518001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
