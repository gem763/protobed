This Wednesday, live music venue This Town Needs in Yau Tong will be hosting rising star A$AP Ferg, as well as some of the city\u2019s emerging talent. Young Post caught up with opening artists Tyson Yoshi, Akiko, and Txmiyama to talk all things rap.\n\nTxmiyama first made a name for himself in 2017, with singles 5AM Minibus and Chungking. He\u2019s spent the two years since teaching himself how to mix and master his music.\n\n\u201cMy sound is still Asian trap so it hasn\u2019t changed much, but my production got a bit better,\u201d says the rapper.\n\nVideo of TXMIYAMA - CHUNGKING \u91cd\u6176\u5927\u5ec8 (ft. SEVENPRIM\u0152 & Robby Runner) (prod. by pilgrim)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working my jobs, saving money for big moves in 2020,\u201d he adds, unveiling his plans to release an EP next year; a new music video called Do It for the City is also set to drop in the next couple of weeks.\n\nTyson Yoshi is just as busy, having dropped his debut album, and new single Right Here, last month.\n\n\u201cThe new single is a different style to all my other songs, so I really want to sing it live in front of all the fans,\u201d says the singer, who also performed a sold-out album launch show in August. \u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous at all for my own show. I nearly cried on stage because it felt like my dreams finally came true!\u201d he says.\n\nHong Kong-raised Filipino rapper Lazyboi Dri on music, speaking Cantonese, Chinese culture and where it all mixes together\n\nPerforming as a support act isn\u2019t as easy, though. \u201cI\u2019m super nervous every time I perform at other people\u2019s shows,\u201d he admits.\n\nAkiko, one of Hong Kong\u2019s youngest rappers, released his debut album Proud Of Being A Rapper back in June. Lead single Let Go already has more than 200,000 views on YouTube. As a newcomer, Akiko was surprised by the turnout at his album launch show, saying: \u201cThe party went beyond my expectations \u2013 I didn\u2019t think that there\u2019d be so many supporters willing to buy tickets.\u201d\n\nWith their next live show just days away, Txmiyama is excited and uneasy in equal measure. \u201cIt\u2019s huge \u2013 words can\u2019t describe it. I have real anxiety so I\u2019m really nervous for this \u2013 every time people bring up A$AP Ferg I get cold sweats, but I\u2019m going to practise like crazy, fill the venue up with the homies, and hopefully people will enjoy my set.\u201d\n\nVideo of TYSON YOSHI & TIAB - Right Here (Prod. MADBOII)\n\nAll three agree that this sudden boom in the hip hop scene needs to be nurtured if it wants to continue.\n\n\u201cI can definitely tell there\u2019s a lot more people paying attention to hip hop due to the Rap of China show, and younger generations grew up with YouTube, so it\u2019s easier for them to access hip hop or non-mainstream music,\u201d says Tyson Yoshi.\n\nTxmiyama sums it up best, saying: \u201cWhen I was growing up, all the acts would go to Macau, and everybody always skipped Hong Kong when it came to Asia tours; people should never forget what the scene was like 10 years ago or take this stuff for granted.\u201d\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "Local artists like Txmiyama, Tyson Yoshi and Akiko, who are supporting the American at This Town Needs, are making the most of rap's recent surge in popularity", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/5f86d2b4-e58a-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires124007.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
