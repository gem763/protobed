Reuters\n\nEarlier this month, a rematch without headgear was confirmed for November 9 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, and Paul has once again expressed his interest in entering the octagon and fighting McGregor.\n\nRead more: KSI and Logan Paul won't stream their boxing fight on YouTube because of piracy worries\n\nAhead of a press conference with KSI, Paul was asked by Fight Hub TV who McGregor should fight next.\n\n\"Me,\" he replied. \"I swear to God, yeah, I'll fight Conor. He's f------ punching old men in the face.\"\n\nMcGregor issued an apology on ESPN after footage of his throwing a punch at an older man in a Dublin pub was shared by TMZ in August.\n\n\"He did take it though!\" Paul said. \"He took the punch and then just drank his whiskey. Those Irishmen dude, those Irishmen ... wild.\"\n\nPaul added that he was \"obsessed\" with MMA. \"No offense to Eddie, I'm an MMA fan,\" he said of the boxing promoter Eddie Hearn. \"I want to do MMA after this. I wrestled in high school.\"\n\nWhile the YouTuber might fancy his chances against McGregor, it doesn't look as if he'll be challenging the man who beat the Irishman most recently \u2014 Khabib Nurmagomedov \u2014 anytime soon.\n\n\"I don't think Khabib's a human being,\" Logan said. \"I don't know where he came from, but in my eyes he's unbeatable,\" he continued, going on to mention Nurmagomedov's bout against Dustin Poirier earlier this month.\n\n\"Like, no offense to Dustin, but I didn't think Dustin would win and look what happened \u2014 it was pure domination.\"\n\nMcGregor announced his retirement from MMA earlier this year, but his return has been hinted at by the UFC boss, Dana White. It remains unclear whether he will actually fight again.", "description": "History is repeating itself as Paul previously challenged McGregor ahead of his first fight with KSI.
