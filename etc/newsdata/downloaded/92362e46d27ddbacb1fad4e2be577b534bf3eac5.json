The \u00a341,580-a-year Wellington College runs schools in Tianjin, Shanghai and Hangzhou while the \u00a344,346-a-year Dulwich College has two schools in Shanghai, one in in Beijing and Suzhou.\n\nMr Gaskell said that British private schools in China have been \u201cgrowing on steroids\u201d in recent years but they are now facing a crackdown by the authorities.\n\nISC Research conducted interviews with headteachers of 50 international schools in China, and found that they are now facing \u201cextraordinary scrutiny\u201d from officials.\n\nMr Gaskell told delegates at the Headmasters\u2019 and Headmistresses\u2019 Conference (HMC): \u201cPrivate schools have been subjected to increased visits and scrutiny. There is a backlash against the rapid increase in private schools in China, particularly from the big public schools where it\u2019s conceived that they have been simply creaming the best kids for their schools.\u201d\n\nHe explained that local education bureau officials have been visiting private schools in China to \u201cgather intelligence on structure and systems\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe view of some of the heads we interviewed is that they want to replicate these models in their own Chinese schools,\" he said.\n\nAny new schools planning on opening up campuses in China should \u201cbe ready for the bureaucracy, legislation and the regulation\u201d, he warned, adding: \u201cThere is no light touch, it is now highly intrusive.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, China announced that all schools would have to adopt a lottery system for places, raising concern among private schools that this will put an end to academic selection. It comes after an earlier ruling that private schools need to teach the Chinese national curriculum as well as whichever international qualifications they offer.\n\nMr Gaskell also said that Beijing is \u201cclearly worried\u201d about the number of Chinese students who go overseas to be educated.\n\nMainland China is the largest source of foreign-born pupils at British boarding schools, with numbers rising 10 per cent last year to just over 9,000.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese state is now looking at ways to curb number of Chinese families going abroad for education,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are keen to attract families, who have gone overseas for work and lifestyle opportunities, to come back to China.\n\n\u201cThere is a focus group investigating barriers to families returning from abroad, and one such barrier is deemed to be guaranteed access to high quality education.\u201d", "description": "The Chinese government is growing fed up with British private schools \u201ccreaming off\u201d the best pupils, a conference has been told.
