This is to limit the impact on victims' families and survivors of the attack and to help mitigate gratuitous publicity of Alek Minassian's views and alleged motivation. We have selected a brief excerpt of the video that adds some context and enhances understanding of what happened that day. Read more about our Journalistic Standards and Practices.\n\nHours after his arrest, Alek Minassian told a Toronto police detective he communicated with two mass murderers motivated by incel ideology and said the massacres they carried out inspired him to use a rented van \"as a weapon\" on Yonge Street.\n\nThese and other revelations come from a four-hour police video interview with Minassian after the then 25-year-old was charged with driving a van into pedestrians the afternoon of April 23, 2018, killing 10 and wounding 16. The video and a nearly 200-page transcript of the interview were only allowed to be released by the media on Friday, the deadline for appealing an Ontario judge's decision to lift the publication ban.\n\nThe Richmond Hill, Ont., man's case is set for a judge-only trial early in 2020.\n\nWhen asked in the video how he feels about the deaths and injuries, Minassian, clad in a white jumpsuit, tells Det. Rob Thomas, \"I feel like I accomplished my mission.\"\n\nMinassian answered the question in the same matter-of-fact tone he used throughout the interview, whether he was asked about his university course work or the events on Yonge Street that Monday afternoon.\n\nMinassian tells police he first started to \"feel radicalized\" after Elliot Rodger shot dead six people and injured 14 near a university campus in Isla Vista, Calif., and then killed himself in 2014 \u2060\u2014 four years before the van attack.\n\nTalking to other incels online\n\nMinassian told Thomas he and Rodger exchanged private messages on Reddit from January 2014 until three days before the Isla Vista attack in May 2014. At the time, online forums on the website 4chan were hotbeds for incels.\n\nIncels, also known as involuntary celibates, are an online brotherhood of men who say they are unsuccessful in their romantic attempts with women and often express extreme feelings of misogyny and hatred.\n\n\"We found each other very interesting,\" Minassian, speaking in the video, says of Rodger. \"We discussed our frustrations at society and being unable to get laid.\"\n\nMinassian told the detective that while he had been 'thinking and daydreaming' of taking some action for years, he only started planning the van attack about a month earlier. (LinkedIn)\n\nCBC News hasn't been able to independently verify Minassian's claim that he communicated online with Rodger and Chris Harper-Mercer, who shot dead nine people and wounded eight inside a classroom at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., in October 2015.\n\nIn the police interview, Minassian says he published a Facebook post the day of the van attack, pledging allegiance to the \"incel rebellion\" and praising Rodger, who Minassian considers the rebellion's \"founding forefather.\"\n\nNever had a girlfriend as he was 'too nice'\n\nOver the course of the police interview, Minassian says he has never had a girlfriend because he's \"too nice.\"\n\nMinassian says that after the attack by Rodger, he started \"thinking and daydreaming\" about taking action of his own and spent more and more time on incel-related online forums.\n\nHe also tells police he talked online with Harper-Mercer, who killed himself following the Oregon shooting as police officers arrived on the scene. Harper-Mercer had posted online about being an involuntary celibate.\n\nMinassian tells the Toronto detective that despite that abstract plotting, on the day he was arrested, \"the planning didn't occur until about a month ago.\"\n\nBooking the van rental\n\nMinassian says he phoned and booked a van rental through Ryder from Seneca College, where Minassian was a student, about a month before the attack.\n\nHe told police he decided on a 10-foot van because it would be \"big enough to have an effect but not too big that I can't manoeuvre with it.\"\n\nMinassian says he booked the van about a month before he drove it through Yonge Street, in the north end of Toronto. (Aaron Vincent Elkaim/The Canadian Press)\n\nHe goes on to say, \"The van was the perfect medium size to use as a, my weapon [sic].\"\n\nIn the month leading up to the attack, Minassian was wrapping up his bachelor's degree in software development.\n\nMinassian also tells Thomas he chose April 23 as the day to pick up the van because he felt \"it would be more symbolic if I had completed my exams.\"\n\nSplashed drink 'only reason' attack ended\n\nThat day in 2018, Minassian says, he picked up the van before 1 p.m., and drove about 20 or 30 minutes from the Ryder location to the Yonge and Finch area with only one thing \"burning\" in his mind.\n\n\"I'm thinking that this is it, this is the day of retribution,\" he tells Thomas.\n\nMinassian says he didn't really plan the attack for the Yonge-Finch area but instead \"started seeing a lot of people walking\" and decided \"it's time to go for it.\"\n\nHe goes on to describe speeding the van toward people, the van colliding with them and how \"some people get knocked down on the way, some people roll over the top of the van.\"\n\nThe accused also told Thomas \"the only reason I stopped my attack was because someone's drink got splashed on my windshield, and I was worried that I would crash the van anyways.\"\n\nWATCH | Minassian explains reasons for stopping the attack:\n\nWARNING: This video might offend and disturb some viewers. Alek Minassian explains to Toronto police Det. Rob Thomas what prompted him to pull over and park, bringing to an end the deadly van attack that killed 10 people. 0:27\n\nFrom there, Minassian says he had intended to die through suicide by cop and details his repeated attempts to have Const. Ken Lam shoot him by holding his wallet like a gun and telling Lam he had a gun in his pocket \u2014 a scene captured in a video circulated widely after the attack.\n\n\"Unfortunately, he didn't react,\" Minassian says of Lam, who was later widely praised for his non-violent handling of the arrest.\n\nPublication ban lifted\n\nMinassian's lawyer, Boris Bytensky of Toronto, had argued for a publication ban on his client's interview with police and all other pretrial documents until the trial. Bytensky argued that allowing details to be published would taint potential witnesses, a position supported by the Crown. Ontario Superior Court Justice Anne Molloy disagreed and ruled in August to lift the ban.\n\n\"It is hard to imagine a witness being called who will not already know that Mr. Minassian drove a van down a Toronto sidewalk killing and injuring many people,\" wrote Molloy.\n\nThe van attack left 10 people dead.

(Ben Shannon/CBC)\n\nMolloy had delayed lifting the publication ban to give the defence time to file an appeal of her decision.\n\nMinassian has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder.\n\nThe Yonge Street attack claimed the lives of:\n\nAnne Marie D'Amico, 30.\n\nDorothy Sewell, 80.\n\nRenuka Amarasingha, 45.\n\nMunir Najjar, 85.\n\nChul Min (Eddie) Kang, 45.\n\nMary Elizabeth (Betty) Forsyth, 94.\n\nSohe Chung, 22.\n\nAndrea Bradden, 33.\n\nGeraldine Brady, 83.\n\nJi Hun Kim, 22.\n\nThe trial for Minassian, who turns 27 in November, is scheduled to begin in February.", "description": "Hours after his arrest, Alek Minassian told a Toronto police detective he communicated with two mass murderers motivated by\u00a0incel ideology\u00a0and said the massacres they carried out inspired him to use a rented van \"as a weapon\" on Yonge Street.", "authors": ["Reporter", "Cbc Toronto", "Nicole Brockbank Is A Reporter For Cbc Toronto'S Enterprise Unit.
