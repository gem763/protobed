[ID:nL8N27F1LU]\n\n\n\n\n\nA BLOW TO HEZBOLLAH\n\nThe resignation is a major blow for Hezbollah, which is more deeply involved than ever in the affairs of Lebanese government and as keen as anyone to stave off deeper financial problems that could lead to a destabilizing currency crisis.\n\nAhead of the resignation, Nasrallah had twice said he was against the resignation of the Hariri government, suggesting that some of the protesters were financed by the group's foreign adversaries and implementing their agendas.\n\nThe post of prime minister must be filled by a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon's sectarian system, and while Hezbollah has Sunni allies, Hariri is seen as critical to navigating a way out of this crisis because of his international backing.\n\n\"This is a strong blow to Hezbollah. Its hands have now been tied,\" said a source familiar with Hezbollah's thinking. \"The biggest winner is Hariri.\"\n\nHariri entered this cabinet, his third, with the balance of power tilted against him and in favor of the heavily armed Hezbollah, which together with its allies won more than 70 of parliament's 128 seats in a 2018 election.\n\nHariri had lost more than one third of his lawmakers in that election, including some to Sunnis aligned with Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah allies, including the FPM of Bassil and Aoun, secured the lion's share of cabinet seats in Hariri's cabinet. Hariri clashed with Bassil, particularly over long-elusive reforms needed to plug gaping holes in the state finances.\n\nHezbollah forged its alliance with the FPM in 2006, winning an influential Christian friend as Lebanese politics was recast by the withdrawal of the Syrian government forces that had dominated the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.\n\nAs foreign minister, Bassil has consistently spoken in international forums such as the Arab league to defend Hezbollah and its possession of weapons. He is seen as a presidential hopeful.", "description": "After hitting a dead end in efforts to defuse the crisis sweeping Lebanon, Saad al-Hariri informed a top Hezbollah official on Monday he had no choice but to quit as prime minister in defiance of the powerful Shi'ite group.
