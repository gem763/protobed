Corbyn said he and other opposition legislators would focus on ensuring that Johnson abided by that law.\n\nAsked by reporters in New York on Tuesday how he planned to overcome that legal obstacle, Johnson simply ignored the question and insisted Brexit would take place on Oct. 31 come what may.\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said his preferred Brexit outcome would be to agree an exit deal with the EU\u2019s 27 other members before the deadline and that he was hopeful he would achieve that.\n\nRelated Coverage UK Labour leader Corbyn says priority is preventing no-deal Brexit\n\nHowever, EU negotiators say he has made no new proposals capable of breaking the deadlock over the issue of how to manage the border between Ireland, an EU member, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, after Brexit.\n\n\u201cBULL IN A CHINA SHOP\u201d\n\nAgainst that backdrop, reactions to the Supreme Court\u2019s blistering ruling among British politicians showed that divisions were deeper than ever.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons and one of the most ardent advocates of Brexit, was reported by British newspapers to have said during a conference call with Johnson and other cabinet members on Tuesday that the Supreme Court had carried out a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d.\n\nSenior cabinet minister Michael Gove was more moderate in public on Wednesday morning, telling several media that the government would respect the court ruling even though it \u201crespectfully disagreed\u201d with some of the justices\u2019 reasoning.\n\nJohnson himself was combative after the ruling, saying in New York that he strongly disagreed with it and complaining that too many people were trying to thwart Brexit against the will of the people.\n\nOn the other side of the divide, one of Johnson\u2019s own former cabinet members, Amber Rudd, said it would be irresponsible for the government to cast the ruling as an anti-Brexit move when Johnson\u2019s defense all along was that his decision to suspend parliament in the first place had nothing to do with Brexit.\n\nFormer minister Dominic Grieve, an influential member of parliament and an anti-Johnson rebel within the ruling Conservative Party, accused the prime minister of behaving \u201clike a bull in a china shop\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy judgment is that there\u2019s only one way out and that is to have a second referendum, because otherwise we\u2019re going to carry on going round in circles. But he\u2019s entitled to put other ideas forward if he thinks he\u2019s got them,\u201d Grieve said on Sky News.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson addresses the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City, New York, U.S., September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\n\u201cHe says he wants to get a deal but there\u2019s no evidence he\u2019s even started negotiating a deal with the EU and it\u2019s quite clear that the House of Commons and parliament will not accept leaving without an agreement because it\u2019s so damaging for the future of our country.\u201d\n\nOpposition leader Corbyn said in the BBC interview that once a no-deal Brexit had been averted, it would be appropriate to move a motion of no confidence to force the government to resign and then have a general election.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson was flying home on Wednesday as determined as ever to push through Britain's departure from the European Union but facing reinvigorated opposition to his plans after the Supreme Court ruled he had unlawfully suspended parliament.", "authors": ["Estelle Shirbon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433650832&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0C3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
