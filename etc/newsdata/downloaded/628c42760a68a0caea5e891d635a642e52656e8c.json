She placed responsibility on the news media to provide any necessary context.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a political officer that is making information that is really important for the constituents to see, or for other global leaders to see, that is content that we would leave up because we think it\u2019s important for other people to see,\u201d she said, as first reported by Politico.\n\nIt\u2019s important for political content to be seen, says @SusanWojcick of @YouTube at #TheAtlanticFest. pic.twitter.com/zwivjtklnU \u2014 The Atlantic Festival (@TheAtlanticFest) September 25, 2019\n\nIn general when YouTube makes its policies, it allows an exception for content that\u2019s educational, documentary, scientific or artistic (or EDSA), Wojcicki said.\n\n\u201cEven if we were to take it down it would be covered by all the news stories and the news is always going to provide that information and they\u2019re going to provide it with context,\u201d she added.\n\nA YouTube representative, in an email to HuffPost, denied that the streaming service treats politicians any differently but reiterated the EDSA policy exemptions, which they said include newsworthy videos.\n\nFacebook on Tuesday elaborated on a similar policy it has, explaining that if a politician shares content that has been previously debunked, it will be demoted on the site but not removed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe, however, that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny. That\u2019s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program,\u201d said Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications.\n\nTARIK KIZILKAYA via Getty Images Politicians enjoy exemptions from YouTube's policy rules because it's \"important\" for people to see what they have to say, YouTube's CEO said.\n\nEstablishing guidelines and restrictions has been a challenging frontier for social media sites, particularly when it comes to fake news stories going viral and online comments by public figures, including the president of the United States, seen as harassment or bullying.\n\nYouTube\u2019s current guidelines restrict content that contains nudity or pornography; that\u2019s harmful, dangerous, hateful, violent or graphic; or that harasses, threatens, scams or impersonates another channel or individual. Facebook has similar standards, as does Twitter.\n\nTwitter, which has long faced scrutiny over its content, announced back in June that it also won\u2019t hold politicians to its user guidelines, so long as the content shared is deemed to be of \u201cpublic interest,\u201d the politician\u2019s account is verified and the politician\u2019s account has more than 100,000 followers.\n\n\u201cThere are cases, such as direct threats of violence or calls to commit violence against an individual, that are unlikely to be considered in the public interest,\u201d Twitter said in a blog post.\n\nEarlier this month, Twitter removed a tweet by Texas Rep. Briscoe Cain (R) that threatened Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke with an AR-15 rifle. Cain\u2019s tweet did not appear to meet at least two of the exemption qualifications: It was a threat of violence and he has fewer than 100,000 followers.", "description": "Videos that violates the policies will not necessarily be removed because it is \"important for other people to see,\" said CEO Susan Wojcicki.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8bca681e00004b02724467.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
