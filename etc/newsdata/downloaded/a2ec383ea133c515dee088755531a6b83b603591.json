Here\u2019s a selection of some of the claims that caught our attention, written with my colleagues Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly. As is our practice, we do not award Pinocchios in debate roundups.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages; we didn\u2019t separate families.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Former vice president Joe Biden\n\nContrary to Biden\u2019s claim, the Obama administration did use caged enclosures beginning in 2014 to hold families apprehended along the southern border by U.S. authorities. There is photographic evidence showing the cages in 2014.\n\nMoreover, a former Homeland Security secretary under Obama, Jeh Johnson, has said that \u201cwe expanded family detention \u2026 I freely admit it was controversial.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Obama administration over this expanded detention program. \u201cLocking up families and depriving them of their liberty in order to scare others from seeking refuge in the U.S. is inhumane and illegal,\u201d Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said at the time.\n\nThe Trump administration also has been criticized for holding migrants in border facilities with cages. Biden was drawing a contrast between the administrations, but he erred when he said cages weren\u2019t used under Obama.\n\nHowever, Biden is on solid ground when he distinguishes President Trump\u2019s family separation policy from Obama\u2019s. Under its zero-tolerance policy last year, the Trump administration systematically separated all migrant families apprehended at the border.\n\nThe zero-tolerance approach is worlds apart from the Obama- and George W. Bush-era policy of separating children from adults at the border only in limited circumstances, such as when officials suspected human trafficking or another kind of danger to the child, or when false claims of parentage were made.\n\n\u201cWe have more African Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.)\n\nThere are several problems with this claim. First, as Booker framed it, it\u2019s simply wrong. The 1850 Census counted 3.6 million slaves. That\u2019s compared to African Americans constituting 2.3 million, or 34 percent, of the total 6.8 million correctional population in 2014.\n\nA Booker spokeswoman as evidence sent us a link to a 2014 PolitiFact fact check about a different claim \u2014 that more black men are now in prison than were slaves in 1850. \u201cIn total, there were about 1.68 million African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African American men who were enslaved in 1850,\u201d the fact check said, rating it \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Booker said.\n\nMoreover, even if the black men comparison is correct in terms of raw numbers, it\u2019s still misleading because the U.S. population has soared since 1850, as our colleagues at Wonkblog noted in 2015. The census that year found that roughly 9 in 10 of the nation\u2019s 3.6 million blacks were enslaved. By contrast, 1 in 11 blacks is under correctional supervision today, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\n\u201cOver 90 percent of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street \u2014 period.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Biden\n\nThis is wildly off base. Support for banning the sale of assault weapons usually ranges from 50 to 60 percent in recent surveys. It was 56 percent in The Washington Post-ABC poll released this week. Fifty-two percent in that same poll supported a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. A Monmouth University poll released this week found 43 percent supported a mandatory buyback program.\n\nBiden may have been mixing up the statistics for polling on expanding background checks, which does get support in the 90 percent range.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they\u2019re going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease \u2014 cancer or heart disease.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nCampaigning for universal health care, Sanders claims 500,000 people go bankrupt every year from medical bills or illness. That\u2019s about two-thirds of the 750,000 total bankruptcies per year.\n\nSanders\u2019s claim is based on a study published by the American Journal of Public Health in March. The researchers surveyed debtors and asked about factors that contributed to their bankruptcies. Forty-four percent said either medical bills or loss of work related to illness \u201cvery much\u201d contributed; 22 percent said either medical bills or illness \u201csomewhat\u201d contributed. Combining both groups of respondents, the study estimated 530,000 bankruptcies a year.\n\nBut the study doesn\u2019t establish that all 530,000 bankruptcies were caused by medical bills or illness, as Sanders describes it. The lead researcher behind the study says Sanders\u2019s claim might be on target when measuring only the share of respondents who said medical bills or illness \u201cvery much\u201d contributed to their bankruptcies. But those estimates are not in the study itself.\n\nA different study published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the same question of medical bankruptcies and found that the rate was far lower: 30,000 to 50,000 a year. However, this study was limited to non-elderly people in California who were admitted to the hospital for non-birth-related reasons, so it covers only a subset of all people facing medical debt.\n\nThe research team Sanders cited once included Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who contributed to earlier versions of their study when she was a Harvard professor. Interestingly, though, Warren doesn\u2019t appear to make the same claim about 500,000 medical bankruptcies a year.\n\nWe recently gave Three Pinocchios to Sanders for this claim, and his campaign sharply criticized our fact check.\n\n\u201cWe have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry. And unless we\u2019re willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, we\u2019re not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let\u2019s do background checks, let\u2019s get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\n\nIn 2013, after the Sandy Hook massacre, the Senate held separate votes on banning assault weapons and strengthening background checks for gun sales. Warren conflated them.\n\nThe bill on background checks got 54 votes, as Warren said during the debate, and fell prey to the filibuster. But the assault weapons ban received 40 votes from Democrats at a time when they held 55 seats in the Senate (counting the independents in their caucus), so the filibuster was not a factor in this case.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sanders\n\nSanders is right that United States, $9,892 in 2016, pays far more than per capita on health care than any other major country in the world \u2014 and that it\u2019s twice as much as Canada ($4,753). Moreover, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) median was $4,033. But Switzerland is a major developed country, and U.S. costs are 25 percent higher than Switzerland ($7,919). These figures come from a study from a team led by a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health researcher.\n\n\u201cOne forecast recently says that it [Trump\u2019s tariff war] has already cost us 300,000 jobs, all right?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)\n\nKlobuchar is referring to a recent estimate by Moody\u2019s Analytics that Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports from China have reduced U.S. employment by 300,000. The number reflects jobs eliminated by firms struggling with tariffs and jobs that were not created because of reduced economic activity. Without a change in policy, Moody\u2019s said, the job toll will hit 450,000 by the end of 2019 and 900,000 by the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason why in the last 45 years the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and worker productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nThis is a favorite line of Sanders. And one can make a case that it\u2019s accurate. The Pew Research Center, in a report titled \u201cFor most U.S. workers, real wages have barely budged in decades,\u201d said that \u201cAfter adjusting for inflation, however, today\u2019s average hourly wage has just about the same purchasing power it did in 1978, following a long slide in the 1980s and early 1990s and bumpy, inconsistent growth since then. . . . The $4.03-an-hour rate recorded in January 1973 had the same purchasing power that $23.68 would today.\u201d\n\nBut some analysts say it\u2019s not very useful to compare wages over such a long period of time. The picture looks better if one takes a different starting point. Wages are up nearly 20 percent since 1996, for instance.\n\nMichael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute wrote recently for Bloomberg that there is a better argument for \u201ccomparing today\u2019s wages with those of the early 1990s (or even more recently), rather than going back to the early 1970s, when many of today\u2019s workers were just children.\u201d\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "Here's a roundup of eight claims from the third Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 campaign.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker", "Salvador Rizzo", "Reporter For The Fact Checker", "Meg Kelly", "Video Editor For The Fact Checker", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/d9fEdKEcycYebJnCracrIwkzYfI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/55KN42GV2EI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
