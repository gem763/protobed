My path to abroad doesn't succeed. Mom, I love you so much! I'm dying bcoz I can't breathe,\" she said in the message confirmed by her brother Pham Manh Cuong.\n\nHe received another message from her on Wednesday saying: \"Please try to work hard to pay the debt for mummy, my dear,\" according to a text sent at 12:15 Hanoi time on Wednesday (0515 GMT) and seen by AFP.\n\nBoth suspected victims came from Ha Tinh, an impoverished province in central Vietnam where many of the country's illegal migrants come from.\n\nMany have their sights set on Britain, where they end up working in nail salons or on cannabis farms, hoping for quick riches.\n\nMany travel through Russia or China and often carry falsified documents for the journeys which can cost up to $40,000.\n\nThe 39 bodies were found on an industrial estate in Grays east of London early Wednesday.\n\nA 25-year-old Northern Irish man was arrested at the scene, while two British nationals were arrested Friday on suspicion of trafficking and manslaughter, Essex police said.", "description": "Another Vietnamese citizen is feared among the 39 people found dead in a truck in Britain this week, after his father told AFP Saturday he received a chilling call to say his son died en route to the UK.
