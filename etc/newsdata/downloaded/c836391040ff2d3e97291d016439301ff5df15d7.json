REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe Sunday Times has reported that when Johnson was mayor he failed to declare close personal links to Arcuri, who received thousands of pounds in public business funding and places on official trade trips.\n\nSpeaking to ITV, Arcuri said she had bonded with Johnson, who was mayor of the British capital from 2008-2016, over classical literature, that they discussed French philosopher Voltaire and shared a love of William Shakespeare.\n\nBut asked repeatedly whether she had an affair with Johnson or intimate relations with him, she either sidestepped the question or openly refused to answer.\n\n\u201cI really am not going to answer that question,\u201d Arcuri told ITV. \u201cIt\u2019s really categorically no one\u2019s business what private life we had or didn\u2019t have.\n\n\u201cAnd categorically more important, Boris never ever gave me favouritism, never once did I ask him for a favour, never once did he write a letter of recommendation for me.\u201d\n\nAsked about the allegations, Johnson has said everything was done with full propriety and that there was no interest to declare.\n\nThe Greater London Authority (GLA) said last month it had referred Johnson to Britain\u2019s police watchdog for potential investigation over allegations of misconduct involving Arcuri.\n\nThe GLA said the allegations were that Johnson had a friendship with Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed her to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship.\n\nThe crime of misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nArcuri told ITV that after they first bonded over literature and discussed venture capital for the technology sector, she and Johnson began sending text messages and then he would visit her office at her apartment in London, sometimes on his way home.\n\nIn her phone, she entered Johnson \u2014 whose first name is Alexander \u2014 as \u201cAlex the Great\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere was plenty of office space for him to come visit,\u201d Arcuri said. He visited around five or perhaps 10 times, she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was awkward at all.\u201d\n\nShe quipped that she once offered Johnson the chance to have a go on her dancing pole but he refused.\n\n\u201cHe sat down with his tea and started muttering,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen asked again about the nature of their relationship she said: \u201cBecause the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer model, I really am not going to answer that question.\u201d\n\nAsked if she loved him, she said: \u201cI care about him deeply as a friend and do we share a very close bond. But I wish him well, I want him to be happy.\u201d", "description": "U.S. businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri repeatedly refused to answer questions on Monday about whether she had an intimate relationship with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437982605&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9609V", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
