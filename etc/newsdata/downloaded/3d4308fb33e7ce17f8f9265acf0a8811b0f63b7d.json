'I think dogs can solve their problems.'\n\nAfter previously discovering tombs in an ancient cemetery in the Drvi\u0161ica hillfort, Professor Glava\u0161 contacted dog trainer Andrea Pintar, with the hope of being able to find out more, according to the Guardian.\n\nGood girl! While sniffer dogs are well-known for their use in criminal investigations, experts say they are currently under-utilised in archaeology\n\nProfessor Vedrana Glava\u0161 holds bronze buttons discovered during an excavation.\n\nMr Pintar brought three Belgian Malinois and one German Shepherd to the site \u2013 the dogs had previously been working to sniff out graves for criminal investigations.\n\nAll the canines were able to discover the location of all three graves that had already been located by a human team, even though the graves had been removed of human remains and artefacts.\n\nBodies laid to rest around 3,000 years ago lie in the ancient cemetery of the Drvi\u0161ica hillfort, in the Velebit mountains along the Adriatic coast, Croatia\n\nProfessor Glava\u0161 said the dogs were likely to have detected the aroma of decomposed bodies, which had likely been absorbed by the porous rock around the excavated soil.\n\nEven more impressively, the dogs accurately identified six new tombs that Professor Glava\u0161 was then able to excavate.\n\nThe newly discovered tombs consist of small stone burial chests, each containing small bones from human fingers and feet, as well as artefacts such as buckles.\n\nThe ancient inhabitants of the hilltop fort of Drvi\u0161ica most likely died impoverished, due to the windy conditions and the difficulty of growing crops.\n\nWhile dogs are frequently used to detect human remains in criminal investigations, their potential as four-legged archaeologists is yet to be fully explored.\n\nDogs also provide a cheaper and less destructive method of uncovering fragile burial sites than high-tech methods such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity, and remote sensing.\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory.", "description": "Croatian scientists have been using sniffer dogs to uncover ancient tombs dating back nearly 3,000 years, after realising the animals were able to detect ancient human remains.", "authors": ["Mailonline Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/10/20171800-0-image-a-19_1571994520847.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
