What started off as \u2018social\u2019 indulgence in marijuana, eventually graduated to hard drugs. What she thought was a one-off occurrence, soon developed into an addiction. \u201cWhen it started affecting his career\u2014he got thrown out of the newspaper he was working at\u2014I convinced him to check into rehab,\u201d she says.It helped him clean up for a bit, but before long, he had lapsed. Since then, it has become a vicious pattern, and each time Sen takes on the role of the primary caretaker, while her husband yo-yos between a new high-risk episode and an attempt to get sober. Sen\u2019s situation, however, is not a unique one. Surprisingly, it is one in which many women find themselves\u2014trapped in unequal relationships, where they are left to shoulder the burden of not only the relationship, but also a dependent, and often irresponsible, partner.It is interesting and ironic that in many such cases, where a partner has a chronic issue, such as an addiction, a mental health problem, a disability, or is plain irresponsible, the other partner, who is compelled to take on the role of the carer, feeds off the neediness of her partner. Over a period of time, she begins to rely on her partner for approval as well as her sense of identity. She takes on the responsibility of the partner at the expense of her own well-being. It\u2019s a complicated situation to be in. A few experts advise on how to get through it.Aparna Samuel Balasundaram, clinical psychotherapist and founder of lifeskillsexperts.com, says, \u201cThe term co-dependent is being used in relationship therapy to describe dysfunctional relationships, where one person\u2019s indulgence inadvertently \u2018enables\u2019 irresponsible behaviour in their partners,\u201d she says.On one hand, a partner is extremely dependent on the carer for social, emotional, and even physical needs. On the other hand, the carer\u2019s sense of purpose comes from the responsibility she has taken on for her partner, and therefore being needed by him. The relationship then takes a turn to becoming addictive. If you thought co-dependency was limited only to romantic relationships, think again. \u201cIt can occur in any type of relationship, including as a parent, spouse, or even in friendships,\u201d Balasundaram says.Why would someone willingly put up with this kind of behaviour? The answer lies in the kind of childhood that the co-dependent has had. \u201cResearch says when a child grows up in a family where a parent is dealing with alcoholism, mental illness, or any other extreme social, physical, or cognitive defects, the child is often forced to be \u2018overly responsible\u2019 and take on the role of caretaker. These children are likely to grow into adults who will have unhealthy co-dependent relationships,\u201d says Balasundaram. For instance, when Oindrila Paul*, a 32-year-old lecturer, was growing up, she had to deal with double trouble\u2014a mother who suffered domestic abuse at the hands of her father, and also fell prey to migraine attacks that had her incapacitated for much of the time. \u201cSo half of the time I was protecting her against my father\u2019s blows and getting beaten up in the process too, and the other half I played nurse,\u201d she says. The pattern continued into adulthood, with Paul ending up marrying a man with a severe alcohol addiction. \u201cSo, I am still cleaning up vomit, albeit now my husband\u2019s,\u201d she says.The signs to co-dependency are not readily visible since it is easier to believe in one\u2019s victimhood rather than see oneself as an equal participant in a dysfunctional relationship. Rachna Khanna Singh, HOD Holistic Medicine and Psychology, Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon, points out the first few signs. \u201cCheck whether your self-esteem is linked to being needed by another person. Furthermore, if this feeling of being wanted is so compelling that you are unwilling to end such a relationship just to feel important, take cognisance of it.\u201dAmong the other key signs of co-dependencyis \u2018enabling\u2019. Author Shawn Meghan Burn, Professor of psychology at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, in a blog post titled Personality and Relationships Made In Codependence Hell, says, \u201cUnhealthy helping often enables another\u2019s under-achievement, lack of responsibility, addiction, or poor mental or physical health. It tends to breed false dependence. It\u2019s unsustainable in the long run due to its consumption of our physical, emotional,or financial resources.\u201dDenial can really be a devil in disguise sometimes. Singh says acknowledging the fact that you are in a co-dependent relationship is the first step towards extricating yourself from the morass. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for a co-dependent to admit that she is, in a way, thriving off the neediness of the partner and getting a self-esteem boost. That proves to be the real obstacle to get out of such relationships. While other factors like a genuine concern for the partner may be at play, acknowledgement of what one is getting out of the relationship is also crucial,\u201d says Singh. Balasundaram suggests taking a zoomed-out view of the situation, to look at it in its entirity.\u201cAvoid moving from one extreme to the next. You cannot suddenly move from being a martyr to taking on an aggressive stance or completely becoming emotionally cold and stoic,\u201d she says.If you suspect that you may be in a co-dependent relationship, research and find out what kind of resources are available to you in the form of self-help books or counselling.Identify patterns of co-dependent behaviour on your part and start pulling yourself back. If you sense that he may become violent, call for help.Those in co-dependent relationships tend to shun outside help due to the perceived shame. There is also a misguided feeling that society is unfair and does not care. The only way you can get out of this is to seek the help of friends, family, and a professional expert.Trying to change the dependent partner is an uphill task. So focus on changing yourself. Don\u2019t waste your time waiting for the day your partner will turn over a new leaf. In fact, it may be better for you and your partner if you step back and let a professional take care of the substance habit or mental health issue. Put your happiness and well-being at the forefront.Don\u2019t let the anxiety for your partner stop you from living your own life. Stop taking responsibility for his actions, thereby empowering him but not sheltering him.The worst part about being in such a relationship is that you get so used to taking care of the other person that your well-being comes last. \u201cYou never live up to your potential. Usually people develop issues with trust and suffer from anxiety. They do not see themselves as worthy or lovable. They lend value to themselves only when they \u2018fix\u2019 someone else,\u201d says Balasundaram, who also shares the instance of a patient whose husband was into online poker. \u201cBesides losing family money, he used to drink and had issues with anger management. The wife felt responsible for his actions and would cover up in front of their kids and her parents. He often slapped her in a drunken state, and yet she would find herself making excuses for him, transferring the blame upon herself for provoking him,\u201d she says.Violence is one of the many side-effects of co-dependency, which spells danger not only for you, but also your children.Here\u2019s a quick check-list created by Balasundaram to help you figure if you are in a co-dependent relationship. If you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to most of these questions, there is a strong chance that you fall on the wrong side of the fence.According to author and psychologist Shawn Meghan Burn, certain personality traits predispose us to co-dependence. Some of them are:People with a consistent pattern of dysfunctional helping are often strong empathic responders and experience intense feelings and emotional arousal when they perceive that someone is in need. \u201cBecause they feel the other\u2019s pain and want to alleviate it, they impulsively rescue and help. They also have trouble setting boundaries and terminating assistance because they feel badly about the hardship they may cause the other,\u201d says Burn.They can forgive broken promises, underperformance, and accept excuses. Due to their kindness and generosity, they are comfortable with relationships where they give more than they receive.This, in the form of being a worrier with low self-esteem, can lure people into rescuing others from their self-imposed predicaments. \u201cThis happens because they seek to alleviate the distress they experience from others\u2019 predicaments, and because their self-sacrifice makes them feel worthy and valuable, and wins other people\u2019s love and approval, at least in the short run,\u201d says Burn.", "description": "The first step to get out of a co-dependent relationship is to recognise you are in one.
