Republicans were looking for something they could criticize him on that didn\u2019t amount to aiding and abetting impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe widespread criticism from Republicans and some conservative commentators doesn\u2019t automatically mean the president made the wrong call. He ran against endless wars and had obviously grown tired of having U.S. troops stationed in northern Syria. Much of the public may side with him. But in media and political circles the withdrawal is viewed as abandoning our Kurdish allies, who helped turn the tide against ISIS, to a potential massacre by the Turks, who view them as terrorists.\n\nMY HEATED GIULIANI INTERVIEW, AND HIS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BIDEN FAMILY\n\nIt\u2019s Trump\u2019s one-man rule\u2014his own Pentagon was blindsided by the announcement\u2014that sometimes alienates his natural allies.\n\nMost Republicans have stood by the president on Russia, on Ukraine, on impeachment. But the Syria decision drew sharp criticism from Nikki Haley, Marco Rubio, Liz Cheney\u2014even Mitch McConnell.\n\nTrump appeared to backpedal a bit yesterday, saying on Twitter that he\u2019s just shifting 50 troops: \u201cWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.\u201d\n\nThis followed an eye-popping online threat that \u201cif Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)\u201d\n\nRight-leaning journalists have also challenged the president, including Fox\u2019s Kennedy and Brian Kilmeade, and CBN\u2019s Pat Robertson, who said Trump is in danger of losing \u201cthe mandate of heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration is making a serious mistake,\u201d said a National Review editorial, and \u201cTurkey now has an American permission slip to conduct an invasion into Kurdish territory, kill American allies, and carve out a zone of dominance that will further inflame and complicate one of the world\u2019s most dangerous regions.\u201d\n\nNational Review famously published an \u201cAgainst Trump\u201d issue during the campaign with essays from 22 conservatives. Editor Rich Lowry told the New York Times he wished it had never been branded the Never Trump issue. But while NR still publishes some harshly critical pieces, it has moderated its stance toward the president. Lowry \u201cacknowledges that Mr. Trump has helped conservatives like him \u2018stress test your assumptions,\u2019 and has forced him to rethink issues like the need to take a tougher approach with China.\u201d\n\nThe piece also cites conservative blogger and radio host Erick Erickson, who during the campaign called Trump a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cfascist\u201d and said he could not vote for him.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nBut Erickson recently wrote a column headlined \u201cI Support the President,\u201d saying: \u201cIt is not easy to support the president. Many of my friends detest him\u2026I have a hard time cheering. There is much to not like. But there is even more to not like on the left.\u201d\n\nAlso mentioned is the Blaze\u2019s Glenn Beck, who once called Trump \u201can immoral man\u201d and now says his failure to win a second term would mean \u201cthe end of the country as we know it.\u201d\n\nSteve Hayes, the last editor of the Weekly Standard, watched his magazine\u2019s demise as some readers were alienated by its tough coverage of Trump (who cheered its shutdown). Goldberg, a National Review columnist, has also spoken of how his harsh criticism of the president has hurt his career.\n\nNow Jonah and Steve (also a Fox News contributor) are launching the Dispatch, a website, newsletter and podcast that they say will offer \u201cconservative, fact-based news and commentary that doesn\u2019t come either through the filter of the mainstream media or the increasingly boosterish media on the right.\u201d (More on the new venture below.)\n\nThe Times story suggests that some former NeverTrumpers have shifted their stance because it\u2019s more lucrative for them to support and salute the president.\n\nAnd in a telling sentence, the paper says \u201ctheir change in attitude helps to mute the much smaller group of conservative voices who remain highly critical of the president and have questioned his conduct.\u201d\n\nSo: If anti-Trump conservatives are a \u201cmuch smaller group,\u201d how come they dominate at major media outlets? The Times\u2019 own op-ed page, as well as that of the Washington Post, feature conservative columnists who despise Trump. MSNBC has conservative hosts who pound the president day after day. CNN, for various reasons, has dropped several pro-Trump conservative contributors.\n\nCould there be a reason that these news organizations mainly feature conservatives with a harsh view of the Trump presidency?\n\nA New Conservative Voice\n\nThe Dispatch, which goes live Wednesday, is described by Jonah Goldberg as neither \u201cpro-Trump\u201d or \u201canti-Trump,\u201d but \u201cpost-Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s not a lot of reporting on the right,\u201d Goldberg told me in describing the web/newsletter/podcast venture with Steve Hayes. \u201cThey just aim all their fire leftward\u2026A lot of what passes for reporting on the right is really de facto opposition research, going after Democrats.\u201d\n\nGoldberg says they envision their media venture in the mold of the New Republic in the 1980s and \u201990s, a lefty magazine that included such right-leaning voices as Fred Barnes and Charles Krauthammer. \u201cEveryone knew they were liberal, but they weren\u2019t afraid to call BS on Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe founders are gambling on a business model in which the website will carry no ads. Instead, after a period of offering free content, they are hoping to reap revenue from members who sign up because they want conservative reporting and writing that doesn\u2019t necessarily cheerlead for Trump.\n\n\u201cSo much of what\u2019s on the web now, left and right, is geared toward clickbait, making people angry,\u201d Goldberg says, \u201cand we think a lot of people are sick of it.\u201d", "description": "When Lindsey Graham, Donald Trump\u2019s best pal in the Senate, is calling in to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to say that his Syrian withdrawal is \u201cshortsighted and irresponsible,\u201d the president has a problem.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/08/694940094001_6093235505001_6093227753001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
