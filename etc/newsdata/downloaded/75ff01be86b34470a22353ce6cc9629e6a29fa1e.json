(Amy Davis/Baltimore Sun)\n\nTucked between rows of brick homes in Northeast Baltimore, Atiya Wells discovered an extraordinary place.\n\nThe budding naturalist was driving around her neighborhood in February 2018 when she stumbled upon a vacant lot bursting with flora and fauna on Plainfield Avenue in the Frankford neighborhood. Wells spotted a red fox slinking through the unruly tangle of trees, grasses and bushes. She was enchanted.\n\nHer search for the owner of the lot led to a partnership that has resulted in a community farm on the 2\u00bd-acre tract where Wells and a small team of volunteers grow sweet peppers, tomatoes, squash and more. But Wells has a loftier goal \u2014 to transform the property called Bliss Meadows into an educational center that, in part, will teach about the troubled and triumphant agricultural history of African Americans.\n\nThat idea grew out of Wells\u2019s experiences at naturalist conferences and workshops.\n\n\u201cI just realized that there were no black people,\u201d she said.\n\nShe recalled one conference in particular, where the opening exercise invited participants to imagine a tree from their childhood. Although at surface level innocuous, for some folks, including Wells, the exercise brought forth mental images of lynched black bodies hanging from branches.\n\n\n\nFarm manager John Walker examines a pepper. The founders of Bliss Meadows plan to create an educational center and farming space to connect the African American community to the land. (Amy Davis/Baltimore Sun)\n\n\u201cI remember saying to the organizer, \u2018You need to rethink your icebreaker,\u2019 \u201d Wells said. \u201cPrivileged people get to climb trees, other people get to hang from trees.\u201d\n\nThose sorts of memories, known as ancestral trauma, are part of the reason many African Americans don\u2019t interact as much with nature, she said. The outdoors was often the site of horrific abuse and backbreaking work for enslaved Africans, a fact capable of traveling through generations. It has left many black Americans feeling that nature simply isn\u2019t a place meant for them to enjoy, Wells said.\n\nBliss Meadows \u2014 the letters stand for Baltimore Living in Sustainable Simplicity \u2014 got started when Wells tracked down the owner of the spot that she found so captivating.\n\nGreg Cantori, a former director of Maryland Nonprofits, which helps other nonprofit organizations get off the ground, had purchased the fallow farmland with the dream of placing a sustainable, off-the-grid community of tiny homes on the property.\n\nHe had been facing down years of bureaucratic red tape.\n\n\u201cAnd then comes Tia,\u201d he said, calling Wells by her nickname.\n\nShe came to Cantori with her idea for a community farm, and with her educational vision for African Americans in the community. He agreed to let her and her volunteers give it a try.\n\nHe had a few other local urban farmers consider his space, but each had decided they already had enough on their plates with their own farms.\n\n\u201cI really want this to be a part of the community, where you can walk in and take an apple or where you can walk in and take a tomato and cook it,\u201d Cantori said.\n\nBy early April, they had started gardening, clearing a plot of land, planting seeds and surrounding it all with protective deer fencing. And in early May, Wells started a fundraiser to purchase the vacant house next door.\n\nIn about 30 days, Wells and her team raised more than $60,000 through the crowdfunding site GoFundMe. They hope to refurbish the house and use it to teach community members to grow their own food and to cook new dishes.\n\nBliss is in talks with Black Girls Cook, a nonprofit organization focused on teaching life skills through cooking, about lending it a plot on the property for gardening and the house\u2019s kitchen for culinary classes.\n\nBlack Girls Cook recently started an urban farming program, but its garden is separate from the kitchen spaces it has been loaned throughout the city. It often sends the girls who participate in its programming home with produce and recipes, but at Bliss, they could simply walk into the house next door and start cooking.\n\n\u201cIt would be amazing because we would be able to have our entire program in one place,\u201d said Black Girls Cook founder Nichole Mooney.\n\nIn the house, Wells also hopes to teach about the agricultural advances of African Americans, such as George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington, and tell the stories of the Tuskegee Institute and African tribes.\n\nFor community members, especially young people, Wells is hopeful these teachings will answer the question \u201cWhy should I care?\u201d when it comes to farming and the environment.\n\nThese answers are particularly important in Baltimore, she said.\n\n\u201cBaltimore itself has a very racist past,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can talk about environmental education in terms of redlining and blockbusting.\u201d\n\nBliss might even make use of a tiny home as a classroom space to teach these things, making good on Cantori\u2019s original vision for the space.\n\nIn the meantime, Bliss is selling produce from the garden at the monthly market at Lake Montebello and applying for grants to expand efforts on the property.\n\nThat might involve carving out some trails from the tall grasses and brush, but Wells is aiming to keep the wild spirit of the space alive.\n\n\u201cEvery time I come here,\u201d she said, \u201csomething magical happens.\u201d\n\nSometimes it\u2019s a hummingbird, flitting about the flowers, other days it\u2019s monarch butterflies, frogs, turtles or some of the roughly 15 deer that live nearby, by Wells\u2019s count.\n\nThe property backs up against a heavily wooded seven-acre city park \u2014 called Barbara and Parkwood, after the streets near it \u2014 and officials say Bliss has applied to be a volunteer steward of the land.\n\nThe city doesn\u2019t do much of anything in the forested park, said Fran Spero, chief of community engagement for Baltimore City Recreation and Parks, so the group\u2019s interest is great news, she said. It will enter into a partnership with the city to remove some invasive plant species, Spero said, and the city is \u201copen\u201d to discussions about further modifications to the space.\n\nBliss has access to nonprofit fundraising status through a fiscal-sponsorship program run by Strong City Baltimore, a nonprofit organization that extends its tax-exempt status to community groups in exchange for a small chunk of the funds it raises each year, said Tyson Garith, Strong City\u2019s director.\n\n\u201cAtiya had galvanized an incredible amount of community support for this idea,\u201d he said.\n\nAll of this is a somewhat unexpected path for Wells, a pediatric nurse by trade. Wells, now 31, didn\u2019t go on her first hike until she was 22 years old.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up in nature,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of fell into it.\u201d\n\nSo when the New Jersey native discovered the world of edible, medicinal plants, of dandelion fritters and elderberry syrup, she was, in some respects, stunned.\n\n\u201cThis whole world just opened up to me,\u201d she said.", "description": "The founders of Bliss Meadows aim to reconnect the community with nature.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2HI6qa2l1rmDQw_bG5XGcuD89vw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V6OEYOWQXQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
