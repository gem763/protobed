But in the current context, it is important to me, first and foremost, that the energies of the NDP are entirely dedicated to presenting our platform.\"\n\n\"In the coming weeks, months, I will take the necessary steps to clear my reputation of any suspicion.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBC News, his former wife, Rebecca Stuart, alleged he was physically abusive during six years of their seven-year relationship.\n\n\"He slapped, hit me with the back of his hand and split my lip open. I had to go to the ER and have emergency plastic surgery on my lip,\" she told CBC. \"One night, he slapped me across the side of my face, burst my eardrum.\"\n\nShe sent an email outlining the same information to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh on Sept. 10. She did not receive a response.\n\nHer allegations have not been tested in court, but CBC spoke with two of Stuart's friends. One confirmed that he had knowledge of the alleged abuses at the time. The other said she regularly witnessed Stuart with unexplained injuries.\n\nCBC has confirmed the pair were previously married, and divorced in 2015.\n\nInformation sent to party\n\nWhen Stuart saw that he was running for election, she said she had a visceral reaction.\n\n\"It made me feel sick. It made me feel sick to my stomach when I saw it,\" she said.\n\nShe posted the allegations on her own social media, tagging the riding's Facebook page, Jagmeet Singh's Facebook page and the national NDP Facebook page.\n\nShe also posted it directly on the local riding's Facebook page, but claims it was removed. She provided CBC News with a screenshot of the post.\n\nCBC News contacted the NDP to ask about the allegations, and attempted to contact Mathieu directly. Shortly after, the party responded, saying Mathieu had \"decided to step down.\"\n\n\"We learned recently about serious allegations against a candidate. We accept his resignation as it's clear, with these allegations, he could not go on as a candidate for our party,\" the NDP said in a statement.\n\nStuart says she's thankful the response was swift.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm happy it didn't take more than what's happened so far for them to realize that maybe it was a questionable decision,\" Stuart said.", "description": "A Montreal NDP candidate has resigned from his post after he was accused of domestic abuse against his former spouse on social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280412.1568251730!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/olivier-mathieu-and-jagmeet-singh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
