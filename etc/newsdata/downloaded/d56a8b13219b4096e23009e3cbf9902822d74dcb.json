Egypt has pursued a policy of economic austerity in recent years.\n\nPresident Sisi has dismissed the allegations as \"lies and slander\".\n\nWhat's happening in Egypt?\n\n\"Sisi out\" and \"The people want to overthrow the regime\" topped Egyptian Twitter's trending list late on Friday.\n\nHundreds of anti-regime protesters were in and around Tahrir Square despite efforts to disperse them.\n\nEven a few days ago such scenes would have \"unthinkable\", BBC correspondent Sally Nabil tweeted.\n\nDemonstrations were also reported in Egypt's second-largest city Alexandria and in Suez, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nMr Ali, who lives in self-imposed exile in Spain, posted his first video on 2 September. In a video posted on Tuesday, he reportedly said that if President Sisi did not resign by Thursday \"the Egyptian people will come out to the squares on Friday in protest\".\n\nIn 2013, Mr Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, following protests against his rule.\n\nSince then, he has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people.\n\nEgyptians voted to approve constitutional changes in April that could extend Mr Sisi's term in office until 2030, on a turnout of 44%.\n\nHe won 97% of the vote in 2018's presidential election, when he faced no serious opposition.", "description": "The protests are among the first in Egypt since President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi took power in 2014.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1C3D/production/_108892270_tv056660194.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
