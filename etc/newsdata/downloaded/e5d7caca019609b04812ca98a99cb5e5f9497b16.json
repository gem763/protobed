And yet again, the record needs to be corrected.\n\nIn its piece, CNN focuses on two articles that Menashi wrote as a Dartmouth student in the same issue of the Dartmouth Review published on January 15, 2001. The first, \u201cThe Yuck Factor,\u201d was written in Menashi\u2019s capacity as Editor-in-Chief of the Review and cites public polling data about abortion \u2014 including late-term abortion \u2014 and how the polling data contradicts the views of some leading bioethicists on the issue. The second column, \u201cThe College on the Pill,\u201d written under Menashi\u2019s own byline, raised questions about both Dartmouth\u2019s distribution of the Plan B drug and the completeness of the information Dartmouth provided to students about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Yuck Factor\u201d\n\nIn writing about the \u201cBorn-Alive Infants Protection Act,\u201d which had been passed by the House of Representatives the previous fall, Menashi\u2019s editorial observed, \u201cMost people who believe in abortion would tend to draw the line at actual birth.\u201d The editorial continues, \u201cAbortion, of course, is the right to end a pregnancy. Once birth occurs, pregnancy is over: killing the baby after birth is infanticide, not abortion.\u201d Having described public polling on late-term abortion earlier in the editorial, Menashi concluded that there is \u201coverwhelming public consensus against infanticide.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its article published today, CNN wrote: \u201cIn the columns, Menashi focused on extremely rare procedures and even rarer outcomes associated with abortions later in pregnancy.\u201d In support of its claim, CNN cites CDC data seeking to show that late-term abortions are rare:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile induced labor is a form of late-term abortion, abortions after 21 weeks \u2013 including those before the 24-week standard of viability \u2013 account for 1.3% of all abortions in recent CDC data. A CDC study from 2016 shows that between 2003 and 2014, there were 143 recorded fetal and infant deaths associated with induced terminations \u2013 but the study does not indicate how many of the fetuses were viable.\u201d\n\nA few points about this misrepresentation of Menashi by CNN: First, Menashi specifically noted that \u201clive birth abortion\u201d was just \u201cone form of abortion currently practiced\u201d (emphasis added). By no means did Menashi suggest that it was the only or even the most common form of abortion. Second, CNN\u2019s citation of 143 recorded fetal and infant deaths in the cited CDC report lowballs the relevant number. That report actually stated that 588 infant deaths were reported with a code indicating a cause of death to be \u201ctermination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn,\u201d which encompassed both spontaneous and induced abortions. While 143 of that number \u201ccould definitively be classified as involving an induced termination,\u201d the report continued, \u201cit is possible that this number (143) underestimates the total number of deaths involving induced termination\u201d (emphasis added). Third, Menashi was writing about live birth abortion specifically because the recently-passed \u201cBorn-Alive Infants Protection Act\u201d was in the news. That\u2019s exactly what editorials do: comment on items that are currently in the headlines. And finally, taking CNN\u2019s assertion at its face that it is extremely rare for a fetus to survive a dilation and extraction procedure, that does not mean that surviving infants are not worth protecting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile CNN notes Menashi\u2019s reference to South Africa\u2019s issuance of \u201cguidelines in 1997 advising against resuscitation for some infants,\u201d it does not explain how this relates to the title of Menashi\u2019s editorial, \u201cThe Yuck Factor.\u201d In his column, Menashi quoted the South African guidelines, which state: \u201cif an infant is born who gasps for breath, it is advised that the fetus does not receive any resuscitation measures.\u201d Menashi wrote that this is what many bioethicists refer to as \u201cthe yuck factor\u201d \u2014 a delivered baby gasping for breath but being allowed to die. The editorial surveyed the views of bioethicists who maintained that \u201cinfanticide was not only morally permissible, but often imperative\u201d (emphasis added). But CNN conveniently omitted this tidbit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe College on the Pill\u201d\n\nIn his column, Menashi wrote about how, for a period of time, the Dartmouth administration had been training undergraduates to advise residents \u201cwho were at risk for pregnancy\u201d to use the Plan B drug, and that even some resident advisors had kept a \u201csupply of Plan B\u201d in their rooms to give to students (despite the fact that Plan B required a prescription at the time). (Menashi noted that, eventually, administration officials \u201capparently realized the legal problem with students distributing Plan B\u201d).\n\nMenashi also detailed the \u201crelatively simple\u201d process by which students were able to (legally) obtain a Plan B prescription, by having a five-minute consultation with a Dartmouth health department official. Having sent a Dartmouth Review staff member for such a consultation, Menashi reported about the potential misinformation that the health department was conveying to students. Menashi wrote that the health department official explained that Plan B was different from an abortion (\u201cit\u2019s a hormone to try to stop you from ovulating . . . . It\u2019s not an abortion pill.\u201d). While Menashi wrote that the health department employee correctly described the Plan B drug as \u201cinhibiting or delaying\u201d ovulation, he noted that there \u201cwas a third case\u201d not mentioned by the advising health official, \u201cin which the emergency contraceptive prevents an already fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCNN incorrectly suggests this to be Menashi\u2019s personal view. Instead, Menashi continues on to state the viewpoint of the Family Research Council (shared by many Catholics), which was that pregnancy occurs at fertilization \u2014 not implantation. Menashi directly quoted the then-spokeswoman of the Family Research Council, who said, \u201cThere is a case where a pregnancy has not occurred and the morning-after pill would decrease the uterine lining so that there is nowhere for the fertilized egg to implant itself, so it dies.\u201d\n\nRather than promoting any particular viewpoint about Plan B, Menashi was highlighting the fact that one\u2019s moral view of when a pregnancy begins necessarily affects one\u2019s view of whether the drug functions as an abortifacient. Menashi specifically wrote: \u201cThe dispute isn\u2019t the result of deliberate misinformation, of course, but a conflict over definition.\u201d (For this reason, CNN\u2019s sub-heading in the piece \u201cMenashi called the morning after pill an \u2018abortifacient'\u201d is misleading, because he was reporting the viewpoint of groups that took that position.) Menashi very accurately wrote, \u201cHealth Services is misleading those students who believe that life begins at conception \u2014 pushing them toward a choice they might abhor if they had complete information.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this newest smear, CNN attempts to paint Menashi as someone who holds extremist views about abortion and contraception. But this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Menashi was pushing back against out-of-touch bioethicists who made shocking statements about infanticide, and showing how their views were out of the mainstream. He was demonstrating sensitivity to those who had moral or religious objections to the morning-after pill and helping to ensure that those viewpoints were heard and understood. Ironically, Menashi\u2019s columns as an aspiring young journalist achieved exactly what CNN fails to do today with this article: ensure that every side of the story is fairly told.", "description": "Yet again, CNN\u2019s K-File has misrepresented and distorted Second Circuit nominee Steven Menashi\u2019s college writings\u2014this time about abortion and contraception.", "authors": ["Carrie Severino", "Andrew C.
