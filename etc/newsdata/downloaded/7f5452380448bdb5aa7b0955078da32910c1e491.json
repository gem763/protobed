It doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nInstead he flies by the seat of his pants. When an idea fails, he tries another one. Then another one, And another one after that.\n\nShamelessness is his simple sword of lies and trusty shield of deception.\n\nRemember that Johnson didn\u2019t even believe in the UK leaving the EU until he saw it as the key to No 10.\n\nYet there\u2019s no dodging the blow to Johnson\u2019s authority when the PM\u2019s legally required to seek an extension of Britain\u2019s membership of the European club.\n\nHe won\u2019t do so will Johnson die in a ditch? Not yet is the disappointing answer for those fighting to save Britain in Europe.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe solemn promise was just another piece of discardable propaganda for Downing Street\u2019s fibber-in-chief.\n\nIn fairness to Johnson, it\u2019s possible he could still secure approval for his horror plan to impoverish and destablise this land before Halloween.\n\nTricky with the clock tickng though possible. Key is persuading betrayed DUP allies to swallow their mortification. The taxpayers\u2019 cheque would require a lot of zeros.\n\nTUC chief Frances O\u2019Grady skilfully highlighting the latest Brexit fraud\u2019s danger to job rights put backbones into Labour waverers toying with supporting Johnson.\n\nNo-deal\u2019s worse than Johnson\u2019s bad deal which in turn is inferior to May\u2019s thrice rejected compromise.\n\nMiscalculating we\u2019d be in a General Election now, miscalculating Parliament could be sidelines and miscalculating a Saturday showcase would give him a kiss of approval is a leaden PM lacking the winning touch.\n\nAll that could change next week or the week after but for the moment it\u2019s another humiliation for a human rubber ball in danger of losing his bounce.\n\nSouthampton headed football\u2019s premier First Division, the Goombay Dance Bank topped the singles chart and the price of a pint was 62p when MPs gathered for the last Saturday debate, on the Falklands, way back in April 1982.\n\nJohnson must wish he\u2019d stayed home and watched England thump Australia in the rugby world cup.\n\nThey\u2019re laughing at him, not with, now.", "description": "One Tory Minister, a Brexit true believeer, whispered the Prime Minister has no masterplan", "authors": ["Kevin Maguire", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20652484.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Britains-Prime-Minister-Boris-Johnson-leaves-Downing-Street-to-head-for-the-House-of-Commons-as-par.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
