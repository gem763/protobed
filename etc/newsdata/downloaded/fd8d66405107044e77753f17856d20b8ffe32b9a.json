Mid October and the water is still warm to swim in. The doggos are loving it here and so am I.'\n\nOthers adventurers have given their rusty old vans a revamp by adding the likes of a stove to keep warm, a carpeted living area and a dining table.\n\nAs many as 16 businesses offer families and adventurers the chance to covert white vans into dream homes on wheels, according to campervan website Quirky Campers.\n\nLucy and Ben, from Cornwall, added cupboards to their stunning converted rusty LDV Convoy - and a stove to keep warm\n\nThe trend is catching on in the UK, with the DVLA reporting that there has been a two thirds rise in the number of people applying for 'live in' licences for their vans over the last two years. Sarah McWilliams, from the UK (pictured), is about to convert her old white van\n\nThere are a wide range of services available - varying from a whole or part conversion, quirkification or consultancy.\n\nHowever, it seems many UK van-owners prefer to do it themselves, with Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube awash with tips on how to covert your vehicle.\n\nAnother image, shared by a UK-based lady who goes by the Instagram handle sarahmcw, shows her hanging out the door of a transit van.\n\n'If you're interested or just want a laugh (we've never converted anything)', she wrote. 'You can follow us for all the conversion spam.'\n\nThe popular craze also seems to have taken off in the US, with young adults and couples alike uploading snaps of their campervan lives.\n\nMeanwhile, a large number of explorers are also choosing to permanently reside in the converted vans, enabling them to make an impressive saving on rent while also having the freedom to travel.\n\nTanja (pictured) and Lenny have been travelling around Edinburgh in Scotland in their a converted van.
