Under Poland\u2019s complex electoral rules, the wider victory did not translate into any gains in the legislature.\n\nThe main opposition grouping, the Civic Coalition, an umbrella organisation that includes the Civic Platform (PO) formerly led by EU Council President Donald Tusk, secured 134 seats in parliament, with 27.4% of votes.\n\nFour years of PiS rule have shifted the political climate in Poland, dividing the country over issues such as gay rights and media freedom, with critics saying PiS has fomented homophobia and turned public broadcasters into a mouthpiece for its agenda.\n\nTapping in to widespread dissatisfaction with economic prosperity among many Poles since the collapse of communism, PiS told voters it will aim to replace the business and cultural elites to ensure fair distribution of the nation\u2019s wealth.\n\nUnderlying divisions, election turnout at 61.7% was the highest in any parliamentary vote since a 1989 vote that ushered in the end of communism.\n\n\u201cThere is a shift in the people\u2019s consciousness, which moves in the direction of blocking PiS\u2019s authoritarian tendencies,\u201d Izabela Leszczyna, a PO lawmaker who kept her mandate, told Reuters.\n\nPoland's ruling party Law and Justice (PiS) leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski speaks after the exit poll results are announced in Warsaw, Poland, October 13, 2019.

It is time to complete decommunisation. It is time to stop the LGBT dictate!\u201d Deputy Digitalisation Minister Andrzej Andruszkiewicz, who is seen as close to far-right politicians, wrote in a tweet.\n\nPiS had campaigned on a promise to enshrine more Catholic and patriotic values in public life, branding lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights an \u201cinvasive foreign influence\u201d that threatens Poland\u2019s national identity.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nThe election also resulted in the return of Janusz Korwin-Mikke, 76, a firebrand right-wing politician, to parliament.\n\nKorwin-Mikke attracted international media attention in 2017 when he said in a European Parliament debate that women should earn less than men \u201cbecause they are weaker, they are smaller, they are less intelligent.\u201d\n\nEU leaders congratulated PiS on its election victory, though Brussels has taken Poland to court over the party\u2019s previous judicial reforms and has criticised some of its other policies.", "description": "Poland's nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party narrowly won a second term in power, final results from Sunday's parliamentary election showed, but its drive to push through its conservative agenda may be hampered by a loss of the upper house.", "authors": ["Pawel Florkiewicz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440634975&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0JB", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
