Al Green (D-Texas) on Tuesday delivered a searing condemnation of President Donald Trump\u2019s comparison of constitutional impeachment proceedings to lynching, equating the commander in chief to a member of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\n\u201cHow dare he do this!\u201d Green told colleagues during a floor speech. \u201cDoes he not know the history of lynching in this country? Does he not know that thousands of African Americans were lynched, mob violence? Does he not know this is the equivalent of murder?\u201d\n\nThat morning, Trump suggested in a tweet that House Democrats are engaging in their inquiry \u201cwithout due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d adding that Republicans are bearing witness to \u201ca lynching,\u201d an act of terror used by whites against thousands of Blacks throughout the Jim Crow-era South.\n\nGreen questioned whether the president even grasped the gravity of his statement, invoking the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, during which counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed by a neo-Nazi. In the wake of the violence, Trump infamously claimed that \u201cboth sides\u201d were at fault.\n\n\u201cIf you continue to weaponize racism and bigotry, this makes you no better than those who were screaming \u2018blood and soil,\u2019 \u2018Jews will not replace us,\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cIt makes you no better than those who burn crosses. It makes you no better than those who wear hoods and white robes.\u201d\n\nA growing list of lawmakers have now spoken out against Trump\u2019s remarks, including House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.), who sits on the Congressional Black Caucus with Green and is the top-ranking Black member of Congress.\n\n\u201cThat is one word no president ought to apply to himself,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m a product of the South. I know the history of that word. That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.\u201d\n\nHowever, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley has defended Trump\u2019s language, claiming that he was \u201cnot comparing what\u2019s happened to him with one of our darkest moments in American history,\u201d though his tweet did just that.\n\n\u201cI understand that there are many people in the media who don\u2019t agree with his language,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cHe has used many words to describe the way he\u2019s been relentlessly attacked.\u201d", "description": "The House Democrat delivered a scathing rebuke of the president's claim that impeachment proceedings are tantamount to a lynching.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daf3410210000ba1e34ab91.jpeg?cache=crlxltg8pe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
