Some of my friends go to school by MTR and it has affected them,\u201d said Teresa Kwok, 14, of South Island School.\n\n\u201cProtesters are getting out of control and they are just releasing their anger by attacking the rail system because they will get a lot of attention from other Hong Kong citizens.\n\nHong Kong protests: Apple under fire from China for listing app that tracks police activity in HK\n\n\u201cI understand the protesters are not satisfied with what the government did before but affecting the railway system inconveniences a lot of people who want to go to work or school.\u201d\n\nA student from a school in Sai Ying Pun who didn\u2019t want to be named said, \u201cI am severely affected by the delays and shutdowns. For example, I go to Wan Chai and Causeway Bay for tutorials on weekends.\n\n\u201cAll of my classes [and other activities] were cancelled, because I couldn\u2019t get anywhere without the MTR [and with the tram services cancelled on Sunday]. This sucks, especially since I\u2019ll sit the HKDSE next year.\n\nHong Kong protests: What are the 'five demands'? What do protesters want?\n\n\u201cAlso, tutorials usually end at night [around 8pm] but with reduced MTR services, they have to cut short the classes. I really don\u2019t want to blame anybody, but the MTR services are essential to people like me, who have to travel around on a tight schedule.\u201d\n\nThe MTR Corporation could not say last night when the worst-affected stations were likely to reopen, as it scrambled to return services to normal after hard-core protesters went on the rampage from Friday in response to the government\u2019s anti-mask law.\n\nThe embattled rail giant announced the whole system would close early again at 8pm yesterday to allow for repairs, as passengers entered the sixth straight day of MTR disruption.\n\nThe MTR Corp said the number of damaged facilities had increased significantly since last Friday.", "description": "Train services will shut down at 8pm again to allow more time for repairs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/faa88c70-ea66-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4imagehires182245.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
