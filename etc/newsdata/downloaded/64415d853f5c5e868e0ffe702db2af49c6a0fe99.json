He had a closely contested battle at UFC 213 in 2017, then a proverbial war at UFC 225, where Romero was able to drop and badly hurt Whittaker on numerous occasions, but once again left his fate in the hands of the judges and lost a controversial split decision.\n\nAnd Masvidal thinks Adesanya is fortunate to not have fought Romero, instead.\n\n\u201cI told everyone that no one is the same after fighting @YoelRomeroMMA you guys will see. Ufc smart for protecting Israel. Yoel wins one and should be next. Should\u2019ve been the one from the get #theresurrection\u201d\n\nI told everyone that no one is the same after fighting @YoelRomeroMMA you guys will see. Ufc smart for protecting Israel.

If anyone can relate to Romero, it\u2019s Masvidal, who\u2019s had numerous split decision losses himself.\n\nStill considered one of the biggest threats in the division, Romero may need a couple more wins before he gets another crack at the title, and his manager thinks a fight with the winner of Kelvin Gastelum and Darren Till, who are scheduled to fight at UFC 244, is a logical next move.\n\n\u201cAnyone else want @killagorillamma vs Whittaker? I\u2019m so down for that one. Maybe @YoelRomeroMMA vs the winner of gas and till?\u201d\n\nAnyone else want @killagorillamma vs Whittaker? I\u2019m so down for that one.
