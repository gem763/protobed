That has helped P&G to drive success with new product introductions, notably within the Crest toothpaste and Tide laundry detergent brands. The company officially reorganized its business on July 1, and Moeller says less duplication among teams is leading to better product execution.\n\nAll of that showed up in P&G\u2019s first fiscal quarter.\n\nP&G grew organic sales in all of its business lines in the quarter, paced by a 10% gain in beauty. Product volume increased in all segments except grooming, which fell 1%, as P&G continues to feel pressure from competitive pricing by upstart razor blade companies.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
