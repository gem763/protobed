The move quickly drew fire from ethics experts and political rivals.\n\nThe House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called Trump\u2019s properties a \u201ccesspool of corruption\u201d and accused the president of \u201cprioritizing his profits over the interests of the American people\u201d.\n\n\u201cPence is just the latest Republican elected official to enable President Trump\u2019s violations of the constitution,\u201d she said.\n\nA spokesman for the vice-president said the decision was partly based on the president\u2019s suggestion Pence stay there, and partly on secret service concerns about costs and logistics. Questioned about the decision on Wednesday, Trump claimed he had \u201cno involvement, other than it\u2019s a great place\u201d.\n\nBut that was only the start of the controversy.\n\nRelated: Mike Pence backs Boris Johnson over Brexit in awkward Dublin visit\n\nThe Irish Times columnist Miriam Lord responded to a tense meeting between the vice-president and the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in which Pence urged the republic to protect the \u201cUnited Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty\u201d. That Varadkar is gay and Pence a past champion of anti-LGBTQ legislation in Indiana also caused widespread comment.\n\nPence laid on platitudes about being \u201cdeeply humbled\u201d and \u201chonoured\u201d to be visiting Doonbeg, the home of his mother\u2019s grandmother. But in Dublin he offered his hosts a clear lesson in his administration\u2019s political priorities.\n\nPence told Varadkar in a prepared statement: \u201cAs the deadline for Brexit approaches, we urge Ireland and the European Union, as well, to negotiate in good faith with Prime Minister Johnson, and work to reach an agreement that respects the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty and minimizes the disruption to commerce.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cLet me be clear: the US supports the UK decision to leave the EU in Brexit. But we also recognise the unique challenges on your northern border. And I can assure you we will continue to encourage the United Kingdom and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit respects the Good Friday agreement.\u201d\n\nAmong media responses, Irish Central asked: \u201cDid VP Pence betray Ireland in his Brexit comments during Irish trip?\u201d\n\nThe Irish Examiner accused Pence of trying to \u201chumiliate\u201d the republic.\n\nBut Lord struck the most telling blow.\n\nShe described the impact of the Pence visit on Ireland as \u201clike pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling,\u201d she added, \u201cit was clear he was channeling His Master\u2019s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.\u201d\n\n\u201cPence,\u201d Lord continued, \u201cis Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the \u2018Old Country\u2019 as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d\n\nLord wasn\u2019t alone in her criticism. The Examiner\u2019s political editor, Daniel McConnell, wrote: \u201cThe cheek of him coming here, eating our food, clogging up our roads and then having the nerve to humiliate his hosts.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 6 September 2019 in line with Guardian style guidance.", "description": "The vice-president\u2019s comments on Brexit while visiting Ireland and his stay at his boss\u2019s golf course did not go down wellVice-President Mike Pence arrives in Doonbeg to dine with relatives at a seafood restaurant.
