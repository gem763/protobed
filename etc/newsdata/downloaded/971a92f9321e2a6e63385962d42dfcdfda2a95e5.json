His problem was no longer how to put his affairs in order. It was what to do with the rest of his life.\n\nNearly a quarter of a century later, Mend\u00e3o, 61, is one of an increasing number of people who face a challenge that once would have seemed an unthinkable luxury: growing old with HIV.\n\n\u201cHIV disease nowadays is a disease of inflammation\" \u2014 Eug\u00e9nio Te\u00f3filo, consultant at Hospital Dos Capuchos in Lisbon\n\nIn Portugal alone, some 35,000 people are on life-saving antiretroviral medication \u2014 up from 5,000 when Mend\u00e3o first started treatment. Of the nearly 37 million people infected with HIV worldwide, about one in six have already celebrated their 50th birthday.\n\nThis change in the nature of the epidemic \u2014 from a death sentence to a disease that must be managed into old age \u2014 poses a new challenge in the battle against it. For the vast majority infected with HIV, the problem is no longer about how to keep from dying, it's about how to cope with a virus that that they will likely have to manage for the rest of their lives.\n\nAging with the virus\n\nMend\u00e3o touches his chest and then his stomach. His was one of the first reported cases of fat accumulation caused by early antiretroviral treatments in Portugal. The three-drug combination that saved his life also hollowed out his cheek bones and swelled his belly.\n\n\u201cIt had all the adverse events that you can imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was also efficient in stopping the replication of the virus, so it was very efficient in keeping me alive.\u201d\n\nResearchers and health care systems around the world are just beginning to understand what it means to grow old with HIV, as the first cohort of people infected in their youth enter the later stages of their lives.\n\nComplications can arise from the effects of the virus and from the medication used to keep it in check, says Eug\u00e9nio Te\u00f3filo, a consultant in internal medicine at the Hospital Dos Capuchos in Lisbon.\n\n\u201cHIV disease nowadays is a disease of inflammation,\u201d he says. Even when antiretroviral drugs have knocked the virus down to undetectable levels, the body remains under a low-level state of stress.\n\nThe inflammation causes problems in people\u2019s cardiovascular system. \u201cWe have more dyslipidemia \u2014 increased levels of fat in the blood \u2014 in persons with HIV and we have an increased risk of heart problems and even stroke,\u201d he says.\n\nThen there are the long-term side effects of HIV medication. Crixivan, a drug used in the early days of AIDS treatment, gave people huge bellies and humps on the back of their necks. A protein inhibitor, the drug had \u201chuge metabolic impacts,\u201d increasing the cholesterol level in the blood, which could lead to heart attacks, Te\u00f3filo says. It was also found to accumulate in the kidney. Another drug, d4T, had the side effect of draining fat from patients\u2019 faces.\n\nEven some of the antiretroviral drugs used to control HIV today can have negative side effects on people\u2019s bones, kidneys and livers, while others interact with drugs people usually take when they get older, such as statins to control cholesterol levels, antidepressants and cardiovascular medicines, according to a report by the European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG), an advocacy group.\n\n\u201cThe perception that the general population has of HIV is more or less the same as 20 years ago\" \u2014 Giulio Maria Corbelli, a member of the European AIDS Treatment Group\n\nMany of those living with HIV were not prepared to get old, so in many cases they live more isolated lives, given that they have a disease that was and remains highly stigmatized, says Giulio Maria Corbelli, a member of EATG who was diagnosed with HIV in 1997 and was recently involved in research on aging with HIV.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe perception that the general population has of HIV is more or less the same as 20 years ago,\u201d he says.\n\nFor his part, Mend\u00e3o is convinced the virus \u2014 and the drugs he has taken to fight it \u2014 have caused him to age faster. \u201cI have the heart and spine and other things that are more common in people that are 80 than 60,\u201d he says.\n\nThere is one good side of getting old with HIV, he adds. He goes to the doctor more often to get checked, so other diseases are diagnosed early.\n\nDeath's door\n\nIt was a young doctor who haltingly delivered the news of his HIV diagnosis to Mend\u00e3o. \u201cAt the time, it was the youngest one who was sent as punishment to communicate the results to patients, because it was a death sentence,\u201d Mend\u00e3o recalls.\n\nMend\u00e3o had studied biochemistry in France at university, lived briefly in Italy, then returned to Lisbon to run a nightclub with his cousin.\n\nHe had used heroin and cocaine when he was young and had, he says, loved both men and women. He liked his male partners younger and his women lovers older, he says with a smile. In retrospect, he thinks he was infected in 1986, during a one-night stand with a man he didn\u2019t know.\n\nBy 1996, he had been feeling bad for a couple of years. He shuttled from doctor to doctor, and was told he was depressed. It never crossed his mind that he could be infected with HIV.\n\nBy September of that year, when his diagnosis came, he was almost in the terminal stage. \u201cMy immune system had collapsed,\u201d he says. One of the markers of AIDS is the level of white blood cells that fight infections known as CD4s. Healthy people have between 500 to 1,500 cells per microliter of blood. The commonly accepted threshold for AIDS is 200. Mend\u00e3o had just two.\n\nAt the time, someone in the throes of AIDS could expect to live two to three years, Mend\u00e3o says. So he figured he had less than a year to live. His first thought was that he\u2019d have to find a way to settle his debts; his restaurant business was not going well.\n\nThen he asked for his notebook and for coins to use the hospital payphone to warn his eight most recent sexual partners \u2014 four men and four women \u2014 that they could have been infected too. (Their results all came back negative.)\n\nNew life\n\nThe first months with AIDS were the hardest. His compromised immune system left him vulnerable to pneumonia, skin infections and \u201cworst of all,\u201d an infection that nearly blinded him in his right eye.\n\n\u201cThat only happens when AIDS reaches [its] final course,\u201d he says. Treating the eye condition required him to come to the hospital every day, and there was no guarantee it would prevent blindness.\n\n\n\nHe devised a suicide plan to engineer a car crash that looked like an accident so that his loved ones could cash in on his life insurance. He even picked out the place he would do it.\n\nHe started taking antiretroviral medication in order to buy himself enough time to settle his accounts, visiting one of Portugal\u2019s most respected HIV specialists, Kamal Mansinho. It was an intensive treatment: Mend\u00e3o took his first pills at 4 a.m. and every two hours until midnight, and followed a strict diet.\n\nFully expecting to be dead before the end of 1997, he was shocked when Mansinho told him he was \u201cnot dying now.\u201d\n\nFor Mend\u00e3o, that wasn\u2019t entirely good news. He had resolved his debts but had no money and no career. He was still sick and half blind, and wondered if he would have enough energy to start something up again.\n\nIt was somebody else\u2019s attempt to end her life that turned things around. After the younger sister of a former girlfriend attempted suicide, he invited her to stay with him in Portugal. Soon after they were hiking the 1,000-kilometer Camino de Santiago, a network of old pilgrim routes ending in Spain.\n\nIt was a transformative journey. He couldn\u2019t believe what he saw in the mirror when he went to take a shower in his hotel in Santiago, at the end of the hike. \u201cNo belly, all muscles. I was never like this in my all life,\u201d he remembers thinking.\n\nHe dropped his plans for suicide. \u201cI loved it, and I became more physically fit than ever,\u201d he says. Soon after, he married his walking companion.\n\nChanges in treatment\n\nThe transformative effects of antiretroviral drugs has changed the way HIV need to be tackled, says Te\u00f3filo, the consultant in internal medicine at the Hospital Dos Capuchos. \u201cNowadays I hardly think about HIV.\u201d Nearly all his patients have suppressed the virus with antiretroviral drugs.\n\nNow he\u2019s concerned with monitoring the side effects from the treatment. Modern antiretrovirals no longer have the dramatic effects they did on Mend\u00e3o, but they can still cause serious health problems in some patients.\n\nTe\u00f3filo also focuses on prevention of other diseases in his patients \u2014 something he admits is a new thing for doctors like him, trained to treat diseases rather than preventing them.\n\n\u201cYou have to give up on too many things: your image, after a certain time your sexuality, your wellbeing, and you feel always tired, you feel always pain\" \u2014 Lu\u00eds Mend\u00e3o\n\nIf side effects are serious, patients might decide to stop taking the medicines, which is one of his big concerns, Te\u00f3filo says.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about medication for patients, [I wonder] how I can fit that medication in their lifestyle, because it\u2019s hard to have someone change their lifestyle so they can take the medication,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed over the past decades is fear of HIV, according to Te\u00f3filo. People come asking for PrEP drugs, medicines to prevent them from getting the disease.\n\nTalking with patients, he realized that anxiety is a big motivator, and many aren\u2019t doing well psychologically. \u201cIf we try to improve their psychological health, they might not even need PrEP any longer,\u201d he says.\n\nBiggest regret\n\nFor Mend\u00e3o, HIV has become just one of his health concerns. Antiretroviral treatments have improved greatly in the two decades since his diagnosis. To keep the virus in check these days, he takes two pills in the morning and one at night. He also takes 10 other pills for other conditions, such as diabetes and asthma.\n\nLiving with HIV remains a big challenge, he says. \u201cYou have to give up on too many things: your image, after a certain time your sexuality, your wellbeing, and you feel always tired, you feel always pain.\u201d\n\nHe has built a second career as an activist and now runs Portugal\u2019s Treatment Action Group, a 65-people NGO that advocates for access to treatment for HIV and other diseases and offers testing services in the Lisbon area. In 2015, he received a medal from the Portuguese president for helping the country negotiate a lower price for the first hepatitis C drug that could cure the disease. He was also one of the beneficiaries of this new class of hepatitis C drugs. After a different treatment in 2003 wreaked \u201chorrendous side effects\u201d and nearly killed him, one of the new drugs cured him of the disease in 2015.\n\nMend\u00e3o says he gave up on sex after he divorced his wife in 2005. With drugs and alcohol also behind him, he has one vice left: smoking. \u201cOtherwise, I would be a saint,\u201d he says. He sometimes jokes with a colleague in a similar situation that they\u2019re immortal. \u201cWe are growing old, but we\u2019re condemned to eternal life,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nIf there was one thing he would change about his life with the virus, it would be the fact that he never had children. \u201cThough I got married when I was 41, I decided that my life expectancy, the burden of disease, was not a good environment for kids,\u201d he says. \u201cToday I regret [this]. This would have been a big difference in my life.\u201d\n\nThis article is produced with full editorial independence by POLITICO reporters and editors.
