People who went through the same things, years apart, share their stories\n\n\u2018The biggest achievement of the anti-abortion lobby is making women feel guilty\u2019\n\n\n\nSam, 26, and Diane Munday, 88, had abortions five decades apart\n\nSam and Diane are sitting in Diane\u2019s front room in Hertfordshire, hands warmed by mugs of coffee, chatting as if they are old friends. In fact, they have just met, brought together by their similar personal and political experiences, which took place some 50 years apart.\n\n\u201cBack in the 1960s, nobody talked about abortion. It was a word that was never said, never written,\u201d says Diane. When her dressmaker and friend, married with three young children, died from a backstreet abortion, \u201cit knocked me between the eyes,\u201d she says. She thought of her again when, married with three children herself, she became pregnant at 29: \u201cI knew the minute that pregnancy was confirmed that I wasn\u2019t going to continue with it. I had reached my limit in my circumstances.\u201d\n\nHer choice, in 1961, was between an illegal abortion, and paying a doctor to say that a legal termination was necessary for health reasons; she opted for the latter. Diane\u2019s abortion took place on Harley Street in London. \u201cOddly, I came round from the anaesthetic remembering the young woman who died. She was dead and I was alive because my husband and I, borrowing from my mother, could afford an abortion. I said to myself: \u2018I will fight for other women to have the privilege of being able to control their own fertility.\u2019\u201d Diane went on to play a key role in helping to change the law: \u201cAnd here you see me, aged 88, still fighting.\u201d\n\nShe turns to Sam: \u201cSo tell me about your experience.\u201d Sam explains, that after she suffered terrible side-effects from hormonal contraception she and her then-boyfriend tried natural family planning, which failed. \u201cThe first time I was pregnant, two years ago, I was terrified. I didn\u2019t have a stable relationship, a good job, a proper home I could raise a child in. I was too young.\u201d Diane responds, softly: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right for you.\u201d\n\nThanks to campaigners such as Diane, who fought for the Abortion Act 1967, Sam had a legal termination at a Marie Stopes clinic. \u201cI decided to have a surgical abortion under general anaesthetic because I was so afraid, but it was fine,\u201d she says. \u201cThe only time I really felt scared was going through to the operating theatre. I started to cry, and asked someone to hold my hand. Then I was out.\n\nThe first public meeting I spoke at in the 60s, I went in trembling. They were respectable ladies in hats and gloves\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of silence. I found the silence so suffocating, I decided to talk about it on Twitter. I was scared of anti-choicers harassing me, but within a few hours at least 40 people had messaged me, giving their support. It was mostly women who\u2019d had abortions, saying they had never spoken about this before, that their family didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSam is shocked to hear that Diane had a similar experience, half a century earlier. She joined the Abortion Law Reform Association (now Abortion Rights), in 1962: \u201cThe first public meeting I spoke at, I went in trembling. They were respectable ladies wearing hats and gloves. I stood up and said, \u2018I have had an abortion.\u2019 During the tea interval these ladies came up to me, one after another, saying, \u2018You know dear, I had an abortion back in the 30s, I\u2019ve never told anybody before.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d\n\nDespite Sam\u2019s openness, she still felt a sense of shame when she needed a second abortion after emergency contraception failed; by now, she says, \u201cI knew the relationship was not one that I could have a child within.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, you made a responsible decision,\u201d Diane reassures her. \u201cI really think it\u2019s the biggest achievement of the anti-abortion lobby: making women feel guilty.\u201d\n\nDiane drank only half a glass of champagne when abortion was partially legalised in 1967, and is still waiting to drink another half glass: she says she will not rest until it is legal for everyone. Sam, who campaigns for Marie Stopes, agrees: \u201cThe only thing left now is for abortion to be taken out of criminal law and be treated as a healthcare issue across the UK, including Northern Ireland. It\u2019s for us to continue the work. I\u2019m so grateful that you all fought so hard for us to have those rights,\u201d she tells Diane.\n\nDiane smiles. \u201cThat makes me feel very happy. There are only a couple of us early pioneers left now \u2013 you\u2019ve got to carry that fight on for other women.\u201d\n\nSam has tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cDo you want another coffee?\u201d asks Diane, gently.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re hearing the exact same slurs and experiences as we did 40 years ago\u2019\n\nRoxy Legane, 28, and Nona Ferdon, 91, civil rights activists\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018In the UK, we\u2019re good at covering up our racism\u2019: Roxy Legane and Nona Ferdon. Photograph: Kensington Leverne/The Guardian\n\nMidway through their conversation, Nona Ferdon proudly shows Roxy Legane photographs of her standing with Martin Luther King Jr, pictures that were taken on a march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. Nona explains how, as a clinical psychologist working in Hawaii, she was part of a medical unit that joined the civil rights demonstration.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere was very tense,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo weeks before, people had been stampeded with horses and policemen. We gathered around at a chapel, and it was the first time I heard We Shall Overcome. The second verse was: \u2018Black and white together, we shall overcome.\u2019 That was very much the feeling.\u201d Her eyes brighten as she talks.\n\nFive decades later, Roxy is battling racism \u2013 and, as a woman of colour, experiencing it. She works with anti-racist groups and runs the community project Kids of Colour in Manchester. Her own memories of racism go back to childhood. \u201cMy dad wasn\u2019t welcome at my mum\u2019s parents\u2019 house. He was from Mauritius, and they were white, and thought he couldn\u2019t provide what they wanted for her, and for me there was racism wrapped up in that. [Also] growing up in a predominantly white environment, being around lots of micro-aggressions.\u201d She tells Nona that progress feels slow. \u201cLast year I put on an event about racism in education, and a 13-year-old talked about his experiences of violence and restraint at school. Older people in the room were saying, \u2018We\u2019re hearing the same slurs and experiences that we heard 40 years ago.\u2019 That is shocking and frustrating.\u201d She describes being contacted by a mother whose seven-year-old, a mixed-race child, was spat at by a white child of the same age, and told she could not play with white children; and meeting young people of colour who, flattened by the oppression they face, say, \u201cI just want to be white.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve got to have someone you can sit down with and say, \u2018My God, you won\u2019t believe what he said to me\u2026'\n\nNona agrees that progress is slow. But, she says, \u201cThere have been tremendous changes in the US. I remember the day the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, people of colour circled around, block after block, trying to vote.\u201d Before this, they had been prevented from voting because they had failed impossible, deliberately obtuse literacy tests that included questions such as, How many bubbles in a bar of soap?, she explains. While Nona still feels the outlook is bleak, with Trump in the White House, she tells Roxy: \u201cPlease believe me, there have been such massive changes. If you could put your mind back into 1950 \u2013 it was a different world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel aware of how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d Roxy says. \u201cBut similarly aware of how much there is to be done. In the UK, we\u2019re good at covering up our racism \u2013 but it can be seen in who is most likely to have poor housing, or be in the prison system, or unemployed, and that comes back to people of colour. We look at the US and think: how can they do that to migrant children? But we split up and destroy families here, too.\u201d\n\nWhen Roxy talks of how drained and helpless she can feel, Nona encourages her to talk, to take care of herself. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have someone you can sit down with and say, \u2018My God, you won\u2019t believe what he said to me\u2026\u2019\u201d She adds, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to teach my grandchildren this: every day you live is a footstep in tomorrow, and a brick in the person you want to be.\u201d\n\nOnce the conversation has drawn to a close, Nona\u2019s daughter takes us to visit the 10 leonberger puppies they have bred. \u201cNow this is what I call self-care,\u201d says Roxy, as she holds one close.\n\n\u2018I was 19 and I\u2019d drive to work crying my eyes out\u2019\n\n\n\nAlex Evans, 45, and Paul McGregor, 29, lost their fathers to suicide, 18 years apart\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There was definitely a stigma\u2019: Alex Evans and Paul McGregor. Photograph: Kensington Leverne/The Guardian\n\nWhen commercial manager Alex Evans, 45, meets entrepreneur Paul McGregor, 29, at the Guardian\u2019s offices, it looks from the outside like an ordinary business meeting, all handshakes and nice-to-meet-yous. But in the room there is a tension, as if we are all holding our breath.\n\nPaul, his voice steady, goes first. \u201cMy life was straightforward until I was about 18. I grew up in Essex with my parents and older brother. I was quite academic at school, played a lot of football. My mum and dad were childhood sweethearts. On the outside it looked like a happy family. But when I was 18, my dad just broke. His eyes were distant, he was saying things \u2013 we didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d After taking antidepressants and being admitted to a psychiatric hospital, he killed himself on 4 March 2009, at the age of 45.\n\nPaul now tells his story at events to raise awareness of mental health issues; but Alex, from Sussex, has not spoken at length about his father\u2019s death before. \u201cMy family was broken,\u201d he begins. His father was an alcoholic, and in the year before his suicide he lost his driving licence, his job, and the phone was disconnected. He killed himself on 29 October 1991, aged 44, when Alex was away with friends.\n\nBefore leaving for that trip, Alex says, \u201cI got home after my Saturday shift at McDonald\u2019s, and saw Dad asleep, slumped in the corner of the kitchen, absolutely paralytic, all the dirty dishes piled up. I tried to wake him and he went for me. He kneed me in the balls, tried to headbutt me.\u201d His brother broke up the fight. \u201cThe emotion broke. I was outside, crying and angry. Something inside snapped and I said, \u2018I\u2019m never going to cry about this again.\u2019\u201d His jaw clenches as he explains what happened next: his father tried to apologise, but Alex slammed the door and walked out. That was the last time they saw each other.\n\nPaul, the younger man, identifies the link between their experiences. \u201cI think you\u2019ve probably trained yourself not to show your emotions. But as you were talking, one emotion came through that I can relate to massively, and that\u2019s guilt. As you were talking about what you didn\u2019t do, I could see you starting to well up. It\u2019s the same with me.\u201d\n\nBoth men spent their young adulthood hiding their grief. \u201cI was 19, and I\u2019d drive to work crying my eyes out,\u201d says Paul. \u201cThen I\u2019d get to work, and it was: \u2018Everyone all right?\u2019 and then I\u2019d get back in the car and cry.\u201d\n\nPart of me thinks \u2013 even knows, deep down \u2013 that you never get over it. There\u2019s something about it that wrenches you\n\n\u201cIn the year or two afterwards, I was the archetypal angry young man,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI had my head shaved, a big gold earring, I was like a red mist on a hair trigger. A lot of people saw this horrible man when I was out \u2013 and then I\u2019d be in bed weeping, with no one to offload on to.\u201d\n\nWhile Paul found a therapist, Alex has never felt able to. \u201cMy wife says, \u2018You\u2019re so unemotional, Alex.\u2019 She doesn\u2019t see that sometimes when she goes to bed, I get some old photo albums out, with the suicide letter. I can get quite weepy, and I feel very lucid in myself about my emotions. I can have a conversation with myself about how I feel. But when she walks in, I\u2019ll freeze. We have no secrets and I love her dearly, but I still find it hard to let go.\u201d\n\nBoth agree that social attitudes around mental health have changed for the better \u2013 but not around suicide. \u201cThere was definitely a stigma,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI always joked about it: when people asked how he died, I\u2019d say, \u2018The usual way \u2013 he stopped breathing.\u2019 I used to hate myself for doing that.\u201d\n\nPaul thinks little had changed by 2009. \u201cI remember my dad saying \u2018Be careful near the local psychiatric hospital, because there\u2019s loads of loonies and nutters that might be round there,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIf that\u2019s what he was conditioned to believe, then that\u2019s probably why he was silent for so long.\u201d\n\nWhen Paul asks how it felt this year to outlive the age at which his father died, Alex says that he felt as if a weight had been lifted. \u201cI\u2019ve almost found it\u2019s freed me up a bit. I\u2019m writing my own story now. I\u2019ve got past the point where he was, and it\u2019s uncharted territory.\u201d\n\nFor Paul, it is talking that has been freeing. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve dealt with it \u2013 there are still times when it\u2019s horrible,\u201d he says. Alex agrees. \u201cPart of me thinks \u2013 even knows, deep down \u2013 that you never get over it. There\u2019s something about it that just wrenches you. But this is the longest I\u2019ve spent talking about it. It\u2019s part of the feeling that the road is opening up.\u201d\n\n\u2018Gay marriage is a symbol; it\u2019s society trying to do better\u2019\n\n\n\nTochi Onuora, 20, and Jean Thomson, 90, were both outed at school\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018There is still a feeling that this isn\u2019t quite OK\u2019: Tochi Onuora and Jean Thomson. Photograph: Kensington Leverne/The Guardian\n\nSitting in his host\u2019s living room, surrounded by her books and newspapers, Tochi is telling Jean what it was like being outed at school, 70 years after she was. He was 13 and had come out to close friends when, suddenly, everyone seemed to know he was gay. \u201cI had a support network, and people\u2019s reactions weren\u2019t bad, so I was fine \u2013 relieved, almost. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the usual experience,\u201d he says.\n\nIt was not Jean\u2019s experience: at 12, she fell in love with a girl of 14 at her Scottish boarding school. \u201cShe was going to be a musician, and if you had some time off during the day you could go and see her practising the piano.\u201d Love notes between this musician and a few other girls were discovered in their underwear drawers. Her voice falls as she describes the traumatic school disciplinary process that followed, in which Jean was forced to admit they had kissed. \u201cI was called as a witness. It was humiliating. She didn\u2019t play the piano after that. It was a dreadful thing to do to her, and it was a terrible thing to happen to me, too. I never really recovered,\u201d she says.\n\nJean feels an enduring sense of isolation. Tochi\u2019s experience of growing up gay has been less lonely, he says, in part because of technology. \u201cI have a sense of being different, but I\u2019m an ethnic minority, as well, so I\u2019m not unused to that. Then again, I\u2019ve grown up with the internet, and if I hear something negative and I want to find reassurance, I\u2019ll do some research. And then I can say, actually, I\u2019ve read these 10 articles and seen this person talking about it on YouTube. I might see someone has posted on my university\u2019s LGBT+ social media channels, and I\u2019d feel comfortable approaching them in real life. It\u2019s less isolating.\u201d\n\nI could not have had this conversation with a gay man 20 years ago \u2013 there would have been more of a sense of danger\n\nJean tells of a period in her life when she also found a community. While lesbianism was not illegal \u2013 unlike male homosexuality, which was only partially decriminalised in 1967 \u2013 it still felt that way. Jean\u2019s voice lifts as she describes developing a circle of gay women friends through the Minority Research Group, formed in London in 1963. \u201cI read an advertisement for it, and recognised that it was a gay thing.\u201d There she met two women activists, Esm\u00e9 Langley and Diana Chapman, who \u201chad decided there were too many isolated gay women. Women from all over the country flocked there; it was really the beginning of the gay women\u2019s movement.\u201d\n\nJean asks Tochi how the history of the criminalisation of homosexuality affects him. \u201cAt school, I knew if someone said something homophobic, I could go to a teacher,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that privilege of not having to think about it on a legal level is very different. But there is still a feeling that this isn\u2019t quite OK, and that means you might delay coming out, or just get very good at performing.\n\n\u201cSometimes, at a time when some of the legal versions of discrimination have been addressed, it means, when you do complain about something, people think they resolved it 15 years ago. But I still I feel I can\u2019t go to certain places. When I see a St George\u2019s flag I cross the street, because I feel like that\u2019s a symbol of someone who doesn\u2019t agree with my existence. People think we solved racism and discrimination against LGBT people. I\u2019m like, no, we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTheir views differ on the issue of gay marriage: for Jean, it is \u201can unnecessary addition to the gay world. I don\u2019t see any reason to be the same as people who are having heterosexual partnerships.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was really happy about it,\u201d says Tochi. \u201cIt\u2019s society recognising that it hasn\u2019t been good enough, and trying to do better for LGBT people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think things have changed quite considerably, but it\u2019s still difficult,\u201d says Jean. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have had this conversation with a gay man 20 years ago \u2013 there would have been much more of a sense of danger about it all.\u201d\n\nTochi laughs. \u201cTwenty years ago! That\u2019s when I was born.\u201d\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).\n\nComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.
