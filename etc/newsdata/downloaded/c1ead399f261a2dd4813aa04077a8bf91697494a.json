To the contrary, they should be abolished altogether.\n\nD.C.\u2019s Bias-Related Crime Act allows prosecutors to seek, and judges to hand down, sentences significantly greater (up to 50 percent greater) than would otherwise be the case if it is somehow determined that the crime was committed based on the victim\u2019s age, sex, race, religion, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, and other distinguishing characteristics.\n\nThe array of victim classes receiving special protection vary in the 45 states that have hate-crimes laws on their books, as does the extent of sentence enhancement.\n\nBut that raises a pointed question: Why should special classes of victims of crime get preferential treatment? That is to say, how exactly is an assault on, or the killing of a woman, a black person, a homosexual, a Muslim, or a transgender person more heinous than the very same crime committed against a man, a Caucasian, or someone who\u2019s straight?\n\nThe simple answer is: It isn\u2019t \u2014 or at least it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 because hate-crimes laws are, in a word, Orwellian.\n\nIn George Orwell\u2019s dystopian 1945 allegorical novel \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d where pigs controlled the government, all animals were declared equal, but some animals \u2014 not surprisingly, the pigs \u2014 were \u201cmore equal than others.\u201d\n\nThe flip side of asking why some crime victims are \u201cmore equal than others\u201d is this: Why should a perpetrator who assaults or kills a gay black man or an Asian woman be punished more severely \u2014 and spend a single additional day in jail or prison \u2014 than if he or she had committed the exact same crime against, say, a straight, white male?\n\nAs prescient as he was, Orwell couldn\u2019t possibly have foreseen today\u2019s political correctness, but he had it right. Hate-crime statutes turn the concept of equal justice under the law on its head by making some Americans more equal than others.\n\nEvery criminal perpetrator should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law \u2014 regardless of the victim\u2019s skin color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other such characteristic.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ms. Liu shouldn\u2019t bow to Ms. Norton\u2019s demands.\n\nEven without hate-crime enhancements, D.C. laws against assault and homicide are presumably sufficient for bringing justice to the victims of the 59 instances last year in which D.C. police made arrests in so-called hate-crime cases.\n\nOn Oct. 28, it will be 10 years since then-President Obama signed the federal Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law. It expanded an existing U.S. federal hate-crime law to apply to crimes motivated by a victim\u2019s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.\n\nTo the extent that they render some victims more equal than others before the law, that law and all the state hate-crimes statutes are prima facie unconstitutional.\n\nDespite that, no one convicted under hate-crime laws has ever taken a constitutional challenge all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But someone should.\n\nAnd when the federal law comes up for congressional reauthorization, it should instead be sunsetted. That said, we\u2019re not optimistic that will happen, because of GOP gutlessness and Democratic demagoguery.\n\nAnyone who argues, correctly, that hate-crime laws are discriminatory and unconstitutional and should be repealed will, as surely as night follows day, be branded as a \u201cracist,\u201d \u201chater\u201d and \u201cbigot.\u201d\n\nTo the contrary, advocating repeal of hate-crime laws would be an act of fidelity to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
