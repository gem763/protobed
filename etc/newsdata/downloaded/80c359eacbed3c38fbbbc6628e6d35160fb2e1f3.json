They will only do this if they believe wrongdoing will be caught and punished, he said, as he slammed the industry\u2019s two watchdogs for a toothless performance. Stung into action and with new funding to run cases, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced a shoot-first, \u201cwhy not litigate\u201d approach, while the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said that the days of cosy settlements \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d are over. ASIC started 13 new cases, and warned in August of a wave of more legal actions by Christmas.\n\nNow the regulatory charge has run headlong into a brick wall of sceptical judges. The first two high-profile court cases to be concluded in the post-Hayne era have now been embarrassingly thrown out, with stiff criticism from the bench of the very basis and means by which they were run.\n\nLast week Federal Court judge Jayne Jagot rejected APRA\u2019s case that IOOF had wrongly and out of greed used a reserve of members\u2019 own money to refund member losses, and that IOOF directors should be disqualified. Justice Jagot said that APRA had failed to prove the primary facts against IOOF, and the \u201ccase theory was tenuous in the extreme\u201d. And on one reading, it is not clear that former chief executive Chris Kelaher breached his director\u2019s duties, or that the reserves were members\u2019 money, or that there was any problem with the way IOOF used the money. That is very different from what was portrayed by APRA or at the Hayne commission.\n\nThis is a month after ASIC failed to show that Westpac had breached the irresponsible lending laws 250,000 times because of the methods it had relied on to work out if borrowers could afford their mortgage. Westpac had already settled, but Justice Nye Perram rejected ASIC\u2019s case anyway, famously pointing out that regardless of their form-filling, borrowers know they might have to give up wagyu beef and shiraz to pay the mortgage instead.\n\nSomebody needs to ask questions. If the regulators do not know what the law is \u2013 which was the case over Westpac and IOOF \u2013 then how are financial institutions supposed to know what they are obeying? Given the severity of Mr Hayne\u2019s words, this is important.\n\nASIC is appealing the Westpac case, so that at least some legal certainty can be found. But for the finance industry, the litigatory zeal throws too much onto the inherent uncertainty of a courtroom, and constant litigation is a costly and inefficient way to make sure that an industry is following the rules, whatever they may mean. The regulators\u2019 previous penchant for companies to enter into enforceable undertakings not to repeat bad behaviour may have become too cosy. But the litigation path is quickly running into dead ends.", "description": "After ASIC and APRA fail to win two high-profile cases, financial institutions can't be certain what the law is either.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/6156f3aa4b4308a0f6be58c316e79a0fdb4cf979", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
