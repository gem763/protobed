Rather, blame a slowing U.S. economy.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s a blow to optimists arguing that the recession warning sent by this year\u2019s inverted U.S. yield curve can be safely ignored. A Friday report showing a weaker-than-expected American job market bolstered this pessimistic view.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that payroll growth is slowing and that is a worrying trend,\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief international economist, Torsten Slok, said Friday on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThis is not an economy that is falling over the cliff, but what we\u2019re debating here is what is the slope of where the economy is going? And it does look like the slope is a bit more to the downside than we had thought earlier.\u201d\n\nRates on shorter-term Treasuries -- three-month bills and two-year notes -- have surpassed those on 10-year notes in 2019, which tends to happen before U.S. economic contractions. Some have argued that this so-called inversion is sending a false recession signal. Around the world, more than $15 trillion of debt has a negative yield. Investors seeking positive rates can still find them in Treasuries, possibly distorting things.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury term premium -- or the extra compensation investors require to own the maturity rather than rolling over a shorter-dated obligation -- has fallen to record lows, which casts doubt on the yield curve\u2019s recession prediction.\n\nBut Slok points out that U.S. ISM Manufacturing data and 10-year Treasury yields have been highly correlated, suggesting that fundamental American economic data is driving the rundown in rates. Foreign holdings of Treasuries as a percent of total outstanding U.S. debt has been falling, too, while domestic sources have increased their purchases, he said.\n\n\u201cU.S. rates seem to be driven by domestic forces and not global forces,\u201d Slok wrote in an email to clients. \u201cThe bottom line is that if U.S. 10-year rates are driven entirely by U.S. economic fundamentals then this also implies that we in markets put too much weight on the arguments that weak global growth and the savings glut are pushing down U.S. rates and the U.S. term premium.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Alix Steel, David Westin and Liz Capo McCormick.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sarah Ponczek in New York at sponczek2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Benjamin Purvis at bpurvis@bloomberg.net, Nick Baker, Liz Capo McCormick\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The sweeping bond rally that\u2019s driven Treasury yields toward record lows isn\u2019t being caused by global forces, according to Deutsche Bank AG.
