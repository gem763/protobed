The summary said that \"a few participants\" at the September meeting said prices in futures markets \"were currently suggesting greater provision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate.\"\n\nAs things stand, markets are heavily betting that the Fed will follow up its rate cuts of July and September with another in October. Markets also see more reductions on the way in 2020.\n\nBecause of the potential misunderstanding, \"it might become necessary for the Committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policymakers' own expectations for that path,\" the minutes stated.", "description": "The Fed's meeting minutes also showed that the trade war dragging down the economy was an overriding concern.", "authors": ["Jeff Cox"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106051957-1564611298676powell6.jpg?v=1564611316", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
