It\u2019s a grind; it\u2019s a struggle. Sometimes it is just flat out unbearable. But then we turn our televisions and see guys like Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban yelling at the refs during an NBA game.\n\nAs he yells, we think to ourselves, \u201cMan, I wish I had it so easy I could afford not only to own an NBA team, but the fine for yelling at the refs wouldn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nWhile Cuban has been careful in recent years when he talks about officials, he has been fined a substantial amount of money over the years by the NBA. He can afford it, of course. But while money may not be an issue for him, he has or has had problems just like the rest of us.\n\nCredit Card Declined\n\nIt happened back in 2011 after the Dallas Mavericks took down LeBron James and the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals. So, like every good, filthy rich professional sports franchise owner, he took the team out to celebrate.\n\nThey went to the Story Nightclub in Miami, where Cuban ordered a bottle of Jay-Z\u2019s champagne, Ace of Spades. To pay for it, he tried to use his new American Express Black card\u2014but it got declined.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been there. We might have been buying a round of the champagne of beers for our fantasy football league. But we\u2019ve been there. We have had to deal with the embarrassment of having our credit card declined in front of friends.\n\nBefore going any further, it is worth noting that it is not easy to get an AMEX Black card. There are specific qualifications cardholders must meet. You have to have had an AMEX card for at least a year and spend at least $100,00 to $450,000 a year. Oh\u2014and you must make at least a cool million a year and have a high net worth.\n\nCuban has all those bases covered. So, what was the issue?\n\nHouseguest From Hell\n\nHaving an unruly houseguest can make for hilarious television, but when it comes to having one\u2014nothing but problems. They eat all your food, stretch out your underwear, clog your toilet, order pay-per-view while you\u2019re at work, and they never clean up after themselves.\n\nMark Cuban had just such a houseguest once\u2014former power forward and rebounding legend, Dennis Rodman.\n\nMoping Around The House\n\nHow many times has something happened to you that made you feel like you absolutely couldn\u2019t leave the house or your room? You just lost your job or a significant other. The loss had you so down in the dumps, curling up in bed was all you wanted to do.\n\nMark Cuban has been there. But it wasn\u2019t because he lost a job or a girlfriend; his team had lost the 2006 NBA Finals, and he blamed the officials:\n\nOf course, not leaving the house for him is much different than the rest of us. His home is a 23,676 square foot mansion with ten bedrooms and 16 bathrooms. Maybe the real reason he didn\u2019t leave the house for a month was he got lost.", "description": "Mark Cuban is not your typical, run-of-the-mill professional sports franchise owner.
