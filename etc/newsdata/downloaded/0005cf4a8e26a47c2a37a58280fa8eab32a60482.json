Maybe Dwayne Haskins was thinking about something else entirely Tuesday morning \u2014 that day\u2019s lunch, perhaps? \u2014 when he tweeted one simple word from his Twitter account.\n\nBut more likely than not, the Redskins quarterback was reacting to the news that rookie Daniel Jones had just been named the New York Giants\u2018 starting quarterback, replacing Eli Manning three weeks into the season.\n\n\u201cSheesh,\u201d Haskins tweeted, 12 minutes after the Giants\u2018 announcement.\n\nWith Jones set to start Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Duke product will become the third rookie quarterback to start under center in 2019 \u2014 joining Arizona\u2019s Kyler Murray and Jacksonville\u2019s Gardner Minshew. Haskins, though, will continue to have to wait his turn.\n\nDespite the Redskins being 0-2, quarterback Case Keenum has played well enough that Washington isn\u2019t feeling any pressure to play Haskins.\n\nIn the meantime, the Redskins have set in motion a plan, so Haskins gets further development even with Keenum receiving most of the practice snaps. Besides Haskins acting as the scout team quarterback, the 22-year-old has worked closely with offensive assistant Matt Cavanaugh off to the side in practice.\n\n\u201cDwayne\u2019s development does not stop,\u201d offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s a minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, extra meetings in the mornings, extra meetings in the afternoon because he\u2019s one snap away, so he has to prepare. \u2026 He\u2019s got to be ready to go.\u201d\n\nIf Haskins is frustrated by not starting, he hasn\u2019t shown it. Since being drafted 15th overall in April, the Ohio State product has said all the right things about his role with the Redskins. Redskins coach Jay Gruden has described Haskins as not being fully ready, pointing to the fact the quarterback started just one year with the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 approach with Haskins, too, isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. Only 18 rookie quarterbacks have started from Week 1 of the regular season since 2010 \u2014 despite 117 signal-callers being drafted. Of those 18, 13 were taken in the first round. Thirty quarterbacks have been drafted in the first round this decade.\n\nEach circumstance that causes a quarterback to play can be different, as well. The Cardinals endorsed Murray, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner and the first overall pick, from the very start \u2014 trading away 2018 first-rounder Josh Rosen to the Miami Dolphins. Minshew, by comparison, started his first game in Week 2 after Nick Foles suffered a season-ending injury in the Jaguars\u2019 opener.\n\nFor Jones, the Giants are turning to their rookie after the 38-year-old Manning struggled in two straight losses. The two-time Super Bowl winner threw two interceptions in last Sunday\u2019s loss to the Buffalo Bills, and has looked like a shell of himself for years. Though the Jones pick was widely mocked \u2014 including with cameras catching Haskins shaking his head at the selection \u2014 the Giants are confident the quarterback can salvage their season.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 problems, on the other hand, have been mostly related to their lack of defense. In two games, Keenum has thrown for 601 yards, five touchdowns and has completed 69.1% of his passes with zero turnovers.\n\nTo most, Keenum has performed better than expected, quieting the immediate demand for Haskins.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not taking many sacks, he\u2019s getting out of the pocket, he\u2019s making plays, and I love his competitiveness,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI think that will rub off on the entire football team if it hasn\u2019t already. Guys like to play for him and play with him.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Sept. 5, Haskins said he\u2019ll be ready for his time, whenever the opportunity arises. He added he tries to get as much out of mental reps as he possibly can, standing behind Keenum and analyzing the reads on every play he\u2019s not under center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either that or you don\u2019t get better,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for when Haskins might start, it depends on how the rest of the Redskins\u2019 season unfolds. But looking at past situations, of the 30 first-round quarterbacks this decade, the average for their first start occurred in Week 4. Only one former first-rounder \u2014 Tennessee\u2019s Jake Locker \u2014 went without starting a game his rookie season.\n\nThe Redskins, by the way, play Jones and the Giants in Week 4.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of confidence in Dwayne right now, that if he goes in the game he can operate at a very high level,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
