However, Netgear is working on firmware updates to fix the login problems.\n\n\"We are aware of this issue and all relevant parties have been notified, there will be a fix as soon as possible,\" a Netgear spokesperson said.\n\n\"For the time being, we recommend that you manage your router using a different browser. We have confirmed that the issue does not affect Firefox or Edge.\"\n\nMost impacted devices support firmware auto-updates, but Netgear customers are advised to use another browser and make sure they install any firmware updates released in the coming days.\n\nIf Chrome users don't want to switch browsers, there's also a workaround, as detailed in this Chromium bug report from August, when the issue was first spotted during Chrome beta testing. They're advised to disable the chrome://flags/#http-auth-committed-interstitials flag until Chrome or Netgear roll out an update.\n\nHowever, this won't be necessary, as ZDNet has been told that the Chrome team plans to push a silent update that will disable this flag for all users. The update should roll out to users on September 13.", "description": "Netgear NAS device owners impacted the hardest.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/09/9db97787-51ce-41a7-9e47-c5916b0d3294/thumbnail/770x578/5e98d7b824cb15ff83ea7f9efabae19f/screen-shot-2016-12-09-at-2-04-38-pm-2.png"}
