Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D), according to Grasso\u2019s office. Mendelson and Bowser didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrasso said Monday on Twitter that he proposed the legislation to \u201cforce a vote of the full Council to finally do the right thing by ending the celebration of the misleading narrative of Christopher Columbus on the second Monday in October in honor of #IndigenousPeoplesDay.\u201d\n\nGrasso, who also opposes the Washington Redskins name, has helped to push a similar bill for the past five years. The legislation passed this week changes the name only for this year, but Grasso said he hopes to make it permanent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize the people who were already here before we came over from Europe,\u201d Grasso said. \u201cToo often we\u2019ve done a bad job recognizing Native Americans and given too much credit to Columbus.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe legislation says Columbus \u201censlaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas.\u201d It says the holiday to honor him is \u201cin reverence to a divisive figure whose actions against Indigenous People run counter to the values of equality, diversity, and inclusion \u2014 values that the District of Columbia has long embodied \u2014 and serves only to perpetuate hate and oppression, in contrast to the values the District espouses on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe District isn\u2019t alone in the Washington region in changing how it recognizes the holiday.\n\nIn Alexandria, the city council unanimously passed a resolution in September to recognize Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day as a \u201clocal, public holiday,\u201d said Craig Fifer, a city spokesman. He said the resolution was effective immediately.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Alexandria officials said, \u201cIndigenous Peoples have been and continue to be the victims of prejudice and systematic discrimination, which perpetuates high rates of income inequality and exacerbates disproportionate health, education, and social standing.\u201d\n\nThere were roughly 50,000 Native Americans in Virginia, including the Powhatan confederacy that inhabited what is now Alexandria, before English settlers arrived. There are now 11 recognized Native American tribes in Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nIn Prince George\u2019s County, council spokeswoman Karen D. Campbell said county leaders passed legislation changing Columbus Day to Native American Day. The legislation was passed Sept. 10 and goes into effect Nov. 8.\n\nAD\n\nBarry Hudson, a spokesman for the Montgomery County executive, said there are no plans to rename the Columbus Day holiday in that county. The city of Takoma Park, in Montgomery, has recognized Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day since 2017.\n\nThe issue hasn\u2019t been discussed publicly in Fairfax or Arlington counties.\n\nColumbus Day, named for the Italian explorer, is celebrated annually on the second Monday in October. The federal holiday recognizes Columbus\u2019s landing in 1492 in the Americas. It first was celebrated as a federal holiday in the 1930s.\n\nThe D.C.-area jurisdictions are among several states and local governments across the country that have recognized Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day, acknowledging harm done to Native Americans and celebrating their history. In the past decade, more than 130 cities have declared Columbus Day as Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians, an advocacy group that represents Native American tribal governments and Alaska Native groups, applauded the District\u2019s name change for the holiday.\n\n\u201cIn a city that itself sits on Piscataway land, we commend the D.C. Council for voting to join the growing number of cities, counties, states, and school districts in formally celebrating Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day,\u201d NCAI chief executive Kevin Allis said in a statement. \u201cIt also acknowledges American Indians and Alaska Natives as thriving, contemporary sovereign nations who hold their rightful place among the American family of governments.\u201d\n\nRebecca Tan, Antonio Olivo and Patricia Sullivan contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Alexandria and Prince George\u2019s County also changed the name of the holiday.", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bm8y5MQv68reeRzql4unijwriD8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AALGQL424BHXNKT6KNUPH5CHTU.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
