Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Mike Braun (R-IN), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Mike Lee (R-UT) penned a letter over the summer in which they requested the FDA consider opening up that parallel track to include other drugs that treat serious illnesses.\n\n\u201cIn recent years the FDA has sought to streamline its drug approval process\u2026[h]owever, significant barriers to ready access remain,\u201d the Senators wrote on May 17. \u201cDespite FDA's efforts, it still takes on average 10 to 12 years and as much as $2.8 billion to bring a new treatment from lab to patients. Many patients with critical illnesses cannot wait that long. One unused solution that the FDA already has at its disposal is to expand the already existing Parallel Track to other diseases.\u201d\n\nIf the FDA were to agree to meet the Senators\u2019 request, new Republican-led health care legislation intended to lower the overall cost of health care could include this first step toward a permanent parallel track.\n\nSuch a track could operate largely independently of the FDA once a drug had passed Phase I, but data would be gathered in tandem so the agency could continue its clinical trial phases while those who need access to the drugs immediately could work with their trained physicians to serve as in-the-wild collectors of data.\n\nBut the creation of a parallel track is only half the equation. The other side comes down to the creation of market incentives for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make their drugs available on the market following Phase I approval.\n\nAnd how will pharmaceutical manufacturers be convinced it\u2019s in their interest to advocate for a parallel track, either within the FDA or as an independent yet tandem version? Avik Roy at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP) proposes a few ways to shift the marketplace in that direction. While Roy favors a expanding the accelerated access program within the FDA, his ideas about opening up competition apply universally:\n\nWe propose closing loopholes that manufacturers are using to suppress competition for older drugs. We explore avenues for reducing the barriers to market for biosimilar drugs that can, through competition, reduce the price of newer, biologic medicines. We propose expanding the FDA\u2019s \u201cfast track designation\u201d to not only apply to \u201cunmet medical needs\u201d but also \u201cunder-met medical needs\u201d where competition is low. We also seek to reduce the cost of innovation, by expanding the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval process to encompass large public health problems, like cardiovascular and metabolic disease, where the cost of innovation is highest and where pricing power is lowest, due to the availability of inexpensive generic drugs. We propose requiring an up-or-down vote in Congress for FDA regulations with an economic cost greater than $100 million.\n\nIf some of these regulatory changes can be accomplished, the monopoly the federal government has on drug approvals may begin to mitigate with discussion of a real parallel track for drug approvals. The FDA can get back to controlled clinical trials where it shines, and sick people in dire need of emerging and experimental medications will be free to choose to work with doctors to try some of these lifesaving therapies on their own.\n\nSarah Lee is a freelance writer and policy wonk living and working in Washington, DC.", "description": ".10/19/2019 10:06:34AM EST.", "authors": ["Sarah", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/340/119b4753-d129-4104-8278-68f874bf51d0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
