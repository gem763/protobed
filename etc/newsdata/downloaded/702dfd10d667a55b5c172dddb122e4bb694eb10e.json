Instead of giving Biden credit, Warren responded by thanking Barack Obama.\n\nOn Thursday, Warren made an impassioned appeal for her plan for universal child care, which would be financed by a wealth tax. \u201cWe\u2019re the richest country in the history of the planet,\u201d she said. \u201cAccess to high-quality care and education during the first five years of a child\u2019s life shouldn\u2019t be a privilege reserved for the rich.

The money raised will go to Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee that supports his campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n\nTrump Victory, which can accept contributions in amounts of as much as $360,600, has raised $65.2 million in 2019. Overall, Trump and the RNC have raised more than $300 million this year. When Trump holds his rallies, he also raises funds from small-dollar donors through his other joint fundraising committee, Trump Make America Great Again, by selling hats, t-shirts and other campaign memorabilia.\n\nIn between the fundraiser and the rally, Trump made a stop in Alvarado, Texas, to take part in a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a factory manufacturing Louis Vuitton products. The French luxury conglomerate LVMH opened the plant to follow through on a pledge by its chairman Bernard Arnault to create more U.S. manufacturing jobs. -- Bill Allison\n\nBiden and Warren Tied in Iowa, Buttigieg Third (1:55 p.m.)\n\nJoe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are in a dead heat for the top spot in Iowa, with Pete Buttigieg making a credible claim for third place in the first Democratic nomination battle of the 2020, according to a new survey.\n\nBiden and Warren each have 23% support, according to a landline phone poll and internet survey by Emerson Research released on Thursday. Buttigieg has 16%, surpassing Bernie Sanders\u2019s 13% but within the poll\u2019s 3.2 percentage-point margin of error.\n\nWarren\u2019s steady rise in Iowa has come largely at the expense of Sanders. Among Iowa caucus-goers who supported Sanders in 2016, 19% still support the Vermont senator and 26% now support Warren. Biden has the support of 42% of Iowa caucus-goers who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. -- Gregory Korte\n\nWarren Picks Up Endorsements of 24 Iowa Leaders (12:54 p.m.)\n\nElizabeth Warren received the endorsements of 24 Democratic leaders in Iowa, the state that holds the critical first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest.\n\nThe endorsers include former Iowa Lieutenant Governor Sally Pederson, former Iowa Secretary of State Elaine Baxter, and Mary Wolfe, a state representative.\n\n\u201cElizabeth is the candidate for change,\u201d Pederson wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday by the Gazette in Cedar Rapids. \u201cShe understands that to rescue our democracy and our economy we must end the corruption that enriches the few while leaving everyone else behind.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Elizabeth Warren said Thursday the time had come to \u201cchange the face of power\u201d by electing more women to all levels of government, as she made a pitch to become the first female U.S. president.\u201cLet\u2019s elect more women so we can create the America of our highest ideals,\u201d Warren said during", "authors": ["Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NBocvWU2779ZvcehV4h9lQ--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1d22ecb824d1f349d0be4e1d1e44631f", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
