A heavy defeat would only have increased the pressure on Marco Silva after last weekend\u2019s defeat to Sheffield United.\n\nHe was not even the master of his own technical area at times, with Guardiola once needing to apologise for straying into his counterpart\u2019s space. This was a much-improved performance from the one which preceded it, and Everton had opportunities to make sure they earned a positive result, but a fourth defeat in five games does little to help Silva\u2019s cause. MC\n\nChelsea can lack cutting edge\n\nChelsea had 17 shots on goal in the first half against Brighton & Hove Albion \u2013 but still trooped in goalless at the break.\n\nThey required a Jorginho penalty, after Adam Webster tripped Mason Mount, to finally break the deadlock before Willian struck late on to secure a first home league win of the season.\n\nChelsea have made clear improvements in recent matches and the electric start made by Tammy Abraham has been very encouraging \u2013 but the club will require far more goals from their midfielders if they are to finish in the top four for a second successive season. LB\n\nWolves win offers brief respite\n\nWolves\u2019 2-0 win over Watford, thanks to Matt Doherty\u2019s opener and Daryl Janmaat\u2019s own goal, lifted them out of the bottom three and gave a much-needed boost to a league campaign which has been hampered by their Europa League commitments.\n\nThe club\u2019s first European campaign for 39 years began back in July with the qualifying rounds and Wanderers have reached the group stage of the competition but Nuno admits they have had no time to work on their game in training as a result.\n\nWolves travel to Turkey this week to face Besiktas on Thursday and then face a tough trip to the Etihad Stadium to play champions Manchester City three days later. ART\n\nSpurs show their grit\n\nTottenham\u2019s start to the season has seen Mauricio Pochettino come under more pressure than at any previous point in his managerial career.\n\nHis team\u2019s 2-1 win over Southampton was by no means perfect \u2013 Serge Aurier\u2019s brainless sending off and Hugo Lloris\u2019 gaffe ensured that \u2013 but it was gritty, hard-fought and tenacious, something Harry Kane was keen to point out while speaking to reporters after the match.\n\n\u201cIt was [a massive result],\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we have had a couple of disappointing results recently, and going down to 10 men after 30 or 40 minutes, whatever it was, it was tough. Absolutely, it showed the character of the team. We\u2019re going through a tough spell, but we put everything out on the pitch and I think we deserved the victory.\u201d LB\n\nLeicester shine without Maddison\n\nThey may only have been faced by the paltriest of offerings from Steve Bruce\u2019s \u201csurrendered\u201d Newcastle, but Leicester proved they can flourish without their creative heartbeat as they thrashed Newcastle 5-0 at the King Power Stadium.\n\nWith Maddison shaking off the last remnants of an ankle injury, Foxes fans were treated to their Juliper Pro League ensemble of Wilfred Ndidi, Youri Tielemans and Dennis Praet and the trio dominated their listless opponents, commanding possession, controlling the space and leaving the ten-man Magpies half-heartedly chasing shadows.\n\nPerhaps the greatest question hanging over Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side was whether they have the depth to sustain their brilliant start to the season \u2013 namely if Maddison or Jamie Vardy are absent. The answer was resounding. They end the weekend in third and there can be few arguments that Leicester cannot be genuine top-four contenders come the end of the season. TK\n\nCity win while not at their best...\n\nEven for a side with the quality of Manchester City, three points do not always come easy. For long periods of this valuable win at Goodison Park, it seemed as if the reigning Premier League champions could fail to win for the third time in eight league games, handing a significant advantage to the contenders and pace-setters across Stanley Park.\n\nGabriel Jesus\u2019 opener was cancelled out by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. But Pep Guardiola\u2019s remain composed and eventually profited through the excellent Riyad Mahrez and the otherwise-wasteful Raheem Sterling. Jordan Pickford\u2019s role in both goals will be questioned. The result continues Everton\u2019s disappointing run of form, but City will only care that the gap at the top remains five points. MC\n\n... and so do league rivals Liverpool\n\nThis match was the first since the January meeting with Brighton in which the Reds didn\u2019t hit the target in the first half despite seven attempts.\n\nLiverpool were flustered with the winner down to a horrendous error from Dean Henderson rather than Liverpool skill. Victories do not get much luckier.\n\nBut the crucial thing was that Liverpool got the job done. They are still sitting pretty at the top of the Premier League table, five points ahead of Manchester City. Seven matches. Seven wins. They will take some stopping.
