But Apple devices often appear in filings right around their announcement. For example, the FCC filings for the AirPods Pro, which were announced on Monday, also showed up in the FCC that same day.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit found in filings is that some Mac Pros may be assembled in China. That\u2019s surprising to see, as Apple announced in September that the computer would be manufactured in Austin, Texas. You can see the \u201cAssembled in China\u201d language on this picture of a label on the Mac Pro in the FCC filings:\n\nOf course, there are some explanations for this. Apple may be manufacturing some Mac Pro parts in China and shipping them to Austin. The company could also be splitting up manufacturing and assembly between China and Texas, depending on demand and part availability. The prior-generation Mac Pros had been assembled in Austin, and had the phrase \u201cAssembled in the USA\u201d printed on them to indicate that they included components from overseas manufacturers.\n\nThat said, Apple specifically asked the Trump administration back in July for an exemption on the tariffs imposed as part of the ongoing US-China trade war. When the company announced in September that it would be manufacturing the computer in Austin, that seemed like a move designed to appease Trump. Regardless, Apple was still hit with a 25 percent tax on five Mac Pro parts later that same month, in accordance with the tariff policy.\n\nBut the most important reason you shouldn\u2019t read much into \u201cAssembled in China\u201d is that Apple CEO Tim Cook debunked it during Apple\u2019s Q4 earnings call today, doubling down on the idea that they\u2019ll be produced in Austin, Texas. As far as Apple is concerned, nothing\u2019s changed.\n\nUpdate, 5:17 PM ET: Added Tim Cook\u2019s double-down on Austin, Texas during today\u2019s Q4 earnings call.", "description": "When Apple announced its redesigned Mac Pro this June, the company didn\u2019t give a release date more specific than \"this fall\" \u2014 but the powerful new computer has just shown up in FCC filings, which could indicate an imminent launch.
