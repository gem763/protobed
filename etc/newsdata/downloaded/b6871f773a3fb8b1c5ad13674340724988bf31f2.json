I did expect to have a larger baby as I had gestational diabetes but not this big,\u201d Emma said. \u201cAt 35 weeks an ultrasound revealed she was about 4kg but we didn\u2019t think she\u2019d grow that much more.\u201d\n\nBaby Remi was born at Wollongong Hospital in New South Wales via an emergency C-section and is said to be doing well. She is the couple\u2019s third child \u2013 their other daughter weighed 5,5kg at birth and their son weighed 3,8kg.\n\nMidwives at the hospital said the baby was the heaviest newborn they\u2019d delivered at the institution and dad Daniel admitted his daughter had caused quite a stir.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve walked around with her there\u2019s always a crowd of people \u2013 midwives, other new parents and visitors \u2013 around her, asking about her size because she\u2019s so much bigger than all the other newborns. She\u2019s definitely making an impression,\u201d he said.\n\nThe world record for the \u201cheaviest birth\u201d has been unbroken since 1879 when Anna Bates, who was 2,43m tall herself, gave birth to a 9,98kg baby boy. He died 11 hours later.", "description": "While the average newborn baby, born between 37 and 40 weeks, ranges from 2,3kg to 4kg in size, one Australian mother recently gave birth to hefty 5,88kg bundle of joy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9469/b449bafdac6f4749a8f303ebcb4f5082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
