The contract soared as much as 19.5% on Monday to $71.95 per barrel, the biggest jump in history.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate futures slipped 84 cents, or 1.34%, to $62.07 per barrel after posting their biggest climb since 2008 in the previous session.\n\nThe largest oil processing facility at Abqaiq and the nearby oil field was attacked on Saturday, knocking out 5.7 million barrels of daily crude production or more than half of the kingdom's oil output. Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, reportedly could take weeks before it can restore the majority of its output at Abqaiq.\n\n\"Geopolitical events have a historic tendency of exaggerated initial impact in markets, with a smaller economic and market impact emerging over a short period of time,\" Steven Wieting, Citi's chief investment strategist, said in a note. \"The degree of any escalation with Iran is the more critical issue for longer-lasting supply risks. Temporary disruptions for repairs inside Saudi are very different.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday he's in no rush to respond to the coordinated attack. When asked if Iran was behind it, Trump said \"It's certainly looking that way at this point.\"\n\nIranian president Hassan Rouhani said the attacks on Aramco were a \"reciprocal response\" to the aggression against Yemen.\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said initial investigations have indicated that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian weapons. \"Investigations are still ongoing to determine the source of the attack,\" it said.\n\n\"Going forward, the main driver of prices will be time, specifically how long the Saudi production facilities will be offline,\" Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report, said in a note on Tuesday.", "description": "Oil fell on Tuesday after surging the most on record following attacks on Saudi's oil industry that disrupted the kingdom's production.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106132459-1568663188635gettyimages-1168377310.jpeg?v=1568694177", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
