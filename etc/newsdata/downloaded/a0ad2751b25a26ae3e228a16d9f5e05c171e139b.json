Among the things that went wrong were an interception by Dak Prescott on a deep shot to Randall Cobb and other misfires as Prescott looked for big plays against the Dolphins defense.\n\nDallas would score two touchdowns on their first two possessions in the third quarter to finally break the game open and Prescott explained the adjustments he made to get things moving back in the right direction.\n\n\u201cI just had to get back. I was being too greedy,\u201d Prescott said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \u201cOne of those heat checks or whatever you call it, just trying to do too much in the first half. I said it to Kellen [Moore] at the end of the game that at the end of the first half, I was just being greedy. That\u2019s why I said it\u2019s a good tape to learn from, probably for me more than anybody else; just take what the defense gives me. I want these shots; you hit these shots in a couple of games, and you want them again, you get anxious. But, taking it down with those backs will get just as many yards as those deep throws and allowing the game to come to me is what I did in the second half.\u201d\n\nPrescott finished 19-of-32 for 246 yards, two touchdowns and that interception. That wasn\u2019t his best day of the season, but 228 rushing yards from Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard \u2014 and a rushing score for the quarterback \u2014 made it clear that the Cowboys didn\u2019t need Prescott to do as much through the air as he was trying to do early in the contest.", "description": "Sunday's game between the Cowboys and Dolphins was much closer at halftime than most people predicted.
