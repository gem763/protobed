REUTERS/Michele Tantussi\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Solutions still need to be found for customs arrangements in Northern Ireland to clinch a Brexit deal and European Union leaders could yet meet again if they do not reach an agreement at this week\u2019s summit, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel said on Thursday.\n\nThe German chancellor said the British government had shown \u201ca readiness to negotiate with very concrete proposals\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere has been movement in recent days, significant movement ... so we are on a better path than before but, today I must say very clearly, we have not reached the goal yet,\u201d Merkel told Germany\u2019s Bundestag lower house of parliament.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s last-ditch attempt to clinch a Brexit deal was thrown into disarray just hours before an EU summit on Thursday when the Northern Irish party he needs to help ratify any agreement refused to support it.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the summit, Merkel said there had been many times in the recent past where a solution seemed to have been almost reached before things broke down, adding that she could not therefore say how the EU summit would end this week.\n\n\u201cWe do not yet have an agreement on all the questions related to customs. We need practical, realistic solutions on how the new customs controls in Northern Ireland should concretely be implemented,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAn agreement on an orderly departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union remains possible,\u201d she told lawmakers, adding to loud applause: \u201cI can say that we will not allow hate and violence to flare up on the island of Ireland again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will negotiate until the last second,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf necessary, we can meet again for an extraordinary (European) Council. But let\u2019s see what happens here. Even if we are well prepared for a disorderly exit, an orderly Brexit is of course in everyone\u2019s interests.\u201d", "description": "Solutions still need to be found for customs arrangements in Northern Ireland to clinch a Brexit deal and European Union leaders could yet meet again if they do not reach an agreement at this week's summit, Germany's Angela Merkel said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441794495&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0IQ", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
