Kurdish fighters were seen preparing for battle in Syria on Thursday. (Oct 11) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 George Conway, conservative lawyer and husband to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull U.S. troops out of northeastern Syria as making a \"colossal geopolitical blunder of historic significance.\"\n\nIn a series of tweets sent Monday, Conway, who is a consistent critic of the President, said Trump has \u201cfailed miserably\u201d and is \u201cincompetent and ignorant.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo amount of your desperate, whiny, and pathetic tweeting can undo that simple fact,\u201d he said, quoting one of Trump\u2019s tweets that claims he defeated \u201c100% of the ISIS Caliphate.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s decision has cleared the way for Turkey to launch a military offensive in the region, as it views a Kurdish militia that dominates the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces as a terrorist group.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump: You\u2019re incompetent and ignorant, and you\u2019ve failed miserably, having made a colossal geopolitical blunder of historic significance. No amount of your desperate, whiny, and pathetic tweeting can undo that simple fact. https://t.co/QHnjldms62 \u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 14, 2019\n\nCritics of the decision have come from both sides of the aisle, and they argue the action has betrayed a close U.S. allyship with the Kurds and risks creating a chaotic and dangerous situation where thousands of Islamic State group fighters languish in Kurdish-run detention centers.\n\nMore: Gordon Sondland, Syria talks, Columbus Day: 5 things you need to know Monday\n\nConway continued Monday to call out conservative lawmakers for not saying the President\u2019s name as they critiqued the policy decision in their tweets, and the hashtag #SayHisName was trending.\n\n\u201cBravo,\u201d he told Rep. Adam Kinzinger who is an Air Force veteran, \u201cOther Republicans should #SayHisName, just like this.\u201d\n\nDespite reports emerging that hundreds of ISIS supporters have escaped Kurdish-established detention camp, Ain Issa, after Turkish airstrikes hit the area and that the Kurds announcing a deal with Syria\u2019s Russian backed government, Trump has defended the move.\n\nAdditionally, on Monday, Trump repeated a threat to impose sanctions on Turkey, tweeting out a lengthy statement that was short on specifics: \u201cThis Order will enable the United States to impose powerful additional sanctions on those who may be involved in serious human rights abuses, obstructing a ceasefire, preventing displaced persons from returning home, forcibly repatriating refugees, or threatening the peace, security, or stability in Syria.\u201d\n\nStatement from President Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\n\"Yes, Turkey should sanctioned,\" Conway blasted Monday, continuing that he believes that Trump \"should be sanctioned too, for your idiocy, ignorance, ineptitude, impulsivitity, and your infidelity to our nation\u2019s interests, in making the decision you were told would lead to the calamitous consequences we\u2019ve now seen.\"\n\nContributing: David Jackson, John Fritze, and Courtney Subramanian\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/14/george-conway-trump-syria-decision/3979139002/", "description": "George Conway, husband to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, blasted the Trump, and also called out GOP lawmakers who didn't mention the president in their critiques", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
