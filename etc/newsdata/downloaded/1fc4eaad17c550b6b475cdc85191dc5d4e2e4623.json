Based on that, airlines have begun to lay the groundwork for returning the planes to service. For example, American is working closely with the Allied Pilots Association, which represents its pilots, on training and other issues.\n\nAmerican\u2019s expected date for resuming service with the Max would make it the last of the major carriers to resume flying the plane under dates that have been announced. Southwest Airlines, which has the most Max jets of any U.S. carrier, has removed the plane from its schedule until Jan. 5, while United Airlines has removed the Max from its schedule until Dec. 19.\n\nAD\n\nAmerican\u2019s announcement comes near nearly seven months after regulators around the world grounded the Max in the wake of two fatal crashes that killed 346 people.\n\nAD\n\nThis month marks the anniversary of the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air flight that plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 passengers and crew aboard. A final report on that crash is expected later this year. Less than five months later, a 737 Max flying under the Ethiopian Airlines banner went down shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, killing all 157 passengers and crew members aboard.\n\nIn both instances, preliminary investigations pointed to issues with an anti-stall system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to compensate for changes to the plane\u2019s design.\n\nAD\n\nThe crashes have led to increased scrutiny of the process the FAA followed in certifying that the newest version of the popular 737 aircraft was safe to fly, as well as Boeing\u2019s role in that process. Both the FAA and Boeing are now subjects of numerous inquiries by congressional committees, the Transportation Department\u2019s Inspector General and the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division.\n\nAD\n\nBoeing has been working for months on software updates to the MCAS \u2014 an effort the company says has included hundreds of hours of software analysis, laboratory testing and simulator verification. In addition, it has conducted two test flights, including an in-flight certification test with the FAA, which must certify the changes before the planes can be cleared to fly.\n\nAmerican said it expects flights on the 737 Max to resume starting Jan. 16, and gradually increase throughout January and into February. The airline noted that because the number of flights on 737 Max jets will slowly increase over the course of a month, there may be additional schedule changes. Passengers affected by those changes will be contacted directly by the airline.\n\nAD\n\nAmerican said it is working on accommodations for travelers who do not wish to travel on the 737 Max once it resumes flying and will release details in coming weeks.\n\nFlights scheduled on Max planes through Jan. 6 will not be canceled. Instead, in most instances American will substitute other aircraft in their place. Schedules for travelers with reservations Jan. 7-15 will be updated on Sunday.\n\nAD", "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration maintains that it has not set a timeline for ungrounding the Max or given airlines an indication of when that might happen.", "authors": ["Lori Aratani", "Reporter Focusing On Transportation Issues", "Including Airports", "Airlines", "The Nation'S Railroad", "Subway Systems"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zIs_UvNy_p-JtsulccmMcuFqG1c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IKMWR5HKVII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
