Profits declined 26 percent to $1.88 billion, or $4.79 per share vs. estimates of $4.81. Revenue fell 6 percent to $8.32 billion.\n\nThere are concerns that Goldman is increasing variable income streams, but not its sustainable core income.\n\nThe fact that they could do so well in terms of their investment banking activities, both in terms of IPOs and in terms of mergers, and come up with numbers like this is terrible \u2014 it\u2019s just not good at all. - Dick Bove, Rafferty Capital Markets chief financial strategist\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, researchers from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods said results were mixed, but the top-line beat was driven \u201cmore by trading,\u201d which tends to be less persistent.\n\nStocks in this Article GS GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC. $206.46 +0.64 (+0.31%)\n\n\u201cInvestment banking results were weak,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cFurther a miss on provision is a negative trend for investors at this stage of the economic cycle.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Devin Ryan, senior capital markets analyst at JMP Securities, told FOX Business, that he is bullish on the overall strategy and less concerned about the quarter-to-quarter ebb and flow.\n\nIf you're going to like Goldman Sachs it's not becase the third quarter was good or not.

On Tuesday, WeWork bonds were trading below 80 cents on the dollar.\n\nRyan noted that the public markets don't always see eye-to-eye with the private markets on companies that are going public.\n\nBove said that Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon wrote off a lot of bad investments made by his predecessors and is making decisions that are necessary after years of mismanagement.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take some time for Goldman Sachs to get where people want it to be. - Dick Bove, Rafferty Capital Markets chief financial strategist\n\nRyan expects the investments the firm has been making to start generating positive return in the coming years, which will reassure the broader market.\n\n\"2020 will be a big year and 2021 will be an even bigger year,\" Ryan said, \"Right now we're looking at the opportunity vs. the reality.\"\n\nShares initially dipped during the trading day on Tuesday, before recouping losses to end the day in the green.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Do experts have faith in Solomon's vision for the company?", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/09/0/0/Goldman-sachs-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
