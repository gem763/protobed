And that trend has continued to be true with their off-menu offerings as well. If you are a connoisseur of secret menus or just enjoy dabbling in exclusivity when it comes down to mealtime, the fast-food industry is ready to deliver.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nHere are five secret menu fast food items you can try when your go-to order just isn\u2019t cutting it.\n\nIn-N-Out\u2019s 4x4 (or Quad Quad)\n\nOn days when you\u2019re feeling particularly ravenous, the California-based burger chain In-n-Out is sure to satisfy your hunger with the 4x4. Unlike what you learned in second-grade math class, the 4x4 equals four American beef patties that are paired with American cheese slices and are stacked on a bed of hand-leafed lettuce, tomato, signature spread and optional onions. These fixings are sandwiched between a freshly baked bun for an enjoyable burger experience or challenge depending on how much room your stomach has.\n\nKFC\u2019s Double Down\n\nHave you committed to no carbs but still want a dietary cheat day? KFC has a protein-filled option with its Double Down. The bunless sandwich that was introduced in 2010 makes occasional appearances on specialty menus, but it can be ordered pretty much anytime you want since it involves fried chicken, bacon, cheese, sauce and onions. You can add your own twist with whatever customization you want, but the crisp of the chicken bun is sure to steal the show.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Land, Sea and Air Burger\n\nWhen you simply can\u2019t decide what to eat, the ultra-secret McDonald\u2019s Land, Sea and Air Burger is there to cover all your bases. What does it include? An almighty Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish and McChicken combined into one dynamic meal. Ordering this gargantuan sandwich will require some assembly since it's so secret, even most employees don\u2019t know about it \u2013 but they will be nice enough to provide you all the pieces you\u2019ll need if you ask nicely.\n\nTaco Bell\u2019s Enchirito\n\nDedicated Taco Bell fans might recall the introduction of the Enchirito in the 1970s. However, the cheesy item was removed from official menus in 2013. You can still get this Mexican-inspired hybrid by ordering a standard burrito with or without sour cream and requesting it to be \u201csmothered\u201d tangy red in sauce, cheddar cheese, black olives and any other veggie you may want.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nShake Shack Peanut Butter and Bacon Burger\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of person that thinks peanut butter goes with everything, then you\u2019re not going to mind Shake Shack\u2019s secret Peanut Butter and Bacon Burger.\n\nAll you really need to do is ask for a bacon-adorned Shake Shack Hamburger or SmokeShack and request peanut sauce to be drizzled on before the bun. Or you might have to apply the sauce yourself from a provided container depending on the location you\u2019re at. The end result should be a sweet and salty confection that pleases your adventurous palate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "If ordering off a menu is too plain for your taste buds, here are five popular secret menu fast food items worth trying.", "authors": ["Cortney Moore"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/man-eating-burger_large-21bad6dd2a6ab510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
