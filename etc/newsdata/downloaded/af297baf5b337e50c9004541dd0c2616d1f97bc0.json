But the Johnson franchise is unthinkable without her now | Marina Hyde", "language": "en", "text": "Kick back and pour yourself a tech-o-tini, because there\u2019s a new political star in town \u2013 and she is finally talking. She\u2019s talking in a Los Angeles supermarket car park for now, laughing merrily while holding a large carton of almond milk. But if her lawyer gets his way, she\u2019ll be talking in a high-paying British newspaper this weekend. She is, of course, Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 model, infosec entrepreneur, and the businesswoman responsible for the technological education of Boris Johnson.\n\nMedia outlets in 'bidding war' for Jennifer Arcuri scoop Read more\n\nOn Thursday, a US attorney was fielding multiple calls attempting to broker a deal for her story. Asked if that would include her confirming a romantic relationship with Johnson, he replied: \u201cIt depends on your definition of romantic.\u201d Wow. Go on. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jennifer for 14 years. There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny of Mr Johnson. Get in the queue \u2014 if you want her services, you have to pay for it.\u201d Ought he to be making his client sound like Lol Flanders? It\u2019s not for us to judge.\n\nFor now, by way of a taster, we have Jennifer\u2019s car park chat with the Daily Mirror. I can\u2019t play favourites with the sheer volume of brilliant quotes. But how about: \u201cMen just trip over themselves in front of me. They fall in love with me in about 10 minutes \u2026 because I know what to say. I make men trip over their dicks. That\u2019s what happens. They go insane around me. They\u2019ve been doing it for years. It\u2019s just what happens.\u201d And very much fair play to her. I suppose that, literally speaking, Boris Johnson remains my prime minister. But spiritually, Jennifer Arcuri has now taken the role.\n\nMaybe you prefer the following gem, perhaps prompted by a question about the stripper\u2019s pole she had in the technology-lessons apartment: \u201cI had the best fucking flat in east London. The reason why Boris would stop over was because of the clusterfuck of emails. And he was like, \u2018Jen, what the fuck\u2019s a Google hangout? Where are you at three o\u2019clock, I can, you know, stop over.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know.\u201d And, yes, you may feel like you DO know. At first glance, Arcuri would seem to be a throwback to the golden era of kiss-and tells, epitomised for me by Bienvenida Buck (then Lady Buck), who did a primetime TV advert for the News of the World in which she purred: \u201cTomorrow I reveal how your chief of defence staff was a Torrrrrrnado in my bed.\u201d\n\nThat said, it must be stressed that Arcuri claims that there is no kissing to tell of. \u201cComplete bullshit\u201d, is her verdict. \u201cIf I was banging the dude,\u201d she opines mildly of the prime minister, \u201cand there was some kind of, like trail or sex tape, but there\u2019s nothing. There is a human side of my very complex relationship.\u201d And if you\u2019ve seen the picture of her biting the head off one of three fondant-icing Boris Johnsons on a London mayor-themed cake, you\u2019d be mad to argue with that claim of complexity.\n\nHowever unlikely this possibility may seem, I now hope against hope that she didn\u2019t actually have sex with the prime minister. The image of Boris Johnson turning up in the expectation of it, and having to listen to Silicon Valley blather while not actually getting any is my new idealised version of this story. Just picture him, asking leading questions about the stripper\u2019s pole, while she shows him how to do a PowerPoint. If there is a hell, this is what Johnson\u2019s would be like.\n\nEither way, thank God for this incredible new character. Jennifer has rocked up now, at a relatively late stage in the story, but you already couldn\u2019t imagine the franchise without her. Like Yoda, who doesn\u2019t appear until the second Star Wars movie. Ditto both Inspector Dreyfus and Cato, who only show up in the Pink Panther sequel. Indeed, in many ways, Jennifer combines different traits from all those three characters \u2013 a kind of pseudo-gnomic wisdom, allied to an incipient craziness. And a very real sense that she could judo chop the shit out of you as soon as you got through the front door.\n\nHere she is on why she was being promoted by the UK embassy in the US. \u201cI was extremely proactive. They didn\u2019t stop and go, \u2018Wait a minute, did you fuck Boris Johnson?\u2019\u201d At this point, the British ambassador inquiring, \u201cDid you fuck Boris Johnson?\u201d is about the only thing that could make the story better.\n\nAnd that is all credit to our picaresque heroine. I\u2019ll admit, I didn\u2019t get it at first. But Jennifer is, by the sounds of this, hilariously good value. Even under pressure in a supermarket car park, she is miles more amusing than Boris Johnson, whose hollowed-out narcissism has left him little more than a repository for the same seven knackered jokes and a series of second-class classics allusions. Jennifer, on the other hand, sounds like a card. I suspect she might grow a little rich for the blood in the second hour of dinner \u00e0 deux, but she\u2019d be a complete hoot to have along at a party. Party, trade mission, whatever.\n\nJennifer Arcuri 'says all allegations about her and Johnson are false' Read more\n\nAlas, having posted one of her top quotes online, I was disappointed to find gentlemen replying to sniff of Jennifer: \u201cWho talks like that?\u201d I don\u2019t know, guys. Whoever wants to? Maybe not to a reporter in a supermarket car park, I\u2019ll concede \u2026 but in the end, so what? I salute Arcuri for being able to laugh swashbucklingly about her cray-cray situation, even in the eye of the media storm. I am not remotely interested in those who are now going to question Johnson\u2019s judgment for ever going near her. She doesn\u2019t even make the cut of the top 1,000 people he should never have gone near \u2013 several of whom are in the cabinet, or bankrolled his leadership bid.\n\nYes, Jennifer Arcuri can talk how she likes and do what she likes. And while I\u2019d selfishly like that to be \u201ctalk to a Sunday newspaper and offer much more of the same\u201d, it really is up to her. For now, she\u2019s a breath of Californian air in the increasingly rancid pea-souper of our politics, and I await her next move as a decided fan.\n\n\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The prime minister\u2019s technological educator is hilariously good value, even in a supermarket car park, says Guardian columnist Marina Hyde", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d4f2287aeff29be676612caa5f6b5563717b46b/160_0_1065_639/master/1065.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e112b5619d84b0cd93b0b8e43303acea", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
