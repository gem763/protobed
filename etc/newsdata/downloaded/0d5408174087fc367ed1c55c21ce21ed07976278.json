They have been adopted by other British retailers including fashion chain New Look.\n\nBritain's retail sector is still reeling from the collapse of well known names such as Debenhams, music store HMV and department store House of Fraser.\n\nIn January this year, HMV (pictured, its branch at Westfield in Shepherds Bush) has gone into administration for the second time in six years\n\nDeloitte said it will continue to run Links of London and will explore options for a sale. It also said no job losses were being announced at this stage and the company's international operations were not directly affected.\n\nLinks of London, which sells luxury jewellery, watches, cufflinks and gifts, has around 28 standalone stores across the UK and Ireland and seven kiosks.\n\nThe jeweller's Greek owners have also faced their share of troubles. Folli Follie in August mandated Deloitte and Savigny Partners to look into the possible sale of Links of London, which it bought in 2006.\n\nTalks between Folli and its creditors over a rescue plan are at a 'critical' stage and are expected to conclude in the coming weeks, its chairman said last month.\n\nFolli has been in turmoil since a hedge fund report in May last year questioned its accounting.\n\nThe company published its delayed audited 2017 statements in July, showing it overstated annual revenue by more than 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion), and presented an alternative overhaul scheme to bondholders after a previous proposal collapsed.
