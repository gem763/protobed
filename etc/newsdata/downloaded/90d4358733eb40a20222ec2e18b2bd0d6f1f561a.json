In a long missive the Spectator published overnight, an anonymous No 10 source \u2013 widely presumed to be Dominic Cummings \u2013 predicted that Brexit talks would \u201cprobably end this week\u201d, blaming the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who, it was claimed, had \u201cgone very cold\u201d. The nameless source warned that EU countries supporting an extension of article 50 \u201cwill go to the bottom of the queue\u201d on future cooperation with the UK.\n\nWhile the incendiary briefing was being condemned on the airwaves as \u201cdesperate\u201d and something to make the government \u201cashamed\u201d by the recently departed cabinet minister Amber Rudd, Boris Johnson was on the phone to Angela Merkel. Neither London nor Berlin would offer any detailed official account of their phone call, in line with diplomatic protocol. Yet, by 10am, another explosive anonymous briefing from a No 10 source was lighting up social media with incredible claims about what the German chancellor was meant to have said. And, with that, the Brexit blame game had gone into full swing.\n\nThe unknown figure in Downing Street claimed Merkel was making a deal \u201cessentially impossible not just now but for ever\u201d by insisting that Northern Ireland must remain in full regulatory alignment and a customs union. At his regular lobby briefing at midday, Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman refused \u2013 or was unable \u2013 to say whether this was an accurate description of the meeting or represented No 10\u2019s official position.\n\nHe was listening to the phone call between Johnson and Merkel, he acknowledged, but he would only tell reporters that it had been a \u201cfull and frank exchange\u201d \u2013 a coded way of saying there had been an argument between the two leaders. Diplomatic protocol dictates that the official spokesman never comments on remarks made by a foreign leader in a confidential phone call, making the No 10 source\u2019s briefing all the more remarkable.\n\nDonald Tusk had read the reports while travelling to Berlin. The European council president was going to see Merkel at the chancellery as part of a routine tour of European capitals before next week\u2019s EU summit, where Brexit is again crowding out the agenda. Tusk, an anglophile former Polish prime minister with a sharp turn of phrase, has been deeply frustrated by what he sees as Downing Street\u2019s attempt to avoid responsibility.\n\nAs his car headed to the chancellery, he decided it was time to hit back and accused Johnson directly of playing \u201csome stupid blame game\u201d and making a deal impossible. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked in Latin.\n\nHe was not alone in that view. In Brussels, European diplomats were aghast at what they saw as the No 10 spin machine out of control. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly immature. Kids in the kindergarten behave more maturely than this,\u201d one senior diplomat said of the latest No 10 briefings. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nThe diplomat told the Guardian it might be better to simply ignore the statements, suggesting they could not represent the strategy of a serious country. \u201cThis is so strange and immature. This can\u2019t be government policy, this can\u2019t be a majority opinion in Downing Street.\u201d\n\nThe same diplomat described No 10\u2019s account of the call with Merkel as \u201can incredible distortion of facts\u201d, saying she would have repeated the EU\u2019s longstanding position that a customs border was not compatible with the UK\u2019s obligations under the Good Friday agreement.\n\nAnother diplomat described No 10\u2019s account of the call as \u201cquite shocking\u201d, pointing to claims that Merkel had apparently said Germany could leave the EU \u201cno problem\u201d if it wanted. \u201cShe would never have mentioned Germany leaving the EU - it\u2019s quite gross and ridiculous,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cFor me, it was obvious that it was designed for a domestic audience but, at the same time, how could they attribute that to the chancellor?\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees with Tusk\u2019s blazing Twitter diplomacy. Some diplomats prefer the quiet German approach. A German government spokesman declined to comment on the Merkel-Johnson call, noting: \u201cAs usual, we do not report from such confidential conversations.\u201d Privately, Berlin has long argued it would go the last kilometre for a Brexit deal, but not by jeopardising peace in Northern Ireland or the integrity of the EU single market.\n\nKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, later took aim at the shadowy nature of these briefings, saying it reflected a prime minister who did not take responsibility for his No 10 operation. A Labour MP, Alison McGovern, said it was as though \u201cthe future of our country is being briefed out as political gossip\u201d.\n\nBehind the scenes, there was some disquiet among cabinet ministers about the briefings, especially the claim in the Spectator that the UK would withdraw security cooperation from any EU state that agrees to extend article 50. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, even publicly tweeted that this idea was unacceptable.\n\nAs the day\u2019s political storm was abating, Johnson\u2019s chief envoy, David Frost, was leaving the European commission after two days of technical talks. Ensconced in the commission\u2019s star-shaped Berlaymont headquarters, EU officials have for days bombarded Frost and his team with questions, covering customs checks, exemptions for small and medium-sized businesses, agri-food regulations, timelines and transitions \u2013 the technical minutiae of a very political deal.\n\nDespite the furore, both sides insist talks have not broken down. But with the EU\u2019s unofficial end-of-week deadline looming, they are going nowhere. In months and years to come, historians may look back on this day of febrile briefings as the moment an always elusive October deal slipped out of grasp.", "description": "Blame game row as Downing Street turns fire on Leo Varadkar and Angela Merkel", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22ebe97bee176d472d3cd3a8fbe700795b4ccec/0_262_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6144b123b2f16e0850872c9ad1980d22", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
