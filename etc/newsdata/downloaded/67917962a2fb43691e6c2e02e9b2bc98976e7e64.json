General Assembly. \u201cYou know what, that was the only thing I agreed with him on.\u201d\n\nTrump has previously suggested he should be considered for a Nobel Prize for his efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.\n\nTensions in Kashmir have flared since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi moved last month to strip the territory of its autonomy and send additional troops to the majority-Muslim region after attacks by separatists that India maintains are sponsored by Pakistan.\n\n\u201cI have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi,\u201d Trump told reporters in New York. \u201cI have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan. And if at any time they say, you know, we have some points we think you can maybe iron out, I think I\u2019d be an extremely good arbitrator.\u201d\n\nTrump and Modi appeared together Sunday at a rally in Houston intended to celebrate the Indian diaspora.", "description": "The president\u2019s comments came during a meeting in New York in which he offered to mediate a dispute between India and Pakistan.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VhjF1rKdC7_CsriE-3m3BCimga0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KWC2QPG6GAI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
