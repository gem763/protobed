The Cubs are 1 1/2 games behind the Brewers for the second NL wild card, with Milwaukee set to play later Friday against Pittsburgh.\n\nChicago has totaled nine runs while losing its past four games. The Cardinals have won the first two games of this key four-game set, and they\u2019ll play the Cubs five more times over their final eight games.\n\nThe Cubs scored their run following a St. Louis error in the second inning, and the Cardinals rallied in the sixth.\n\nDavid Phelps (2-1), the second of eight Cubs relievers, walked Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna to start the inning. Steve Cishek took over and walked Matt Carpenter to load the bases before Molina grounded a 2-2 pitch up the middle.\n\nIt was another narrow victory for St. Louis. The Cardinals won 5-4 in 10 innings Thursday night when Carpenter homered off All-Star closer Craig Kimbrel. Chicago had rallied with three runs in the ninth against Martinez and Andrew Miller.\n\nMiller pitched the eighth inning Friday and got the first out in the ninth before manager Mike Shildt went to Martinez. The right-hander got a popup, walked pinch-hitter Tony Kemp and then got Ben Zobrist to ground out to complete his 22nd save.\n\nMichael Wacha pitched four innings of one-run ball for St. Louis, and five relievers shut down Chicago after that. Ryan Helsley pitched a scoreless fifth and was awarded the win.\n\nThe Cardinals left 12 men on base. Chicago left nine runners on and hit into three double plays.\n\nChicago went up 1-0 after Kyle Schwarber doubled in the second and scored from third when second baseman Tommy Edman bobbled David Bote\u2019s grounder. Bote was awarded an RBI because it was ruled that Schwarber would have scored regardless.\n\nAlec Mills pitched 4 2/3 scoreless innings for the Cubs, but the bullpen issued seven walks and couldn\u2019t hold the 1-0 lead. Mills allowed two hits and struck out six.\n\nRIZZO\u2019S RAPID RETURN\n\nAnthony Rizzo batted leadoff and played first base for the second straight day after an unexpected return Thursday from a sprained right ankle. He had a single and a walk in three plate appearances before being replaced in a double switch in the sixth.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nCardinals: 2B Kolten Wong was scheduled to have an MRI on his injured left hamstring after leaving Thursday\u2019s game in the fifth inning. Shildt didn\u2019t have results before Friday\u2019s game.\n\nCubs: RHP Brandon Kintzler (strained left oblique) said he felt good and was ready to return after being inspired by Rizzo. Kintzler last pitched Sept. 10 at San Diego.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals RHP Dakota Hudson (16-7, 3.35) takes the mound against Cubs LHP Jose Quintana (13-8, 3.35) on Saturday. Hudson is 6-1 in his last seven starts with a 1.59 ERA. Quintana has an 11.32 ERA in his last three starts and has failed to get past the third inning in his last two.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yadier Molina had three of St. Louis' four hits, including a two-run single, and the Cardinals held off the fading Chicago Cubs 2-1 on Friday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matt Carlson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/cardinals_cubs_baseball_93664_c0-265-6336-3959_s1770x1032.jpg?7ad3f755c6fba9bf0bf33fbac155ebd284a81998", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
