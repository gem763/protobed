The unseeded Arsenal, who are England\u2019s other team in the tournament and who could have faced the holders Lyon, were handed the kinder tie against Slavia Prague.\n\nWill Montemurro\u2019s small squad come back to haunt Arsenal this season? | Suzanne Wrack Read more\n\nIt has been a tough year for Duggan, who joined Barcelona alongside the star of the Netherlands\u2019 Euro 2017 campaign Lieke Martens to help usher in a new era of investment in Catalonia. She left Bar\u00e7a this summer after a season which the club ended empty handed, having lost a Copa de la Reina semi-final against Atl\u00e9tico and finished six points behind Atl\u00e9ti in the league.\n\nA somewhat surprising Champions League run, helped by a kind draw, to a first final was tempered by a bruising 4-1 defeat to Lyon. While Duggan was hardworking but fairly anonymous at one end of the pitch, a 16-minute hat-trick from Ada Hegerberg up the other end, after Dszenifer Marozs\u00e1n\u2019s early opener, stole the show and crushed Bar\u00e7a.\n\nDuggan was distraught that night. Tearstained and struggling to stay composed, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. As a footballer I want to come here and win, I don\u2019t want to just be here for the occasion. I\u2019m really sad, that\u2019s understandable right now but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll look back on it in the future and realise we created history.\u201d\n\nLooking to put the defeat behind her she left for France with England, but her World Cup campaign was hampered from the off when she picked up a thigh strain in the first training session in the French Riviera. The forward supposedly shook off that knock but did not look her usual self when out on the left wing, with the toll of a long season also undoubtedly playing its part.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Duggan takes on her England teammate Lucy Bronze of Lyon in last season\u2019s Champions League final when the striker was at Barcelona.

Duggan, having scored in Barcelona\u2019s 2-0 defeat of Atl\u00e9ti in front of a league record 60,739 fans last campaign, switched to the league winners this summer.\n\nA rollercoaster start to the season, however, has showed that this is not the same Atl\u00e9tico Madrid side that outclassed Manchester City in the round of 32 last season. In their second league game of the season, for example, they suffered a humiliating and shocking 6-1 defeat to Barcelona.\n\nA 90th-minute goal from Virginia Torrecilla ensured a 3-2 victory in Serbia against Spartak Subotica in the Champions League round of 32 first leg before a tense second game ended 1-1 to set up the meeting with City.\n\nThe team are third in the league, only a point behind Bar\u00e7a and second-placed Deportivo de la Coru\u00f1a, and it is not quite time to panic in Madrid, but with the manager Jos\u00e9 Luis S\u00e1nchez Vera departing \u2013 for personal, rather than performance-related, reasons according to the club \u2013 Atl\u00e9ti are going through a difficult period. The fairly unknown Pablo L\u00f3pez, who has managed men\u2019s teams in Segunda B and the third and fourth divisions, has stepped in until the end of the season.\n\nThe trip to the north west of England will be his second game in charge, having started with a 1-0 win at Levante on Saturday. The game on Wednesday could not have offered a bigger test of his nascent tenure.\n\nCity are flying in all competitions. Nick Cushing\u2019s team are unbeaten and have only conceded once in seven games. Revenge for last season\u2019s frustrating Champions League exit, beaten 2-0 at home after drawing 1-1 in Madrid, will be on their minds too. In Duggan, though, Atl\u00e9tico perhaps have the key to unlocking City if they can take advantage of her knowledge of the opposition manager and pick her brains on how to handle the 11 City players that she has played with internationally.", "description": "Striker has dropped out of the England reckoning after a poor World Cup but is back at her former club in the Champions League on Wednesday", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17b331894179c47e57cbdc028655a4506e49f14/0_0_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=054091980a4769cb74b08efe0d9dddaf", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
