Chu said in it that he did not expect his pseudo-vagina to make him happy, but he deserved to have a pseudo-vagina anyway, simply because he wanted it. Desire is its own justification, in other words. Chu wrote that for the rest of his life, he is going to have to insert an object into his fake vagina to prevent it from healing shut, as his body will consider it to be a wound. As I wrote in response:\n\nDo you see what\u2019s happening here? Chu says that the treatments doctors have given him are making him sicker, even making him desire suicide. But if he wants to suffer and to die, then he should have that right. Satisfying desire is the only thing that matters. This poor man with asparagus-colored hair is going to submit to mutilation next week, and will have to spend the rest of his life inserting an object into the wound surgeons will have made in his pubic area, to prevent his body from healing itself. This man \u2014 \u201clike many of my trans friends\u201d \u2014 expects this medical procedure to make him no happier, and in fact may make him feel more miserable, even suicidal. But he wants it. People like him want all of society to upend its laws, its customs, and its norms to facilitate that desire, and to act like there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. And society is giving them what they want, and punishing those who deny that this is paradise. Freeing the autonomous will from sex and gender norms is the summum bonum of contemporary American progressivism. The insatiably miserable Andrea Long Chu is its incarnation.\n\nWell, we\u2019re coming up on the one year anniversary of the casting-off of Chu\u2019s male genitalia, and the miserabilist critic sits down with New York magazine to talk about zir\u2019s new book. Excerpts:\n\nNearly a year after the surgery, she says she\u2019s feeling more miserable than she\u2019d expected. \u201cIt\u2019s perversely vindicating,\u201d she adds with a wry smile. Dressed in a jumpsuit patterned with blue-and-white flowers, she brushes a curtain of curls away from her face with a flip of her wrist, revealing a tattoo of a geometric vulva on the underside of her forearm. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous to get what you want.\u201d\n\nSo, there\u2019s some stability in Chu\u2019s life, then. More:\n\nChu was 23, a couple of years into her Ph.D. studies and in the midst of a breakup with a girlfriend, when she felt compelled to transition. Within a week, she\u2019d bought her first bra. She wasn\u2019t \u201ccoming out of the closet\u201d after years of consciously (or unconsciously) hiding; the desire to be a woman descended upon her suddenly, like \u201ca tongue of fire or an infection,\u201d as she writes in Females, and she acted on it with uncharacteristic speed. It was \u201ceasily the most impulsive thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she says.\n\nLike a possessing spirit. And:\n\nSnapping out of her reverie, she sighs and adds, \u201cNow I\u2019m just in a sexless marriage with myself.\u201d As she describes it, the root of all her unhappiness \u2014 the reason she believes there\u2019s no \u201ccure\u201d for gender \u00addysphoria \u2014 is that she will never be able to fulfill her deepest desire, which is not just to be a woman but to have always been one. \u201cIf I were to unleash the full force of dysphoria onto a conversation partner, it would be Lovecraftian in the scale of horror,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt would be like an indescribable, tentacular nightmare.\u201d And yet she\u2019s almost amused by the tragedy of it. After all, our endless striving in the face of certain failure is an essential part of what it means not to be trans but to be human. \u201cWe tell ourselves the object compels us. This person will give me what I wanted, this job, this belief, this breakup,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s desire itself that compels us. It is by nature gratuitous and without purpose. The infinite desire to desire.\u201d\n\nChu is in hell, driven by desire, but unable ever to find satisfaction for it, no matter how elaborately she masquerades, and self-mutilates.
