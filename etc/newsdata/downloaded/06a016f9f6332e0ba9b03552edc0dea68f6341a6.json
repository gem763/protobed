Wade.\n\nThe video, which was obtained by The Daily Caller, shows Katz discussing the positive implications of Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony before the University of Baltimore\u2019s Feminist Legal Theory Conference in April.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of these hearings, I believe that Christine\u2019s testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court,\u201d Katz says in the video. \u201cHe will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important; it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.\u201d\n\nAfter Kavanaugh was nominated to the High Court, Blasey Ford, a California psychology professor, accused him of tackling her onto a bed and groping her while drunk during a high-school party. During the weeks-long confirmation fight that followed, Blasey Ford and her counsel maintained that she was motivated by nothing more then a sense of civic duty, and specifically denounced the suggestion that she was politically motivated.\n\nKavanaugh unequivocally denied the allegations and no witnesses or contemporaneous evidence emerged to support Blasey Ford\u2019s account.\n\nA coalition of progressive advocacy groups is urging Congress to open an investigation into the allegations brought by Blasey Ford and other high-school and college acquaintances of Kavanaugh\u2019s.\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans made a mockery of their constitutional responsibility to provide \u2018advice and consent\u2019 on the president\u2019s nomination of Justice Kavanaugh, and the American people deserve to know how and why the process was such a sham,\u201d the groups wrote in a letter to the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees. \u201cThe public is just as entitled to a thorough review of Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s record now as it was before he was elevated to the Supreme Court and to know whether allegations against him of sexual assault and perjury have any factual basis.\u201d\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Debra Katz, the attorney for Christine Blasey Ford, who leveled sexual-assault allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, admitted during an April speech that her client's decision to come forward was partly motivated by a desire to put \u201can asterisk next to\u201d Kavanaugh's name", "authors": ["Jack Crowe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V7Nu1uEgar7wQk313.ZSmg--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/christine-blasey-ford-lawyer.jpg?fit=1024%2C597&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
