The plane is scheduled to arrive Down Under Sunday morning.\n\nPassenger numbers have been restricted to minimise the weight on board and give the plane sufficient fuel range to travel approximately 16,000 kilometres (about 9,500 miles) without re-fuelling, heading west over the Pacific.\n\nNo other airline has ever achieved the feat, which Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has called the \u201cfinal frontier in aviation\u201d.\n\nScientists from two Australian universities will be on board to monitor passengers\u2019 sleep patterns, melatonin levels, and food consumption.\n\nPilots will also wear a device that tracks their brain waves and alertness.\n\nWith a 15-hour time difference between New York and Sydney, the impact of jetlag will be closely watched.\n\n\u201cWe know from the basic science of circadian rhythms that a bigger time difference between departure and arrival locations, and travelling east rather than west, tends to mean people feel more jetlag,\u201d University of Sydney professor Stephen Simpson told AFP.\n\n\u201cBut people seem to be wildly different when it comes to the experience of jetlag -\u2013 and we need more research on what contributes to jetlag and travel fatigue, so we can try and reduce the impact of long-haul flights.\u201d\n\nQantas last year introduced the first direct service from the western Australian city of Perth to London, with the 17-hour journey one of the longest passenger flights in the world.\n\nAs well as the New York-Sydney route, Qantas will test a service from London to Sydney in the coming months.\n\nThe airline is considering launching commercial services on the marathon routes \u2014 if the economics stack up.\n\nA decision will be made on the validity of the flights at the end of the year. Joyce has said it is \u201cultimately a business decision\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Pilots concerned \u2013\n\nAnother hurdle could come from within the organisation.\n\nQantas pilots have raised concerns about the impact of ultra long-range flying on safety standards.\n\nThe Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA), which represents Qantas pilots, said the exploratory flights \u201cwill produce a limited set of data that will not adequately replicate real-world flying conditions\u201d.\n\nAIPA safety director Shane Loney has called for a \u201cscientific long-term study\u201d into the impacts on crew.\n\n\u201cPilots are concerned about being able to get enough quality rest during ultra long-range flights to maintain peak performance and we believe significant caution should be exercised in the initial operations to make sure there are no unintended consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nA Qantas spokesperson said the test flights are \u201cjust one part of the work we are doing to assess how to the operate these flights safely\u201d.\n\nBoth Airbus and Boeing have pitched aircraft for the Qantas ultra long-haul routes. Joyce has said it is not a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d which company will be chosen.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 A plane and its passengers are set to test the mental and physical limits of long-haul aviation when Qantas operates the first direct", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/fc0d5e_air-travel-involves-lot-sitting-but-test-flight-new-york-sydney-top-out-whopping-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
