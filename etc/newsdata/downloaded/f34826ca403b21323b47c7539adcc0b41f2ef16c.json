We're building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works.\" \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/tVgO95VIdW \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 23, 2019\n\nIf Trump is building a wall on Colorado\u2019s southern border with New Mexico, that\u2019s news to the governors of both states, who were unaware of any such structure.\n\n\u201cWell this is awkward ... Colorado doesn\u2019t border Mexico,\u201d tweeted that state\u2019s governor, Democrat Jared Polis, soon after Trump\u2019s claim. \u201cGood thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham\u2019s press secretary Nora Sackett was less amused.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me if he really did forget about a state that he lost by such a significant margin, especially when that seems to be the only thing of importance to him and given that he can expect more of the same in 2020,\u201d Sackett told HuffPost in an email. \u201cNo one wants his wall, whether it\u2019s on the Mexican border, the Colorado border, or the Canadian border.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up statement, a different member of Lujan Grisham\u2019s press office emphasized: \u201cYes, we are a state.\u201d\n\nNo wall here.

To that end, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) has provided a preview of what we should expect from the Oval Office in the near future:\n\nLove HuffPost?
