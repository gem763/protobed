Powell is a \u201cbonehead,\u201d \u201ca terrible communicator\u201d possessing a \u201chorrendous lack of vision,\u201d among other Trump characterizations.\n\nAfter an academic study suggested those tweets had some impact on the Fed, Goldman Sachs did its own analysis. It looked at futures prices right before a tweet and compared them to prices 30 minutes after.\n\nThose tweets, the Goldman Sachs analysts found, did not move the market in a statistically significant manner.\n\nBut that\u2019s not to say the tweeter in chief\u2019s missives had no impact.\n\nGoldman Sachs also looked at Trump\u2019s trade-related tweets, and those did make an impact. Those tweets are statistically significant, moving futures by as much as 14 basis points.\n\n\u201cThere are many tweets that garner little reaction, but there are also quite a few trade policy tweets that lead to sizable swings. This is intuitive, as there are clear channels through which tariff escalation can lead to a dimmer economic outlook,\u201d the analysts found.\n\nShort-term bond yields have plunged in reaction to the deteriorating U.S. and global economic outlook. The yield on the 2-year Treasury TMUBMUSD02Y, -1.10% fell Monday to its fourth-lowest level of the year, to 1.466%, from as high as 2.969% in November.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.19% has dropped to 1.55% from 3.23% in November.", "description": "Trump\u2019s tweets about Jerome Powell did not move the market in a statistically significant manner.", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GB254_18trum_ZG_20180107192644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
