Now He\u2019s a Star (With Braces).", "language": "en", "text": "Lil Tecca was 16, unsigned and living with his parents on Long Island when he spotted the Twitter post that changed his life.\n\nThe teenage rapper, now 17, had been releasing songs on the streaming platform SoundCloud from his bedroom for about a year, using free instrumentals from YouTube as beats. But recording in a studio with a real producer still seemed like a luxury.\n\nSo when Taz Taylor, the founder of a young Los Angeles-based music collective known as Internet Money, sent a tweet saying they should work together, Lil Tecca knew he had to find his way to California. Internet Money\u2019s producers, who also started out in their childhood bedrooms, selling beats for cheap online, had gone on to become a crucial element in the rise of platinum-selling rappers like Juice WRLD, XXXTentacion and Trippie Redd, all of whom exploded from SoundCloud.\n\nIn a matter of days, Lil Tecca had explained the distinctly 21st century scenario to his mother and father, gotten their signoff and booked a flight with his manager, Giuseppe Zappala, to record with Taylor in person. After just a few hours in the studio, Lil Tecca had created a handful of songs that would help him break through. Though the track may not have stood out in the moment, \u201cRansom,\u201d a barely two-minute melodic burst of dancehall-inflected rap inspired by artists like Speaker Knockerz and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, would become his instant smash.", "description": "He was only 16 when an out-of-the-blue tweet led to the recording session that yielded his breakthrough hit, \u201cRansom.\u201d See how the internet stars aligned to make Lil Tecca a new king of streaming.", "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/arts/music/doas-tecca-promo/GettyImages-1165612474-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
