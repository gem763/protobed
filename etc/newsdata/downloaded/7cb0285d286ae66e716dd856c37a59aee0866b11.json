He also was pleased to see his friends general manager Erik Neander and manager Kevin Cash achieve the success they have this season.\n\n\"Of course, for Kevin Cash,\" said Montoyo, when asked who is he was happy for in the opposing dugout. \"He's my friend. I know how tough his job is. He's grinding it out and good for him.\"\n\nCash is a former Blue Jays catcher. He signed with the Blue Jays as an undrafted free agent and spent parts of three seasons (2002-04) in Toronto as primarily a backup and defensive replacement.\n\n\"This organization has created a very winning culture, and there's been a little bit of a drought,\" Cash said after the champagne celebration. \"We get to hang another banner, we want to hang some more. Really happy to be a part of it.\"\n\n'Sucks to watch'\n\nBlue Jays second baseman Cavan Biggio watched from the home dugout as the Rays danced in celebration behind the pitcher's mound.\n\n\"Just watching them celebrate on the field \u2014 it sucks to watch \u2014 but a team like that with that calibre of talent to be able to grind out in this type of division, good for them,\" Biggio said. \"It was cool to watch.\n\n\"But that's something we want to be doing in a couple of years.\"\n\nMontoyo remarked the key to the Rays success had been excellent pitching and defence this year, and starter Tyler Glasnow fit the bill on Friday.\n\nComing off a lengthy stint on the injured list with a right forearm strain, he continued to make progress in his comeback bid with 4 1/3 innings of a hitless outing. It was his fourth start since his injury. He struck out four and retired the final eight batters he faced in his 66-pitch outing.\n\nTommy Pham put the Rays in front 2-0 with his 21st homer. Joey Wendle led off the third inning with a single to right field. Pham then crushed the first pitch from Toronto starter T.J. Zeuch (1-2) over the Blue Jays bullpen in left field.\n\nThe Rays increased their lead to 3-0 in the fourth inning. Nate Lowe led off with a walk and advanced to second on Avisail Garcia's slow ground-ball out to third base. Willy Adames cashed in Lowe with a single to centre field.\n\nZeuch lasted five innings and was responsible for three runs and four hits.\n\nThe Blue Jays didn't get a hit until Glasnow left the game. Outfielder Teoscar Hernandez greeted Tampa Bay reliever Colin Poche with a one-out double down the left-field line.\n\nThe Blue Jays finally busted out for a couple of runs in the seventh inning thanks to Hernandez's two-run shot to right field with McGuire aboard. The homer was Hernandez's 24th in 2019.\n\nAustin Meadows added another run with a solo blast, his 33rd, to lead off the ninth.", "description": "An excellent outing from Tommy Pham helped the Tampa Bay Rays clinch an American League wild-card berth with a 6-2 win against the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5301275.1569637794!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tampa-bay-rays.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
