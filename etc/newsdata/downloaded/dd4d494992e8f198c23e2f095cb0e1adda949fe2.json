At the time, the child did not need surgery.\n\nThe same nurse who put the newborn in the incubator is seen rushing back in a panic to pick up her up.\n\nHospital security cameras recorded the horrific moment Roberta Machado plummeted from the medical apparatus in Belem, Brazil\n\nMoments before, a nurse had placed the child inside the incubator and locked one side but apparently failed to secure the other\n\nBaby Roberta is handed to another medical professional and there is a flurry of activity as the ICU team react with fright to the situation.\n\nThe nursing technician holding the child rubs her injured head and lifts her up, moving her around in various positions as if visibly checking her condition.\n\nThe family complained that more should have been done immediately to assess the welfare of their daughter.\n\nIt was nearly an hour before the child was transferred for scans to assess her injuries.\n\nThe incident happened in May this year at the Maternity and Child Health private hospital in Belem, north Brazil, but images were only released on Sunday after her parents, Jessica and Roberto, got a court order forcing the hospital to hand over the security video.\n\nBaby Roberta is handed to another medical professional and there is a flurry of activity as the ICU team react with fright to the situation\n\nMrs Machado had already left for lunch with her husband when the accident happened around 2.30pm.\n\nTen minutes after the near tragic incident, the first-time mother returned to ICU and noticed her child was 'limp and wet'.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian Record TV, she said: 'They didn't want to let me in at first. And when I entered the ICU I saw that everyone was acting differently towards me.\n\n'When I saw my child I was totally bewildered because I couldn't understand what had happened to her. She was very soft, limp and wet.'\n\nMrs Machado said: 'I became desperate and I cried: ''For God's sake what happened to my daughter''\n\nAccording to the young mother when she questioned her child's condition the nursing technician allegedly answered: 'Mum, I've just bathed her and now I'm putting her to sleep.'\n\nDespite the nurse's excuse, Mrs Machado said she quickly noticed a bruise on the back of her child's head.\n\nShe recalled: 'I became desperate and I cried: ''For God's sake what happened to my daughter''.'\n\nBut the technician seemed to brush off her concerns and claimed that 'nothing had happened'.\n\nEven when the mum approached the nurse who was reportedly responsible for the accident, she was told that 'no one saw anything'.\n\nA report from the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IML) concluded that the girl suffered a fracture to the skull and bruising to the scalp. The child fell from a height of 1.4km and the impact of the fall was around six times the weight of the baby\n\nIt was left to another mother, who was in the unit at the time of the accident, to reveal what happened.\n\nMrs Machado said: 'Someone pulled me aside and said, ''look your daughter fell head first onto the floor when the door of the incubator opened. Get your husband immediately''.\n\n'I felt hurt and angry that the doctors who were meant to care for my child had allegedly let this happen while on their watch and appeared to be lying about it.'\n\nA report from the Institute of Forensic Medicine (IML) concluded that the girl suffered a fracture to the skull and bruising to the scalp.\n\nThe child fell from a height of 1.4m and the impact of the fall was around six times the weight of the baby.\n\nIn a statement to police, the nursing technician said she locked the incubator but didn't reveal what had happened to the mother because, according to protocol, the doctor on duty was responsible for doing this.\n\nThe paediatrician present on the day has denied lying to the parents.\n\nRoberta's father said: 'Today, thank God, Roberta is progressing well. She suffered a lot in her early life and we consider her a real fighter'\n\nDespite the tremendous fright, Roberta, now eight months old, is a happy and healthy child and developing normally.\n\nMedical follow-ups and tests continue to monitor for any adverse effects of the fall.\n\nIn a statement, the Maternity and Child Health Hospital said that the institution acted with 'total transparency, and that its staff is trained and updated based on the latest medical care techniques.'\n\nIt added: 'All medical and psychological assistance (was) provided until the patient's medical discharge.'\n\nFor Roberta's parents, it appears that the incubator was not closed properly after the baby was placed inside.\n\nRoberta's father said: 'It has two locks and it appears that only one was activated because as soon as my daughter knocked the door, it opened.\n\n'Today, thank God, Roberta is progressing well. She suffered a lot in her early life and we consider her a real fighter,' he added.\n\nThe case is being investigated by police and the medical professionals involved could face charges of bodily injury, omission of help and abandonment of an incapable.\n\nRoberta's family have filed a civil suit seeking compensation from the hospital.", "description": "Shocking footage shows three-month-old Roberta Machado plunging from the incubator in a hospital in Belem, north Brazil.
