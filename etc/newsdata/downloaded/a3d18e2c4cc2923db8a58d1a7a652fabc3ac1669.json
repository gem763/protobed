The defense created turnovers and we didn\u2019t capitalize on most of them.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers (2-2) took a 13-10 lead with a 55-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter. The Texans (2-2) were driving with about four minutes left when Watson was sacked by Vernon Butler, who caused a fumble that was recovered by Eric Reid at the Houston 33.\n\nCarolina pushed the lead to 16-10 when Joey Slye added a 26-yard field goal with 28 seconds left. Houston had a chance for the win, but Watson\u2019s desperation throw as time expired was knocked down in the end zone by Reid.\n\nCoach Bill O\u2019Brien was left searching for answers as to why his offense, which scored 27 points in a win over the Chargers last week, was stifled on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do better \u2026 I don\u2019t really have any answers. I\u2019ve got to go back and watch the film. I have to start like right now.\u201d\n\nAllen was making his third career start and second this season in place of Cam Newton, who is out with a foot injury. Allen lost the ball three times on sacks, but the Texans were only able to get points out of the last one to allow the Panthers to keep it close until their defense came through with the big play late.\n\nWatson threw for 160 yards on a day the Texans had trouble sustaining drives even when given a short field after turnovers.\n\nReceiver Keke Coutee was disappointed that the offense couldn\u2019t cash in on Allen\u2019s mistakes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, because we know the players we have in this locker room \u2026 so there\u2019s no way we should be putting up that (few) points. We should be unstoppable with our offense \u2026 (and) our defense is playing phenomenal, so we\u2019ve just got to make plays.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to get any points out of the first two fumbles by Allen, the Texans got to him again early in the third quarter. Houston trailed 10-3 when J.J. Watt swatted the ball out of Allen\u2019s hand and pounced on it to give the Texans the ball on the 18-yard line. They tied it when Watson dashed into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown with about 8\u00bd minutes left in the quarter.\n\nBrennan Scarlett had a strip sack of Allen on Carolina\u2019s first possession and it was recovered by Bernardrick McKinney. But the Texans couldn\u2019t do much on the ensuing drive, which included two sacks, and had to punt it away.\n\nThe Texans got left tackle Laremy Tunsil in a trade with Miami just before the season in an attempt to better protect Watson after he was taken down an NFL-high 62 times last season. So far there doesn\u2019t seem to be much improvement as Watson was sacked six times on Sunday and has been taken down 18 times this season.\n\n\u201cEvery offensive line doesn\u2019t want to see their quarterback get sacked, that\u2019s just simple,\u201d Tunsil said. \u201cNobody wants to see their quarterback get sacked six times so we\u2019ve just got to get better.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers took a 3-0 lead on a 48-yard field goal with about 2\u00bd minutes left in the first quarter.\n\nHouston got its running game going on the next drive with a 25-yard run by Carlos Hyde followed by a 40-yard gain by Duke Johnson on the next play. The drive stalled after that and the Texans settled for a 37-yard field goal to tie it with about eight minutes left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Texans forced another fumble by Allen later in the second quarter on a sack by Whitney Mercilus which was recovered by Carlos Watkins. Houston was unable to capitalize on that mistake when DeAndre Hopkins threw an interception on a trick play.\n\nWatson said that their film work made them think that the cornerback would follow the tight end on that play to leave it open for Hopkins to complete the pass. When Watson saw that the cornerback didn\u2019t do what they thought he\u2019d do he tried to get Hopkins\u2019 attention but it was too late.\n\n\u201cSo give them credit for staying disciplined and not running with it,\u201d Watson said.\n\nThe Panthers took advantage of that mistake five plays later when Christian McCaffrey ran 3 yards for a touchdown to make it 10-3 with about a minute left in the first half.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Houston's defense harassed Carolina's Kyle Allen into fumbling three times on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/29/panthers_texans_football_47393_c0-172-4107-2566_s1770x1032.jpg?0b8ae33273d3f9e37b32cdc4f56135f51b40fc48", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
