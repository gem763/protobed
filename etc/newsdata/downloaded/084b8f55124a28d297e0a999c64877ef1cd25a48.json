Bolton, as their positions on major foreign policy issues clashed, most recently on pursuing a peace plan with the Taliban.\n\nThe two men have regularly been at odds over how to take on major foreign policy challenges facing the United States. Mr. Bolton, a longtime national security hawk, held some views that contrasted with Mr. Trump\u2019s, favoring sanctions and pre-emptive military action against some countries even as the president pursued diplomacy.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the two men also disagreed on the circumstances of Mr. Bolton\u2019s ouster.\n\nIn a midday Twitter post, just 90 minutes before Mr. Bolton was scheduled to join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for a briefing for reporters, Mr. Trump wrote that, on Monday night, he asked Mr. Bolton to submit his resignation and that Mr. Bolton complied Tuesday morning. But responding to a question from The New York Times via text, Mr. Bolton said he had offered Mr. Trump his resignation \u201clast night without his asking,\u201d and submitted it in the morning.\n\nHere are five countries that prompted policy disagreements between Mr. Trump, who has been reluctant to expand military America\u2019s footprint abroad, and Mr. Bolton during his 17 months in the post.", "description": "John R.
