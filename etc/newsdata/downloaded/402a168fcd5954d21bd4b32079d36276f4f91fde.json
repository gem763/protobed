(Photo: David Livingston, Getty Images)\n\nShay Mitchell has been documenting her entire pregnancy journey \u2013 and it continued when she took us inside the hospital room while she labored and delivered her first child.\n\nThe \"Pretty Little Liars\" star announced the arrival of the baby girl she shares with boyfriend Matte Babel on Sunday. We still don't have details of the baby's name, but we now know Mitchell was in labor for 33 hours to meet her little bundle.\n\nIn a new video posted to her YouTube series \"Almost Ready,\" the clip follows the couple through the highs and lows, heartwarming and sometimes funny moments of childbirth.\n\nIt opens with Mitchell discovering that her water as broken.\n\nLuckily, she is rocking diapers, which she had previously shared she had succumbed to in pregnancy.\n\nShe heads for the hospital and in the car she admits she is in a lot of pain and is concerned because she hasn't felt the baby move much.\n\n\"The last time I was in pain like this was not a good experience,\" Mitchell shares. The actress had previously opened up about suffering a miscarriage at 14 weeks.\n\nOnce at the hospital, the doctor reveals that she is still in early labor and it is going to be awhile.\n\n\"I don't know how people do this for 36, 40 hours,\" Mitchell says, while telling Matte a friend of hers labored for 40 hours. \"Some people do 72 hours like, how?\"\n\nIn a more humorous scene, Mitchell turns the camera on Babel who, like most partners in this situation, has eaten all the snacks.\n\n\"There were three sandwiches in there, but I find out I'm not allowed to eat, which sucks. I would've jammed them down before I realized I could only have clear foods,\" she says.\n\nIt's at this point that the doctor recommends that Mitchell start Pitocin, a medication that induces or helps speed up labor.\n\n\"The Pitocin labor is pretty rough,\" Mitchell's doula shares. A doula is a professional that provides emotional and physical support during a pregnancy all the way through childbirth and postpartum. Many celebrities have used one.\n\nThe doula advises Babel to get some rest because \"(expletive) is gonna get real in here.\"\n\nAfter many more hours of labor, Mitchell opts for an epidural, something the couple had previously disagreed on.\n\nBut, today, Babel is putting his thoughts aside and wears a T-shirt that reads \"No ovaries, no opinion.\"\n\nFinally, it is time for Mitchell to push. The screen goes dark but you can still hear the voices in the hospital room.\n\n\"She's out. I can't. Oh it's so crazy. Oh god. Oh it's so crazy,\" Mitchell says through tears and then we hear cries from the baby.\n\n\"This is definitely the most intense experience of my life,\" Mitchell admits at the end of the video. \"Matte and I are parents and I can't believe it. And we thought being pregnant was a journey. I'm realizing we have just begun.\"\n\nBut first, the new mama needs some food.\n\n\"I was 99% excited to meet her and I'm 1% excited to eat something,\" she jokes.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/22/shay-mitchell-details-her-labor-delivery-first-baby-pitocin-doula/4061297002/", "description": "Shay Mitchell and Matte Babel have been sharing their pregnancy journey.
