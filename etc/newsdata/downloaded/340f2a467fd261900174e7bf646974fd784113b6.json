We are going to leave on October 31. We have the means and the ability to do so,\u201d he told Sky News television.\n\n\u2013 EU \u2018fed up\u2019: Raab \u2013\n\nThe government will bring forward this week the domestic legislation needed to implement the divorce deal, with a first vote as soon as Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, it is seeking a new yes-or-no vote on approving the deal on Monday, although this may fall foul of parliamentary procedure.\n\n\u201cIf we get the legislation through then there is no extension. October 31 is within sight,\u201d said Gove.\n\nHe said it was dangerous to assume that the 27 other EU leaders would grant an extension.\n\nMore than three years on from the June 2016 vote to leave the EU, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told BBC television that from his conversations with other EU capitals, \u201cthey are fed up with this now \u2014 and we are fed up with it\u201d.\n\nJohnson\u2019s number two added that he was \u201cconfident\u201d of leaving on October 31.\n\nThe Labour main opposition has lambasted Johnson\u2019s deal as a \u201csell-out\u201d and voted for the delay.\n\nHowever, senior figures hinted Sunday that they could let it go through, subject to amendments including a second referendum pitting a divorce deal against remaining in the bloc after all.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to achieve is that this deal in particular, but any deal, is put up against Remain in a referendum,\u201d the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer told the BBC.\n\n\u201cAnd we will have to see tactically how we get there.\u201d\n\nJohnson \u201cmight even meet the deadline\u201d, finance spokesman John McDonnell told Sky News.\n\n\u2013 Europe mulls response \u2013\n\nBrussels officials pressed on with plans to ratify the divorce deal as European leaders considered Johnson\u2019s delay request.\n\nAmbassadors and senior officials from the other 27 member states met Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe EU is keeping all options open and has therefore initiated the ratification process so that it can be handed over to the European Parliament on Monday,\u201d an EU diplomat told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe EU will probably pursue this strategy until there is clarity on the British side,\u201d he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nTusk will spend a \u201cfew days\u201d canvassing member state leaders, and diplomats said this would mean the British parliament will have to vote on Brexit again before hearing their decision on the October 31 departure.\n\nMPs voted by 322 votes to 306 on Saturday to support former Conservative MP Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment to buy extra time.\n\nLetwin said he would now switch and vote for the deal. Former interior minister Amber Rudd said the same, meaning Johnson is just a few votes short.\n\nThe Brexit date has already been pushed back twice from March 29, to the fury of those who wanted to chart their own course and abandon the European project after nearly 50 years.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 A defiant British government doubled down Sunday, insisting it would leave the European Union in 11 days\u2019 time despite", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/fe140c_defiant-boris-johnson-had-earlier-told-mps-he-not-negotiate-brexit-delay-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
