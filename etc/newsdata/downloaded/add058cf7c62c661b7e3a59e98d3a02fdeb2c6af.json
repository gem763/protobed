But Japan still exports about 1.7 million cars a year to the United States, making up about 10% of U.S. vehicle sales.\n\nWednesday\u2019s deal was met with cautious praise from farm groups and lawmakers, who said they looked forward to a more complete deal.\n\nU.S. Representative Jackie Walorski, an Indiana Republican, said she was \u201cencouraged the deal will mean fewer barriers to digital trade and more certainty that costly auto tariffs will not threaten American jobs or raise prices for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-Japan talks, launched a year ago, hit a snag earlier this week as Japan had sought last-minute assurances that Trump would not impose the Section 232 tariffs.\n\nThe USTR characterized the agreement signed by Trump and Abe as \u201cearly achievements\u201d from their negotiations on market access for agriculture, industrial goods and digital trade.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during a signing ceremony on the sidelines of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City, New York, U.S., September 25, 2019.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe digital trade agreement largely follows the U.S. model of internet development, prohibiting taxes on cross-border digital downloads and rules requiring so-called data localization - the storing of data on devices physically present within a country\u2019s borders, the USTR said.\n\nThe deal also limits the ability of the governments to demand source code from digital services providers for security or safety purposes, which the United States says China widely practices.\n\nAbe said the digital trade agreement would establish high-level rules in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe agreement is important for Japan and the United States\u201d in terms of their leading the world in making rules for digital commerce, he added.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed a limited trade deal on Wednesday that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products while further staving off the threat of higher U.S. car duties.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433945166&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1ON", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
