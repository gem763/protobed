We must stop Brexit. There is no Brexit that will be good for our country.\"\n\nShe criticised Mr Johnson for withdrawing the Conservative whip from 21 Tory rebels - including one, Sam Gyimah, who later joined the Lib Dems - and for deciding to suspend Parliament.\n\nShe said he was \"silencing critics, purging opponents, ignoring the law\".\n\n\"For someone who proclaims to hate socialist dictators, he's doing a pretty good impression of one.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jo Swinson criticises Corbyn and Johnson\n\nMs Swinson also turned her fire on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, accusing him of holding on to Eurosceptic views.\n\n\"Even now, when faced with all the clear and obvious dangers that Brexit brings, Jeremy Corbyn still insists that if Labour win a general election, they will negotiate their own Brexit deal to take us out of the EU,\" she said.\n\n\"Nigel Farage might be Brexit by name, but it is very clear that Jeremy Corbyn is Brexit by nature.\"\n\nEarlier, shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti described the Lib Dem's promise to revoke Article 50 without a further referendum as \"illiberal and anti-democratic\".\n\nTurning to Scotland, Ms Swinson highlighted its support to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and urged supporters there to give \"a big vote\" to her party.\n\n\"Together we can stop Brexit,\" she said. \"We are building a movement across the United Kingdom that is on the verge of stopping it.\"\n\n'No Planet B'\n\nIn her keynote speech, Ms Swinson also touched on policy matters away from Brexit.\n\nOn climate change, she said a Lib Dem government would create a green investment bank and set up a citizens' assembly to debate how the UK would reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2045.\n\nShe said her government would tackle climate change \"because, as the placards say, there is no Planet B.\"\n\nMs Swinson also said she wanted the party to \"fundamentally rethink the purpose of our economy\", asking why a country's success was \"reduced to a GDP figure\".\n\n\"It [GDP] measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile,\" she said quoting the American politician Bobby Kennedy.\n\nShe pledged to introduce a wellbeing budget \"to spell out our priorities for public spending on the things that matter most\".\n\nThe Lib Dem leader also promised to fund youth services in order to tackle knife crime and to ringfence funding for mental health services.", "description": "Jo Swinson vows to \"take on\" Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage - and says she can be PM.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nlsg1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
