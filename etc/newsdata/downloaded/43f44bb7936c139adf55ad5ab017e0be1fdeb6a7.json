The deal could provide some badly needed relief to U.S. farmers who have been hit hard by Trump\u2019s trade fight with China.\n\n\u201cUnder the market access agreement, we are announcing today that Japan will open new markets to approximately $7 billion in American agricultural products.\u201d Trump said alongside Abe in New York.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory for America's farmers, ranchers, and growers. That's very important to me,\u201d he added.\n\nThe U.S. agreed to cut its duties on Japanese imports of turbines, machine tools, bicycles, green tea, flowers and other goods.\n\nSign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The official said the U.S.-Japan agreement offers the same access as the 11-nation pact for more than 80 percent of dairy products.\n\nThe International Dairy Foods Association hailed the deal as \u201ca step in the right direction,\u201d despite indications that it \u201cdoes not fully achieve the same tariff rate reductions\u201d as the original TPP or a separate agreement between Japan and the EU. But the group noted that tariff cuts similar to what was in TPP would apply to cheese and whey, which are two of the U.S.\u2019 main dairy exports to Japan.\n\nJapan was motivated to pursue a deal with the U.S. to escape Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on imports of automobiles and auto parts for national security reasons.\n\nTokyo had sought language that would provide a clear exemption from the tariff threat. Talks hit a temporary snag when Japan pushed the U.S. to agree to a provision that would allow Tokyo to reimpose agriculture tariffs and back out of the agreement Trump followed through with the auto threat.\n\nA joint statement signed by the leaders states that the agreement will be implemented on \u201cmutual trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile faithfully implementing these agreements, both nations will refrain from taking measures against the spirit of these agreements and this Joint Statement,\u201d it said.\n\nTokyo interprets that sentence, along with Trump\u2019s remarks made in the meeting with Abe, as enough assurance that the U.S. won\u2019t pursue auto tariffs as long as the agreement is \u201cfaithfully implemented,\u201d a Japanese official said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it is certainly not our intention, the president\u2019s intention, to do anything on autos, on 232s, on Japan,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters, referring to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which is the legislative authority the administration used to justify possible tariffs on autos in the name of national security.\n\nThe agreement won\u2019t need congressional approval and can go into effect as soon as it is ratified by Japan\u2019s legislature. The senior administration official said the goal is to implement the agreement by Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Talks with China are creeping along with no substantive agreement in sight and efforts to get a NAFTA replacement deal passed in Congress could fall victim to politics related to an impeachment inquiry from House Democrats.\n\nAccording to a U.S. fact sheet, Japan will reduce tariffs on beef and pork; provide a country-specific import quota for wheat and wheat products; and immediately eliminate tariffs on almonds, walnuts, blueberries, cranberries, sweet corn, grain sorghum, broccoli and other U.S. farm goods.\n\nJapan will provide a \u201cstaged tariff elimination\u201d on imports of U.S. cheeses, processed pork, poultry, beef offal, ethanol, wine, frozen potatoes, oranges, fresh cherries, egg products and tomato paste, the fact sheet said.\n\nFor fresh and frozen beef and pork, the official said tariffs will be reduced, but won't go to zero, depending on the specific products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all, same as it was in TPP,\u201d the official said. \u201cFor beef, some of it is in five years; for fresh and frozen beef, it\u2019s over 15 years. For pork, some of it is immediate, some of it\u2019s in five years. On muscle cuts on pork, it\u2019s nine years.\u201d\n\nThe digital trade provisions will prohibit customs duties on digitally transmitted videos, music, software and other products. It would also prohibit barriers to cross-border data flows and prevent data localization requirements, the U.S. said in the fact sheet.\n\nRyan McCrimmon contributed to this report from Washington, D.C.\n\n", "description": "President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe announced the agreement on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.", "authors": ["Adam Behsudi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/33/4a/d8db8dc54926986e310288d548d7/20190925-abe-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
