REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nAlthough some media reports suggested both sides are considering an \u201cinterim\u201d deal that would suspend the planned further U.S. tariffs in exchange for additional purchases of American farm products, Trump has repeatedly dismissed this idea, insisting he wants a \u201cbig deal\u201d with Beijing that addresses core intellectual property issues.\n\nThe U.S. Agriculture Department said on Thursday that private exporters reported a snap sale of 398,000 tonnes of soybeans to China, part of a flurry of purchases the top buyer of the oilseed has made since granting waivers to some importers to buy U.S. soy exempt from tariffs as a goodwill gesture.\n\nChinese firms have bought more than 3.5 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans since the beginning of September. Soybeans, the most valuable U.S. agricultural export, have been among the products hardest hit by China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.\n\nLOWERED EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies\u2019 access to largely closed Chinese markets.\n\nBut Chinese officials, surprised by the U.S. blacklisting of Chinese companies, including video surveillance gear maker Hikvision, along with the suspension of U.S. visas for some Chinese officials, told Reuters that Beijing had lowered expectations for significant progress from the talks.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen China respond with concessions to someone throwing down the gauntlet in this manner,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIt suggests to me that the U.S. may have determined that progress was impossible, so everyone is just going through the motions.\u201d\n\nOther flashpoints that have cropped up in recent days include China\u2019s swift action to cut corporate ties to the National Basketball Association over a team official\u2019s tweet in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in Sydney on Thursday that the tariffs were working, forcing Beijing to pay attention to American concerns about its trade practices.\n\n\u201cWe do not love tariffs - in fact we would prefer not to use them - but after years of discussions and no action, tariffs are finally forcing China to pay attention to our concerns,\u201d Ross said in remarks prepared for delivery on an official visit to Australia.", "description": "Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators met on Thursday for the first time since late July to try to find a way out of a 15-month trade war as new irritants between the world's two largest economies threatened hopes for progress.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439276300&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991AI", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
