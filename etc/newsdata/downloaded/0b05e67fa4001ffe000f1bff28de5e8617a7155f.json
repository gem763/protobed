We would be told audacious lies about how taking out al-Baghdadi would only make things worse, only proves Trump\u2019s Syria policy is a disaster, how this successful mission happened in spite of Trump, and that Trump\u2019s perfectly-calibrated statement and willingness to answer the media\u2019s questions at length would be twisted into a crass victory lap.\n\nBut even I, your humble writer, was floored when the Washington Post lamented the loss of that dear, sweet man al-Baghdadi \u2014 a vile terrorist responsible for thousands of innocent deaths, a monster who engaged in serial rape, and a sub-human, barbaric sociopath whose entire legacy is one of torture, murder, rape, tyranny and terror \u2014 including of his own people.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing about the establishment media\u2026\n\nEvery time you are certain there is no bottom left to hit, they find another bottom\u2026\n\nThe media\u2019s serial lies about Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown are directly responsible for a horrific race riot that destroyed a predominantly black neighborhood in Ferguson, Missouri. Obviously, the media have learned that was a terrible mistake and \u2014 Wait, did CNN just openly call for rioting in Baltimore?\n\nSince the media were just caught red-handed lying to us for three years about Trump colluding with Russia, surely they won\u2019t \u2014 What\u2019s this about a perfectly anodyne Ukraine call?\n\nAnd, since the media has had to retract all its lies smearing the Covington Catholic High School boys, certainly they\u2019ve learned a\u2013 Did you just say Brett Kavanaugh threw some ice?\n\nBut this\u2026\n\nThis abiding affection from the Washington Post for a killer and rapist, a murdering theocrat who used three small children as human shields and murdered them during his cowardly suicide\u2026\n\nAs cynical and clear-eyed as I have been about the media for nearly thirty years, as ahead-of-the-curve I like to believe I have been about BuzzFeed, CNN, and others\u2026 This I did not see coming.\n\nAnd it was not just once that the Post expressed its affection for this barbarian\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s begin with Max Boot, the Post\u2019s morally illiterate columnist, a man so diseased with hate and envy for President Trump, he told the world that using three children as human shields is not the act of a coward:\n\nA president who has never heard a shot fired in anger reveled in Baghdadi\u2019s last moments, even claiming \u201che died like a coward \u2026 whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\u201d \u2026 The assertion that Baghdadi died as a coward was, in any case, contradicted by the fact that rather than be captured, he blew himself up.\n\nUnderstand this\u2026 al-Baghdadi used three small children as human shields and then rather than release those children, he murdered those children while blowing himself up to avoid capture.\n\nIf shielding yourself with small children is not cowardly, then nothing is cowardly. But here is Max Boot of the Washington Post gushing over al-Baghdadi\u2019s heroic act of using small children as shields because the Orange Man is so Bad. Under pressure, Boot was forced to retract that nonsense. Too late. Fuck you, pal.\n\nNonetheless, that was a bottom I never saw coming.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the Washington Post\u2019s Sunday obituary that literally lionizes al-Baghdadi with a headline that is kinder, more generous, and more complimentary than any headline our own president has received from the Post.\n\n\u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State dies at 48.\u201d\n\nOne of the most monstrous human beings in our history, a barbarian who kidnapped, raped, and tortured a young, American woman for more than a year, is described as an \u201caustere religious scholar.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s like describing O.J. Simpson as a \u201cwidower.\u201d\n\nAnd that headline was AFTER the Post\u2019s editors gave it some thought and decided they could do better. It originally read, \u201cIslamic State\u2019s terrorist-in-chief,\u2019 Dies at 48.\u201d\n\nEventually, the uproar forced to the Post to change the headline yet again, but the opening of the obituary still reads like a Horatio Alger story, and still describes a child killer as an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d:\n\nWhen Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took the reins of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, few had heard of the organization or its new leader, then an austere religious scholar with wire-frame glasses and no known aptitude for fighting and killing.\n\nOh, there\u2019s more. We are also told:\n\nMr. Baghdadi maintained a canny pragmatism as leader, melding a fractious mix of radical Islamist militants and former Iraqi Baathists and army officers into a powerful military force capable of overrunning cities and defeating Iraqi divisions in battle.\n\nThe Post has never said anything this complimentary about Trump, who just happens to be the leader responsible for liberating millions of Muslims with his successful approach to wiping out ISIS.\n\nVia the great Ace of Spades, who originally rounded these up, let me show how the Post attacked Trump on the very same day it gushed over a rapist and murderer\u2019s \u201ccanny pragmatism\u201d and bravery:\n\nOpinion: The U.S. kills an ISIS leader. But Trump is giving the group a new lease on life. https://t.co/rg26xpLfiD \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 27, 2019\n\n\u2014\n\nOpinion: Three ways the Baghdadi raid undermines Trump\u2019s chaotic policy https://t.co/LxvVB2twS3 \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 28, 2019\n\n\u2014\n\nTrump\u2019s rollout of the news of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s death contrasted sharply with the Obama White House\u2019s approach in 2011 on the death of Osama bin Laden https://t.co/QbLHEjT1Gu \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 27, 2019\n\n\u2014\n\nDespite the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, some analysts question U.S. ability to prevent ISIS resurgence https://t.co/jfzMgahGhM \u2014 The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) October 28, 2019\n\n\u2014\n\nSo as you can see, killing al-Baghdadi can only mean bad things \u2014 you know, like how Trump and the military just bagged the guy who was all set to take al-Baghdadi\u2019s place.\n\nTrump has successfully led the effort to wipe out ISIS and its leaders, something our terrible Expert Class (like the hideous Max Boot) told us would take decades; it also looks like Trump has solved the 200-year-old border dispute between the Syrian Kurds and Turkey, which means we are avoiding a potentially disastrous war. On top of that, Trump is keeping his promise to put an end to our troops dying in the sand until the end of time.\n\nBut it\u2019s al-Baghdadi who earns all the Post\u2019s kind words and praise, which reveals everything about the vile Post and its demented and perverse hatred for Trump and his supporters.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
