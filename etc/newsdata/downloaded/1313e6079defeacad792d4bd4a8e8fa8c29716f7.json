We had a long debate over whether to start Leigh in the first place and move Liam to the wing.\u201d\n\nSpringbok coach Rassie Erasmus brought S\u2019Bu Nkosi in for Kolbe, one of the stand-out players of this World Cup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big blow because everybody knows his quality and the contribution he makes,\u201d Erasmus said, also quick to point out that Nkosi was no slouch, with eight tries in 10 Tests to his name.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We\u2019ve struggled against Wales\u2019 \u2013\n\nErasmus has transformed South Africa since taking over last year, turning around a terrible set of results and also naming the first black Springbok captain in Siya Kolisi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been under pressure in the last couple of years to redeem ourselves,\u201d he said, with the Boks having lost their pool opener in Japan to New Zealand before hammering Italy to advance as runners-up.\n\n\u201cWe were number five, six, seven in the world since 2015 and had some proper hidings \u2014 some people lost faith in us and we\u2019re trying to get that respect back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a different kind of pressure. People are starting to believe in us again as a team.\u201d\n\nBoth coaches predicted a kicking-heavy game based around forward domination, with Erasmus again naming a replacements\u2019 bench including six huge forwards and two backs.\n\nThat tactic worked well in the quarters as the South Africans effectively outmuscled hosts Japan for a comprehensive 26-3 win.\n\n\u201cLately, we\u2019ve struggled against Wales. They know what they are good at, and focus on that,\u201d Pollard said.\n\n\u201cThey starve you of possession and territory, and enforce their kicking game on you.\n\n\u201cThey take away your set piece. It\u2019s not a game plan or rugby with a lot of flair in it, but it\u2019s suffocating. If you fall into that trap, they will enforce their game plan on you for 80 minutes, and you will probably not win that match.\u201d\n\nThe winners on Sunday face either defending champions New Zealand or England \u2014 who play on Saturday \u2014 in the final on November 2, also in Yokohama.\n\n\u201cWe feel we have as good a chance as the other three teams,\u201d Erasmus said of South Africa, champions in 1995 and 2007.", "description": "Yokohama (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Six Nations champions Wales will be out for revenge in their Rugby World Cup semi-final against Rugby Championship", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/bed19b_wales-players-prepared-game-wet-stadium-in-yokohama-wales-springboks-seek-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
