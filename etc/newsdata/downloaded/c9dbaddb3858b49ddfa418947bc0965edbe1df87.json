I thought \u201cI\u2019ve turned into a bit of a bully here\u201d but I made amends with him and I looked after him, he was my little brother.\u2019\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s penultimate episode, Ella was given her marching orders by demands of The Circle of Trust \u2013 aka Sammie/James, who appeared to many to be getting a little drunk with the power of it all.\n\nBut James insists that he was never worried about winning the show, and he knew that Paddy and Georgina \u2018fully deserved\u2019 to be the final two.\n\nWoody Cook in his apartment at The Circle (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018I gave them advice, you can\u2019t tell people how to rate people, but I gave them advice, and I\u2019d worked out where we would be,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018And it worked, that was all about Paddy and Georgina. I\u2019m not sure what was shown there, but that was a selfless act, but as long as they got to the final, two people that fully deserved it, I didn\u2019t care if I got to the final.\n\nJames Doran, 26, from Liverpool, who played as single mother \u2018Sammie\u2019 (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018So getting to the final was a win/win for me, and I promise you now, from the bottom of my heart I knew I hadn\u2019t won when I stepped into that live show, but winning for me was letting Georgina or Paddy win it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018People who beat the odds, fighters, and it\u2019s not a case that something\u2019s happened and they got over it, they\u2019re going to have to live with that forever and to shine a light on that situation, and give people in that position confidence\u2026 I don\u2019t know the stats, but think about how many people with cerebral palsy are going to feel and uplifted.\n\n\u2018That meant more to me than the \u00a3100,000.\u2019\n\nHe said he hopes to meet the real Sammie, whose identity he took for the show, and said that he doesn\u2019t \u2018think there are any single mums that dislike what I\u2019ve done or disliked me, they understand\u2019.\n\nPaddy Smyth was crowned the winner of The Circle 2019, taking home a huge \u00a370,000, after the remaining contestants\u2019 \u2013 Woody, Tim, Georgina, Sammie/James and Paddy \u2013 voted for who they wanted to see land the cash prize.\n\nA public vote also decided who would win an additional \u00a330,000, with Tim topping the vote and bagging the prize.\n\nSpeaking about winning the show, Paddy said: \u2018I\u2019m in complete shock. Honestly I never thought I\u2019d make it past the first blocking.\n\n\u2018To come in as a late player and come in with such insecurities about myself and to know that Circle accepted me and you guys accepted me, it\u2019s just insane. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d even get here.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can catch The Circle on Channel 4 on demand.\n\nMORE: Danny Cipriani sues Lizzie Cundy\u2019s book publishers after she details alleged sex life in memoir\n\nMORE: Coldplay tease new music and fans can\u2019t wait for \u2018new era\u2019 of the band", "description": "The Circle 2019 saw Paddy Smyth win the show.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lewis", "Tilly Pearce"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90615631_1571495201.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
