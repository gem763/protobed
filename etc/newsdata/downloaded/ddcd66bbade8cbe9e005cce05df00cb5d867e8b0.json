The five countries named are Brazil, France, Germany, Argentina, and Turkey \u2014 some of the world's biggest greenhouse-gas emitters.\n\nThunberg and her peers filed the complaint under the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which stipulates a set of inalienable rights for all children worldwide, including to life, health, and peace. The complaint alleges that accelerating climate change puts those rights at risk.\n\n\"Our homes are being swallowed by the ocean, the places where memories are made,\" 17-year-old plaintiff Carlos Manual, from the Pacific island nation of Palau, said during a press conference announcing the complaint. \"I am standing in front of you because I care about my generation.\"\n\nThe complaint did not include the US and China, which produce the most greenhouse-gas emissions in the world, because those countries haven't signed the section of the treaty that allows children to seek justice for potential violations.\n\nThe youth activists say the climate crisis is a violation of children's rights\n\nSwedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg speaks during the Climate Action Summit at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, New York, September 23, 2019. Carlo Allegri/Reuters\n\nBefore announcing the complaint, Thunberg kicked off the United Nations Climate Action Summit with an impassioned speech to world leaders.\n\n\"This is all wrong. I shouldn't be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,\" she said with tears in her eyes. \"Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\"\n\nThunberg held the room in thrall as she chastised leaders for talking about \"money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth\" while people suffer.\n\n\"You are failing us,\" she said. \"But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.\"\n\nThe 16 youth petitioners behind the complaint come from Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, India, the Marshall Islands, Nigeria, Palau, South Africa, Sweden, Tunisia, and the United States.\n\nYouth petitioners introduce themselves during a press conference, September 23, 2019, at the UNICEF House in New York. Radhika Chalasani/UNICEF\n\nThe petitioners allege that the five named countries have knowingly contributed to the climate crisis, which threatens children's lives with extreme weather, floods, wildfires, sea-level rise, the spread of mosquito-borne disease, and poor air quality.\n\nThe complaint also says climate change threatens indigenous groups and fosters mental health issues among children, including \"climate anxiety and solastalgia \u2014 mourning the destruction of a cherished place.\"\n\nThe petitioners allege that the five named countries are not on track to meet their emissions goals under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. They argue that, by the time that the countries put forward those goals, it was clear their emissions already endangered children's lives.\n\nCatarina Lorenzo Home, 12, from Brazil, speaks at the press conference at UNICEF House in New York, September 23, 2019. Lorenzo Home says that the climate in her hometown has gotten much drier, and she and her family save water in a tank in preparation for the next water shortage. Radhika Chalasani/UNICEF\n\n\"It was clear then that every metric ton of CO2 that they emitted or permitted was adding to a crisis that transcends all national boundaries and threatens the rights of all children everywhere,\" the complaint says.\n\nThe youth petitioners are asking the five countries to change their climate policies.\n\n\"Thirty years ago, world leaders made a historic commitment to the world's children by adopting the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Today, the world's children are holding the world accountable to that commitment,\" Charlotte Petri Gornitzka, UNICEF's deputy executive director, said in a press release. \"We fully support children exercising their rights and taking a stand. Climate change will impact every single one of them. It's no wonder they are uniting to fight back.\"\n\nNow that the complaint has been officially filed, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child \u2014 composed of 18 human-rights experts \u2014 will assess the case. According to protocol, that committee will submit its views and any recommendations to each named country. The countries are then supposed to submit a response within six months.\n\nAlexandria Villase\u00f1or, 14, from New York, speaks at a press conference announcing a collective action being taken on behalf of young people everywhere facing the impacts of the climate crisis on September 23, 2019 at UNICEF House in New York. Radhika Chalasani/UNICEF\n\nOther young people have filed climate lawsuits across the globe\n\nThis UN complaint is the latest in a string of legal actions taken by children in response to the climate crisis.\n\nA group of 21 kids and teenagers sued the US government in 2015, alleging that the government was violating their constitutional rights by contributing to climate change despite knowledge of its dangerous consequences. In that landmark case, known as Juliana v. United States, the plaintiffs say their generation has already suffered and will continue to suffer the consequences of climate change, including health problems, extreme weather, and water shortages.\n\nThose 21 youth plaintiffs range in age from 12 to 23 and hail from 10 states. They aren't asking for financial compensation; instead, they want the court to compel federal agencies to end policies that directly harm the environment (like subsidizing fossil-fuel extraction) and mandate government action that will cut down greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nThe youth plaintiffs in Juliana v. United States after a court hearing in Eugene, Oregon in March 2016. Andrea Willingham/Our Chidren's Trust\n\nThe Obama and Trump administrations both attempted to get the case thrown out numerous times. In the latest attempt, three Ninth Circuit federal judges heard arguments in June; those judges could decide to dismiss the case or allow it to go forward, though it's unclear when they will issue a decision.\n\nOur Children's Trust, the nonprofit behind the Juliana v. United States case, has also supported youth legal actions related to climate across all 50 US states.\n\nJuliana v.

And in 2016, the Supreme Court of Pakistan allowed Rabab Ali, who was 7 years old at the time, to proceed with a public-interest petition alleging that the government violated constitutional rights through its use of fossil fuels.\n\nOther youth-led legal actions are underway in Belgium, Uganda, and the Philippines. Courts in India and Norway have dismissed such cases, though plaintiffs have stated intentions to appeal.\n\nFrench President Macron lashed out at Thunberg\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron attends a news conference at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France December 10, 2017 REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer\n\nIf Thunberg and her peers' legal complaint is successful, it could compel the five named countries to cooperate with other UN member nations to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France, one of the countries named in the complaint, told Europe 1 that Thunberg's stance was \"very radical\" and was likely to \"antagonize societies.\"\n\n\"All the movements of our youth \u2014 or our not-so-young \u2014 are helpful,\" Macron said. \"But they must now focus on those who are furthest away, those who are seeking to block the way.\"\n\nMacron added that he didn't think \"the French government nor the German government, currently, were blocking the way.\"", "description": "Greta Thunberg and 15 other young activists allege that not tackling climate change constitutes a violation of children's rights.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward", "Morgan Mcfall-Johnsen"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d89379c2e22af2ca73af3d6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
