Where should I go?", "language": "en", "text": "Dear MarketWatch,\n\nI live in Loveland, Colorado, just turned 60 and would love to be retired within the next year. I\u2019m looking for a more affordable place to retire and am thinking about Mexico \u2014 somewhere I can live for between $800 and $1,200 a month.\n\nIdeally, I would like a pretty big expat community, but a place that still retains the feel of Mexican culture (Cabo feels like SoCal to me, so nothing like that); somewhere with a decent number of cultural things to do like music and plays; and good food. I\u2019d also like a moderate climate and to be somewhat near the ocean. And I would like the ratio of single men to women to be 10:1 \u2014 I\u2019m kidding!\n\nBest,\n\nMo\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDear Mo,\n\nSadly, there does not appear to be a fitting spot with that coveted 10:1 male to female ratio (but if I find it, I\u2019ll let you know, and we\u2019ll set up our own dating service!), but I do think I\u2019ve found some excellent, affordable places for you to retire in Mexico.\n\nWhile it\u2019s harder to retire on that little money in America, Mexico does have more options. But, these spots come with downsides \u2014 some may have higher crime (the U.S. Department of State gives Mexico a level 2 safety warning noting that you should \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d when visiting and highlights areas to avoid traveling to), and others are extremely hot in the summers. That said, here are some locations that might fit the bill.\n\niStock Beach and waterfront promenade in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico at twilight.\n\nMazatlan: Though there are touristy areas in this Pacific Coast resort town (John Wayne and Gary Cooper used to go marlin fishing here), there\u2019s also plenty to fall in love with, like cobblestone streets, neoclassical and French Baroque architecture and cultural amenities like theater and art galleries. And as The Washington Post recently reported of Mazatlan\u2019s gorgeous historic Centro neighborhood: \u201cTime and again people described the Centro to us as \u2018Mexican with some tourists,\u2019 rather than a tourist town (ahem, Puerto Vallarta) with some Mexicans.\u201d\n\nJanet Blaser, a 63-year-old former journalist who left Santa Cruz for Mazatlan, told MarketWatch that she loves the nature here too, specifically the \u201cbeautiful glittering Pacific Ocean, warm and swimmable.\u201d And it\u2019s inexpensive to live here: Blaser says she lives on about $1,000 a month, and you can learn more about the cost of living there. She adds that though it\u2019s helpful to have a car, many expats get by without one.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that crime is an issue in the area (the Sinola state, in which Mazatlan is located, is on the United States\u2019 \u201cdo not travel\u201d list due to crime, but the U.S. does permit its employees to go to parts of Mazatlan, and Blaser feels safe where she lives). Added perk: Mazatlan\u2019s weather. Though it gets hot in the summer, it\u2019s milder than in Merida (one of my other suggestions below).\n\n\n\niStock The beach in Zihuatanejo, Mexico\n\nZihuatanejo: International Living\u2019s Executive Editor Jennifer Stevens recommends this Pacific Coast beach town for expats \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to see why. For one, it\u2019s gorgeous, as Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler wrote: \u201cThis swath of the state is slammed up against the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains, with cliffs and ravines blanketed by mangrove, oak, and black olive, and tangled with subtropical shrubs, agaves, and snaking vines\u2026Zihua (pronounced \u201czee-wha\u201d), as it\u2019s thankfully shortened to, is especially hemmed in by nature\u2014by the scooped-out bay to the west, with its sliver of silt-fine beach and palm trees, and by hills in every other direction.\u201d\n\nAnd the city itself isn\u2019t too shabby either, with cobblestone streets lined with restaurants, bars and tiny shops, as well as a central market where you can pick up the night\u2019s dinner and artisan goodies in the same trip. All these perks could have made Zihua super touristy but as Lonely Planet writes: \u201cfor the most part, Zihua has retained its historic charm.\u201d (Those are just some of the reasons that \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u2019s\u201d fictional character Andy Dufresne might have dreamed of this spot while he sat in prison for decades.)\n\nPlus, the climate is appealing for most of the year, with temperatures tending to range between the high 60s to the high 80s and low 90s. What\u2019s more, even on a meager salary, you can likely afford Zihua: International Living estimates that a couple can live on about $1,300 a month, and singletons on even less; it also notes that you can get around on public transportation.\n\nHowever, one big downside is that crime is a major issue in this state, as the U.S. State Department has noted.\n\niStock M\u00e9rida in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico.\n\nMerida: You won\u2019t get bored in Merida \u2014 which boasts an abundance of colonial history, \u201cexcellent cuisine,\u201d \u201cthriving markets\u201d and \u201cevents happening just about every night,\u201d Lonely Planet notes of the area, adding: \u201cSince the Spanish conquest, M\u00e9rida has been the cultural capital of the entire Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s not right on the beach, you\u2019re only about 40 minutes from the sugar-sand beaches of the Yucatan\u2019s Gulf Coast, and International Living, which estimates its expat population at about 4,000, named it one of the five best spots in Mexico for U.S. expats. And though tourists do come to Merida, Lonely Planet is quick to point out that it\u2019s \u201ca tourist town too big to feel like a tourist trap.\u201d\n\nHowever, one big downside for you might be the hot and humid summer weather (temperatures can top 100 degrees Fahrenheit in summer, though winter temperatures are often in the mid-60s and 70s). But the low cost of living may help smooth over those downsides: International Living notes that a couple can live on about $1,400 a month here, and singletons on even less thanks to lower rent, food and other costs. You also may be able to get by without a car, but it\u2019s easier with one. So in summer, head back to Colorado for a visit with old friends!", "description": "This yoga teacher is hoping to leave Colorado within the year.
