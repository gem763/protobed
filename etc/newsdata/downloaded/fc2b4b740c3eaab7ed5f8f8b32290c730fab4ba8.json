Its initial asking price was $100 million.\n\n\n\nAfter two years of price cuts, the seven-bedroom spec house vaulted back into view last month with one very noticeable difference\u2014a $20 million price increase.\n\n\n\nThe seller, producer-turned-developer Nile Niami, upped the asking price for the property from $59.9 million to $79.9 million, Mansion Global reported in September. Meanwhile, Los Angeles brokers and developers have faced an oversupply of newly built spec homes with eight-figure price tags.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Mr. Niami\u2019s move made news\u2014and elicited skepticism among some brokers and agents interviewed by Mansion Global who\u2019ve been tracking the luxury home sales slump that\u2019s settled into cities across the world this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething like that is quite extraordinary, and it\u2019s going to get press and attention \u2026 but it\u2019s also going to get a lot of chuckles,\u201d because it smells like a marketing ploy, said Robert Dankner, president of Prime Manhattan Residential, a brokerage firm with a focus on the luxury market.\n\n\n\nMore: Drue Heinz\u2019s Manhattan Townhouse Sells for $13 Million\n\nWhen a property doesn\u2019t sell after a sustained time on the market, there\u2019s either something \u201cinherently wrong\u201d with it\u2014such as being located in a \u201cbad\u201d neighborhood\u2014or it\u2019s priced incorrectly, Mr. Dankner said.\n\n\n\nHowever, for Mr. Niami, it\u2019s less about a marketing ploy and more about smart pricing. He told Mansion Global the Opus price increase can be justified by looking at two recent sales of smaller, vacant land lots next door and across the street from the property, in Los Angeles\u2019s high-end Trousdale Estates neighborhood, which sold for $25.5 million and $30 million, respectively. He anticipates that construction of eight- to nine-figure homes on those lots will raise value throughout the area in the next few years.\n\n\u201cA price of $79 million currently for Opus is not about marketing, it\u2019s about value,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIn the current soft luxury market, and in an environment where buyers are more educated than ever, dramatic price increases \u00e0 la Opus are rare, brokers told Mansion Global. More importantly, they\u2019re difficult to justify, barring a major renovation or some other clear value-add, such as additional square footage\n\n\n\nMore: With Possible U.S. Economic Downturn on the Horizon, It Pays to Take Out a Mortgage\n\nConnie Blankenship, the Los Angeles-based director of luxury estates at Douglas Elliman, said that a mega-price jump, or \u201caspirational pricing,\u201d when luxury market indicators are generally negative is not something she would advise to her clients.\n\n\n\nSuch a tactic is designed to \u201cget people talking about the property again, especially if it's been on the market for an extended period of time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I would say this is a very short-term view and you have a limited window of opportunity to attract a new buyer that's not familiar with the history of the property.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo why, absent a renovation, would any seller or broker worth their salt opt to relist a property for thousands or millions of dollars higher?\n\n\n\nScarcity, Perceived or Actual\n\n\n\nIn the best-case scenario, relisting a property that is truly unique within a limited geographic market with a higher price tag could signal its value\u2014a penthouse with a fantastic terrace in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, for example, doesn\u2019t come along often, according to Gill Chowdhury, an agent with Warburg Realty in New York City. He was the third broker to take on the listing after the home had spent 12 months on the market. The first broker asked $4.5 million and dropped it to $4 million; the second broker started at $3.75 million and dropped it to $3.45 million. Mr. Chowdhury said raised the listing price by $50,000, to $3.5 million, and eventually sold it at $3.3 million.\n\n\n\nHis strategy hinged on highlighting the property\u2019s scarcity in order to \u201cput upward pressure in an otherwise downtrending market,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are signaling to the market that we are here to sell, but that this is not a fire sale, like $3 million would essentially be,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it didn\u2019t trade over the asking price, I got a better number by anchoring in at a higher price. It's really rare that you can do that in this market, but it is possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nTiming is Always Key\n\n\n\nAn important consideration when relisting and considering a price increase is how long the property was on the market and how long it was off the market before the price was raised, Mr. Chowdhury said. Sellers tend to be more successful when the property has been off the market for a while, allowing both the buyer pool and competing listings to naturally refresh.\n\n\n\nOnce a property has been relisted with a higher price, tracking average sales prices in the specific market segment is critical to gauge how long to keep it on the market.\n\n\n\n\u201cGet granular,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said. \u201cIf your higher price is consistent with where you think the market is, and properties are taking seven months to sell, then hold firm. If properties start closing at much lower prices and your target market price has been reset, act immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore: For Foreign House Hunters in London, the Time to Act Is Now\n\nIn Sonoma County, California, timing and scarcity dovetailed this fall as Climb Real Estate founder Chris Lim relisted what he described as a modern, architecturally significant home built into a hillside. The property served as a weekend retreat for a Bay Area entrepreneur. Two years ago, when Mr. Lim was preparing to list the home for the first time for $7.95 million, Northern California was engulfed in a series of deadly wildfires, putting many real estate transactions on hold. The house survived the fires, and eventually a new broker took over and tried to sell it for $6.5 million, to no avail.\n\n\n\nMr. Lim now holds the listing again and is attempting to sell it off-market for $8 million\u2014a hair higher than its original price, but $1.5 million higher than its last price. The highly desirable wine country market now counts fewer homes of this ilk, he said, and that could give him an edge.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe believe that to be able to duplicate a home of this magnitude and the cost, given Bay Area costs\u2014land costs, labor costs, construction costs\u2014we believe that the price tag of $8 million is warranted, and we believe it's a narrow buyer pool,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nUnhurried, Ego-Driven Sellers and Buyers\n\n\n\nWhen inventory is everywhere, like it is now, buyers are in control and can afford to be picky decision-makers. But in the upper echelons of the market, some wealthy sellers may list a beloved family estate or meticulously designed vacation home and refuse to budge on price, regardless of what\u2019s happening on the ground or in the data.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are sellers who don\u2019t need to sell and their position is, \u2018If you want the property, this is my price,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said. Such was the case with a Hamptons, New York, home owned by a well-known builder who rented it out to celebrities, he said.\n\n\n\n\"I think he was asking around $49 million and even [with an offer of] $45 million, he turned the buyer down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCody Vichinsky, co-founder of Bespoke Real Estate, a New York-based firm that focuses on properties priced $10 million and up, said a fundamental part of his job is understanding the hyper-local nuances that drive demand in a \u201cmicro market\u201d like the Hamptons, where the firm sells vacation properties.\n\n\n\nA measured price increase when relisting a home in the ultra-luxe market can sometimes prove fruitful, he said, because desire\u2014not necessity\u2014is driving demand for both sellers and buyers in this category.\n\n\n\n\u201cSellers oftentimes romanticize what they have,\u201d Mr. Vichinsky said. \u201cThey just believe it\u2019s worth more than it is, and they don\u2019t care. You will see, if they\u2019re not getting traction, they may feel that it\u2019s not expensive enough. And there are plenty of buyers in the planet, believe it or not, who buy based on price more than anything else.\u201d\n\n\n\nThese kinds of buyer and seller attitudes aren\u2019t isolated to New York or the United States, he added, but he does see it happening less domestically and more so in international markets.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of it is ego-driven, a lot of it is [their] capability to have what they perceive to be the best, and that\u2019s a very rarified asset class and buyer class, but it does exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with properties that are eight-figure plus \u2026 value is derived by what someone is willing to pay for something, and what someone is willing to sell for something.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom Penta Christie\u2019s to Offer \u2018Five Nudes\u2019 by Sanyu for HK$250 Million\n\nFor serious sellers, the decision to raise a listing price should always be made with integrity. If not, they risk burning money and time on the market.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's important to be honest with yourself, and if you're an agent, to be honest with the client. If the property is worth substantially less, you cannot list at a higher price if you're a serious seller,\u201d Mr. Chowdhury said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Mareesa Nicosia"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117671?size=1.6&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
