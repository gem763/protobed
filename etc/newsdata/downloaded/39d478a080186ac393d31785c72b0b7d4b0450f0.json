REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo\n\nBenjamin Ndimila, the Chief Executive Officer of Tanzania Government Flight Agency (TGFA), told Reuters that under the contract Airbus would supply two A220-300 aircraft.\n\nPresident John Magufuli has been personally championing the revival of Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL), joining other regional governments that are launching or revamping national carriers to share in Africa\u2019s growing aviation business.\n\nLast month, neighbouring Uganda also relaunched its national carrier.\n\nTGFA, under the president\u2019s office, leases aircraft to Air Tanzania.\n\nAir Tanzania\u2019s existing fleet includes one Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, two Airbus A220-300 jets and three DHC Dash 8-400 aircraft, formerly known as the Bombardier Q400 turboprop.\n\nNdimila said the new Airbus planes would have a more luxurious interior than in the existing aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe new planes will have an improved entertainment system including screens in each seat,\u201d he said.\n\nAirbus, he said, had told Tanzania the planes would be ready in about a year. He declined to say how much they would cost.\n\nMagufuli\u2019s government reckons a more efficient national airline will help tourism, a mainstay of Tanzania\u2019s economy.\n\nOn Monday, he said the airline carried 75% of domestic air traffic, up from 3% three years ago.\n\n\u201cSo far the business is doing very well. We are overwhelmed by the demand ... we wish these planes could be delivered even tomorrow,\u201d Ndimila said.", "description": "Tanzania has signed a contract with Airbus for the European planemaker to supply two passenger jets for the country's national airline to help expand its small fleet and extend its network of destinations, a government official said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432012850&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1E4-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
