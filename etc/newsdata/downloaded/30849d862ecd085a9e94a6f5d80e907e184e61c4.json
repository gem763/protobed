What was it like?\n\nSHERYL: I was in the bowels of the Capitol complex, where a few dozen Republicans had come down en masse to a podium to denounce the Democrats\u2019 inquiry as a Soviet-style process. Then, all of a sudden, they just turned around, their backs to us, and stormed this secure office suite where their colleagues were preparing to interview another witness. They marched forward, shouting, some holding their cellphones up \u2014 a breach of policy in this classified area \u2014 as they barged past the closed doors.\n\nSoon after, Republicans and Democrats started coming out and giving us these very similar accounts, basically describing a sit-in \u2014 although some were actually standing. The sergeant-at-arms, the chief law enforcement officer in the Capitol, showed up. It was wild.\n\nCarl, it was much calmer on the Senate side, where we heard a different take from a top Republican: The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune, was asked about Bill Taylor\u2019s explosive testimony and said, \u201cThe picture coming out of it, based on the reporting we\u2019ve seen, is \u2014 yeah, I would say is not a good one.\u201d\n\nCARL: Mr. Thune\u2019s comments show you that there\u2019s at least a certain segment of Senate Republicans alarmed by this. He\u2019s an independent guy. But the caucus is divided, and without a cohesive strategy. You have some senators who won\u2019t break with President Trump no matter what, some who are keeping an eye on it, and then some embattled 2020 incumbents who have to play it safe. Mitch McConnell wants to let the senators do their own thing.", "description": "After a number of days dominated by the findings of the Democratic-led investigation, Wednesday brought an unconventional Republican response.", "authors": ["Noah Weiland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/us/politics/23dc-impeachbriefing3/23dc-impeachbriefing3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
