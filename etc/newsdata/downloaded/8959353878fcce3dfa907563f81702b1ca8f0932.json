The e-commerce giant says it is ordering 100,000 electric delivery trucks, the WSJ\u2019s Patrick Thomas reports, as part of a plan to make the company carbon neutral by 2040. The mega-order from the suburban Detroit-based startup Rivian Automotive comes as the company faces criticism over its environmental impact, including a threatened walkout by some of its own employees to press the company to take action on climate change issues. The environmental impact of e-commerce has become a growing concern, and United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. have been rolling out their own electric vehicles in selected operations. Amazon looks set to overtake those efforts with plans to have 10,000 of the new vehicles on the road as early as 2022 and all 100,000 by 2030.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nShipbuilders may get a boost from burgeoning petrochemical trade. A surge in demand for ethane in industrial operations could drive orders for up to 40 very large gas carriers in the next 12 months, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Costas Paris writes, with much of the business likely to go to South Korean shipyards. The American Bureau of Shipping\u2019s Aditya Aggarwal told a conference in Houston that U.S. exports of the gas are soaring as the price of by-product of shale production declines. Global trade in the gas has grown to eight million metric tons annually, and several production sites are due to go online in the next couple of years as U.S. exporters strike more deals in Asia and South America. At $120 million each, the new ships will be welcome additions at Korean shipyards that are still seeking financial equilibrium.\n\nThe shutdown of some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities is changing crude tanker flows in surprising ways. Facing a potential shortage of its own supplies, the kingdom is reaching out to foreign producers for crude and other petroleum products, Sarah McFarlane, Benoit Faucon and Summer Said report, effectively ramping up imports so it can maintain exports. The steps come as the attacks on Saudi oil sites continue to roil global oil supply chains. Crude prices have been gyrating over questions of when production will be restored, including a new runup in pricing on Thursday. Tanker operators have been preparing to divert vessels to different export sites while shipping rates have soared. Reduced Saudi supplies have prompted some rival producers to offer alternatives to international buyers. Riyadh is responding with what it calls its own \u201crobust logistics network,\u201d including 16 refineries and flexible sourcing.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201c There is no sign of recovery in overseas economies. \u201d \u2014Bank of Japan Gov.
