Nunge\u2019s work behind the scenes - along with the expected loss of star forward Tyler Cook to the NBA - should put him in position to compete for significant minutes this season.\n\nIowa (23-12 in 2018-19), which is coming off its fourth NCAA Tournament appearance in six seasons, opens on Nov. 8 against Southern Illinois-Edwardsville.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was the best decision for me, my skill development and to get to, ultimately, where I want to be,\u201d Nunge said Wednesday during the team\u2019s annual media day. \u201cI got a lot stronger. I got to work on my game a lot.\u201d\n\nNunge undoubtedly could have helped the Hawkeyes a year ago. He and the coaching staff instead bet that Nunge - one of a staggering seven forwards on Iowa\u2019s roster in 2018-19 - would best help the program moving forward by redshirting.\n\nNunge had a promising freshman season, ranking second on the team with 25 blocked shots, fourth with 21 steals and fifth with 5.7 points a game. He said he has put on between 10-15 pounds since last playing.\n\n\u201cPhysically, he is in a completely different place, especially as it relates to his ability to do things in the post,\u201d Iowa coach Fran McCaffery said. \u201cHe was always a good post player, but he was on the thin side. He\u2019s not on the thin side anymore. He\u2019s finishing plays. Defensively, he\u2019s always had tremendous defensive instincts, so now you have a bigger body to combat talented players in this league.\u201d\n\nHow the Hawkeyes use Nunge in nonconference play will be one of their more interesting story lines ahead of Big Ten play.\n\nNunge is now listed at 245 pounds, but he also has a surprisingly strong shot for a guy his size, shooting 40 percent on 3s and 80 percent from the line in earning Mr. Basketball finalist honors as a prep senior in Indiana.\n\nThose numbers dipped to 33.3 percent from beyond the arc and 75.5 percent from the line as a college freshman, but Nunge\u2019s potential as a big man who can stretch the floor and create space for All-Big Ten honorable mention Luke Garza, emerging scorer Joe Wieskamp and others remains intriguing.\n\n\u201cBeing a mismatch guy,\u201d Nunge said when asked about his role. \u201cTaking somebody who may not be as good on defense on the outside, or posting up a smaller guy down below.\u201d\n\nNunge won\u2019t be guaranteed a starting spot, with Ryan Kriener and Cordell Pemsl also competing for frontcourt minutes. Nunge might have an inside track at playing alongside Garza quite a bit at power forward.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great shooter. Tremendous shooter. Really stretches the floor well,\u201d Garza said. \u201cHe\u2019s really comfortable on the block now as opposed to earlier in his career.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In an era when many college players want to speed up their careers in hopes of going pro, Iowa's Jack Nunge took an unusual step back last season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Luke Meredith"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
