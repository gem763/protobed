(IMP.JO) on Thursday reported a swing to a net profit for fiscal 2019 after benefiting from higher prices for platinum group metals in the year.\n\nThe South African miner, known as Implats, made a profit of 1.47 billion South African rand ($98.5 million) in the year ended June 30, compared with a loss of ZAR10.68 billion in the year-earlier period.\n\nHeadline earnings for the year--which strip out certain one-off items--came in at ZAR3.04 billion, compared with a headline loss of ZAR1.23 billion in fiscal 2018.\n\nRevenue for the year rose 36% to ZAR48.63 billion, Implats said. Revenue was boosted by an increase in refined production of PGMs, which translated into higher sales volumes.\n\nDuring the financial year, Implats sold 1.52 million ounces of platinum and 928,800 ounces of palladium, both up on the previous year. While the achieved platinum price declined 12% to $827 an ounce, the achieved palladium price rose 22% to $1,185 an ounce.\n\nDespite the bumper results, Implats said it had decided against declaring a dividend, given the uncertain and volatile economic outlook and the restructuring process that continues at its Impala Rustenburg operations.\n\nWrite to Oliver Griffin at oliver.griffin@dowjones.com; @OliGGriffin\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 05, 2019 01:40 ET (05:40 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
