He was 68.\n\nA sharecropper\u2019s son, Cummings became the powerful chairman of a House committee that investigated Donald Trump, and was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, Maryland, as well as richer suburbs.\n\nTrump 'rat-infested' attack on Elijah Cummings was racist, Pelosi says Read more\n\nAs chairman of the oversight and reform committee, Cummings led multiple investigations of the president\u2019s governmental dealings, including several in 2019 relating to the president\u2019s family members serving in the White House.\n\nTrump responded by criticising the Democrat\u2019s district as a \u201crodent-infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live\u201d. The comments came weeks after Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of colour to get out of the US \u201cright now\u201d and go back to their \u201cbroken and crime-infested countries\u201d.\n\nCummings replied that government officials must stop making \u201chateful, incendiary comments\u201d that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy.\n\n\u201cThose in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behaviour,\u201d Cummings said in a speech at the National Press Club.\n\nCummings\u2019 long career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.\n\nCummings continued his rise in Congress. In 2016, he was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi committee, which he said was \u201cnothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign\u201d for president.\n\nCummings was an early supporter of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential bid in 2008. Throughout his career, Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS.\n\nCummings was born on 18 January 1951. In school, a counsellor told him he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfil his dream of becoming a lawyer. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d Cummings told Associated Press in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. \u201cMy whole life changed. I became very determined.\u201d\n\nIt steeled Cummings to prove that counsellor wrong. He became not only a lawyer, but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become House speaker pro tem, the first black delegate to hold the position. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit.\n\nCummings was quick to note the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats. \u201cAfter coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it\u2019s clear that the lines are drawn here,\u201d Cummings said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996.\n\nCummings chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight.\n\nHe cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected.\n\n", "description": "Regular Trump target and key figure in impeachment investigation died on Thursday", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5477c4f3322a399ef747f10ef0faf8094365414f/0_0_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf4d99e4a53b311440d02d292f8ceed1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
