REUTERS/Ammar Awad/File Photo\n\nAttorney-General Avichai Mandelblit has already said he intends to file criminal charges against Netanyahu in high-profile cases that have dominated Israeli headlines for years.\n\nBut at a series of pre-trial hearings Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers are arguing that prosecutors should not press charges in three graft cases.\n\nIsrael\u2019s longest-serving leader denies any wrongdoing. But he has fought two inconclusive parliamentary elections this year under the shadow of allegations that opponents seized upon, waving \u201cCrime Minister\u201d banners at political rallies.\n\nHis chief opponent, former general Benny Gantz, said he would not serve in a cabinet led by a prime minister who faces indictment.\n\nHere is a guide to the criminal cases surrounding Netanyahu.\n\nWHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST NETANYAHU?\n\nThe attorney-general announced in February that he intends to file criminal charges against Netanyahu in investigations listed as cases 4000, 1000 and 2000, pending the outcome of the hearings. Netanyahu could face fraud and breach of trust charges in all three cases, and bribery charges in case 4000.\n\nNetanyahu says he is the victim of a politically orchestrated \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d by the media and the left to oust him from office.\n\nCASE 4000 alleges that Netanyahu granted regulatory favours to Israel\u2019s leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel, in return for positive coverage of him and his wife Sara on a news website controlled by the company\u2019s former chairman.\n\nCASE 1000 alleges that Netanyahu and his wife wrongfully received gifts from Arnon Milchan, a prominent Hollywood producer and an Israeli citizen, and Australian billionaire businessman James Packer, including champagne and cigars.\n\nIn CASE 2000, Netanyahu is suspected of negotiating a deal with the owner of Israel\u2019s best-selling daily newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage in return for legislation that would slow the growth of a rival daily newspaper.\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE PRE-TRIAL HEARINGS?\n\nThey grant the prime minister\u2019s legal team a chance to argue against the prospective charges and to convince the attorney-general to scrap or reduce them. Netanyahu is not expected to attend the hearings, which will be held on four days, ending next Monday.\n\nAfter hearing the arguments, the attorney-general is expected to decide by the end of December whether to indict Netanyahu.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF NETANYAHU IS CHARGED?\n\nIf Netanyahu is indicted it could take many months before his trial begins. He could also seek a plea deal rather than stand trial.\n\nIf still serving as prime minister, Netanyahu would be under no strict legal obligation to quit. According to Israeli law, a prime minister must step down if ultimately convicted, but can stay in office throughout legal proceedings, including appeals.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivers a statement in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, Israel September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File photo\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s supporters in parliament have said they would support granting him immunity from prosecution. But it is unclear whether there are enough lawmakers to back such a move.\n\nIF CONVICTED IN A TRIAL, WHAT DOES NETANYAHU FACE?\n\nBribery charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in jail and/or a fine. Fraud and breach of trust carry a prison sentence of up to three years.", "description": "Two weeks after fighting and failing to win an election, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced trouble on a second front on Wednesday at legal hearings to decide whether he must face trial for corruption.", "authors": ["Maayan Lubell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435873758&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902PI"}
