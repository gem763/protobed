The platform uses natural language algorithms to sort through the stock reports of over 5,500 Wall Street analysts, determining who made the best calls, and which recommendation brought in the best returns. The result is a comprehensive database of stock analysts, rated and ranked by success and return. When you see 5 stars next to a TipRanks analyst, you know who to trust.\n\nToday, we\u2019ve pulled reports from three of the top analysts in the TipRanks database. These Wall Street wizards have success rates in excess of 70%, and average returns above 20%. We\u2019ll look at a recent recommendation from each of them, to see what makes a stock compelling to the experts.\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nOppenheimer\u2019s Glenn Greene is currently ranked #1 in the TipRanks database. He earned his five stars with an 84% success rate on his stock calls. Greene\u2019s average return of 21.3%, indicating that the stocks in his coverage universe are profitable as well as bullish.\n\nGreene has recently issued a report on Mastercard, the credit card company. The top analyst had attended the company's Investor Day, and came away with a bullish outlook, giving the stock a Buy rating and a $312 price target (15% upside from current levels).\n\nMastercard isn\u2019t really a credit card company. Rather, it\u2019s a payment processor, for cards issued with the company brand. Mastercard\u2019s business model is built on a range of income streams \u2013 royalties from card issuers using the brand, fees from the card issuers for using the company\u2019s payment processing, and transaction fees from card users for the privilege of having a credit card. Like most multi-stream incomes, the model is resilient in bad economic times and highly profitable in good times. A look at the stock\u2019s recent performance bears this out.\n\nMarkets swooned in Q4 of 2018, and the S&P 500 slipped 14%. MA shares showed a steeper loss, of 21%. But where the S&P has since made an impressive 22% rebound, MA has gained an even more impressive 50% since bottoming out. Mastercard\u2019s most recent report, for Q2, showed a 12% revenue gain, to $4.11 billion, and an adjusted EPS of $1.89 per share, well ahead of the $1.83 expected.\n\nAll of that forms the background to Glenn Greene\u2019s meeting with company management. In Greene\u2019s words, \u201cMA maintains a sizeable global market opportunity and continues to emphasize its broad B2B opportunity (particularly around accounts payable), Services business and real-time ACH capabilities. Encouragingly, MA's intra-quarter volumes through August remained directionally stable with both July and 2Q19 levels. We remain quite encouraged by MA\u2019s strategic direction and that its long-term growth trajectory remains intact.\u201d\n\nWall Street\u2019s analysts have been nothing but bullish on MA over the past three months. Out of 16 analysts, all 16 are bullish on the stock. With a return potential of 17%, the stock's consensus target price stands at $317.31.
