We just don\u2019t know how many.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An attendee wears a tinfoil hat as \u2018alien hunters\u2019 gather outside an entrance to Area 51 in Rachel, Nevada, on Friday. Photograph: Bridget Bennett/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMichael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the event \u201ca perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies and the desire to know what we don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nThe result, Borer said, was \u201chope and fear\u201d for events that include the \u201cArea 51 Basecamp\u201d featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko, and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name Alienstock.\n\n\u201cPeople desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,\u201d Borer said. \u201cArea 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can\u2019t go. When you tell people they can\u2019t do something, they just want to do it more.\u201d\n\nEric Holt, the Lincoln county emergency manager overseeing preparations, said he believed authorities could handle a total of 30,000 visitors to Rachel and Hiko.\n\nStill, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the Storm Area 51 Facebook post weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThose that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,\u201d said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.\n\nThose who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against \u201ccritters, snakes and scorpions\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will get cold at night. They\u2019re not going to find what they\u2019re looking for, and they are going to get angry,\u201d Arnu said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Photographer said it was unclear if arrests were made as crowd gathered at 3am Friday in response to hoax to \u2018raid\u2019 the base", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7524fd1c33d10dba057a272429d25b4343e3170f/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6a206cd269d0fa827a3e452a49ad811f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
