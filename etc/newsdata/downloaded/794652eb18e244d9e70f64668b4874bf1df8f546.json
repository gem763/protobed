After all, Themba Gezane treated her like a queen, lavishing her with grand gifts and romantic getaways.\n\nThe couple\u2019s traditional wedding was an elaborate affair that saw Kelly Khumalo serenading their 300 guests. Their white wedding \u2013 aired on the reality show Brinnette stars in \u2013 was equally extravagant, and the bride wore two designer dresses. But it wasn\u2019t long before her happiness turned to horror.\n\nBrinnette says behind closed doors her marriage was far from a picture-perfect fairytale. Speaking exclusively to DRUM, the reality TV star alleges she suffered abuse at the hands of her husband. We meet Brinnette (39) at De Hoek Country Hotel just outside Johannesburg, where she and the rest of the cast of The Real Housewives of Johannesburg (RHOJ) are filming the second season of the hit show.\n\nShe\u2019s happier now that she\u2019s split from Themba, she says. Brinnette claims he abused her days into their marriage. \u201cWe had just come back from our honeymoon in New York, and we had an argument,\u201d she says. \u201cI went to work but because I was still stressed, I called two of my friends and we had lunch. At around 7pm, my one friend said he was making dinner so I decided to go with him.\n\n\u201cThemba knew him and knew I was with him because I video-called him earlier, showing him where I was and who I was with.\u201d\n\nShe kept her husband informed of her whereabouts, but Brinnette says there was hell to pay when she got home. \u201cWhen I got home, he wasn\u2019t himself. When I got into bed, he started a fight with me and shoved me out of bed,\u201d she says, her eyes filling with tears.\n\n\u201cHe screamed hurtful things at me and told me to get out of his house and that he wants a divorce. It was as if he was fighting with another man. \u201cHe continued to punch and kick me. Eventually he got on top of me and strangled me. I remember thinking, in my tipsy state, \u2018This guy is going to kill me if I don\u2019t do something\u2019. So, I kicked his private part to stop him.\n\n\u201cBut it didn\u2019t stop there \u2013 at some point he poured fruit cocktail juice all over my head and I had to sleep in that sticky mess. To this day, I don\u2019t drink fruit cocktail juice.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t immediately feel the pain, she says, but once the adrenaline wore off, Brinnette was in agony. \u201cAt around 4am, I woke him up because I was in so much pain I couldn\u2019t move. \u201cHe told me he was still sleeping, and he\u2019d take me to the hospital when he wakes up at around 7am,\u201d she says, tears now streaming.\n\n\u201cThe nurses kept asking what happened to me. I had to lie because he was standing right there. I was scared. The nurses and the doctor could tell I was lying and when we finally had some privacy, they urged me to open a case.\u201d\n\nBrinnette says she didn\u2019t open a case because she was scared and hoped he would never hit her again. Eventually she confided in friends because she didn\u2019t want to worry her mother, Junia Senne (56).\n\n\u201cMy one friend told my mom, and that was the beginning of the end. I remember hearing my mom\u2019s voice on the phone and just bursting into tears.\u201d\n\nIn the five months they\u2019d been married, she claims, Themba beat her three times. Later, he would apologise and buy her gifts. The situation carried on until Brinnette\u2019s mother, her stepfather, Simon Dube (65), who had helped raise her, and her grandmother, Abigail Seopela, urged her to come back home.\n\n\u201cI suggested to Themba that we separate, and attend counselling to try and work on ourselves and our marriage. But while I was doing that, he kept bringing in girls to our house, into our bed.\u201d\n\nBrinnette stayed with Themba despite the alleged affairs and abuse. The entrepreneur, who owns a wellknown spa in Rivonia, Johannesburg, says she reached her breaking point in October. \u201cI was preparing to write a test that would usher me into a marketing course I wanted to study. I told him I was going home to study for it and would come back after writing it.\n\n\u201cThemba responded by telling me not to bother going back to the house if I go home. I left that marriage with nothing but my handbag and school backpack, wearing the dress and sneakers I was wearing that day.\u201d\n\nShe met Themba through social media six years ago when he sent her a direct message on Instagram. Her friends warned her they weren\u2019t suited to each other, but Themba was relentless and she struck up a friendship with him. They met face to face on his birthday in May 2015 and started dating in May 2017.\n\n\u201cAfter 100 days of dating, he proposed to me with 100 roses and a candlelit dinner. Themba was very romantic, I\u2019ll give him that,\u201d she says. \u201cI also liked the fact that he did things the right way \u2013 he first asked my mother\u2019s blessing before proposing to me. Everyone loved him. Even my friends changed their minds once they saw how he treated me.\n\n\u201cHe was so romantic in the beginning. He treated me like a queen, so sweet and loving. It was easy to fall for him, so when he proposed, I said yes.\n\n\u201cThere was a little voice inside that said, \u2018Maybe you\u2019re rushing things\u2019, but I chose to ignore it because not marrying him wouldn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nNow Brinnette believes the gifts and trips were all part of a ploy to manipulate her and the people around them.\n\n\u201cThe first time I suspected he might not be the person he portrays himself as, was at a party we were hosting,\u201d she says. \u201cOne guest came with their friend and he gave him a hard time. Eventually, he jumped on the guy, tried to beat him up.\n\n\u201cHe thought that guy wanted me. He shouted things like, \u2018You\u2019re undressing my woman with your eyes, I\u2019m going to \u201cthere was no interest\u201d, he says. They struck up a friendship two years later through a mutual friend, Sonia Mbele, who is also the executive producer of RHOJ. In September he proposed to Brinnette, and when her lease ended in October, she moved in with him. That\u2019s when the trouble started, according to him.\n\n\u201cBefore we got married, we had some major disagreements over the cost of the wedding,\u201d Themba says.\n\n\u201cI spent over a million rand for the traditional wedding \u2013 she had so many demands for her dress and erecting marquees that would be dismantled the next day. All of this was for the show, to place herself in a certain light. \u201cIt was no longer about us and our union, so I stood my ground on several things. When I told her, \u2018I didn\u2019t marry you for TV, I wanted a wife\u2019, she\u2019d accuse me of not being supportive,\u201d he says.\n\nThe couple also argued about their white wedding.\n\n\u201cShe wore two dresses, one cost over R100 000, and the other was R40 000. The flowers alone cost R400 000. I mean, how can you spend over R400 000 just for flowers? \u201cThat\u2019s not how I was raised. I wasn\u2019t staying true to who I was.\u201d\n\nThemba rejects Brinnette\u2019s claims he beat her after their honeymoon.\n\n\u201cI postponed our honeymoon for a week because she had had a miscarriage and I wanted to mourn. \u201cOn our way back we weren\u2019t talking. She was upset about the amount of money I gave her to spend on herself there. \u201cWe landed in the morning and by the afternoon she was gone, only to come back in the early hours of the next morning. Even before we got married, she\u2019d go out and come back at ungodly hours. Sometimes I\u2019d complain about it and she\u2019d tell me her mother didn\u2019t give her such curfews, so I\u2019d let it go,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter their wedding Themba put his foot down.\n\n\u201cI told her we\u2019re married now, we must spend time with each other. That night she Facetimed me to show she was out with her gay friends. \u201cI\u2019m not discriminating, she wanted to show who she was with and that it was harmless. But a married woman at nightclubs on a Sunday night? Come on.\u201d Brinnette confirms she had suffered a miscarriage. \u201cYes, I did have a miscarriage just before our honeymoon. It\u2019s still very difficult to talk abou f**k you up\u2019, things like that. And that\u2019s a pattern I noticed \u2013 he was very violent and rude to other people.\n\n\u201cWhen I confronted him about these things, he\u2019d always use the excuse that he was drunk.\u201d\n\nHis explanations did little to ease the gnawing feeling in her gut. \u201cYou know that sixth sense? There was something in me that didn\u2019t sit well with everything.\u201d\n\nThings came to a head when she realized she didn\u2019t want to stay in an unhappy marriage for fear of what people would say. \u201cI chose myself \u2013 I chose to love me enough to leave because I was going to leave in a coffin if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn February, Brinnette filed for an official end to their marriage. She says Themba didn\u2019t contest it or appear in court for the finalisation in May. \u201cI\u2019ve been free since, and I\u2019m enjoying my freedom. Now I can focus on myself, my businesses, as well as the charity work I do.\u201d\n\nShe partnered with two other businesswomen in an eyelash business that recently got off the ground. She\u2019s also filming scenes for the highly anticipated second season of the RHOJ, where viewers will be taken on her journey of heartbreak.\n\nBrinnette believes she\u2019ll find her Mr Right one day. \u201cI\u2019m a hopeless romantic and forever will be,\u201d she says. \u201cI still believe in love.\u201d\n\nWe meet Themba at a caf\u00e9 in Kyalami to hear his side of the story. Themba says he\u2019s never laid a hand on Brinnette, and maintains they are still married. The pair met at his birthday party but \u201cthere was no interest\u201d, he says. They struck up a friendship two years later through a mutual friend, Sonia Mbele, who is also the executive producer of RHOJ.\n\nIn September he proposed to Brinnette, and when her lease ended in October, she moved in with him. That\u2019s when the trouble started, according to him.\n\n\u201cBefore we got married, we had some major disagreements over the cost of the wedding,\u201d Themba says.\n\n\u201cI spent over a million rand for the traditional wedding \u2013 she had so many demands for her dress and erecting marquees that would be dismantled the next day.

It\u2019s still very difficult to talk about.\n\nThey argued frequently, Themba says, often about money. \u201cShe\u2019d max out the card I gave her for emergencies. I refused to give her more money to just splurge because we needed to watch how we used our money, especially after the weddings.\n\n\u201cShe threatened to get money from other people, and I saw other men sending her money on her phone.\u201d He didn\u2019t abuse her, he insists, but Themba admits one of their heated rows became physical.\n\n\u201cOne morning she came back at 3am when she said she\u2019d be back by 11pm. I was tired of this behaviour and told her to go back where she came from. She refused and we had a scuffle \u2013 that\u2019s when I pushed her and told her to leave,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cShe claims she injured her knee when I pushed her, but I don\u2019t remember seeing her fall. In the morning I took her to the hospital, and she was taking pictures of her knee, telling people I abused her.\u201d\n\nBrinnette went to stay with her parents for a week until her mother and cousin sat down with them both. \u201cThey told us to love and respect each other, and to live within our means. She returned home after that. But things didn\u2019t get better,\u201d Themba says.\n\n\u201cI kept trying to show her how much I love her, taking her out to beautiful spots for her birthday and buying her random gifts and flowers, but she kept secrets from me.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out about some of the secrets, I\u2019d confront her, and she\u2019d get upset and throw tantrums.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the short time we were married, Brinnette accused me of a lot of things. She forgets that I know so much about her and could easily destroy this image she\u2019s trying to portray.\n\n\u201cAll that I ask of her is to leave me alone \u2013 she must stop lying to the world, making me out to be a monster, because I\u2019m not. Even the cheating she accuses me of, I know nothing about. \u201cI\u2019m the one who suggested we see a therapist. I wanted us to address the things she was hiding from me, that directly affected me. I wanted us to rebuild trust, but she refused.\u201d\n\nThemba says he\u2019s never been served any divorce papers. Brinnette declined to show DRUM the documents.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a private matter,\u201d is all she\u2019ll say. It remains to be seen if they\u2019re legally separated, but according to Themba their relationship has run its course. \u201cNow, it\u2019s over, I don\u2019t want her back,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want us to move on and for her to stop lying about me.\u201d", "description": "Real Housewives\u2019 Brinnette Seopela opens up about alleged abuse \u2013 but Themba Gezane says she is nothing but a liar.", "authors": ["Nkosazana Ngwadla"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9532/88c8bcc351004b92ae5ed02cb7133f87.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
