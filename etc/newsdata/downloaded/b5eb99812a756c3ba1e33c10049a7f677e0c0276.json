The agency added that around 150 new offshore projects were slated for completion during the next five years.\n\n\"In the past decade, two major areas of technological innovation have been game-changers in the energy system by substantially driving down costs: the shale revolution and the rise of solar PV,\" Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, said in a statement Friday. \"And offshore wind has the potential to join their ranks in terms of steep cost reduction.\"", "description": "The offshore wind sector has the potential to transform the planet's energy mix.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106203673-1572003158324gettyimages-841378708.jpeg?v=1572003188", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
