He Stays Impressively Calm.", "language": "en", "text": "Members of Common Defense, an anti-Donald Trump veterans group that supports impeachment, ambushed Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) on Capitol Hill this week, badgering him about how he could let President Trump \"run roughshod\" on democracy and drag the U.S. into more wars.\n\nOne of the men, who did all the talking, repeatedly referred to Trump as a \"criminal\" and demanded to know why Crenshaw was being \"complicit\" in his agenda.\n\n\"How can you just sit there idly by and not do your duty?\" the activist demanded of Crenshaw. \"You cannot be complicit in this man's crimes.\"\n\nIn his pursuit, the veteran also pressed Crenshaw over whether he'd bother to read the Robert Mueller report, which he says has several impeachable offenses in it.\n\n\"You need to get your courage back,\" he yelled at Crenshaw.\n\nAmazingly, the freshman congressman kept his cool.\n\nGOP Rep @DanCrenshawTX hid in an elevator today when combat vets confronted him about his support for Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re standing up for our democracy and holding Trump's cronies accountable.

One of Trump's \"cronies?\" Please.\n\nAs you can see in the video, Crenshaw keeps his cool, tells the men to calm down, walks on to an elevator and, as politely as he could, asks the men to leave because it was a Members Only elevator.\n\n\"You haven't made one actual point,\" Crenshaw eventually told them, accurately.\n\nSome people, including some politicians, commended the congressman for keeping his head.\n\nThis is a disgusting and desperate display. Kudos to @DanCrenshawTX for keeping his cool. These guys know this is not the way they should represent themselves or their vet status, dishonorable. #veterans. https://t.co/Ei0IO8o3C4 \u2014 Scott Taylor (@Scotttaylorva) September 20, 2019\n\nCrenshaw didn't have to engage with the upset vets, but he did. And he was right. The men did not have any intention of having a robust debate about national security or foreign policy. They just wanted a viral video.\n\n\"You came here to make a video,\" Crenshaw observed. \"You didn't come here to have a conversation.\"", "description": ".09/20/2019 18:38:25PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/163/fda0581b-9e77-49f3-9681-af924edba00d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
