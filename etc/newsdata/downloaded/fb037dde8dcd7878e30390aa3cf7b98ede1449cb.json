I have asked a multitude of people about this so-called service offered by the DWP and virtually everyone I have spoken to knows nothing about this entitlement.\n\nI am now in the process of going to a tribunal case with no support, just representing myself to fight the system for a payment that I feel so strongly I have been unfairly duped out of and was clearly entitled to.\n\nI am told it was my responsibility to check what I was entitled to at the time. But why, as a working person who was never entitled to anything, would I in my grieving state ever go to the DWP to ask?\n\nIt is a simple case that I feel must have happened to thousands of people in the same scenario as myself.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nSteve Webb replies: Someone who is coping with bereavement and who is not receiving any benefits may well not realise that help may be available to them through the social security system.\n\nAlthough unfortunately it may be too late to put things right for you, I hope that this column will alert others to the existence of bereavement benefits for bereaved people of working age.\n\nThe system changed in 2017, and therefore I will explain both how it worked when you lost your husband and how it does now, plus what Government information is currently available to the bereaved.\n\nHow did the system work when your husband died?\n\nThere were three elements to the pre-2017 system:\n\n- A lump sum \u2018bereavement payment\u2019 of \u00a32,000;\n\n- A \u2018widowed parent\u2019s allowance\u2019 which was an ongoing weekly payment for those with dependent children;\n\n- A \u2018bereavement allowance\u2019 which was a (generally lower) ongoing weekly payment for bereaved people aged over 45 without dependent children.\n\nRather confusingly, there were two different time limits for claiming these benefits.\n\nAnyone claiming either the widowed parent\u2019s allowance or the bereavement allowance had to claim within three months of the bereavement. But those claiming only the lump sum had up to 12 months to claim.\n\nUnder normal rules, unfortunately this means that you would not be able to make a successful claim after six years.\n\nIf you were widowed before your spouse reached state pension age, your own payouts could get a boost More than a quarter of a million bereaved pensioners currently benefit from a state pension uplift from National Insurance contributions made by a spouse who died before official retirement age. But the Government only tops up your income when it is aware you are a widow, widower, or surviving civil partner, says Steve Webb. Find out how to check you're getting the right amount here.\n\nWhat bereavement payments are available now?\n\nThe current system was introduced in April 2017 and the main benefit is called a \u2018bereavement support payment\u2019.\n\nIt is in two parts \u2013 an immediate lump sum (which can help with things like funeral costs and other immediate outgoings) and a regular monthly payment for the following year.\n\nDifferent rates are payable to those with dependent children and those without.\n\nThose with children get a lump sum of \u00a33,500 followed by 12 payments of \u00a3350, whilst those without children get a \u00a32,500 lump sum plus 12 payments of \u00a3100. A claim has to be made within three months of the bereavement.\n\nThis is a National Insurance benefit and the person who died must have paid a minimum amount in National Insurance Contributions. The eligibility rules are here.\n\nYou are only entitled if you were married or in a civil partnership with the person who died. Unfortunately couples who live together do not qualify, even if they have children together.\n\nIn general, the bereaved person must be under state pension age, though there are some very limited exceptions to this.\n\nWhat does the Government do to alert people about bereavement payments?\n\nYou raise an important point about people not being aware of this benefit.\n\nIn general, the Government\u2019s view is that the onus is on the individual to make inquiries and to claim what they are entitled to. But clearly they have recognised that there is a problem with bereaved people not claiming this benefit.\n\nI have contacted the DWP and they tell me that those who report a bereavement using the \u2018tell us once\u2019 service will receive a letter prompting them that financial support may be available.\n\nThey are also given contact details for the Bereavement Service - its helpline is 0800 731 0469.\n\nIt sounds as though this is what happened in your sister-in-law\u2019s case. It is unfortunate that you were not alerted when you lost your husband.\n\nThe Government website now has a helpful step-by-step guide to what people should do when someone has died, including a reference to claiming relevant benefits, and that can be found here.\n\nA more comprehensive set of resources for the recently bereaved can be found on the Royal London website here.", "description": "I sadly lost my husband six years ago.
