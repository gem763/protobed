Do you think I would waste his time talking about this stuff?\"\n\nShe also said Mr Johnson had nothing to do with an additional \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to her company by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in January.\n\nAnd she denied reports he had written her a letter of recommendation to run the taxpayer-funded Tech City organisation, promoting technology companies in east London.\n\n'A close bond'\n\nMs Arcuri told Good Morning Britain the pair shared \"a love\" and \"passion\" for Shakespeare and literature during their friendship,\n\n\"Boris is extremely personable. He cares a lot about this country, and he cares a lot about people... he is a guy you want to hang out with.\"\n\nAsked whether she ever loved Mr Johnson, she said: \"I've been asked that many times. And I care about him deeply as a friend, and we do share a very close bond, but I wish him well.\n\n\"I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again.\"\n\nWho is Jennifer Arcuri?\n\nJennifer Arcuri describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer.\n\nShe began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMs Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers.\n\nBut it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson.\n\nThe network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012.\n\nSince then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.", "description": "The US businesswoman is at the centre of a row over the PM's actions when he was London mayor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q9v83.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
