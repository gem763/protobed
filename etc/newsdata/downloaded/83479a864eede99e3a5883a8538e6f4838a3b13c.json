Lawmakers are still analyzing the findings.\n\nIn another blow to the food and drinks industry, Davies called for a ban on the consumption of food and drinks on public transport. The only exceptions would be to drink water, breastfeed or for those with medical conditions like diabetes.\n\nIn 2017, more than \u00a3300 million ($367 million) was spent on advertising soft drinks, confectionary and sweet and savoury snacks, compared to \u00a316 million spent on advertising fruit and vegetables, according to the report.\n\nIt referenced data from Nielsen AdDynamix, which showed confectionary products made up 18% of total annual advertising expenditure in the U.K., sweet and savoury snacks made up 17% of total expenditure, and soft drinks contributed 11%. Commercials for fruits and vegetables made up 2.5% of the overall spend.\n\n\"Research shows that children respond to unhealthy food advertising on television by eating more,\" Davies said. \"They then fail to compensate at subsequent meals so this will, over time, lead to weight gain. Limiting this on-screen advertising, as proposed by the government, can make valuable contributions to improving children's health.\"\n\nCommercials for junk food were banned across London's public transport network in February.", "description": "A prominent medical expert in the U.K. has called for a ban on junk food ads as part of a range of proposals aimed at cutting childhood obesity rates.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106174500-1570712777960gettyimages-159067602.jpeg?v=1570712887", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
