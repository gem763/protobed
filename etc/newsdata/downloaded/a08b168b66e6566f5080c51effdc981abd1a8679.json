That made TPG much more visible to local residents, and more vulnerable to their opposition.\n\nAs 5G technology rolls out, bigger players such as Telstra and Optus will need a lot more small cell networks, potentially exposing them to the same community resistance experienced by TPG.\n\nWhile other telcos downplayed the business risk, they nevertheless said they were taking it seriously. Optus said it was preparing to step up its efforts to ease concerns about the health impacts of 5G, as it moves ahead with its rollout.\n\nLambo Kanagaratnam, vice president of network deployment at Optus, said: \"We always consult with the community when installing a small cell. Given heightened concerns around small cells and 5G we will be stepping up our community engagement processes.\" This would include letter drops inviting local residents to provide feedback on Optus' proposals.\n\nThere are no established health effects from the radio waves that the 5G network uses. \u2014 The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA)\n\nAndrew Sheridan, Optus head of policy and public affairs, said Optus relied on \"respected, independent scientific experts and organisations for our information about the safety of 5G and electromagnetic energy\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"One of these experts is The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), the government\u2019s primary authority on radiation protection and nuclear safety. Here\u2019s what they have said: 'There are no established health effects from the radio waves that the 5G network uses'.\"\n\nMost credible scientific and health bodies, including the World Health Organization, agree there is little evidence of health risks associated with mobile technology, but that has not prevented the emergence of a passionately anti-5G movement.\n\nTheir concerns include that 5G will operate on spectrum bands \u2013 the so-called 'millimetre wave' bands \u2013 that have a much a higher frequency than the bands used for 4G, supposedly moving them closer to the genuinely dangerous end of the electromagnetic spectrum, that includes x-rays and gamma rays.\n\nA petition on Change.org makes the following dire claims: \"Research shows that 5G millimetre wave radiation will make people sick, especially unborn children, young children, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic illness. The predicted adverse health effects include cancer, infertility, cataracts, headaches, neurological malfunction, cardiac irregularities, and insomnia, in much higher numbers and potency than that being experienced as a result of 4G by electro-hyper-sensitive people today.\"\n\nA survey by Roy Morgan, published in August, found one in four Australians was concerned about the health impacts of 5G.\n\nMr Althaus said while \u201cnothing would change the minds\" of the hardcore sceptics, he hoped the majority of that 25 per cent of people who have concerns would be convinced by mainstream scientific research that shows no health risks linked to 5G.", "description": "Australian telecoms companies are preparing a charm offensive to appease growing community concerns that 5G technology will expose them to dangerous levels of radiation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.176%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_11/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/91919eed0603f657a1965ec703e1bbe7292b9694", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
