Now her own father is living with dementia and she uses this knowledge base, both professional and personal, to support other people living with the condition at Live Better With.\n\nBarbara Stephens, dementia specialist and caregiver in chief at Live Better With, who has cared for three family members with dementia\n\n\u2018The aim is to help people live their lives as fully as they can, for as long as they can, so it\u2019s about sharing the best ways to do that,\u2019 Barbara explains. \u2018With dementia, relationships, activity levels and capacities may change but the specialised products available on Live Better With, like easy-to-use radios and music players, help us to remember that the person, and their interests, are still the same.\n\n\u2018Engaging with carers and people living with dementia via our forums, newsletters and articles also enables families to cope with the condition in an informed way, but also their own way.\u2019\n\nCassandra Farren, 39, found the real stories and diaries written by the Live Better With community helpful\n\nFor author Cassandra Farren, 39, it was the real stories and diaries written by the Live Better With community that helped her make one of the hardest decisions of her life: to take her mother, 73, to live in permanent residential care, four years after the dementia diagnosis.\n\nBy the time single mum-of-two Cassandra was making a 60-mile round trip twice a week to care for her mum, and give her father some respite, she knew the family could no longer cope without professional help.\n\n\u2018Who helps the person caring for the carer?\u2019 asks Cassandra. \u2018I was in a constant state of anxiety about providing enough support to both of my parents and ultimately reached my breaking point in 2018, when I didn\u2019t feel strong enough anymore.\u2019\n\nReading about how other users dealt with the condition is what reassured Cassandra that residential care was a decision made by many other family carers in the UK, every day.\n\n\u2018Without the solidarity of other people going through it, I don\u2019t know how I would have coped,\u2019 Cassandra explains.\n\n\u2018It was the small pieces of advice that people shared, like: Never say \u201cgoodbye\u201d or mention \u201chome,\u201d and don\u2019t wear a coat because it looks like you\u2019re leaving, that made mum\u2019s transition into care easier for both of us. Until that point, I didn\u2019t feel like anyone understood what I was going through.\u2019\n\nJacquie left behind a job she loved to take on primary care for her husband Tony, who has remained at home since his diagnosis nine years ago at the age of 58\n\nMuch like Cassandra, it was that feeling of social isolation that former teacher trainer Jacquie Nunn, 67, struggled with when her husband Tony was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 2010, at the age of 58.\n\nThere are an estimated 42,000 people under the age of 65 living with dementia in the UK, even though it is a condition more commonly associated with older generations.\n\nJacquie left behind a job she loved to take on primary care for Tony, who has remained at home since his diagnosis nine years ago.\n\nShe says: \u2018At 67, it\u2019s hard not to look around at what other people are doing with their retirements.\n\n\u2018After the diagnosis, it felt like the rug had been pulled from under our feet and you have to adapt to a life where you\u2019ve lost your work, your friends, your sense of self.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t remember the last time I went to the cinema, or did anything alone, because I can\u2019t leave Tony by himself. It can be very isolating.\u2019\n\nJacquie says peer support has been invaluable\n\nPart of what has made a difference has been practical advice articles, like the ones written by Barbara Stephens, and Live Better With community forums.\n\n\u2018Peer support is invaluable, for all sorts of reasons,\u2019 Jacquie says. \u2018When you\u2019re approaching 60 and you\u2019re diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, you can feel like an outsider. As the person diagnosed, there\u2019s this sense of being different from the rest of the world. So, having contact with other people in the same situation is immensely important at first.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s also practical from a carer\u2019s perspective. There\u2019s a whole raft of things that come at you with a diagnosis, like lasting power of attorney, wills, benefit entitlements and personal independence payments (PIP), so that shared information and advice is brilliant.\u2019\n\nLike Cassandra, Jacquie feels as if she has been left behind when it comes to professional help. The only breaks Jacquie gets are when Tony spends time at a day centre for 12 hours a week, and this is a service that Tony has to pay for.\n\nThere are an estimated 42,000 people under the age of 65 living with dementia in the UK, even though it is a condition more commonly associated with older generations.\n\nShe says: \u2018A lot of service providers seem unaware of the number of people living with dementia outside of their ambit. We haven\u2019t been contacted by some services for over a year, despite being on their books.\n\n\u2018If Tony\u2019s liver or heart had failed him, his needs would have been met by the NHS, but brain disease simply doesn\u2019t receive the same support.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s thanks to healthcare platforms like Live Better With that forgotten communities like informal carers have a place to seek practical support and guidance for living with dementia.\n\nBarbara adds: \u2018As a society, we have to accept that dementia is part of our lives. The products and services of Live Better With reflect what everyday life could become for many hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so important that we understand the condition better and learn how to include people with dementia in our everyday activities, treating them with respect, dignity and compassion.\u2019", "description": "Dementia is known to impact the lives of loved ones, who report reduced social contact, a lack of support and neglect for their own wellbeing as a primary carer for a person with dementia.", "authors": ["Becky Freeth"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/16/19783866-0-image-a-13_1571239287330.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
