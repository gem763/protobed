That was a day after the physics award was given to a Canadian-American and two Swiss, and on Monday the Physiology or Medicine award went to two Americans and one British scientist.\n\nSo far, nine Nobel prizes have been awarded this week and all the laureates are men.\n\nThe coveted Nobel Peace Prize is Friday and the economics award on Monday.\n\nIn March, the foundation behind the Nobel Prize in literature said the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust. The Nobel Foundation had warned that another group could be picked to award the prize if the academy didn\u2019t improve its tarnished image.\n\nThe literature prize was canceled last year after a mass exodus at the exclusive Swedish Academy following sex abuse allegations. Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011. Arnault allegedly also leaked the name of Nobel Prize literature winners seven times.\n\nAmong the favorites for the literature award are Canadian poet Anne Carson, novelists Maryse Cond\u00e9 of Guadeloupe, Can Xue of China and Canadian writer Margaret Atwood, author of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which has been made into a hit TV series.\n\nIn his will, Swedish industrialist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel specifically designated the Swedish Academy as the institution responsible for the Nobel Prize in literature. Other institutions in Sweden and Norway were given the task to find winners for the other Nobel Prizes.\n\nNobel decided the physics, chemistry and medicine should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo. His exact reasons for having an institution in Norway handing out the peace prize is unclear, but during his lifetime Sweden and Norway were joined in a union, which was dissolved in 1905.\n\nWednesday\u2019s chemistry prize went to John B. Goodenough, a German-born engineering professor at the University of Texas; M. Stanley Whittingham, a British-American chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Binghamton; and Japan\u2019s Akira Yoshino, of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian-born James Peebles, 84, an emeritus professor at Princeton University, won the physics prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology together with Swiss scientists Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva. The latter were honored for finding an exoplanet - a planet outside our solar system - that orbits a solar-type star, the Nobel committee said.\n\nA day earlier, two Americans and one British scientist - Drs. William G. Kaelin Jr. of Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Gregg L. Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter J. Ratcliffe at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain and Oxford University - won the prize for advances in physiology or medicine. They were cited for their discoveries of \u201chow cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\u201d\n\nWith the glory comes a 9-million kronor ($918,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates receive them at an elegant ceremony on Dec. 10 - the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death in 1896 - in Stockholm and in Oslo.\n\n___\n\nJan M.
