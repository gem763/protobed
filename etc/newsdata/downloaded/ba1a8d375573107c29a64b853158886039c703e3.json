The company said that workers will return to their normal functions at Embraer, without any Boeing involvement, until the deal is approved.\n\nEmbraer said this month that it expects the deal to close in early 2020, in the wake of the additional regulatory scrutiny. Previously, Embraer had said the deal would close by the end of 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Marcelo Rochabrun; editing by Richard Pullin)", "description": "Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA  will furlough almost 15,000 workers in January, the company said, ahead of a partial takeover by Boeing Co , a deal that still needs regulatory approval.
