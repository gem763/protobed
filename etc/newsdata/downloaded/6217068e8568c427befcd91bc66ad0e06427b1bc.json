Sign up for the Today\u2019s WorldView newsletter.\n\nA disagreement over President Trump\u2019s Afghanistan strategy doomed the tenure of John Bolton, Trump\u2019s third national security adviser. Bolton exited the White House this week after falling out with Trump and other senior administration officials over the president\u2019s desire to host militant leaders of the Taliban at Camp David. Trump ultimately decided against the set piece and later declared the talks with the Taliban \u201cdead,\u201d but Bolton\u2019s opposition to the process and differences with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2014 whose envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was leading the negotiations \u2014 proved to be the last straw.\n\nTrump has spent the days since announcing Bolton\u2019s departure via tweet complaining about his former aide\u2019s missteps. A growing list of candidates for the top foreign policy post in the White House include a nuclear envoy, a hostage negotiator and an outspoken ambassador. But while Washington fixates on its palace dramas, Afghanistan is on a knife-edge.\n\nIn fact, my views on Venezuela, and especially Cuba, were far stronger than those of John Bolton. He was holding me back! https://t.co/FUGc02xiac \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019\n\nThough U.S. talks with the Taliban could be revived down the road, both sides have vowed to step up battlefield attacks. Afghanistan is already in the grips of one of the most violent periods of its recent history. Hundreds of civilians have died in a spate of bombing attacks in the past few weeks linked to the Taliban and other militant groups. According to U.N. data, American and Afghan airstrikes against militant positions between May and August increased by about 60 percent from the previous year. As it is, 2018 marked the bloodiest year for civilian deaths in the Afghan conflict since records have been kept.\n\nNow, with the U.S.-led talks on ice, attention falls on embattled Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who is determined to stage new presidential elections as planned on Sept. 28 even in the absence of a long-mooted cease-fire with the Taliban. Ghani and his allies bristled for months on the sidelines as Khalilzad and U.S. officials engaged directly with the Taliban with Kabul out of the loop. Top Afghan officials argued the Trump administration was \u201cdelegitimizing\u201d Ghani\u2019s rule in its bid to wind down an 18-year war. Critics in the Washington establishment worried rapprochement with the fundamentalist Taliban would spell trouble for the country\u2019s women and vulnerable minorities.\n\nThe weeks ahead are fraught. \u201cThe onus is all on Kabul now, and especially on President Ghani, to come up with a realistic strategy and create a national consensus that can lead to a settlement,\u201d Davood Moradian, director of the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies, said to my colleagues. \u201cHe has often been an opportunist, but this is a chance for him to be a statesman.\u201d\n\nThe election campaign takes place under a cloud of suspicion and doubt. Ghani\u2019s opponents accuse him of using government resources to skew the race in his favor. The Taliban has called on Afghans to boycott the vote; observers fear many will decide against casting a ballot out of intimidation and fear. Hundreds of polling stations sit in areas effectively controlled by the militants.\n\nBut the now-stalled talks with the Taliban hardly helped matters. Even as U.S. officials and Taliban emissaries were shuttling back and forth to meetings in Qatar, various militant factions were exploding car bombs and launching suicide and rocket attacks in strikes that killed scores of Afghans.\n\nThe Taliban were simultaneously \u201cnegotiating peace with Americans and waging war against civilians,\u201d Jawed Ludin, a former senior Afghan diplomat, said to my colleague Siobh\u00e1n O\u2019Grady last week. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be able to get away with such reckless and unacceptable levels of violence and bloodshed because this is really pushing the boundaries.\u201d\n\nThe end of Trump\u2019s talks provides a kind of clarity. \u201cThere is definitely a silver lining to this,\u201d Haroun Mir, an analyst based in Kabul, told The Washington Post. \u201cThere was total confusion before. Everyone was afraid the U.S. would sign a cease-fire but the Taliban would continue their war against the Afghan government and people. Now President Trump has personally rectified this with his own tweet.\"\n\nGhani and his allies say they will stand defiantly against Taliban threats of violence. \u201cHaving the ability to inflict pain and violence is not necessarily a sign of strength,\u201d Amrullah Saleh, Ghani\u2019s running mate, said in an interview with the Indian Express in which he accused the Taliban of being a Pakistani proxy with little political legitimacy at home. \u201cTheir violence is not backed by any political manifest. They have no charismatic leaders. All their politbureau are based in Pakistan and are not showing their faces.\u201d\n\nMy heart aches when Afg women ask me if they should be fearful of the infamous deal & will their rights truly vanish.What a motivating question. Wow. I say with or without the world with us we won't , WE WON'T allow the terrorist thugs to push you into shadows. NEVER. EVER. \u2014 Amrullah Saleh (@AmrullahSaleh2) September 9, 2019\n\nTrump had had enough of the thorny intractability of the war in Afghanistan. Like a growing number of Americans across the political spectrum, he saw the expense in blood and treasure of nearly two decades of U.S. operations and decided it was time to end it. But critics contend that his abrupt and volatile decision-making is only sowing the seeds for more chaos.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the Trump administration\u2019s approach isn\u2019t negotiating with the Taliban, it\u2019s the president\u2019s reckless behavior in the service of himself that fans the flames of his chaos-first foreign policy,\u201d Stephen Miles, executive director of progressive organization Win Without War, said in an email statement. \u201cThis latest incident adds to the pile of evidence that Trump isn\u2019t the dealmaker he claims to be.\u201d\n\nThe aborted Taliban talks present a picture of Trump\u2019s foreign policy impulses in a microcosm. \u201cTrump interpreted his predecessors\u2019 record with these intractable problems as a license to disrupt. He broke with allies and embraced adversaries,\u201d wrote Time magazine\u2019s Brian Bennett. \u201cHe neutered the internal policy process that every president since Eisenhower has relied on. He issued policy changes via tweet, with little or no consultation. With the collapse of the Afghanistan talks, it\u2019s worth asking whether Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach has proved any better at solving the world\u2019s problems, whether he\u2019s made them worse, and what the costs have been.\u201d\n\nIn the months ahead in Afghanistan, we may start to get a sense of the price.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
