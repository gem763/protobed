The walk was also a community work initiative and was held under the auspices of Be the Difference Foundation,\u201d said Carlene Schietekat from Northpine, a fourth-year student and secretary at the foundation.\n\n\u201cAlong with the theoretical courses, I am placed at an organisation with the aim of building up experience in casework, group work, community work and social work administration and management. It was required of me to execute a community work project at that organisation. I am placed at a hospital in Bellville and the proposed project entails a health and wellness fun walk that started at 11:00 on Wednesday,\u201d she said.\n\nDue to the hospital\u2019s strict rules and regulations, the name of the hospital may not be mentioned and photos of the patient\u2019s faces may not be taken, for confidentiality purposes.\n\nAccording to her the walk also created awareness for the upcoming World Prematurity Day on Sunday 17 November.\n\nThe walk was led by Schietekat and Anita Ntshanga and various staff members of the hospital partook in the walk. Once the mothers reached the end of the walk, they were provided with refreshments and a fun-filled activity was done.\n\n\u201cA handprint of the mommy and a footprint of the baby was done as part of the activity \u2018make your mark\u2019. Each mother also received a custom-printed t-shirt (captioned Proud Preemie Mom) and a goodie bag filled with various necessities, from toiletries to baby products.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the walk was not only to create awareness but to instil a sense of hope and light into the mothers and to remind them that their lives and their babies\u2019 lives matter.\n\n\u201cThe walk served as a reminder that there are various ways of handling conflicting emotions and daily stress,\u201d Schietekat said.", "description": "A fun walk with mums and premature babies was held on Wednesday 25 September in Bellville to create awareness for prematurity and to celebrate the lives of premature infants.", "authors": ["Avril Fillies"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9419/6aa16c4aa16f4e7ca97a3b28f7afe0ce.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
