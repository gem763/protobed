But.", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Jackal Pan/Visual China Group via Getty Images\n\nEric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, was one of two members of the Federal Open Market Committee who dissented from last week\u2019s vote to cut interest rates by a quarter point. On Friday, he gave a speech about why. And a lot of media outlets focused on one specific observation Rosengren made: That low interest rates appear to be encouraging commercial landlords to take on more risk than they may realize by renting to office-sharing companies like WeWork.\n\nWhat does WeWork have to do with interest rates? Rosengren starts by talking about how low rates affect investors generally: Because low rates mean lower returns on loans and bonds, investors look for other kinds of assets (like stocks and real estate) that can produce a greater return. But because investors become more inclined toward those kinds of assets, they bid up the prices, meaning they also produce lower yields, expressed as the ratio of, say, a property\u2019s price to its net income from rentals. Basically, when interest rates are low, any asset you buy is going to produce a lower yield than if rates were high (not just bonds).\n\nIn that kind of environment, owners of office buildings may become eager to increase the income from the buildings they just paid so handsomely for. Enter WeWork: It may be willing to pay higher rents than traditional tenants, because it uses the real estate more intensively (more workers in less space). And landlords might demand that additional rent because WeWork poses some risks that a normal tenant would not.\n\nWeWork\u2019s business model is risky in part because it agrees to long-term leases with the owners of office buildings, and then effectively subleases that space on a short-term basis. WeWork\u2019s leases are years long, but its clients are often on month-to-month terms, and if the economy goes south, WeWork could face a sudden exodus of clients whose businesses are failing, or who are even choosing to work from home to save money. WeWork would still be stuck with its own leases, set at rents that reflect stronger economic conditions than actually exist.\n\nThat\u2019s not just WeWork\u2019s problem. Much of that risk is transferred to WeWork\u2019s landlords, because if WeWork is no longer receiving enough income from customers to cover its lease obligations, it could default on its leases. It wouldn\u2019t have to go bankrupt to do this: WeWork\u2019s IPO prospectus notes that many of its leases are not in WeWork\u2019s own name but those of special-purpose entities owned by WeWork. That means WeWork is not fully on the hook for its own rent; if there is a default, the landlord can only pursue the special-purpose entity, which has limited assets.\n\nThere are mitigating factors: WeWork notes that capriciously defaulting on its leases would damage its reputation and make it hard to sign leases in its future. The company also notes that it has, in some cases, posted letters of credit and security deposits that would lead to financial penalties if it stops paying rent. But our worry is about a negative economic condition, where WeWork likely isn\u2019t looking to sign new leases anyway and is trying to triage major financial obligations in the face of declining demand for flexible office space. When companies are running out of money, they do things they never expected to do, like break their leases.\n\nPlus, a key source of cash WeWork has used to finance money-losing operations \u2014 eager equity investors willing to invest at high valuations based on expectations of massive growth \u2014 has already dried up.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.

But should the rest of us care? In 2007, home mortgage defaults weren\u2019t just a problem for banks; they led to a cascading effect that took down financial institutions, home prices, ordinary consumers and the broader economy. This is an example of what Rosengren is warning about: high leverage, possibly exacerbated by low interest rates, that encourages risk taking (such as leasing to WeWork) that could have contagious effects when investments go bad.\n\nBut office sharing is a tiny slice of the economy. In May, the office brokerage firm CBRE estimated that WeWork and its flexible-office competitors (like Regus) take up approximately 2 percent of all office space in the US. Even markets with \u201chigh\u201d office-sharing penetration, like San Francisco and Manhattan, are only above 3 percent. The thing about the housing bubble is it was both huge and hugely central to the economy. WeWork is not.\n\nThis is where it\u2019s important to note that Rosengren was talking about WeWork as just one example of a broader phenomenon. He\u2019s also worried about leveraged loans to corporations: These have gotten more leveraged in recent years, meaning a relatively small decline in economic or corporate performance can push the borrowing corporation into default. And he\u2019s worried about these two stories (office sharing and leveraged loans) as examples of how the low interest rate environment may be encouraging investors to take on risks they may regret in an economic downturn.\n\nI do not find this story to be convincing overall \u2014 and neither apparently does the full FOMC, which cut interest rates over objections from Rosengren and his colleague Esther George of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. You can point to specific areas where investors are being silly, but overall I do not see an economy full of risk appetite.\n\nGrowth has been moderate for a decade and businesses have, if anything, been reluctant to expand and grow too fast. Homeowners are much less leveraged than they were in 2006. In fact, the low appetite for risk is a reason interest rates are low: People are not that interested in borrowing money, and the rates have to be cut to low levels to induce them to do so.\n\nSo while I do expect some economic pain from the shaking out of the WeWork bubble and some similar phenomena in other parts of the economy, I don\u2019t think the effects will be big enough to matter very much to those of us who are not directly invested.", "description": "Outgoing CEO Adam Neumann\u2019s business model does pose some real risks for the commercial real estate market.", "authors": ["Josh Barro"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/24/24-adam-neumann-wework.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
