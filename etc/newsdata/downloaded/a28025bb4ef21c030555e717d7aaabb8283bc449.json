Many times it is with different equipment. The real key is that we can talk and communicate both safely and effectively together.\"\n\nAdmiral Aquilino appeared on a panel with senior commanders from the French, Indian, Indonesian, Japanese and Fijian navies.\n\nAs Australia seeks closer ties with Pacific Islands as part of its \"Pacific step-up\", Fiji's chief of navy Humphrey Tawake said the impact of China's Belt and Road Initiative could be seen across most islands through construction of new infrastructure.\n\nHe said China's initiative and the Quad partnership between Australia, the US, Japan and India would influence the region through their respective programs.\n\n\"Each sovereign small island state will determine its own requirements to cater for its national security needs and infrastructure development,\" he said.\n\nIn her speech to the conference, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds confirmed a review of the 2016 defence white paper's strategic underpinnings was underway because of the rapidly changing environment.\n\nAdmiral Aquilino's speech came after Mr Trump caused shockwaves by announcing the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria, effectively removing a protective shield around Kurdish forces who had been allies in the fight against the Islamic State terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Trump's move paves the way for Turkey to launch an offensive against the Kurds, although following a backlash Mr Trump warned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan of consequences if he did so.\n\nAdmiral Aquilino's address comes as the US and China are locked in a fierce competition over trade and strategic influence.\n\nTo mark the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule, China showcased its latest military hardware during a three-hour parade in Beijing last week, with analysts noting that missiles and bombers supposedly capable of targeting warships and US bases featured heavily.\n\nAsked by the Financial Review for his thoughts on what the focus on missile technology means for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, Admiral Aquilino said it was clear the region was becoming more contested.\n\n\"We've certainly seen an increase in capability and capacity, as would be expected, so certainly not a surprise,\" he said.\n\n\"The adherence to international law is critical. Adhering to the global commons and the fact that the maritime is there for all nations, I think that would be a great way forward. We should all operate safely together.\"\n\nIn his presentation to the conference, Admiral Aquilino noted how nations large and small had benefited from a free and open Indo-Pacific in the 75 years since the end of World War II.\n\n\"Before this period of extended prosperity, nations from America to the south-west Pacific Islands had suffered belligerence, uncertainty and at times paid with their lives,\" he said.\n\n\"The lesson was clear: no single nation who calls the Pacific Ocean can or should dictate terms to others in the regions.\"", "description": "The head of the United States' powerful Pacific Fleet has stressed the importance of military alliances for the preservation of regional security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2564%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_139%2C$y_198/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1d320c69ecbdabdd8c892ed187c073c31bee4e88", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
