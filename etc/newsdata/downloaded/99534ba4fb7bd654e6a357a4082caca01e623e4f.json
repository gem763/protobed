(Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\nHe said single-pad rinks in the urban core are more likely to be targets for closure because rinks in rural areas also tend to be community hubs, and are often the only city facility in the area.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, arena rentals at the city's 44 ice pads fell by 10,000 hours, Chenier said.\n\n\"We need to address that, that we have a declining demand and a supply that has continued to increase. We need to adjust that to meet what we need,\" he said.\n\nLinda Tremblay, director of community programs, said staff haven't yet arrived at a number of rinks to be closed, or decided which ones might be on the chopping block.\n\nShe said the city is waiting to consult residents to figure out why the decline is happening.\n\n\"We want to hear what happened,\" Tremblay said. \"We do have some proof that we have some older adult leagues, some men's leagues, that will pay more at the private ice because it's at a better time now.\"\n\nAs well as competition from private and university rinks, changing demographics and a general drop in hockey enrollment may be contributing factors, she said.\n\nWhen the time comes to close arenas, Tremblay said staff will weigh each one against the five nearest facilities, and will ask the community for feedback on other possible uses for the buildings.\n\nThe city's community and protective services committee will receive the staff proposal next month.", "description": "The\u00a0City of Ottawa is considering closing or repurposing some single-pad rinks\u00a0\u2014 mostly aging arenas in the urban core\u00a0\u2014 because of a drastic drop in ice rental.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3548005.1473194914!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kids-at-hockey-practice-at-tom-brown-arena.png"}
