The rear has a bathroom and laundry that leads to the courtyard.\n\nThe terrace is so skinny that a Fiat 500 is more than a metre longer than the width of this property. The house also has no hallways due to its size.\n\nMr Haimandos said while feedback has been positive, buyers have made a few remarks about the bedroom.\n\n\u201cSome buyers have said the bedroom feels like a hallway because of its size,\u201d he said.\n\nUnderneath the main home is a basement stretching along most of its length, which is currently used for storage. There is also another storage room at the rear of the property that could be turned into a studio or second bedroom.\n\n\u201cThere is scope to extend the property into the under house storage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terrace has no price guide at this early stage, with Mr Haimandos noting it had been hard to find comparable sales for property like it.\n\nSkinny homes are not uncommon in Sydney. During the property boom in 2015, a narrow house in a back alleyway of Surry Hills sold for $965,000 \u2014 $250,000 above the price guide. No. 29 Terry St had a width of only 2.85m and a land size of 38sqm.\n\nAn auction for the London St property will be held on October 31 at Ray White Newtown auction rooms.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE LATEST NSW REAL ESTATE NEWSLETTER", "description": "A house in Enmore up for sale might just be Sydney\u2019s skinniest home, with it so small that even a parked Fiat 500 out the front would dwarf it.", "authors": ["Matt Bell"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/13130040/capi_2eaab14c1bb9ec3a05c4ed9447e79440_2dc97e95ca6cb51b614b36263cc2f844.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
