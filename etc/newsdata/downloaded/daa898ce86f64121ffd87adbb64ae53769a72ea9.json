The singer took a photo with a fan in the park and was shot walking around dressed pretty discreetly. She was wearing a black hoodie, black sweatpants, and black sunglasses with her hair in a bun:\n\nThis is Gomez's third time at Disneyland in the last two months. She went two days in May\u2014the Sunday before Met Gala and Met Gala Monday\u2014with friends. For those outings, she dressed pretty comfortably too, wearing hoodies both times.\n\nGomez has a busy month ahead of her. Her film The Dead Don't Die will be coming out on June 14, and Gomez will be doing press for it. She'll also likely be at some if not all of the film's premieres. Gomez is notably due to appear on Live With Kelly and Ryan on June 12.\n\nThe singer has kept a relatively low profile on social media, but she did post an Instagram video last night of herself being unable to twitch her nose on one side. It was just a fun, candid moment. \"I\u2019m not sure why my mind went there?\" she captioned it, acknowledging that it was random:\n\nGomez has spoken about why she has deliberately limits her time on Instagram. She told Coach on its Dream It Real podcast that she doesn't think too much Instagram is necessarily good for anyone.\n\n\"It is not that healthy to be on it all the time because I noticed with me, I got kind of depressed looking at these people who look beautiful and amazing, and it would just get me down a lot so I just think taking breaks is really important,\" she started. \"But just know that most of it isn\u2019t real. And I hate to say that, I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but it\u2019s very unrealistic in a lot of ways, and I think that for me, I want to protect the youngest generation because they are exposed to so much information, and I feel like that causes a lot of anxiety at the youngest age. Like, I didn\u2019t grow up with that. I had dial-up internet. I think that sometimes people are exposed to too much, and you should really protect what you\u2019re seeing and be mindful, be really mindful of how it makes you feel.\"\n\nFollow House Beautiful on Instagram.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "She dressed very discreetly for her visit to the park.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GQtspsFWpUH9A_8M5OTamA--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/house_beautiful_336/95055b8e06049331870b2720101b1fd4", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
