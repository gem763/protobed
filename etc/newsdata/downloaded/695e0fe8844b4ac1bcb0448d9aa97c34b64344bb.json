We are ready for a no-deal, even if we do not want it.\n\nHe added: \u201cNo-deal will never be the choice of the EU \u2013 If that happens, it would be the choice of the United Kingdom. But agreement or not, this is not the end of the story. The whole future relationship with the UK remains to be defined.\u201d\n\nThe tit-for-tat rhetoric came as Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said he still believed a deal could be struck. But he reiterated that the British plan as it stood was not enough to use as a base for \u201cdeeper negotiations\u201d, echoing Brussels\u2019 stance.\n\nMr Johnson had hoped to spend the weekend ramping up negotiations around his suggestions for a replacement to the Irish border backstop, but European diplomats snubbed the request amid concerns the plans fell short. Instead, they said, the UK could present new ideas next week.\n\nHowever, the UK Brexit secretary has insisted that \u201cwe are not backing down\u201d and the government would not set Northern Ireland \u201cadrift\u201d from the UK\u2019s customs area. Stephen Barclay, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, added: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more time.
