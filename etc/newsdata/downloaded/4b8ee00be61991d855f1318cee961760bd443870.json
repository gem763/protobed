They were originally booked on Thomas Cook, but after the firm\u2019s failure rebooked through flights they found on Skyscanner.\n\nThe outbound flight on Jet2 was problem-free, but the inbound leg on Flylolo will not be going ahead.\n\nMs Frater told The Independent: \u201cWe are now stuck here as there are no flights home on Friday. Our hotel is also full so we are not able to stay on here.\n\n\u201cOur only option is to cut our holiday short or stay on another three or four days if we can get another hotel. My youngest is nine months so supplies of milk and food won\u2019t last either.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur insurance company have said that they won\u2019t be helping so it\u2019s left entirely up to us to sort out our travels home,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe have already paid out more than \u00a35,000 on this holiday for my family of four alone, and now we are looking to having to pay up to a further \u00a32,000 just to get home.\u201d\n\nMr Dendle told The Independent: \u201cWe planned the flights over a year ago, the seats had sold well and we were into profit.\u201d\n\nHe said that Flylolo had received \u00a31.2m from 3,000 passengers, representing an average of \u00a3400 per traveller \u2013 and a profit margin of 9 per cent.\n\nBut, said Mr Dendle: \u201cThe issue was the aircraft we thought we had a firm agreement on was withdrawn.\n\n\u201cWe have spent the weeks leading up to the departures in trying to find an alternative, the issue was the cost in relation to rates we had agreed.\u201d\n\nHe said that quotes were coming in excess of \u00a31.3m.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have these additional funds, because we had been running the company expenses from our own resources.\n\n\u201cAll our costs were paid from our capital base which has been eroded by the economic malaise caused by Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Dendle is a Conservative councillor on Arun District Council in West Sussex. He has campaigned for the UK to leave the European Union and join EFTA for a maximum of two years, and criticised \u201cthe incompetent moves by Parliament\u201d.\n\nHe told The Independent: \u201cI personally feel emotionally exhausted in trying to resolve this problem and I apologise for the disruption and disappointment caused.\n\n\u201cI am personally heartbroken and sincerely feel for the the affected clients.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s spokesperson, Andrew McConnell, said: \u201cWhere an Atol-licensed tour operator is unable to deliver the services it has sold to its customers, we would expect them to refund passengers in full.\n\n\u201cWe therefore advise Flylolo customers to contact the operator directly for further information.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Skyscanner, which is where many passengers found the Flylolo flights, said: \u201cWe truly sympathise with those travellers whose flights with Flylolo have been cancelled and we are doing our best to find out more information from Flylolo.\n\n\u201cThe operator has historically been well-rated by travellers on our site at over 4 out of 5 stars, and this is the first time we have encountered an issue. However due to the current situation, we have now removed them from our site.\u201d", "description": "Thousands of travellers heading for Spain for half-term have been told their flights have been abruptly cancelled.
