This too shall pass.\n\nFirst we had journalists hyping an entirely anonymous book by the same author of the entirely anonymous anti-Trump op-ed published by The New York Times in September 2018.\n\nAnti-Trump journalists swallowed this one like a handful of M&Ms handed out to trick-or-treaters.\n\nANONYMOUS OFFICIAL BEHIND INFAMOUS NYT OP-ED TO RELEASE BOOK ON TRUMP WHITE HOUSE\n\nAre the charges in the op-ed true? Is the book accurate? With the writer hiding his or her identity like someone in the witness protection program, there\u2019s no way of knowing and no way of challenging the writer\u2019s claims.\n\nThen things got even weirder.\n\n\u201cCBS This Morning\u201d journalist Nikole Killion apparently time-traveled to promote her fantasy ticket for the 2020 election. She actually pressed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., about whether he would pick fellow socialist media magnet Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as his vice presidential running mate if he becomes the Democratic nominee to run against Trump.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with this fantasy. The Constitution says the president and vice president must be at least 35 years old, and that means Ocasio-Cortez won\u2019t be old enough to be elected to one of those offices until the 2024 election.\n\nTime travel was all the rage. Politico's senior White House reporter Darren Samuelsohn must have been watching \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d for story tips. He took his readers on a time-travel trip to the scariest future he could imagine \u2014 in a Politico Magazine story headlined \u201cWhat If Trump Wins?\u201d\n\nOh, no, Mr. Bill. Not that!\n\nSamuelsohn actually called his article a trip into \u201cthe POLITICO Time Machine.\u201d\n\nAs the reporter envisioned it, Trump defeats Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in a close Electoral College battle, after losing the popular vote. \u201cBut this mixed verdict has done nothing but further entrench the battle lines of a civil war that has become more than just a metaphor,\u201d Samuelsohn writes ominously.\n\nThe fantasy went on to predict that \u201cpeople have been killed.\u201d Trump orders \u201ctroops onto the streets of Washington\u201d and helps secure the 2024 nomination for first daughter Ivanka Trump.\n\nYes, this hallucination ran on the pages of an alleged news organization and was written by a senior White House reporter. And in case it wasn\u2019t clear enough, the message was: support Trump and you get civil war and tyranny.\n\nPolitico, D-D.C., has never been subtle.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more pre-Halloween hijinks by Trump haters masquerading as journalists.\n\nMSNBC \u201cMorning Joe\u201d host Joe Scarborough decided that just as people wouldn\u2019t admit they supported Trump the first time, \u201cpeople will be reluctant to admit publicly that they can\u2019t put up with him anymore.\u201d Despite a whole world of liberal media that would sing their praises.\n\nScarborough based the entire premise that \u201cactually the fear and loathing is rising\u201d on one conversation he had with a man in Florida. So, Florida Man is deciding the world view of an entire TV show.\n\nOf course, this is the same Joe who also claimed a few days ago that Trump had committed massive crimes and it\u2019s \u201call about failed casinos.\u201d According to Scarborough, Trump \u201cis owned by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin because he\u2019s been laundering money, Russian money for the last 20, 30 years.\u201d\n\nThe easiest way to tell Scarborough is lying is he still claims he\u2019s \u201ca conservative.\u201d\n\nHarvard student journalists attacked for practicing journalism\n\nCollege is where many student journalists learn the basics of their craft \u2014 asking knowledgeable people \u201cwho, what, where, when, why and how\u201d about the stories they cover \u2013 and seeking comment from more than one side.\n\nHarvard Crimson staffers certainly got a lesson in how this works last week. They learned that Harvard leftists are biased idiots every single day.\n\nAnd what\u2019s worse, the leftists expect their college newspaper to reflect that worldview, such as it is.\n\nThe Harvard Crimson has a storied history going back 146 years. But history isn\u2019t the paper\u2019s problem. It has a problem with current events and the unwillingness of campus leftists to accept them.\n\nHarvard leftists held a pro-immigration rally to protest the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The Crimson covered the event but had the audacity to ask ICE for a comment, which it didn\u2019t provide.\n\nThe lefties were outraged by \u2026 journalism. The far-left group that organized the initial protest, Act on a Dream, even launched a petition to stop the Crimson from ever doing journalism again. The petition whined about the paper\u2019s \u201ccultural insensitivity\u201d and demanded the staff \u201capologize for the harm they inflicted.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were upset because they claimed the paper informed on them to The Man. What\u2019s funny is that the paper went out of its way to not do that, waiting until the event was over to ask for the comment it never got.\n\nThe paper is standing up to protesters \u2014 for now. At least this should provide the student journalists a clear lesson for the future. Leftists demand and usually receive fealty from most professional journalists. So the student journalists might stand up now, but they\u2019ll be expected to bend the knee later on.\n\nThe one group it\u2019s OK to hate\n\nThere\u2019s one group journalists love to hate: old white guys who are Republicans or conservatives, or maybe both.\n\nThat racial double standard was on full display last week when journalists screamed about Trump using the word \u201clynch\u201d but forgot they hadn\u2019t been bothered by it when Biden and other Democrats used the term during the Clinton impeachment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut the \u201cneutral\u201d news media really worked itself into an uproar when roughly two dozen Republicans entered a House closed-door impeachment hearing this past week without authorization.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Donny Deutsch blasted the Republicans to the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d audience. He called them \"those white guys, those middle-aged, boring, nerdy-looking white guys.\u201d (Donny apparently has no mirrors in his home or office.) Picture an outlet mocking the race of congressmen when Democrats staged an anti-gun sit-in on the House floor in 2016.\n\nCNN went even further. Commentator Keith Boykin said the action by Republican House members was reminiscent of the KKK. \u201cThis looked like a Klan group assembled outside a jail trying to get the sheriff to let them in so they could deliver justice to somebody who was inside,\u201d he told anchor Jake Tapper. For his part, Tapper responded with the mildest of critiques. \u201cRespectfully, I think the Klan metaphor was a little strong,\u201d he said.\n\nYa think?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe only bright spot came on CBS when \u201cLate Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert mocked the race of the Republicans as well. Because, at least he was funny. He described the scene, saying, \u201cThat is a large herd of white men. By the way, a herd of white men is called a \u2018A J. Crew.\u2019 A \u2018J. Crew\u2019 of white men.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, it\u2019s OK to make fun of people\u2019s race as long as they\u2019re on the right.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR", "description": "With Halloween arriving on Thursday, some journalists let their imaginations go wild and wrote about the frightening nightmare that haunts them \u2013 the reelection of President Trump.", "authors": ["Dan Gainor", "Dan Gainor Is The Vice President For Techwatch", "Business", "Culture At The"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/22/694940094001_6096874610001_6096875730001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
