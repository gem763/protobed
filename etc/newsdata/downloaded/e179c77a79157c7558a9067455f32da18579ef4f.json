And he was invited to so many events, she said, \u201cI started saying, \u2018No, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just too much hoopla for him \u2014 you know, he\u2019s not the pope.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Mancinelli retained a trim build, a steady hand and a full head of snow- white hair. Even in his final years he spent long hours on his feet, in a pair of worn, cracked black leather shoes.\n\nHis good health baffled his doctor, he said. He was on no daily medication and never wore glasses.\n\n\u201cHe never took a pill in his life,\u201d Ms. Dinezza said. \u201cTowards the end, people would follow him through the grocery store just to ask him the secret to living that long. He\u2019d just point up to God.\u201d", "description": "A barber who spent nearly a century of cutting hair in upstate New York \u201cdidn\u2019t know the meaning of the word retired.\u201d", "authors": ["Corey Kilgannon"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/obituaries/25Mancinelli1/25Mancinelli1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
