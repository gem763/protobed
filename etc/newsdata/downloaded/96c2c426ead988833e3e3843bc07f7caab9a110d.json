Gold, which hit a string of more-than-six-year highs as stocks sold off in August against a backdrop of increased equity market volatility and an escalating U.S.-China trade war, has pulled back this month as equities steadied. Gold is down around 1% so far this week and 1.9% since the end of August.\n\n\u201cSo, unless risk appetite turns sour again, or the dollar slumps \u2014 say, as a result of hawkish ECB or a very poor U.S. CPI report tomorrow \u2014 gold could extend its losses further,\u201d said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, in a note, referring to the August consumer-price index.\n\nAnd gold looks more vulnerable to further weakness than silver, he said, \u201cgiven the rosier sentiment towards risk assets, with [silver] being supported by its other main use as an industrial material. Hence, or otherwise, the gold-silver ratio has been falling, making silver more appealing (or less attractive to the sellers) in the short term.\u201d\n\nIn other metals trading action, December palladium PAZ19, +1.17% rose $8, or 0.5%, to $1,562.10 an ounce, while October platinum PLV19, +0.78% gained $6.30, or 0.7%, to $942.90 an ounce.\n\nDecember copper HGZ19, -0.53% lost 0.2% to $2.6225 a pound.", "description": "Gold futures edge higher, hovering near the $1,500-an-ounce level after pulling back this week from more-than-six-year highs as haven demand dried up on an...", "authors": ["William Watts", "Deputy Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX379_goldpi_ZG_20181031073336.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
