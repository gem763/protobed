A leaky gut (technically known as increased intestinal permeability) is when the lining of your intestine, which is supposed to keep the contents of our digestive system separate from the rest of the body, has become compromised. This allows large particles to slip through the gut membrane and enter into the bloodstream.

Stop eating foods that damage the lining of your gut If you're looking to heal your gut, it's important to avoid refined sugars, additives and preservatives, refined flours and processed foods, alcohol, charred or burnt food as well as gluten and dairy \u2013 which are both common gut disruptors. Gluten, in particular, can be particularly irritating to the gut lining, aggravating the immune system. 2. Eat foods that reduce and heal inflammation and restore the healthy gut bacteria Fermented foods like kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, and yogurt are important for replenishing your good gut bacteria. Healthy fats like coconut oil, avocado, olives, butter, fatty fish (like salmon), and healing bone broth are important for calming inflammation that has occurred as a result of having a leaky gut. The four most important things to eat, overall, are gentle foods like slow cooked stews, polyphenols (found in brightly coloured fruits and vegetables), fibre and fermented foods. 3. Get stress and sleep under control If these are out of whack, it will take a lot longer to heal a leaky gut, as you'll be promoting more inflammation, and your body will need to focus on healing that before anything else. 4. Take gut healing supplements Gut healing supplements like L-glutamine, probiotics and fish oil are an important part of the healing process and should not be overlooked. L-Glutamine might be the most effective gut healer of all, as it plays a vital role in rebuilding, healing and maintaining the structural lining of your digestive tract.
