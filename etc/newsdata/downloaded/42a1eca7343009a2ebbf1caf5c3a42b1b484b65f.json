Racing Point\u2019s Sergio Perez\n\nRicciardo, known as one of the F1\u2019s best overtakes, told Sky Sports it was a stunning result.\n\n\u201cIt was fun, always when you\u2019re able to come through the field, other than winning, it\u2019s the best race you can have,\u201d Ricciardo said. \u201cIt was a lot of fun. We were out of position this morning. We found after qualifying we had a problem with the rear of the car with the suspension so it wasn\u2019t representative of the car\u2019s pace.\n\nmedia_camera It was a bizarre day but ultimately Ricciardo was smiling.\n\n\u201cDid I think we\u2019d come up to seventh? No. But it was a lot of fun coming through.\u201d\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t like to ask to pass his teammates but had the belief he could surpass Hulkenberg and continue to push up the rankings because he knew he could do it.\n\nUnder fire team principal Cyril Abiteboul admitted it had been an odd Grand Prix.\n\n\u201cIt has certainly been a bizarre weekend, with no running on Saturday, requiring everything to be perfect from the get-go on Sunday morning,\u201d he said on the Renault website. \u201cUnfortunately, we experienced the opposite, with both cars having different issues in qualifying.\n\n\u201cDespite our low starting positions, we did not surrender and kept focused. The crew did an amazing job in the limited time before the race to turn around the cars. Both drivers had clean starts for the first time in a while and after the opening laps it was non-stop action, with an amazing number of stylish overtaking manoeuvres from Daniel and Nico. We\u2019re leaving Suzuka with both cars in the points, a nice reward for the various issues we\u2019ve had over the last races despite a car that had the capacity to score at every race.\u201d\n\nOriginally published as Bizarre twist in Ricciardo rollercoaster", "description": "Daniel Ricciardo has tasted all the lows, highs and limbo that F1 has to offer in the last 24 hours after an insane Japanese Grand Prix.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/abe9acd4b3095b3fcffd7c1bc26982bc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
