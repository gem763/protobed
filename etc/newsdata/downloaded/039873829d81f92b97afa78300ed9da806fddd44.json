These youngsters should get a good chance after the series and I am sure (the) selectors will look at it.\u201d\n\nVictory gave Sri Lanka their first T20 series win over Pakistan in seven attempts as they clinched an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.\n\nSri Lanka won the first match by 67 runs, also in Lahore. The last match will be at the same venue on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play good cricket. Congrats to Sri Lanka, who batted, bowled and fielded better than us and I think they deserved to win,\u201d said Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed.\n\nPakistan were again jolted by the pace duo of Kasun Rajitha, who dismissed Fakhar Zaman for six, while Pradeep removed top-ranked T20 batsman Babar Azam for three.\n\nBut it was Hasaranga who dismantled Pakistan\u2019s middle order as he dismissed Ahmed Shehzad for 13, Umar Akmal for a golden duck, and Sarfaraz (26) in the eighth over.\n\nUmar, also out first ball on Saturday, equalled the unwanted record for most T20 ducks (10) in a career shared by Sri Lanka\u2019s Tillakaratne Dilshan.\n\n\u2013 Rajapaksa sets tone \u2013\n\nEarlier, Rajapaksa set the tone for Sri Lanka after the visitors won the toss and opted to bat.\n\nRajapaksa, who modelled his batting on Australian great Adam Gilchrist, led Sri Lanka\u2019s fightback after they lost first-match hero Danushka Gunathilaka for 15 and Avishka Fernando for eight by the fifth over.\n\nRajapaksa added 94 for the third wicket with Shehan Jayasuriya (34 off 28 balls) as they cut loose against some short bowling from the Pakistani bowlers.\n\nThe two left-handers hit a pair of sixes and a boundary off leg-spinner Shadab Khan before both fell in the space of seven runs.\n\nJayasuriya was run out while Rajapaksa holed out off Shadab.\n\nShanaka contributed another vital cameo, swatting three fours and a six off in his 15-ball 27 as Sri Lanka added 47 runs in the final five overs.\n\nPakistan\u2019s spearhead Mohammad Amir went for 40 runs in his four overs while fellow pace bowler Mohammad Hasnain \u2014 who on Saturday became the youngest bowler to achieve a hat-trick in a T20 match \u2014 conceded 39 in his four.
