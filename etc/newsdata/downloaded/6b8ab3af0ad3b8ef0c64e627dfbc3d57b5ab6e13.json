Last year, Tagovailoa had the procedure after the Dec. 1 SEC title game and returned to play 28 days later in the Orange Bowl, although he was not at full strength.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we drill a hole from the fibula into the tibia and cast these tightropes through the bone and sync it down and tighten it,\u201d Norman Waldrop, part of the surgical team that performed Tagovailoa\u2019s surgery in 2018, told ESPN last year. \u201cWhat these tightropes do are stabilize the ankle. It holds that little bone in its home. It holds it still and stable enough that the bones don\u2019t want to spread apart.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s No. 1 team, Alabama hosts Arkansas on Saturday, then has a week off before it hosts No. 2 LSU. The initial plan called for Tagovailoa to be ready for that Nov. 9 game, although that may be unlikely. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for LSU,\u201d he told his teammates, linebacker Terrell Lewis said (via AL.com).\n\n\u201cA two-week recovery time is about as fast as I\u2019ve heard of anybody trying to get back on the field with a true high ankle injury,\u201d orthopedic surgeon William McGarvey told AL.com in December.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTagovailoa walked off the field with a slight limp after rolling his right ankle when he was sacked in the second quarter of Alabama\u2019s 35-13 victory over Tennessee. He remained in the game and completed a five-yard pass to Brian Robinson Jr. before leaving.\n\nAgainst the Volunteers, Mac Jones stepped in for Tagovailoa, who completed 11 of 12 passes for 155 yards with an interception. Jones completed 6 of 11 attempts for 72 yards.\n\n\u201cMac did some good things, and we think Mac is capable,\u201d Saban said. \u201cSo we have a lot of confidence in Mac.\u201d\n\nRead more college football from The Post:\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "If last year's injury and surgery are any guide, the quarterback could play again in a few weeks.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/duqlsJ2qUeOd8xj4qJz3Ujh5qxc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JINBLRXS7II6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
