Entertainment Inc.\n\nIn the comics and cartoons \u2014 and on film, as played by Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger and (checks notes) Jared Leto \u2014 the Joker, Batman's archenemy, is an agent of chaos.\n\nTo be clear: It's a calculating, meticulously planned chaos. That speech Ledger's Joker gives in the hospital, in The Dark Knight? Where he says he's not a planner, he's just a \"dog chasing cars?\" Yeah, that's a lie. Because underneath that terrifying, physiology-defying grin and that laugh like a hyena on nitrous, there's a coldly cunning criminal mastermind \u2014 he's just hidden it behind his purple riverboat-gambler couture and his penchant for goofy, playing-card-themed capers, hoping you don't notice.\n\nFunny thing about the Joker. (Historically, he's referred to as both The Joker and Joker \u2014 the definite article gets a lot less definitive around him, in much the same way it does around his opposite number, The Batman/Batman.) He's unique among Batman's rogues gallery. Penguin, Riddler, Catwoman, Clayface, Scarecrow \u2014 the whole lot: When they were first introduced in the comics, they were introduced by way of their origin stories. The reader encountered them embarked upon some act of moral turpitude and immediately learned their entire deal \u2014 their real name, their background and why they settled upon whichever absurd larcenous gimmick (birds, riddles, cats, etc.) that they did.\n\nNot the Joker. When he debuted in 1940 \u2014 just one year after Batman's first appearance \u2014 he didn't waste our time whingeing on about his backstory; he just set to work killin' folk. It took an unprecedented 11 years for him to earn an origin tale \u2014 and even then, it was a half-assed one. We didn't learn his real name, or his background, just that he was a crook who had jumped into a vat of chemicals to escape capture by Batman, which transformed him into the grinning ghoul we know today, the Clown Prince of Crime.\n\nIt's that version of his origin story (others have been offered over the years) that writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland made some tweaks to in 1988's unrelentingly grim The Killing Joke graphic novel, and that Tim Burton took up and played with \u2014 adding a generous dollop of Jack Nicholson \u2014 in 1989's Batman film.\n\nBoth attempts \u2014 and that original, 1951 origin tale \u2014 diminished the character. As a concept, the Joker is a beautiful (albeit vicious) butterfly; his colors dim once you pin him to the specimen board. He functions best as a symbol, an abstract representation \u2014 or more precisely a distillation \u2014 of the kind of random act of violence that birthed Batman in the first place. (Batman's parents were killed by a mugger, FYI. Don't know if you knew that. It's possible you've been sealed in a vault for the past 80 years, so just in case: alley, gun, pearls, it was a whole deal.)\n\nHe is a vector for disorder, for gleeful, heedless violence. If Batman is Merciless Order (he wasn't always, but he became so, around 1970), then Joker is Sadistic Chaos. He is Batman's perfect foil. He is, simply, The Adversary.\n\nOne of the many things Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight got right about the character is that we only think we want to know who he is and where he came from. The Joker works best, most purely, when unencumbered by the humdrum of the everyday. His motivations must and should remain mysterious, unknowable.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips' new film seeks to strip all mystery from the character and make his motivations very knowable. And in that much at least, he succeeds.\n\nMeet Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a down-on-his-luck clown for hire, only ... he's having a little trouble getting hired. Arthur has a condition that causes him to burst into laughter at random intervals, which tends to creep people out. And get him beaten up. A lot.\n\n(If you're curious about the degree of subtlety and restraint that Phillips brings to his subject, know that Joker is the kind of movie in which a bunch of punk kids beat up our hero while shouting \"Beat him up!\" and kick our hero while shouting \"Kick him!\")\n\nArthur suffers one of his many onscreen beatings at the hands (and feet) of a bunch of Wall Street bros on the subway, who taunt him by singing \"Send In The Clowns.\" Nearly in its entirety. (The scene goes on for a while.)\n\nIt's really the only time in this otherwise grounded, grim and gritty film that we're asked to suspend our disbelief at all \u2014 because, seriously, we're supposed to buy that a straight finance bro would be off-book on the second and third verses of a Sondheim number?\n\n(\"Bro! I spent last night poundin' brews and fallin' down A Little Night Music YouTube wormhole! The Dench, bro! The Dench crushed it!\" \"Naw man, you gotta see my girl CZ-J in the 2009 Broadway revival, she makes Desiree's wry and winsome melancholy A THING YOU CAN FEEL IN YOUR 'NADS BRO.\")\n\nWhen the city cuts the funding for his social worker, Arthur goes off his meds and throws himself into his would-be stand-up comedy career.\n\nIt doesn't go well. Put it that way.\n\nJoker is, ostensibly, a downfall story \u2014 a tale of how a broken man got broken in the first place. To make stories compelling, to keep audiences' interest when the conclusion is foregone, storytellers need to forgo what they know audiences already expect to see. But Phillips and his co-screenwriter Scott Silver aren't interested in iterating or innovating, because doing so would clash with their mission statement.\n\nThey want us to see Arthur as a victim, pushed into becoming a monster by his mental illness and a broken government. You may or may not find that prospect irresponsible, even dangerous. Let's leave that to social scientists. What I can tell you is that, as executed in Joker, it's wildly unconvincing and mundanely uninteresting.\n\nCertainly, Joker is tense, grimy and claustrophobic, and Phoenix's performance is a big swing, and a risky one \u2014 the kind of big, risky swing that Oscar voters historically eat up with a big ol' spoon.\n\nBut the film so desperately strives to reject comic book trappings \u2014 so aches to be seen as edgy, provocative, serious, adult \u2014 that it simply apes the tone, style and content of other, better, edgier and more provocative films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy and Fight Club.\n\nBut those films had a point of view, they had something to say \u2014 they implicated us in their onscreen violence, in the bad choices their characters made.\n\nJoker sees Arthur's transformation into a mass murderer as inevitable. It's not a choice; it's something the world does to him. As a result of his passivity, the story becomes little more than Arthur suffering a string of indignities until, one day, heroically (?), he doesn't anymore. It swiftly grows predictable, then repetitive, then dull.\n\nBut the film doesn't care \u2014 it's too busy exuding a sense of self-satisfaction, a preening, self-consciously provocative challenge to an audience \u2014 a humanity \u2014 it holds in pitched contempt.\n\nJoker thinks of itself as urgent, relevant, of the moment and \u2014 mostly, unrelentingly \u2014 not just another silly superhero movie. Ultimately, however, it devotes so much of its energy into not being about a comic book villain that it neglects being about ... much of anything, really.", "description": "Todd Phillips' film features a bravura central performance and a style that, while dutifully imitative, engenders a claustrophobic sense of dread.
