Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine whom Mr. Trump ordered removed.\n\nMr. McKinley\u2019s testimony was the latest in a string of accounts given by top career diplomats and administration officials to impeachment investigators about how experts were sidelined as the president pursued his own agenda on Ukraine, including in a July telephone call when Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.", "description": "Two top diplomatic hands \u2014 the former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the former envoy to Ukraine \u2014 are on Capitol Hill as the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry gathers steam.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/us/politics/16dc-impeachbriefing-sub/16dc-impeachbriefing-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
