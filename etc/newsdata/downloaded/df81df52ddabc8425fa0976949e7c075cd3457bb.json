Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n\u201cWe are confident this project will be developed fast and well,\u201d Mines Minister Abdoulaye Magassouba told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe have a world-class partner committed to developing this exceptional deposit while taking into account the environmental sensitivity of the site.\u201d\n\nSources told Reuters late last month that Friedland was the front-runner to take over BHP\u2019s stake in Nimba.\n\nHPX and BHP did not respond to requests for immediate comment.\n\nTRANS-GUINEAN?\n\nThe deal did not eliminate the possibility that some of the iron ore produced at Nimba, in southeast Guinea, could be taken to port through Liberia - a much shorter route than the government\u2019s preferred route through Guinea to the west coast.\n\nThe deal terms did, however, set an extra tax on any iron ore taken through Liberia - of between $0.825 and $2 per tonne.\n\nGuinea\u2019s government has separately insisted that the future developer of the Simandou iron ore deposit would have to export through Guinea, building a \u201ctrans-Guinean\u201d railway to the west coast - a distance of around 650 km.", "description": "HPX, a company run by billionaire mining investor Robert Friedland, signed a deal with the Guinean government late on Thursday to develop the Mount Nimba iron ore deposit, Guinea's mines minister told Reuters.", "authors": ["Saliou Samb", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
