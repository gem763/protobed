In other words, a stock best known for its secular losing streak has found a winning stride in 2019. The big question now: will this winning stride continue?\n\nI think it could. The hydrogen fuel-cell market continues to be sluggish in terms of consumer market adoption. But, on the commercial side, meaningful progress is being made, and this meaningful progress is powering robust revenue growth and margin expansion at Plug Power.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIf these trends persist for the foreseeable future, and there\u2019s a reasonably high chance that they will, then PLUG stock should continue to march higher.\n\nThe investment implication? If you have the appetite for a high-risk, high-reward stock and believe in the future of hydrogen technology, PLUG should be on your radar.\n\nCommercial Market Momentum Looks Good\n\nWhen it comes to Plug Power stock, it\u2019s all about the hydrogen fuel cell market. That market has its positives and negatives. Up until now, the negatives have largely outweighed the positives.\n\nNow, the positives are starting to outweigh the negatives, and the market looks positioned for healthy growth over the next several years.\n\nLong story short, alternative fuel has been a big movement over the past several years as carbon emission problems with traditional fuel sources have been highlighted as a big threat to the global ecosystem. In response, the market has birthed two alternatives \u2013 electric cars, and hydrogen cars. The former gets all the hype, mostly because the latter is less efficient, less safe, and lacks sufficient infrastructure to make it a viable alternative.\n\nBut, hydrogen fuel cell technology is starting to turn a corner. Somewhat. On the consumer side, adoption remains sluggish thanks to those three aforementioned headwinds. But, in the commercial market, big enterprises are increasingly starting to see hydrogen as a superior alternative to traditional fuel and electricity, because hydrogen fuel cells last longer and have shorter refueling times.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves here. In 2016, Plug Power revenues dropped 20% year-over-year. In 2017, they rose 20%. Revenues rose 75% in 2018, and are up 20% year-to-date in 2019. The implication? Although hydrogen fuel cells have been slow to catch on, they are finally catching on, and in a big way.\n\nWill this trend continue? Probably. The explosion of alternative fuel sources is a secular growth narrative. In that secular growth narrative, electric cars will be the Batman. But hydrogen cars should emerge as a solid Robin. In this sense, Plug Power may be in the early innings of a long term growth ramp.\n\nPlug Power Stock Has Big Upside\n\nIf the hydrogen fuel cell market ramp does persist over the next several years, then PLUG stock has substantial upside from current levels.\n\nManagement just laid out a five year growth plan wherein the company is going to leverage HFC expansion in its core commercial end-markets to drive revenues towards $1 billion and EBITDA towards $200 million by 2024. That would represent huge growth from 2019\u2019s projected bases of ~$230 million in revenue and ~$1.3 million in EBITDA, according to Street consensus estimates.\n\nWill Plug Power actually grow revenues at a 30%-plus clip and EBITDA at a near 200% clip into 2024? Probably not. It pays to remember that, back in 2015, this same management team said that Plug Power would report $500 million in revenue by 2020 on 35% gross margins.\n\nLast year, revenues were just $175 million, and gross margins were at 1.5% \u2013 neither are on track to hit those aggressive targets from 2015. Instead, 2020 revenues will likely shake out around $300 million (40% shy of the target), while gross margins may get to 30%, at best.", "description": "Shares of hydrogen fuel-cell maker Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) are probably most infamous for losing a jaw-dropping 99.9% of their value from 2000 to 2019.
