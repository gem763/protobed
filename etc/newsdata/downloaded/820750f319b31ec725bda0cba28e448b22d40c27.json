He said waterfronts on Mosman\u2019s Burran Avenue and Hopetoun Avenue, for instance, had their share of property prizes.\n\nMr Coombs is now selling a Federation manor on Mosman\u2019s Prince Albert Street that fits the bill, complete with Harbour Bridge and Opera House views. \u201cWhen people walk through the door, you hear \u2018wow\u2019 as they [walk] throughout the whole house,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Coombs is selling a trophy home at 13 Prince Albert Street, Mosman.\n\nAccording to Brad Pillinger from Pillinger, harbour views have gained more cachet in Sydney over time.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201980s and \u201990s, north-facing waterfronts were the most sought, [but over the] last 20 years as the cultural background of a portion of the market place changed, views of the city and bridge have been highly sought,\u201d Mr Pillinger said.\n\nWhile trophy homes often commanded eye-watering prices, they were not necessarily always the most expensive on offer. Mr Coombs said some homes could be priced in the $5 million to $7 million bracket \u2013 moderately low for Sydney\u2019s prestige market \u2013 but still earn trophy status by being \u201cperfect\u201d.\n\nPerfection was always in the eye of the beholder and, according to Nicole Gleeson from Kay & Burton South Yarra, a trophy home did not need to appeal to everybody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a one-off \u2026 an \u2018oh my god\u2019 type of home,\u201d she said. \u201cThough it might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, it [can be a trophy] because there\u2019s not another one.\u201d\n\nMs Gleeson said Melbourne\u2019s trophy homes were found in a variety of suburbs, from Brighton to Toorak, but that location, grandeur and the quality of the architecture and finishes were common threads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that has all the bells and whistles because nothing has been left to do,\u201d Ms Gleeson said.\n\nA Perth trophy home at 20 Waylen Road, Shenton Park. William Porteous Properties International\n\nWilliam Porteous from William Porteous Properties International agreed that the definition of a trophy home differed from one buyer to the next, but said Perth trophies were usually linked by design quality, the level of luxury and the functionality.\n\nSize may not play a part either. \u201cYou can have a buyer who wants a small trophy home, on a small block \u2026 but which is very unique and beautifully designed,\u201d Mr Porteous said.\n\n\u201cYou might pay a premium for a small, very well built house over a mega mansion.\u201d\n\nHe said properties at this level in Perth varied widely in sale price, as riverfront offerings sold from $6 million up to about $40 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClonara at 150 Adelaide Street East, Clayfield. Ray White New Farm\n\nIn Brisbane, where grand Queenslanders and striking contemporary homes compete at the high-end market, Christine Rudolph from Ray White New Farm said properties with significant history often entered trophy territory.\n\nIn particular, stately residences that rarely changed hands and those that had been held by a prominent family typically made the grade. She pointed to Clonara in Clayfield as an example, once owned by Australian of the Year Sir Edward Williams and an early example of Queensland architecture.\n\nTidemark at 45-51 Albatross Avenue, Mermaid Beach. Domain.com.au\n\nMs Rudolph said the house set a suburb record at $7 million when it sold last year.\n\nFurther south on the Gold Coast, Eddie Wardale from Kollosche said trophy homes were most typically defined by their architectural flair in enclaves such as Mermaid Beach and the Sovereign Islands.\n\nAlong with the locale, Gold Coast trophy buyers wanted a residence that set a benchmark for luxury living, Mr Wardale said, as many coastal offerings fetched prices of $15 million or more.\n\nMr Wardale said Tidemark on Mermaid Beach\u2019s Albatross Avenue was a shining example, a Bayden Goddard-designed masterpiece that exchanged in 2016 for $25 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTree-lined Victoria Avenue in Unley Park, one of the most coveted residential streets in Adelaide. iStock\n\nIn Adelaide, what defined a trophy home was simple. According to John Williams from Harcourts Williams, buyers wanted everything, including a blend of period character and contemporary renovations, proximity to elite schools and cosmopolitan precincts, and design that needed nothing further.\n\n\u201c[Buyers] want it to be perfect in every regard, and obviously it can\u2019t become dated,\u201d Mr Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be done really, really well, and the people looking for that kind of property can tell the difference.\u201d\n\nSweeping water views do not hold the same status in Adelaide as they do in Sydney, as grand homes near the CBD are preferred and streets such as Victoria Avenue in Unley Park are highly desired.\n\nMr Williams said buyers would probably be paying at least $4 million for a trophy home in the city.\n\nThis story first appeared at Domain.\n\ndomain.com.au", "description": "Trophy homes may be different in architectural style, interior design, location and price tag, but what ties them together is an X-factor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_67/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3d3fd9fc68df1abb08c121475ac7e0f944816a1e", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
