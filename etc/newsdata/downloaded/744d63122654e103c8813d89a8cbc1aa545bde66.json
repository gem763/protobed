The new agreements would include a heavy emphasis on reducing the vandalism and theft that is \"bedevilling our infrastructure\".\n\nSaid Mbalula: \"A strong technology rollout is underway, in the form of CCTV, and other surveillance equipment. These are aimed to act as force multipliers to assist in areas where physical security cannot reach.\"\n\nThe minister also launched the so-called \"War Room\" in August - a tool to track the progress of the entire plan to modernise and improve South Africa's railways.\n\nThe War Room, housed in Prasa's offices, will be the \"game changer\", Mbalula said.\n\n\"The War Room is a physical space that will enable those deployed to the War Room to make rapid decisions based on the information they gather from the operations on the ground, on an hour by hour basis.\"\n\nThe War Room will track service recovery, safety management, the modernisation programme as well as organisational and operation progress, he said at the time.", "description": "A man believed to have been stealing cables on Cape Town's railway line between Nyanga and Philippi has been electrocuted, police say.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9358/e8bd352d98d14d039106a086df194f6a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
