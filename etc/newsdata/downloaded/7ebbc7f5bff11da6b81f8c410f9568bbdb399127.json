As Trysta Krick details, Washington is brink while the Astros are one game away from a classic comeback. USA TODAY\n\nThe Houston Astros are one game away from winning the World Series, something that would be costly for New Jersey sports books \u2014 largely due to one bettor who doesn't even live here but has wagered around $4 million on the Astros winning it all.\n\nJim \"Mattress Mack\" McIngvale has been making headlines back in his home state of Texas for the large bets he has been placing on the Astros to win it all. The furniture mogul who owns three Gallery Furniture stores in Houston is offering a promotion to his customers where he would give full refunds up to $3,000 if the Astros win.\n\n\"I believe in the Astros,'' McIngvale told the Asbury Park Press. \"I've watched them play all year.\"\n\nThe bets are in part a hedge against the cost of the promotion, said Darren Rovell, a sports business analyst and betting expert who works for Action Network.\n\nThe Astros lead the best-of-seven World Series 3-2 heading into Tuesday night's game against the Washington Nationals.\n\nMcIngvale had a similar promotion at the furniture stores in 2017, when the Astros defeated the Dodgers in the World Series. He lost $13 million in sales on the promotion.\n\n\"I think he's doing this seriously,\" Rovell said. Adding, \"he's in a tough position because of this promotion.\"\n\nFREE AGENT SERIES: MLB's top free agents on display in the World Series \u2013 and they all have the same agent\n\nCIRCLE OF TRUST: Can Nats' small group of pitchers see things through in World Series?\n\nAstros celebrate after beating the Nationals in Game 5 of the World Series.

In that time, McIngvale profited $889,212 from single-game bets, mostly from New Jersey sports books Unibet and William Hill.\n\nHis liability on the promotion is nearly $20 million, according to Rovell. Since he did not get insurance on the promotion, he is placing large bets to offset the damage if the Astros win.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how much McIngvale has on the books with New Jersey operators but it's been estimated at $4 million, wagers that would net him almost $6 million.\n\nWhen asked if he has ever seen anything else like this in sports betting, Rovell said the only one he could think of is bettor known as \"Duffle Bag Boy\" who allegedly flies to Las Vegas with duffle bags of cash to bet against the Rutgers football team.\n\nMcIngvale placed his first bet on Oct. 1 with DraftKings in Mississippi, where he wagered $3.5 million. DraftKings operates in multiple states, including New Jersey. The next day, he bet $1.5 million with FanDuel in New Jersey. He also has around $1.1 million in pending bets with Unibet and $300,000 pending with William Hill.\n\nFanDuel's Trade Director John Sheeran said the $1.5 million dollar wager that McIngvale made through the FanDuel app is the \"biggest bet in the history of sports betting\" in New Jersey as well as the biggest online bet ever placed.\n\nWhen the Houston Astros went down in the series 2-0, McIngvale flew into the Teterboro airport hanger and placed around $1 million more in bets.\n\nHe traveled here because New Jersey's sports betting law requires bettors to be physically present in the state.\n\nTwo of the bets, totaling $650,000, were on the Astros to win game three of the series, which they did and he profited around $450,000.\n\nAfter going back to Houston Friday night and watching the Astros beat the Nats in person, he flew back to New Jersey Saturday to bet $300,000 on Game 4 of the World Series with the William Hill sports book, according to Action Network. The Astros won and he netted $300,000.\n\nWhy New Jersey\n\nWhen people think gambling, they think Las Vegas, so one could figure that would be the natural place for McIngvale to go to place his World Series bets. But, the reality, McIngvale said, is \"New Jersey takes more (higher bets).\"\n\nOne of the complicating factors, according to Rovell, is that there is not a lot of people betting on the Nationals, so there is not that much balance to offset McIngvale's massive bets. \"He's challenging people to take his money.\"\n\nAnother reason McIngvale has chosen New Jersey is because he has more value to the books here, Rovell speculated.\n\n\"It just provides competition for Vegas and I think Jersey has more wants because there is more competition within Jersey because there are so many apps, so I think he has more value to the books in Jersey.\"", "description": "'Mattress Mack' is offering a promotion to his customers will he will give full refunds up to $3K if Astros win.
