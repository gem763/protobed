Mickey Callaway was fired by the Mets on Oct. 3 after two seasons as their manager.\n\nOther reported candidates are former New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi, ex-major league outfielder Carlos Beltran, Minnesota Twins bench coach Derek Shelton, Arizona Diamondbacks director of player development Mike Bell and Mets quality control coach Luis Rojas.\n\nDuring his 13-year career in the majors, mostly as a first baseman, outfielder or designated hitter, Perez, 50, played for the California Angels (1993-95), Cincinnati Reds (1996-98), St. Louis Cardinals (1999-2000, 2002-03), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2004-05), Cleveland Indians (2006) and Seattle Mariners (2006).\n\n\u2014Former Philadelphia Phillies manager Gabe Kapler is drawing interest from a number of major league teams, the latest being the Chicago Cubs, who said they plan to interview him and Houston Astros bench coach Joe Espada this week for their open position.\n\nKapler was a member of the Boston Red Sox from 2003-06 at the same time current Cubs executives Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer held similar positions with the American League club.\n\nKapler, 44, was fired Thursday after compiling a 161-163 record with no playoff appearances in two seasons with the Phillies. On Saturday, MLB Network reported that the San Francisco Giants want to interview Kapler as a possible candidate to fill Bruce Bochy\u2019s vacant managerial position.\n\n\u2014Rick Honeycutt is out as Los Angeles Dodgers pitching coach after 14 seasons and will be replaced by bullpen coach Mark Prior, president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said.\n\nFriedman told reporters Honeycutt will remain with the organization as a special assistant.\n\nThe switch came following the Dodgers\u2019 loss in the National League Division Series to the Washington Nationals after Los Angeles won a franchise-record 106 games during the regular season. It was the club\u2019s seventh straight playoff appearance, with no World Series titles during that span.\n\n\u2014Victor Robles returned from a hamstring injury to start in center field Monday night for the Washington Nationals as they hosted the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of the National League Championship Series. The Nationals began the night with a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nRobles, who was batting eighth, singled to lead off the third inning and scored the game\u2019s first run on a two-out single by Adam Eaton.\n\nThe 22-year-old Robles, who batted .255 with 17 homers, 65 RBIs and 28 steals in 155 games this season, has missed five straight postseason games since suffering the injury in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "The New York Mets are considering ESPN analyst Eduardo Perez in their managerial search, according to SNY.tv, which reported he was in New York on Monday for a second interview.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440917615&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E01N-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
