McNair High School in Atlanta were enjoying homecoming pep rally performances on Friday when the chaos erupted.\n\nA teacher reportedly invited a local rapper named Lil Tripp to the pep rally without notifying or clearing it with school officials.\n\nThe rapper, whose legal name has not been released, was performing in the school's gym when he began to drop cash on the floor, according to WSBTV.\n\nAtlanta rapper Lil Tripp (pictured) caused chaos during a high school pep rally when he began to throw money on the ground and students rushed the floor\n\nThis prompted students to rush the floor and surround Lil Tripp. The incident was captured on a cellphone.\n\nThe rapper allegedly punched one student in the face during the incident.\n\nSchool officials have since opened an investigation into the matter and say the teacher who invited Lil Tripp may be disciplined.\n\nOfficials said: 'School administrators were not aware that a McNair High School teacher invited the rapper. He was not hired by the school and did not receive compensation.'\n\nAtlanta authorities allege that Lil Tripp punched one student in the face during the incident (pictured) and may face charges\n\nBefore the altercations began, students rushed the gym floor during an earlier performance by a McNair High School sophomore who also threw money (pictured)\n\n'The school's normal security plan was in place, and includes all staff assigned to locations in the gym and at entry and exit points. Any disciplinary action would be handled as a personnel matter.'\n\nTravis Victrum, a sophomore at McNair High School who performed before Lil Tripp, told CBS46 that he saw the rapper 'throw punches' at students.\n\nVictrum was reportedly given permission by school officials to perform a rap song during the pep rally.\n\nHe and his friends decided to throw money in the air during their song, but say fighting didn't happen when they performing.\n\nVictrum said: 'All the money we threw was picked up and everybody was back seated until the other rapper came and supposedly was flashing his money and throwing it on the ground.'\n\nTravis Victrum (pictured) was reportedly given permission by school officials to perform and says the fighting didn't start until Lil Tripp's performance\n\n'All the students came and rushed and tried to pick it up. The kids were picking up the money and that's when he threw punches.'\n\nDermicka Victrum, Travis Victrum's mother, said her son can be seen on video during the initial performance but was not involved in the brawl.\n\nShe said: 'From what I was told, my son got permission for his performance and his people. I didn't know they were planning on having another rapper performing. From my son's understanding somebody else brought him. Some other boys.'\n\nSchool officials say they were not aware and did not clear Lil Tripp's appearance at McNair High School's (pictured) homecoming pep rally\n\nShe says Lil Tripp is not a student at McNair High School.\n\n'I don't know how he got in the school or did he sign in at the school,' Demricka said.\n\n'I don't know how he got here or who brought him there, but I know he is not a student there.'\n\nLil Tripp could face criminal charges.", "description": "Fighting broke out at Ronald E.
