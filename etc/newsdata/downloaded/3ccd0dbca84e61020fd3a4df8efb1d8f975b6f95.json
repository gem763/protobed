Elizabeth Warren set up to police Wall Street in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nThe case is a major test of Congress\u2019 powers and the expanding regulatory state.\n\nAt issue is whether the CFPB, an \u201cindependent\u201d agency that vests its powers in a single chief who gets funding outside the usual appropriations process and is shielded from being fired by the president, is too powerful to survive scrutiny.\n\nFor Ms. Warren, architect of the CFPB, that independence was the point \u2014 she wanted a Wall Street cop who couldn\u2019t be swayed by political pressure.\n\nBut critics say the country\u2019s founders feared that kind of concentration of power in the hands of an unelected official, which is why most agencies are answerable directly to the president or, if they\u2019re independent, they have multiple commissioners or directors to spread power around.\n\nLower courts have offered conflicting rulings on the agency \u2014 including the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, where then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh led a three-judge panel in ruling the CFPB was unconstitutional, then dissented in a later ruling when the full appeals court overturned his decision and found the panel to pass muster.\n\n\u201cNo independent agency exercising substantial executive authority has ever been headed by a single person. Until now,\u201d Justice Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn a twist, the CFPB signaled it agrees with the critics and urged the Supreme Court to take up the case to rule against the agency.\n\nThe Democrat-led House has stepped into the breach, filing a brief defending the agency as proper and urging the justices to reject the case.\n\nThe Community Bankers Association said it was happy the justices will settle the CFPB\u2019s standing once and for all, but it said whatever the court does, Congress should change the structure to create a governing commission with multiple members.\n\n\u201cA sole-director calling all the shots will never provide the long-term stability consumers deserve and the well-regulated financial sector needs,\u201d said Richard Hunt, president of the association.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh\u2019s involvement in the lower-court case had some of his opponents demanded he recuse himself on the high court.\n\n\u201cJustice Kavanaugh has demonstrated bias against the CFPB on these exact issues,\u201d said Derek Martin, director of Allied Progress. \u201cJustice Kavanaugh cannot be the deciding vote to allow Donald Trump and his financial industry supporters to neuter the Bureau going forward.\u201d\n\nJustices get to decide their own recusals and there was no indication in Friday\u2019s court order that Justice Kavanaugh had withdrawn from involvement in the case. It is traditional that justices do not sit on cases that they heard while on lower courts, but the actual case that\u2019s reached the high court, while covering the same issues, has different litigants.\n\nThe CFPB was a key part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by Mr. Obama.\n\nThe agency has the power to fine financial institutions and has amassed $13 billion in penalties.\n\nBut the CFPB has been mired in controversies from the start.\n\nMs. Warren had been in line to be the first director of the agency, but Senate Republicans made clear they would have blocked her nomination.\n\nThey did block Mr. Obama\u2019s next choice, Richard Cordray, forcing Mr. Obama to use his recess appointment powers in early 2012 to force Mr. Cordray onto the CFPB anyway.\n\nThat appointment was later challenged as unconstitutional, though the Senate eventually confirmed Mr. Cordray.\n\nHe left in 2017 to attempt an ill-fated run for Ohio governor, and his bid to install a hand-picked successor was thwarted by President Trump, who sent then-Budget Director Mick Mulvaney over to the agency to act as chief.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
