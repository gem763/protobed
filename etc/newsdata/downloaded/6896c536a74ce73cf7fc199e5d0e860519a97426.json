It marked the second time in four years New York reached the second round after a 23-year stretch in which it either missed the playoffs or didn\u2019t advance past the opening round.\n\nNow, the Islanders are hoping to build off the foundation set in the first year under Trotz.\n\n\u201cThat familiarity is nice to have,\u201d forward Josh Bailey said. \u201cA lot of our group understands what\u2019s expected of us. Hopefully kick off where we finished last year, have a good start.\u201d\n\nA year ago, the Islanders were predicted by many experts to miss the playoffs for the ninth time in 12 seasons, especially after losing star center John Tavares in free agency. However, the team took advantage of timely goals and scoring chances created by Trotz\u2019s defense-oriented system.\n\nDespite that success, the Islanders have no shortage of naysayers expecting them to regress.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we really like the group we got in here,\u201d center Mathew Barzal said. \u201cWe got chemistry in the locker room, chemistry on the ice, we got a good (penalty-kill) and we got a good staff. They\u2019re going to give us a good game plan, we just got to execute it.\u201d\n\nThe one major change was in goal with Semyon Varlamov signed to replace Vezina Trophy finalist Robin Lehner, who had combined with Thomas Greiss to win the William Jennings Trophy for allowing the fewest goals in the NHL. It also gives Greiss, entering the final year of his contract, his third goalie partner in three seasons.\n\nGreiss and Lehner shared a near-even split of games during the regular season, though Lehner started all eight playoff games. Trotz has indicated he will use the same approach during this season.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll let it play out, same premise as last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the winning business, so whoever is doing the job we\u2019ll try to do that. It\u2019s getting harder and harder for a true No. 1 to play in a 70-games-per-year type of thing.\u201d\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE: G Semyon Varlamov, F Derick Brassard.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT: G Robin Lehner, F Valtteri Filppula.\n\nKEY PLAYERS: The strong team-defense approach was backed by the stellar play of Lehner and Greiss last season. The Islanders will need to replicate that success with Varlamov and Greiss between the pipes. Varlamov has been primarily a starter over his 11-year career, but last season was 20-19-9 while appearing in 49 games - his second-lowest total over the previous six years. Eberle came on strong down the stretch with five goals and an assist in the last seven regular season games, and then had four goals and five assists in the eight playoff games. Nelson thrived in Trotz\u2019s system, getting his first 50-point season (25 goals, 28 assists) in six years in the NHL, and will need to put up similar numbers. Brassard struggled while playing for three teams last season, but he could help improve the Islanders\u2018 struggling power play. Young defenseman Noah Dobson is getting a long look in training camp and would need to displace one of the top seven to crack the opening-day roster. If he doesn\u2019t, under the CBA he can\u2019t play in the AHL this season and would have to go back to juniors.\n\nOUTLOOK: The struggles in the second round against Carolina suggested a need to add a top-line scorer, but they failed to do that. With the team mostly unaltered and still motivated to improve, there\u2019s no reason to expect a regression. The Islanders won\u2019t sneak up on any teams this season, but they still have a championship-winning coaching staff and their defense creates scoring chances.\n\nPREDICTION: The Islanders led the Metropolitan Division for a big chuck of the middle of the season before finishing second at 48-27-7 - a 13-win improvement over the previous year - and 103 points. If Varlamov can return to his previous form under the tutelage of goaltending guru Mitch Korn, the Islanders should be able to contend for the top of the Metropolitan Division again.\n\n___\n\nFollow Vin Cherwoo at https://www.twiter.com/VinCherwooAP\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After the New York Islanders were swept in the second round of the playoffs, they went into the offseason uncertain how the team would look when it returned this month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vin A.
