Mr. Eisenberg, the council\u2019s top attorney, is scheduled to appear Monday. It is not immediately clear when Mr. Ellis is expected to be deposed.\n\nMr. Bolton has the potential to deliver the most explosive testimony regarding President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. He was involved in some of the key events related to the Ukraine matter, which is the centerpiece of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe longtime Republican loyalist could defend the president. But Mr. Bolton, who was fired by the president last month, may also have an ax to grind.\n\nThe White House could also try to block Mr. Bolton from testifying, as they\u2019ve done with previous witnesses.\n\nCharles Cooper, a lawyer for Mr. Bolton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Bolton did not depart the White House on good terms. The president said he fired the veteran of multiple Republican administrations, because of numerous policy disagreements.\n\nDisputing the president\u2019s claim, Mr. Bolton insisted he resigned and has since spoken out against the administration\u2019s policies.\n\nHis name has come up frequently during other witnesses\u2019 impeachment testimony. One witness quoted Mr. Bolton as disparaging Rudy Giuliani\u2019s plan to press Ukraine to find dirt on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden as a \u201cdrug deal.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have alleged Mr. Trump withheld a $400 million military aid package from Ukraine unless its leaders investigated Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter. The president has insisted there was no quid pro quo.\n\nOther witnesses have told Congress Mr. Bolton raised alarms about the administration prodding Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\nFiona Hill, a former National Security Council official who served under Mr. Bolton, testified earlier this month that he vehemently opposed a plan to have Ukraine investigate the Bidens and conspiracy theories related to the 2016 election.\n\nMs. Hill said that Mr. Bolton was so concerned after hearing the U.S. ambassador to the European Union tie a meeting between the president and his Ukraine counterpart to a Biden probe that he told her to notify White House lawyers.\n\nMr. Bolton compared the transaction to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and said Mr. Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts were \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up,\u201d Ms. Hill testified.\n\nAnother witness, Bill Taylor, the top envoy to Ukraine, told lawmakers that Mr. Bolton was \u201cso irritated\u201d that the administration sought to link a Zelensky meeting with a Biden investigation that he abruptly ended a meeting. Mr. Taylor also told National Security Staffers at the meeting, \u201cthey should have nothing to do with domestic politics.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor also testified that Mr. Bolton opposed the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with Mr. Zelensky because \u201cit would be a disaster.\u201d That phone call has accelerated the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
