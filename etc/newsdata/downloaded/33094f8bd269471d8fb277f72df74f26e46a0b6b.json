His tweets appeared to be written in response to a report by The Washington Post this week that Trump and his legal team have examined presidential powers to pardon Trump aides, family members and possibly even himself.\n\nWhile all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 22 July 2017\n\nThe Washington Post, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported on Friday that Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, who ended his tenure on Saturday, was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters with Trump adviser Jeff Sessions last year, when Sessions was a U.S. senator.\n\nSessions now leads the Justice Department as Trump\u2019s attorney general.\n\nA new INTELLIGENCELEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey\u2019s, must stop! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 22 July 2017\n\nMr Sessions claimed that he had not met with Russians and later recused himself from the Russia probe.\n\nFollowing the tweet about his power to pardon, the President embarked on a familiar tirade about Hillary Clinton emails and the sacked FBI director James Comey.\n\nHe questioned why Sessions and special counsel Robert Mueller were not investigating Comey or Clinton, for her email practices as secretary of state.\n\nSo many people are asking why isn\u2019t the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 22 July 2017\n\nMr Trump compared this with the fact his son, Donald Jr \u201copenly gave his e-mails to the media and authorities\u201d.\n\nMy son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 22 July 2017\n\nTrump Jr. and Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort have agreed to negotiate whether to be interviewed by the investigating panel.\n\nTrump Jr., Manafort and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and now one of his senior advisers, all met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016.\n\nThat meeting was held in Trump Tower in New York after the lawyer offered damaging information about Clinton.\n\nTrump himself has not been accused of any wrongdoing by federal investigators who are probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.", "description": "Donald Trump says 'US President has complete power to pardon' in a Twitter rant against Russia probe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/379589/1000x563_379589.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-23"}
