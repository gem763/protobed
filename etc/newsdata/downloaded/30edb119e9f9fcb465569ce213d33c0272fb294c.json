Just ask the Bulgarians, who spent 500 years under violent Ottoman rule. And let\u2019s not forget the Turkish genocide against the Armenians in the First World War that the Turkish state continues to vehemently deny to this day.\n\nThat\u2019s why when I heard the news that US president Donald Trump had let Turkey\u2019s Erdogan enter the Kurdish parts of northern Syria, I was deeply concerned. This is genuinely bad news.\n\nThe decision is an American betrayal of the Kurds who carried the battle against Islamic State on their shoulders. As close American allies (until recently) in the fight against this tumor, the Kurds don\u2019t deserve this, particularly after the Kurds dismantled their defenses on the border with Turkey to redirect all forces to the battle with IS fighters under the promise that the Kurds would be protected by the US against possible Turkish attacks. That's why the decision leaves Kurdish commanders absolutely puzzled at the moment.\n\nBy all means, what Erdogan has planned will not be a peaceful resettlement of Syrians \u201cgoing back home.\u201d Under the pretext of resettling refugees back in Syria \u2013 but note, in the northern Kurdish territories \u2013 Erdogan\u2019s forces are expected to wipe out chunks of the Kurdish population, fighters and civilians alike.\n\nIt is my prediction that we are witnessing the beginning of a Turkish genocide on the Kurds. Trump will be, in part, to blame. That\u2019s just not how you do foreign policy. Iveta Cherneva Human rights author\n\nErdogan has waved his finger at Kurdish fighters in Syria, more than once, calling them terrorists. Trump\u2019s decision to give Erdogan the green light to act is in a stark contrast with his previous promises and statements that the US will protect the Kurds. As recently as January this year, Trump promised to destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if they attacked the Kurds.\n\nWhat has caused this 180-degree U-turn - and if this abrupt decision is related to Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry - is anybody\u2019s guess at this point. A US withdrawal has certainly been in the cards but has so far been resisted up - until now. So, the question remains about what Turkey offered Trump at this point, in the middle of heated impeachment calls.\n\nThe US is sending allies across the Middle East \u2013 and elsewhere in the world \u2013 the wrong message, and it is clear to all \u201cwe will use you until you\u2019ve done your part and then we will throw you at the wolves.\u201d This harms American credibility in the Middle East and its global leadership at large.\n\nAnother message being read from this decision is that US foreign policy can change overnight, on a whim.\n\nIt is my prediction that we are witnessing the beginning of a Turkish genocide on the Kurds. Trump will be, in part, to blame. That\u2019s just not how you do foreign policy.\n\nIveta Cherneva\n\nIveta Cherneva is a security and human rights author who previously served at the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and worked for the US congress.\n\n____________\n\nAre you a recognised expert in your field?
