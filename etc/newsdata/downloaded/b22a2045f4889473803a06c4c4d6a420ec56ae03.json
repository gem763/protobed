(AP/Rick Scuteri)\n\nAntonio Brown\u2019s battle to recover $30 million in guaranteed money from the Oakland Raiders may have just taken a massive hit.\n\nThe Raiders submitted multiple text messages that Brown sent to team owner Mark Davis asking to be released from the team, according to ESPN\u2019s Chris Mortensen. Brown was then released on Sept. 7.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAntonio Brown's grievance to recoup some his $30 million in guaranteed money took a hit in discovery when the @Raiders submitted multiple text messages from Brown to owner Mark Davis, asking for his release, per sources. The Raiders obliged Sept. 7. \u2014 Chris Mortensen (@mortreport) October 20, 2019\n\nThe reported texts are another example of Brown attempting to get out of his contract with the Raiders before the season started, following a post on Instagram and then a YouTube video he posted that showed him celebrating his release after he finally got it.\n\nBrown\u2019s time with the Raiders was short and full of controversy. He initially suffered a foot injury due to frostbite from cryotherapy, and then went on a long-winded battle with the NFL over his old, unsafe helmet \u2014 which caused him to miss multiple practices. He then confronted Raiders general manager Mike Mayock at practice, reportedly called him a \u201ccracker\u201d and had to be held back by teammates.\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nStory continues\n\nBrown was eventually released from the Raiders and signed by the New England Patriots hours later. He played in only one game in New England, and was released after multiple sexual assault and misconduct allegations surfaced against him. He later allegedly sent an accuser threatening text messages in a group message, and included pictures of her children.\n\nThe 31-year-old has filed multiple grievances since then, against both the Patriots and Raiders, in an attempt to recoup the $30 million in guaranteed money from the Raiders and a $9 million signing bonus from the Patriots. He is also in the midst of a property damage lawsuit, in which he was accused of \u201creprehensible behavior\u201d during the deposition.\n\nWhile it\u2019s likely the Patriots will end up having to pay Brown the $9 million signing bonus, the reported text messages to Davis make the Raiders\u2019 case in that grievance even stronger.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Antonio Brown is trying to recoup $30 million in guaranteed money from the Oakland Raiders.
