A park official told the BBC on Monday that officers had been monitoring their tracks and were confident they were safe, but experts have warned that their long-term survival may be difficult as elephants rely on large herds for protection and finding food.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Six dead elephants were found at the bottom of the gushing Haew Narok waterfall\n\n\"The next mission is how to take the carcasses from the river. Six of them are still in the river and the river is very strong now,\" the official said.\n\n\"We are using rope across the river and have a lot of people helping together to retrieve the carcasses.\"\n\nEdwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, told the BBC the rescuers \"hope to get the carcasses to an area where they can lift them with a backhoe (an excavating digger) and bury them there.\"\n\n\"The decomposing bodies will be too smelly and spread of disease is a concern,\" he added.\n\nSaturday's incident is not the first of its kind at Haew Narok. A herd of eight elephants died after falling from the waterfall in 1992, in a case that brought national attention.\n\nOfficials are now seeking to prevent further incidents from happening in the future.\n\nNatural Resources and Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa has ordered the construction of a barricade to stop animals from falling into the waterfall and called for food banks to be set up around the park in an effort to prevent food scarcity which can cause animals to approach dangerous spots, according to the Bangkok Post.", "description": "Officials say the elephant carcasses risk contaminating the water if they reach a dam downstream.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_109111336_71401654_1922954617850015_1383157396922171392_o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
