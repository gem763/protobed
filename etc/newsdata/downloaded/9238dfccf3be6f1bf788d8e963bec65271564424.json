He infamously was booted out of the US Open after calling a female umpire a \u2018whore\u2019 and a \u2018cocksucker\u2019 in 2017, while he expressed his desire for a bomb to explode at Wimbledon earlier this year.\n\nFognini engaged with a fan in the stands (Picture: Amazon Prime)\n\nOn this occasion, Fognini was unhappy with being called for a foot fault by a line judge on a first serve at 30-30 in the second game of the second set and after losing the point with a shanked forehand, he spat a large volume of saliva across the court in her direction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe umpire handed him a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct for his troubles \u2013 a decision he clearly disagreed with \u2013 and he went on to be broken courtesy of a double fault.\n\nA game later, he gestured that a Khachanov supporter in the stands was crazy by pointing at his temple and offered to buy him some beer.\n\n\u2018Go drink some beer\u2026 I pay for you,\u2019 he joked before ultimately regaining his focus and breaking the Russian back.\n\nAt the change of ends, he continued to defend himself over the violation for spitting, though the chair umpire remained unmoved.\n\nIn the sixth game of the second set, he was bemused for being handed a time violation after a lengthy fumble with balls and proceeded to repead \u2018es de locos\u2019, which translates as \u2018it\u2019s crazy\u2019.\n\nFognini rowed with Murray in the previous round (Picture: TPN/Getty Images)\n\nDespite his antics, Fognini did advance to the quarter-finals after an hour and 46 minutes and will next face US Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev.\n\nMedvedev was forced to save five set points against Canada\u2019s Vasek Pospisil in the first set, before securing a 7-6 (9-7) 7-5 win.\n\nFognini is still in the hunt to join Medvedev at the ATP Finals in November, he is currently 110 points behind eighth-placed Alexander Zverev in the Race To London, although Zverev can extend that lead when he faces Russia\u2019s Andrey Rublev later on Thursday.", "description": "Fabio Fognini booked his spot in the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters with a straight sets win over Karen Khachanov, but will see his on-court behaviour brought into question once...", "authors": ["George Bellshaw"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fognini-spit-ca81_1570692379.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
