That was massive.\u201d\n\nSince suffering the stroke Sophia, who still struggles with muscle spasticity, has been on a long road to recover.\n\nDr Ganesh Bavikatte, a neurorehabilitation specialist who has treated Sophia, said: \u201cI can\u2019t really put into words the importance of post-stroke rehabilitation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, many stroke survivors do not get referred to a spasticity specialist early enough and so do not get the treatment they need leading to a diminished quality of life.\u201d\n\nSophia followed a rehabilitation plan which helped her regain use of her left arm and speech.\n\nShe was well enough to ride along with Joe to Italy in a specially-adapted motorcyle.\n\n(Image: LiverpoolEcho/ WS)\n\nSophia said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a case of gradual improvements.\n\n\"The main problems have been with my speech, and movement on my left side.\n\n\"I have got better \u2013 thanks to speech therapy and occupational therapy and exercise \u2013 but everything takes a great deal of effort and concentration.\n\n\"I use a walking stick but can only manage short distances, so I have a chair, and it doesn\u2019t take me long before I get tired.\n\n\"But I\u2019m determined to live as full a life as possible.\u201d", "description": "Sophia Dempsey, from Warrington, skipped university as she felt ill - but her condition soon worsened", "authors": ["Paddy Shennan", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Liverpoolecho", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747843.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Student-left-fighting-for-life-hours-after-telling-boyfriend-she-had-terrible-headache.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
