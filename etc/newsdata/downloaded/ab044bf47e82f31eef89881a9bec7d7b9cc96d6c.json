Reports by The Associated Press and Quartz in recent days confirmed both he and Mnuchin are among the list of attendees.\n\nAlso scheduled to attend are Tom Barrack, a top Trump fundraiser and friend, David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, and Eric Cantor, the former Republican House majority leader who now serves as an executive at Moelis & Co., according to a guest list reviewed by The Washington Post. Senior executives from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and BlackRock are also expected to attend.\n\nMany of these same guests, including Mnuchin, dropped out of last year\u2019s conference in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nKhashoggi disappeared on Oct. 2, 2018, after entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to obtain a marriage document. He was a U.S. resident and a contributor to the Post at the time and had long been a critic of the Saudi royal government.\n\nFoul play was immediately suspected in his disappearance, though Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman insisted he had played no role in the journalist\u2019s murder.\n\nA United Nations special rapporteur in June concluded that Khashoggi had been the \u201cvictim of a deliberate, premeditated execution\u201d and said there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d the crown prince had ordered the killing. The CIA came to a similar conclusion in November.\n\nBoth Kushner and Trump have defended the crown prince, largely because they say Saudi Arabia is a vital ally and a key trading partner for oil.\n\nAs in previous years, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. is scheduled to host the Riyadh gathering next week in spite of numerous reports that the Saudi government has utilized its hotels to perpetrate human rights abuses. In 2017, the government imprisoned hundreds of rich Saudis in a supposed anti-corruption campaign while the crown prince consolidated power.\n\nAt least a dozen people were hospitalized after being tortured and physically abused during their stay at the Ritz. One Saudi military officer detained at the hotel later died in custody, according to The New York Times.", "description": "The Treasury secretary backed out last year amid controversy surrounding the Saudi journalist's disappearance.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dae5259200000571c50659f.jpeg?cache=e7d1mog3r4&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
