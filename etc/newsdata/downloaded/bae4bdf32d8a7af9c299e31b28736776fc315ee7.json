Oilier complexions can go from matte to flat in the blink of an eye with too much of the wrong product, but when subjected to the elements without any powder at all, even the best make-up can look amateurish.\n\nPowder is the final ingredient in the recipe for perfect skin 24/7, hence the difficulty with finding the perfect one.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking to simply lock your make-up into place or keep the oil at bay, the same pressures apply to finding the right powder as they do to any skincare product.\n\nCertain skin types are averse to powders, which can dry out your skin or emphasise fine lines and wrinkles. On the other hand, it can also settle into greasy spots and react negatively to the rest of your make-up, leaving your painstakingly-applied layers cakey.\n\nWhen it came to finding our top choice, we prioritised powders that smoothed over our complexion and helped prolong our make-up.\n\nWe also wanted to find the product that was smoothest to apply. Each of our favourites were tested on everyday and evening looks, through a series of environmental factors \u2013 whether that\u2019s rain, sun, the gym or even a night out.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nHuda Beauty easy bake loose powder: \u00a328, Cult Beauty\n\nHuda Beauty founder Huda Kattan is the queen of baking, so it\u2019s no surprise that the brand has perfected the recipe behind it. The easy bake powder does what it says on the tin, sitting on the skin like silk to absorb any excess oil and brighten up the undereye area.\n\nThe tiniest amount will also set make-up all over, as well as blurring the appearance of pores \u2013 all without causing the dreaded photograph flashback. It\u2019s non-comedogenic, meaning it won\u2019t block your pores or cause a breakout, and (added bonus) smells amazing.\n\nWe found this powder to be the longest lasting of all those tested, keeping several layers of product in place through nights out, rainy weather and even a quick workout. Our make-up had never received so many compliments before, earning this product a spot in our everyday beauty routine.\n\nBuy now\n\nMarc Jacobs finish line perfecting coconut setting powder: \u00a332, Harvey Nichols\n\nNearly the whole complexion line of Marc Jacobs\u2019 make-up range is infused with coconut water, but this powder goes a step further and incorporates five different forms of coconut: alkanes, milk, water, polysaccharides and fragrance. While it may sound excessive, the results speak for themselves. Our tester loved the unique finish of this powder, with skin left healthy, airbrushed and glowing rather than matte and flat, and the tiniest amount goes a long way.\n\nBuy now\n\nFenty pro filt'r instant retouch setting powder: \u00a324, Boots\n\nAs if the packaging wasn\u2019t luxe enough, this powder made our tester\u2019s make-up look that little bit more professional. The powder is very fine, meaning there\u2019s no risk of a cakey or lifeless finish. While it pairs best with the Fenty foundation, we loved how versatile this was with a whole range of face products. However, those with oilier skin will find that you need to touch this up throughout the day.\n\nBuy now\n\nIT Cosmetics bye bye breakout powder: \u00a326.50, Cult Beauty\n\nIT Cosmetics' range was formulated by a former news presenter on the hunt for make-up that could hold its own in front of the cameras. The end result is a line of skin-perfecting cult make-up classics that don\u2019t compromise the health of your complexion. This version of IT Cosmetics\u2019 powder is a hybrid of a finishing powder and spot treatment. While a lot of powders only emphasise the irregular texture of a breakout, this product works to reduce it in the long-term, decreasing redness and oiliness as well as preventing further inflammation. We found that on top of its skincare benefits it provided good coverage, but is extremely limited in its shade range, offering only three options.\n\nBuy now\n\nSoap and Glory one heck of a blot powder: \u00a312, Boots\n\nIf you suffer from skin so oily that no powder seems to do the job, this is definitely the choice for you. The main goal of this powder is to absorb any excess oil and leave skin less of a slick, shiny mess and more a velvety canvas for additional make-up. Pressed powder is tricky to master, but this formula applies smoothly and sets make-up in place for hours on end. While it\u2019s translucent, we found that it works best for those with yellow undertones in their complexion.\n\nBuy now\n\nHourglass veil translucent setting powder: \u00a342, Space NK\n\nThis is a pricey addition to your make-up routine, but definitely worth the investment. A lot of translucent powders can actually appear white on the skin or cause drastic flashback in photographs, but once applied, this powder is truly invisible. Skin doesn\u2019t feel dried out or cakey, and the formula is so light that it doesn\u2019t settle into fine lines. Although it does set make-up in place for the rest of the day, we found that it wasn\u2019t quite on par with some of its competitors when it came to controlling oil.\n\nBuy now\n\nCharlotte Tilbury Charlotte's genius loose powder: \u00a333, John Lewis & Partners\n\nCharlotte Tilbury make-up is glamorous from the packaging to the contents and this powder is no exception. Lightweight and infused with amino acids, skin immediately looks brighter after application. Those with oilier skin might not find it mattifying enough, but we loved how it illuminated the undereye area.\n\nBuy now\n\nBeauty Bakerie flour setting powder: \u00a322.50, Cult Beauty\n\nAs if the brand\u2019s bakery-esque packaging wasn\u2019t enough, we immediately fell in love with the finely milled texture of this setting powder. It quite literally applies like flour to the face, packing easily under the eyes and working as the ideal baking component in the T-zone. When dusted across the entire face, it also seamlessly blurs pores and transforms a good foundation to an amazing, long-lasting one.\n\nBuy now\n\nNYX Professional Makeup can\u2019t stop won\u2019t stop setting powder: \u00a312, Superdrug\n\nSmooth and light, this powder is more than just a budget-friendly option. It\u2019s available in six shades, setting make-up without clumping in oily spots. If we had just one issue it would be the packaging \u2013 it can be tricky to disperse the right amount of product onto your brush \u2013 but the pros vastly outweigh the cons, and we can\u2019t argue with the price tag.\n\nBuy now\n\nMilk Makeup blur + set matte loose setting powder: \u00a325.50, Cult Beauty\n\nOur tester had never used a product that made her face feel so soft before trying Milk\u2019s blur + set. Powders can be drying and harsh, but the use of hyaluronic acid and avocado powder here helps smooth out the complexion while also keeping your make-up exactly where you want it to be. It feels too fine to brighten up dark or uneven patches of skin, but is enough to illuminate your face overall.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Face powders\n\nFor the best overall option, you can\u2019t go wrong with Huda\u2019s easy bake loose powder, which bakes and sets like a dream. However, if you\u2019re specifically looking to use powder to absorb excess oil, we would recommend Fenty\u2019s pro filt'r instant retouch setting powder or the Soap and Glory one heck of a blot powder.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
