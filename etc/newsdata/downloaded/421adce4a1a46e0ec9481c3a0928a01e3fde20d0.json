In total, the fund has 135 holdings which Henderson says helps protect the trust\u2019s income if one or two holdings cut their dividends.\n\nAlthough Henderson admits further uncertainty over Brexit could impact negatively on both the value of sterling and the UK stock market \u2013 and by implication the trust\u2019s assets \u2013 he is not unduly worried.\n\nIndeed, if the market weakens, he says he will increase the trust\u2019s borrowings so that he can buy more equity exposure on the \u2018cheap\u2019.\n\nFor the past 17 years, the man in charge of managing Law Debenture is James Henderson\n\nHe believes shares in companies such as claims management specialist Redde and logistics giant Stobart have been sold down too sharply and at some stage should come good again. He has also built a stake in Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\nHenderson adds: \u2018I\u2019m gently taking profits from the trust\u2019s successful investments in American companies such as Microsoft and Applied Materials \u2013 and investing into the UK stock market which remains cheap.\n\n'It\u2019s a slow and gentle process and it may not look good for us if a Brexit deal is not struck by new Prime Minister Boris Johnson by the end of October. But at the end of the day, I don\u2019t try to be a politician. It\u2019s the quality of the companies and management I invest in that are crucial.\u2019\n\nJames Henderson also manages investment trusts Lowland and Henderson Opportunities that are both invested in the UK stock market.\n\nHe says Law Debenture is lower risk because of its greater exposure to FTSE 100 listed companies. The trust\u2019s annual ongoing charge is also more competitive at 0.43 per cent.\n\nThis compares with 0.57 per cent and 0.84 per cent for Lowland and Henderson Opportunities respectively.\n\nOver the past five years, Law Debenture has generated a modest total return of 34 per cent for investors. This compares with a 36 per cent return from the FTSE All-Share Index.\n\nThe trust has more than a year\u2019s income stashed away in reserve which should send out a reassuring signal to anyone wishing to buy shares for the future dividends it will pay.", "description": "Although its name gives little away, Law Debenture attempts to deliver a mix of capital and income growth for shareholders by investing in the UK stock market.", "authors": ["Jeff Prestridge For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
