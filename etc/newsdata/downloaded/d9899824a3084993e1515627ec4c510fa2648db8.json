(Image: Paramount Pictures)\n\n\u201cIs that still happening?\u201d you ask. We, uh, we think so?\n\nIndiana Jones 5, which was initially slated for next year before being pushed back to 2021, is a movie that may or may not be happening, that we\u2019ve had precious little news come out of even though all the principal players \u2014 Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg \u2014 insist they\u2019re absolutely committed to seeing it through.\n\nLast we heard, the script was being reworked by Dan Fogelman (This Is Us), who inherited the project from Jonathan Kasdan, who himself took it on from David Koepp. Now, according to Den of Geek, Koepp is \u2014 back on it?\n\nThat\u2019s what Koepp himself said during an interview to the publication, anyways, commenting, \u201cI\u2019m working on it again. We\u2019re still trying. I think we\u2019ve got a good idea this time. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly promising? But it does mean that the project is still ongoing, though stuck in the writing stage. After The Crystal Skull (which Koepp wrote), it\u2019s good they\u2019re taking it slow. But who knows when they\u2019ll get something to make a movie around.", "description": "\u201cIs that still happening?\u201d you ask.
