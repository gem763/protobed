So I guess we can forgive James Forsyth, the Spectator\u2019s political editor, for his hyperbolic claim last week that he had been the recipient of \u201cthe most explosive Downing Street memo in modern times\u201d.\n\nIn fairness, it was hugely interesting, and not just for its content. It was a rare example of a supposedly confidential source being cavalier about his own identity. Step forward Dominic Cummings, special adviser to Boris Johnson. Allegedly? No, for sure.\n\nEventually, despite a measure of initial reticence, several newspapers felt confident enough to name him.\n\nThis episode was further proof that Brexit is changing Britain\u2019s political and journalistic culture. It certainly merits the description as the most explosive political event since \u2026 well, since any living politician and living political journalist can remember. Quite simply, there has been nothing like it in the collective experience of Westminster and Fleet Street.\n\nDominic Cummings accused of conflict of interest over NHS fund Read more\n\nLet\u2019s deal first with the significance of the memo\u2019s eye-popping content.\n\nCummings was detailing the government\u2019s game plan should it be necessary to extend the Brexit deadline still further. In that event, to quote the Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff, No 10 was, in effect, \u201cthreatening almighty vengeance\u201d.\n\nAside from providing a delighted Forsyth with an intimate view of the state of the negotiations, it not only revealed No 10\u2019s strategy but also its frustration over the failure to achieve its primary objective to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October.\n\nThen came the pushback, the threat of a drama to come. Cummings wrote of \u201clegal advice\u201d that means \u201cwe can do all sorts of things to scupper delay which for obvious reasons we aren\u2019t going into details about\u201d.\n\nWe must presume Cummings\u2019s \u201cleak\u201d was intended as a message to MPs from all parties and, possibly, Ireland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, along with EU leaders in Brussels. But what was striking was his flagrancy. It was as if he wanted to be recognised as the author. Here was a man, blandly described in time-honoured fashion by Forsyth as \u201ca contact in No 10\u201d, virtually outing himself as the source.\n\nThis was so unusual that, in spite of political journalists knowing his identity, several felt constrained from saying so. Instead, their reports referred to him with the usual range of indirect terms: \u201ca No 10 source\u201d (the Times and Daily Express); \u201ca senior government source\u201d (Daily Mail); and \u201caides\u201d (the Sun, pluralising an individual).\n\nOthers were less inhibited. The Daily Telegraph referred to \u201ca memo widely believed to be a text sent by Dominic Cummings\u201d. The Guardian was a little more guarded. It reported that Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, had \u201cissued a rebuke to the person who briefed anonymously to the Spectator, believed to be the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings\u201d.\n\nMemo from 'No 10 contact' seen as fresh play in blame game Read more\n\nSimon Walters, in the Mail, did not hold back. He wrote: \u201cThe Downing Street \u2018source\u2019 quoted by the Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson\u2019s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings.\u201d While that sentence could be said to reflect Walters\u2019s personal animosity towards Cummings, I tend to think it speaks volumes about the changing political viewpoint of the Mail itself. There\u2019s a story in the making.\n\nBack to Cummings. Whatever one thinks of him, there is something wonderfully refreshing about his way of going about his business. His memo to Forsyth is part of a pattern. He has not concealed his fingerprints on a number of previous leaks from No 10, especially in the lead-up to the supreme court ruling against the prorogation of parliament.\n\nNot for Cummings the usual backroom role of an adviser. No smoke and mirrors for him. He is a very public eminence grise who enjoys the limelight and, apparently, revels in the consequent notoriety. He appears determined to be his own man rather than be part of someone else\u2019s story.\n\nWhether or not this is bad for the country \u2013 we shall see \u2013 it cannot be denied it\u2019s rather good for our trade. We thrive on colourful characters courting controversy. Journalism is often the beneficiary of big egos in the sense that, in promoting themselves, they inevitably provide stories. One problem for Cummings is how he deals with journalists in the coming weeks. Can he hope to brief on an entirely confidential basis? With this and other lengthy examples of his writing style in the public domain, it\u2019s impossible to conceal his authorship. Then again, he obviously doesn\u2019t want to be anonymous.\n\nIt is unlikely that the Cummings way will lead to a change in how political journalists obtain their information. Down the years there has often been criticism about the cosiness of the lobby system and the opacity of Westminster and Whitehall sources. But it\u2019s a necessity. Off-the-record conversations allow information to reach the public domain that would otherwise remain secret.\n\nNor, as some critics believe, is it a system widely open to abuse. Reporters working in a competitive media environment police each other by checking on the truth of an opponent\u2019s story. Indeed, when scoops occur, one of the more unedifying practices is the hunt for the source by rivals. Although one\u2019s own confidential sources must be respected, other people\u2019s are not.\n\nMost of the time, the system of unattributable briefings is uncontroversial and, in such circumstances, single sourcing is also accepted as the norm. No one can conceive of doing it differently. Even in the US, where a culture of openness contrasts with Britain\u2019s more secretive climate, journalists rely on \u201cdeep background\u201d to flesh out their stories. Politics thrives on concealment of some kind.\n\nSo, in spite of the darkness of his message, let me applaud Cummings, the messenger who has stepped out of the shadows. We may not have him for long, of course, but let\u2019s enjoy him while we can.", "description": "The outspoken adviser couldn\u2019t care less about being revealed as the source of a \u2018leak\u2019", "authors": ["Roy Greenslade"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b9390ffdec7f6981af7819af89d758f4161528c/0_9_1691_1015/master/1691.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=30985145e9cb16e2850706429b685bce", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
