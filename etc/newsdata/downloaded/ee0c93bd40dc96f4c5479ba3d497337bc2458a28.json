But when he yanked the steering wheel to put the bus back onto the road, the momentum sent the bus into a rollover crash, authorities said.\n\nThe driver, an American citizen, survived and was talking with investigators, Mr Street said. He didn\u2019t appear to be intoxicated, but authorities were still investigating his condition as well as any possible mechanical problems, he said.\n\nThere was some wind, but it was not strong enough to cause problems, Mr Street said.\n\nThe crash left the top of a white bus smashed in and one side peeling away as the vehicle came to rest mostly off the side of the road against a sign for restrooms.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to investigate.\n\nThe company listed on the bus was America Shengjia Inc.
