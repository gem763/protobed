We are saying that... by giving them the death penalty, they will lose the opportunity to do something good with their lives,\" lawyer Nadthasiri Bergman said.\n\nShe joined the mothers of the two men, and Myanmar embassy officials, to submit the request at the sprawling Bangkok prison where they are being held.\n\n\"They deserve a second chance,\" she added.\n\nIn the request Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun have pleaded for \"compassion from the king,\" Andy Hall, advisor to the legal defence team, added.\n\nThe original verdicts on the 2014 double killing divided relatives of the victims.\n\nMiller's parents backed the court's decision, but the family of Witheridge were more cautious, with her sister saying she believed the investigation had been \"bungled\".\n\nThe case has triggered a strong reaction from Myanmar, where many felt the two men had been given an unfair trial as low-paid migrant workers -- an integral part of Thailand's workforce -- are often regarded with contempt by its public.\n\nThe police were accused of buckling under pressure to solve a crime that attracted global attention.\n\nZaw Lin's brother who was working alongside him in Thailand at the time of the murder said earlier this month that the two were simply used as \"scapegoats\" to save Thailand's image.\n\n\"Hearing the judge give him (Zaw Lin) the death sentence was horrific,\" Maung Zaw Win told AFP at their family home in western Rakhine State -- one of Myanmar's most impoverished.\n\n\"I ask the Thai King to show kindness to them, to show them humanity,\" he added.\n\nIt is unclear when the sentence will be carried out, with hundreds remaining on death row.\n\nBut last year Thailand carried out its first execution since 2009, prompting criticism by rights groups who had hoped the country was moving towards abolishing the practice.\n\nburs-dhc/apj/kaf", "description": "The mothers of two Myanmar men sentenced to death for the murder of a pair of British backpackers in Thailand submitted a plea for clemency from the Thai king Thursday, in a case tainted by claims of irregularities.
