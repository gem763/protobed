(Screenshot: Kevin Klauer, Twitter)\n\nGood night, sweet prince: An out of control, apparently furious and driverless catering cart that was spinning in wild circles on the tarmac of Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport (ORD) on Tuesday was laid to its final rest by a quick-witted worker who prevented it from hitting a plane by slamming into it with another vehicle.\n\nAmerican Osteopathic Association chief executive Kevin Klauer uploaded video of the incident to Twitter (where it has racked up over three million views and counting). Nearby groundcrew can be seen rushing to the spinning catering cart as it spewed loose pallets of beverages and only barely avoided running over a nearby worker. Said groundcrew then seem to realise there is little they can do but get the hell out of the way; the cart is seen getting closer and closer to a nearby jet before a worker in another ground support vehicle subjects it to the Battlebots treatment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you do it!\u201d someone yells in the video as travellers cheer.\n\nCrazy event at ORD.
