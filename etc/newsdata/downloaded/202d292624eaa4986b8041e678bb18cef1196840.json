But the unrest also involved riots, arson and looting that have wracked Chile for six days, nearly paralysing a country long seen as an oasis of stability.\n\n\"Today we're protesting all of our discontent against these politicians who have been fooling us. The raise in the subway fare was just the straw that broke the camel's back,\" said Italo Tarsetti, a taekwondo teacher standing among demonstrators honking horns and banging on pots, a common form of protest in Latin America.\n\nFaced with the mounting unrest, Pi\u00f1era on Tuesday night (Wednesday AEDT) announced economic reforms that include increases in the minimum wage and lowest state pensions. But many said the 69-year-old billionaire businessman reacted late and the announcement failed to calm anger in the streets.\n\n\"These measures are absurd. It's handing out crumbs to the people,\" said Magdalena Bravo, a demonstrator who said she had lost her job as a school teacher.\n\n\"There are many reasons why I have joined there protests,\" she said. \"The inequality is tremendous. There are families of five, six people living with miserable salaries.\"\n\nThe protests have divided Chileans. Many want a reduction of Chile's sharp inequality, a wider distribution of its copper wealth and major changes in taxes and education reform, but they condemn the destruction.\n\n\"You don't know what can happen to you,\" said retiree Magaly Munoz. \"I understand that people are dissatisfied, but they can't break into your home and loot businesses. I can't support that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuman rights groups expressed concerns about how security forces have handled the protests after the government declared a state of emergency and a curfew in some areas of the country. It was the first such state of emergency - other than for natural disasters - imposed since Chile returned to democracy in 1990 following a bloody 17-year dictatorship.\n\n\"We're worried,\" Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, told The Associated Press. \"The images that we've received from credible sources, trustworthy sources, show that there has been an excess of force both by police as well as some soldiers.\"\n\nAbout 20,000 soldiers are patrolling the streets, nearly 200 people have been injured and some 5000 have been arrested.\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also criticised what it said is excessive use of force by security forces as well as the \"violent acts committed by civilians\" in the protests. It called for dialogue to hear \"people's legitimate demands\".\n\nLawmaker Camila Vallejo, a former leader in mass student protests demanding free education, joined a march to Congress calling for authorities to lift a curfew being enforced by the military.\n\nFor many people, the sight of soldiers on the streets brings back bad memories of General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, when about 40,000 people were killed, tortured or imprisoned for political reasons.\n\nStill, many have defied the curfew.\n\n\"People are no longer afraid to face the military. They lost the fear,\" said Angelica Salazar, who works at a pizzeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the protests erupted, Pi\u00f1era declared a state of emergency and rolled back the subway hike.\n\nHe said Chile is \"at war,\" but took a more conciliatory tone after being criticised for the comment. He also has apologised for the failures of his and previous governments on the left and right to curb inequality.\n\nThe economic agenda he announced calls for increasing the lowest monthly pensions from $US151 to $US181, raising the monthly minimum wage from $US413 to $US481 and rescinding a 92 per cent rise in electricity rates scheduled to take effect next month. It would also increase taxes for anyone earning more than $US11,000 ($16,000) a month.\n\nMany Chileans feel left out of the country's economic gains. Education and medicines are costly, water has been privatised since the dictatorship, state pensions are low and many families live on just $US550 to $US700 a month in earnings.\n\nAAP", "description": "An apology and promises of economic reform from Chilean President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era has failed to calm unrest and rioting that has led to at least 18 deaths.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3027%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0f74fbfd84ea174224981c6393d5cd0506f1a83f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
