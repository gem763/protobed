REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo\n\nPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said the police request, which follows a series of bomb blasts in Bangkok in August that were blamed on Muslim suspects, was needed to build a national security database.\n\nAn official letter from police, shared online by former rights commissioner Angkhana Neelapaijit, asked a university to supply information about the numbers, place of origin, sect affiliation and other details about Muslim-organised student groups. The name of the university was blotted out.\n\n\u201cThis is an interference to personal rights and a discrimination based on religion,\u201d Angkhana said, adding that freedom of religion and the right to privacy were guaranteed by the Thai constitution.\n\nAbout 90% of Thais are Buddhist, though Muslims are a majority in three southern provinces bordering Malaysia.\n\nPrayuth said the move was necessary.\n\n\u201cThe police has already pointed out that this is for the creation of a data base on intelligence,\u201d Prayuth said. \u201cNo rights have been breached. We cannot manage anything if we don\u2019t have data.\u201d\n\nMuslim students said the police request was discriminatory.\n\n\u201cWe want the police to reconsider this, the university should be a space where students can express their views freely and their rights are protected,\u201d Ashraf Awae, president of the Muslim Students Federation of Thailand told Reuters.\n\nA police source told Reuters the request for information on Muslims was linked to the attacks on Aug. 2 that wounded four people when six small bombs and six incendiary devices went off in Bangkok, which was hosting a major international meeting.\n\nThree persons have been arrested and 11 others wanted by the authorities are still at large. All of the suspects are Muslim Malays from southern Thailand.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about those ill-intended people who are infiltrating university students,\u201d a police source who did not wish to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media said.\n\nSimilar letters have been sent to many Thai education institutions as part of a routine update of an existing intelligence data base, the police said in a statement.\n\nSome universities with a large population of Muslim students were disturbed by the letter.\n\nWuthisak Lapcharoensap, president of Ramkhamhaeng University in Bangkok told Reuters the police should reconsider their request.\n\n\u201cI have not received the letter yet but if it comes, I would not be able to comply,\u201d Wuthisak said.\n\n(This story change quote attribution from Prayuth to police source on paragraph 12)", "description": "Thailand's prime minister on Tuesday defended police for requesting information about minority Muslim students from universities around the country, after criticism of the move as discriminatory and illegal.", "authors": ["Panarat Thepgumpanat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430824693&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0VQ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
