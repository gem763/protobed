In interviews since then, both flyweights have angled for a potential matchup down the road.\n\nDespite his opposition to Cejudo, Elliott can\u2019t deny the champion is doing an excellent job at promoting the UFC\u2019s 125-pound division. In Elliott\u2019s opinion, Cejudo\u2019s \u201cKing of Cringe\u201d ploy is elevating the flyweight division to new interest levels.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of silly, but I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s doing it,\u201d Elliott told MMA Junkie. \u201cI\u2019d prefer that he does do it. This is the entertainment game \u2013 it\u2019s not just about fighting. It doesn\u2019t matter if people love you or hate you, the tickets sell the same. The \u2018cringe\u2019 thing and people hitting him, he could either try to be something that\u2019s not or he could take this (expletive) and run with it.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing a good job of going ahead and biting the bullet. Being the cringy guy. It\u2019s going to make him money and it\u2019s going to make all of us more money. He\u2019s bringing interest to the little guys right now. As silly as it is, I love it. I think it\u2019s probably good for the sport.\u201d\n\nAt UFC on ESPN+ 19, Elliott (15-8-1 MMA, 4-6 UFC) squares off with Deiveson Figueiredo (16-1 MMA, 5-1 UFC). The event takes place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nWith a win over Figueiredo, Elliott think he\u2019ll be one or two victories away from finally squaring off with the Olympic gold medalist and UFC double champion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not \u2013 we already have history together,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nWe\u2019ve already had words back and forth. I\u2019m definitely going to (expletive) talk him, whether he stays at 135 or moves back down.\n\n\u201c\u2026 He\u2019s bringing some interest to the division. Whether you love him or hate him, people want to watch him. Same with me. I feel like I have a little bit to prove because I\u2019ve been out for so long. Two or three more fights, there\u2019s no reason why that can\u2019t be a possibility.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Elliott faces a tough task in the form of a Brazilian finisher. The contest will be Elliott\u2019s first since December of 2017, having needed time to recover from a knee injury. Confident in his abilities, Elliott believes his speed and footwork will prove to be the difference when the two step into the cage in Florida.\n\n\u201cHe has a lot of power, but he\u2019s slow for the division,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cHe looks good if you stand right in front of him and I\u2019m definitely not going to do that. He\u2019s going to have to fight my fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already paid my dues in this game and in the UFC, so he\u2019s going to have to come fight my fight. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Stylistically and physically, I feel like everything is playing out as it should.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going grind him out early. I feel like I\u2019m going to pressure him the first two rounds pretty hard and make him quit.\u201d", "description": "UFC flyweight Tim Elliott isn't the biggest fan Henry Cejudo, but he gives the champion credit where credit is due.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Simon Head", "Ken Hathaway", "Matt Erickson", "Farah Hannoun", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/tim-elliott-mark-de-la-rosa.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
