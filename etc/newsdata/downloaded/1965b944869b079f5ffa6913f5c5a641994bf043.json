I'm Alexei Oreskovic, Business Insider's West Coast Bureau Chief and Global Tech Editor.\n\nIf you're not yet a subscriber to Trending, BI Prime's tech newsletter, you can sign up here.\n\nThis week: Masa is doubling down for Season 2 of the WeWork drama\n\nSeason 1 of the WeWork series wrapped up in dramatic fashion, as Japan's SoftBank swooped in with a $9 billion rescue package.\n\nSeason 2 is already underway and promises to be\"an amazing comeback story,\" if you believe the words of WeWork's new executive chairman, who was promptly dispatched for the assignment from SoftBank HQ.\n\nThere are new characters and plotlines, and a big unresolved question: What in the world is SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son thinking?\n\nAs Troy Wolverton writes, the decision to pump another $9 billion into WeWork seems like a classic example of doubling down on a losing bet.\n\nBut WeWork might simply be too big to fail, at least for SoftBank. The office-sharing company is one of the largest stakes held by SoftBank's venture capital fund, the Vision Fund. And some of the other big bets in the $100 billion Vision Fund, like Uber, aren't looking so great either. A collapse of WeWork could have put a devastating hole in the Vision Fund, and would almost certainly doom the Vision Fund 2 that SoftBank is still in the process of raising.\n\nThat's left Masayoshi Son, or Masa, holding a tough hand. Layoffs are looming, insiders are furious about founder Adam Neumann's golden parachute and the company is overrun with confusion. If it sounds like it would all make for a great movie, you're in luck: Business Insider announced that we're making a feature-length documentary film about WeWork, based on the reporting of BI's team of tech and finance journalists.\n\nDetails to come, but in the meantime keep following our coverage and watch out for spoilers.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nThe case for breaking up Amazon\n\nBreaking up Big Tech, whether it be Amazon, Google or Facebook, is the fashionable thing to discuss these days if you're on a debate podium with other presidential candidates.\n\nBut in the case of Amazon, the argument to split off its AWS cloud business has been a longtime favorite of Wall Street analysts. As Ashley Stewart reports, it's an item that's getting a lot of attention lately. While Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is known for not caving in to political pressure, there are other reasons to separate the cloud business, including making it easier for AWS to win retail customers who are wary of using a service provided by Amazon.\n\nAnd for shareholders, Amazon and AWS would be worth more on their own than they currently are together, according to some estimates.\n\nDon't expect Amazon executives to announce a split up when the company reports earnings results on Thursday. But from a bigger picture perspective, the chances of AWS going solo are \"incrementally\" higher than before.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nThe idea that Amazon should spin out its massively profitable cloud business keeps coming up. Here's how that might work \u2014 and why it's very unlikely\n\nStartup road trip \u2014 Destination: Austin\n\nMegan Hernbroth, who covers VCs and startups, recently went on a mission to Austin. After she was done sampling all the delicious barbecue, her assignment was to scout the Texas city's tech scene.\n\nWith San Francisco's cost-of-living surging to obscene heights, tech entrepreneurs are figuring out that it's not as vital to be in the Bay Area as it once was. That's why we've started the \"Startup Dispatch\" series: a sporadic, peripatetic project in which we'll roam across the US, reporting on up-and-coming tech hot spots.\n\nAustin was the first stop, and as Megan reports, there are startups developing everything from robots to cybersecurity, and a growing assortment of VCs ready to fund them.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nPhil Ostroff/Flickr\n\nOther recent tech highlights:\n\nAnd more from across the BI newsroom:\n\nAs always, I'm eager for your feedback, thoughts, and tips \u2014 you can email me at aoreskovic@businessinsider.com.
