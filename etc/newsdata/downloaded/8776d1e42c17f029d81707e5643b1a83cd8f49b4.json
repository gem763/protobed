Is the Labour leader going to be the mug who gives Boris Johnson an easy path to crashing out of the EU without a deal? Or will he outsmart the devilish plots of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s ruthless advisor?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the opposition backed by Tory rebels succeed in their battle this evening to gain control of the Parliamentary timetable. The idea is then to pass a law forcing Johnson to ask the EU to delay Brexit from 31 October until 30 January.\n\nLet\u2019s assume then that the prime minister tries to foil this plan by putting down a motion tomorrow to call a snap election on 14 October. The government briefed last night that this is what he would do \u2013 even though Johnson didn\u2019t actually say so in his statement outside Downing Street. The key question for Corbyn will then be whether to say \u201cyes\u201d to this snap election \u2013 because without his support there can\u2019t be one. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, two-thirds of all MPs need to vote in favour. Even abstentions don\u2019t reduce the bar, so Johnson would need 434 positive votes.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt would be a strategic error to say \u201cyes\u201d to such an election before the prime minister has secured extra time from the EU, a conclusion he appears to have accepted this morning.\n\nUnless Corbyn gets an overall majority in an election, Johnson wouldn\u2019t have to resign. Even if he doesn\u2019t himself get an overall majority, he could hang on in Downing Street until Parliament was recalled and it was clear that somebody else could form a government, according to the Cabinet Manual.

But given how the prime minister has been playing fast and loose with our constitution, including suspending Parliament for five critical weeks, it wouldn\u2019t be past him to stop it meeting until after 31 October.\n\nBy then, we would have crashed out.\n\nEven if MPs came back a few days earlier, they would still have to choose a Speaker and swear an oath. All that normally takes several days. There might not be time to form a new government, send the new prime minister to Brussels and get the extension before Halloween.\n\nThere are further advantages to Corbyn in saying \u201cno\u201d to an election until Johnson had secured extra time. Yesterday the prime minister said there were \u201cno circumstances\u201d under which he would ask for a delay. This was a new version of his \u201cdo or die\u201d language. If Corbyn forced Johnson to eat his words, he\u2019d be humiliated.\n\nIf the prime minister then still wanted to fight an election \u2013 and he might by then have chickened out \u2013 Nigel Farage would accuse him of betraying Brexit. The Conservatives\u2019 chances of squeezing the Brexit Party vote and winning the election would then be reduced. Meanwhile, the chances of Labour and pro-European parties wrestling power from Johnson would go up.\n\nThe Labour leader should force an election at a time of his choosing, not at the time his mortal enemy picks.\n\nCorbyn will be meeting opposition leaders including the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas this morning to discuss tactics. Most, if not all, will be telling him not to fall for Johnson\u2019s trap and only agree to an election after Johnson has already delayed Brexit. Many Labour MPs, including the shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Tony Lloyd, are saying the same.\n\nThis is the Labour leader\u2019s chance for an important place in the history books. He must not flunk it.\n\nHugo Dixon is chair of InFacts and deputy chair of the People\u2019s Vote campaign", "description": "The next few days could define Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s place in history.
