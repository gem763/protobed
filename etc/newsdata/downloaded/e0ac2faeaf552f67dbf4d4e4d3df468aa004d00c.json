The Discovery \u2013 previously code named 'Project Jay' \u2013 was one of the wildest production models unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show that year, but nobody could have predicted the impact this ostensibly niche British vehicle would have on the future of car design for decades to come.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine a world in which every car manufacturer didn't have a 4x4 or SUV in its model line-up, but that's precisely the alien universe into which the original Mk1 Discovery was unleashed. It was an almost entirely new concept \u2013 a car that could hold its own off-road, while still offering ordinarily families the kind of comfort and mod-cons they'd come to expect from the modern automobile.\n\nIt was smart but angular, designed to occupy the gap between the Defender and the Range Rover without being too expensive. The idea of a Land Rover designed for widespread appeal, as opposed to wealthy gentry types or actual farmers, was a new one. But it set in motion a sequence of events that enabled the SUV to become the dominant body style two or three decades on.\n\nThis is an influential car (some would say iconic) and the transfer of its production to Slovakia is a bit of a shame. As is, some would say, the less-than'admired Mk5 model that continues to draw criticism years after its release. Let's take a closer look at the car and its history.", "description": "", "authors": ["Dr Ken German"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/images/2016/09/06/land-rover-discovery-mk1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkYCR5Nfj9Bfv-q8ZwekFuw8VgUB1iWfWQZ2Ah4T0Joo.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
