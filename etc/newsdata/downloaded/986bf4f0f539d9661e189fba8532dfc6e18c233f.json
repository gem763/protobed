Nonetheless, it promotes racist rhetoric and used a category tag called \"black crime\" for several years. Its stories often push anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim narratives, and heavily promotes Trump.\n\nIn addition to its slant, despite Facebook's anti-fake news advertisements, Breitbart has used misleading statistics, graphs, and figures in the past to push false assertions, such as that Trump won the popular vote. To state that \"Trump won the heartland,\" Breitbart outright ignored 52 counties won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nDays ahead of the roll-out, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced critical questions from lawmakers when he defended Facebook's cryptocurrency plan, Libra, along with a host of other issues, including the platform's decision not to remove factually incorrect political advertisements.\n\n\"This is a democracy,\" Zuckerberg replied. \"I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not have voted for are saying and judge their character for themselves.\"\n\nIn addition, The Guardian reports that at a launch event for Facebook News in New York, Zuckerberg declined to answer about the inclusion of Breitbart News specifically, but said \"I do think that part of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a diversity of \u2026 views in there.\"", "description": "Facebook is giving Breitbart News, the self-proclaimed platform for the alt-right, a prized space in its new 'high quality' news section on the app.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db4683cdee0190c58204042?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
