On the surface, he thought of his mom as \"a perfect government employee.\"\n\nAs a parent, she took a pragmatic, hands-off approach.\n\n\"She was really unusual,\" Christine said. \"She'd been through so much, teaching guys how to shoot. It's like, what do you need to teach a kid? You know? Go out and play.\"\n\nFlip remembered how she had her own code.\n\n\"If somebody was really an idiot, you know, she would say they were 'limited,' \" Flip said.\n\nChristine called it \"one of her most heavy-duty criticisms.\"\n\n\"She was tough,\" she said; Flip agrees.\n\nFlip and Christine attribute Susan's patriotism to her father, Ahn Chang-ho, an activist who fought against Japan's occupation of Korea and was killed by the Japanese in 1938.\n\nSo when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, Susan felt compelled to enlist.\n\nAccording to Susan's biographer, John Cha, Susan first tried to sign up for naval officer's school. Although she was qualified, her son Flip said, she was turned away because she was Asian.\n\nInstead, she enlisted as a service member. After excelling at basic training, she was selected as a candidate for officer school, and finally accepted.\n\n\"It was a white world and if you wanted to do anything you just had to forge ahead,\" Flip said.\n\nSoon, Susan was teaching refresher courses for experienced pilots.\n\nHer mother, a 5-foot-1-inch Korean American officer, loved to tell stories about her interactions with her male trainees, Christine said.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Flip Cuddy Courtesy of Flip Cuddy\n\nFlip recalled one memorable incident during a weapon training course.\n\n\"She talks about when you're going to start shooting,\" he said. \"And so this guy goes, 'I'm not shooting until I see the whites of those Japs' eyes.' \"\n\nIgnoring the slur, and true to character, Susan took charge.\n\nAs Flip tells it, \"She said, 'I don't care what you do up there. But when you're down here with me, you do what I tell you to do.' \"\n\nFor her children, her legacy looms large.\n\n\"I mean, how do you describe a person like that?\" Flip said. \"Who's a leader and successful at everything she does?\"\n\nFlip and Christine count themselves lucky to have had such an inspiring mother.\n\n\"I also would just say to Mom, what an incredible life you've lived,\" Christine said.\n\nAudio produced for Weekend Edition by Mia Warren.\n\nStoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.
