Things that were said by Ken Fisher were just absolutely horrifying,\u201d Chalekian said. \u201cHe made comments about genitalia, talked about picking up on a girl and \u2018Don\u2019t show \u2019em what\u2019s in your pants.\u2019 He made a reference to Jeffrey Epstein, [he] talked about charities are immoral, mentioned things about tripping on acid and other inappropriate comments at the conference.\u201d\n\nFellow attendee and consulting firm founder Sonya Dreizler said she also saw most of Fisher\u2019s chat, and confirmed Chalekian\u2019s claims to investment news outlet ThinkAdvisor.\n\nThe Lake Avenue CEO said that he spoke to others at the conference who said they were \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Fisher\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cMany of the women expressed to me this is one of the reasons why they don\u2019t like coming to these conferences. It makes them feel very uncomfortable and this obviously doesn\u2019t help the situation,\u201d Chalekian said, adding that he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the fireside talk and couldn\u2019t figure out whether Fisher was joking at first.\n\nIn response, Fisher said in an emailed statement to HuffPost: \u201cWhile I said words he cited I don\u2019t think he heard me correctly and clearly misconstrued my meaning and certainly my intended meaning. Most of his slant is \u2018gotcha\u2019 wrong in my view. To the extent he and any others were offended I apologize truly and sincerely.\u201d\n\nTiburon Strategic Advisors and Chalekian did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment.\n\nIn his Twitter video, Chalekian acknowledged that the content of fireside chats like the one Fisher participated in are typically kept private, but in speaking with others, he said he found that Fisher\u2019s comments are \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\n\u201cKen Fisher is actually known for making these types of comments around the workplace with his employees,\u201d Chalekian said. \u201cOne of his past employees told me that he had made the comment to them talking about the fact that he thinks that slavery should have never been abolished.\u201d\n\nA financial adviser who requested anonymity told HuffPost that Fisher also made off-color comments at the 2018 EBI West Conference, which another Twitter user also mentioned. The adviser said Fisher\u2019s comments were not \u201cquite as aggressive\u201d as the ones he made at Tiburon.\n\n\u201cAt EBI, he called annuity salespeople \u2018rat fuckers\u2019 & when asked what he would do different, said \u2018get laid more,\u2019\u201d the source wrote.\n\nThey added, \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with the idea that he feels totally comfortable saying these things in large groups as though no one would be horrified. (Or, he just doesn\u2019t care that he\u2019s a misogynist.)\u201d\n\nIf you have tips on Ken Fisher, please email them to carly.ledbetter@huffpost.com.\n\nLove HuffPost?
