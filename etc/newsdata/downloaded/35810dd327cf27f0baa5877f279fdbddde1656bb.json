Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Sunday replaced the director of his presidential campaign operations in the Granite State.\n\nThe campaign broke the news on Sunday to more than 40 members of Sanders\u2019 steering committee. The campaign announced that Joe Caiazzo was being replaced as state director.\n\nShannon Jackson, who made the announcement, will replace him. Jackson ran Sanders\u2019 2018 Senate re-election campaign and was a senior adviser on the independent senator\u2019s 2016 White House bid as well as the current campaign.\n\nSANDERS AND WARREN AVOID ATTACKS DURING DUELING EVENTS IN 'MUST WIN' NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n\u201cThank God the campaign finally figured out they had to make serious changes in New Hampshire,\u201d a longtime Sanders backer who attended the meeting told Fox News.\n\nThe move comes as some Sanders supporters in New Hampshire are looking over their shoulders at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts - the other progressive standard bearer in the record-setting field of Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nRecent polls in the state have fluctuated. A live telephone operator survey from the Boston Herald and Franklin Pierce University indicated Sanders at 29 percent, overall front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden at 21 percent and Elizabeth Warren at 21 percent. But another recent poll suggested a three-way tie between the three top-tier contenders and a third suggested Sanders lagging behind Biden and Warren.\n\nSANDERS AHEAD OF BIDEN AND WARREN IN NH IN MOST RECENT NH POLL\n\nSanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement on Sunday that \"we\u2019ve built a great team in NH and are in a really strong position there. The campaign is now building out our operations to include Massachusetts and Maine state directors as we increase our focus in Super Tuesday states. We are running a 50 state campaign, taking no state or voters for granted and expanding our operations to secure the Democratic nomination.\"\n\nCaiazzo was moved to one of those Super Tuesday states \u2013 Massachusetts. Caiazzo served as Sanders campaign\u2019s 2016 state director in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.\n\nBut Shakir\u2019s statement runs counter to what another steering committee member, who also asked for anonymity, emphasized.\n\nPointing to the campaign, the supporter said \u201cthey didn\u2019t listen to anything the steering committee suggested.\u201d The supporter also lamented that some \u201cBernie backers\u201d were going to Warren because the campaign \u201cdidn\u2019t listen to them.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nSanders has repeatedly refrained from calling New Hampshire a \u201cmust win\u201d state.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously a very important state, as is Iowa, South Carolina. We\u2019re working hard. We\u2019re going to do many, many rallies around the state, and I\u2019m feeling pretty good,\u201d he said during a stop in the state on Labor Day.\n\nBut, a veteran Granite State-based political scientist said the first primary state\u2019s crucial to both Sanders and Warren.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire is a must-win-or-place state for Senators Sanders and Warren,\u201d said Wayne Lesperance, the vice president of academic affairs and a political science professor at New England College. \u201cFor both candidates, there is no better home-field advantage in the early states than the Granite State.\u201d\n\nSanders trounced Hillary Clinton in the state\u2019s February 2016 Democratic presidential primary, launching the one-time longshot into an epic and marathon battle with the eventual nominee. Sanders\u2019 support and organization in the state stayed very strong, even he ended his first White House bid. His steering committee has met monthly ever since the 2016 general election. But the 2020 race is a very different contest, and Sanders is now facing rivals who are preaching the same progressive policies that he first made mainstream in the Democratic Party four years ago.\n\nThe transfer of Caiazzo to Massachusetts and of Jackson to New Hampshire came a day after the campaign parted ways with senior New Hampshire adviser Kurt Ehrenberg.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning there was clear and fundamental disagreement between Mr. Caiazzo and myself on how to run a successful presidential primary campaign in New Hampshire,\u201d Ehrenberg told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nEhrenberg, a longtime grassroots and labor organizer, set up Sanders the crucial New Hampshire organization for Sanders\u2019 first White House bid from scratch in the spring and summer of 2015.", "description": "Facing discontent and unheeded warnings\u00a0from longtime supporters that he could lose the New Hampshire primary, Sen.
