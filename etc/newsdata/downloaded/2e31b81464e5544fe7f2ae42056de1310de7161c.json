(TSX:SMT) (BVL:SMT) (NYSE AMERICAN:SMTS) (\u201cSierra Metals\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) is pleased to report third quarter 2019 production results featuring the highest level of quarterly consolidated equivalent metal production.\n\nResults are from Sierra Metals\u2019 three underground mines in Latin America: The Yauricocha polymetallic mine in Peru, and the Bolivar copper and Cusi silver Mines in Mexico.\n\nThird Quarter 2019 Production Highlights\n\nSilver production of 1.0 million ounces; a 34% increase from Q3 2018\n\nCopper production of 11.1 million pounds; a 34% increase from Q3 2018\n\nZinc production of 22.5 million pounds; an 8% increase from Q3 2018\n\nLead production of 10.5 million pounds; a 65% increase from Q3 2018\n\nGold production of 3,490 ounces; an 83% increase from Q3 2018\n\nCopper equivalent production of 32.3 million pounds; a 37% increase from Q3 2018\n\nRecord quarterly ore throughput and metal production at the Yauricocha Mine in Peru and the Bolivar Mine in Mexico\n\nThe Company achieved record quarterly consolidated equivalent metal production and ore throughput, as well as record quarterly ore throughput and equivalent metal production from the Yauricocha and Bolivar Mines. The Company has continued to build on its successful plant expansions, and mine production increases in Mexico over the last three quarters. This has resulted in record quarterly metal production, as the Company is approaching its 2019 target of 4,250 tonnes per day (\u201cTPD\u201d) at Bolivar and 1,200 TPD at Cusi. Consolidated production of silver increased 34% to 1.0 million ounces, copper increased by 34% to 11.1 million pounds, lead increased 65% to 10.5 million pounds, zinc increased 8% to 22.5 million pounds, and gold increased 83% to 3,490 ounces compared to Q3 2018.\n\nIgor Gonzales, President and CEO of Sierra Metals commented: \u201cThe Company continues to strengthen its performance in 2019 achieving record quarterly consolidated equivalent metal production in the third quarter. This includes continued successful recovery and making up for lost production at Yauricocha from the illegal strike, as well as record quarterly ore throughput and metal production at both the Yauricocha and Bolivar Mines. At the Cusi Mine, which accounts for approximately only 5% of Company revenue, we unfortunately encountered and dealt with subsidence issues, which delayed development and access to higher-grade ore, but we now have new contractors on-site, which will allow us to see higher grade material reach the mill in November. Additionally, completion of a new crushing circuit will allow for improved tonnage throughput and recoveries at the mill. Aside from the temporary setback at Cusi, we continued to successfully ramp up our mine and mill expansion plans while reaping the benefits of operational improvement programs. Going forward we expect to deliver on our annual guidance at Yauricocha at the same time continuing to ramp up and further improve ore throughput and tonnage at our Mexican operations.\u201d\n\nConsolidated Production Results\n\nConsolidated Production 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended Q3 2019 Q3 2018 % Var.

Daily ore throughput averaged 3,511 TPD during the quarter, as efforts continue to ensure that the 24 days of production lost during the illegal strike action at Yauricocha during April and May, will not affect the annual production guidance for the mine.\n\nThe 8% increase in throughput realized at the mine during Q3 2019, as well as significantly higher head grades for all metals, except gold, and higher recoveries for all metals, except zinc, resulted in a 33% increase in zinc equivalent metal production compared to Q3 2018. The higher silver and lead head grades and silver and lead production realized during Q3 2019 was the result of increased production from the cuerpos chicos that contained higher silver and lead head grades during the quarter. Higher copper head grades resulted from the inclusion of certain copper-enriched zones at Esperanza, polymetallic ore from the Central Mine Zone, and a small inclusion of polymetallic ore from the cuerpos chicos.\n\nA summary of production from the Yauricocha Mine for Q3 2019 is provided below:\n\nYauricocha Production 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended Q3 2019 Q3 2018 % Var.

The average daily ore throughput realized during the quarter was approximately 3,800 TPD, and the Company expects to reach 4,250 TPD during Q4 2019. The 46% increase in throughput, and higher silver and gold head grades, and higher copper and silver recoveries resulted in a 55% increase in copper equivalent pounds produced during Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018. This increase was achieved despite a 13% decrease in copper head grades and 9% decrease in gold recoveries. However, the Company expects copper head grades to increase during Q4 2019, as more ore is sourced from Bolivar West. In Q3 2019, copper production increased by 31% to 5,115,000 pounds, silver production increased 84% to 173,000 ounces, and gold production increased 127% to 2,073 ounces compared to Q3 2018.\n\nDevelopment and infrastructure improvements continue in the effort to push ore throughput at Bolivar to 4,250 TPD during Q4 2019. Target mining areas will be the Gallo Inferior, Mina de Fierro, Chimneys, Breccias, and Gallo Superior orebodies. Infill drilling will continue on the Bolivar West and Gallo Inferior areas, while mine development will focus on the Gallo Inferior and Breccia zones. This work will allow the Company to increase the number of minable stopes available in order to increase ore throughput at the plant.\n\nA summary of production for the Bolivar Mine for Q3 2019 is provided below:\n\nBolivar Production 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended Q3 2019 Q3 2018 % Var.

The 28% increase in throughput realized during Q3 2019 resulted in a 15% increase in silver equivalent ounces produced, despite lower head grades for all metals, except gold, as we continue to develop deeper into the Santa Rosa de Lima zone which has higher silver head grades.\n\nDuring Q3 2019, significant improvements were made to the crushing and grinding circuits at the Plant, as well as increasing the number of hours per day that the plant can operate. However, development was delayed due heavy rains as well as a subsidence issue in the mine, which resulted in a 16-meter pillar required to be left for stability purposes. As a result of the delayed development, lower-grade zones that were accessible were mined resulting in lower silver grades in the quarter. Studies are currently underway addressing the best way to access the ore located within the pillar. Additionally, new mine contractors arrived on-site at Cusi during October 2019, and their focus will be to increase development rates to 90 meters per month and increase stope access. The Company\u2019s focus remains on increasing head grades by mining higher-grade ore located on the 1704 and 1720 levels of the Santa Rosa de Lima zone, which is expected to occur in November this year. Throughput was lower during Q3 2019 compared to Q2 2019 as efforts continue to reduce dilution to ensure that economic ore is provided to the plant.\n\nSilver production of 271,000 ounces increased 17%, gold production of 135 ounces increased 62%, and lead production of 168,000 pounds decreased 31% in Q3 2019 compared to Q3 2018.\n\nA revised LOM plan is nearing completion at Cusi, and we expect to have an updated NI 43-101 report completed during Q2 2020. The Company continues to increase mill feed from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone, while mining selected structures in the older part of the mine, in order to continue to ramp up to the goal of 1,200 TPD during Q4 2019.\n\nA summary of production for the Cusi Mine for Q3 2019 is provided below:\n\nCusi Production 3 Months Ended 9 Months Ended Q3 2019 Q3 2018 % Var.
