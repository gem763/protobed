The semiconductor firm is one of the largest makers of DRAM and NAND memory chips and Micron stock has skyrocketed 48% in the last three months to destroy its industry\u2019s 11% average climb.\n\nDespite the positivity, which includes a larger 2019 climb, Micron\u2019s actual quarterly results tumbled the last two periods. And Micron\u2019s Q4 estimates don\u2019t show signs of a return to growth.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Story?\n\nMicron faces ebbs and flows that are relatively inherent to the semiconductor industry. The chip market is a cyclical business because it is reliant on broader business and investment cycles. More specifically, NAND and DRAM pricing has hurt the Boise, Idaho-headquartered firm. Micron\u2019s own outsized success and growth over the last several years\u2014which saw it soar from roughly $11 a share in January 2016 to $58 in May 2018\u2014has also put the firm in a difficult spot.\n\nAlong with the tough comparison periods, the specter of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war sparked industry-wide fears. Nonetheless, spending from PC and smartphone makers to cloud computing firms and everyone in between, is undoubtedly set to return. This includes countless unknown companies to global powers like Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Google GOOGL, and Amazon AMZN.\n\nMicron executives last quarter pointed to some signs of improvement. Yet their overall tone remained cautious. \u201cWhile we are seeing early signs of demand improvement, we plan to reduce our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 to help improve industry supply-demand balance,\u201d CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in prepared remarks last quarter.\n\nPrice Movement\n\nIn spite of all the broader semiconductor industry worries, along with issues that directly impact Micron, MU stock has surged roughly 52% in 2019. This climb easily tops it\u2019s industry\u2019s 23% average and the S&P 500\u2019s 18%. In fact, Micron\u2019s post-Q3 strength has helped it inch toward current industry standout AMD AMD and blow away Nvidia\u2019s NVDA 29% climb and chip titan Intel's INTC 6%.\n\nThe last two years, however, have been volatile as we can see in the chart. Investors will also notice that Micron over the last decade has crushed the semiconductor market, while also having experienced far more turbulence.\n\nOutlook & Historical Comparisons\n\nMoving on, Micron\u2019s Q4 sales are projected to tumble 46.4% from $8.44 billion in Q4 2018 to touch $4.52 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Investors should note that this would represent a larger drop than Q3\u2019s roughly 39% downturn and the second quarter\u2019s 20.6% decline.\n\nOverall, Micron\u2019s fiscal 2019 revenue is projected to fall around 24% from $30.39 billion last year to $23.08 billion. Meanwhile, Micron\u2019s first quarter 2020 sales are projected to fall 40.5%, with full-year fiscal 2020 revenue expected to sink 15% below our current-year projection to reach $19.60 billion.\n\nClearly, Wall Street and investors won\u2019t love to see these projections, but there are reasons that Micron stock has surged this year despite the company\u2019s downturn: one of which is that they have seen this before. Micron\u2019s revenue fell 1% in 2015 and 23.4% in 2016. To be exact, Micron\u2019s quarterly revenue fell on a year-over-year basis for six straight periods from Q3 2015 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.", "description": "Micron (MU) is set to release its fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results after the closing bell on Thursday, September 26.
