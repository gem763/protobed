Ortis\u2019 defense lawyer Ian Carter did not immediately respond.\n\nAs part of his bail conditions, Ortis, 47, is required to live with his parents in Abbotsford, British Columbia, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported. He is also forbidden to use any kind of device that connects to the internet and must report to an RCMP detachment on a weekly basis.\n\nThe CBC could not cite the reasons that Ortis was granted bail because of a publication ban, a routine proceeding for bail hearings in Canada.\n\nCanada is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network with the United States, Britain, New Zealand and Australia. Security experts have said the case could damage Canada\u2019s standing inside the intelligence-sharing network.\n\nIn a September media briefing, RCMP Commission Brenda Lucki conceded there was concern in the Five Eyes community, but said it was too early to tell what damage might have been done, noting none of Canada\u2019s allies had clamped down on information sharing so far.", "description": "An Ontario court on Tuesday released on bail a top Canadian police intelligence official charged with leaking secret information last month, the country's public prosecution service said.", "authors": ["Kelsey Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
