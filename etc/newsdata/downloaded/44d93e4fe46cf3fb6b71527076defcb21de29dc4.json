Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Democratic presidential hopeful, speaks to reporters outside his home Tuesday in Burlington, Vt. Sanders is recovering from a heart attack suffered earlier this month. (Wilson Ring/AP)\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, off the campaign trail and resting at home until next week\u2019s Democratic debate, said Tuesday he had been \u201cdumb\u201d to ignore symptoms that might have foretold the heart attack he suffered a week ago and he urged others not to make the same mistake. He also admitted that he will have to reduce the number of campaign events he holds a day because of his health.\n\n\u201cDuring this campaign, I\u2019ve been doing in some cases three or four rallies a day, running all over the state \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, wherever,\u201d Sanders told reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vt. \u201cAnd yet I, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms.\u201d\n\nSanders visited a cardiologist Tuesday morning, and when he returned, he told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna change the nature of the campaign a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not doing four rallies a day,\u201d said Sanders, who had adopted a more furious campaign schedule than many of his much younger opponents.\n\nSanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at \u201cthe appropriate time.\u201d Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls \u2014 have also committed to releasing their medical records.\n\nSanders met reporters outside his Burlington home where he has spent the past few days with family, making calls and recovering from a heart attack he suffered during a grass roots fundraising event in Las Vegas last week.\n\nThe 78-year-old felt chest pains last Tuesday night and was taken to a hospital, where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Monday, he was back in Burlington, taking a walk with his wife, Jane, and addressing his campaign on a staff-wide conference call.\n\nThe campaign had not initially disclosed that Sanders had suffered a heart attack, acknowledging at first only that the stents had been implanted. Tuesday\u2019s remarks were the first in which Sanders himself has been so open about what happened.\n\nThe senator from Vermont had been making more frequent campaign stops than almost any of his fellow Democrats, despite being the oldest candidate in the field. He had never spoken publicly about feeling increased fatigue, though it was clear he was maintaining a grueling pace.\n\nFar from admitting he was tired, Sanders tried to demonstrate that despite his age he remained robust and vibrant. In late August, for example, he participated in a softball game with his campaign staffers in Iowa.\n\nBut he suffered occasional minor physical setbacks. Sanders cut his head on a shower door in March, and had to cancel a day of events when he lost his voice in September.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any message that I hope we can get out there, it\u2019s that I want people to pay attention to their symptoms,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hurting, when you\u2019re fatigued, when you have a pain in your chest \u2014 listen to it.\u201d\n\nSome Sanders advisers and supporters said they hoped Sanders would slow his campaigning pace somewhat, a wish that seems likely to be granted for at least the next few days. Campaign officials have signaled that Sanders will not hit the campaign trail again until next Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nAllies also say they hope Sanders will talk openly about his heart attack as a way to present a more human side, a departure for a candidate noticeably reluctant to talk about himself. In his remarks in recent days, as well as appearances with his wife, he seems to have begun that process.\n\nIn the meantime, the campaign has churned along even without campaign appearances by the candidate. On Monday, Sanders\u2019s team rolled out a proposal to curtail the role of money in politics. On Tuesday, the campaign began airing $1.3 million in television ads in Iowa.\n\nLater Tuesday, the Sanders team announced a series of endorsements from local officials in Nevada. And Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chair, tweeted that Sanders \u201chad a great call\u201d with his campaign co-chairs.\n\nSanders\u2019s hiatus from the trail mean the Democratic debate in Ohio next week is likely to be a crucial moment for his campaign. He will have had 14 days of rest between his procedure and the debate, when voters and rivals are likely to scrutinize his performance for any signs of fatigue or additional physical strain.", "description": "The senator, recovering from a heart attack, tells reporters outside his Vermont home he was foolish to discount signs of physical strain \u2014 and urges others not to make the same mistake.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5q_cIX-xOTxK2XDzi_fFYE3ACig=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CXAM7LHKBII6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
