It was on Aug. 14, 1935, that Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law.\n\nRead: Possibly the best Social Security claiming strategy for millennials\n\nTo help celebrate the occasion, I want to analyze yet another retirement income proposal that has recently received a lot of attention. In the process of doing that, I think you will come to appreciate even more what Social Security provides.\n\nThis proposal to which I refer is the so-called \u201cpublic option,\u201d which is being advanced in a book by that name written by law professors Ganesh Sitaraman of Vanderbilt and Anne Alstott of Yale. Here\u2019s a summary:\n\n\u201cEvery American would automatically be enrolled in a retirement program that would withhold, say, 3 percent or 5 percent from every worker\u2019s paycheck. The money would be deposited in a retirement savings account managed by the federal government, and the savings would be locked up until retirement. Savers would have limited investment choices, and the short menu would include only low-fee index funds\u2026At retirement, the balance would be converted to a life annuity, paying a guaranteed sum every month for the rest of the worker\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nTheir plan has numerous details, in which the veritable Devil resides. If you\u2019re interested in finding out more, I encourage you to read a recent article the professors wrote in the Atlantic magazine. What I want to do in this column is show how difficult it would be for the average worker to match what he is getting from Social Security. It\u2019s not clear he will be able to do that.\n\nThe professors are not proposing their public option be a substitute for Social Security. They intend it instead to be a supplement. But the data suggest that, in order that the average retiree has adequate funds for retirement, he will need about double what is currently provided by the average monthly Social Security benefit of $1,461. I wanted to see how likely it is that the proposed public option would be able to do so.\n\nRead: This hybrid Social Security plan could help more people save enough for retirement\n\nConsider: To purchase an immediate annuity that pays $1,461 a month, and which is automatically indexed to inflation, a single male age 65, would have to pay $416, 458, according to quotes I was able to obtain from ImmediateAnnuities.com. Consider next a hypothetical worker who, per the proposed public option, started investing 5% of each paycheck beginning at age 25, and continued to do that religiously for 40 years.\n\nAssuming this worker\u2019s salary for each year of his working life equaled the median of current salaries for each age cohort, adjusted for inflation, and assuming his portfolio is 100% invested in equities and it outperformed inflation by 4% annualized, then his portfolio at age 65 would be worth around $234,000 in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nNot nearly enough, in other words.\n\nAnd notice carefully that my assumptions were generous: Most financial planners recommend that we gradually reduce our equity allocation as we approach retirement, in favor of bonds, and if the hypothetical worker in my example did that his return would be lower than what I assumed. And, even for a 100% stock portfolio, it is generous to assume it will beat inflation by 4% annualized. Over the last 20 years, for example, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.01% (with dividends) has produced an annualized real return of 3.5%. And, given equities\u2019 current extreme overvaluation, a below-average return over the next several decades is entirely possible.\n\nAnother way of showing how hard it is to duplicate Social Security: Consider how much of this hypothetical worker\u2019s paycheck he would have to invest over 40 years if he is to have a portfolio at age 65 that could purchase the annuity equal to what Social Security provides the average worker. Assuming his portfolio appreciates at the same 4% annualized rate above inflation, he would need to invest about 9% of each of his paychecks over 40 years. That\u2019s asking a lot.\n\nAlternately, consider what investment performance would be required for this hypothetical worker, allocating 5% of each paycheck, and assuming it is 100% invested in equities, to have enough money to purchase the required annuity. His performance would have to be close to 7% annualized above inflation\u2014which is higher than the stock market\u2019s long-term average return since 1802, according to data compiled by Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nNone of this is meant as a criticism of the professors\u2019 public option. Any program that gets more workers to save and invest for their retirement is a good thing. The point of my analysis instead is to offer an appreciation of how good a deal Social Security provides.\n\nHow can Social Security provide its annuities at so much less than the private market? There are two main factors. The first is that Social Security has a far broader \u201ccustomer\u201d base than any insurance company could hope for, because of which it is able to spread risk across a greater number of people. Secondly, partly because of its larger customer base and partly because it is a nonprofit and has the federal government\u2019s guarantee behind it, Social Security\u2019s fees are far lower than those of a private insurance company.\n\nGiven the modest changes that would be necessary to beef it up for at least the rest of this century, that becomes perhaps the highest public policy priority for retirees and soon-to-be-retirees.\n\nThose changes would be a wonderful birthday present for not just Social Security, but for us all.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
