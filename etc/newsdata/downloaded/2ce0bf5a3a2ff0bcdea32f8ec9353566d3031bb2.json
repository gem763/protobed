The country is contorted and polarized, with the flames of hate fanned by leaders at the highest level.\"\n\nWorking Class is a workers' organization with 3 million members and recruits people in working-class neighborhoods to support labor-focused candidates and policies, according to its website.\n\nFonda wrote that she connected with three different voters across the political spectrum with a \"respectful conversation that started with their concerns and opinions.\"\n\nOne pivotal moment Fonda described was from her conversation with a woman she called Sharon, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump who didn't realize that his health-care bill would mean her son's insurance would stop covering him due to his serious preexisting condition.\n\nFonda wrote that Sharon \"seemed to stop breathing for a moment.\"\n\n\"I had no idea,\" Sharon said. \"I can't let that happen.\"\n\nFace-to-face interactions like these are a critical way \"to outsmart the Facebook algorithms and digital foreign meddling,\" in the run-up to an election, Fonda wrote, pointing to her past work as an activist.\n\nRead more: It's still way too easy for countries to meddle in America's elections. Here's how it will happen in 2020.\n\nAs tangled as things seem right now, the way we get out of this mess is straightforward,\" Fonda wrote. \"I've seen it. The process builds trust, and it sends a message: You matter enough that I'm here on your doorstep.\"\n\nIn addition to the door-knocking, Fonda donated $1,000 each to several candidates, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and two candidates who have since left the race, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Fonda also donated $2,000 to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFonda is just one of dozens of celebrities who have gotten involved with campaigns ahead of the 2020 Election, including Anna Wintour, Reese Witherspoon, and Danny DeVito.", "description": "Fonda wrote that she feels \"scared\" of the current political climate and wanted to take action to connect with fellow voters for the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6c155f21214c691b09dd64-750-375.jpg"}
