Grant's Battles, This Was The One He Never Wanted To Relive", "language": "en", "text": "Key point: The Civil War was ridiculously brutal.\n\n\u201cLee\u2019s army is really whipped,\u201d declared Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck on May 26, 1864. \u201cThe prisoners we now take show it, and the actions of his army show it unmistakably. A battle with them outside of entrenchments cannot be had.\u201d Thwarted by the Army of Northern Virginia at the North Anna River, Grant was preparing to swing around Robert E. Lee\u2019s right flank again and push southeast. Lee then would have no choice but to leave his entrenchments at North Anna and attempt to stop the Federal forces from reaching Richmond, probably along the Chickahominy River. Believing the fight had gone out of Lee\u2019s army, Grant added, \u201cI feel that our success over Lee\u2019s army is already insured.\u201d He would quickly discover that he had spoken too soon.\n\nAlmost a month earlier, Maj. Gen. George Meade, operational commander of the Army of the Potomac, had initiated the Overland Campaign with some 118,000 troops. Then came, in swift succession, the Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse, and North Anna, which cost the Union Army an appalling 40,000 casualties. Meade needed reinforcements not only to replace his casualties, but also the many valuable veterans whose three-year enlistments were about to expire at the end of June. Grant, as general-in-chief of all Union forces in the East, petitioned Washington for more men. President Abraham Lincoln sent him 33,000 garrison troops belonging mostly to heavy artillery regiments with no combat experience. At the same time, Grant recalled the XVIII Corps under Maj. Gen. William Smith and other troops that could be spared from Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler\u2019s Army of the James, currently bottled up on the Virginia Peninsula at Bermuda Hundred, southeast of Richmond.\n\nOn the evening of May 26, the Federal army started to move. Maj. Gen. Phil Sheridan led two of his cavalry divisions southeast to seize a crossing over the Pamunkey River at Hanovertown. Behind them marched Brig. Gen. David Russell\u2019s infantry division from Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright\u2019s VI Corps. Sending out pickets to cover their withdrawal, the four remaining corps of bluecoats slipped across the North Anna River in the rain and darkness on pontoon bridges. The maneuver went without a hitch, although Confederate pickets \u201cmade things lively\u201d for Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock\u2019s II Corps as it withdrew.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The Federal army did not forget its mistakes.", "authors": ["Warfare History Network"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/56o8ohJzuJg5WcRLRGrC7Q--~B/aD04NzY7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/916e199d15b7309b7d3c108093e38d34", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
