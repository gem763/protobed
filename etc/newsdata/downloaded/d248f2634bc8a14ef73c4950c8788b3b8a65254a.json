Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who was spoofed by comic Maya Rudolph on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as a no-nonsense \u201cwalking, talking TNT show,\u201d is proving that she knows how to take a joke.\n\nLaunching its 45th season with a bang, the show hosted a mock CNN Democratic forum to talk impeachment, because, as Cecily Strong playing anchor Erin Burnett noted, what better way to tackle a national crisis than \u201cwith a muddled, 10-person town hall debate.\u201d\n\nAs Harris was introduced, Rudolph as the 2020 candidate referred to a now-famous phrase used by Harris in a real-life Democratic debate in June.\n\n\u201cNow, Erin, that little girl you just introduced, that little girl was me,\u201d Rudolph said, clarifying that she\u2019s not \u201cjust that little girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also America\u2019s cool aunt, a fun aunt. I call that a \u2018funt\u2019 \u2015 the kind of funt that will give you weed, but then arrest you for having weed,\u201d she continued.\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter over the clear jab at Harris\u2019 controversial record as California\u2019s attorney general from 2011 to 2017, during which more than 1,000 people in the state were jailed for marijuana violations. That\u2019s despite her past admission of having smoked marijuana in college.\n\nHaving since evolved on the issue, in July, she partnered with Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) to introduce a bill to decriminalize marijuana use and ease the war on drugs.\n\nDespite Rudolph\u2019s round of one-liners, which included proclaiming herself \u201ca smooth-talking lady lawyer\u201d and the embodiment of the TV detective-medical examiner duo Rizzoli and Isles, Harris had the perfect response.\n\n\u201cThat girl being played by @MayaRudolph on @nbcsnl? That girl was me,\u201d she tweeted Sunday, receiving an enthusiastic reply from the actor.\n\nYES SHE WAS SENATOR HARRIS!!! https://t.co/nW9tRdJu6D \u2014 Maya Rudolph (@MayaRudolph) September 29, 2019\n\nHarris first used her \u201cthat little girl was me\u201d line when facing off with former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she confronted over his past opposition to busing programs to integrate schools.\n\n\u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day, and that little girl was me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe headline-making quote soon went viral, appearing on both her Twitter account and T-shirts being sold by her campaign.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nKamala Harris, Like All The Other Candidates, Is Going All-In On Iowa\n\nKamala Harris Calls For Probe Into State Dept.
