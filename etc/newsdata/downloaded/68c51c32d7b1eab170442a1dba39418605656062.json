However, official rhetoric surrounding inflation has turned relatively softer, with core inflation now expected to print at the 'lower end' of the 1 to 2 per cent range, compared to the previous tone which cited core inflation to come in at the 'lower half'. Headline inflation has also been downgraded to 'around 0.5 per cent', from the previous expectation for it to 'average 0.5 to 1.5 per cent' in 2019.\"\n\nDBS Group Research FX strategist Philip Wee and rates strategist Eugene Leow\n\n\"The decisions at this morning's Singdollar policy review were broadly in line with expectations. According to our model, the band should start appreciating at a pace of 0.5 per cent per year versus 1 per cent previously. The central bank has kept the door (open) for another easing should the already weak growth/inflation outlook deteriorate significantly.\"\n\nBarclays analysts Brian Tan, Ashish Agrawal, Abbas Keshvani\n\n\"The MAS eased FX (forex) policy, reducing the slope of the official S$NEER policy band 'slightly', as we expected. However, the slope still appears to be positive \u2013 the MAS did not describe policy as 'neutral' as a result of the adjustment. We believe this implies the MAS reduced the slope by 50 bp (basis points) to an estimated 0.5 per cent, in line with our view and consensus expectations.\n\n\"We had argued that the MAS would ease FX policy because of the storm clouds gathering over the global outlook, the domestic economy remaining weak and the output gap likely turning negative... However, we had expected the MAS to reduce the slope in a gradual fashion, as it was likely to project a pickup in 2020 GDP growth and the outlook was shrouded in uncertainty, implying the potential for positive surprises that could force the MAS to reverse course in 2020 if it eased more aggressively this time. The policy statement suggests these were indeed key considerations \u2013 the MAS expects GDP growth to 'improve modestly' in 2020 from around 0.5 per cent in 2019, but also noted that 'this projection is subject to considerable uncertainty in the external environment'.\n\n\"Overall, while our base case is for the MAS to remain on hold in April 2020, we view the risks as being tilted in favour of a further 50 bp slope reduction to zero per cent.\"\n\nCMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang\n\n\"A mild monetary easing is probably insufficient to boost manufacturing and exports in the short term. But the central bank also said it is 'prepared to recalibrate monetary policy should prospects for inflation and growth weaken significantly'.\"", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - AGAINST a backdrop of lacklustre growth, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) \"slightly\" reduced the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band in its half-yearly October decision on Monday, while keeping the width and centre of the band unchanged. .
