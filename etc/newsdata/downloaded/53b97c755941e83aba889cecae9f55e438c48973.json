Cuban Americans see parallels between what has happened under socialist rule in Venezuela and under communism in Cuba.\n\n\u201cIn South Florida, democracy in Venezuela is a local issue,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a South Florida Democrat who plans to attend the forum with Pelosi.\n\nAn effort to offer immigration protections to Venezuelan immigrants has bogged down due to partisan infighting in Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been urged by Florida leaders to shield Venezuelans from deportation but he has taken no action. The House in July passed a bill authorizing temporary protected status to Venezuelans, but the measure has not moved in the Senate.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) last week offered an alternative that would have granted protections to Venezuelans and overhauled the program, but Democrats blocked the measure. Scott accused Democrats of using the \u201cVenezuelan community as a political prop instead of working with us to find a solution.\u201d\n\nDemocrats insist their efforts are serious.\n\n\u201cWe cannot champion Venezuelans in Venezuela, then ignore them here,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said in a statement. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi led the House in passing tough measures to protect Venezuelans, here and at home. The Speaker and my House colleagues are eager to strategize with Venezuelans in Florida on how to continue these efforts.\u201d\n\nWasserman Schultz and Mucarsel-Powell are scheduled to attend the forum, along with Reps. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) and Albio Sires (D-N.J.), chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Venezuelan Ambassador Carlos Vecchio.\n\nPelosi is heading to Florida the same day that President Donald Trump is scheduled to discuss Medicare at The Villages, a sprawling central Florida retirement community and Republican stronghold.", "description": "Florida is home to at least 190,000 Venezuelans and the economic crisis in that country reverberates loudly in South Florida.", "authors": ["Gary Fineout"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9c/5a/73f3ee0042c4abe4ef2f6ade741d/160907-nancy-pelosi-gty-1160.jpg"}
