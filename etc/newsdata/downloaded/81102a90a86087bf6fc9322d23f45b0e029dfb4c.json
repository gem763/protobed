I don\u2019t need it to hunt, I don\u2019t need it to protect myself. It was fun to use. I like taking it out to the range, but if giving this back, or cutting it to pieces, or selling it to the government helps to keep us safer, then by all means, let\u2019s do it,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said the responses came from parents concerned for the safety of their children in school amid an ongoing series of mass shootings across the country.\n\nIn an impassioned call for gun control during the Thursday debate, O\u2019Rourke decried weapons \u201cdesigned to kill people on a battlefield,\u201d vowing to take action if elected.\n\n\u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, you\u2019re not going to be allowed to use it against your fellow Americans anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nLater clarifying his position in a separate MSNBC interview, O\u2019Rourke noted the public would simply be legally required to participate in his proposed mandatory buyback program for semi-automatic weapons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expecting Americans to follow the law,\u201d he said, emphasizing that it will be mandatory rather than voluntary.\n\nHowever, not all Democratic candidates are on the same page. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris support mandatory buybacks, but Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar prefers a voluntary initiative.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s statements follow two mass shootings in his state last month. On Aug. 3, a gunman killed 22 people at an El Paso Walmart. On Aug. 31, a shooting spree between Odessa and Midland killed 7 people. Both incidents left more than 40 injured.", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate is defending his mandatory buyback plan after telling gun owners, \"Hell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7d00b5230000e903539a54.jpeg?cache=akcqfk2wjm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
