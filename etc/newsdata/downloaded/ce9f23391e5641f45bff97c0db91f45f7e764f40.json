After World War I, the Allies\u2019 negotiations with representatives of the defeated Ottoman Empire initially involved provisions for an autonomous Kurdistan. But that was abandoned by the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. Multiple attempts at greater autonomy or nationhood since then have been suppressed or quashed.\n\nKurds, Turkey and the U.S.: 5 Years of Tension, Alliances and Conflict\n\nOct. 10, 2019\n\nSome of the Kurds who had been pushed out of the Ottoman Empire and Turkey landed in the Soviet Union, said Mutlu Civiroglu, a Kurdish affairs analyst in Washington. So when World War II began, many fought with the Soviets on the side of the Allies. But they were difficult to track because they did not fight under a Kurdish flag.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com World Middleeast Trump-Kurds-Normandy.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
