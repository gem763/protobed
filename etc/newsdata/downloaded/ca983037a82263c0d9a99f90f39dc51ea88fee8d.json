UPDATE 1-U.S. natgas futures hold at two-week low as weather moderates\n\n(Adds closing prices)\n\nSept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures held at a two-week low on Monday on forecasts for temperatures to moderate over the next two weeks.\n\nMeteorologists forecast colder-than-normal temperatures in the western third of the country, warmer in the eastern two-thirds.\n\nTraders noted warmer-than-normal weather in late September and early October reduces demand because homes and businesses will not need to use much air conditioning or heat.\n\nFront-month gas futures for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 0.7 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $2.527 per million British thermal units, their lowest close since Sept. 6.\n\nThat put the contract down for a fifth day in a row for the first time since July.\n\nAs the weather moderates with the coming of autumn, data provider Refinitiv projected average gas demand in the lower 48 U.S. states will rise from 83.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this week to 83.3 bcfd next week as heating demand and exports edge higher.\n\nGas flows to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants rose to 6.1 bcfd on Sunday from a low of 5.7 bcfd on Friday following the shutdown of Dominion Energy Inc's D.N Cove Point in Maryland for planned maintenance, according to Refinitiv data. projected flows to LNG terminals could rise to a near record high of around 6.6 bcfd by the end of next week.\n\nExports to Mexico, meanwhile, slipped to 5.0 bcfd on Sunday as flows on some pipes decreased, down from a record high 5.6 bcfd last week as gas started to move through the 2.6-bcfd Valley Crossing pipeline from Texas to Mexico. said utilities likely added 86 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas to storage during the week ended Sept. 20. That compares with an injection of 51 bcf during the same week last year and a five-year (2014-18) average build of 74 bcf for the period. EIA/GAS\n\nIf correct, the increase would boost stockpiles to 3.189 trillion cubic feet (tcf), 1.9% below the five-year average of 3.252 tcf for this time of year.\n\nThe amount of gas in inventory has remained below the five-year average since September 2017. It fell as much as 33% below that average in March 2019. But with production near a record high, analysts said, stockpiles should reach a near-normal 3.7 tcf by the end of the summer injection season on Oct. 31. NGAS/POLL\n\nGas production in the lower 48 states edged up to 92.3 bcfd on Sunday from an average of 92.0 bcfd last week, according to Refinitiv data. That compares with an all-time daily high of 93.0 bcfd on Aug. 19.\n\nWeek ended\n\nYear ago Five-year\n\nended\n\nSep 20\n\naverage\n\n20(Forecas Sep 13\n\nSep 20\n\n(Actual)\n\nU.S. natgas storage (bcf):\n\nRefinitiv Heating (HDD), Cooling (CDD) and Total (TDD) Degree Days\n\nTwo-Week Total Forecast\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nPrior\n\n10-Year\n\n30-Year\n\nNorm U.S. GFS HDDs\n\n70 U.S. GFS CDDs\n\n73 U.S. GFS TDDs\n\nRefinitiv U.S. Weekly GFS Supply and Demand Forecasts\n\nPrior Week Current Next Week This week Five-Yea\n\nlast year\n\nAverage\n\nMonth U.S. Supply (bcfd)\n\nU.S. Lower 48 Dry Production\n\n75.2 U.S. Imports from Canada\n\n7.7 U.S. LNG Imports\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Supply\n\nU.S. Demand (bcfd) U.S. Exports to Canada\n\n2.2 U.S. Exports to Mexico\n\n3.8 U.S. LNG Exports\n\n1.1 U.S. Commercial\n\n4.8 U.S. Residential\n\n3.8 U.S. Power Plant\n\n29.9 U.S. Industrial\n\n20.2 U.S. Plant Fuel\n\n4.6 U.S. Pipe Distribution\n\n2.0 U.S. Vehicle Fuel\n\n0.1 Total U.S. Consumption\n\n65.4 Total U.S. Demand\n\nSNL U.S. Natural Gas Next-Day Prices ($ per mmBtu)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nHenry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL\n\nTransco Z6 New York NG-CG-NY-SNL\n\nPG&E Citygate NG-CG-PGE-SNL\n\nDominion South NG-PCN-APP-SNL\n\nChicago Citygate NG-CG-CH-SNL\n\nAlgonquin Citygate NG-CG-BS-SNL\n\nSoCal Citygate NG-SCL-CGT-SNL\n\nWaha Hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL\n\nSNL U.S. Power Next-Day Prices ($ per megawatt-hour)\n\nCurrent\n\nPrior\n\nNew England EL-PK-NPMS-SNL\n\n23.75\n\n23.75\n\nPJM West EL-PK-PJMW-SNL\n\n36.25\n\n24.58\n\nErcot North EL-PK-ERTN-SNL\n\n37.30\n\n27.00\n\nMid C EL-PK-MIDC-SNL\n\n24.00\n\n24.50\n\nPalo Verde EL-PK-PLVD-SNL\n\n23.75\n\n24.25\n\nSP-15 EL-PK-SP15-SNL\n\n33.25\n\n33.00", "description": "UPDATE 1-U.S. natgas futures hold at two-week low as weather moderates", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6208D_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
