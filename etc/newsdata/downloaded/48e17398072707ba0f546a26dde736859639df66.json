Although, before Uber\u2019s $8 billion initial public offering in May, Uber bond deals were limited in scope, with its earnings, revenue and other financial projections treated as closely-guarded secrets.\n\n\u201cThe first bond deal in October last year wasn\u2019t widely marketed and was only shown to a select group of investors,\u201d said Matthew Kennedy, senior portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors, in an interview with MarketWatch.\n\nThe new debt offering was well known to the market, Kennedy said, and followed a more typical, if shorter one-day, marketing process.\n\nPart of the quick pace came as investors piled some $2 billion of orders into the debt offering, which ultimately included new backers for Uber, said a person familiar with the matter who wasn\u2019t allowed to speak publicly about the private debt placement.\n\nImportantly, unlike prior Uber debt, the new bonds likely will be eligible for inclusion in the sector\u2019s benchmark high-yield bond indexes, the person said.\n\nThe could mean the sector\u2019s two biggest exchange-traded funds SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK, -0.17% and iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG, -0.18% which tend to track benchmarks, will give individual investors their first taste of exposure to Uber debt.\n\nJNK ended Friday 7.93% higher on the year to date, while HYG gained 7.47%, which put both ETFs roughly 12% behind the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.07%.\n\nCheck out: In ETFs, the rich aren\u2019t getting much richer\n\nRiskier assets rallied this week, leaving both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.14% and S&P 500 on Friday within striking distance of fresh all-time highs after Sino-American trade tensions eased and the European Central Bank cut key rates and relaunched its bond purchase program in an effort to shore up the eurozone economy.\n\nS&P gave Uber\u2019s debt offering CCC+ ratings, while Moody\u2019 s rated it one notch higher at B3, both of which are only notches away from being designated \u201cimminent\u201d default risks.\n\nThe financing is a clear win for Uber, which said proceeds would help fund its planned acquisition of Middle East-based hide-sharing company Careem for $3.1 billion in a buyout that is expected to close in January 2020, according to S&P.\n\nStill, it shows increased appetite among debt investors betting on companies sorting out their place in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not adverse to looking at credits that are currently not generating profits and are build-out stories,\u201d said Ken Monaghan, co-director of high yield at Amundi Pioneer, in an interview.\n\n\u201cBut it requires a higher level of due diligence. You are making assumptions about how long it\u2019s going to take for a company to be profitable.\u201d\n\nUber faces \u201cintense competition in all of its servicing lines\u201d and high regulatory risks, \u201cincluding from the potential reclassification of independent drivers and freelancers to employees in various regulated regions,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in its evaluation of the new bond offering.\n\nUber and Lyft LYFT, -1.89% both vowed this week to fight a California bill to extend labor protections to \u201cgig\u201d workers.\n\nMoody\u2019s also said it expected Uber to face another two to three years of operating losses and cash burn.\n\nUber\u2019s shares closed at $33.25 apiece on Friday, down 20% on the year to date, according to FactSet data.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s how much more Lyft and Uber rides could cost under California\u2019s gig-worker law.", "description": "In trading Friday, yields on Uber bonds fell as low as 7.291%, a day after the debt offering saw $2 billion of investor demand.", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR310_uber_ZG_20190913201043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
