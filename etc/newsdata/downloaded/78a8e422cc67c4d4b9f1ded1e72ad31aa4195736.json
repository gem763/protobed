REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s proposals for a Brexit deal were widely rebuffed in Brussels on Thursday, with a European Parliament group saying it was not \u201ca basis for agreement\u201d and a senior EU official saying it took two steps backwards from an earlier agreement.\n\nDiplomats and officials said the offer, made on Wednesday by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, would have to be overhauled to yield a divorce agreement before Britain is due to leave at the end of this month.\n\nWary of being seen as intransigent or being blamed should the increasingly intractable divorce end up in a chaotic no-deal split, the EU initially said it would analyse Johnson\u2019s plan.\n\nBut EU diplomats and officials dealing with Brexit made clear they thought it could be no more than a starting point to more talks.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s executive European Commission - which is leading Brexit talks for the remaining 27 EU member states - is due to quiz British negotiators on their proposals on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt does not contain any decent solution for customs. And it erects a hard border on the island of Ireland,\u201d said the senior EU official.\n\n\u201cIt would have to be fundamentally reworked,\u201d an EU diplomat said, noting that time was short before the bloc\u2019s leaders meet in Brussels in two weeks for a make-or-break Brexit summit.\n\nThe European Parliament\u2019s Brexit Steering Group (BSG) met on Wednesday with the European Commission\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, to discuss the British offer.\n\n\u201cThe initial reaction of the BSG was that these proposals do not represent a basis for an agreement to which the Parliament could give consent by the end of the month,\u201d according to the draft of a statement from the group seen by Reuters.", "description": "Britain's proposals for a Brexit deal were widely rebuffed in Brussels on Thursday, with a European Parliament group saying it was not \"a basis for agreement\" and a senior EU official saying it took two steps backwards from an earlier agreement.", "authors": ["Gabriela Baczynska", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436567253&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920JY"}
