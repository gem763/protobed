He plans to move swiftly too, he told colleagues, using the approach of Christmas to force the Senate to complete its work before the beginning of 2020.\n\nYet an impeachment trial is a spectacle that is by its nature unpredictable, and most of the senators who will act as jurors were not around for the last one, of Bill Clinton in 1999. Mr. McConnell reminded senators that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would preside over the trial, and would have wide latitude in handling motions that might be made, including any motion to dismiss the charges that Republicans might try to put forward to short circuit the process.\n\nMr. McConnell\u2019s declaration that the Senate would move forward was in part designed to show he had no choice, an effort to deflect criticism from conservatives outraged that the Senate would even consider impeachment.\n\nOn Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pushed for Senate Republicans to write a letter to Ms. Pelosi declaring that they would not remove the president. But some senators raised objections, worrying that some of their colleagues would not want to sign on, a result that would expose disunity among Republicans. Mr. Graham\u2019s colleagues said they believe they staved off the letter, which they viewed as a mistake.\n\nMr. McConnell has made it clear that he plans to sit down with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to see if they can find a mutually acceptable way to move forward as Democrats and Republicans did in 1999 when they unanimously agreed on the framework for the impeachment trial. The Senate is much more polarized now, though Mr. Schumer this week held out hope.\n\n\u201cWe have to do this trial in a fair and bipartisan way and I hope that Leader McConnell would obey those strictures,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. In the battle for Senate control, Democrats have their own political risks to consider since impeachment could prompt a backlash against some of their candidates if enough voters conclude that the president was pursued unfairly.\n\nJust 15 senators remain in office from the time Mr. Clinton was put on trial. Mr. McConnell warned them of the weight of the trial, where they can be required to be on the floor all afternoon six days a week without speaking \u2014 a major challenge for senators who relish their chances to be heard.\n\n\u201cIt will mean day after day sitting in chamber, listening to the two sides, writing questions for them to answer that go through the chief justice,\u201d said Ms. Collins, one of the Republicans who voted to acquit Mr. Clinton 20 years ago. \u201cMembers who have not been through this before will find it is a great deal of work.\u201d", "description": "With an eye toward protecting the Republican majority, Senator Mitch McConnell is preparing a serious review of impeachment articles he sees as unavoidable.", "authors": ["Carl Hulse"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/us/politics/18dc-senate/18dc-senate-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
