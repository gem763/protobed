A dupe is a product that in some ways works as well as \u2014 or better than \u2014 a fancier, more famous thing, and we're sharing our favorites. Welcome to Dupes Week.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Retailer\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Dupes Week is over, but we\u2019re reposting this story because this Paddywax candle is finally back in stock.\n\nDiptyque is demonstrably the most iconic candle brand. 4 of the 30 famous people in this roundup are also fans. (TL;DR: Beyonc\u00e9 has her Vanille candles lit, presumably by amply paid butlers, when she\u2019s not home so her pillows smell like vanilla.) This perfumery sits squarely in the Venn diagram cleavage of \u201cevocative to the senses\u201d and \u201cstatus object.\u201d Its uses are also twofold: Whenever a spent Diptyque jar is cleaned out and used to hold makeup brushes, someone in a fashion-adjacent industry gets their wings.\n\nBecause I am not a millionaire, I only buy one Diptyque candle a year. I\u2019m unreasonably precious with it and try to practice good candle form: only lighting it when I have guests over, trimming the wick before each burn, letting the wax melt evenly across the top and then extinguishing it \u2014 normal Patrick Bateman stuff. My go-to scent (Victoria Beckham and Meghan Markle\u2019s, too!) is Figuier. It smells like the entirety of a fig tree \u2014 not just the fruit \u2014 so you get nuances of greenery and bark in addition to pulp. It\u2019s sappy, mellow, and just a touch creamy, so it never comes off as candied. Just green. The wax burns cleanly and evenly with a solid throw, so even when it is unlit on your nightstand, you can catch whiffs when you reach over to turn on your SAD lamp.\n\nPaddywax Urban Candle Fig + Olive - 8 Oz. But what about when you want a folding-the-laundry candle or a doing-the-dishes candle? What do you burn on a Wednesday night of no real significance or after you\u2019ve baked fish? Paddywax Fig & Olive, that\u2019s what. I was gifted this candle a few years ago at Nondenominational Office Gift Exchange. One sniff and I was sold. Its notes include olive leaves, polar, and fig. That\u2019s greenery, bark, and pulp. Sound familiar? It should. To my average nose, it smells identical to Figuier. Rather than coming in a glass vessel, it comes in a concrete block that could approximate a chunk of the Berlin Wall, so anyone with an industrial aesthetic: Raise the roof! While I don\u2019t find it as strong as its high-end cousin, it performs impressively well for such an affordable candle. That means I can light it when I get home from work, even if I have no one to impress. No one other than myself, that is. $22 at Paddywax Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
