In Forest county, in the upper reaches of rural Wisconsin, he\u2019s also torn apart the pocket-sized Republican party.\n\n\u201cI had a really good friend,\u201d said Terri Burl, chair of the county GOP. \u201cShe was vice-chair of the Republican party. I\u2019ve known her for so long. We went to the conventions together. Now she\u2019s a Never Trumper. We don\u2019t speak.\u201d\n\nThe friend, Jennifer Nery, was never a Trump enthusiast but she voted for him as a loyal Republican and under pressure from a sister who was deeply hostile to Hillary Clinton. Now she regards it as a mistake and identifies with the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement in active opposition to the president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always voted Republican. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever voted for a Democrat. I will be voting Democrat in 2020,\u201d said Nery, a semi-retired farmer who looks after rescue animals. \u201cIt\u2019s caused internal strife with some of my family members who said: \u2018Jennifer, but Hillary \u2026\u2019 I voted the least of two evils but now I regret every minute. If could go back in time, I would have cast it for Hillary.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Never Trumper, Jennifer Nery. Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian\n\nThat is not good news for a president who cannot afford to lose voters in Wisconsin and hope to hold on to a state that proved an important part of the electoral college puzzle that put him in the White House.\n\nThe split between the two women reflects a deepening polarisation over the president in the sparsely populated rural county that was among 19 in Wisconsin to flip from backing Obama to supporting Trump in 2016. In doing so, Forest county, which has in recent times consistently backed presidential election winners of either party, helped deliver the president a state he had not expected to win. These Obama-to-Trump swing voters may again prove crucial next year.\n\nBut 2020 offers Trump a different challenge. He took Wisconsin with a huge swing in rural areas but still won by less than 23,000 votes, a margin of just 0.77%. With polls showing rising support for the Democrats in Wisconsin\u2019s main cities, the president not only needs to take rural counties again but increase his backing there to offset his opposition\u2019s gains elsewhere.\n\nIf could go back in time, I would have cast it for Hillary.\n\nThe flipping of counties from Obama to Trump in the midwest \u2013 and the apparent paradox of Americans shifting from Obama to a man denounced as a misogynist, racist and bully \u2013 was instrumental in the president\u2019s victory.\n\nThis week, and at various stages in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is reporting from three midwest counties that swung from Obama to Trump in crucial states.\n\nQ&A What\u2019s the swing voters series about? Show Hide The voters who swung to Trump Voters swung from Barack Obama to Donald Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa in 2016\u2019s presidential election \u2013 helping propel him to a narrow victory.\n\nChris McGreal will report from three key swing voter counties in these states as the 2020 election campaign unfolds, regularly travelling around them, talking to voters, workers, business owners, party activists and strategists.\n\nWill these voters stay with Trump in 2020? Our series will feature regular in depth reporting from: Monroe county, Michigan. Trump won 58% of the vote in 2016 in this mainly white, working class county of around 150,000 people, which is about 25 miles south of Detroit. Some industrial jobs remain in steel and at a nuclear power plant but those who needed to move to find work frequently took non-unionised jobs in healthcare. Forest county, Wisconsin. The northern rural county voted overwhelmingly for Trump having twice backed Barack Obama. In 2008, Obama took 56% of the ballot in the county. Eight years later, Trump won 61%. Howard county, Iowa. One of a bloc of agricultural counties in northeastern Iowa that flipped by large margins and helped deliver the state for Trump. In 2012, it voted 60% for Obama. Four years later, the county went 58% for Trump.\n\nBurl said the county has become so polarised over the president she struggles to get even solid Trump supporters to turn out and campaign for him.\n\n\u201cBehind the scenes they know who they\u2019re going to vote for but people don\u2019t want to say that they\u2019re for Trump. They\u2019re embarrassed to. I\u2019m embarrassed sometimes with things he says and how he says them,\u201d said Burl, a substitute teacher who worked with disabled people and victims of domestic violence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Terri Burl. Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian\n\nAnd now there are the impeachment hearings to contend with. Burl sees Trump\u2019s supporters discounting the investigation as just another witch-hunt in the way that Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation failed to persuade them the president had colluded with the Russians.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t talk about Russia any more. That was $34m of our wasted tax money talking about Russia for two and a half years. Russia didn\u2019t work out for them so now they\u2019re on to the next big inquiry,\u201d she said. \u201cI just think the Democrats wanted to impeach him. From the time he won the election, they started talking about it. Impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.\u201d\n\nBurl doesn\u2019t discount the possibility that revelations down the line may further damage the president\u2019s reputation with some of those who voted for him. But she is sceptical that it will effect many votes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s some big October surprise because we still have a year before the election. I think this would hurt him more if this were happening a year from now. I hate to say this but maybe the Democrats did this at the wrong time,\u201d she said.\n\nJobs\n\nForest county is home to not much more than 9,000 people living across about 1,000 square miles. About 80% of the residents are white and 15% Native American.\n\nBehind the scenes they know who they\u2019re going to vote for but people don\u2019t want to say that they\u2019re for Trump. They\u2019re embarrassed to.\n\nAs in a lot of struggling midwestern counties, the major employers are public service jobs such as heathcare and education alongside manufacturing and the retail trade. But Forest county still has a couple of hundred people employed in forestry and agriculture. Wages are low and the median household income is about $43,000, not much more than two-thirds of the national average. A high proportion of residents are drawing disability payments, a common form of de facto welfare for those below retirement age.\n\nIt\u2019s this unrelieved economic struggle that underpins the surge in votes for Trump in 2016, and Obama before him, as people in Forest county and other parts of rural Wisconsin search for leadership to shift the system in their favour.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Supporters cheer during a campaign rally for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the WL Zorn Arena on 1 November 2016 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

The Democrats have learned from Clinton\u2019s mistake of assuming Wisconsin was a safe bet. She did not visit the state once during her presidential campaign.\n\nDemocrats have been organising. Anger at Trump and increasing activism appears to be strengthening support for the party in cities like Milwaukee and Madison. In last year\u2019s midterms, the Democrats increased their share of the vote in all but one of the state\u2019s seats in the US Congress.\n\nNery has friends who voted for Trump and regret it. But she said voters in Forest county often keep quiet about politics because differences over the president generate so much anger on both sides.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t want to tell whether they\u2019re Republican or Democrat.\u2019\u2019 Burl said that while she believes support for Trump in the county remains firm, she agreed that people are increasingly shy about publicly declaring their backing or dissent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anthony Stover, 28, left, and his brother Joey Stover, 25, wait for Trump to speak in West Allis, Wisconsin, on 3 April 2016.

Trump\u2019s portrayal of asylum seekers flooding across the US\u2019s southern border, and claim that they pose a security threat, as well as his at times vitriolic language to describe immigrants has riled public opinion.\n\n\u201cMy father was born in Greece,\u201d said Burl. \u201cHe came over here and he became a citizen the right way. With people being able to come across the border there is no guarantee that terrorists won\u2019t come across the border either.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear though that the issue is playing as well as Trump would like. A poll by Marquette Law School showed rising tolerance of immigration in the state with 65% saying immigrants make the country a better place while just 4% said they are to the detriment of Wisconsin. Still, the most recent poll showed that nearly one-third of the state\u2019s residents \u201cfeel like strangers in their own country\u201d.\n\nNery thinks Trump is certainly doing things no president has done before but they do not include fulfilling the promises he made to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and put the interests of ordinary Americans first. For the first time in her life, she is scouting out a Democratic candidate to vote for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still a conservative. I don\u2019t want somebody who says Medicare for All [public health insurance] and we\u2019re gonna rip everybody\u2019s guns apart. I actually like Pete Buttigieg. He would be my pick if there was a primary right now because he sounds intelligent and he\u2019s a veteran. I like a military man,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I said this about Pete Buttigieg to my sister, the first thing she said is: \u2018Well, he\u2019s gay. It\u2019s an abomination.\u2019 So is it OK to have relations outside your marriage with another woman? So what about Trump? When I throw that back at my sister all she says is, \u2018He\u2019s gay though.\u2019\u201d\n\nBurl is watching the Democratic primary race with concern.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are worried that some nutjob Democrat is going to win the nomination,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Joe Biden were to win I wouldn\u2019t feel catastrophic about it. But some of the other Democrats are coming out with a lot of crazy ideas. That doesn\u2019t appeal to average Americans, even Democrats. Not in the midwest anyway.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she is not waiting to find out who the opposition candidate is. She\u2019s already gearing up to repeat Trump\u2019s victory in Forest county.\n\n\u201cI want to get a life-size Trump. I want Trump to be in everybody\u2019s mind. Everywhere they look I want them to see Trump over the next year,\u201d she said.", "description": "In his second report on the mood of voters in swing counties which moved from Obama to Trump, Chris McGreal meets Republicans in Forest county in rural Wisconsin where the president has divided old friends", "authors": ["Chris Mcgreal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d83cd3fb4c4990491ec88c8ef458b0bbad12c4e/357_250_4386_2632/master/4386.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4d4126ead8bf22870e3fea3a65fc9537", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
