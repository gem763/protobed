The range increases from between five and nine years under current rules to between eight and 14.\n\n\u2018Failure to disclose information about acts of terrorism\u2019, such as when someone fails to report a friend or relative is involved in planning an atrocity, will also see tougher punishments.\n\nThe starting point will rise from four to seven years, while the upper end of the sentencing range will be nine years instead of four and a half years.\n\nThe Council, a statutory body which sets punishment levels to be followed by judges, said the changes were necessary after the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act received Royal Assent in February.\n\nThe starting point of a sentence is where a judge must begin before considering aggravating factors, which would lead to a longer term, or mitigating factors, which could lead to a discount.\n\nFurther changes announced today allow judges to sentence someone for \u2018streaming\u2019 terrorism material online, as previous laws focussed on possession of an electronic copy of a video or audio file.\n\nUnder the moves, the \u2018starting point\u2019 for judges when jailing someone for \u2018encouragement of terrorism\u2019 will double to ten years in the worst cases. Pictured: The Old Bailey\n\nA spokesman said it was \u2018intended to reflect the rapid changes to offending in the online world\u2019.\n\nSentencing Council member Mr Justice Julian Goose said: \u2018Terrorism offences are extremely serious and can cover a wide range of factual circumstances, making them difficult and sensitive offences to sentence.\n\n\u2018For this reason, the Council is keen to ensure that the guidelines are kept up to date and fit for purpose.\n\n\u2018These revised guidelines will ensure consistency and transparency in the sentencing of these offences.\u2019\n\nThe consultation runs until December 3, with the sentencing changes due to take effect early next year.", "description": "The Sentencing Council will propose changes to its guidelines after Parliament passed a new anti-terror law earlier this year which allowed for longer terms of imprisonment.
