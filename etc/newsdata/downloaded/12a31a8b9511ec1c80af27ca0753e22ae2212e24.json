But Carlson and others like him have chosen the easier and more damaging method of handling disagreement via a constant game of \u201cno true Scotsman.\u201d Instead of admitting fault, error, or even simple differences of opinion within their own camp \u2014 and different policy preferences unquestionably can develop from a set of ideological underpinnings unified enough to fund a single movement \u2014 they relabel anything objectionable as the property of their political enemies.\n\nFor this crowd, to have a bad position is to have a liberal position. If you\u2019re not with us, you\u2019re against us. To err is to be a Democrat. For Carlson, if Bolton is a disaster on foreign policy, that proves Bolton is a left-winger.\n\nThe specific argument Carlson used is worth a moment\u2019s digression. After months of carping about \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d and how the government should make social media be nicer to conservatives and defend the institution of the family against the ravages of the market, suddenly Carlson has rediscovered a trace of his old libertarian streak. \u201cThere was not a human problem John Bolton wasn\u2019t totally convinced could be solved with the brute force of government,\u201d he announced Tuesday, disregarding Bolton\u2019s stated positions on subjects like the economy and firearms. \u201cThat\u2019s an assumption of the left, not the right.\u201d Of late, it\u2019s an assumption Carlson and his allies in \u201cnationalist conservatism\u201d tend to make. (See, for example, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and his plans for internet regulation.) But Carlson\u2019s new faith in the state doesn\u2019t follow Bolton into the foreign policy arena, so he summons a bit of anti-statist fire to force Bolton out into the cold.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bonnie Kristian", "Theweek.Com Articles Rights-Refusal-Look-Mirror"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
