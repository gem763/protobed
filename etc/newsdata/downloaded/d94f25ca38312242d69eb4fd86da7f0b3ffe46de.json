Now, what matters is how we will work together as of tomorrow, in order to solve our problems.\"\n\nAnastasiades appears to have won the confidence of voters after containing the island's 2013 economic crisis\n\nOne supporter said, \"He inspires trust in investors and in general and at the beginning when he started five years ago things were bad but now things are improving so we don't need any other changes.\"\n\n\"Since he managed to get through the first hard five years, I think that the next five years will be easier for him to implement what he promised the people, for the poor people, for pensions.\"\n\nSeen as a pro-settlement candidate Anastasiades is also likely to want to resume failed peacetalks with the Turkish Cypriot controlled north .\n\nEuronews reporter Efi Koutsokosta explained what is now facing the winner:\n\n\"During his first mandate Nikos Anastasiades goal was to get his country out of a deep financial crisis. Today he defeated for the second time the same rival. Tomorrow he will have to deal with the economic problems that remain but also with the restart of the longstanding Cypriot dispute.\"", "description": "Nicos Anastasiades beats rival for a second time as voters approve his handling of the island's once crisis hit economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/07/09/36/1000x563_story-501b36a5-c413-57b4-9ee0-9b535fa2c633_678651.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-05"}
