As some previous Supremes under the leadership of chief justice Diana Ross almost put it, they just keep us hangin\u2019 on.\n\nBut they can\u2019t keep us hangin\u2019 on forever. Within the next few days, possibly on Monday, the 11 justices will rule on the legality or otherwise of the Johnson-Cummings prorogation.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe mounting assumption among legal experts following the case is that the majority will plump for otherwise.\n\nEven in this age of wonderment, I find that hard to believe. The prospect of the Supremes confirming the Scottish court of appeal and finding against the government is astonishing.\n\nSenior British judges are not revolutionaries. They are by nature and custom the apotheosis of what we still choose to capitalise as The Establishment.\n\nThey have an endemic phobia of controversy. They exist as much to maintain the status quo as to make new law. In contrast to their American equivalents, who are minutely inspected before their sexual misdemeanours are ignored and they are allowed to join the bench, they are blanketed in such obscurity that almost nothing is known of their private lives.\n\nBeing the centre of attention is anathema. They hate controversy and never showboat. However they vote, whatever their political beliefs, they are utterly, immutably and reliably apolitical.\n\nThese points may seem too obvious to state, and in serener times they would be. But if the Supremes do decide that Johnson acted beyond his (and even Cummings\u2019) powers by shuttering the Commons \u2013 that the motive was not to enable a Queen\u2019s Speech, but to subvert the democratic process \u2013 these points will want remembering when the inevitable barrage of mendacity is unleashed against them.\n\nIn that event, The Sun, Daily Telegraph, Express and Mail will refashion the Supremes into embittered emblems of the Remainer resistance. These dusty, desiccated souls will be reborn as the Fidel Castros of the bench. Once again they will again be elegantly styled as the enemies of the people, hell-bent on stymying the democratic will by averting Brexit.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The scavenger hunt for signs of pro-European partisanship will root out nothing more than the fact that one of them owns an Umbrian villa, or another was overheard absentmindedly humming Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde To Joy\u201d, the EU anthem, during an especially tedious case about a fine point of maritime law.\n\nIf Lady Hale, the court\u2019s soon-to-retire, 74-year-old leader, was once spotted ordering escargots in a bistro, it will be adduced as evidence that she was implanted into the judiciary long ago under deepest cover as a long-term sleeper for a federated Europe.\n\nIf Lord Carnwath, also 74 and a product of the breeding ground for revolutionary activism that is Eton College, finds for Gina Miller et al, his fellow Old Etonian Kwasi Kwarteng will take to the airwaves to reveal that many (not himself, but lots and lots of other people) suspect him of liberal lefty leanings on the compelling grounds that he is Lord Carnwath of Notting Hill. Oh, and according to his Wikipedia entry, he sings in the Bach Choir. \u2019Nuff said there.\n\nAnd if they do adapt the title of another Supremes hit to tell this PM \u201cStop! In the name of law!\u201d, what then?\n\nAn unnamed \u201csenior legal figure\u201d is quoted elsewhere referring to that outcome as a \u201cconstitutional eruption of volcanic proportions\u201d.\n\nThis, to be pedantic, is nonsense. There can be so such thing in a country without a constitution. In the phrase \u201cunwritten constitution\u201d, the word unwritten has the identical meaning as the word \u201cgentle\u201d in that classic Radio Times formulation: \u201cLast of the Summer Wine: another welcome run out for Roy Clarke\u2019s gentle comedy\u201d. It means \u201cno\u201d.\n\nBut a volcanic eruption there will be, and certain politicians and their media allies will be queueing impatiently to pour propane on the lava.\n\nIain Duncan Smith will be wheeled on to comment pages of The Telegraph to portray the Supreme Court as a febrile swamp of anarchistic mayhem.\n\nDelegating the slandering of the judiciary to his distempered attack dogs, Johnson will proclaim his absolute belief in the rule of law. He will then, according to well informed observers, ignore the judgment entirely and seek to re-prorogue parliament at the earliest opportunity.\n\nWhere we go from that point, if we reach it, is anyone\u2019s guess. None of us, as Jeremy Corbyn amusingly sought to explain his self-proclaimed ignorance about the plot against Tom Watson to Andrew Marr this morning, is all-knowing and all-seeing. Even at this advanced stage of our demented civil war, none of us knows nuffink or sees five minutes into the future.\n\nBut one thing we do know (hide the knowledge from our readers though some of us may) is that our Supremes are not judicial activists like their US counterparts.\n\nIt will go directly against their instincts to find against the government, and agonise them to be falsely politicised. If they summon the courage to smash the status quo in accord with the law as they intrepret it, they will deserve more universal respect and gratitude than they can possibly expect to receive.", "description": "If the experts know a bit more than Michael Gove would have us believe, the next staging post on the road to hell is imminent.", "authors": ["Matthew Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/18/supreme-court-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
