In contrast, around 89 million acres of soybeans were planted in the U.S. last year \u2014 in the thick of the trade war \u2014 according to the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\n\"It would certainly help us regain lost share in the Chinese market, which is obviously important to us,\" Sutter told CNBC's Squawk Box.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade war, which has lasted more than a year, has seen both countries impose levies on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods. That has escalated tensions and hurt the global economic outlook.\n\nCrucially, they've slashed exports of soybeans, the most valuable U.S. crop. While the country remained the largest importer of U.S. soybeans, the American Farm Bureau said that exports to China plummeted 53% in the 2018-2019 marketing year.\n\nDespite Sutter's optimistic tone, agriculture industry analysts said China is still a long way from forking out $50 billion for farm goods from the U.S.\n\n\"I think it's a meaningless big number, thrown out to get headlines, and won't happen,\" one commodity analyst told Reuters on Monday.\n\nBut Sutter said he's \"a little more optimistic\" about the recent agreement between Washington and Beijing.\n\n\"I have a sense that perhaps this time is different. I really think that both sides came to these negotiations wanting to make a deal, and I think the timing is right for that to happen,\" Sutter said.", "description": "The trade war has pummeled farmers of the most valuable U.S. crop, as exports to China plummeted 53% in the 2018-2019 marketing year.", "authors": ["Stella Soon"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105350197-1532465828093gettyimages-973885174.jpeg?v=1571202740", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
