It prompted assurances from all echelons of the industry that practices would be revised, but there are those who argue that the problem has not gone away and there is still a long way to go.\n\n\u201cSome big names have disappeared but there are still photographers who are big flirts and really push it,\u201d says Cyril Brul\u00e9, the chair of France\u2019s National Union of Modelling Agencies and founder of Viva Model Management. Reports of photographers harassing models on Instagram for dates, becoming obsessed with their private lives and being aggressive to get the shots they want are among the complaints still being received.\n\nWhile Brul\u00e9 says his team will not allow models on its books to work with some photographers and briefs them on what is not acceptable, he says it is difficult to achieve widespread control, especially when some of the brands booking the offenders are often small, new companies who \u201chave no idea\u201d about their reputation.\n\nVanessa Friedman, the fashion director at the New York Times whose January 2018 investigation named Testino and Weber \u2013 who have both denied the allegations levelled against them \u2013 said: \u201cWe are at a reflection point and it isn\u2019t easy or simple and I think it is going to take a lot of wrestling and mistakes and reminders.\u201d\n\nHaving found during her research that everyone \u201cpasses the buck\u201d, Friedman is resolute that all parts of the industry need to identify their complicity.\n\n\u201cThe modelling agencies say it\u2019s the brands who book the photographers, the brands say it\u2019s the stylists responsibility because they want to work with [certain] photographers, the photographers say it\u2019s the agent\u2019s responsibility as they should be protecting the models ... if every part of the supply chain, which is complicated and convoluted, doesn\u2019t take responsibility for their own actions and space, then it isn\u2019t going to change,\u201d she said.\n\nFriedman\u2019s team was not alone in exposing alleged abusers. In October 2017, the model Cameron Russell took a stand when she shared stories of abuse from more than 60 models on her Instagram account with the hashtag #MyJobShouldNotIncludeAbuse. Harrowing accounts dated back years and ranged from suggestive and uncomfortable language to models being raped on set.\n\nThe Boston Globe\u2019s spotlight team early last year revealed the names of 25 fashion industry professionals who had been accused of sexual misconduct. It spoke with more than 50 models, 60% of whom said they had been \u201ctouched inappropriately during work-related situations, the violations ranging from unwanted kissing to rape\u201d. All of the men accused denied the allegations against them.\n\nSince the #MeToo movement began, there have been a number of safeguards put in place to prevent sexual abuse as well as structures to support alleged victims. In early 2018, the owners of Vogue, Cond\u00e9 Nast, released a set of guidelines for photoshoots that prohibit \u201csexual advances or propositions\u201d and \u201cany type of sexual activity or contact\u201d.\n\nThe Model Alliance (MA) \u2013 formed by the model Sara Ziff in 2012 \u2013 received more than 100 calls to its hotline between October 2017 and July 2018 reporting sexual harassment and assault, and in May 2018 launched The Respect Programme, a legally binding agreement to protect models and end sexual harassment within the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, in September 2017, the LVMH and Kering published the Model Charter, which became a central mandate in making \u201cmodels [feel] that the clients were caring about them for the first time\u201d, according to Brul\u00e9, who helped draft it. But, he adds, the charter\u2019s own hotline was dropped as it was not used \u2013 from what he perceives as a continued fear from models of being blacklisted by brands.\n\nJeni Rose, the senior vice-president of IMG Models, who also consulted on the charter, said the #MeToo movement presented an \u201copportunity for us to extend these protections beyond our own client base and to encourage the professionalisation of the industry as a whole\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur conversations with industry stakeholders like LVMH, Kering and Cond\u00e9 Nast have led to tangible measures to protect talent \u2013 a first for the industry, and an important step toward ideological and behavioural change.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cWe have heard that a greater awareness of and attention to standards has percolated throughout the industry and models\u2019 work environments, and that talent feel more empowered to call out behaviour that might have previously been ignored.\u201d", "description": "Industry insiders say progress has been made but problem of sexual abuse has not gone away", "authors": ["Scarlett Conlon"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ebbffb94db9b529dde4fc9f5e26ce963c8d97a9/0_232_3861_2317/master/3861.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d4357813b60f47a479f5958163cd3b3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
