(David J. Phillip/AP)\n\nThere was almost a defensiveness when ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos informed the candidates participating in Thursday night\u2019s third Democratic debate that they would spend some more time on health care. The subject is the one of most concern to voters, he explained, somewhat apologetically, so they were going to let all 10 candidates offer some thoughts.\n\nIn a vacuum, that makes sense. In practice, though? Each of the other debates in which the candidates have participated similarly included lengthy discussions of health-care policy at the outset. Yes, this was the first debate in which the three polling leaders \u2014 former vice president Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) \u2014 were onstage together. But the conversation wasn\u2019t dramatically different from the ones that preceded it. A lot of \u201chow will you pay for this\u201d versus \u201cit will reduce costs for families overall\u201d that those who\u2019ve watched have already seen \u2014 and which for those just tuning in was probably a level of detail deeper than would be revelatory.\n\nThe effect of focusing so intently on this one topic over and over is to leave less space for other also-important subjects. Shortly after Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) got offstage, her Twitter account noted the lack of discussion about reproductive rights. There was, however, another round of let\u2019s-mention-our-Medicare-for-X-plans, to everyone\u2019s delight.\n\nBy our count, there were 10 different topics discussed, grouped together fairly broadly. The flow of the evening\u2019s almost three hours looked something like this.\n\nThe Sept. 12 debate\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWe\u2019ve indicated an extended interruption at the tail end of the debate, when Biden was interrupted by immigration protesters.\n\nThere were only two ad breaks, which was nice in theory, though 90 minutes of discussing relatively nuanced policy details does tend to make one nostalgic for the mindless respite of advertising. (Though ABC\u2019s inclusion of a spot promoting Sean Spicer\u2019s \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d seemed an odd fit for the programming.)\n\nContrast that flow with the two-night debate at the end of the July.\n\nThe July 30\u201431 debate: Night 1\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nNight 2\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nYou might have noticed that health care came up then, too.\n\nNot every candidate got a chance to address every topic. The Washington Post has a tally of the overall time each candidate got to speak, but we broke that down roughly by subject, as well.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe most discussion by a candidate on one subject? Biden on health care, in part a function of his responding to comments from Sanders and Warren.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas weighed in on the fewest subjects, but each made a splash when given the chance.\n\nO\u2019Rourke spoke directly about removing AR-15 and AK-47 rifles from American homes, generating some attention on social media. It was a moment of strength, leveraging the tragedy that struck his hometown of El Paso shortly after the last Democratic debate.\n\nKlobuchar, for her part, made a corny joke about the location of the debate \u2014 Houston; you can probably guess the joke if you try \u2014 earning some groans. But, hey, groans are attention, right?\n\nThis is where we say that the debate probably didn\u2019t change anything, because that\u2019s the safe thing to say and it has the happy tendency to be accurate. If, however, the debate had explored subjects that hadn\u2019t been covered over and over, who knows? Maybe the foundation would have shaken a little more and the sorts of voters who watch these things \u2014 who, we\u2019d guess, are more likely to have seen more than one debate than to just be tuning in for the first time \u2014 might learn a few additional policy positions.", "description": "Policy-detail-ophiles had another enjoyable night.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7K4cx4ncn3YzfL5CVN48sux1Eog=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NRP4QLWV2EI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
