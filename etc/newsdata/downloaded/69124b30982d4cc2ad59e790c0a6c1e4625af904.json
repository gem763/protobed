Video evidence caught Kraft paying for sexual services at Asia Day Spa in Juniper, Florida, the police told reporters.\n\nRead more: Patriots owner Robert Kraft charged with 2 counts of soliciting prostitution\n\nPolice had been conducting a months-long investigation into human trafficking at Florida spas. While investigators were focusing on illegal human trafficking, the prosecutor for Kraft's case conceded there was no evidence to substantiate their suspicions that human trafficking occurred.\n\n\"It's manifestly obvious to us that this is human trafficking, but without the evidentiary piece of a victim's testimony we could not prevail in court,\" Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told Business Insider's Benjamin Goggin.\n\nRudd has said he thought to use Brady in the show due to his \"excellence\" as a football player. In the show, Rudd asks Brady how many times he's visited the spa and Brady says six \u2014 the number of times he's won a Super Bowl.\n\n\"That's the perfect person to use,\" Rudd told USA Today earlier this week. \"Nobody seemed to check every box like Tom Brady. He's the epitome of excellence in just about every category.\"\n\nSome fans on Twitter, however, thought the tongue-in-cheek cameo made light of Kraft's prostitution and potential sex trafficking charge.\n\n\"I absolutely cannot believe Tom Brady agreed to do this,\" CBS sportswriter Pete Blackburn wrote.\n\nBrady told reporters on Saturday the media took his Netflix cameo out of context, and that he and Kraft have a good relationship. He added he \"sympathizes\" with what Kraft has gone through in life.\n\n\"It's unfortunate people think I would choose to do something like that about Mr. Kraft,\" Brady said. \"I think everybody knows what our relationships about. 20 years, it's nothing but love and respect.\"", "description": "Patriots owner Robert Kraft was charged for soliciting prostitution at a massage spa in Florida earlier this year.", "authors": ["Allana Akhtar"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dab51fd4af90973a36ffeb2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
