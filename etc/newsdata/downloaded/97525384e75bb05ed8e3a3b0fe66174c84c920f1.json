The House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are leading the investigation.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, described Trump\u2019s move to prevent Sondland from testifying as \u201cobstruction.\u201d\n\nNBC News surveyed all 235 Democrat members of the House about whether or nor Sondland should resign.\n\n\u201cMany of the lawmakers said they were withholding judgment until Sondland testifies Tuesday and urged him to fully cooperate with the committees, warning that failure to do so would amount to obstruction,\u201d NBC News noted.\n\nOverall, 12 members of the House Democratic Caucus called for Sondland\u2019s resignation. More House Democrats likely came out in support of Sondland stepping down after he opted not to testify.\n\nNBC News identified the Democrat representatives calling for Sondland\u2019s resignation as Reps. Tim Ryan (OH), Lloyd Doggett (TX), Gerry Connolly (VA), Bennie Thompson (MS), Denny Heck (WA), Filemon Vela (TX), David Price (NC), Bonnie Watson Coleman (N.J), Anthony Brown (MD), Dwight Evans (PA), Julia Brownley (CA) and Gwen Moore (WI).\n\nOn September 27, U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker resigned from his post amid the impeachment inquiry. This week, Volker also stepped down as the executive director of the McCain Institute.\n\nSondland and Volker got caught in the middle of the ongoing impeachment investigation.\n\nThe \u201cwhistleblower\u201d report that triggered the impeachment inquiry mentions Sondland, saying he tried to help urge Ukraine to investigate Biden.\n\nBoth Volker and Sondland played a role in getting Ukraine to help with probes into corruption allegations linked to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nVolker explained to House leaders they were pushing Ukraine to investigate domestic energy company Burisma Holdings, not Biden.\n\n\u201c[A]t no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden,\u201d Volker said.\n\nHis comments came in the form of written testimony prepared for his deposition last week.\n\nAs vice president, Biden pushed Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who was investigating the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky.\n\nAt the time, Hunter was serving on the board of Burisma, prompting allegations of corruption.\n\nVolker and Sondland also sought Ukraine\u2019s help in investigating the Russian collusion hoax.\n\nSondland said in a text message that there was \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind\u201d between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe text message contradicts the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that Trump threatened to withhold aid if Ukraine refused to investigate Biden and his son.\n\nVolker provided a series of text messages to congressional investigators.\n\nHe described the communication exchange as evidence that the Trump administration did not coerce Ukraine into investigating the Bidens in exchange for aid, the claim behind the impeachment inquiry.\n\nNevertheless, the Democrats released what they described as a \u201csubset\u201d of the texts, arguing the complete opposite, saying Volker and Sondland helped bully Ukraine.", "description": "A dozen Democrats in the House are calling for Gordon Sondland to step down amid the unfolding impeachment inquiry scandal linked to Ukraine.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Gordon-Sondland-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
