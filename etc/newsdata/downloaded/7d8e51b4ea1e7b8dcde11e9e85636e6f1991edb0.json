President Donald Trump aims to resolve longstanding concerns about Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property and forced technology transfers, and secure more Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump announced the sides reached a \"very substantial phase one deal\" to be finalized over three weeks. He said the agreement would address issues including intellectual property and financial services, and include a pledge for China to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in American agricultural products.\n\nTrump called it a \"tremendous deal for the farmers\" as he tries to contain damage from Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. crops.\n\nThe Trump administration also ditched a planned tariff hike on $250 billion in Chinese goods that was set to take effect Oct. 15. Reports suggested Beijing also wanted the U.S. to abandon another tariff increase set for December.\n\nDespite Trump's public optimism about an agreement, doubts lingered in recent days about the countries' ability to ink a deal. Chinese state media had cautioned about becoming too hopeful about progress toward a deal.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told CNBC that \"it's been very difficult to get the Chinese to admit the they agreed to what has been reported they agreed to.\" \ufeff", "description": "The U.S. and China \"made headway on specific issues\" during trade talks among top negotiators Friday, the USTR said.", "authors": ["Jacob Pramuk"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106176978-1570803281092he.jpg?v=1570803300", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
