Android 10 makes it super easy to pair either controller, too, and you can pair with previous versions of Android and iOS as well.\n\nThis is probably of particular interest If you subscribe to Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass, as you can play several of the games on offer from either service with a controller. Fortnite paved the way for expanding controller support when it arrived on select phones, but the PS4 and Xbox controllers (though not all Xbox controllers) work on mobile with more games than ever, and crucially, many of those games offer native support for their button layouts.\n\nThe process for setting up the DualShock 4 and Xbox wireless controller with your device is simple, but the details of the setup vary a bit depending on which controller you have, and what operating system that you\u2019ll be pairing the controller to. We\u2019re going to hit all of the variables below.\n\nFirst, put your controller into pairing mode\n\nNo matter what kind of device you pair Sony\u2019s DualShock 4 with, you\u2019ll first need to put the controller into pairing mode. To do this, press and hold its \u201cShare\u201d button to the left of the touchpad, then also hold the middle \u201cPlayStation\u201d button. The light bar at the top of the controller will start to blink, an indicator that it\u2019s looking for a device to pair up with.\n\nIf you have an Xbox wireless controller, first ensure that it\u2019s Bluetooth-ready. There\u2019s an easy way to tell just by looking at it: if your gamepad has a glossy plastic surrounding the Xbox button, it won\u2019t work. However, if that region is made of the same matte plastic as the face of the controller (as shown in the picture above), it will.\n\nTo enter pairing mode, turn on the controller by holding down the Xbox button in the middle. Once it lights up, click and hold the connect button on the top of the controller, near the bumpers, until the Xbox logo blinks. This indicates that you\u2019re ready to pair.\n\nHow to pair your controller with iOS\n\nOpen the \u201cSettings\u201d app, and then tap the Bluetooth option near the top of the page. When your DualShock 4 or Xbox controller is in pairing mode, you\u2019ll find it listed as \u201cDUALSHOCK4 Wireless Controller\u201d or \u201cXbox Wireless Controller,\u201d respectively.\n\nTap whichever option applies to you. Once it\u2019s successfully paired, the light bar on the top of the DualShock 4 will turn pink. The Xbox controller\u2019s backlit middle button will stop blinking and remain illuminated.\n\nIf you\u2019re using an iPad with iPadOS, follow these same steps to connect either controller.\n\nOn Apple TV (running tvOS 13)\n\nOpen the \u201cSettings\u201d app on the Apple TV home screen, and then scroll down to \u201cRemotes and Devices\u201d and click into that option.\n\nScroll down until you find \u201cBluetooth\u201d, and then click into it. A handy resource called \u201cHow to pair game controllers\u201d will be the first option on the next page. Read if you need to, but otherwise, if your controller is in pairing mode, it will appear under the \u201cOther Devices\u201d section of this Bluetooth connection screen.\n\nOnce your controller is connected, you can use it in place of Apple\u2019s included remote.\n\nOn Android\n\nIt has been possible to pair Bluetooth controllers to Android phones in software versions prior to Android 10, but Google\u2019s latest update recognizes controllers faster. And, as a bonus for Android 10 users who sync up a DualShock 4, the touchpad can be used as a mouse pointer for the OS, as well as in-game, in case you don\u2019t want to navigate with the analog stick. It\u2019s cool!\n\n(Note: these steps will vary slightly depending on the phone that you use.)\n\nIf you\u2019re using a Pixel on Android 10, navigate to the \u201cSettings\u201d app, then click \u201cConnected Devices\u201d. Finally, you can find and pair your controller by selecting \u201cPair new device\u201d. the DualShock 4 will appear as \u201cWireless Controller\u201d, while the Xbox controller will simply be called \u201cXbox Wireless Controller\u201d.\n\nOn Android 10, the DualShock 4\u2019s light bar turns blue to indicate that it has been set up successfully, and the Xbox controller\u2019s backlit middle button remains illuminated while it\u2019s connected to your phone.\n\nIf you\u2019re using an older version of Android, like Android 7 Nougat, or Android 8 Oreo, you may have to drill down into a Bluetooth sub-menu from within the \u201cConnected Devices\u201d setting to pair a controller.", "description": "The DualShock 4 and Xbox One controllers were originally made to work on their respective consoles, but thanks to Apple and Google\u2019s recent software updates, you can more easily pair them via Bluetooth to your device.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Oct", "The Dualshock", "Xbox One Controllers Were Originally Made To Work On Their Respective Consoles", "But Thanks To Apple S Recent Software Updates", "You Can More Easily Pair Them Via Bluetooth With Your"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyWM6NrTPfF4o58FWsLN1s6agzA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13712119/akrales_190123_3174_0066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
