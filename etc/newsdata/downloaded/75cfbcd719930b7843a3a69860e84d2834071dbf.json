In addition, the company was edging closer to next year\u2019s eBay Inc. EBAY, -8.70% contract expiration, at which point the digital payments giant will be relegated to a more minor role on eBay\u2019s platform. The stock had lost 20% in between PayPal\u2019s June-quarter report and the September-quarter one it delivered on Wednesday.\n\nAnalysts liked what they heard from the company this time around, however, as management projected that the delayed pricing and partner implementations that PayPal highlighted on its prior call were on track for full integration by the end of 2019. At the same time, the company provided new clarity on its expectations for the eBay revenue roll-off while emphasizing that the site represents a shrinking portion of PayPal\u2019s overall volume, at 8% as of the third quarter.\n\nSee more: PayPal stock surges after earnings beat across the board\n\nThe stock is up nearly 8% in Thursday morning trading.\n\n\u201cManagement noted that it expects the eBay revenue contribution to be 6% by the contract termination next year, and that it would see a step down of remaining volume over time - with a 50% expected long-term retention,\u201d Jefferies analyst John Hecht wrote. \u201cIn all, the company sees a 1% headwind to revenue from this next year. These details were largely consistent with our expectations, and we believe they will be considered constructively as they appear both manageable and as the clarity increases financial visibility.\u201d\n\nHe rates the stock a buy with a $140 target price.\n\nRaymond James analyst John Davis wrote that while the headwinds from eBay \u201cwill certainly increase in 2021,\u201d PayPal is gaining more time to find other revenue sources that can dilute eBay\u2019s impact further. He also called the company\u2019s initial forecast for 2020 \u201cbetter than feared\u201d due to a more minimal initial eBay impact than some had been predicting. The company is calling for 17% revenue growth next year after adjusting for currency impacts.\n\nCaso rates the stock at outperform with a $122 target.\n\nPayPal won praise for its current financial performance as well, with Susquehanna analyst Jamie Friedman highlighting that the company sported its best operating margin expansion since splitting from eBay in 2015.\n\nWrote Friedman: \u201cHow did they do it? Non-transaction related expenses grew just 1.9%, or just 4 cents for every dollar increase in revenue... profiling the low marginal costs and scaleability of the business. At the same time, transaction losses declined 4 basis points year over year to just 14 basis points, reflecting better risk management.\u201d\n\nHe has a positive rating and $120 price target on the stock.\n\nVisa earnings preview: Moving further beyond credit cards\n\nRamsey El-Assal of Barclays said that PayPal was \u201cmoving back into the fast lane\u201d as it posted an acceleration in payment volume growth while also showing greater engagement and user numbers. He rates the stock at overweight with a $127 price target.\n\nFor Bernstein\u2019s Harshita Rawat, however, the results didn\u2019t merit a jump to the bull camp. She argued that hedging gains and credit outperformance were partly responsible for PayPal\u2019s revenue beat while pricing and partnerships might not deliver the level of upside that others were hoping.\n\nShe also keyed in on the company\u2019s disclosure that Venmo is now on track for a nearly $400 million annual revenue run rate.\n\n\u201cWhile it is encouraging to see PayPal disclose metrics on Venmo again and multiple levers for monetization (e.g.,. the new Venmo credit card), we believe that pace of Venmo monetization remains below investor expectations\u2014and also believe that \u2018Pay with Venmo\u2019 (the biggest long-term opportunity) has been slower than expected,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe $400 million annual run-rate revenue is in-line with investor expectations.\u201d\n\nRawat has a market-perform rating and a $110 price target on PayPal\u2019s shares.\n\nRead: Microsoft\u2019s stock surges as big earnings beat prompts analysts to boost price targets\n\nOf the 43 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover PayPal\u2019s stock, 33 have buy ratings and 10 have hold ratings. The average price target listed is $125.82, about 20% above recent levels.\n\nPayPal\u2019s stock has risen 24% so far this year, as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.27% has gained 20%.", "description": "PayPal Holdings Inc. soothed some key investor fears with its latest earnings commentary, helping to send shares higher in Thursday trading.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GC831_paypal_ZG_20180201074726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
