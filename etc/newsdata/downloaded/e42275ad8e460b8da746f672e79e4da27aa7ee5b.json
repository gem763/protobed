It\u2019s just not right.\u201d\n\nGropper has also teamed up with ReHire Colorado which is a transitional employment program run by the Colorado Department of Human Services. The program places individuals in a job with the Full Battle Rattle Deli and also pays them a salary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 11 weeks in the food truck, where they\u2019ll get a salary, and after 11 weeks we\u2019ll help find them employment in the community,\u201d Gropper said.\n\nIn January, the National Alliance to End Homelessness stated that the number of homeless veterans had decreased by 48.4 percent since 2009.\n\n\u201cSignificant progress has been made in housing our nation\u2019s homeless veterans. This is due, in large part, to connecting them with rapid re-housing, through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program, and permanent supportive housing, through the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH),\u201d the website said.\n\nOn September 25, Breitbart News reported that veteran unemployment had also decreased drastically, thanks to a strong economy.\n\nThe report continued:\n\nLast year, both male and female veterans showed a significantly lower jobless rate than their non-veteran counterparts: 3.5 percent against 3.7 percent for men, and 3 percent versus 4 percent for women. As of 2017, male veterans drew a median of about $51,000 in annual income, versus $40,000 for their civilian counterparts. For women, the salary difference stood at $41,000 over $30,000.\n\nHalsey said the new program is a great opportunity for veterans struggling to find work and added that they need to get more people involved in the effort.\n\nGropper echoed his statement and said \u201cFor so many months, this was just a project. And now it\u2019s become a reality and that means a lot to me. It\u2019s time to make a difference. Time to make a change. This is called a vehicle for change.\u201d\n\nThe Full Battle Rattle Deli will be serving food during the Denver Veteran\u2019s Day parade on November ninth, according to BusinessDen.com.", "description": "A U.S. Army veteran in Aurora, Colorado, is helping his fellow servicemen learn job skills to get them back on their feet.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/american-flag-waving-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
