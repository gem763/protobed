Massive selling on the Shanghai Gold Exchange helped to drive down prices by four percent. China and India are the world\u2019s top gold buyers and the subcontinent accounts for more than a fifth of global demand.\n\nAt one of New Delhi\u2019s leading jewellery markets traders have seen a modest rise in demand.\n\n\u201cEver since the gold prices have fallen there has been an increase of nearly 20-25 percent in our business. It is only because the gold prices have come down,\u201d explained Praveen Goel,managing director of the Sunar Jewel House.\n\nGold edged up from the five year low on Thursday but the modest gains suggest investors are still hovering in the market.\n\nMany Indian jewellers sent texts to their clients encouraging them to buy gold and offering to cut the cost of making it into jewellery.\n\n\u201cGold prices have come down, so I think that this is the right time to buy. I have come to buy gold as an investment for the future,\u201d said one shopper.\n\nMany believe the price could fall further one reason being the expectations of higher interest rates in the US.
