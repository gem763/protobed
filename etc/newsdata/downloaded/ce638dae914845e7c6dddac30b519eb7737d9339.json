'We will always be grateful for the love we've shared and will always work together to raise our two beautiful dogs.'\n\nAs they were: Christina Hendricks announces split from actor Geoffrey Arend after 12 years of marriage; the couple are seen a year ago at an event in Pacific Palisades\n\n'So much love': Geoffrey with the couple's two dogs back in July of this year\n\nThey began the post: 'Twelve years ago we fell in love and became partners. We joined our two amazing families, had countless laughs, made wonderful friends and were blessed with incredible opportunities.'\n\nAnd the couple asked for space to 'rediscover ourselves' during the split.\n\n'We will be taking time to rediscover ourselves in this transition and we thank you for your patience and support in giving us the space to do so.'\n\nSplit: Taking to Instagram, the Mad Men star and her husband each shared an identical post confirming they had gone their separate ways\n\nThe two married in New York in 2009. They have no children together.\n\nBack in 2012 Christina recalled how she 'freaked out' Arend when she told the 500 Days Of Summer actor she wanted a family with him soon after they met in 2007.\n\nHendricks and Arend were introduced by her Mad Men co-star Vincent Kartheiser - and she said she found herself immediately drawn to him.\n\nChristina told the UK edition of Cosmopolitan in the interview: 'Geoffrey walked in and I was like, \"Who is this guy?\" He had amazing hair and was all disheveled - he was running late and everyone was waiting for him. He just came in with this very high energy.\n\nWedding day: Christina and Arend are pictured at their Il Buco wedding in October 2009\n\n'He was just charming, funny and very magnetic. I got his number that night under the pretence of, \"We could just be friends.\" And of course I immediately went home and Googled him.'\n\nAfter a few weeks of the pair meeting as part of a group, they finally had a date, and then it was Hendricks who said the L word first.\n\nShe said: 'I cracked it out in such a big way. I was like, \"You make me want to have a family.\" I freaked him out a bit...Thank God I didn\u2019t spook him enough to make him leave.'\n\nIn an interview in 2014, Toy Story 4 star Christina said the couple had decided against having children.\n\nShe told Health magazine: 'We've decided that we are not really interested in having children. It seems like it's expected that you'd want to have kids.It's just very normal for people to say, \"Well, when you guys have kids...\"\n\n'And then when I say, \"Actually I don't think we're going to do that,\" people will say, \"Oh, you say that now...\" It doesn't bother me, though.'", "description": "Taking to Instagram, the Mad Men star and her husband both shared an identical post confirming they had gone their separate ways.", "authors": ["Lizzie Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/22/19858830-0-image-a-20_1571347725644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
