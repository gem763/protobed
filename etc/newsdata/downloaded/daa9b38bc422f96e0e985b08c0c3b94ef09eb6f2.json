This notion of inevitable \u201csenior moments\u201d couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. It\u2019s not natural for my brain or yours to slow with age.\n\nBrain Health Exercises\n\nHow long you live is not relevant to your brain health, but how you live is. A lifetime of exposure to toxins, stress, unhealthy diet, and other threats will damage your brain as it will the rest of your body. But, like the rest of your body, your brain can get healthier with exercise and healthy living habits. I\u2019d like to share with you my regimen for a fit, active, and healthy brain\u2014a combination of activities and supplements that will produce noticeable results, nearly immediately.You and I know the many ways that physical exercise benefits our bodies from head to toe. Exercise also strengthens your brain ! It reduces inflammation, which is the primary source for nearly all illnesses in our body. It stimulates the release of chemicals that help grow new blood vessels in the brain. Those chemicals also prevent old and new brain cells from dying. Exercise also improves your mood and sleep and reduces stress and anxiety\u2014problems in these areas are contributors to cognitive impairment. In addition to physical exercise, there are a variety of brain exercises that do not require you to sweat buckets. Some of my favorite brain-stimulating activities are \u201cthinking\u201d games\u2014crossword puzzles, sudoku, Scrabble, Words with Friends, chess, checkers, and more. Think of these activities as exercises in a gym. For some, an exercise routine isn\u2019t just a series of exercises, but a pattern of activities that help you stayed focused on meeting your fitness goals. You can also find all kinds of brain \u201cgyms\u201d online and for your mobile device\u2014many of them are free\u2014where you can develop a regimen that starts on your brain\u2019s fitness level and works up from there. Here are some of my favorite.\n\nLumosity\u2014Cognitive and scientific games designed to stimulate your brain and improve your memory and attention span. Dakin\u2014This self-described \u201cbrain fitness program\u201d has more than 100 brain exercises, games and puzzles. A free trial is avail on its website. Clevermind\u2014Clevermind is designed specifically for people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s. In addition to games, it features social, medical, and dietary tools. For $1.99 in the iOS App Store, it\u2019s a very affordable way to keep you in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s. (It\u2019s not currently available on Android.) Brain Trainer\u2014One of its key features is that you can customize your training specific to your personal brain health goals, such as memory, attention, problem solving, or agility. It\u2019s available for free in Google Play and iTunes.\n\nNatural Supplements for Better Brain Health\n\nI also recommend that you give your brain health regimen a boost with one or more of the following supplements, proven to improve your brain health.\u2014A tree that lives for 2,500 years has something special going on. And that\u2019s about how long it has been a staple of Chinese and Indian medicine to improve memory. Research confirms that ginkgo protects and improves mental processing speed and reduces symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. In a six-month study, 31 patients over 50 years old with mild to moderate memory impairment received either a ginkgo supplement or a placebo. Those who received ginkgo showed improved cognitive function, and their response speed on computerized tests was significantly better than in the placebo group. Another study concluded that ginkgo appears to support short-term memory. It can stabilize, and sometimes improve, cognitive performance of dementia patients. There\u2019s a library full of similar data. Give ginkgo a try after consulting with your doctor. Dosage varies depending on what you\u2019re treating.\n\nOlder people with high blood levels of EFAs scored better on mental function tests than people with low levels.\n\nscored better on mental function tests than people with low levels. Alzheimer\u2019s patients have lower than average brain concentrations of the EFA known as DHA, which makes up about 40 percent of your brain and is essential for building cell membranes.\n\nWhen Alzheimer\u2019s patients were given omega-3 supplements for 6 months, they had improved markers for brain-damaging inflammation and for the disease itself.\n\n\u2014Omega-3s are nutrients our bodies can\u2019t make on their own. We can get them only from food or supplements. They\u2019re not called \u201cessential\u201d for nothing, especially when we\u2019re talking about cognitive decline. Numerous studies have found that:Fish are a good source of omega-3s. But most waters are contaminated with pollutants, and therefore so are the fish. Even if you are able to find wild caught fish from uncontaminated waters, I still recommend limiting fish consumption to two to three servings per week. That\u2019s why I recommendin supplement form. It\u2019s easier to get a therapeutic dose, and it\u2019s safer to make them part of your daily routine. To ensure an adequate supply of omega-3s, I recommend EFAs from oil that\u2019s distilled to remove toxins and heavy metals, and contains my preferred ratio of DHA to EPA (2.5 to 1). Go with at least 1,250\u20131,500 milligrams of EPA and DHA per day, after consulting with your doctors.\n\nFresh Air for Your Brain\n\n\u2014The list of curcumin\u2019s many benefits seems to get longer every day. Add brain health to the list! Studies show that curcumin can prevent nasty proteins, called beta amyloids, from accumulating in the brain. Over time, these proteins amass into neuron-destroying plaque that\u2019s associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease . Curcumin then goes an extra step to remove plaque that\u2019s already there, which can reverse some of the terrible symptoms of cognitive decline that begin well before any clinical symptoms are evident. While these three supplements are tried and true, there are a score of other supplements beneficial to brain health . With all of these, talk with your doctor about which ones might work best for you, based on your specific health considerations.Finally, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t talk about the benefits of deep breathing on your brain. But for now, I want you to stop reading for 60 seconds. Instead, close your eyes and take at least 10 long, deep breaths. Feel better? You just injected your brain with fresh, oxygenated air. How you breathe will affect your mood\u2014excited, stressed, relaxed, tired\u2014and vice versa. By slowing down your breathing before or during stressful moments, you are helping protect your brain from the effects of stress and anxiety. Yoga is a great way to give your full body a workout and its meditative and breathing components recharge your brain.\n\nKeep Your Brain Booming\n\nReferences\n\nSpending a little time, every day, on improving your brain health couldn\u2019t be more critical. One new case of dementia is detected every 4 seconds. By 2050, more than 115 million people worldwide will have dementia. That\u2019s just a little less than the total population of Japan! But you can help protect yourself. Your age doesn\u2019t have to be an indicator of your brain health. You can slow down and protect yourself from Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia and cognitive decline\u2014 by giving your brain a daily workout, giving it more oxygen, and boosting it with a supplement.", "description": "As I enter my 60s, one of my biggest pet .09/02/2019 3:19:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png"}
