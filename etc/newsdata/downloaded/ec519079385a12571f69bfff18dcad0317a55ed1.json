It draws directly from what Biden views as a president who has \"abused the presidency to enrich himself \u2014 spending countless tax dollars at his own properties.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We must elect leaders with integrity, for whom the public interest is paramount. But that\u2019s not enough. We also must strengthen our laws to ensure that no future president can ever again use the office for personal gain,\" the plan reads.\n\nThe rollout of the policy plan comes as Trump and his reelection campaign continue to promote unfounded allegations of corruption about the former vice president and his son. A whistleblower complaint filed within the intelligence community accuses Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nThe complaint is now at the center of House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nBiden's new plan calls for introducing a constitutional amendment that to eliminate private dollars from federal elections, as well as polices that block the White House from improperly interfering in federal investigations.\n\nHe also wants a total ban on lobbying by foreign governments and would require every candidate for federal office to publicly disclose tax returns dating back 10 years. Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 election cycle, a move that broke longstanding precedent.\n\nHis plan also calls for a set of procedures to eliminate \"even the appearance that their financial holdings could influence decision-making.\"\n\nBiden has repeatedly condemned Trump in light of the allegations the president has floated about him and his son. Last week, Biden came out in support of impeachment, saying that Trump \"has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.\"", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday released a government ethics plan that directly targets President Trump and what the 2020 presidential candidate calls the \u201cmost corrupt administration in modern history.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_bidenjoe_101019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
