Maybe Barron doesn\u2019t like crowds. Maybe Trump knows people will be booing him and doesn\u2019t want to expose his kid to that. Maybe he\u2019s protecting him. Going after Trump because Barron wasn\u2019t there is gross. \u2014 Bridget Phetasy (@BridgetPhetasy) October 28, 2019\n\nPretty sure they\u2019re not all that concerned about looking gross.\n\nTrump knows he\u2019ll get booed in Washington DC (where he got 4% of the vote), why would he take Barron? They are finding ever dumber things to bag him about. #TDS https://t.co/Z18yNYxJvl \u2014 Rita Panahi (@RitaPanahi) October 28, 2019\n\nLeftists: LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AAAAHHHHHHRRAAAARRRRARARARARARRARAEEEEEEEK!!!11!1!!11!1!1!1!1!1!1!! Also Leftists: why didn\u2019t you bring your son Barron to a baseball game in the middle of the swamp? It would\u2019ve been a nice experience! \u2014 Alana Mastrangelo (@ARmastrangelo) October 28, 2019\n\nSeriously, look at this dumpster fire.\n\nA Father not taking his son to a baseball game, let alone a World Series game, is perhaps the worst indictment of a \u201cfamily man\u201d I\u2019ve ever heard. I have a feeling Trump could have gotten Barron a ticket, if he got tickets for Scalise and Gaetz. \u2014 Rob Anderson for Louisiana (@RobAnderson2018) October 28, 2019\n\nMan, the numbers are ticking on this one. I\u2019m guessing folks agree? I don\u2019t give a shit about politics, right now. My dad played \u201cA\u201d ball. My best memories as a kid were watching him play. My dad\u2019s a Republican (and a Red Sox fan). We can still talk baseball. \u2014 Rob Anderson for Louisiana (@RobAnderson2018) October 28, 2019\n\nHey guys, he doesn\u2019t give a s**t about politics right now, it\u2019s just in his name \u2026\n\nIf we rolled our eyes any further back in our heads we\u2019d be able to see Russia from our house.\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 hours since @realDonaldTrump tweeted anything. He must really be shook from getting booed at the game last night. I still can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t take Barron Trump to the game though. \u2014 Lady Clay (@ProfessorJester) October 28, 2019\n\nHaven\u2019t seen Barron for months\u2026who thinks he\u2019s been shipped off to some boarding school? Or is there something else going on? And, yes, a loving parent would typically bring his young son but the d always needs to have his \u201csecurity blanket\u201d around him. \u2014 Nancy Kokesh \ud83d\udc99 (@nkokesh) October 28, 2019\n\nImagine thinking it\u2019s somehow ok to talk about someone\u2019s kid like this.\n\nBarron and his parents attend the world series in box seats\u2026. Oops, that's suck up Gaetz not Barron. \u2014 Clara P. Jones (@Clarapjones0) October 28, 2019\n\nBarron is put on a lower step \u2013 Trump doesn't want his taller-more-handsome son to be seen next to his fat-orange-withering-ass. The handsome part came from the genes of the model-wife of course. #Barron #TrumpBooed #LockHimUp \u2014 Back to your Crib! (@TrumpBabyUS) October 28, 2019\n\nI can't picture Trump being able to pick Barron out of a lineup of two, with the other person being Betty White. \u2014 Anti-Deplorable (@DeplorableAnti) October 28, 2019\n\nJust freakin\u2019 clueless.\n\nTrumps kid Barron is always missing . Where\u2019s he hiding and why wouldn\u2019t he bring him to a World Series Game?? What\u2019s the reason Ole Donnie ?? \u2014 IRON WOMAN!! (@11c6558cc63241f) October 28, 2019\n\nThey think this is a good argument, like a super dunk on Trump.\n\nDon\u2019t make that face, we didn\u2019t write it.\n\nI have never seen a president's kid used as a weapon the way Barron Trump is. There is no depths these Democrats will not stoop to. \u2014 Carmine Sabia (@CarmineSabia) October 28, 2019\n\nTrue story.\n\nFolks, just leave Barron alone.\n\n-Follow Sam J. on Twitter @politibunny\u2013\n\nRelated:\n\nThey can\u2019t DEAL!
