There have been no findings of wrongdoing on the part of the former vice president or his son.\n\nThe phone call gained controversy after initial reports indicated a member of the US intelligence community had filed a whistle-blower report involving the president's interactions with a foreign leader. Democrats have also called for that complaint to be delivered to Congress, a move they say is included in their legal oversight responsibilities. The president and his administration have refused to release the complaint.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel wrote White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and threatened an \u201cescalated\u201d fight if documents aren\u2019t turned over by Thursday.\n\nA wave of Democrats meanwhile threw their support behind starting formal proceedings to remove the president from office, including Mr Biden himself, who said Congress should move to impeach Mr Trump if he failed to cooperate.\n\nJohn Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, has also endorsed impeachment proceedings in the House after withholding his opinion on the matter for several months.\n\nHe said in a speech on the House floor on Tuesday morning that \u201cwe cannot delay\u201d and now is the time to act.\n\nMr Lewis is one of the most influential Democrats in his caucus and an ally of Ms Pelosi, who has so far discouraged impeachment. He said he\u2019s been \u201cpatient while we have tried every other path\u201d and \u201cthe future of our democracy is at stake.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Reports indicated she was preparing to announce formal proceedings just before he released the statement announcing the forthcoming release of the transcripts.\n\nThe House Intelligence Chairman announced shortly after Mr Trump's tweets that the person behind the whistle-blower complaint has been in contact with the committee.\n\n\"We have been informed by the whistleblower\u2019s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so,\" he wrote in a tweet.\n\n\"We\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week,\" Mr Schiff added.\n\nMs Pelosi hinted she would still move forward with announcing her apparent public support for impeachment, saying at an event on Tuesday afternoon: \"We have to have the facts. That's why I've said as soon as we have the facts, we're ready. Now we have the facts, we're ready ... for later today.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "Donald Trump said he would release a \u201cfully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of his call with the president of Ukraine just hours before Nancy Pelosi was set to deliver a major statement on investigations into the president.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/14/AFP-1KK36V.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
