Charming \u2013 though, to be fair, she did later attempt to frame him for a murder she committed.\n\nIngleby, 43, has played the everyman in dozens of British dramas. He is prolific in the role, from starring as the father of an autistic child in The A Word, to his part as a downbeat copper in Inspector George Gently and the aforementioned stint as a corporate solicitor in Line of Duty.\n\n\u201cThe characters I tend to have empathy with are the ones that are everyman,\u201d says Ingleby. \u201cYou can identify with them because you know them, they're just people in the street rather than the James Bonds, the unreachable people you aspire to be, the glossies, the photoshopped. That's just me. And that\u2019s how I became a character actor. I\u2019m the friend rather than the lead.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The UK, France, Germany and Spain have three episodes each, all set in the very same police interrogation room, with the primary British cast led by Ingleby, Katherine Kelly and Rochenda Sandall and featuring guest appearances from David Tennant and Hayley Atwell.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Villanelle\u2019s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle\u2019s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-they/won\u2019t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.\" BBC/BBC America 27/34 Chernobyl \"Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.\" HBO 28/34 The Handmaid's Tale \"Season three's knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.\" Hulu 29/34 This Way Up \"The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.\" Channel 4 30/34 Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain \"A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.\" Channel 4 31/34 Succession \"Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all.

Are people going to be able to sit and be hooked?'\u201d And yet the result is an intelligent, gripping dive into what it feels like being inside those four walls, for both the suspects and the detectives.\n\n\u201cIt's just got all this lovely clever dialogue,\u201d says Ingleby, \u201cand there's no escaping from it, you can't mix it in with a chase sequence.\u201d\n\nThe show is already being compared to Line of Duty, not only for its concept but also for its cast overlap \u2013 both Ingleby and Sandall have starred in Jed Mercurio\u2019s BBC1 hit which is famous for its taut, 20-minute-plus interrogation scenes. Ingleby\u2019s character was even subjected to one.\n\nRecalling his time on the cast of Line of Duty, Ingleby says: \u201cI felt a bit of pressure, like, I don't want to be the one unbelievable character in this.\u201d He describes Mercurio, who was on set a lot, offering guidance to the cast about the intricacies of the labyrinthine plot, as a \u201cnice fella\u201d.\n\nMercurio has made headlines over the years for his Twitter tirades against journalists writing about his shows. \"Yet another unbalanced, inaccurate piece slagging off the research on Bodyguard,\u201d he wrote in response to an article in The Guardian. He also called a Spectator journalist a \u201cprick\u201d and a Sun corresponded a \u201cc***\u201d. The latter tweet has since been deleted.\n\nWhen I point this out to Ingleby, he looks vaguely amused. \u201cThe thing is,\u201d he says, \u201cif you're writing anything it becomes very precious to you. I can imagine for him it's a bit... you know. So for someone to come along and say, 'It's a bag of s***,' he's going to defend it. A lot of blood, sweat and tears goes into it and if somebody just pooh-poohs it\u2026\u201d he trails off, wincing.\n\nIngleby is no stranger to being on the receiving end of criticism, having had the \u201cpiss taken out of\u201d him at his state school in Lancashire, where he lived in an end-of-terrace house, the youngest of three children to a mother who worked as an auxiliary nurse and an engineer father. \u201cI was super spotty right up until my early twenties,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know what it's like as a teen, they're the most important years and you're trying to find your identity. It just crushes your confidence, anything like acne.\n\n\u201cAnd I started wearing specs at 14 and just had the piss taken out of me. It's ridiculous now when you look back on it, but at the time it's your entire world. I wasn't sporty either and I was from a place where football's huge. If you weren't into it, you were a bit of a loser.\u201d\n\nHe was into amateur dramatics as a youngster and says that when he discovered his love of acting it gave him a confidence boost, helping him to feel like he fitted in somewhere. \u201cBut I kept it to myself as well,\u201d he says. \u201cJust because I thought people might think I was a bit s***.\u201d\n\nIf the acting world was brutal then, it's not much better now. We\u2019re living in an era when beauty standards are impossibly high. A casting call for a Milka advert recently sparked outrage for seeking an \u201cangelic\u201d 11-year-old girl who \u201cmust not have reached puberty\u201d. The breakdown also stated: \u201cno red hair\u201d and \u201cno overweight children\u201d.\n\nOn whether a person\u2019s appearance can hold them back in an industry which has often been exposed to be supremely vain, Ingleby\u2019s response is frank. \u201cIt can, or it can propel you sometimes,\u201d he says, \u201cbut being a certain type of square-jawed, lovely hunk can get you a lot further.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen descriptions of different characters and been surprised by how many of them were like, \u2018She's pretty but she doesn't know it.\u2019 Sometimes it\u2019s not until it's pointed out that you see how shallow and superficial castings can be.\u201d\n\nIs pressure on appearances in the industry something that affects women more than men?\n\n\u201cProbably. Sometimes when it is pointed out you realise, oh god, yeah, the descriptions of the characters always tend to be the older man and the much younger woman. It doesn't matter what the guy looks like, but the women have to be, well, what they want is perfection, I suppose. It does happen the other way as well, it's a political hot potato.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt took going to drama school for Ingleby to gain real self-confidence. He trained at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art thanks to a grant from Lancashire County Council, after his drama teacher urged him to apply. \u201cI was lucky to get a grant when they still existed,\u201d says Ingleby, \u201cand then two years later the council didn't give out any. Without it, I couldn't have gone.\u201d\n\nOn whether the TV and film industry has a problem in terms of not casting enough regional, working class actors, Ingleby \u2013 who started out when the vivid, characterful work of Paul Abbott and the gritty realism and passion of Jimmy McGovern was popular \u2013 believes there is an issue of access as opposed to favouritism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a funny one,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause when that came up about posh people getting all the roles, I wasn't sure that was true outside of a specific genre. It was more to do with being able to go to drama school, to train. If you are from a modest income background, it's hard to go to these places \u2013 they have such high fees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that you've got to be posh in order to work, it's the accessibility.\u201d\n\nIngleby smiles conspiratorially, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the everyman characters he has played. \u201cIt\u2019s just about getting a foot in the door.\u201d\n\nCriminal is out now on Netflix", "description": "Lee Ingleby is perhaps best known for playing the only character in Line of Duty to acknowledge that his wife\u2019s arm was quite literally rotting off. \u201cThat thing on your wrist is starting to stink,\u201d he told Thandie Newton\u2019s Roz Huntley. Charming \u2013 though, to be fair, she did later attempt to frame him for a murder she committed.", "authors": ["Ellie Harrison"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/14/leigh-keily-lee-ingleby-0278.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
