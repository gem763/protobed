As well as putting less of a strain on your eyes, it\u2019s believed that dark mode will help conserve battery life.\n\nThe change was announced by the head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri on Twitter this week.\n\nIt\u2019s available to anyone using a phone or tablet running iOS 13 or Android 10. So some older devices won\u2019t have access to it if they haven\u2019t been updated.\n\nStarting today, you can use Instagram in dark mode on iOS 13 or Android 10. Turn dark mode on your phone to try it out. \ud83d\udc40 \u2014 Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) October 8, 2019\n\nHow to activate dark mode on Instagram\n\nCelebrating Instagram dark mode with a night mode shot pic.twitter.com/jm4mRRIRFq \u2014 Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) October 7, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, there isn\u2019t a simple toggle within the app to turn Dark Mode on and off.\n\nYou need to go to your general settings within iOS or Android and set it there. Instagram will then work with your phone\u2019s built-in Dark Mode to turn everything black\n\nThe end of the Following tab\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only change the app has made. It\u2019s also dropped the \u2018Following\u2019 tab \u2013 which has always been a favourite tool for Insta stalking.\n\nThe tab would let you see the activity of your Instagram friends \u2013 what they had liked and commented on. It was also useful for tracking celebs and seeing their activity on the app.\n\nBut since August, some users had been complaining the tab had disappeared, and now Instagram has made it official. It means that when you click the heart tab, you\u2019ll only see your own activity.\n\nAccording to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, it\u2019s making the change because only a small percentage of users use the Following tab on a regular basis.\n\nAlthough, not everyone was happy with Instagram removing it.\n\nI WANT THE FOLLOWING TAB BACK \u2014 Mia (@vividdolxn1) October 8, 2019\n\ndid instagram really take away its following activity tab, how the FUCK am I suppose to know shit now \u2014 Rachel (@rachhhhc3) October 8, 2019\n\nInstagram hasn\u2019t just been taking features away, though. It\u2019s also added a new \u2018Restrict\u2019 feature to try and stop bullying and harassment on the platform.\n\nIt enables you to swipe on a user, placing them on restrict. This means that you will no longer see their comments, unless you specifically tap on \u2018See Comment\u2019. Nobody else will be able to view the comment, except for the bully who posted it.\n\nInstagram has made some big changes this week (PA)\n\nYou won\u2019t receive any notifications from these restricted accounts, and any messages from the user will remain in Message Requests. Even if you choose to open the message, the user will not be able to tell whether you\u2019ve opened it, or when you were last active on the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Bullying is a complex issue, and we know that young people face a disproportionate amount of online bullying but are reluctant to report or block peers who bully them,\u2019 Instagram said in a statement.", "description": "No more Insta stalking", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_89108849_1570615797.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
