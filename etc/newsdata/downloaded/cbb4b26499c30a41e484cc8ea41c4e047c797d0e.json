I get why people are upset & I don't think it was @dev_101's time to go.\n\n\"But sending vile abusive tweets & death threats to @ShirleyBallas is totally out of order. Imagine if it was a member of your family on the receiving end,\" they said.\n\nDianne said she was very upset to hear what Shirley was being subjected to.\n\n\"Guys this is terrible you can not be bullying like this . It\u2019s awful and really upsets me to hear this . It's simply not ok and should never happen!\" Dianne told her 143,000 followers.\n\n(Image: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nEarlier in the week, Shirley appeared on Loose Women where she claimed Strictly viewers were to blame for not saving Dev and Dianne.\n\nThe judges had given the couple a high score for their cha cha but the impact of the viewer vote sent the duo crashing into the bottom two by the end of the night.\n\nShirley said: \"People have got to get out there and vote. We do our job. As you can see there were many people saved with lot lower scores.\n\n\"It's just so important. I respect everybody at home who\u2019s been watching fifteen series. Everyone has a favourite. We do our job to the best we can.\n\n\"We have to do it right there in that split second on the one minute 20 seconds. We have to make a decision.\n\n\"The three judges were unanimous. It wasn\u2019t down to me. It was unanimous and I agreed.\"\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\nDianne had looked heartbroken when she and partner Dev discovered their fate on Sunday.\n\nSpeaking on spin off It Takes Two the following night, Dianne said she'd promised Dev he was 'going to be fine' because of the praise given to them earlier in the night.\n\nBoth Craig Revel Horwood and head judge Shirley Ballas also expressed their shock at seeing Dev in the dance off.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nDianne said: \"They gave us great comments. They said the dancing was great. It was just that they wanted him to be a little bit more cheeky in that cha cha.\n\n\"I feel like Dev went out there and did exactly what they said.\"\n\nDev added that he also felt like he'd given the second performance his all.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBut sadly it wasn't enough for the judges who unanimously voted to save Viscountess Weymouth and Aljaz Skorjanec.\n\nDianne was so upset by the decision she couldn't complete the obligatory final dance and pulled out of appearing on the show's podcast with her boyfriend Joe Sugg after filming wrapped.\n\nBut the red-head said she hopes it's not over for Dev and she'll continue teaching him if he wants to continue to learn to dance.\n\n\"I'm just really, really sad it's over,\" Dianne told Rylan Clark-Neal.\n\nRadio 1 DJ Dev also said that he was shocked by the judges' final say as he had given it is all in the dance-off.\n\n\"I feel like I really, really went for it and tried to give it everything ... I guess it wasn't enough.\"", "description": "Strictly fans have been directing their anger at the head judge after Dev Griffin was voted out of the show", "authors": ["Lucy Needham", "Image", "Bbc Guy Levy", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Jeff Spicer Getty Images", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13903280.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Joe-Sugg-and-girlfriend-Dianne-Buswell.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
