Something like Mayweather vs Tenshin in Japan.\n\n'We spoke a bit about doing a special fight in China, but halfway through he turned to the Pacquiao rematch so we stopped.'\n\nMayweather beat Pacquiao on points in their first bout back in 2015, but it was an underwhelming fight for the fans who had waited so long.\n\nTherefore, there has been some clamour for them to repeat the event and give the fans a more exciting fight between the two boxing legends.", "description": "Mayweather, who technically retired in 2017 following his bout with Conor McGregor, laced up his gloves to make \u00a37m in an exhibition with Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/11/19581864-0-image-a-66_1570788293465.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
