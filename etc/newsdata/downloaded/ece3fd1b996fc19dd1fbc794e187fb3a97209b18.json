That means he could walk out of prison after one year, two months and five days, reported Mlive.com.\n\nHe also must pay restitution of $7,000 to the victim's family.\n\nWhite's mother, Teresa Simpson, was not impressed with the outcome of the case, labeling Anger's sentence 'a great injustice.'\n\n'Where is the fairness here?' Simpson said of the 39-month prison term. 'This is a slap in my face. This is a slap in my son\u2019s face.'\n\nShe then addressed Anger directly, telling him: 'You took my son. You took a father from his kids.
