And they will not be well served by current levels of contributions and they really need to step up,\u201d Mr Dinham said.\n\nMr Dinham supported the push to raise super contributions to 12 per cent while recognising the challenges facing employers who will have to foot the bill. The superannuation guarantee is stuck at 9.5 per cent and is due to rise to 10 per cent in 2021 before increasing to 12 per cent by mid-2025.\n\nThe super guarantee is expected to be the focus of an inquiry established by the government which some suspect will be used to call for a pause in mandated level of savings. The Assistant Minister for Super, Jane Hume, has reportedly described 10 per cent as a nice round number.\n\nMr Dinham said there was a mountain of evidence from actuaries saying mandated levels of savings at 9.5 per cent won\u2019t deliver adequate retirement income for retirees. He says this is compounded by the fact that Australians have one of the longest life expectancies in the world.", "description": "Dithering over the lift in the mandated level of super contributions is putting a generation of retirees at risk.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_177/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d6ef2d38641b3d3b803bfacf76ed0f237ee7ec8f", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
