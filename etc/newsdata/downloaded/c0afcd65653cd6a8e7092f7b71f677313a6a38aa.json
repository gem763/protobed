Photo: Courtesy of the vendors\n\nIn our advice column, Ask the Strategist, we take your most burning shopping questions and survey friends, call up experts, and draw on our own personal experience to answer them. As always, please comment with any questions of your own \u2014 we\u2019re here to help.\n\nQuestion: I need a short, cool puffer jacket that won\u2019t cost me more than $180, basically goes with everything, and I\u2019ll be able to wear for years. This Frank and Oak coat is calling my name, but it\u2019s too expensive. And I need it to be short because I\u2019m five-foot-four and I drown in most winter coats.\n\nYou\u2019ve come to the right place! I, too, am looking for a short puffer jacket, and would not like to spend more than $180. In fact, I\u2019d like to not spend more than $150, so there are some even cheaper options on this list (with a few splurges at the end, which, if you\u2019re looking for something to hang on to for a while, might be worth investing in). And I\u2019m with you when it comes to length \u2014 save the North Face down jackets that fall to your ankle and could double as a sleeping bag for an Alaskan cruise, or at least just for subzero temperatures. Below, all the worthy short, cool puffers I\u2019ve found on my search, many of which will (hopefully) work for you, too.\n\nUniqlo Women Ultra Light Down Cocoon Jacket It\u2019s not quite as bright a yellow as the Frank and Oak coat you like, but this one from Uniqlo is a pleasing burnt-marigold shade that you probably won\u2019t get sick of after a couple seasons. I actually tried this on over the weekend and found it warm without being too heavy, with a length that hits at a flattering place on the upper hip. And the price is right: You could buy it in two colors (it also comes in green, beige, pink, and blue) and still be under your budget. $80 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nUniqlo x J.W. Anderson PJ Reversible Down Jacket Here\u2019s another one that I was eyeing at Uniqlo. I know what you\u2019re thinking: This coat is from a buzzy collab, meaning it is not necessarily timeless and you\u2019ll probably end up sharing a subway car with at least one other person who\u2019s wearing it. I counter that with, It\u2019s really nice-looking! And reversible, so you\u2019re getting two colors in one coat. Plus, the hood is removable. One of my good friends just bought the blue/green, and I have her blessing to buy one, too. If I can risk matching with someone I see all the time, I think you can risk it, too. $150 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Which We Want Felicia Puffer Jacket Just look at that collar! Your neck is going to be so warm. The \u201cbone\u201d color and silver drawstring toggle feel very \u201990s ski lodge, and the drop shoulders give the coat an interesting, slightly rounded silhouette. $128 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Everlane The ReNew Puffy Puff $80 (was $160, now 50% off) The cut and attached hood on this one remind me of the Frank and Oak coat, and since this is part of Everlane\u2019s Choose What You Pay sale, it could be yours for a cool $80. Olive green is a classic winter-coat color, and it has a little extra length (while still being short) to keep you warm. $80 at Everlane Buy\n\nOrolay Women's Short Hooded Coat with Removable Belt Remember the Amazon Coat? This puffer comes from the same brand, and looks extremely cozy. A belt might seem superfluous on a puffer, but I like the utilitarian vibe it gives this coat (and if you don\u2019t like the belt, you can always remove it). $80 at Amazon Buy $80 at Amazon Buy\n\nPhoto: Retailer Which We Want Anita Corduroy Puffer This corduroy puffer is probably less practical for the elements, but it\u2019s very soft-looking and, should you pair it with some corduroy pants of a different wale, would be a subtle way to wear a corduroy suit this fall. $128 at Need Supply Co. Buy\n\nJuicy Couture Cozy Zip Puffer Jacket This Day-Glo-orange puffer comes courtesy of Juicy, and is also available in a more sedate olive-green shade. Aside from the color, it\u2019s actually pretty standard-looking, so you could get away with wearing it for years. But don\u2019t worry, the zipper still says Juicy Couture, so the coat still has some \u2026 personality. $80 at Nordstrom Rack Buy\n\nadidas by Stella McCartney Padded Pull On Jacket Another bright option, in a half-zip. $150 at Shopbop Buy\n\nLucky Brand Short Puffer Jacket At $60, this is one of the least-expensive puffers we found, and also comes in several colors, including a cheery yellow that looks a lot like that Frank and Oak. (It does say \u201cLucky Brand\u201d on the hood, so just note that before you add it to your cart.) $60 at Nordstrom Rack Buy\n\nAlo Introspective Quilted Jacket This one has a flattering crop and bell sleeves, which are not something you typically see on a puffer. It\u2019s also shorter than some of the other coats on this list, making it a better option if you\u2019re on the petite side. $121 at Nordstrom Rack Buy\n\nPuffers over $200\n\nAritzia The Super Puff\u2122 I regret to inform you that the coat on this list that most closely resembles your Frank and Oak favorite is only $50 less than the one you like, and $70 over your budget. But, hey, every penny counts, and if you\u2019re looking for something you\u2019re going to have for years to come, maybe it\u2019s worth the splurge. $250 at Aritzia Buy\n\nGanni Whitman Quilted Shell Down Jacket Okay, it\u2019s a little over the budget (though only by $37!), but this Ganni number is surprisingly elegant for a puffer and comes in two neutral shades, neither of which you\u2019ll get sick of in a season or two. $217 at The Outnet Buy\n\nThe North Face 1996 Retro Nuptse Puffer Jacket Is it over your budget? Yes. Will it be suitably warm and still look good after multiple seasons of wear? Yes. $249 at Urban Outfitters Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
