Here's What's on Sale Right Now", "language": "en", "text": "Walmart built its reputation on low prices \u2014 and it lives up to the hype every year with the rollout of the latest Black Friday deals. Last year at Walmart, Black Friday deals were strong in several categories, with big sales and major discounts on technology, media, toys, entertainment, kitchen appliances, and all manner of gifts.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t yet have details on what the best Walmart Black Friday deals will be in 2019, it\u2019s safe to say shoppers can expect to see similar discounts across a wide range of merchandise. And if you\u2019re looking for pre-Black Friday deals at Walmart, you\u2019re in luck \u2014 because the company has tons of online deals going live a full month before Black Friday. (When is Black Friday? It\u2019s always the day after Thanksgiving. So it\u2019s Friday, November 29, in 2019.)\n\nWalmart always gets into the holiday shopping game early: Last year, the Walmart Black Friday ad made its debut on November 8, and although the absolute best deals didn\u2019t drop until the day before Thanksgiving, it offered some pre-Black Friday deals (starting as early as November 1) that were almost as good as the real thing, like a Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet for $50 off and a 16-inch convertible HP laptop for $170 off the list price.\n\nCourtesy of Walmart More\n\nThe \u201cBlack Friday\u201d deals at Walmart start even earlier this year. Walmart just launched what the company is calling an \u201cEarly Deals Drop\u201d on Friday, October 25, with online pre-Black Friday sales on TVs, home goods, toys, and a wide range of other gifts.\n\nHere are some the Early Deals Drop items on sale at Walmart.com now, as of Friday, October 25:\n\nCourtesy of Walmart More", "description": "Huge discounts on TVs, home goods, toys, and more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c.8Yhyfr0rgwJ9BXqdMzeg--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/5da5e26feec3a4a15800fd42b9fad47e", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
