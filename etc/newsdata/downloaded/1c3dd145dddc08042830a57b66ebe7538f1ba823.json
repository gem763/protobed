Li said that the video was intended to show the current state of deepfake technology, which is developing more rapidly than he expected. He told the MIT Technology Review at that time that \"perfect and virtually undetectable\" deepfakes were \"a few years\" away.\n\nWhen CNBC asked for clarification on his timeline in an email after his interview this week, Li said that recent developments, including the emergence of the wildly popular Chinese app Zao, had led him to \"recalibrate\" his timeline.\n\nRead more: Viral Chinese deepfake app Zao lets people superimpose their faces onto celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and it is terrifyingly convincing\n\n\"In some ways, we already know how to do it,\" he said in an email to CNBC. \"[It's] only a matter of training with more data and implementing it.\"\n\nThe advancements in artificial intelligence are enabling deepfakes to become more believable, and it's now more difficult to decipher real videos from doctored ones. This has raised alarm bells about spreading misinformation, especially as we head into the 2020 presidential election.", "description": "Deepfake artist Hao Li said that soon we will get to the point where there is no way to actually detect deepfakes.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8764c92e22af0119409b92-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
