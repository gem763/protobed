A decision must be made in the coming days as the clock ticks down on PDVSA\u2019s $913 million payment due Oct. 28.\n\nDeliberations in the Trump administration have picked up as advisers to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, recognized by the U.S. and nearly 60 nations as the country\u2019s rightful leader, signal they lack the money to make the debt payments and the largest reported holder of the notes -- London-based Ashmore Group Plc -- insists on its right to the collateral.\n\nThe Treasury Department declined to comment, as did PDVSA, Citgo, Ashmore and Guaido\u2019s office.\n\nLooming PDVSA Default Pits Ashmore Against Venezuela\u2019s Guaido\n\nWhile some U.S. officials are leery of interfering in the bond market or property rights, the White House also worries that it would be a political disaster for Guaido to lose Citgo, the Houston-based refining unit of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, the people said. President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s regime could blame that on Guaido, Trump and Wall Street, they said.\n\nAs a result, officials in Washington are acknowledging the increasing likelihood that the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control revokes General License 5, effectively putting transactions related to the PDVSA 2020 bonds on the same footing as other Venezuelan financial deals that are prohibited. There\u2019s still some opposition to such a move, the people said, and talks continue. The U.S. has refrained from formally promising this to Guaido\u2019s representatives because that may dissuade them from negotiating with creditors, the people said.\n\n\u201cIf OFAC revokes GL5 and makes changes to the related FAQ guidance, the enforcement on the collateral securing the 2020 bonds will be unauthorized,\u201d said Cecely Hugh, investment counsel in emerging-market debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London. \u201cThis means that the collateral would be effectively worthless while the sanctions are in place.\u201d\n\nThe bonds have fallen to about 33 cents on the dollar as skepticism grew about the payment, from about 90 cents just a few months back.\n\nThe debt payment is complicated by Venezuela\u2019s precarious political situation after countries began recognizing Guaido as president in January, citing irregularities surrounding Maduro\u2019s re-election in 2018. With the U.S.\u2019s support, Guaido and his allies effectively run Citgo, yet have little operational control over PDVSA and barriers to government finances.\n\nGuaido\u2019s team made a $71 million interest payment on the 2020 bonds in May, which it called a \u201cpayment under protest.\u201d On Oct. 15, the opposition-led National Assembly approved an accord calling the notes unconstitutional because they weren\u2019t approved by the legislature. Creditors argue the prior payment legitimized the debt.\n\n--With assistance from Sydney Maki and Fabiola Zerpa.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ben Bartenstein in New York at bbartenstei3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Carolina Wilson at cwilson166@bloomberg.net, Brendan Walsh, Dave Liedtka\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is preparing to take action Friday with a measure to protect Venezuela\u2019s most prized asset abroad from creditors before a key debt payment, according to people familiar with the matter.U.S. officials are discussing a last-ditch move that would prevent holders of", "authors": ["Ben Bartenstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mW.CEnaIvMfY.3R.Tm_hKw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/56e0727fed904a04d05d5f39cfc5c75a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
