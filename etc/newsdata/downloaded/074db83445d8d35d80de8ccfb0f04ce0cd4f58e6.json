Here is a solution, which could be called the \u201cChinese Tariff Dividend\u201d: A 30 percent tariff would annually collect $150 billion on $500 billion of Chinese imports, generating $600 per U.S. adult ($1,200 per married couple) annually. Congress should legalize the distribution of the \u201cChinese Tariff Dividend\u201d to all adult U.S. residents. This payment would be very simple to administer as a credit on tax returns.\n\nThe distribution would amply address concerns about possible price increases and concomitant weakening of U.S. consumption. Furthermore, it would serve to quiet the tariff naysayers who all too easily ignore the paramount end goals of the tariff policy: eliminating Chinese intellectual-property theft, stopping forced technology transfer for market access, and reducing the huge trade deficit with China. These same naysayers also miss the obvious \u2014 namely, that the tariff revenue at present is a windfall to the U.S. Treasury, which would create the \u201cChinese Tariff Dividend\u201d opportunity in the first place. To put it another way, the debate always seems to be \u201cWho pays the tariff?\u201d But it could just as easily be \u201cWho gets it?\u201d\n\nBoth countries\u2019 economic participants share the burden of a given tariff, but given the significant bilateral trade asymmetry (four U.S. imports to one Chinese import), coupled with very legitimate U.S. trade grievances, the situation is tailor-made for a U.S. initiated trade war, in which the United States stands to benefit greatly. The proposed \u201cChinese Tariff Dividend\u201d is a fitting remedy which would more than compensate the consumer for any higher prices paid, and thus, be a big political win to boot.\n\nPAUL MATTEN\n\nNaples, Fla.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
