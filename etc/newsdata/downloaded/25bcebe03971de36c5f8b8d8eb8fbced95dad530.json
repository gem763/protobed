Meanwhile, from Paris, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted the worst global economy growth since the financial crisis.\n\nAs a long-term investor, you\u2019re taught to ignore the daily grind, keeping those eyes on the prize! Backing that up, our call of the day from Bernstein Research says that 10 years from now, you\u2019ll still be better off in equities.\n\nBernstein strategists Inigo Fraser-Jenkins and Alla Harmsworth argued the respective cases for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.00% to reach 4,000 and 8,000 over that time frame. Where they agree is on this bottom line: even if the index is not going to keep rising at the pace it has over the last 40 years, equities are still the best asset class to beat inflation.\n\nAs for their separate arguments, Fraser-Jenkins says there are plenty of reasons that the S&P can\u2019t go higher than 4,000. Chiefly, he points to evidence that equities are expensive using the Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (a popular stock-valuation measure). Also, low yields and baby boomers pouring money into stocks have helped keep the S&P moving up, and household equity allocation is at an all-time high, he says.\n\nIn the S&P-is-going-to-8,000 corner, Harmsworth argues that the Shiller P/E has wrongly forecast low returns for most of the last decade.\n\nEven if households don\u2019t keep buying stocks, there's plenty of proof companies will keep buying back their own shares, with some $820 billion in buybacks announced this year alone, said Harmsworth. Microsoft and Target each just dropped news on this front (see below).\n\nRead: The S&P is in an earnings recession and it\u2019s about to get worse\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.19% , S&P SPX, +0.00% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.07% are higher at the start of trade.

And if the Fed is lowering rates, as now, don\u2019t be short. Doesn\u2019t always hold true, but often enough to ignore.
