The energy secretary\u2019s meeting adds to a growing picture of Giuliani working with Cabinet officials to push Ukraine to launch investigations.\n\nThe former Texas governor became publicly linked to the Trump-Ukraine scandal earlier this month after sources familiar with the situation told Axios that Perry arranged Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky and that the president said so in a recent conference call with House Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe only reason I made the call was because Rick asked me to,\u201d Trump reportedly said, according to Axios. \u201cSomething about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant.\u201d\n\nMykola Lazarenko/Presidential Press Service Pool Photo via ASSOCIATED PRESS Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, left, and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry at their May 20 meeting in Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\nIn the call with Zelensky, which is at the center of the House impeachment inquiry, Trump asked the Ukrainian president to interfere in the 2020 election by investigating political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump also alleged that Ukraine has Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, asking Zelensky to look into cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, which was hired to investigate the hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016.\n\nPerry\u2019s phone call with Giuliani reportedly came after a White House meeting in May after Zelensky\u2019s inauguration, according to the Journal. Officials at the meeting, including Perry and then-U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, encouraged Trump to meet the new president, but Trump said that they needed to work with Giuliani to resolve the lawyer\u2019s concerns about Ukraine. Perry reportedly understood those concerns to be related to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nGiuliani has been specifically pushing the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine and not Russia that interfered in the 2016 election. Former special counsel Robert Mueller and the U.S. intelligence community investigated and found that Russia had interfered in the election to help Trump win.\n\nPerry told the Journal that some of the conspiracy theories that Giuliani related in their call included that Ukraine was responsible for a dossier on Trump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia, that Ukraine had Clinton\u2019s email server and that the country\u2019s government made up false evidence to send former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to jail.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether that was crap or what,\u201d Perry told the newspaper. \u201cI\u2019m just saying there were three things that he said. That\u2019s the reason the president doesn\u2019t trust these [Ukrainian] guys.\u201d\n\nThe three House committees in charge of leading the impeachment inquiry subpoenaed Perry last week, demanding that the energy secretary turn over documents related to the Trump administration\u2019s communications with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cRecently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the President\u2019s stark message to the Ukrainian President,\u201d the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees wrote Oct. 10.\n\nThe letter also said the reports bring up questions \u201cabout your efforts to press Ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a Ukrainian state-owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s push to get Ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election.\u201d\n\nPerry has to respond to House subpoenas by Friday. The energy secretary also has denied reports that he is expected to resign by the end of the year.", "description": "The energy secretary said Trump's lawyer offered debunked conspiracy theories on Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election, The Wall Street Journal reports.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da7d38d2000000010505eaf.jpeg?cache=qkcjuqrrjm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
