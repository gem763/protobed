He doesn\u2019t know, and at this stage we don\u2019t know, but we\u2019ll make a decision.\u201d\n\nElectric wing May is also expected to be named in the starting line-up on Thursday morning despite struggling throughout the week with a hamstring injury. The Leicester Tigers back is England\u2019s joint top try-scorer at the World Cup, having scored against Argentina as well as his double last weekend, and although he was contained to a sprinting session on Wednesday, his worth to Jones\u2019s plans means he will be given until the last minute to prove his fitness.\n\nShould May fail to recover in time, Joe Cokanasiga is expected to be handed a shock recall, with doubts remaining over Jack Nowell\u2019s ability to start the semi-final given his extensive injury issues over the last five months.\n\nTom Curry and Sam Underhill will be retained in the back row with Billy Vunipola, meaning that George Kruis will be brought back into the starting XV to strengthen England\u2019s lineout after they were picked apart at the set-piece in last November\u2019s 16-15 defeat by the All Blacks at Twickenham. Their two remaining injury concerns in Nowell and scrum-half Willi Heinz both trained fully on Wednesday and should be named in the matchday 23, with Jonathan Joseph expected to drop out.", "description": "Eddie Jones will rip up his England\u00a0midfield once again to restore George Ford at fly-half and reunite him with Owen Farrell to face New Zealand\u00a0on Saturday, and will give Jonny May every chance to prove his fitness for the Rugby World Cup semi-final.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/22/Farrell-and-Ford.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
