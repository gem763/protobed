He plans to sing it as a duet with Kelly Clarkson.\n\nWhile Legend has not revealed all of the new lyrics, he teased some in a recent interview with Vanity Fair and others emerged in Entertainment Weekly.\n\nWhat was originally 'I've got to go away, but baby it's cold outside' in Frank Loesser's 1944 version of the song is replaced with 'I've got to go away, I can call you a ride' in Legend's. He teamed up with Insecure star Natasha Rothwell to pen the new lyrics.\n\nIt is not the first time the song's lyrics have sparked controversy.\n\nAnd while many embraced Legend's 'woke', #MeToo-era version of it, others called it 'pathetic'.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nJohn Legend and Kelly Clarkson (pictured in May 2018) will team up for his new Christmas album to sing the re-imagined version of the song\n\nORIGINAL LYRICS (in part) I really can't stay (but baby, it's cold outside) I've got to go away (but baby, it's cold outside) This evening has been (been hoping that you'd drop in) So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice) My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?) My father will be pacing the floor (listen to the fireplace roar) So really I'd better scurry (beautiful please don't hurry) But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour) The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there) Say what's in this drink? (no cabs to be had out there)\n\nJOHN LEGEND'S NEW LYRICS I really can\u2019t stay (baby it's cold outside) I've got to go away (I can call you a ride This evening has been (so glad that you dropped in) So very nice (time spent with you is paradise My mother will start to worry (I'll call a car and tell 'em to hurry) What will be friends think (I think they should rejoice) If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice) Legend has not yet released the full song. It will be on his Christmas album, out November 8.\n\nAmong critics was Gayle King who sighed on CBS This Morning after hearing the new lyrics and said: 'It makes me nash my teeth to powder.\n\n'You have to look at the intent of the song. They're flirting, it's fun.\n\n'Good on John Legend and Kelly Clarkson, but cranky yankies - its OK, it's a fun song!'\n\nThe original song lyrics have been criticized in recent years as seemingly diminishing the idea of female consent to sex.\n\nThe line 'say what's in this drink?' has been particularly controversial and, some have claimed, is a reference to date-rape.\n\nSome have also argued that the tug of war it portrays, with the female singer protesting that she must leave while her male counterpart tries to convince her to spend the night, is a reference to a woman's ongoing struggle against society and being expected to be well-behaved.\n\nEsther Williams and Ricardo Montalban singing the song in Neptune's Daughter in 1949. It was originally written in 1944 and has been sung by a number of famous musicians\n\nGayle King sighed on Tuesday and said that while she liked John Legend and Kelly Clarkson, the original song was 'fun' and had nothing wrong with it\n\nThe song was written in 1944 by Frank Loesser, an iconic American songwriter who penned the music for Guys and Dolls among other Broadway shows.\n\nIt has long been claimed that he wrote the song to sing with his wife for a housewarming party to indicate to guests that it was time for everyone else to leave.\n\nOver the last 70 years, it has been recorded by artists including Dean Martin, Doris Day and Bing Crosby, James Taylor and Natalie Cole, Michael Buble with Anne Murray and then Idina Menzel, Christina Aguilera with Cee-Loo Green.\n\nLegend himself has not yet commented on the new lyrics, nor has Clarkson who recorded the song with the original lyrics for her 2013 Christmas album with Ronnie Dunn.\n\nIn recent years, Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen have gained a reputation as outspoken Democrats who sympathize with liberal causes.\n\nTheir ongoing criticism of Trump attracted the president's attention and in a Twitter tirade last month, he lashed out at them.\n\nNegative response: Some called it 'pathetic' that they had rewritten the classic holiday song\n\nHe called Legend 'boring' and Teigen 'filthy mouthed', complaining that they did not give him any credit for signing into-law a criminal justice reform which he was propelled towards by Kim Kardashian West.\n\nLegend, in his recent Vanity Fair interview, called the president a 'terrible human being' and said he believes he only signed in the reform to win credibility with stars.\n\n'It\u2019s a cheap win for [Trump]. But the people being granted clemency are real people with families.\n\n'So even if the clemency is won through his celebrity-whore tendencies, it\u2019s still helpful for that family and that person.\n\nAt the same time, he\u2019s locking kids in cages and he\u2019s a terrible human being,' he said.", "description": "What was originally 'I've got to go away, but baby it's cold outside' in Frank Loesser's 1944 version of the song is replaced with 'I've got to go away, I can call you a ride' in Legend's.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/17/20338212-0-image-a-60_1572369568201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
