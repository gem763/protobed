REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31 come what may, despite parliament passing a law ordering him to secure a new transition deal to soften the economic blow.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, September\u2019s IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell by more than any economist predicted in a Reuters poll, tumbling to a six-month low of 49.5, below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction.\n\nCombined with even weaker manufacturing and construction surveys earlier in the week, September\u2019s all-sector PMI sank to 48.8 from 49.7, its lowest since the month after the referendum decision to leave the EU in June 2016, and before that 2009.\n\nIHS Markit said the figures suggested Britain\u2019s economy shrank by 0.1% in the three months to September.\n\n\u201cComing on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, (this) would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession,\u201d IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.\n\nBritain\u2019s economy shrank by 0.2% in the three months to June - the first decline since 2012 - and a second quarterly contraction would meet the recession definition used in Europe.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson sent new Brexit proposals to the EU and said that unless the bloc compromised, Britain would leave without a deal at the end of this month.\n\nLeaving the EU without a deal risks causing major disruption to trade, at least in the short term, due to the immediate imposition of new tariffs and regulatory checks at ports.\n\nBritain\u2019s economy is also slowing due to the trade conflict between the United States and China.\n\n\u201cINSIDIOUS WEAKENING\u201d\n\nThe PMI data are not a fail-safe guide to the outlook for the economy. Immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016, they pointed to a sharper downturn than was actually the case.\n\nBut longer-term trends in the all-sector PMI generally match up well with official quarterly growth numbers.\n\n\u201cSeptember\u2019s decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nFirms which took part in Thursday\u2019s survey - which does not cover retailers - reported that foreign customers were switching business away from Britain due to fears of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nNew export orders fell at the sharpest rate since March, when Britain was originally due to leave the EU.\n\nSolid consumer demand has so far cushioned Britain\u2019s economy from some of the impact of Brexit uncertainty, helped by the lowest unemployment rate since 1975 and wages that are rising at the fastest pace in a decade.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBut the latest survey added to signs from consumer sentiment surveys that jobs could be becoming less secure.\n\nServices businesses shed staff at the fastest rate in nine years in September. Taken as a whole, this week\u2019s PMIs pointed to the sharpest fall in employment since December 2009.\n\nFirms said they mostly reduced staff by not replacing leavers, rather than through lay-offs.", "description": "Britain's economy appears to have tipped into recession as firms brace for the risk of a disruptive Brexit in just a few weeks' time, according to a survey which showed the dominant services sector took an unexpectedly sharp downturn last month.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436578319&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920LV"}
