The notion that Hunter Biden and his father could be complicit in Ukrainian corruption was first aired in a 2018 book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, by conservative author Peter Schweizer. The book and its author had a purpose and a lineage.\n\nSchweizer, an editor at Breitbart News, is the president of the Government Accountability Institute (GAI), a nonprofit group whose board chairwoman and major donor is Rebekah Mercer, a prominent Trump supporter and benefactor of right-wing causes\u2026\n\nBy this past spring, it was clear the Biden attack was stuck in the conservative ecosystem. And here\u2019s where Trump enters the story\u2014and inadvertently kicks off the whole impeachment saga: Trump may be the single most devoted consumer of conservative media, absorbing hours of it each day. He was mainlining the Biden coverage as part of his daily media diet.", "description": "", "authors": ["Joshua Green", "Bloomberg.Com News Articles Trump-S-Impeachment-Saga-Stems-From-A-Political-Hit-Job-Gone-Bad"], "top_image": ""}
