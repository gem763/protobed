Reilly (@ryanjreilly) August 11, 2015\n\nWhy are there men with guns and the police are doing nothing?!!!! \u2014 Kayla Reed (@iKaylaReed) August 11, 2015\n\nPhoto via @Lumumbandele Oath Keepers here with loaded guns walking directly in front of the police\u2026 https://t.co/UHMDU2fszA \u2014 Tef Poe the \ud83d\udc10 (@TefPoe) August 11, 2015\n\n\u201cMedia launches new demonization campaign as Oath Keepers arrive in Ferguson,\u201d read an Infowars.com headline Tuesday; the story noted that Oath Keepers members were with two reporters for the site.\n\nAD\n\nIf the presence of this group was confusing, here\u2019s a brief explainer on their background and history in Ferguson.\n\nWho are the Oath Keepers?\n\nOn their Web site, the Oath Keepers are described as a group focused on fulfilling \u201cthe oath all military and police take to \u2018defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'\u201d The site notes that the organization is composed of members who have, or have previously had, some sort of connection to law enforcement or the military.\n\nAD\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, however, describes the Oath Keepers as a \u201cfiercely antigovernment, militaristic group.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe core idea of the group is that its members vow to forever support the oaths they took on joining law enforcement or the military to defend the Constitution,\u201d reads the SPLC site. \u201cBut just as central is the group\u2019s list of 10 \u2018Orders We Will Not Obey,\u2019 a compendium of much-feared but entirely imaginary threats from the government \u2014 orders, for instance, to force Americans into concentration camps, confiscate their guns, or cooperate with foreign troops in the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne Oath Keeper named Sam Andrews told the New York Times last year that the group\u2019s membership includes \u201ca really broad group of citizens, and I\u2019m sure their motivations are all different. In many of them, there\u2019s probably a sense of patriotism. But I think in most of them, there\u2019s probably something that they probably don\u2019t even recognize: that we have a moral obligation to protect the weakest among us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Terrence McCoy wrote in November:\n\nThe Oath Keepers are many things to many people. For one fervent believer , it\u2019s about the Constitution. For another , it\u2019s about a .50-caliber Bushmaster and his right to carry it. Others talk of fear: fear America has become a security state. Fear President Obama has become a dictator. Fear the Oath Keepers are needed now more than ever \u2014 especially in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nThe group, McCoy added, \u201ccame into being after founder Stewart Rhodes wrote a 2008 manifesto calling for men and women to protect a complacent America besieged by what he described as dictatorial leaders. \u2018If a police state comes to America, it will ultimately be in your hands,\u2019 Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, wrote. \u2018That is a harsh reality, but you had better come to terms with it now, and resolve to not let it happen on your watch.'\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhat are the Oath Keepers doing in Ferguson?\n\nOath Keepers are here carrying big guns. Everyone, mostly media, loses it. pic.twitter.com/8FSdnlVEkh \u2014 Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) August 11, 2015\n\nAbby Phillip, who is on the the ground for The Washington Post in Ferguson, described the scene like this:\n\nMembers of the group arrived on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson in the early morning as protests wound down just before 2 a.m. The small group of men \u2014 dressed in military-style camouflage and bullet-proof vests, and armed with long guns \u2014 initially startled protesters, some of whom asked the Oath Keepers to leave. But they insisted that they were \u201con their side,\u201d and had arrived to protect protesters from police, who stood standing watching in riot gear across the street. They said Missouri law permitted them to openly carry legally owned weapons. When the Oath Keepers crossed to the same side of the street where police stood, protesters followed. But police didn\u2019t react to their presence.\n\nHere are a few pictures:\n\nAD\n\nOath Keepers have shown up in Ferguson with assault rifles.

Another six set restrictions but don\u2019t prohibit it. In every other state, including Missouri, it is legal to carry a loaded long gun in public without a permit, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nHas this group been in Ferguson before?\n\nYes, in November \u2014 though their presence was rather confusing for residents and activists then, too.\n\nHere\u2019s the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, describing the scene a few days after it was announced that Darren Wilson \u2014 the officer who shot Brown \u2014 wouldn\u2019t face criminal charges:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing a night of arson fires and bashed storefronts that hit close to home, Greg Hildebrand stood naked Tuesday, drying off from a needed shower, when he noticed somebody on the rooftop. \u201cI opened the window and said, \u2018Hey, can I help you?\u2019\u201d said Hildebrand, 35, a website developer. The man said he was security and would be up there at night with others to protect the pocket of second-story apartments and lower-level storefronts near the Ferguson Police Department. A day earlier, rioters had broken out windows below Hildebrand\u2019s apartment in the 100 block of South Florissant Road and torched a nearby beauty supply store. \u201cI am in the middle of a difficult spot,\u201d Hildebrand said. \u201cI feel a lot better having those guys up on the roof.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re here, there\u2019s definitely a weight lifted off of our shoulders,\u201d Davis Vo, whose family owns a local restaurant, told the New York Times, when discussing the Oath Keepers in November. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said otherwise.\u201d\n\nWhat do authorities in Missouri say?\n\n\u201cTheir presence was both unnecessary and inflammatory,\u201d St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.\n\nIn an email to The Post, Brian Schellman, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said the agency would \u201cconsult\u201d with the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office \u201cabout the legalities of the issue.\u201d\n\nA email to a St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office spokesman was not immediately returned.\n\nWhat do the Oath Keepers say?\n\nAn e-mail to Oath Keepers was not immediately returned Tuesday.\n\nBut here, from the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube, are videos of Oath Keepers engaging with some of the Ferguson protesters:\n\n[This post has been updated.]\n\nAD", "description": "The group said it was there for protection.
