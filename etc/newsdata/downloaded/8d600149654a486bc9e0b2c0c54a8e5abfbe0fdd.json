It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions,\u201d wrote European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Twitter.\n\nEarlier in the day, the leader of the key Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party, Arlene Foster, said she could not back the current proposal.\n\nThe party did not immediately publicly sign on to the newly announced deal, but Johnson said that the plan was ready to go. It could still fall apart in Parliament, as a previous deal did under Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nAD\n\nDiplomats said that if a deal is reached Thursday, it could still be possible \u2014 just barely \u2014 to get it ratified by the European Parliament by the end of the month, giving Johnson a strong incentive to wrestle his warring political tribes into submission.\n\nAD\n\nOne senior E.U. official said that Johnson told the Europeans that he could get a deal ratified in Britain in six days. Still, leaders are poised to convene again in Brussels before the end of the month, amid a growing sense that nothing can be finalized during the two-day summit that was getting underway.\n\nAccording to people briefed on the talks, Johnson was willing to make a slew of concessions in the interest of fulfilling his promise to get Britain out of the European Union this month \u2014 and perhaps at any cost.\n\nAD\n\nNot only does he have to strike a bargain that can get the approval of 27 other E.U. countries \u2014 itself a difficult task \u2014 but he then must sell it at home. British domestic politics can be unforgiving. May made a deal with Brussels only to have it defeated three times in Parliament.\n\nAD\n\nBefore the two-day summit begins, representatives from each of the E.U.\u2019s 27 remaining member states will want to digest any deal and make recommendations to their leaders. In Europe\u2019s consultations, where not all leaders speak English, even translations sometimes need to be given time.\n\nThe key sticking point in the closed-door talks in Brussels has been what happens to the border between Northern Ireland, which will leave with the rest of the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland, which will remain a member of the E.U.\n\nAD\n\nRight now, the boundary is mostly invisible. Both sides want to keep it that way, to preserve the peace of the Good Friday Agreement \u2014 but they have differed over how to achieve it, with Britain going in one economic direction and the E.U. going in another.\n\nUnder the current deal, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with most E.U. rules so that the border could stay open. Eventually, Northern Ireland lawmakers could vote to move closer toward the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nAD\n\nIt bears a strong resemblance to an arrangement the E.U. floated more than a year ago \u2014 and that May said would never work for London because it would require customs checks in the Irish Sea for goods traveling inside the United Kingdom.\n\nAD\n\nBut now, Johnson appears willing to cross red lines if it means he can fulfill his promise to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31. That would mean convincing his partners in Britain.\n\n\n\nFoster of the DUP, who has become a key person in the bargaining, has said she wants more of a role for her party in determining the future of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe remaining 27 E.U. countries, meanwhile, want to make sure that differences in the tax systems between the E.U. and Northern Ireland don\u2019t encourage smuggling or other behavior that takes advantage of the situation.\n\nBooth reported from London.
