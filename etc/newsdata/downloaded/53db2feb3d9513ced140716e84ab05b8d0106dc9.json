Hundreds of users have been arrested.\n\nJong Woo Son is facing multiple federal child porn charges for running a massive trove of child sexual exploitation that investigators have called the \u201cworld\u2019s largest dark web child porn marketplace,\u201d a nine-count indictment unsealed on Wednesday has revealed. The charges include advertising and distributing child porn as well as money laundering.\n\nUS federal investigators were able to trace the site to Son\u2019s home thanks to a computer glitch that revealed his IP address. Servers that were home to some 200,000 different videos, uploaded by members of the site in exchange for \u201cpoints\u201d allowing them to view more of the depraved content, were kept in his own bedroom.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bipartisan bill aims to tackle rampant child porn sharing on Pentagon computers\n\nBrowsers hunting for legal porn were warned away with a red-lettered notice on the site\u2019s front page: \u201cDo not upload adult porn.\u201d The site\u2019s location on the dark web meant accidental viewers were unlikely, as it could only be accessed with the exact address. Users paid for the abhorrent clips in points they bought with Bitcoin, which \u2013 despite its reputation for anonymity \u2013 helped investigators track them down.\n\n\u201cYou may try to hide behind technology, but we will find you and arrest you and prosecute you,\u201d US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu said during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe scale of this crime is eye-popping and sickening,\u201d John Fort, chief of IRS criminal investigations, told reporters, crediting \u201cour agency\u2019s ability to analyze the blockchain and de-anonymize Bitcoin transactions\u201d with the \u201cidentification of hundreds of predators around the world.\u201d\n\nAmong the hundreds of suspects arrested since the site\u2019s seizure in March 2018 were several former US government employees. Richard Gratkowski, a former Homeland Security Investigations agent, was sentenced to 70 months in prison in May, after using his own government passport as identification to open an account with Bitcoin wallet company Coinbase, which he used to pay for his sick entertainment.\n\nUS Army veteran Stephen Langlois received 42 months in prison that same month for downloading 114 videos. Another unidentified former federal law enforcement agent had the equivalent of 50 hours of child porn footage downloaded from the site.\n\nAlso on rt.com Police with child porn priors \u2018lost\u2019 evidence in German pedophilia case, victim\u2019s lawyer tells RT\n\nSouth Korean authorities have arrested over 300 suspects in addition to Son, noting that most were unmarried office workers in their 20s, though some had sex crimes on their record. UK authorities have also nabbed some of the site\u2019s users, including one man sentenced to 22 years in prison in March for repeatedly abusing two young children and uploading the footage to Welcome to Video.\n\nInvestigators from the Center for Missing and Exploited Children examining the footage were shocked to find that nearly half of it had not previously been encountered and depicted children unknown to authorities.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
