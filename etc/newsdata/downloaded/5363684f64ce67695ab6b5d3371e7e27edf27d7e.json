The business said the move would cut the operation's annual carbon footprint by more than 1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\nIn July, AngloAmerican signed a deal with Enel Generacion Chile for the supply of 3 TWh a year for a 10-year period.\n\nAccording to Enel the deal will enable AngloAmerican to cut its total carbon dioxide emissions in Chile by more than 70%.", "description": "The firm is attempting to green its operations.", "authors": ["Anmar Frangoul"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106192906-1571659618719gettyimages-976188470.jpeg?v=1571659685", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
