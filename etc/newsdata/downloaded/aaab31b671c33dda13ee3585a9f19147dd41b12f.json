Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family [is] safe,\" he explained last week.\n\n\u201cWe can all do better and while no one is perfect, we all have a responsibility for our own individual impact,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question is what we do to balance it out.\u201d\n\nPIERS MORGAN SLAMS PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE FOR HYPOCRISY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY WON'T LET HER FATHER MEET BABY ARCHIE: REPORT\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan came under fire this summer when they took a private jet to go on vacation to Ibiza, then to Nice, France, despite the flight's carbon impact on the planet.\n\nThey reportedly flew from Farnborough, U.K., to Ibiza, Spain, on Aug. 6, then back on Aug. 12.\n\nOn Aug. 14, they flew from Farnborough to Nice, France, to visit pal Elton John, then back to Farnborough on Aug. 17.\n\nKATE MIDDLETON, PRINCE WILLIAM FLY COMMERCIAL FOLLOWING MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY PRIVATE JET BROUHAHA\n\nThe couple is believed to have taken a Gulfstream 200, which seats 19 people, to Ibiza from Farnborough, and a Cessna 500 XL, which seats nine, on their return trip.\n\nTheir trip to Nice was to spend time at Elton John's home.\n\nELTON JOHN DEFENDS PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE PRIVATE JET USE\n\nJohn later said in a statement that he provided the flight for the Sussexes to preserve their safety and privacy.\n\n\u201cI am deeply distressed by today\u2019s distorted and malicious account in the press surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s private stay at my home in Nice last week,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cPrince Harry\u2019s Mother, Diana Princess Of Wales, was one of my dearest friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana\u2019s untimely death.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY SECRETLY FLEW TO IBIZA WITH PRINCE HARRY ON PRIVATE JET\n\n\"After a hectic year continuing their hard work and dedication to charity, David and I wanted the young family to have a private holiday inside the safety and tranquility of our home,\" he continued. \"To maintain a high level of much-needed protection, we provided them with a private jet flight. To support Prince Harry\u2019s commitment to the environment, we ensured their flight was carbon neutral, by making the appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint\u2122. I highly respect and applaud both Harry and Meghan\u2019s commitment to charity and I\u2019m calling on the press to cease these relentless and untrue assassinations on their character that are spuriously crafted on an almost daily basis.\"\n\nPRINCE HARRY, KATY PERRY AMONG STARS ATTENDING GOOGLE CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT VIA PRIVATE JET\n\nThe trip to France reportedly had a carbon footprint of 3 tons, while the annual carbon footprint for the average British citizen is 13 tons. The Ibiza trip reportedly emitted six times more carbon dioxide than a commercial flight from London to the Spanish island.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER SLAMS HER, PRINCE HARRY'S PRIVATE FLIGHTS AS 'HYPOCRITICAL'\n\nPrince Harry gave a speech barefoot earlier this month at Google's secret celebrity summit, saying he and Duchess Meghan would have, at maximum, two children (including infant son Archie) to prevent environmental harm from climate change \u2014 which also rubbed royal watchers the wrong way, with some accusing the couple of shading Kate Middleton and Prince William, who welcomed their third child, Prince Louis, last year.\n\n\u201cWhen royal eco-lecturers preach one thing in public and then do the opposite in private, they shouldn\u2019t be surprised if they are dismissed as eco-hypocrites,\u201d a source who's worked with the royals told Page Six. Duncan Larcombe, former royal editor of The Sun, snapped, \u201cI was stunned by Harry\u2019s stupid comments about only having two kids when his brother has three. And this wasn\u2019t a throwaway line \u2014 this was in a copy-approved interview. It\u2019s madness.\u201d\n\nGAYLE KING DEFENDS MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY'S PRIVATE JET USE\n\n\u201cTheir message should be, \u2018Look how fortunate we are to embody the hopes and aspirations of the nation,\u2019 \u201d Campbell complained. \u201cInstead, they are acting like the emperor and empress of America, saying they are far too grand to travel commercial.\u201d\n\nDuchess Meghan hopped on a commercial flight across the pond to support her close friend Serena Williams at the U.S. Open this weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, royal critics have simultaneously slammed Duchess Meghan for allegedly trying to maximize her own publicity, as well as for keeping their son Archie shielded in privacy.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE UNFAZED BY PRIVATE JET FIASCO\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S BEST FRIEND CALLS OUT 'RACIST BULLIES' CRITICIZING HER PRIVATE JET USE\n\n\u201c[Meghan and Harry] won\u2019t allow Archie to be photographed when they land [in South Africa], and the press are starting to gripe,\u201d Larcombe told Page Six. \u201cIf there was pressure before on the upcoming tour, it\u2019s intensified now. There\u2019s so much riding on it.\u201d\n\nThe couple's hiring of publicity firm Sunshine Sachs also drew ire, though the firm was hired to promote Prince Harry's sustainable travel initiative \u2014 and he paid the company's fees out of his own pocket, not from taxpayer funds.\n\nA spokesman for Sunshine Sachs told Page Six that they aren't personally advising the royals, and denied that the Duchess said she wants to \u201cbreak the internet.\u201d\n\nROYAL EXPERT: PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE'S 'DETRIMENTAL BEHAVIOR' MAY BOTHER PRINCE WILLIAM\n\n\u201cWe briefly worked on the Vogue project in the U.S. market and were retained in the past few weeks for the launch of Travalyst in the U.S. market,\u201d Chris Bastardi told Page Six.\n\nStill that didn't help all their critics. Campbell griped, \u201cWhy do you need a defamation expert on a charity\u2019s board? The whole thing is farcical and impertinent. Their crisis management is best handled by someone who understands the royal system, and not by Americans.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about service, not about telling people how wonderful you are,\u201d she said. \u201cI have yet to speak to a member of the British working class or middle class who is in favor of Meghan\u2019s conduct.\u201d", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are under fire from insiders who allege that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are a PR nightmare for the royal family.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/meghan-markle-prince-harry-mandela-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
