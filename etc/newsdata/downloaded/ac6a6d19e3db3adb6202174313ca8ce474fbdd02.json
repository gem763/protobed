Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d The letter was written on the day Turkey\u2019s military operation started. Turkish officials told the BBC and other news outlets Thursday that Erdogan threw the letter in the trash.\n\n\u201cBut the most clear answer to the letter that was written on October 9 was the Peace Spring Operation,\u201d CNN Turk reported, citing diplomatic sources and using Turkey\u2019s code name for its offensive.\n\nAD\n\nErdogan has rebuffed appeals for a cease-fire and chided Western allies for suggesting he negotiate with \u201cterrorists,\u201d as he refers to the Syrian Kurdish militias because of their links with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has fought an insurgency in Turkey for decades.\n\nErdogan said Wednesday that Turkey would \u201cnever declare a cease-fire\u201d and vowed to forge ahead with plans to enforce a buffer zone as deep as 20 miles into Syrian territory. The swath of territory would stretch more than 280 miles from the northern city of Manbij to the Syrian border with Iraq.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey\u2019s offensive, which includes its own bands of Syrian rebels, has upended alliances and reignited tensions in a particularly volatile corner of Syria, where U.S. troops for years partnered with Kurdish-led fighters to battle the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has faced criticism, including from his own Republican allies, amid reports of a rushed U.S. troop withdrawal.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. military withdrew from Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the Islamic State, as well as Tabqa and a major headquarters at the Lafarge Cement Factory in Jalabiya, Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a U.S. military spokesman, said in a tweet.\n\nAt the cement factory, after American troops had left, U.S. forces used F-15 jets to carry out airstrikes on parts of the headquarters to \u201cdestroy an ammunition cache and reduce the facility\u2019s military usefulness,\u201d Caggins wrote.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to the ammunition, the strikes targeted a small compound that was ringed with blast walls and included living quarters and diesel power generators, said a U.S. military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the operation.\n\nLamothe reported from Washington.\n\nAD", "description": "The visit came a day after the White House made public a letter Trump sent to Erdogan urging the Turkish leader to\u00a0\u201cmake a great deal.\u201d", "authors": ["Kareem Fahim", "Istanbul Bureau Chief Covering The Middle East", "Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region", "Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dxM-lbsrR078VG_tnmK_-qID_5g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZ7FG4HQZQI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
