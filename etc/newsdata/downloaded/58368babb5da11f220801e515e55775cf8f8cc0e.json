The strain was made public two weeks ago when Bridenstine posted a statement on Twitter prior to Musk\u2019s recent update on his Starship spacecraft. The administrator suggested Musk should prioritise its NASA contract to send astronauts to the International Space Station on SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon.\n\nMusk responded to the tweet during a CNN interview, saying, \u201cDid he say commercial crew or SLS?\u201d, jokingly referencing NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket, the development of which has been delayed for years.\n\nBridenstine responded to the quip during an interview with the Atlantic. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s helpful,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cSLS, that\u2019s a whole different mission. SLS is going to the moon. So I don\u2019t know why you would compare the two.\u201d\n\nStanding together on Thursday for an update on their joint commercial crew program, Musk and Bridenstine seemed interested in deescalating the row, exchanging compliments and emphasising their shared goal.\n\nPerhaps as an olive branch or as a way to show that he\u2019s the good guy, Musk reminded Bridenstine that NASA can share SpaceX\u2019s IP with anyone.\n\nAs Tech Crunch points out, Musk brought the matter up twice. \u201cI\u2019ve been very very clear with Jim that any SpaceX data should not be considered proprietary,\u201d Musk said during a Q and A. \u201cIt can be used by any of our competitors... No charge.\u201d\n\nMusk reiterated the point later: \u201cI want to be clear: NASA can share all of our IP with anyone that NASA wants.\u201d\n\nBridenstine responded by thanking Musk, but clarifying that there are reasons that NASA has to be cautious about who it shares information with. \u201cThere is IP that it is in the interest of the nation that we cannot be sharing with people, or with countries that would not have our interest at heart,\u201d Bridenstine said, according to TechCrunch.\n\nWhile Musk seems to be presenting himself as a visionary who wants his innovations to proliferate so humans can explore the universe, NASA had to remind him that the government is more concerned with others on Earth who want to use that technology for goals that conflict with American interests.", "description": "During an event with NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine on Thursday, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk publicly stated that the agency can share SpaceX\u2019s intellectual property with whomever it wants\u2014not that NASA seems especially eager to....", "authors": ["Alex Cranz", "John Herrman"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/cs3bw7ce5jy6u5dq9rug.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
