Zagorsky is a senior lecturer at Questrom School of Business at Boston University.\n\nHe writes that Americans are expected to spend $86 on every person who plans to celebrate Halloween, which amounts to $8.8 billion total \u2014 including half a billion on their pets.\n\nZagorsky says this may be an example of conspicuous consumption \u2014 spending more money on items than they're worth \u2014 \"to show others you are rich, smart, or important.\"\n\nIn this case, people may be trying to attract the attention of that conspicuous consumption through Instagram photos of their pets.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nHalloween spending is out of control.\n\nAmericans are expected to spend $8.8 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations this year \u2014 or $86 for every person who plans to celebrate. That includes a half a billion dollars on costumes that Americans are buying for their pets, which is double the amount they spent a decade ago. Pumpkins and hot dogs are the favorites.\n\nHow did a holiday that began as a way to honor the dead morph into just another ritual of over-the-top American consumption? As a relatively frugal person who has reused the same Halloween costumes for years, I found the $86 figure shocking. But I'm hardly the first economist to moan about out-of-control consumerism.\n\nDay of the decadent\n\nHalloween started as a Celtic holiday honoring the dead.\n\nIt was then adopted by the Catholic Church as a time to remember saints. One research paper described Halloween as an \"evolving American consumption ritual,\" but a better description might be an over-the-top spending ritual.\n\nTo put the $8.8 billion being spent on Halloween into context, the budget for the entire National Park Service is only $4 billion. The US spends less than $2 billion on flu vaccines.\n\nThe $86 average may not give us an accurate look at per-person spending. Only about two-thirds of respondents to the National Retail Federation's annual survey of Halloween spending said they were celebrating the holiday. And while some spend nothing, others go overboard.\n\nAs just one example, the Palo Alto neighborhood where Silicon Valley's tech stars live is a sight to behold as local moguls try to outdo each other on Halloween decorations, candy, and bands.\n\n\u201cHairy Pawter, Furmoine Granger and Dognald Woofsley are our trick-or-treating for Halloween. I reckon Fabbe, Pippi & Nisse are almost cuter than the original trio but I might be biased lol.

It laid out the idea that some goods and services are bought simply for conspicuous consumption.\n\nConspicuous consumption is designed to show others you are rich, smart, or important. In Veblen's mind, conspicuous consumption was spending more money on items than they are really worth. Veblen pointed out that people buy homes with rooms that are rarely used, just to show off the owner's wealth.\n\nIf Veblen were writing about the world today, he would probably not focus on real estate. Instead, he might be using examples of people trying to attract attention on Instagram by dressing their pets in expensive costumes.\n\nUnderstanding how much people spend on holidays like Halloween and other activities is important because this shows what society values. And apparently, we value what others can see us consume.\n\n[Like what you've read? Want more?
