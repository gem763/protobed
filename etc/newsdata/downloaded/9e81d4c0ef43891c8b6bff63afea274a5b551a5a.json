The company found itself in the middle of Canada\u2019s biggest political crisis in years after the country\u2019s ethics watchdog found Trudeau pushed for the company avoid a criminal trial over its dealings in Libya.\n\nWhen asked whether a so-called deferred-prosecution agreement is more likely with the Trudeau Liberals back in power, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said on BNN Bloomberg TV Tuesday: \u201cThat\u2019s a continuing discussion that the justice minister will have to have.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has always said his interest in SNC\u2019s fate was based on his desire to avoid job losses.\n\nPrior to this week, the stock had slumped more than 60 per cent this year after the company issued three profit warnings, wrote down the value of its Middle East energy business and lost a contract in Chile valued at US$260 million.\n\nNot everyone is optimistic about SNC prospects. \u201cWe see no reason to be long SNC-Lavalin until better visibility is offered,\u201d Frederic Bastien, analyst at Raymond James said in a report published before the election results came in. The status of its court proceedings, the challenged fixed-price projects it has yet to substantially complete, and the earnings trajectory of its low-risk engineering and nuclear services businesses are all reasons to stay cautious, he added.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Company found itself inside of political storm earlier this year", "authors": ["Divya Balji", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/snc-lavalin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
