It allowed football coach Nick Saban to do likewise, going from $4 million in 2007 \u2014 when he signed with Alabama after leaving the Miami Dolphins \u2014 to $8.7 million this season.\n\nEven obscure associates like Iowa State basketball coach Steve Prohm and Cincinnati football coach Luke Fickell ($2 million each) have enjoyed a hefty boost in earning power.\n\nSo imagine the guild\u2019s chagrin at Bennett breaking ranks instead of breaking the bank. Having led Virginia to its first national hoops title last season, he was positioned to move the needle and show solidarity with his peers. All that remained was following the time-honored script for a coach in his position.\n\nHe executed the opening act perfectly, securing a contract extension that the school announced Monday. But he flubbed his lines when Virginia offered the perfunctory financial adjustment.\n\nBennett declined to accept a pay raise.\n\nHis fellow coaches probably likened that to blasphemy.\n\n\u201c[My wife] Lauren and I are in a great spot, and in the past I\u2019ve had increases in my contract,\u201d Bennett said in a news release. \u201cWe just feel a great peace about where we\u2019re at, all that\u2019s taken place, and how we feel about this athletic department and this community and this school. I love being at UVA.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I have more than enough, and if there are ways that this can help out the athletic department, the other programs and coaches, by not tying up so much [in men\u2019s basketball], that\u2019s my desire.\u201d\n\nAccording to the USA Today Sports\u2019 coaching database, Bennett made $4.15 million last season, including a $1 million longevity payment. The Daily Progress reports that his annual base salary was $500,000 in 2017, with the remainder of compensation paid for by sponsors and donors.\n\nBennett clearly isn\u2019t hurting financially.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make the act any less noteworthy. Instead of accepting an extra $500,000, he asked the school to give raises to his staff and make improvements to the program.\n\n\u201cThis just does not happen in our industry,\u201d athletic director Carla Williams said in the release. She could extend that to most industries and most individuals.\n\nTurning down pay raises is antithetical to American ideas of business and capitalism. It typically doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a cook earning $15 per hour or a CEO earning $100 million per year. More is better than less, and more is better than the same.\n\nIt\u2019s in our nation\u2019s DNA.\n\nBennett is the rare exception in this instance. And he didn\u2019t simply refuse a half-million-dollar salary bump. He also pledged to donate that amount, out of his own pocket, to a career-development program launched for former and current UVA men\u2019s basketball players.\n\n\u201cTony\u2019s decision \u2013 to turn down a well-deserved raise and instead invest in his players and UVA athletics more broadly \u2013 tells you everything you need to know about him as a leader and as a human being,\u201d school president Jim Ryan said in the release. \u201cTony is one of the most selfless people I\u2019ve ever met, and this is just the latest example.\u201d\n\nHe previously displayed uncommon grace and humanity in the face of unprecedented failure, when the top-seeded Cavaliers lost to No. 16-seed UMBC in the 2018 NCAA tournament. He was rewarded the following season, as UVA survived several close calls en route to beating Texas Tech in overtime for the title.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m a little biased,\u201d he said in the release. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s one of the greatest sports stories ever told.\u201d\n\nNo argument here. Experiencing a wider emotional gulf from one season to the next is virtually impossible. Now he has put a cherry on top for the school and its fans.\n\nSome fellow coaches might feel a bit pressured to emulate Bennet\u2019s gesture, but don\u2019t count on it. Either way, the grand scheme of big-money college sports will remain, a lopsided landscape in which everyone gets a paycheck except the players. (And, no, a handful being compensated for their likeness isn\u2019t the solution).\n\nBennett\u2019s choice is great for UVA and inconsequential for other members of the coaching fraternity.\n\nNonetheless, there\u2019ll be no surprise if he soon receives a stern talking to.\n\n\u2981 Brooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
