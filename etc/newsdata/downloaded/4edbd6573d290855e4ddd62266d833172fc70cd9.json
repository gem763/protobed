Frank Becerra Jr. , fbecerra@lohud.com\n\nCulinary Institute of America senior Derrick Bradley is likely to pause for a moment each time he walks down a hallway that is newly named in honor of the late chef Anthony Bourdain, who graduated from the Hyde Park, New York, school in 1978.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a subtle reminder of his legacy and who he was,\u201d Bradley said of Bourdain, who died in 2018. \"I\u2019m going to remember what he did.\u201d\n\nBourdain, Bradley said, made a career of stepping outside of his comfort zone, exploring and embracing adventure \u2013 all with a culinary flair. And a lot of this can be traced back to the time that the host of CNN's \"Parts Unknown\" spent as a student at the CIA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it even more interesting,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nBourdain's legacy took center stage at the CIA on Friday as a main hallway in Roth Hall was named in his honor and more than 100 students cheered following the dedication. A conversation that focused on Bourdain followed in the school's Marriott Pavilion.\n\n\"Les Halles D'Anthony Bourdain\" greets visitors as they enter the main campus building that is home to classrooms, restaurants, dining hall and administrative offices.\n\nCIA President Tim Ryan during his address at the private dedication ceremony referenced Brasserie Les Halles, the New York City restaurant where Bourdain achieved wide recognition. Ryan also referenced the old Les Halles in France, the fresh food market in Paris.\n\n\"It's a really rare occasion when the CIA honors someone by naming a major facility after them,\" Ryan said. \"When we do, it's for people who have had a groundbreaking impact on our industry, on our college and, especially, our students. \u2026 Tony Bourdain certainly falls into that category.\"\n\nBourdain attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, for two years before deciding to become a chef. In addition to the fame he achieved on CNN, he wrote several books, including \"Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,\" and he hosted numerous TV shows.\n\nBourdain gave the commencement address at the CIA on Dec. 19, 2017. He also received an honorary doctorate from the school at that time. Bourdain took his own life on June 8, 2018, while working on \"Parts Unknown\" in France. He was 61.\n\nBut his legacy continues to grow. And the manner in which Bourdain's impact is expanding at the CIA was underscored Friday by the presence at the dedication ceremony of celebrity chefs Eric Ripert and Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s.\n\nThe two chefs were Bourdain's friends and in the wake of his death worked with the CIA to launch the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship. The scholarship assists students in pursuing studies abroad.\n\nThe scholarship has been funded by gifts from various sources. In addition, Bourdain's estate is donating 40% of the proceeds from an online auction of his belongings and mementos to fund the scholarship.\n\n\"Tony touched the heart of so many people,\" Ripert said. \"Not only in our field, not only in America, but worldwide. He inspired us.\"\n\nJohn W.
