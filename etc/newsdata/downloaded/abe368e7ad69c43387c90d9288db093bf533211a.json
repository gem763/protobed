The French purveyor of luxury goods had been the most sought-after brand at the airport since 2011.\n\nKT&G's sales grew 56 percent to W103.1 billion last year from W66.2 billion in 2014. Having already reached W71.8 billion in the first half of this year, sales are expected to increase by almost W50 billion this year (US$1=W1,124).\n\nA staffer at the airport attributed the growth in KT&G's sales to a hike in tobacco prices early last year, which almost doubled prices and appears to have prompted some outbound smokers to stock up at duty-free stores.", "description": "Cigarettes Become Top Sellers at Incheon Airport's Duty-Free Shops", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2016-08-01"}
