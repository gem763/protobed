They\u2019re all the end products of videos shared by the uber-popular YouTube channel \u201c5-Minute Crafts.\u201d\n\nKnown for its \u201clife hacks\u201d and \u201ccrazy home science tricks,\u201d 5-Minute Crafts advertises itself as a place where people can go to learn how to \u201cexperience the joy of doing it yourself.\u201d But while some of its videos demonstrate life skills that could be considered truly useful, the ones that have gone viral seem to fall more on the bizarre end of the spectrum.\n\nA good example of this phenomenon is the three-day blue egg video mentioned above. After Twitter user @chipspopandabar shared the clip \u2014 which calls for viewers to to leave an egg in white vinegar for a day before soaking it in maple syrup and blue dye to make a bigger and bluer egg \u2014 on Thursday, it quickly racked up over 2.4 million views and nearly 45 thousand likes. But many were left wondering what exactly the purpose of this \u201ccraft\u201d was.\n\n\u201cSo what is this giant rubbery blue egg used for?\u201d questioned one Twitter user in response.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

There are many things to put eggs in, some of which make it bigger than before, which fascinates me,\u201d joked another.\n\nHowever, despite the cryptic inspiration behind its videos, 5-Minute Crafts is clearly onto something. With nearly 59 million subscribers, the page is the third most popular on YouTube. It ranks only behind the pages of controversial Swedish gamer Pewdiepie (98 million subscribers) and T-Series (106 million subscribers), a record label and film production company in India.\n\n5-Minute Crafts has been a part of the YouTube community since November 2016 and is owned by TheSoul Publishing, a Cypriot company founded by Russian developers Pavel Radaev and Marat Mukhametov that also owns popular content farm channels like BRIGHT SIDE. \u201cWe are the company behind some of the web\u2019s most well-known brands and most shareable content!\u201d TheSoul\u2019s website reads. \u201cFrom life-hacks to science, beauty to crafts, we offer something for everyone.\u201d\n\nAccording to video intelligence company Tubular Labs, in June 2019 alone, 5-Minute Craft\u2019s videos received over 550 million views on YouTube and nearly 1.8 billion on Facebook. That\u2019s a whole lot people who love crafting.\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "description": "Here's the story behind the uber-popular YouTube channel \"5-Minute Crafts\" specializing in \"life hacks\" and \"crazy home science tricks.\"", "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/three-day-blue-egg.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
