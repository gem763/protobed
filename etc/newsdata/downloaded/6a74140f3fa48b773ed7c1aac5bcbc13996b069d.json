(AP) - The Latest on Michigan\u2019s ban on flavored electronic cigarettes (all times local):\n\n5:21 p.m.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says she will appeal a judge\u2019s decision to block enforcement of the state\u2019s new ban on flavored electronic cigarettes.\n\nThe Democrat issued a statement Tuesday calling the ruling \u201cwrong\u201d and saying it \u201csets a dangerous precedent\u201d of a court second-guessing the expert judgment of public health officials.\n\nWhitmer last month ordered the issuance of emergency rules after her chief medical executive found that youth vaping is a public health emergency.\n\nCourt of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens ruled Tuesday that vaping shops that sued are likely to prevail on their contention that the rules are procedurally invalid.\n\nWhitmer wants the Michigan Supreme Court to issue a \u201cquick and final\u201d ruling on the dispute.\n\n___\n\n2:40 p.m.\n\nA Michigan judge is blocking the state\u2019s two-week-old ban on flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nCourt of Claims Judge Cynthia Stephens issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday. She says Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s administration\u2019s delay in implementing the ban undercut its position that emergency rules were needed.\n\nStephens also says there is evidence that if flavored vaping products are prohibited, adults will return to using more harmful combustible tobacco products.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by vaping businesses that say they will go out of business due to the ban.\n\nWhitmer has said the ban is necessary to combat an epidemic of teens vaping.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Michigan's ban on flavored electronic cigarettes (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
