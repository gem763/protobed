Giuliani Whistleblower Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney\n\nUkrainian Elections\n\nThroughout the winter of 2019, Giuliani, met with Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko. Lutsenko publicly accused Ukrainian officials of working with the Democratic National Committee and U.S. Embassy in Kiev to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. The Prosecutor General also alleged that former vice president Biden had pressured the sitting Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to close a purported criminal probe into an energy company that Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, sat on the board of. No evidence suggests the former vice president\u2019s son was involved in any lawbreaking.\n\nIn several public comments, Mr. Lutsenko also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General William P. Barr on these matters.\n\nAt the same time, Volodymyr Zelensky was trying to unseat Poroshenko in the Ukrainian presidential election. Zelensky made clear his desire to replace Mr. Lutsenko as Prosecutor General.\n\nBuilding relationships\n\nYuri Lutsenko Other Ukrainian officials Volodymyr Zelensky Prosecutor General of Ukraine President of Ukraine U.S. diplomats Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland reach out to Zelensky.

Yuri Lutsenko Prosecutor General of Ukraine Other Ukrainian officials Rudolph W. Giuliani Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney\n\nOn April 21, Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian election by a landslide, and Trump reached out in a brief congratulatory call. Just over a week later, Marie Yovanovitch, then U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, was suddenly recalled to Washington by senior State Department officials. On May 6, her ambassadorship ended. The whistleblower alleges her assignment ended early because of pressure stemming from Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s allegations.\n\nShortly after the Ukrainian election, associates of Giuliani begin to reach out to Zelensky\u2019s incoming team. Giuliani met with multiple Ukrainian officials and sought to encourage them to pursue investigations beneficial to Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nBy mid-May, multiple U.S. officials were concerned about Giuliani\u2019s engagement with Ukrainian officials. U.S. Diplomats Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland tried to help Ukrainian leaders handle differing messages from Giuliani and official U.S. channels. At the same time, U.S. officials indicated that Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or a phone call between the two Presidents would depend on whether Zelensky showed a willingness to \u201cplay ball\u201d on the issues raised by Lutsenko and Giuliani.\n\n[Former Ukraine prosecutor says Hunter Biden \u2018did not violate anything\u2019]\n\nIn early July, Trump directly requested that the Office of Budget and Management withhold nearly $400 million in security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThe Call\n\nOther Ukrainian officials Volodymyr Zelensky U.S. diplomats Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland meet with Zelensky the next day.

Giuliani Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney\n\nOn the morning of July 25, a day after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s testimony to Congress, Trump held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A dozen White House officials listened in, along with at least one State Department official.\n\nOn the call, Trump twice brought up that the United States had been \u201cvery, very good to Ukraine\u201d before requesting investigations into 2016 election interference and alleged wrongdoings of the Biden family. Trump encouraged Zelensky to meet with Giuliani and Attorney General Barr to further discuss.\n\nFollowing the call, senior White House officials worked to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the conversation. The transcript was stored in a computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information.\n\nDiplomats Volker and Sondland met with Ukrainian leadership the day after the call, reportedly to provide advice on navigating demands Trump had made of President Zelensky.\n\nOn August 2, in a \u201cdirect follow-up\u201d to the call, Giuliani met with one of Zelensky\u2019s advisers in Madrid.\n\nThe Whistleblower Complaint\n\nAtkinson determines that the report is both credible and urgent and sends it to the acting Director of National Intelligence on Aug. 26.

Schiff Chairman of House Intelligence Committee\n\nOn August 12, a whistleblower filed a complaint regarding Trump\u2019s Ukrainian relations to the Inspector General of the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, based on conversations with more than half a dozen U.S. officials.\n\nTwo weeks later, Atkinson, finding the report credible and urgent, forwarded it to Joseph Maguire, the Acting Director of National Intelligence. Maguire determined the complaint did not need to be reported to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\n\nOn Sept. 5, the first mentions of the whistleblower complaint are made public when The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board wrote that it had been \u201creliably told\u201d that Trump was \u201cattempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.\u201d\n\n[Acting intelligence chief Maguire defends his handling of whistleblower complaint in testimony before Congress]\n\nOn Sept. 9, Atkinson notified the committees of the whistleblower complaint. The next day, House Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff requested the full whistleblower complaint from Maguire. When the request was denied on the 13th \u2014 alleging reasons of confidentiality and potentially privileged communications \u2014 Schiff issued a subpoena, which Maguire did not comply with.\n\nOn Sept. 19, Atkinson met behind closed doors with the House Intelligence Committee, but was not authorized to discuss the contents of the complaint.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi urged Maguire to release the complaint, warning of \u201ca whole new stage of the investigation.\u201d On the 24th, she announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nThe following morning, the White House released a detailed memorandum of the call between President Trump and the Ukrainian President Zelensky. Later, the whistleblower complaint, declassified by Maguire, was shared with Congress.\n\nThat next day, Sept. 26, President Trump and Zelensky met in New York during the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on Sept. 25, 2019.
