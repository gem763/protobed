Price, who helped organize the summits for President George W. Bush. \u201cIf I were still the U.S. sherpa and the president was invited to attend a summit at a business resort owned by the foreign leader host, my first question would be to White House counsel about whether ethics rules would permit the president to attend.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s reversal adds another layer to a process that appeared to flout longstanding State Department guidelines for vetting diplomatic event venues \u2014 Mr. Mulvaney said the idea for Doral was thought up in the White House dining room. Still, Mr. Mulvaney said aides created a short list of about a dozen sites, and narrowed it down to three possibilities in Hawaii and Utah.\n\nLocal officials in those states said they were never notified that the White House was scouting for venues for a major event. A spokeswoman for Gary Herbert, the Republican governor of Utah, said that officials did not know that the White House had considered two locations in the state for the Group of 7. And a spokeswoman for David Ige, the Democratic governor of Hawaii, said they determined that the White House was looking for locations only after the fact.", "description": "White House officials would consider another site, the president said, suggesting Camp David was a possibility.", "authors": ["Katie Rogers", "Eric Lipton"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/us/politics/19dc-doral-print/19dc-doral-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
