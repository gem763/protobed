The idea that the PM \u201cput the Queen in an impossible position\u201d, that he forced her to choose between her loyalty to him and her loyalty to parliament, is misguided. Yesterday, the Queen did exactly what she\u2019s always done: as she\u2019s told. According to the uncodified conventions of our constitution, the Queen acts on the advice of a prime minister in whom parliament entrusts executive authority.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

(At least in parliamentary arithmetic \u2013 in the polls, Johnson is still the lesser of two evils). Well, good. If we want to cut the cord with Johnson, we can.\n\nIf MPs want to annul the PM\u2019s authority and reverse the proroguing, they can bring a vote of no confidence or a one-line Act of Parliament. If Jo Swinson wants to realise her party\u2019s raison d\u2019etre and \u201cStop Brexit\u201d, she can suck it up and get behind a Labour-led interim government.\n\nIt\u2019s not up to the Queen to overrule Johnson \u2013 it\u2019s up to MPs. It is political, not royal, inaction that is expediting Brexit. But instead of inveighing against parliamentarians\u2019 incompetence, Remainers are ragging on the one person who \u2013 much as it pains me to say it \u2013 is actually doing her job.\n\nYet the desire for the Queen to stop Brexit is also deeply ironic. Appalled by the PM\u2019s undermining of parliamentary sovereignty, those in uproar sought to undermine it further by having the Queen overrule the PM. Royal political neutrality was the hard-won spoil of the Civil War and one of the few protections British subjects have against royal tyranny \u2013 and centrist Remainers want to throw it out the pram with the rest of their toys. In the hopes of protecting democracy, they are appealing to an inherently antidemocratic institution. Their single-mindedness has become self-defeating.\n\nWhat\u2019s shocking is not that yesterday\u2019s events constituted a coup, but that they didn\u2019t. In seeking the Queen\u2019s permission to prorogue parliament in order to rush through his Brexit plans, Johnson followed the letter of our unwritten constitution \u2013 and there\u2019s the rub.\n\nIn the absence of a rulebook, Johnson has written one himself and ridden roughshod over democracy. Yesterday made clear that, as Aaron Bastani writes, \u201cour system of government is at breaking point\u201d. We should exploit this febrile atmosphere to transform our constitution \u2013 but not in the way some Remainers wanted. Though politically expedient, having the Queen block Brexit would have set a dangerous precedent for the abuse of royal prerogative and crowned her, if not the \u201cshameful Brexit Queen\u201d, the Royal Remainer.\n\nSovereignty shouldn\u2019t lie with the sovereign, but with the people. #AbolishTheMonarchy, sure \u2013 but not because it wasn\u2019t sufficiently monarchical.", "description": "Remainers have run out of people to hate.
