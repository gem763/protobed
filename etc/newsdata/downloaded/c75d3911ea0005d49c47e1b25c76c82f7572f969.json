His countryman Mosinet Geremew claimed silver and Amos Kipruto of Kenya finished third.\n\nHawkins, 27, said after the race in Doha that he was \"gutted\".\n\n\"Maybe I just gave too much in the middle stages. But I couldn't do any more,\" he added.\n\nHawkins revealed prior to the race that he had been training by running on a treadmill with heaters in his garden shed, after he collapsed while leading the marathon at last year's Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast because of the heat.", "description": "Britain's Callum Hawkins has claimed his second successive fourth place in the marathon at the World Championships.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/athletics/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212146727-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOTom2IDArMR5JububTrAx-tnFTrpsYaAoL1DebmRBSo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
