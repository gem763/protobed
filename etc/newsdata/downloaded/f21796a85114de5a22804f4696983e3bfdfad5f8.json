Her husband President Trump stood, stony-faced, to her side.\n\n\u201cAngela Merkel looked at Justin in just the same way and there were no pictures of her,\u201d Margaret Trudeau noted.\n\nStill, Mrs. Trump seemed happy to see Justin Trudeau that day.\n\nHis mother, today dressed in a white shirt, with knotted scarf, roared with laughter. \u201cHe is a tall glass of milk. Everybody likes to look at someone nice. They have met before. They have a friendship. He and Sophie (Gr\u00e9goire-Trudeau, Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife) like Melania very much. He\u2019s always been my prince charming. But this is real life. He\u2019s not just a pretty face, although that doesn\u2019t hurt. I think he is one of the world leaders who can bring the world around to peace, and talk and work together in a democratic way\u2014and there\u2019s not that many of those kinds of leaders left.\n\n\u201cThat photograph was cute, but it was one flash, one moment. A picture tells a story but doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. Donald Trump was right in front of Melania. She was getting ready for a cheek-peck I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty good-looking,\u201d his mother conceded to The Daily Beast. \u201cHe has also lived a full life, he\u2019s also bright. He loves his family, and I love my grandchildren. But I have four children. My second son Sacha (birth name Alexandre; journalist, author, and filmmaker) is more revolutionary, more of a change-maker than Justin could ever be because Justin is trapped within politics, and Sacha is completely free.\u201d\n\nMargaret Trudeau is both diplomatic and mischievous, very open and very discreet. A conversation with her flows, then can stop suddenly. She speaks her mind, but carefully when she must; she was married to Pierre Trudeau, Canada\u2019s charismatic Prime Minister from 1968-79 and 1980-4. She left him in 1977 while he was still in office, scandal swirling after her. She was a first lady determined not to be stifled by the conventions and expectations of that loaded title.\n\nAnd now her and Pierre Trudeau\u2019s son is Prime Minister, meaning Margaret Trudeau has made history in Canada: the first woman to be the wife of one prime minister and mother of another. She notes she is like Barbara Bush in this respect.\n\nTrudeau, 71, is an engaging and expressive storyteller, as her one-woman off-Broadway play, Certain Woman of an Age, shows. Having toured other cities to critical acclaim and appreciative audiences, it will play for three days later this week at the Minetta Lane Theatre, where it will be recorded live for Audible Theater.\n\nThe 80-minute show\u2014co-written with Alix Sobler and directed by Kimberly Senior\u2014takes the audience through a triple-mega rollercoaster life. When she was First Lady (she was married to Pierre from 1971-84, though the couple separated in 1977), Trudeau chafed against the restrictive nature of the role. When they married, Margaret was 22, and Pierre was 51.\n\nShe smoked marijuana, drank, danced at Studio 54, and notoriously partied with the Rolling Stones. After she and Trudeau separated, she had relationships with men including Jack Nicholson, Ryan O\u2019Neal, and entrepreneur Bruce Nevins (who bought Perrier water to America). She was a favorite subject of the paparazzi, who she claims to have loathed passionately then and continues to loathe passionately today. In her 1979 memoir, Beyond Reason, she detailed her infatuation with Senator Ted Kennedy (he denied they had had a relationship).\n\nThen, as Trudeau discusses on stage, tragedy brought her to her lowest ebb: the death of Michel, her youngest son with Trudeau, aged 23 in 1998 caused by an avalanche, and then Pierre Trudeau in 2000. She contemplated suicide. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder and treatment at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Center helped save her life, and Trudeau is now a passionate mental health advocate.\n\nTrudeau is \u201cso proud\u201d of Justin as a prime minister and father. \u201cHe makes time on Sundays for all of us. We go to a lovely country place where we get out the Lego, art, and homework, and there are cuddles and reading and being there together.\u201d\n\nDoes she think her son will win a second term? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Who am I to predict?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our family life\u2014politics. Pierre Trudeau\u2019s mantra for all of us was, \u2018You have to contribute. None of us are businesspeople, none of us are greedy or after money. We are all trying to make the world a better place.\u2019 Justin knew from the time he was small what his destiny was.\u201d\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t know Mr. Trump. I\u2019ve never met him, but my advice to him would be: \u2018Be yourself. Be honest. Be truthful. Don\u2019t be phony-baloney. Just tell the truth. Don\u2019t get caught up in lies. They\u2019ll catch you out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTrudeau said she did not know Melania Trump, and would not know what advice to give her as a fellow first lady who had also not played the conventional first lady role. \u201cBut I wish she\u2019d talk to her husband. I think she\u2019s in charge of an anti-bullying campaign. Perhaps she should share some of her wisdom with him.\u201d\n\nWhat does she think of Trump? Trudeau sighed. \u201cI raised four boys. Boys can be absolute bullies, exaggerators, and liars. But they grow up. I don\u2019t know Mr. Trump. I\u2019ve never met him, but my advice to him would be: \u2018Be yourself. Be honest. Be truthful. Don\u2019t be phony-baloney. Just tell the truth. Don\u2019t get caught up in lies. They\u2019ll catch you out.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Michelle Obama is \u201cone of my heroes. Her time as first lady saw her being incredibly pro-active\u2014not only being a fiercely proud mother but also gardening, getting real, and getting down\u2014and getting into people\u2019s hearts. There\u2019s an aloofness and quietness that means we don\u2019t know much about Melania.\u201d Trudeau \u201ccannot imagine\u201d what it must be like to be married to President Trump.\n\nTrudeau recalled attending the state dinner the Obamas threw for her son before President Obama left office, which she also attended. Trudeau was impressed by how \u201cintelligent, bright and fierce\u201d Sasha and Malia Obama were, \u201cjust like their mother.\u201d The work the Obamas are doing now they have left the White House is \u201cright and honest, they\u2019re great people.\u201d\n\n\u201c We don\u2019t have to be standing next to our husbands beaming. What first ladies have to be is strong women living our own lives, giving support to our partners in terms of being married to them but not being their clone or servant, or responsible for what they are saying \u201d\n\nThe role of the first lady is changing, Trudeau thinks. \u201cSophie does not have to be at Justin\u2019s side while he campaigns, if she doesn\u2019t want to. It can even be to the husband\u2019s detriment if his wife is by his side,\u201d Trudeau added, referencing Melania seemingly swatting away Donald Trump\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to be standing next to our husbands beaming. What first ladies have to be is strong women living our own lives, giving support to our partners in terms of being married to them but not being their clone or servant, or responsible for what they are saying. It\u2019s changing. Women have a different role. We\u2019re not just serving. We\u2019re going to be right up there at the frontline.\u201d\n\n\u201c Who would not want Elizabeth Warren? I do not have a choice. I do not have a vote. But I think she is honest, forthright, and has good visions of helping women gain equality and pay equity\u2014and good ideas on most levels \u201d\n\nAs for women in politics, \u201cIt would be wonderful if a woman could take the presidency of the United States. It would be the beginning of peace in the country. Maybe it\u2019s far off. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Elizabeth Warren is her favorite candidate.\n\n\u201cWho would not want Elizabeth Warren?\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cI do not have a choice. I do not have a vote. But I think she is honest, forthright, and has good visions of helping women gain equality and pay equity\u2014and good ideas on most levels. I am watching from the outside. I have no stakes in the American election and nobody to vote for. Some of other candidates are great, and who doesn\u2019t love Bernie?\u201d She extended the middle \u201cr\u201d into a little, extravagant roar.\n\nHow did Trudeau view about the prospect of a second Trump term?\n\nThere was a long pause. \u201cScary.\u201d\n\nSubject closed.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in my skin. I felt phony\u2019\n\nAfter watching her theater show, women in the audience have told Trudeau she has inspired and helped them by being so open.\n\nTrudeau has left nothing of significance out of the stage play, she insists. \u201cIt is honest, no question\u2014every bit of it is the truth, because the story I am telling is about being authentic and realizing what is within yourself when you\u2019re not doing well and then seeking help and getting better. So many people have mental illness, and just cover it up, mask it up, pretend it will go away or they\u2019re smarter than it. No, we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nTrudeau smiles as she says this, and looks away. She is a natural storyteller, yet also discreet, putting emphatic ends to topics she does not want to elaborate on, and ending answers with sometimes a sweet smile, and sometimes looking very serious, head turned away.\n\nTrudeau grew up with \u201cfour mean sisters,\u201d and a \u201cwonderful\u201d father (James Sinclair, a politician and businessman) and mother Doris. \u201cI had a good life. I was never labeled as having a mental illness. I had such a good mom, who made sure we ate, played, had balance.\u201d Now, Trudeau tries to ensure \u201cfamily legends\u201d are made for her grandchildren through happy camping trips, \u201cso they can look back on them later and say, \u2018That was my childhood.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c I was so unfinished when I was picked by Pierre Trudeau. I was very, very young. I had no idea where I was going \u201d\n\nShe wanted to be an actress or foreign correspondent, because she thought it meant \u201cgetting into a plane and recording exciting things in Paris and Berlin. I was so unfinished when I was picked by Pierre Trudeau. I was very, very young. I had no idea where I was going.\u201d\n\nWhen they met in the ocean off Tahiti in 1968, she was not attracted to him.\n\n\u201cGoodness no. No, he was the same age as my mom. I was much more interested in the young water ski instructor. I did not have that kind of attraction to Pierre Trudeau. He grew on me. He was a beautiful man, so intelligent. We dated for three years before marriage, but secretly. I never had any desire to be in the public eye before marrying him.\u201d\n\nShe was almost 30 years his junior, and not a traditional first lady. She was from \u201ca feminist generation, with a mother who had raised all her daughters to have their own opinions, exercise their own choices, and be in charge of our bodies and futures. We did not have to ask the churches or our fathers how we should live.\u201d Trudeau did not want to be, as she famously put it, \u201ca rose in my husband\u2019s lapel.\u201d\n\nShe was also part of the anti-Vietnam War hippy generation, whose \u201cgentle kindness\u201d she appreciated.\n\n\u201c I tried my hardest. I did my best. I learned how to do it. You just do. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in my skin. I felt phony. I didn\u2019t know what support to contribute. I knew I was supposed to be quiet, I knew I wasn\u2019t respected because I was so young \u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d she said of being first lady. \u201cI tried my hardest. I did my best. I learned how to do it. You just do. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable in my skin. I felt phony. I didn\u2019t know what support to contribute. I knew I was supposed to be quiet, I knew I wasn\u2019t respected because I was so young. I knew my opinions didn\u2019t matter. These feelings kept coming again and again, and they were wrong feelings. That isn\u2019t the way I was raised.\u201d\n\nShe left the marriage because she wanted to be \u201ca whole person\u201d for her children, \u201cnot part of a person.\u201d\n\nHer husband thought he could mold her, she said. \u201cHe underestimated me.\u201d She is adamant that their marriage was not open; she only met other men once they separated. She knows she was judged as a parent and person with her affairs and partying. She seemed to relish the fame and flashbulbs. Apparently not, she claims today.\n\n\u201c The British paparazzi are the worst, the Americans second worst. We have never had any of that in Canada. I hated it. I hated them. They were invasive, rude, provoking. Greedy \u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were not me, living my life,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cThey were voyeurs. They don\u2019t have it right. I don\u2019t like people to be judgy. Everybody has to find their truth and struggle to be real, happy, and complete. The British paparazzi are the worst, the Americans second worst. We have never had any of that in Canada. I hated it. I hated them. They were invasive, rude, provoking. Greedy.\u201d\n\nIf the impression was that Trudeau was reveling in being the \u201cit girl\u201d of the moment, that was not the case, she said.\n\n\u201cI wanted out. I didn\u2019t want to be the person to be pushed, pulled, and hit by cameras. I was not allowed to be. I valued my privacy more than everything. I\u2019m absolutely a freedom fighter, to be used, exploited, and abused. It offended every one of my sensibilities. I knew that beauty was the price of admission for that world, and learned much more as I got wiser about the meaninglessness of that world.\u201d\n\nHer marriage to Pierre broke down, she said, because \u201che was 30 years older. He worked 14 hours a day. We had one hour together every day. I was alone all the time. I was struggling with undiagnosed mental illness. I also had three children in six years. As First Lady I was mostly either pregnant or nursing. My life was not as anyone imagined it was. We weren\u2019t in the same place, not at all Pierre and I.\u201d\n\nTrudeau felt \u201cneglected,\u201d but insists Pierre was a \u201cgentleman,\u201d who had a choice between leaving office to be with her or staying doing the job he was elected to do. \u201cWhat choice is that? He had a big important job, which he was certainly not going to give up and come live with me. He carried on being prime minister for another eight years after I left him.\n\n\u201cWhen you marry someone so young and your brain hasn\u2019t stopped developing you grow out of each other. I impressed upon all my children to be teenagers until they were 30, to not have children till they were 30 have all the fun they could in their 20s.\u201d\n\n\u2018I lived for 25 years in denial of my mental illness\u2019\n\nHer truly wild years came after she left Trudeau. \u201cI had left my husband so my life was in turmoil. I had to leave him.\u201d As she has said before, 24 Sussex (the Canadian Prime Minister\u2019s official residence), was \u201cthe crown jewels of a penitentiary,\u201d and in New York she was \u201clearning to be an actress\u201d with Wynn Handman, artistic director of the American Place Theatre.\n\n\u201cPeople saw paparazzi shots of me in a pretty dress and my hair well done. That took one minute. Most of my life I was struggling to find balance and purpose, to try find the truth of who I was and what was going on. It took a long time. I lived for 25 years in denial of my mental illness.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said of her affair with Jack Nicholson that she liked how free he seemed. They\u2019re no longer in touch, but \u201cI love Jack. I love his movies. He was a very sweet person and I\u2019m sure he still is.\u201d\n\n\u201c There were a lot of drag queens, a lot of great music, a lot of action, and a huge mixture of people form every walk of life. Then it was wiped out with AIDS. You turned around and everyone was gone: Halston, Way Bandy. Actors, artists, gone, gone, gone. It was the worst thing \u201d\n\nStudio 54 was \u201camazing really incredible. I used to go late at night, and dance for a few hours. Everyone was free to be themselves, express themselves. There were a lot of drag queens, a lot of great music, a lot of action, and a huge mixture of people form every walk of life. Then it was wiped out with AIDS. You turned around and everyone was gone: Halston, Way Bandy. Actors, artists, gone, gone, gone. It was the worst thing.\u201d\n\nShe married again (to real estate developer Fried Kemper, from 1984 to 1999) and had two more children. \u201cHappily. It was wonderful. He wasn\u2019t an intellectual. He didn\u2019t have a big important job. We just had a happy life raising the five children. It was very good, but my mental illness, still undiagnosed and undealt with, and the death of my boy shattered everything again. The marriage wasn\u2019t strong enough to withstand.\u201d\n\nOf her grief for Michel, Margaret said, \u201cIt\u2019s not natural to lose your child. It is a battle. We are not taught in western society how to grieve, how to get over loss, how to deal with it. We don\u2019t even deal with the bodies. Some cultures sew the shroud, and in that time with other women women express their grief, finality, making closure. People don\u2019t know to react to us when we have had a loss.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trudeau also did not want to \u201cgive up to a life of mourning. You feel a bit guilty having fun when they\u2019re gone. But wouldn\u2019t they have wanted that, unless they were horrible? My son certainly wasn\u2019t that. Nor was Pierre.\u201d She has found \u201cthe right places\u201d for both dearly loved, and missed, men all in her \u201cvery good spiritual world,\u201d which is not Catholic. She left the Church (having converted to Roman Catholicism when she married Pierre), because of its attitude to women.\n\nOf the MeToo movement, Trudeau said, \u201cIt\u2019s about time. But we knew the rules. Beauty was the price of admission to all that nonsense: the parties, high lifestyle. I think we have to move on and recognize that men have absolutely no right to abuse or harass women.\u201d She herself has not suffered any sexual abuse or harassment, she said, \u201cbut many women have.\u201d\n\n\u2018After my husband died and my boy died I had no more hope in me\u2019\n\nTrudeau has had three \u201chuge, big, manic episodes\u201d that were life-changing. \u201cI have had much more depression that is life-changing, because it isolates you. Most of my life I have not been in the throes of mental illness but at times yes, it can pop up, be triggered, and aggravated. I had the first episode of clinical, really deep depression after the birth of my second child when I was living the most extraordinary, wonderful life. It\u2019s nothing to do with that, your lifestyle, and who you are. It\u2019s all in your brain. The good news is: if you right away get the treatment and close the neural pathways of depression, you will not relapse over and over again when life goes awry.\u201d\n\nPeople with depression and other mental illnesses must get over the fear of being ridiculed, said Trudeau. \u201cThe shame is not having a mental illness, the shame is having one and not doing something about it.\u201d\n\nDid Trudeau ever contemplate suicide? \u201cOh yes. That\u2019s why I finally got the help I needed. After my husband died and my boy died I had no more hope in me. I didn\u2019t do it consciously. I mimicked the last week of life, so no food or water, to a point where I was emaciated and dying in hospital. It took me five years to get well.\u201d (In previous interviews she has described living with anorexia nervosa.)\n\n\u201c I couldn\u2019t swallow any more. When the doctor told me I was in the throes of committing suicide, I got terribly angry because I wasn\u2019t conscious of that. I had four beautiful children and I was not planning to leave them \u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an intensely unhappy time in our lives. I couldn\u2019t swallow any more. When the doctor told me I was in the throes of committing suicide, I got terribly angry because I wasn\u2019t conscious of that. I had four beautiful children and I was not planning to leave them. It was my brain. I had worn myself out battling my mental illness without any success, and then there was the grief, the horrible grief, and inability to find any hope, and the substance abuse.\n\n\u201cAll the things you can do wrong I did. And then I finally got the help I needed and took it on. And I took it on with a vengeance. It took five years of pharmaceuticals and cognitive behavioral therapy, which is the best thing in the world, and changing my habits, the way I eat, everything. The brain is amazing\u2014it takes five years to heal itself after trauma.\u201d\n\nTrudeau recalled suffering from psychosis, while in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s like not connecting to reality, not knowing why I would brush my hair or brush my teeth. With psychosis you completely unlock access to reason. You don\u2019t have any reason. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re an axe murderer or violent person. You\u2019re just nothing. You have delusions, not reality. It didn\u2019t take them long to get me out of psychosis, which is a good thing about modern medicine.\n\nTrudeau dates her return to wellness to 2006, when she started working as mental health advocate. As well as this work, Trudeau has contributed to aid work in Africa.\n\n\u201cI got my joy back. I started laughing again. I wasn\u2019t going to be one of those women who just put black on and mourned my whole life for my lost boy because I had real life all around me.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said she \u201cmonitored\u201d her bipolar disorder now. \u201cIf I feel dark, sad thoughts start to pull me down to a place I do not want to go, I say \u2018You\u2019re not going to take me there\u2019 to my brain, and start cooking, go to a movie, see a friend, go for a walk, because I\u2019m not going there. I\u2019m not going to ruminate and make myself unhappy.\u201d\n\nIf she finds herself getting too \u201chigh,\u201d she makes herself go to sleep. \u201cSleep is my most important weapon. Everything the next day depends on my sleep. The reason I put my head on the pillow is exercise. I am so tired I have no choice but to go to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201c I have been in both places: the depths of despair and depression which is so awful, and in the heights of mania and psychosis even. I have a memory that remembers every minute of everything \u201d\n\nShe takes \u201ca tiny bit of medication, I always will,\u201d and has a therapist (\u201cOf course, don\u2019t we all?\u201d), but she said she was also fortunate to work around the brightest neuroscientists, psychiatrists, and mental healthcare workers. Their wisdom is always welcome.\n\nTrudeau tried to be \u201cpresent\u201d in her life, and recommends others be aware that feeling confused or negative can be \u201ca warning sign\u201d to seek help and not retreat. \u201cI have been in both places: the depths of despair and depression which is so awful, and in the heights of mania and psychosis even. I have a memory that remembers every minute of everything. I don\u2019t want to go back there.\u201d\n\n\u2018I have romance, of course I do, but I\u2019m not going to have marriage\u2019\n\nWhen asked if she is in a relationship now, Trudeau said she was \u201cbeyond politics, beyond men. I am quite single. I haven\u2019t got time. I have had two marriages which when they were happy were very, very happy, and when they were miserable they were miserable. I have nine grandchildren and a lot of work to do. Because I\u2019m bipolar, when I\u2019m \u2018out\u2019 and \u2018on\u2019 I have to have time at home and be \u2018off\u2019, and be really quiet.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI guess there is not much time for me to wash men\u2019s socks and clear up their clothes.\u201d\n\nShe has \u201cno idea\u201d if she will marry again. \u201cI don\u2019t think marriage is what most women think about at my age. What we ultimately want is to be free.\u201d Does she miss sex, romance? \u201cNot at my age, I don\u2019t need to miss anything. I have romance, of course I do, but I\u2019m not going to have marriage.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cThere has been romance and there possibly will be again.\u201d\n\nTrudeau doesn\u2019t get nervous before performing the play, or emotional. It\u2019s been great to work with strong American feminists, she said. The difficulty was compressing everything into 80 minutes; she had enough stories for four hours, she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to have a good memory. I cultivate my memory every day, by taking what happened, smell it, see it, put a color on it, and file it away.\u201d\n\nShe said she feels as young as she always did, and doesn\u2019t fear aging\u2014just losing control over her own life. \u201cI am going to fight for my wellness. I am never going to have a geriatric assessment. Ever.\u201d She laughed. \u201cDeath is death. If you don\u2019t accept death you don\u2019t accept birth. I used to fear death, but I don\u2019t any more, because I faced it head-on and I know you can survive.\u201d\n\nTrudeau paused. \u201cI think that having a death wish is something we need to think about if we have bad habits, like smoking. Ask yourself. Is this a habit or is this a death wish? Do I really not want to live a whole life? Am I testing the gods? Am I trying to get myself sick?\u201d\n\n\u201c You can label someone an alcoholic or junkie, but you need to go deeper and find out why this person is the way they are \u201d\n\nDealing with her drug and alcohol problems meant understanding they were affecting how her brain was functioning. \u201cYou can label someone an alcoholic or junkie, but you need to go deeper and find out why this person is the way they are.\u201d One reason she hardly drinks alcohol now is that \u201cyou have to be cognizant of the amount of sugar you\u2019re eating, and there are other ways I like my sugar.\u201d Cannabis is no longer a big part of her life, though she swears by CBD oils for helping ease the pain of an injured knee.\n\nTrudeau is writing her fifth book, a mixture of non-fiction and fiction, and is selling the rights of her books to be made into movies (she has no dream Hollywood star in mind to play her).\n\nHer life, Trudeau said, is \u201ca work in progress. Change is the only constant. That\u2019s the one thing I have absolutely learnt. You can\u2019t depend on anything staying the same. It\u2019s not going to. Be ready for change. Be ready for transitions. Be ready. Courage sometimes means taking a step out of life to nothing, to find more. Some people don\u2019t have that courage.\u201d\n\nDid she? \u201cOh yes, I\u2019ve always had it. That\u2019s why Pierre underestimated me, thinking he could turn me into a nice little Catholic, servile wife.\u201d\n\nTrudeau lives in Montr\u00e9al, with three of her grandchildren just a few blocks away. \u201cI had no idea grandma would be my best role,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI adore them. I don\u2019t have to raise them\u2014I just have to love them. I see my children in them. I see the past and the future in them. They make me laugh so much. They call me \u2018grandma yummy.\u2019 I give them car candies.\u201d\n\nDoes she feel fulfilled? \u201cOh yes. Every day I wake up happy and ready. We all have worries and fears. I think I have got mine in proportion only because I got the help that I got.\u201d\n\n\u201c Get someone disinterested\u2014a therapist, guidance counselor, someone outside your circle. They won\u2019t repeat what you say or offer phony words to appease you \u201d\n\nIn 2013, in honor of her mental health work, Trudeau received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Western Ontario. To those concerned with their own mental health, she recommends sorting out sleep patterns if they are disturbed, because sleep is so rejuvenating. \u201cThen talk to somebody who isn\u2019t your mother, sister, best friend, who has a vested interest, who isn\u2019t going to be shocked, hurt, or surprised by what you say. Get someone disinterested\u2014a therapist, guidance counselor, someone outside your circle. They won\u2019t repeat what you say or offer phony words to appease you.\u201d\n\nFeminism is, indeed always has been, important to her, \u201cnot even as a word\u2014just as in being a strong woman, nobody pushing me around and not listening. Strong women with strong voices. And I seem to be surrounded by a lot of women out there who have pretty strong voices.\u201d\n\nTrudeau laughed again, heartily. Were those women\u2019s voices sustaining for her? \u201cYes, absolutely. Let\u2019s hear more of them.\u201d Another merry laugh, and then Margaret Trudeau was off to her next adventure.", "description": "Margaret Trudeau talks to Tim Teeman about Melania Trump\u2019s G7 gaze at her son Justin; as well as bringing her life\u2014Canadian first lady, drugs, Studio 54, mental illness\u2014to theater.", "authors": ["Tim Teeman", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568179127/190911-teeman-margaret-trudeau-hero_pcdhho", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
