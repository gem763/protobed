General Assembly late last month that India had \"invaded and occupied\" Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan.\n\nThe boycott of Malaysian palm oil was likely temporary as supplies from Indonesia alone were not enough to meet demand in India, Malaysia's economic affairs minister, Azmin Ali, said.\n\n\"We are confident that very soon, we will be able to resolve this matter effectively,\" Azmin told parliament on Wednesday.\n\nAzmin also defended Mahathir's remarks, saying that Malaysia should be free to voice its opinions on international issues.\n\nMahathir has said he will not retract his comments despite the palm oil boycott.\n\nIndia revoked the status of its Jammu and Kashmir state in August and on Wednesday moved to split the state into two territories.\n\nNew Delhi has rejected criticism from foreign countries on its actions in the region, insisting it was an internal affair.
