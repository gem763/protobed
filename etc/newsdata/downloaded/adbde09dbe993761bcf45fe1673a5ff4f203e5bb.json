I don't want to get flashbacks Jamie. It was one of those... I was in Cyprus, I didn't want to tell people where I was at the time.\n\n'I didn't want Stavros Flatley to come running as I knew they'd come running to look after me with loads of sweets of stuff, they're going to text me now and kill me.\n\nIncredible: Amanda still managed to maintain her signature style sense when it came to her footwear choice as she sported one classic stiletto\n\nCheeky: Looking every inch the scooting pro, the former This Morning host gave the camera a smouldering gaze and seductively tossed her hair during her lively ride\n\n'It was like an inflatable assault course, like Wipe Out, my eldest daughter [Alexa, 13] was on a school trip so Hollie was with me and Chris and she was desperate to get on this thing.'\n\nAdmitting she had to step in as the more athletic parent on the trip, she added: 'If you've seen my husband's hair, it's fabulous, so he didn't want to get his hair ruined, so he was standing on the side.\n\n'So I said I won't read my book, I'll try and be a good mother. So I ended up going on the assault course and went round and round on my hands and knees like geriatric I am.\n\n'There were some kids who bashed into Hollie and so I said: ''Excuse me, you can't do that on this'' while looking around for their parents.\n\n'I ended up going on the assault course like geriatric I am': During her show with Jamie Theakston, 48, Amanda revealed how she sustained her injury during a family trip to Cyprus\n\n'I'm in full glam and a lash, things aren't that bad! I feel like a one-legged dog': She insisted she's experience worse things in life\n\n'Hollie was upset, so I raised my voice to these little gits. Hollie swam off, so I had to follow her, and there were these three stepping stones that I crawled over.'\n\nSharing the moment she broke her leg, the TV star added: 'I ran on them really quick, made it, and then I got to the inflatable platform, but fell and twisted my leg back on itself, and fell back into the sea.\n\n'I'd never broken anything in my life, it felt like a shift. I've pulled tendons before so it felt like that but a bit worse. In the leg, I felt sick. I swam back one-legged while swearing and trying to wave at Chris.'\n\nShe insisted she's experience worse things in life as she explained: 'I had to be put under a general [anaesthetic]... They've put a metal plate [into my leg] which is the best way to heal it because I'm very impatient.\n\nUnfortunate: She previously revealed she is 'totally gutted' after breaking her leg in two places while 'showing off' on an inflatable assault course on day one of her holiday\n\n'There's a cast which they molded just under my leg, so I can lift my leg in and out of it, so it's hard underneath but soft on the top. I'm in full glam and a lash, things aren't that bad! I feel like a one-legged dog'.\n\nEarlier this week, Amanda defiantly attended Lisa Faulkner and John Torode's wedding in Banbury.\n\nShe previously revealed she is 'totally gutted' after breaking her leg in two places while 'showing off' on an inflatable assault course on day one of her family holiday.\n\nAmanda said on her radio show: 'I\u2019ve broken my fibula in two places and I was rushed to hospital.
