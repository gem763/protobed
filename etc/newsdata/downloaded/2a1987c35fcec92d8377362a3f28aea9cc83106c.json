Show Hide Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa's cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town's spectacular beaches and trendy cafes. Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the \"other Soweto\", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper. Nick Van Mead\n\nThe country and its cities were sharply divided. The Group Areas Act dictated that people of different races lived in separate areas, with black people forced to live in townships far from the centre of cities. Public spaces such as parks and beaches were segregated, and there were white-only schools and hospitals. The government restricted the type of jobs black people could do and controlled their movement.\n\nNelson Mandela and the African National Congress party came to power in 1994, ushering in a new era for the country.\n\nA quarter of a century on, how has life changed for those living in its cities?\n\nShare your experiences\n\nWe want to hear your views about how life in South African cities has changed in the last 25 years. Are there any aspects of a city or city life you feel have remained the same? If you live in South Africa, how do you feel about the future of your city?\n\nShare your comments, experiences and thoughts with us by filling in the encrypted form below (which you can do anonymously if you choose) or tweet us at @GuardianCities.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble using the form, click here.
