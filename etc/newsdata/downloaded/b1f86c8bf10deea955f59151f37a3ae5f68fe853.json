And he has been equally clear on his plans to send law enforcement personal to the homes of those who refuse to hand over their rifles.\n\nOn October 16, 2019, Breitbart News reported O\u2019Rourke telling MSNBC that law enforcement will visit the non-compliant to \u201crecover\u201d rifles.\n\nSheriff Mark Gage is not in line with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan. In fact, Townhall quoted Cage saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether his statements are naive or just plain ignorant and arrogant. Maybe it\u2019s all three.\u201d\n\nCage continued, \u201cThe thought of anyone utilizing my sheriff\u2019s office or any other law enforcement agency in this country as their personal Gestapo to go door to door violating citizen\u2019s rights is disgusting, unrealistic and downright un-American.\u201d\n\nCage believes \u201cbloodshed\u201d will the be unavoidable outcome of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plans, should they ever be put in place. He said, \u201cSome of my constituents are already adopting the mantra of \u2018Come take mine Beto!\u2019\u2026His rhetoric has gotten old and I look forward to the day when he shuts up.\u201d\n\nWeld County, Colorado, Sheriff Steve Reams shared similar sentiment, calling O\u2019Rourke\u2019s plan \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d\n\nReams said his deputies would be placed \u201cin the crosshairs\u201d by any attempt to carry out confiscatory plans like those pushed by O\u2019Rourke. And he worries the confiscatory efforts would also endanger citizens.\n\nHe concluded, \u201cI think that you have to be concerned for the safety of the citizen [too] because, at that point, they don\u2019t know if law enforcement is coming to protect them or disarm them and that creates a very tense situation.\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News.
