Untested products have potential health risks and are not considered safe.\n\nThe department recently warned that it is illegal to sell CBD outside of the dozen state cannabis dispensaries.\n\n\u201cOur state is trying to figure out how we can responsibly move forward and remove those products which are potentially hazardous or harmful,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nCBD is banned by the Food and Drug Administration in food, drinks and dietary supplements, officials said. However, it\u2019s a prescription drug and it\u2019s being added to foods, but it is technically unapproved.\n\n\u201cThe big issue with unregulated hemp products has to do with (the fact that) we don\u2019t know where the CBD is coming from,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not tested, really, they don\u2019t belong on shelves. A lot of things can cause the kind of pneumonia showing up and killing people, which should be scary to you. It really, honestly poses a general threat.\u201d\n\nMore than 450 cases of severe lung illnesses have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including at least six deaths.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hawaii health officials have announced plans to remove unregulated CBD products after Hawaii records its first suspected case of severe respiratory illness related to vaping, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
