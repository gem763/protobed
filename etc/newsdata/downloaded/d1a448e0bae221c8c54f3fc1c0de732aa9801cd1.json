The car was down the embankment facing uphill at about 45 degrees. It was also tilting over by the same amount.\n\nHarry Schild, 69, watches in horror as a Volkswagen Golf speeds the wrong way down a slip road in Thirsk, North Yorkshire\n\nWith just seconds to stop the two cars slamming into each other, Mr Schild swerves to the left, but the Volkswagen driver moves the same way\n\n'He asked if I would help him push the car up. He felt sure that if I pushed from behind he could drive the car back on the road. I told him to come round the car quickly.\n\n'If it slipped and rolled over he would be crushed. He eventually did comply, but kept saying 'I'm sure we can get it out'.\n\n'I tried to explain that on grass at that angle the car would almost certainly roll over if any attempt to move it were made, and that it could do so on it's own. It was in a very precarious position.\n\n'I asked if he had breakdown cover. He said he didn't want to call them as it was a company car and he'd get into trouble.\n\n'I decided at that point that I didn't want to be involved any further as I felt sure he would try again to move the car.\n\nThe Volkswagen then swings sharply to the right and careers off the road and into a ditch\n\nMr Schild said he then called North Yorkshire Police, which confirmed they attended the scene of the near-miss.\n\nA force spokesperson said: 'Police received a report of a blue VW Golf in a ditch by the slip road off the A1(M) towards the A168, at about 1pm on Friday 5 July 2019.\n\n'Officers attended and assisted with recovering the car. There were no reports of any injuries.'", "description": "Harry Schild, 69, was driving with his wife on the A1 near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, when he spotted blue Volkswagen Golf hurtling towards him.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19496430-0-image-a-32_1570633012466.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
