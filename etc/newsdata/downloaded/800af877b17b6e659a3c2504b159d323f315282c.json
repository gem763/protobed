But I also say that it is inescapable that Greece has to make reforms,\u201d said Guindos.\n\nThe closest European ally of Greece\u2019s ruling Syriza party, Podemos hailed the result as a political landmark brushing off questions whether the vote was good for his party.\n\n:\n\n\u201cI think we have to be very happy just for the fact that there has been a referendum in Greece,\u201d leader Pablo Iglesias told the assembled media. \u201cRegarding the result, as I said before, I think that it is a result that brings us into a better future for a democratic Europe,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Greek referendum had become a tender point in Madrid, as the centre-right government fights to assert itself in the face of the astronomic rise of the anti-austerity Podemos party ahead of elections later this year.", "description": "Spanish Economy Minister Luis De Guindos says a Greek exit was not being contemplated by Madrid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/309422/1000x563_309422.jpg", "published_at": "2015-07-06"}
