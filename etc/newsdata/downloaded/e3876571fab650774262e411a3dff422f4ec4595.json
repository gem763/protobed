Believe or not, I am an attorney. Everything I did was to defend my client. I am proud of what I did,\" Giuliani replied, saying he discovered a \"massive pay-to-play scheme, not unlike the Clinton Foundation.\"\n\nAfter Stephanopoulos repeatedly asked Giuliani about his cooperation, Giuliani said, \"I wouldn't cooperate with Adam Schiff. I think Adam Schiff should be removed. If they remove Adam Schiff, if they put a neutral person in who hasn't pre-judge the case. If they put someone in, a Democrat, who hasn't expressed an opinion yet,\" then he will \"consider it.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Andy Biggs introduced a resolution on Friday to censure Schiff for reading an alternate version of President Donald Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the beginning of their hearing with Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire about the whistleblower complaint.\n\nSchiff later said his alterations to the transcript, where he read that Trump told the Ukrainian President \u201cseven times\u201d to \u201cmake up dirt on my political opponent,\" were a \"parody.\"\n\n\"Through this process, if the President has committed high crimes or misdemeanors, Congress may overturn the election of the President and the will of the American people. It is therefore inexcusable to toy with the process and mislead the American public with such a statement,\" Biggs said.", "description": ".09/29/2019 19:27:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/239/7d2ccc6a-215b-4aa5-8388-f50eb4ba5a16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
