But it\u2019s important to expect the unexpected and plan for the possibility of an emergency.\n\n\u201cUnfamiliar areas, exotic foods, insect-borne illnesses and adventurous activities can all lead to illness or injury,\u201d E. Patricia Gill, an infectious disease and travel medicine specialist in Longmont, Colorado, told HuffPost. \u201cAccidents happen. Nearly half of all medical evacuations back to the United States are the result of a car crash, and emergency care and trauma centers are uncommon outside urban areas.\u201d\n\nHuffPost asked Gill and other experts how travelers can be proactive before their trip and what they should know about seeking medical attention in a foreign country.\n\n\u201cBeing prepared for these types of situations can alleviate some of the stress should travelers, and/or their companions, find themselves needing to go to the hospital,\u201d said Robert Quigley, a surgeon and senior vice president at the medical and travel support companies International SOS and MedAire.\n\nHere\u2019s how to prepare for the possibility of hospitalization abroad and what to do if the situation arises.\n\nGo To The Doctor Beforehand\n\n\u201cPrevention is always better than treatment,\u201d said Gill, who recommends visiting a travel medicine clinic and discussing your itinerary and health to get personalized advice, immunizations and preventative medicines.\n\n\u201cYou may be given medications for early self treatment of diarrhea or medicine for prevention or treatment of altitude illness,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can discuss prevention of blood clots, protection against bug bites, safe food choices and many other potential health issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing prepared for these types of situations can alleviate some of the stress should travelers, and or their companions find themselves needing to go to the hospital.\u201d - Robert Quigley, senior VP of the medical and travel support companies International SOS and MedAire\n\nGill also noted that other countries may have different standards of sanitation and sterility than what we\u2019re accustomed to in the U.S., so it\u2019s important to be immunized, particularly against hepatitis B which is passed by blood and other bodily fluids.\n\nStock Up On Meds\n\nYour pre-travel doctor visit is a good time to get a refill of your prescriptions and stock up on medication for the trip. Daphne Hendsbee, a communications and marketing specialist at the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers (IAMAT), recommends getting extra meds and keeping them in the original, labelled containers.\n\n\u201cCheck with the foreign embassy of the country you are visiting or transiting [through] to make sure your medications are permitted in that country,\u201d she advised.\n\nCheck Your Insurance\n\nTravelers should investigate if they need travel health or evacuation insurance, as many health insurance plans don\u2019t provide coverage out of the country.\n\n\u201cMake sure that you take copies of your insurance card and insurance company contact information,\u201d said Quigley. \u201cYour insurance company may have additional information for you, including the requirement to purchase excess coverage. This is particularly important if you have an underlying mental health disorder.\u201d\n\n\u201cDepending on your policy, you may have to seek care from the doctors and hospitals in the insurer\u2019s network,\u201d Hendsbee noted. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re covered for any preexisting conditions and find out if they have a preferred provider network.\u201d\n\nResearch Your Destination\n\nQuigley recommended researching your destination\u2019s healthcare infrastructure and what medical care is offered in different areas, particularly rural ones. Travelers can also research any endemic diseases, as well as best practices against contracting them.\n\n\u201cBefore traveling to any foreign destination, make sure to identify the nearest hospital and learn whether it is in a neighborhood with any security concerns,\u201d he advised, adding that insurance companies and travel assistance providers can share this information. \u201cThis not only notifies them in advance, but oftentimes, they are able to offer additional insight into emergency advice and best practices to stay safe.\u201d\n\nIt may also be useful to learn about local laws and culture, like basic driving practices.\n\nPrint Your Documents\n\n\u201cIf you have a medical condition or are taking prescription medication, travel with a letter from your health practitioner that includes the generic and brand name of your medication, the condition being treated, the dosage, and details of any medical devices or supplies if needed. If possible, have the letter translated into your destination country\u2019s language,\u201d said Hendsbee.\n\n\u201cHaving documentation for medical conditions and prescriptions will help facilitate treatment at your destination,\u201d she continued. \u201cCarry a card that identifies \u2014 in the local language \u2014 your blood type, any chronic illnesses you have, medications you take (including their generic names) and any allergies you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf possible, have a friend or family member stay with you to help with communication and personal care.\u201d - E. Patricia Gill, infectious disease and travel medicine specialist\n\nQuigley noted that travelers should also have printed copies of their passports, health insurance cards and travel insurance information both in their luggage and back at home with a trusted loved one. He also advised carrying papers with lists of emergency contacts, allergies, any current or chronic illnesses, and contact information for your primary care physician and/or travel doctor.\n\nUse Resources\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department offer advice for medical care while traveling abroad. Travelers can also register with the State Department\u2019s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive emergency updates and other resources. U.S. embassies can assist in locating medical care and contacting loved ones at home, so it\u2019s helpful to learn where embassies are located and how to contact them.\n\nTravel assistance hotlines can also be instrumental in finding medical services and communicating with healthcare professionals who may not speak English. IAMAT\u2019s medical directory also helps travelers locate English-speaking doctors and, when in doubt, university hospitals tend to offer reliable medical care with specialists and have English-speaking doctors.\n\nHave A Friend Stay With You\n\nIf you\u2019re not traveling solo, don\u2019t go to the hospital alone.\n\n\u201cIf possible, have a friend or family member stay with you to help with communication and personal care,\u201d said Gill. \u201cThis person should also have a copy of your important medical and insurance information.\u201d\n\nTake Out Cash\n\nHaving cash in the local currency is a smart move while traveling in general, and it can be particularly useful in a medical situation.\n\n\u201cMany locations require cash or a guarantee of payment upfront, regardless of the seriousness of your condition,\u201d said Quigley.\n\nKeep Your Records\n\nIf you find yourself receiving medical care abroad, be sure to keep copies of any receipts or invoices for hospital care or tests.\n\n\u201cIf you have to pay out of pocket, you may be required to submit these documents to your insurer when you file a claim,\u201d said Hendsbee.\n\n\u201cAsk for a copy of your medical record when you are discharged, including discharge summary, lab results and imaging results,\u201d Gill advised.\n\nFollow Up\n\nThe story of your medical issue abroad doesn\u2019t end after your trip is over.", "description": "Whether you contract an illness or have an accident, here\u2019s how to handle a medical event in a foreign country.", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da9f25d200000f3135061de.jpeg?cache=gbHVUKrB2k&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
