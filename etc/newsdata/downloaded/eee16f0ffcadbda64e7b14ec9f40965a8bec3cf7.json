'I'm as disappointed as everyone else is in the locker room.\n\n'We had chances and we did not take advantage of them. For us, two points escaped us, but we also have to see the rest of the teams and what they will do on a trip as difficult as this one.'\n\nAlthough Atletico laboured in their performance and were fortunate to strike late on, they could have wrapped the game up before Perez's equaliser with Morata wasting an opportunity to double his tally for the evening.\n\nBut Lucas Perez equalised in the 83rd minute to give Atletico a fourth draw from five games\n\nDiego Simeone was left to reflect on another frustrating night for his Atletico side\n\nConceding late on denied Atletico the chance to go level on points with Barcelona at the top\n\nHowever, manager Diego Simeone refused to blame his forward for the pivotal moment, choosing instead to praise Fernando Pacheco for a great save.\n\n'The goalkeeper made a great stop, the ball was not going wide of the goal,' Simeone said.\n\n'Alvaro was fine and the goalkeeper kept Alaves in the game because the match was over with the second goal.'", "description": "Having scored just once in his first seven games of the season, Morata netted the opening goal in the Spanish top flight clash to take his tally to three goals in as many matches.", "authors": ["Dan Ripley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/08/20365194-0-image-a-11_1572425588266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
