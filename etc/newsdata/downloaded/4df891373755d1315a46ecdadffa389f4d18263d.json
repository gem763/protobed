USA TODAY\n\nThough the going rate for college football coaches seems to reset every few years, the sport changed forever on Dec. 1, 2017 when Texas A&M agreed to pay Jimbo Fisher $75 million over 10 years.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the size of the salary or length of the deal that made it an outlier. It was the fact that Texas A&M was willing to commit such massive money to a coach who was not exactly a slam dunk to make the Aggies a national championship-level program.\n\nYes, Fisher had won a title at Florida State in 2013 with arguably one of the best college football teams of all time. But winning a championship at Florida State, where it has been done before, is not the same as doing it at Texas A&M, where they\u2019ve finished a season in the top 10 just six times since 1970. Plus, Fisher\u2019s program at Florida State had been somewhat on the decline for three straight years, exposing his offensive rigidity and refusal to embrace analytics on things like fourth-down conversions.\n\nThough it\u2019s still extremely early in Fisher\u2019s tenure, his 13-7 overall record at Texas A&M hasn\u2019t exactly made the traditional SEC powers nervous. But because every dollar of his contract is guaranteed \u2014 that\u2019s $60.6 million at the end of this regular season \u2014 he\u2019s under no administrative pressure for the foreseeable future.\n\nNo matter what happens, Texas A&M and Fisher are stuck with each other for at least the next handful of years. Maybe that will be a good thing if Fisher starts beating Alabama and LSU regularly and contending for the SEC championship. But for now, that contract makes Fisher look massively overpaid.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one, though. Given the constant churn of the coaching carousel, the short supply of proven winners out there to hire and the pressure on administrators to keep successful coaches, plenty of schools are getting taken to the cleaners in contract negotiations these days. Here are the eight worst contracts this year in college football, :\n\nJimbo Fisher is in his second season as head coach at Texas A&M after leading Florida State for eight years. (Photo: Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n1. Jimbo Fisher, Texas A&M\n\nTotal 2019 compensation: $7.5 million\n\nContract end date: Dec. 31, 2027\n\nBuyout: $60.6 million\n\nWhy the school paid so much: Since joining the SEC in 2012, Texas A&M\u2019s answer to every problem has been to throw money at it. So when it was time to jettison Kevin Sumlin, who earned a hefty $10.4 million buyout himself with no offset provision if he took a new job, the Aggies were going to do whatever it took to get a coach with \u201cnational champion\u201d on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. And, clearly, it took a lot. For Texas A&M, though, just being able to pull Fisher away from a blueblood program in Florida State was an achievement in and of itself for a school that enjoys genuflecting in its financial strength as much as it does winning on the field.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a bad contract: Massively overrated to start this season, Texas A&M will finish 7-5 if its remaining games go as expected. That means Fisher\u2019s first two years won\u2019t be much different record-wise than Sumlin\u2019s final two. Though recruiting has gone well for Fisher, there\u2019s a legitimate question about whether his best days as an offensive innovator/quarterback guru are behind him. When you look at the evolution of programs like Alabama and LSU, Fisher\u2019s pro style system looks like a relic and relies heavily on a complicated playbook that not all quarterbacks can handle. As we saw late in his tenure at Florida State and early this season, Fisher\u2019s offense falls apart without a great offensive line. If Fisher can\u2019t evolve the way other top programs have, Texas A&M will be paying an above-market rate mostly for the national championship he won with another school.\n\nCRUNCHING NUMBERS: 6 surprising numbers from college football coaches salaries report\n\nOPINION: 7 worst deals among college football coaches contracts\n\nBIG BUYOUT: Does Gus Malzahn\u2019s massive buyout at Auburn make him untouchable?\n\nCoach Dana Holgorsen had a 61-41 record in eight seasons at West Virginian before moving to Houston this season. (Photo: Maria Lysaker, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n2. Dana Holgorsen, Houston\n\nTotal 2019 compensation: $3.7 million\n\nContract end date: Dec. 31, 2023\n\nBuyout: $13.2 million\n\nWhy the school paid so much: Few institutions in all of college sports have a higher hubris-to-accomplishment ratio than Houston. The Cougars think they belong in a Power Five league and the way to get there is dominating the American Athletic Conference, no matter how unrealistic that might be. So when the school dumped Major Applewhite after just two seasons, the Cougars and megabooster Tilman Fertitta were determined to spend big on a splashy hire \u2014 and what better way to grab headlines than pulling a coach away from a Power Five school? Though Holgorsen wanted out of West Virginia badly, landing a 5-year, $20 million contract in a city he likes living in is a pretty nice soft landing.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a bad contract: It seems highly unlikely Holgorsen will ever take the Cougars where they want to go. Though Houston has good recruiting geography and attractive facilities, it\u2019s not going to consistently recruit like a Power Five team unless or until it\u2019s in a Power Five league. That means it\u2019s going to be hard to create a real talent gap with the rest of the AAC, which has a number of strong programs including UCF, Memphis, Temple and Navy. Holgorsen is a good coach with a solid track record, but he\u2019s never finished a season higher than ranked No. 17. And for all the talk about Houston\u2019s potential, it\u2019s only won two conference titles in the past 20 years. That doesn\u2019t sound like a combination primed to live up to a contract that busted the market for Group of Five teams.\n\nWillie Taggart had head coaching stops at Western Kentucky, South Florida and Oregon before moving to Florida State in 2018. (Photo: Glenn Beil, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n3. Willie Taggart, Florida State\n\nTotal 2019 compensation: $5 million\n\nContract end date: Jan 31, 2024\n\nBuyout: $17.7 million\n\nWhy the school paid so much: When Fisher left for Texas A&M, Taggart seemed like the obvious choice to replace him. Taggart had turned around two smaller programs at Western Kentucky and South Florida, and particularly in Tampa had shown a strong ability to recruit in the talent-rich I-4 corridor. The problem was that Taggart already had a good job at Oregon, and no matter how badly he wanted to return to his home state, he wasn\u2019t going to leave after one year without getting a significant raise. With Oregon reportedly offering around $4 million a year to stay, Florida State had no choice but to pony up.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a bad contract: The Taggart era has been a major disappointment, and this already looks like a situation where the school would consider moving on if not for the massive buyout he\u2019s owed. Though many of the early problems can be traced to roster erosion in Fisher\u2019s final years, the Seminoles missed a bowl game last season for the first time since 1981 and have looked unprepared and poorly coached on several occasions. Though wins over Louisville and N.C. State recently seemed like a step forward, Florida State got humiliated by Clemson 45-14 on Oct. 12, showing how big the gap remains. Taggart also hasn't exactly set the world on fire in recruiting, which seemed like a given when he got the job.\n\nBefore becoming coach at Michigan, Jim Harbaugh had a four-year stint at Stanford where he went 29-21, including 12-1 in 2010. (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n4. Jim Harbaugh, Michigan\n\nTotal 2019 compensation: $7.5 million\n\nContract end date: Jan. 10, 2022\n\nBuyout: $11.688 million\n\nWhy the school paid so much: It\u2019s hard to remember now, but most people outside of Michigan were skeptical that Harbaugh would even be willing to return to college football in 2014 given how successful he\u2019d been in the NFL. That\u2019s why a desperate Michigan couldn\u2019t mess around and go cheap. In order to make a real run at Harbaugh, there was no choice but to offer a landmark contract. Now, however, that deal has just two seasons remaining on it, which is almost unheard of in big-time college sports. It will be interesting to see if either side seriously engages on an extension and what that might look like, given the underwhelming results so far.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a bad contract: Though Harbaugh has been far from a disaster, there was no ambiguity about the expectations when he took the job. And those expectations have not been met. The reason you pay a coach $7.5 million a year is to contend for national titles, win conference titles and beat your biggest rivals. Five years in, Harbaugh hasn\u2019t done any of that, although he came awful close in 2016. Had one spot of a football changed by two inches against Ohio State that year, Harbaugh might have won the Big Ten and been in the College Football Playoff. But without those signature wins, it\u2019s hard to justify the contract.\n\nKirby Smart went 13-2 in his second season at Georgia, losing in the College Football Playoff finale. (Photo: Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n5. Kirby Smart, Georgia\n\nTotal 2019 compensation: $6.87 million\n\nContract end date: Dec. 31, 2024\n\nBuyout: $24.24 million\n\nWhy the school paid so much: Smart\u2019s contract has changed significantly in a relatively short period of time. When he was initially hired as a first-time head coach, Smart\u2019s deal with Georgia averaged around $3.75 million per year, which was slightly less than his predecessor Mark Richt was making. But after Smart\u2019s second season when he led Georgia to the SEC championship and within a whisker of winning the College Football Playoff, the school locked him up to a seven-year, $49 million deal. That essentially brings him in line contractually with Auburn\u2019s Gus Malzahn, who has also won an SEC title and made a national championship game.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a bad contract: The largesse of Smart\u2019s deal is tied almost exclusively to the market rate established by his peers, not the demand for him specifically. In other words, if Georgia had told Smart that it would pay him $5 million a year with a $10 million buyout \u2014 take it or leave it \u2014 would there be another college program or NFL team willing to pay him more or offer him a better situation? Probably not. Smart is a Georgia guy who is uniquely positioned at his alma mater to capitalize on an in-state talent base that\u2019s good enough to win the national title. And yet if he doesn\u2019t deliver that in the next few years \u2014 remember, Richt\u2019s record through his first 3\u00bd seasons was just as good as Smart\u2019s \u2014 this will look like a big overpay.\n\nKirk Ferentz has a 157-103 record in 20-plus seasons at Iowa. (Photo: Reese Strickland, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n6. Kirk Ferentz, Iowa\n\nTotal 2019 compensation: $4.8 million\n\nContract end date: Jan. 31, 2026\n\nBuyout: $21.571 million\n\nWhy the school paid so much: It\u2019s not written into state law that Ferentz will get a new contract every few years that extends out another decade, but it sure seems that way. This is Ferentz\u2019s 21st season at Iowa, and he\u2019s signed for six more, which means he\u2019d be 70 when this current deal expires. Ferentz got his first big deal early in his tenure after three straight top-10 finishes as Iowa had to fight off significant interest from the NFL. They gave him a 10-year extension after the Hawkeyes went 11-2 in 2009 with a trip to the Orange Bowl. And then after 2015, when Iowa went 12-0 in the regular season and nearly beat Michigan State for the Big Ten title and a Playoff spot, he got another 10-year deal that essentially locks him in for the rest of his career.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a bad contract: Just on principle, a 10-year contract for an older coach who is not competing at an elite level on a regular basis is a bad idea. Though Ferentz has certainly had some great moments at Iowa, it has basically been a middle-of-the-pack Big Ten program for the last decade with an occasional pop of national relevance. That\u2019s OK for now, but if there ever comes a point where it looks like Ferentz is slipping, his contract may make it prohibitive to wind down his tenure amicably.\n\nChad Morris went 14-23 in three seasons at SMU before taking over at Arkansas. (Photo: Nelson Chenault, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n7. Chad Morris, Arkansas\n\nTotal 2019 compensation: $4 million\n\nContract end date: Dec. 31, 2023\n\nBuyout: $10.004 million\n\nWhy the school paid so much: Arkansas was in a tough spot after firing Bret Bielema in 2017. After Gus Malzahn rebuffed a big-money offer to stay at Auburn, Arkansas was pretty far down the list of desirable jobs in a year with a lot of coaching changes. Not only did that limit Arkansas\u2019 pool of candidates but it created leverage for someone like Morris, who was making a little more than $2 million a year at SMU and didn't necessarily need to take on a major rebuilding job in the SEC unless he was going to get a huge bump in pay.\n\nWhy it\u2019s a bad contract: Plucking a successful coach from a Group of Five program is always a bit of a gamble for a Power Five school because you just don\u2019t know if it will translate. But in Morris\u2019 case, he hadn\u2019t even been particularly successful at SMU with a 14-22 overall record. Though in fairness the team had improved each year, going 7-5 in his final season there, Morris\u2019 reputation was largely formed due to his work as Clemson\u2019s offensive coordinator. So far, though, it\u2019s been a debacle at Arkansas as he\u2019s 0-12 in the SEC (4-15 overall), has yet to beat a Power Five team and has lost to the likes of North Texas, Colorado State and San Jose State.", "description": "Breaking down college football's most questionable coaches contracts, from mainstays (Kirk Ferentz) to newcomers (Chad Morris).", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published A.M.
