It also demonstrates renewed attention on the left to the federal judiciary, an area where many Democrats feel they've lost to Republicans.\n\n\u201cI personally would prefer that they didn\u2019t\u201d go after Coons, said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii,) whom Demand Justice has praised for voting against Trump judges.\n\nBut Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice and an alumnus of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, isn\u2019t apologizing and said the group is just getting started.\n\n\u201cWe plan to invest in Delaware a lot more heavily in the coming months, assuming Chris Coons continues voting for Trump judges,\u201d said Fallon, who was once a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cIf that\u2019s a record he\u2019s proud of and feels like he can defend then he has nothing to worry about from our ads.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Demand Justice, Coons responded, \u201cI\u2019ve got other stuff to worry about.\u201d\n\nDemand Justice\u2019s message on judges is simple: Democrats should reject all Trump\u2019s judges. Fallon argues that Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial nominees and that Democrats should take a page from their playbook. Like the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, Demand Justice uses ads to pressure Democratic senators on their voting records.\n\n\u201cWe think that the idea of doing horse trading with this administration is not worth it,\u201d Fallon said. \u201dIt is not worth it to let two bad Federalist Society judges through in exchange for getting somebody that is a buddy of one of these Democratic senators.\u201d\n\n\"The idea of doing horse trading with this administration is not worth it.\" - Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice.\n\nBut some senators say Demand Justice\u2019s hard line on judges isn\u2019t productive and insist that their caucus members are not the problem. They also argue that there\u2019s not a lot Democrats can do to block judicial appointments when they\u2019re in the minority.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re shining a spotlight on the judicial conveyor belt that the Republican donors are running right now that is a very worthy purpose,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said. But, he added, \u201cexpecting senators to vote against Trump appointees they have recommended to the president stretches at a bit much and is a targeting error.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing half the job,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii.) said. \u201cOne part of the job is to exert pressure on Democrats to do more, but you\u2019ve got to do the hard work of organizing the constituency behind it. ... They scratch a political itch but it doesn\u2019t solve the structural problem of us not having enough votes.\u201d\n\nFallon argues that Demand Justice is working at the grassroots level \u2014 with activists going to presidential candidate town halls and the New Hampshire State Party Convention. The group, Fallon says, wants Democrats to make the federal judiciary a top issue.\n\nSome Democratic senators recognize the value of fighting against Trump judges. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), another member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said \u201cfull-throated and vigorous advocacy is a good thing,\u201d while Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said the more attention the group brings to \u201cyoung right wing judges,\u201d the better for Democrats.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he likes Fallon and that Demand Justice provides senators \u201cvery good data\u201d about the quality of the Trump judicial nominees, while Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement she takes \u201cinput from all groups seriously\u201d and \u201cwill continue to do so.\u201d\n\nDemand Justice has also made a point to highlight the records of 2020 presidential candidates and judges, thanking those who they agree with but harshly judging those they don\u2019t. Demand Justice gave Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) an \u201cF\u201d for their votes in support of Trump judicial nominees in the previous Congress. Demand Justice even took out ads against Bennet. Asked recently about Demand Justice, Bennet said, \u201cI don\u2019t think about them.\u201d\n\nSens. Mazie Hirono, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris have all been praised by Demand Justice for their voting records on Trump-appointed judges. | Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThe group also bought digital ads earlier this year praising Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) for their pledges to oppose all Trump appellate nominees. Demand Justice also tracks the voting records for Democratic senators and has noted that in this current session of Congress, Democrats are voting less frequently for Trump judicial nominees compared with the previous Congress.\n\nIn addition to its campaign for Democrats to vote against Trump nominees, Demand Justice has pushed to expand the Supreme Court and was at the forefront of the fight against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the high court. Since the Kavanaugh vote, Demand Justice has also taken out ads against Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is up for re-election in 2020 and was a critical vote for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cYou have seen the rise on the fringes, on the far left and the far right, of outside third party groups that are increasingly controlling the debate and that are diminishing, ironically, the role of the parties,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI mean look at, I hate to show that I know his name, but look at Brian Fallon from Demand Justice and how he went after Democrats who were thinking of voting for Brett Kavanaugh.\u201d\n\nKaine said the pressure to vote \u201cno\u201d on Kavanaugh right away from liberal judicial groups isn't always effective and that many senators don\u2019t like to feel forced into voting for someone.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a strategy to muscle you better understand the people enough to know that it\u2019ll work,\u201d Kaine said. On Collins, he said, \u201cthere was an opening possibly \u2014 possibly \u2014 to get her vote but you\u2019re not going to get it by muscle tactics. You\u2019ll guarantee she\u2019ll vote the other way.\u201d\n\nBut Fallon isn\u2019t fazed by the criticism.\n\n\u201cI hope that they\u2019re thinking about us,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cI hope that they\u2019re thinking about us in the cloakroom. I hope they\u2019re thinking about us in the well of the Senate when they\u2019re voting.\u201d\n\nBurgess Everett contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Brian Fallon", "Executive Director Of Demand Justice."], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f1/8f/980826a647e4a6baee7bd15bae49/191001-chris-coons-gty-773.jpg"}
