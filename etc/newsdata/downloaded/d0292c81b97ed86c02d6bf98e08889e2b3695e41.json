Elizabeth Warren refused to answer a question from late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday about whether she\u2019ll raise taxes on the middle class in order to fund her \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan.\n\n\u201cHow are you going to pay for it? Are you going to raise the middle-class taxes?\u201d Mr. Colbert asked the Massachusetts senator on \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do this,\u201d Ms. Warren began. \u201cCosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTaxes, which is what you mean by \u2018costs?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Colbert interjected.\n\n\u201cYes, and hardworking middle-class families are going to see their costs go down,\u201d Ms. Warren said.\n\n\u201cBut will their taxes go up?\u201d Mr. Colbert asked.\n\n\u201cWell, but here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Ms. Warren said, ignoring the question.\n\n\u201cNo, but here\u2019s the thing,\u201d Mr. Colbert fired back. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to these answers a few times before, and I just want to make a parallel suggestion for you about how you might defend the taxes that perhaps you\u2019re not mentioning in your sentence.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Medicare for All like public school?\u201d the liberal host continued. \u201cThere might be taxes for it, but you certainly save money sending your kids to school, and do you want to live in a world where your kids aren\u2019t educated? Do you want to live in a world where your fellow citizens are dying even if it costs a little bit of money?\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept your point and I believe in your point,\u201d Ms. Warren responded before launching into her campaign pitch that \u201cnobody has to go bankrupt over health care if we get Medicare for All.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth care is a basic human right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fight for basic human rights, and that\u2019s Medicare for All. Everyone gets covered.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren has declined to say outright whether she will raise taxes on the middle class if she\u2019s elected president, in contrast to presidential candidate Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who has admitted he would have to in order to pay for his Medicare for All plan.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
