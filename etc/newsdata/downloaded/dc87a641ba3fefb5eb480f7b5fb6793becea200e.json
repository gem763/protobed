This seemed to rile up Bill O\u2019Reilly:\n\nBeto says he met a woman working FOUR jobs. And raising a special needs child. I don\u2019t believe him. Sorry. \u2014 Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 16, 2019\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for O\u2019Rourke\u2019s digital director to fire back:\n\nI was there. Her name was Gina. Her daughter is named Summer. Here's their picture.\n\n\n\nAsshole.https://t.co/Mbo8mnYTLE pic.twitter.com/jozvEMECwP \u2014 Rob Flaherty (@Rob_Flaherty) October 16, 2019\n\nAnd then O\u2019Rourke himself:\n\nThis is her. Her name is Gina. Her daughter's name is Summer. The problem with our economy is she has to live in her car\u2014while a disgraced TV host like you makes millions. https://t.co/J1Scsu3GJ5 pic.twitter.com/W1shXxVyeg \u2014 Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) October 16, 2019\n\nFrom there, the interaction took on a Twitter TWTR, -0.92% life of its own, with the internet dragging O\u2019Reilly over his history of sexual assault allegations and subsequent settlements that led to his leaving Fox News in 2017 as well as for his being detached from the real world and real financial problems.\n\nNot every woman has a huge sexual-harassment settlement in the bank. \u2014 Dave Hogg (@stareagle) October 16, 2019\n\nYou are a great one to be calling out what to believe. \u201c$32 million to just a single *one* of your harassees because you were innocent.\u201d\n\n\n\nTell us about that, mr. \u2018I don\u2019t believe a woman, especially a mother\u201d... \u2014 James Doyle (@priusjames) October 16, 2019\n\nQuiet, everybody!
