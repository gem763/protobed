Most companies and organizations have strict rules governing laptops and phones to prevent their data and intellectual property from being stolen or otherwise compromised. Often, they involve a list of countries to which burner devices are encouraged or required.\n\nCorporate espionage is an enormous problem \u2014 especially when it\u2019s done by other countries. Often, that country is China, and the theft of intellectual property is a major grievance in the current trade war. According to a CNBC survey of CFOs in March, one in five North American companies claim to have had their intellectual property stolen within the past year.\n\nChina isn\u2019t the only source of trouble, however. There are many countries that engage in corporate cyber espionage \u2013 but rather than just simply avoiding travel to countries on the \u201chigh-risk\u201d list, cybersecurity professionals would rather you change how you think about your security.\n\nThe right way to think about security\n\nThe most important thing to do before travel is to think about yourself and your own risk profile, cybersecurity experts Alex Hamerstone of TrustedSec and Michael Rohrs, head of the cyber consulting practice in the Americas for Control Risks told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cWhat do I have that someone else might want?\u201d is the question that Hamerstone advises people to think about first. \u201cThe fact of the matter is a lot of surveillance can be automated, but as far as truly targeting someone, they can't target every single traveler,\u201d he said. In other words, a corporate traveler presents a much different risk profile than someone on vacation.\n\nUsually. Sometimes, it\u2019s a little more nuanced \u2014 you may not realize that you could be a target. For example, if you work for a large company, it might have some sort of intellectual property worth taking. Even if you don\u2019t work on something sensitive, one compromised device \u2013 your company-issued laptop or smartphone \u2013 can be enough to get a cyber foot in the door.\n\nUnderstanding the country you\u2019re going to is key. If you work for a tech company, you might want to be careful going to certain countries with records of IP theft or espionage.\n\nHamerstone says that a great guideline to follow is: you can't lose what you don't have. \u201cYou don't want to travel with devices loaded with information. Don\u2019t take your everyday computer; take something different,\u201d he said. \u201cSome companies have loaner laptops specifically hardened to go overseas.\u201d\n\nThe FBI has a list of \u201ccritical information\u201d that it recommends people avoid bringing with them: Customer data, employee data, vendor information, pricing strategies, proprietary formulas and processes, technical components and plans, corporate strategies, corporate financial data, phone directories, computer access protocols, computer network design, acquisition strategies, marketing strategies, investment data, negotiation strategies, passwords.\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to take a loaner device, you can always make a backup and remove things. And since phones can be had for cheap, it\u2019s often worth getting a burner. And if you can use a VPN, which extends a private network to a public one, you should.\n\nImportant things to consider\n\nCybersecurity experts first advise people to find out the laws in the place they\u2019re going to. Certain countries ban bringing encrypted devices in and out of the country or to specific countries. This can even include the U.S., as \u201cexporting\u201d an encrypted device to certain places could be a violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn other countries, tools like encryption and VPNs may be illegal or regulated and could result in harassment from the government in countries like Belarus, Burma, China, Hungary, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Morocco, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Ukraine, according to Texas State University. Even possessing a device that is encrypted poses a travel risk.\n\nOne cybersecurity expert said that being detained at the border for no other reason than that would be a \u201cself-inflicted wound.\u201d\n\nSome countries are known to systematically monitor all information, like China, Russia, and Belarus. China is especially not shy about mentioning that it systematically monitors communications.", "description": "Many IT departments suggest not bringing devices with sensitive personal or corporate information to certain countries.", "authors": ["Ethan Wolff-Mann", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ut9ePYuC_q4v2R6Lr32_OA--~B/aD0zMzkwO3c9NTEyNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/89f99910-f763-11e9-b9fe-a291dee98838", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
