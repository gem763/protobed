A second reactor at the other Czech nuclear plant, Temelin, could follow.\n\nCEZ had canceled a previous tender to build a new unit at the existing Temelin plant in 2014 after the previous government refused to provide state guarantees.\n\nNo decision on a supplier is expected until after the next election in 2021.\n\nSix firms have shown interest in building the next unit - Korea\u2019s KHNP, Russia\u2019s Rosatom, France\u2019s EdF, Westinghouse of the United States, the Atmea consortium of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and EdF, which has been taken over by EdF, and China\u2019s CGN.\n\nCEZ has said it plans to phase out its coal-fired power plants by 2040 when only its newest lignite power station would remain operational.", "description": "The Czech Republic will have to build new nuclear power plants to replace aging coal and nuclear capacity even if they are in breach of European law, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441485392&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F14G", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
