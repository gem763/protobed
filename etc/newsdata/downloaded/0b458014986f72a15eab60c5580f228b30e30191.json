Third Spider-Man Film to be Produced by Marvel Set to Hit Theaters in 2021", "language": "en", "text": "Not all goodbyes are permanent.\n\nSony Pictures announced a third Spider-Man film will be produced by Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios after all, weeks after the two powerhouse studios couldn\u2019t reach an agreement for Tom Holland\u2019s fan-favorite superhero to remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie is set to hit theaters in 2021, with Marvel president Kevin Feige once again stepping in as producer.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that Spidey\u2019s journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it,\u201d Feige said in a statement. \u201cSpider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe. He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Tom Holland Opens Up About Spider-Man\u2019s Future in Wake of Disney-Sony Rift: It \u2018Will Be Different\u2019\n\nLast month, news broke that Disney would be ending its partnership with Sony Pictures on the Spider-Man franchise, thanks to a disagreement over co-financing. Sony owns the film rights to the iconic superhero, and several years ago, the studios struck a deal: Feige would help produce Sony\u2019s solo Spider-Man films, allowing Holland\u2019s Spidey to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War.\n\nView photos Tom Holland in Spider-Man: Far From Home | Columbia Pictures More\n\nAfter the release of this summer\u2019s Spider-Man: Far From Home (which has now become Sony\u2019s highest-grossing film of all time with $1.11 billion worldwide), Disney reportedly asked to share co-financing on future Spider-Man solo films, while Sony wanted the financing arrangement to remain the same as it had been.\n\nThe news about Spider-Man\u2019s return is sure to please both fans and its star alike. Holland stopped by PEOPLE and Entertainment Weekly\u2019s studio backstage at Disney\u2019s D23 last month, where he addressed the news of the initial split and reminisced about his time working with Marvel.\n\n\u201cBasically, we\u2019ve made five great movies,\u201d Holland told EW. \u201cIt\u2019s been five amazing years. I\u2019ve had the time of my life. Who knows what the future holds? But all I know is that I\u2019m going to continue playing Spider-Man and having the time of my life. It\u2019s going to be so fun, however we choose to do it. The future for Spider-Man will be different, but it will be equally as awesome and amazing, and we\u2019ll find new ways to make it even cooler.\u201d", "description": "Spidey's Back!
