Jacklyn said viewers would just have to get used to her weight gain\n\nHurt: 'The constant comments about my weight, it doesn\u2019t stop,' she continued in her 26-minute long video. 'Why is it all a sudden OK to call someone fat?'\n\nShe went on to share how some of her dedicated subscribers \u2014 the influencer boasts boasts 5.89 million followers on YouTube alone \u2014 expressed how they miss the 'old Jaclyn' in recent months.\n\n'There is no old Jaclyn and there is no new Jaclyn. This is who I am. I was born, and I am going to grow, and I am going to evolve for the rest of my life until I die,' she said.\n\n'I know you guys want that thin girl who\u2019s super peppy and loved life and was silly and joking all the time and did tutorials because she loved it so much. But you guys, I am seriously that same girl inside.'\n\nIn recent months, more and more commenters have bombarded Jaclyn with messages saying she isn't the same and that she is gaining weight.\n\nThis inspired Jaclyn to candidly address all of the comments on YouTube to potentially stop some of the hate.\n\n'The constant comments about my weight, it doesn\u2019t stop,' she continued in her 26-minute long video.\n\n'Why is it all a sudden OK to call someone fat? Like where did this come from? I can\u2019t gain a few pounds without the internet calling me fat. You think I look bad?

You guys need to accept it. You guys need to accept that I\u2019ve gained weight,' she added.\n\nNot only did Jaclyn address the weight gain comments, but she also slapped down anyone who thought she got cheek fillers in recent months. Jaclyn did this by explaining that the only filler she currently has is in her lips, but she has not put filler in her cheeks 'in the last three years'.\n\nThe video then ended with YouTuber imploring her followers to be kinder to everyone online.\n\n'Just be kind and accept people for who they are. Being kind, being compassionate,' she said.\n\nIn August, the influencer addressed her recent weight gain after receiving a number of comments online from followers.\n\nTransparent: In August, Jaclyn (pictured with her boyfriend) told followers she recently gained 20 lbs. making her 'insecure'\n\nStressful: 'Sweatpants are literally the only thing that fits me right now & ive had to go up 2 sizes in my jeans,' Jaclyn wrote at the time while sharing pictures with her boyfriend\n\n'Deal with it': Jaclyn, pictured right in January and left in July 2018, told her followers in August to expect her to look 'bigger' in videos\n\n'I have gained 20 pounds in the last 7 weeks,' Jaclyn wrote while sharing two pictures of herself in sweatpants with her boyfriend.\n\n'I'm being transparent with you guys, because I have been getting lots of comments about my weight. I have never been this insecure about my physical appearance in my life,' she continued.\n\n'Sweatpants are literally the only thing that fits me right now & ive had to go up 2 sizes in my jeans. But this guy still tells me how beautiful I am every single day & still picks me up and makes me feel like the most special girl in the world.\n\n'He speaks to my heart everyday & I genuinely believe God himself blessed me with him. He\u2019s a special one.'\n\nJaclyn faced backlash earlier this year after the failed launch of her lipstick collection due to product defects. At the time, customers expressed disappointment on social media from the lipstick they received from Jaclyn Cosmetics.\n\nIt was decided to pull the entire line and issue refunds to all customers. Whether Jaclyn will launch an updated line or a different product entirely remains to be seen.\n\nBut the controversy inspired her to take a break from social media and instead focus on her relationships.\n\nJaclyn's return to social media is when she first started to experience more shameful comments regarding her figure and the appearance of her face.", "description": "Jaclyn, 29, shared a lengthy YouTube video commenting on her weight gain.
