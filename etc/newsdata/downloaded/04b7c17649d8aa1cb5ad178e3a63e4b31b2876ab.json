The reticence of the two largest index fund providers to back these proposals draws criticism from some investors and climate activists.\n\nBlackRock sometimes criticizes the quality of the climate-change proposals offered by others, but the world\u2019s largest money manager and its top rivals have not put forward any proposals of their own since at least 2001, according to research firm FactSet.\n\n\u201cThe investors who should be the leaders have so far been the laggards,\u201d said Rob Berridge, director of shareholder engagement at Ceres, a Boston-based research and advocacy group focused on sustainability issues.\n\nTheir limited support for other shareholders\u2019 climate-related proposals highlights a broader pattern of deference to management at the companies in their stock portfolios, according to a Reuters analysis of their proxy voting records.\n\nAhead of shareholder meetings in 2017, investors led by Walden Asset Management filed resolutions with Blackrock and Vanguard calling for reviews of their proxy voting related to climate change. Walden later withdrew the resolutions after BlackRock and Vanguard each pledged to put a new focus on climate risks.\n\nBut in 2018, BlackRock and Vanguard only backed 10% and 12%, respectively, of climate-related shareholder resolutions, according to a count by Ceres. A Reuters review of proxy voting disclosures for the 2019 proxy season ended June 30 found similar rates of support by each manager for key votes tracked by Ceres this year.\n\nThose rates were less than Walden and other investors expected given the companies\u2019 pledges to take the issue more seriously, said Tim Smith, a director at the firm now known as Boston Trust Walden, a money manager focused on environmental and social issues.\n\nThe top index fund firms say they prefer to address issues they have with portfolio companies, including those related to climate change, in private talks with executives rather than through shareholder votes. Vanguard governance chief Glenn Booraem said such votes don\u2019t tell the whole story of its advocacy on climate issues. In an August report, Vanguard said it had met often with companies in carbon-intensive industries over the past year and discussed issues such as environmental risks and their impact on shareholder value.\n\nVanguard and BlackRock both declined to discuss their votes on specific proxy measures. They note their own investors hold a wide range of opinions on climate change.\n\nBlackRock told a large Seattle pension plan client in 2018 that it often finds shareholder proposals too prescriptive, immaterial or in the domain of a company\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cWe typically aim to understand the companies rather than use our vote as a blunt binary instrument,\u201d BlackRock said in response to due diligence questions from the Seattle City Employees\u2019 Retirement System (SCERS).\n\nThe third largest index fund manager, State Street Corp, supported the resolutions tracked by Ceres 34% of the time in 2018. The rate was about three times as often as its big index fund rivals and similar to the support rate of other big investors such as Charles Schwab Corp and Franklin Templeton, part of Franklin Resources Inc.\n\nState Street spokeswoman Olivia Offner declined to discuss individual votes but said in a statement that companies have responded to its concerns on issues including \u201cimproved disclosure on their sustainability practices.\u201d\n\nSome clients say BlackRock and Vanguard effectively press their concerns privately. They also cite efforts like the annual letter that BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink sends to other CEOs, in which he has raised topics including how environmental and social issues affect corporate valuations.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement, but they\u2019re taking it seriously and doing a much more proactive job\u201d of pressuring companies on climate and other issues, said Vermont Chief Investment Officer Eric Henry, speaking about top index fund firms. He oversees about $4.5 billion, including assets managed by BlackRock.\n\nWalden\u2019s Smith acknowledged that private pressure can work but said the major index funds need to vote critically to reinforce their message.\n\n\u201cThe problem is we have no insight into what\u2019s said in those meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether they soft-pedal it.\u201d\n\nIn late 2016, the $3 billion SCERS pension publicly rebuked BlackRock - which managed about $350 million of the system\u2019s investments - for its \u201creticence to oppose management, limited focus on environmental and social issues, inconsistency between their proxy voting record with their policies and public pronouncements and limited transparency on investment stewardship activities,\u201d as an official put it at a board meeting.\n\nOfficials at the plan put BlackRock on watch status, which could have led to it being dropped as an investment manager. Two years later, in December 2018, the Seattle system ended its review and kept its money with Blackrock, with a staff memo noting among other things the asset manager had voted to support a few climate risk resolutions in 2017 and 2018. Of 25 climate risk shareholder proposals in the 2018 proxy year, the company voted in favor of two, BlackRock told the Seattle retirement system in a letter reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe Seattle system\u2019s staff also noted that BlackRock had started providing some details on its engagements with companies behind closed doors. \u201cYet to assess the efficacy of these engagements, BlackRock must continue to increase its transparency,\u201d the memo states.\n\nCeres found that other big mutual fund companies have backed climate-related shareholder proposals at much higher rates. AllianceBernstein Holding LP and Eaton Vance Corp, for instance, supported climate-related proposals 88 percent and 85 percent of the time, respectively.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People wade through a flooded street after Hurricane Barry in Mandeville, Louisiana, U.S. July 13, 2019.

The report followed California utility PG&E Corp\u2019s declaration of bankruptcy in January, after its market value plummeted as the company\u2019s equipment was blamed for wildfires in California.", "description": "The far-reaching impacts of climate change on companies have investors pressing corporate leaders for action to minimize environmental damage and to maximize disclosure of risks to their businesses.
