Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be looking for from the seven candidates with the best chances of winning the nomination:\n\nElizabeth Warren. Swing voters exist, and they are likely to decide the 2020 election, much as they played a decisive role in 2016 and 2018. So far, Warren has not worried much about appealing to them. Now that she\u2019s the front-runner, can she begin to signal to Democrats that she wants to be ruthless about beating President Trump?\n\nJoe Biden. He has yet to seem sharp for an entire debate. Can he break that streak and alleviate concerns about his ability to withstand a long, vicious campaign? I\u2019m more interested in that than the narrow questions of how he responds to Trump\u2019s false smears against his family.\n\nCory Booker, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. They are the best-positioned candidates to benefit from Biden\u2019s uneven campaign and win over more moderate Democrats. Can any of the three make an explicit case: I\u2019m stronger than Biden and more electable than Warren?", "description": "Debate night: What I\u2019ll be watching for.", "authors": ["David Leonhardt"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/opinion/15leonhardt-newsletter/15leonhardt-newsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
