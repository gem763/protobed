As a season-long employee of Ibiza\u2019s most dazzling party of the decade, she has learned to set some ground rules. Long beards are a no-no, they use up too much product. And she recoils in mock horror at the thought of getting stuck into a hairy chest. \u201cBut girl\u2019s chests are fine\u201d she says.\n\nAnything goes at Glitterbox, within reason. Birthed in Ibiza in 2014 and currently held at the superclub H\u00ef, the weekly house and disco night aims to distil the ephemeral hedonism of classic disco nights, such as New York\u2019s Paradise Garage, with a little of Mudd Club\u2019s scuffed-up edge, diverse bookings and a rotating phalanx of resplendent LGBTQ+ dancers. That\u2019s a bold approach in Ibiza, the global epicentre for commercial dance that\u2019s still dominated by older male DJs such as Carl Cox, Martin Garrix and, sadly, David Guetta, with his excruciatingly titled party Fuck Me I\u2019m Famous. But the ethos is working for Glitterbox: punters pack out H\u00ef\u2019s 5,500 capacity every Sunday in the summer, and the night also hosts one-off events at London\u2019s Ministry of Sound and New York\u2019s House of Yes.\n\nGlitterbox\u2019s ultra-inclusive policy to unite \u201call ages, persuasions and walks of life on the dancefloor\u201d is made flesh by the dazzling dancers, who clamber onto podiums to create focal points across the club\u2019s three dancefloors (including one with a DJ booth in the unisex loos). The performers include shirtless hunk Raven, the Shirley-Temple-on-acid drag of TeTe Bang, and Lucy Fizz, a transgender dancer whose vivacious attitude and turbocharged moves have made her Glitterbox\u2019s most beloved regular. After an uplifting set from Joey Negro, the ensemble swarm onto podiums to dance behind Honey Dijon as she whips between disco-house rarities and unexpected pop moments such as Lizzo\u2019s body-positive hit Juice. As they flank tonight\u2019s other DJs \u2013 Todd Terry, DJ Harvey, Nightmares on Wax and more \u2013 the performers can make you feel as if you\u2019re in a mad immersive theatre production; as if Punchdrunk did nightclubs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest You feel as if you\u2019re in a mad immersive theatre production ... the crowd at Glitterbox. Photograph: Mario Pinta/Glitterbox\n\nWhen Glitterbox was founded five years ago, it was a welcome respite from the electronic dance music and techno nights that dominated the island\u2019s nightlife. \u201cI remember going to Ibiza in 1986 and 1988 and the dancefloors had real personality,\u201d says Simon Dunmore, Glitterbox\u2019s driving force and the founder of house label, Defected. \u201cIt was real hedonism, and there were real fashionista personalities. We wanted to bring that back.\u201d After a few disastrous first nights (Dunmore blames a clash with that summer\u2019s World Cup games), Glitterbox was getting 1,200 people through its doors by September. That number has grown, summer-on-summer, since then.\n\nIbiza has over a dozen gay bars in its Old Town, but it\u2019s still trying to shake the reputation that one friend described to me as \u201caggressively heterosexual.\u201d Glitterbox seems like the closest thing to a queer party here, but given that the island is a majority-straight destination, LGBTQ+ clubbers, such as myself, are a minority at the night itself. As it reaches its 3am apex, I find myself surrounded by tanned English twentysomethings in floral prints and shimmery mesh outfits and briefly wonder if I have been teleported to Love Island\u2019s Casa Amor. Hearteningly, I spot a group of gay guys on the dancefloor, but it\u2019s an odd sensation to be the only person singing along to Madonna\u2019s Vogue.\n\n\u201cYeah, it is predominantly heteronormative,\u201d says trans DJ and producer Dijon, speaking about Ibiza nightlife in general. \u201cBut there are a lot of queer people here. They\u2019re just more interspersed throughout the parties. I think it\u2019s great that they can come and feel comfortable in these spaces that aren\u2019t specifically queer.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One for the fans ...

At the night\u2019s fun pre-party at Cafe Mambo, I chat to Reece Le Beau, a 21-year-old dancer with a flawlessly beat face. He has performed at gay parties at London\u2019s Heaven and Metropolis, but says they \u201cdon\u2019t compare\u201d to Glitterbox. He becomes tongue-tied when trying to find the words for the night\u2019s particular magic. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel special.\u201d\n\nFizz, clad in some kind of Bob-Mackie-for-Cher-esque fabulosity, jumps in. \u201cAs a trans woman, I really understand the importance of having dedicated LGBTQ+ spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s so much more wealth to be added to nightlife when everyone comes together and celebrates the music.\u201d And as for the island\u2019s lads-lads-lads reputation? Undeserved. \u201cI grew up with all those Ibiza Uncovered-type programmes,\u201d says Fizz. \u201cIt put me off. Then I came with Glitterbox and I\u2019ve seen this other side of the island. I feel more comfortable going out to the straight nights here than I do in London. I see less fights, less dickhead laddish behaviour.\u201d\n\nDunmore says that Glitterbox\u2019s accepting vibe is largely self-regulated. \u201cI think everyone who\u2019s not comfortable with us being LGBTQ+ friendly probably isn\u2019t going to come,\u201d he says drily. But the evening doesn\u2019t come cheap. Entry is an eye-watering \u20ac50, or \u20ac40 for an early entry ticket. Gin and tonics \u2013 they only serve doubles \u2013 are a hefty \u20ac18. No wonder so many people are clutching water bottles and chewing gum.\n\nIt\u2019s undeniably a good thing to make all clubbing a little less heteronormative, as well as to remind audiences \u2013 including LGBTQ+ fans \u2013 that dance music\u2019s roots are queer, black, and Latinx. But Glitterbox illuminates tension between those who are rightly protective of LGBTQ+ spaces and culture, and those who celebrate when boundaries between gay and straight nightlife are weakened. On the night, it felt a bit like a gay night for straight people. I asked Dijon what she thought, as a more seasoned clubber. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re trying to introduce queer music to a straight audience,\u201d she replied. \u201cI think they\u2019re just reflecting the way that house music has always been. Having dancers, vibrancy, and drag artists \u2013 this has always been a part of dance music culture.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Dancers, vibrancy, and drag artists \u2013 this has always been a part of dance music culture\u2019 ...

Photograph: Mario Pinta/Glitterbox\n\nAs a straight man, Dunmore seems to be hyperaware of charges of \u201cpinkwashing\u201d, the cynical kind of corporate money-grubbing that perhaps reached its nadir during Pride month this year with Listerine\u2019s rainbow-packaged mouthwash. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the community has been very vocal about corporations tagging LGBTQ+ on everything and using it gratuitously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want to do that, or use that as a marketing angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it necessarily needs to hold up a flag,\u201d says Dijon, speaking of Glitterbox branding itself as inclusive. \u201cIf you look at the flyers for their parties [showing] women of colour and queer people ... it just speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nAs I leave I think back to Reece. On the dancefloor he seemed nothing like the shy kid that couldn\u2019t find his words. The crowd parted as he strutted bare-assed in a neon body harness and spiked boots, and smiled wide while dancing with hands aloft as confetti fell. Through the haze of a half-dozen gin and tonics, I tried to think of when I last saw someone who looked so free.\n\nFive key Glitterbox tracks, chosen by Simon Dunmore\n\nDebbie Jacobs \u2013 Don\u2019t You Want My Love (Remastered)\n\n\u201cIt was never a commercially successful disco record but it had high energy and was a turntable hit [on its original release in 1979]. It rocked discerning dancefloors. It\u2019s a real clubbers\u2019 anthem with an amazing vocal.\u201d\n\nHorse Meat Disco and Kathy Sledge \u2013 Falling Deep in Love\n\n\u201cHorse Meat Disco have DJ\u2019d with us from the get-go. We actually got in touch with Kathy Sledge [of Sister Sledge], we asked if she would record for us and she came over and co-wrote the song. I\u2019ve met her several times over the years, and she\u2019s performed three times for us this summer. She\u2019s very iconic, she\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nAeroplane featuring Tawatha Agee \u2013 Love On Hold (Dimitri from Paris DJ Friendly Re-Touch)\n\n\u201cThe vocalist Tawatha Agee was in a classic disco band called Mtume, and she\u2019s done backing vocals on a lot of the great disco records. Aeroplane delivered the record and Dimitri remixed it in a very authentic, almost Larry Levan-esque, Paradise Garage way, with lots of delays on the drums and breakdowns.\u201d\n\nFiorious \u2013 I\u2019m Not Defeated, Pt II (Honey Dijon\u2019s Undefeated Dub)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real statement, this record. I heard it when Cassius played it last summer and when I looked online, I saw this video that he\u2019d made. We contacted him and asked him to come and perform for us. He\u2019s an amazing performer. If you check the video, you\u2019ll understand what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nJKriv featuring Adeline \u2013 Yo Love\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just released this. It\u2019s a very 80s, electric, boogie disco record. I think that if that was a record that was released on Prelude and mixed by Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian or Shep Pettibone, no one would argue with that. It sounds really authentic. This is what we were trying to achieve when we started the Glitterbox label: we wanted to create contemporary disco records that were played on our dancefloors.\u201d", "description": "Despite dance music\u2019s roots in gay subculture, the island\u2019s superclubs are overwhelmingly straight.
