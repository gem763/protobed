Located at the centre of the scattered Greek Cyclades islands, its architecture, stellar nightlife and drifts of golden sand make it the envy of the archipelago. Days here are spent checking out different beach scenes, from family-friendly or water sports, to ultra-luxe beach clubs. At sunset, the focus falls firmly on Chora (Mykonos Town): a one-of-a-kind jumble of white, cube-shaped buildings connected by painted stone pathways. Follow them to find waterfront clubs, bars and restaurants, plus wonderful places to stay.\n\nHere is a selection of the best.\n\nThe Independent's hotel reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.

Guests (including familiar faces from entertainment and fashion) come here for its mix of tranquillity, style and see-and-be-seen pizazz.

Set right on the waterfront, the property combines Cycladic design with innovative style and subtle retro references. With excellent dining at The Plate and quality cocktails at the bar, staying here is a one-of-a-kind experience.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac233 (\u00a3212) per night, including breakfast\n\nmykonostheoxenia.com\n\nBest for style on a budget: Ostraco Hotel & Suites\n\nLocation: Mykonos Town\n\nHotel rates decline the further you get from the centre of Mykonos Town. Ostraco is an ideal example: located on a hillside within a short walk of the action, this funky retreat is considerably cheaper than similar-calibre hotels further down.

Its white, cuboid forms cascade down a hillside and contain 35 all-sea-view rooms, two restaurants and a spa. The peninsula on which the hotel is located is less developed than elsewhere on the island, and the pretty bay below it is pleasantly sheltered from strong summer winds.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac345 (\u00a3313) per night, including breakfast\n\nkatikies.com\n\nBest for plot-to-plate dining: Myconian Kyma Hotel\n\nNeighbourhood: Mykonos Town\n\nGastronomic greatness is guaranteed at Myconian Kyma, whose NOA Restaurant (new for 2019) goes large on Mediterranean flavours. Ingredients that have been grown, reared or fished right here in Mykonos are transformed into tasty sharing plates and served with sea or sunset views. The hotel itself is a gorgeous blend of Cycladic cubes, smooth cobblestones and contemporary style that strikes a finely-tuned balance between traditional and trendy.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac220 (\u00a3200) per night, including breakfast\n\nmyconiankyma.gr\n\nBest for budget beach breaks: Terra Maltese Natural Retreat\n\nNeighbourhood: Ftelia Beach\n\nFor more of an away-from-it-all feel, try Terra Maltese Natural Retreat. Surrounded by open countryside and within walking distance of Ftelia Beach (and a 10-minute drive from Mykonos Town), this laid-back resort calls to mind a traditional village of whitewashed cube homes. Its elevation and aspect ensure gorgeous sea views from all rooms and the restaurant terrace. The peaceful location is countered by convenient access by bus to Mykonos Town and elsewhere.\n\nDoubles from \u20ac60 (\u00a355) per night, including breakfast\n\nterramaltese.com\n\nBest for beachfront blowouts: Kensh\u014d Psarou\n\nNeighbourhood: Psarou Beach\n\nParty people descending on Psarou for its cosmopolitan beach scene now have somewhere suitably chic to stay in Kensh\u014d Psarou. Accommodation comes in the shape of 30 luxurious suites that blend Aegean architecture with local stone and aged wood. For those not kicking up their heels next door at Nammos (one of the island's best beach clubs), there's a spa on the beach, a poolside lounge and a seafood restaurant at the water's edge.\n\nSuites from \u20ac765 (\u00a3695) per night, including breakfast\n\nkenshomykonos.com\n\nBest for romantic escapes: Myconian Naia\n\nNeighbourhood: near Mykonos Town\n\nFor a combination of space, peace and proximity to Mykonos Town, hilltop Myconian Naia is hard to beat.
