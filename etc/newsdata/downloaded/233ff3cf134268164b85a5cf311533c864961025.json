Other members of the assembly, including the president, objected to the request. The far-right politicians, who belong to the National Rally party, stormed out. And in a moment captured by a picture that soon spread widely, the woman\u2019s son cried in her arms.\n\nShe has declined to speak to the news media, but the confrontation quickly gained national attention. Battle lines were swiftly drawn.\n\nOn one side, there are those who say the veil is a symbol, an archaic garment that has no place in France\u2019s secular republic. On the other are those who argue that veiled women are subjected to barely hidden racism and religious discrimination by people who refuse to accept French multiculturalism.\n\nIn an interview with the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, an advocacy group, the mother who went to Dijon said the incident had \u201cdestroyed her life.\u201d The mother also intends to file a legal complaint.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "A heated debate over France\u2019s values reignited across the country this week, the latest fight in a culture war that has raged for years in universities, the halls of government and even on the beach.
