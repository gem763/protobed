Jones, citing an internal poll at his macro hedge fund Tudor Investment Corp., also said economic growth in the U.S. would fall to 1% from estimates of more than 2% this year.\n\nWarren, who advocates for a 2% tax on America\u2019s richest families, \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and new regulations on private equity, is stoking fear on Wall Street as she\u2019s gained momentum in a huge field of candidates for the Democratic nomination. Macro hedge fund manager Citrone, who runs the $2.5 billion Discovery Capital Management, said last week that she could send the market down 10% and 20% if she\u2019s leading the way into the February primaries. Vinik, who rose to fame as the manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, told Bloomberg that if Warren\u2019s candidacy keeps gaining momentum, \u201cthe market is going to have a lot of agita\u201d -- which could be a buying opportunity.\n\nHer self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d opponent, Bernie Sanders, would cause the markets to tumble about 20%, Jones said. Warren\u2019s more centrist opponents for the nomination Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar would drag down the market by around 10%, he told the audience.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones said, the re-election of President Donald Trump would boost the S&P to 3,600 -- representing an 18% jump from the index\u2019s record high of 3,039 as of the end of trading Monday.\n\nThe veteran hedge fund manager, who added that he has no idea who will win the election and has no strong feeling on the market, is continuing to bet on gold, he told the audience. The former cotton trader told Bloomberg in June that gold was his favorite pick for the next 12 to 24 months, and prices for the precious metal have since jumped about 11%. He also said Monday that he expects another U.S. interest rate cut and some profit-taking to follow, then a market rally to finish the year.\n\nAt a gala last week, Jones, 65, raved about Democratic presidential candidate Buttigieg, saying of the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana: \u201cHe\u2019s my man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Pete, I love Mayor Pete, because I think he would be the best administrator to run this country, and he\u2019s got a compassionate heart,\u201d Jones, who has given to both Republicans and Democrats in the past, added at the gala. \u201cI\u2019m not politically active at all. But right now he\u2019s getting me excited.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Katia Porzecanski in New York at kporzecansk1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alan Mirabella at amirabella@bloomberg.net, Josh Friedman, Katherine Burton\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones joined hedge fund managers Rob Citrone and Jeff Vinik in warning that the stock market would tank over the prospect of an Elizabeth Warren presidency.The S&P 500 Index will drop about 25% if the Democratic senator wins the 2020 election, mostly because of concern", "authors": ["Katia Porzecanski"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
