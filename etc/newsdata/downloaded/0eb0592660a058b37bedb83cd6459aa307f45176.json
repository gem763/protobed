When lifting the coffin out it just fell to bits.\n\nDebbie Swales at the grave of her husband Gavin Swales (Picture: NCJ Media)\n\n\u2018Imagine that happening to your loved one. It is not private, 400 to 500 people were able to see him laid there.\u2019\n\nThe family had envisaged a dignified send-off in November 2015 for a man known as a \u2018gentle giant\u2019.\n\nHeartbroken Debbie and her family rearranged Gavin\u2019s funeral, which was held for a second time in two days, using a different funeral director.\n\nBut for the mother-of-eight the damage had already been done. The memory of her husband had been tarnished and it is something she says she can never forgive funeral director Clark Pearson for.\n\nShe said: \u2018When I saw Gavin he just didn\u2019t look the same. He had a cut across his face as a result of the coffin breaking. It has haunted me ever since.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t get on with living my life because I\u2019ve been grieving for so long.\n\n\u2018It is not just the fact they dropped him. Of course it was an accident.\n\n\u2018But who would run away? You would front up to what happened and not leave the family to jump into the grave.\u2019\n\nGavin Swales (centre), pictured with wife Debbie and brother Frankie in June 2015 (Picture: NCJ Media)\n\nGavin died after battling leukaemia and kidney cancer, an ordeal which started in 2013.\n\n.\n\nBrother Frankie stepped in to donate his bone marrow and Gavin\u2019s health started to improve. But the dad\u2019s progress was halted when he got pneumonia. Just months after undergoing a second transplant, Gavin died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebbie, who also has six grandchildren, has received counselling since the incident.\n\n\u2018The last four years have been hell,\u2019 Debbie said. \u2018Every time I see Gavin I just see the image of him in a broken coffin with people running around chaotically and family members being left to get him out.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t been to another funeral since, not even my best friend\u2019s.\n\n\u2018The kids can\u2019t go to Gavin\u2019s grave because they have flashbacks.\u2019\n\nIn August, the family reluctantly accepted a settlement of \u00a3136,500 with the funeral directors.\n\nBut a \u00a377,000 legal bill and other fees meant the Swales family ended up with around \u00a347,000.\n\nTo this day Debbie claims to have never received an apology from Clark Pearson, which is still operating in Newcastle.\n\nDebbie said: \u2018It means after all we\u2019ve been through me and my children have ended up with just over \u00a35,000 each. It\u2019s an absolute insult.\n\n\u2018All I\u2019ve wanted is justice for my husband. It has not, and never will be, about the money. But my family has been through hell the past four years and Clark Pearson needed to realise what they have done to us.\n\n\u2018People say that time heals, but I don\u2019t feel any different now to what I did on the day of his funeral. I feel empty and I just can\u2019t be happy. I am always going to be carrying this sadness around for the rest of my life.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewcastle City Council took no action against Clark Pearson for the incident. Instead, the authority confirmed they met with all funeral directors in the area to remind them of their roles and responsibilities as a result of the incident.\n\nA statement from Clark Pearson\u2019s solicitor said: \u2018Clark Pearson deeply regrets this unfortunate incident and the distress that was caused to the family.\n\n\u2018Settlement of the claims was agreed at mediation, so it would be inappropriate for Clark Pearson to comment any further.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
