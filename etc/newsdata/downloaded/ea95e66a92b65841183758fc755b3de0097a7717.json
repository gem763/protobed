It\u2019s definitely ignorant racism. I think there\u2019s blatant racism and then there\u2019s ignorant racism.\u2019\n\nBah then hinted that bosses were made aware of his complaint, but are yet to take any action.\n\nSouleyman Bah has accused The Apprentice bosses of ignoring racism (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018I think my beef isn\u2019t with the perpetrator per se; its more for what\u2019s been done about it. It seems that I\u2019m still waiting for the outcome,\u2019 he added.\n\nLottie has furiously denied being racist and the BBC have confirmed they will be looking into \u2018a complaint\u2019.\n\nHe continued: \u2018I am just happy that there\u2019s finally been a formal investigation into it.\n\n\u2018My main concern was that nothing was being done about it but I think it\u2019s good that the production company are looking into and will hopefully come to a conclusion.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t spoken to Lottie directly and to be honest I wouldn\u2019t want to either but I want to as much as I felt affected by it I wanted to pull myself away from it because it was quite negative and the show is supposed to be positive so I want to focus more on that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Apprentice airs Wednesdays at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
