There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters on Thursday .\n\nMulvaney\u2019s headline-generating performance during the 40-minute briefing seemingly landed him in hot water . He issued a statement five hours later walking back his comments and condemning the press for \u201cmisconstruing\u201d his words after he appeared to confirm, at least in part, the allegations of a quid pro quo that have landed Trump in the middle of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nMulvaney was widely criticized by GOP lawmakers and the president\u2019s confidants, including Fox News host Sean Hannity, who called Mulvaney\u2019s actions \u201cidiotic\u201d during his radio show Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhat is Mulvaney even talking about? I just think he\u2019s dumb, I really do. I don\u2019t even think he knows what he\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s my take on it,\u201d Hannity said to his listeners.\n\nYet the Trump campaign claimed ownership of the phrase, boldly displaying Mulvaney\u2019s comment in large white letters on a navy shirt with Trump\u2019s signature hairdo adorning the \u201co\u201d in \u201cover.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica is ready for Congress to get back to work,\u201d the product description reads. \u201cNo more WITCH HUNTS! President Trump won in 2016 and he is going to win even bigger in 2020. GET OVER IT and get on with it!\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/8c/d0/f4e074a646b2a3c60cb8f1940106/191018-mulvaney-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
