Plus, he also said he wanted to help people.\n\nFast forward to the present and his videos have been viewed over 68 million times collectively.\n\nHis decision to try his hand at being a virtual boyfriend was egged on by commentors on his popular uploads.\n\nAccording to DiscoverASMR.com, a lot of the ASMR Boyfriends out there can veer into the creepy territory, with kissing sounds and inappropriate compliments/affirmations.\n\nCaring: One of Riley's most popular video is his 'Boyfriend Cares For You While Sick' clip, which even involves him pretending to take your temperature\n\nWhispering: All of the 17-year-old's videos involve him whispering at an audible level\n\n'I thought I could do it in my own way,' he said. 'I come from a Christian background. I don't want to do anything that will affect my integrity, which is wholesome.'\n\nIn that vein, anything he creates, he makes sure it passes his own personal litmus test: would his mom approve?\n\nWHAT IS ASMR? Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is an enjoyable or relaxing sensation often accompanied by a 'tingly' feeling. A large online community claims ASMR clips on YouTube provoke a response likened to a warm tingling on the skin in some viewers. It is most commonly triggered by whispering, but can be brought about by an array of stimuli, including gentle touches, observing mundane tasks, and hearing crinkling/tapping sounds. The sensation typically begins at the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine, helping people to relax, relieve stress or sleep. Researchers say the feeling can be a response to specific sights, sounds, touch, smell, and other stimuli. ASMR may benefit people struggling with anxiety and depression, but there isn't any proven direct evidence yet, according to Dr Craig Richard of ASMR University, an online community devoted to researching the topic.\n\nSource: Psychology Today\n\n'I had a moment where I realized... I could do it in my own way, something more realistic and natural; for teenagers. I wanted to create something that my viewers won't be afraid to be caught watching.'\n\nAnd in fact, he actually takes inspiration from his own mom when it comes to some of his videos like 'Loving Boyfriend Does Your Makeup (Sleep-Inducing)' and 'Boyfriend Tucks You In At Night' - as well as the aforementioned 'Boyfriend Cares For You While Sick'.\n\n'I based it off my mom and how she would treat me,' he revealed. 'She would give me soda, crackers, you know, but then I changed into a boyfriend to make it sweeter.'\n\n'My family is so supportive,' he added, evidenced by the fact that his mom and sister often guest star in some of his videos.\n\n'They thought it was cool I could get that many subscribers from whispering into a microphone.\n\nUltimately, what has led to his channel becoming the most prominent of the genre is his own understanding of what viewers need.\n\n'I have dealt with the same things my viewers have: anxiety, insomnia and depression. And I've never been in a serious relationship, so I know how loneliness feels,' he said.\n\n'I know how it all feels, so I can help give them what they're lacking.'\n\nMom-approved: Riley- who is Christian - said his 'litmus test' for his content is whether or not his mom, pictured with him in a video, would approve\n\nNormal teen: As he is home-schooled, Riley was just looking for a way to entertain himself during down time, unaware that he would become a YouTube celebrity\n\nWith over 580,000 subscribers, Riley is evidently popular online.\n\nHowever, two experts warned the New York Times that young women becoming reliant on listening to this kind of content while they have trouble sleeping can quickly become 'problematic'.\n\nAlexandra R. Lash, a clinical psychologist, told the outlet that she had concerns that 'watching too much of this kind of role-play may cause an 'unrealistic and idealized perspective of what a partner can or should be.'\n\nDr Caroline Fleck, a clinical psychologist and an adjunct instructor at the Stanford University School of Medicine, agreed.\n\n'The subliminal message in these videos is that the viewer needs someone to take care of them in order to fall asleep, and that's a notion we try to fight against in mental health. Believing so interferes with your ability to take care of yourself,' she said.", "description": "Owen Dennis Riley, a home-schooled Christian student from outside Savannah, Georgia, turned to making ASMR videos while bored and somehow became a bona fide Internet celebrity.", "authors": ["Freya Drohan For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/18/19407456-0-image-a-204_1570470395716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
