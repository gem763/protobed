Sadly, on August 10, they were involved in a head on collision with another vehicle travelling on the wrong side of the road.\n\n\"The Mercedes didn't notice the Hyundai was slowing down or coming to a stop and took evasive action not knowing what was coming in the opposite direction.\n\n\"Tabitha sadly died at the scene and her mother was dead on arrival at hospital.\n\n\"We would offer our sincere condolences to the family for the sad lost in most tragic circumstances.\n\n\"This was a family on holiday, leaving the survivors of the crash without a mother and a sister.\n\n\"I will record they died as a result of a road traffic collision,\" the coroner said.", "description": "Louise Sword, 53, and her 12-year-old daughter Tabitha, were killed as they travelled back to their safari lodge in the Kwazulu-Natal Province", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20685854.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Sword.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
