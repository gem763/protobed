(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nPlanned Parenthood announced on Wednesday the launch of a $45 million ad campaign targeting key battleground states in the fight to defeat Trump and reclaim a majority in the Senate.\n\nThe organization\u2019s super PAC said the campaign will include advertisements in the mail, television, radio, and digital media, as well as grassroots initiatives.\n\nThe campaign will be especially focused in Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina, where Republican senators are up for election in 2020. Those races could decide which party holds a majority in the Senate.\n\nExecutive Director of Planned Parenthood Votes Kelley Robinson said in a statement that \u201cNext November, our very rights and freedoms will be on the ballot.\u201d\n\nThe campaign will also target voters in states crucial to President Trump\u2019s reelection, including Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has faced several setbacks over the past year. The organization left the federal family planning program in August, due to Trump\u2019s decision to enforce a ban on abortion referrals.\n\nSeveral states have also taken steps to curtail access to abortion providers, most notably Alabama, which outlawed almost all instances of abortion earlier this year. Successive rollbacks of abortion access led the organization to declare a \u201cstate of emergency.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court announced it would hear arguments in the case of a Louisiana law that requires the clinician who performs an abortion to have admitting privileges to a hospital within thirty minutes of the clinic.", "description": "The organization's super PAC said the campaign will include ads in the mail, television, radio, and digital media, as well as grassroots initiatives.", "authors": ["Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
