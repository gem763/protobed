The Nationals\u2019 finale against the Cleveland Indians meant nothing; they weren\u2019t playing for anything for the first time since spring training. They\u2019d secured their postseason spot early last week and home-field advantage in Tuesday\u2019s National League wild-card game the night before. They\u2019d won before they started.\n\nThe Nationals later won Sunday\u2019s actual game, 8-2, behind six strong innings from Joe Ross and a well-rounded offense, as the team looked laid-back throughout. After an abysmal start, a months-long slog back and a topsy-turvy final month, they embraced a moment of respite. Manager Dave Martinez started five regulars and joked about how he\u2019d constructed his lineup: \u201cClosed my eyes. Wrote names down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBox score: Nationals 8, Indians 2\n\nThe most intriguing puzzle piece, the Nationals\u2019 wild-card game opponent, finally fell into place later in the afternoon. The Milwaukee Brewers booked a trip to Washington after the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Cubs in Chicago and captured sole possession of the NL Central crown. This gave the Nationals clarity they\u2019ve lacked for weeks and allowed the team, and starter Max Scherzer, to focus.\n\nThe game\u2019s lack of stakes allowed the Nationals to use it as a sandbox. The regulars, Adam Eaton and Trea Turner, hit a couple times and departed. Two veteran role players, Matt Adams and Brian Dozier, started for tuneup innings. Two situational options for the wild-card game, Andrew Stevenson and Michael A. Taylor, subbed in for the same reason (Taylor later stole two bases). Ryan Zimmerman and Parra honed their pinch-hit routines. Victor Robles returned from two days off with an illness. Every pitcher who could possibly be important on Tuesday rested.\n\nAaron Barrett returned to the mound in Nationals Park for the first time since Aug. 5, 2015. The veteran right-hander was once a linchpin in the Nationals bullpen, but then his arm got sore and he couldn\u2019t feel his fingers. He underwent Tommy John surgery and, in rehab, snapped his arm while pitching. One teammate said it sounded like someone kicked in a piece of plywood. He spent two years out of baseball, two more climbing back through the minor leagues and, after following an intensive regiment this season with the Class AA Harrisburg Senators, made it back to the big leagues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe return didn\u2019t go exactly as he wanted \u2014 two hits, one walk, one run allowed \u2014 but he\u2019d done it. He walked off the field in tears to a standing ovation from the crowd and his teammates. His return gave this game meaning.\n\nKurt Suzuki might have missed three weeks with right-elbow inflammation, but the catcher started for the second time in three days since returning. He homered to left in the third inning in what ultimately gave the Nationals the lead for good. His arm wasn\u2019t tested, but he joked last week it hardly mattered; his performance earlier this season \u2014 when he caught five of 50 would-be base-stealers \u2014 proved it. He left after the fourth inning with a strong case to start Tuesday.\n\nJuan Soto emerged from his September slump in his first at-bat and blasted a run-scoring double off the scoreboard in right field. He came into the game 12 for his last 72 and, though Soto has said his first, full major league season is the most he\u2019s played in his life, Martinez expressed confidence in his young star. The manager said the 20-year-old hasn\u2019t pulled open out of his swing as much in the last few days.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back and ready to go,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hit fourth for us Tuesday and hopefully he\u2019s going to get the opportunity to drive in runs.\u201d\n\nAnd, now that the race was over, Martinez and his players could admit they wanted the home-field advantage. They\u2019d maintained all week they\u2019d like to stay in Washington, but it wasn\u2019t imperative. Now, though, Martinez acknowledged the little things do help, and though he wasn\u2019t stress-free \u2014 there was still a playoff roster to finalize, still an opponent to game-plan for \u2014 it helped that he wasn\u2019t also rushing for the airport. He\u2019d end the day by having dinner with his sons, who are in town.\n\n\u201cI hardly ever sleep,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut yeah, what I really like about today is I get to go home.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nThe 12 best moments from the Nationals\u2019 wild 2019 season\n\nMax Scherzer feels as strong as ever for wild-card start\n\nBaseball according to Gerardo Parra\n\nSvrluga: Ryan Zimmerman is at the end of his deal, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the Nats without him\n\nAD", "description": "In a game without stakes, Washington topped the Indians, 8-2, behind six strong innings from Joe Ross and a well-rounded offense.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CB8sAn1HKeQekzhmI0j0cLVdy44=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZH43R5XDAQI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
