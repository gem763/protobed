A giant's playground in the Cederberg\n\n\n\nIt has something for every palette and serves it to you on a silver platter. All you have to do is indulge in it. So rich in biodiversity, it is home to rare species of fynbos, marine life and has an 70km of coastline flanked by towering sand dunes. This is nature porn at its best. SEE: PICS: 90% of southern right whales are at De Hoop on the Overberg coastline right now 3. Skiing in Lesotho \u2013 an African winter wonderland A few hours drive from Joburg, through the golden Free State lies a snowy playground for couples, friends and, particularly families wishing to discover and experience an unexpected African winter wonderland, Afriski Mountain Resort.\n\nWe are not used to underfloor heating, log cabins, gl\u00fchwein, snowsuits and ski slopes. The altitude of 3 050m above sea level is also hard to breathe in. But it\u2019s magical. You'll have to plan carefully as when to take this escape.

For South Africans, it's not exactly the first place that springs to mind when they think of an island holiday. Its capital of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo will make you feel like you teleported back in time.\n\nClassic Portuguese architecture is prevalent throughout the city, which you can pretty much walk flat in just over an hour. Churches, houses, shops, pavement restaurants - all are painted in a flurry of colours as cars drive past on cobbled streets.\n\nALSO WATCH: Diving a shipwreck in the Azores archipelago\n\nThe Camino de Santiago has become one of the most famous hikes and is certainly one of the most popular pilgrimage experiences in the world. Irrespective of your age, background, creed or faith these ancient paths that lead to the phenomenal Santiago de Compostela Cathedral - where the remains of St James are said to be buried \u2013 have a special yet different meaning for each person who undertakes the journey. If anything, it's personal. But why is the Camino so popular? Local bespoke travel planner Yolandi van der Wath of Tours to Israel & Beyond, confirmed that bookings from South Africa for the Camino have been increasing steadily. \"It is the ultimate travel with a purpose experience. As with any other trip, the journey already starts at home with physical and mental planning. But when doing a Camino there is also the inner journey that awaits you, and for this you cannot plan. You can only go and receive.\" WATCH: Mussels, tradition and wild beauty in Spain's Galicia 6. A long weekend in Swakopmund - the most German place in Africa Swakopmund might be one of the oddest towns in Namibia.\n\nStrolling through its streets you might think instead of an African town you've stumbled into a wormhole that's transported you to Germany. Signs like 'b\u00e4ckerei' and 'willkommen' are plastered everywhere, the bookshop is pretty much dedicated to the German language and you'll actually struggle to figure out who's a tourist and who's a local (the tan normally helps).\n\nBeyond the language, cuisine and architectural styles also make sure that you never forget about Namibia's German colonial roots, although the streets named after prominent Namibians remind you of their own struggle for freedom.\n\n7. Welgevonden's Mhondoro, where elephants drink from this lodge's pool\n\nZebras munching on yellow blades, a wildebeest looking for a mate, warthogs out on a family stroll - all while never leaving the laziness of a wildlife lodge.\n\nThis is known as a 'sofa safari' - the idea that you don't have to don a wide-brimmed hat and some veld shoes to see wild animals. In some places, they come to you, and at Mhondoro Safari Lodge & Villa, they come with out-of-this-world photo opportunities.\n\nYou might have heard of them - this is the place where elephants drink from their salty swimming pools, making for one extra selfie. At just the right height for their thirsty trunks, the lodge and villa pools have become a favourite watering hole. Read more here.\n\nSingapore is fascinating. And overwhelming. But mostly it\u2019s exhilarating. Coming from a country like South Africa where wild, open spaces form such a naturally broad part of daily life, it struck me front and centre how this city-country, smarting for space, is so future-focused in its architecture and design.", "description": "From Skiing in Lesotho to cruising from Durban to Pomene off Mozambique, there's a holiday idea to entice you in 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/91/d30cbcc7a9284f6db37164227edda02b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
