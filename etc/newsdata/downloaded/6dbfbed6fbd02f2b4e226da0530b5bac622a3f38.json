Maj. Eric Anderson. A public affairs officer for the Utah Guard said the directive is not intended to be a serious mandate and is purely for motivational purposes.\n\n\u201cOne of the weaknesses we noticed in our soldiers is the leg tuck,\u201d Maj.

Soldiers are expected to take two ACFT assessments by this month, and the Army will officially begin administering on-the-record tests starting October 2020.\n\nRead more: British infantry troops painfully show why \u2018battlefield awareness\u2019 is essential in jungle combat\n\nThe ACFT is comprised of six separate, timed events ranging from deadlifts to a two-mile run. The leg tuck, one of the events, requires soldiers to \u201ccomplete as many \u2026 as possible in two minutes\u201d on a pull-up bar as they \u201cmaintain a relative vertical posture while moving the hips and knees up and down without excessive swinging or kipping.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe LTK assesses the strength of the Soldiers grip, arm, shoulder and trunk muscles,\u201d the Army says on its website. \u201cThese muscles assist Soldiers in load carriage and in avoiding injuries to the back.\u201d\n\nThe ACFT is slated to replace the Army\u2019s antiquated Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). The APFT consisted of a timed two-mile run, push-ups, and sit-ups and has been in use by the Army since 1980. Critics assailed the APFT for not adequately measuring the combat readiness of a soldier, and calls for a revamped test prompted the Army to research newer methods of assessing physical fitness.\n\nDespite some concerns in the military community about the new ACFT, namely potential injuries and costs of the program, Gibb said the Utah Guard was \u201cconfident\u201d that the new standards will continue to be met.\n\n\u201cI think we do put an emphasis on the readiness of our soldiers, and it\u2019s attributed to little things like this,\u201d Gibb said.", "description": "Business Insider - \"I think we do put an emphasis on the readiness of our soldiers, and it's attributed\u00a0to little things like this,\" a spokesman said to Insider..
