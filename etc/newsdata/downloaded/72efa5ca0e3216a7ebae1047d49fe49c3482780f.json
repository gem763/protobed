But those are days that might matter enormously, because the crucial and controversial political side effect is that MPs will have less time to try to change the law to stop Boris Johnson taking the UK out of the EU if he can't agree a new deal with Brussels by the end of October.\n\n'Intensely risky'\n\nMPs, including many senior Tories, have already been trying to find a way to take that option off the table, fearing the turmoil.\n\nMr Johnson's move to reduce the time Parliament has to make its moves has been described by some of his opponents as a constitutional outrage.\n\nAnd it might embolden those who were trying to stiffen the spines of former Remain MPs looking for ways to block it - maybe by trying to rush through emergency laws next week or maybe even by a rapid vote of no confidence that could bring down the government.\n\nBut Mr Johnson secured his place in No 10 by promising he'd do whatever it takes to leave the EU on Halloween.\n\nThis decisive and intensely risky plan will satisfy many of those who backed him.\n\nBut some others in his government are worried - moving now, even with the accompanying controversy, he sets the stage and the terms for an epic fight with MPs on all sides.", "description": "Boris Johnson has set himself up for an epic fight with MPs on all sides by deciding to suspend Parliament.", "authors": ["Laura Kuenssberg", "Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/139D6/production/_108524308_94867d13-d052-40d7-9769-948321bf0f48.jpg"}
