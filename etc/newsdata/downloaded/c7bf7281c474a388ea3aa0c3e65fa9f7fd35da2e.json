Sounds decent enough.\n\nBut instead of being sold for cheaper, the store now appeared to be charging \u00a34.25 for the chicken!\n\nAfter Amanda shared the picture on Facebook the likes and comments quickly racked up, with shoppers ready to poke fun at the seemingly innocent pricing error.\n\n\"I love spotting these faux pas', it happens all the time in all supermarkets!\" said one social media user.\n\nAnother joked: \"omg...thats a bargain paying an extra 25p.\"\n\n\"That's not a bargain that's an insult,\" wrote somebody else.\n\nA fourth quipped: \"Wow someone's in trouble.\"\n\nTesco's website says the same product has been reduced down from \u00a35 to \u00a34.25 - stating a saving of 75p.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesco told Manchester Evening News : \"We\u2019re sorry for the incorrect labelling on this product, it has now been updated in the store to show the correct reduction from \u00a35 to \u00a34.25.\"\n\nDespite what many consumers believe, according to Citizens' Advice, if you take an item to the till and are told the price is a mistake, you don't have the right to buy the item at a lower price.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nYou can still ask the store to honour the price, but they don't have to.\n\nThe same rule applies if you see an item advertised anywhere for a lower price than that on the price tag.\n\nIf you've already bought the item, and the shop's sold an item to you for less than they meant to, they're only legally allowed to ask for money back if you'd spoken about price and they ended up charging you much less.\n\nIf you realise you've paid more for an item than it was advertised for at the time you can ask the shop to refund the difference.", "description": "Those hoping to pick up a bargain in the Stowmarket store in Suffolk were surprised to find a poultry problem", "authors": ["Rachel Pugh", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Lightrocket Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464689.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/71146104_2810254015653862_4402269632187072512_o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
