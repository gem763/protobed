But we can\u2019t. Because they\u2019ve cancelled it.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe aircraft that we are due to receive in the next few years, the 777-9, has a 374-seat, four-class configuration as against the A380 which has 517 on it today.\n\n\u201cWe will either have to procure more slots, which I\u2019m not sure would happen if we don\u2019t have the third runway, or go elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nEmirates also serves Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow. \u201cWe put 1,230 seats a day into Birmingham,\u201d said Sir Tim.\n\nA Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to delivering the benefits of expansion as soon as possible \u2013 creating more jobs, boosting exports and lowering air fares by increasing competition amongst airlines.\n\n\u201cThe Airports National Policy Statement requires a new runway to be delivered no later than 2030, and our plans could secure these benefits as early as 2026.\u201d\n\nThe transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was due to speak at the Airlines 2050 event on Thursday but pulled out due to Brexit developments.", "description": "The president of one of the world\u2019s most successful airlines, Emirates, has predicted the planned expansion of Heathrow airport will be delayed or cancelled.
