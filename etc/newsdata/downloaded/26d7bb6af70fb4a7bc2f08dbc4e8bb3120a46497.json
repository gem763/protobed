The remarks were attributed to First Vice Minister Choe Son Hui, one of the Kim regime\u2019s most prominent interlocutors with the U.S. Ms. Choe said formal nuclear talks would occur at a yet-to-be-determined time and place in late September.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How should the Trump administration address this launch in its denuclearization negotiations with North Korea? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cI think the U.S. has since had enough time to find the calculation method that it can share with us,\u201d Ms. Choe was quoted as saying.\n\nPresident Trump, speaking to reporters Monday on his way to a rally in North Carolina, said he had seen Pyongyang\u2019s state-media report about a potential meeting. \u201cWe will see what happens, but I always say having meetings is a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nNuclear talks have remained gridlocked since the two sides left February\u2019s Vietnam summit without a deal. North Korea has responded with repeated short-range missile tests and angry missives in state media directed at U.S. policy and senior officials.\n\nMr. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held an impromptu June 30 meeting, agreeing to restart official denuclearization talks. But no formal talks have occurred in the ensuing two months.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s launch of two short-range projectiles early Tuesday was its eighth test since July 25. The missiles were launched from the Kaecheon area of the North\u2019s South Pyongan province, the first at 6:53 a.m. local time and the second 19 minutes later, according to Seoul\u2019s military. The projectiles flew about 205 miles, though Seoul did not specify where they landed. The Kim regime last test-fired a weapon on Aug. 24.\n\n\u201cWe urge North Korea to immediately halt acts that escalate tensions,\u201d South Korea\u2019s military said in a statement.\n\nIn Washington, a senior administration official said the U.S. was aware of the reported launch, and would continue to monitor the situation and coordinate with regional allies.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday he hopes denuclearization talks with North Korea will resume \u201cin the coming days or perhaps weeks.\u201d\n\nIn an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said the administration is disappointed that Mr. Kim has continued to conduct short-range missile tests, but said the North Korean leader \u201chas not yet violated\u201d his commitment to Mr. Trump. He didn\u2019t address the fact that the tests violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, according to many weapons experts.\n\nThe Japanese Defense Ministry said the missiles didn\u2019t land in the nation\u2019s territorial waters or its wider exclusive economic zone. None of North Korea\u2019s recent missile launches have done so. Pyongyang\u2019s state media didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\n\nIn a rare policy speech in April, Mr. Kim warned the U.S. to shift its negotiating stance by year\u2019s end. The two sides left Vietnam after an abrupt breakdown in talks that revealed wide disagreements over how, and when, the North should surrender its nuclear weapons program.\n\nBut Mr. Kim knows Mr. Trump represents his best chance for a nuclear deal\u2014and time may be running out as the president turns increasingly to his re-election campaign, said Jean H. Lee, director of the Korea program at the Wilson Center, a non-partisan think tank in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe North Koreans aren\u2019t sure which of its usual tactics \u2014 charm or threats\u2014will be more effective in gaining leverage with Washington right now, so they\u2019re doing a little of both,\u201d Ms. Lee said.\n\nThe North\u2019s pair of Tuesday moves, one for diplomacy and another for provocation, is another example of how Pyongyang has been the initiator with Washington, security experts said. After the two countries\u2019 leaders held their June 30 meeting, the U.S. has repeatedly said it was ready to sit down with the North.\n\nBut the Kim regime continued to take an angry stance for much of July and August over joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises that the North perceived as a threat. Those maneuvers ended late last month.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea times things on its terms, reaches out on its terms, and raises tensions on its terms,\u201d said Mintaro Oba, a former State Department official involved in North Korea policy.\n\nTalks between the U.S. and North Korea raised hopes that Kim Jong Un will stop developing or even surrender his nuclear weapons. But security experts point to satellite images that they say show North Korea ramping up production of its arsenal over the past year.
