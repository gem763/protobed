It purchases sunflower oil from Ukraine.\n\n($1 = 70.9975 Indian rupees)", "description": "India's top vegetable oil trade body called on Tuesday for the government to close a South Asian regional free-trade pact loophole it said had been used to circumvent tax by re-routing palm oil and soyoil imports through Nepal and Bangladesh.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
