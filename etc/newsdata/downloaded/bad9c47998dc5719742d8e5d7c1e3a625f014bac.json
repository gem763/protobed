In his more than 13 years in office, poverty has dropped steadily in South America\u2019s poorest country. But he has lost support following allegations about manipulation of the justice system, his insistence on running for yet another term and corruption scandals.\n\nThe 59-year-old son of Aymara Indian shepherds is seeking his third consecutive re-election next month. Polls point to a competitive race in the Oct. 20 vote, which would go to a second round if no candidate wins an outright majority.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Morales\u2019 Museum of the Democratic and Cultural Revolution of Orinoca seeks to pay tribute to his image beyond his days in power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re great warriors and this museum is the patrimony of those who fought for the liberation of our peoples,\u201d Morales said when the museum opened in 2017.\n\nCritics disagree. \u201cThis museum seeks to build a myth behind Morales by showing him as a messianic leader,\u201d said Carlos Cordero, a political analyst. \u201cBut it\u2019s the best example of the mismanagement of state funds.\u201d\n\nThe museum rising from the wind-swept Andean plateau is divided into three sections and has about a dozen halls. Although it seeks to preserve Bolivia\u2019s indigenous past, it holds only a few pre-Hispanic pieces, and most of them are replicas. Among the displays are ceramic figures, scale models and paintings that narrate indigenous traditions in the Andes cordillera, from the first settlements dating back 15,000 years to the birth of the Tiwanaku state and the rise of the Incan empire.\n\nThe instructive exhibits allow visitors to learn a great deal about Andean cultures and the outcomes of the invasion of the Spanish colonizers some 500 years ago.\n\nVisitors, however, won\u2019t just look at the past. Hundreds of gifts to Morales during his travels around the globe were donated to the museum. They include a T-shirt from Argentina national team captain and five-time world best soccer player Lionel Messi, an autographed ball from the Premier League\u2019s Chelsea soccer club and several honorary degrees from universities.\n\nMuseum officials say the mix of objects showcased allows visitors to get a closer look at Bolivia\u2019s history as well as the \u201cprocess of change\u201d led by Morales.\n\nA chronology on a museum wall narrates the indigenous rebellions, beginning with one led by the Aymara native Tupaj Katari in 1781 and ending with the \u201cprocess of empowerment of the Bolivian indigenous movements\u201d that resulted in Morales becoming the country\u2019s first indigenous president.\n\n\u201cEveryone says it\u2019s the Evo museum, but it\u2019s not,\u201d said Mercedes Bernab\u00e9, who is in charge of the museum. \u201cIt\u2019s recognition to Evo, but it\u2019s much more than that. Here we have the 36 indigenous peoples and the history of the country.\u201d\n\nCulture Minister Wilma Alanoca has said that although \u201cthere are people who want to defenestrate this work,\u201d the museum not only recovers history, but also seeks to encourage community tourism.\n\nOne of the halls includes a life-size statue of Morales as well as portraits and photos. There is Morales as a young shepherd, as a union leader fighting for the rights of coca growers, and later as a lawmaker meeting with world leaders like Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro.\n\nBut the museum\u2019s location contrasts with the international pomp. Orinoca is a humble village of farmers and llama shepherds with a population of less than 1,000 people. Poverty is visible along its cobbled streets and adobe houses. Only a few streets are paved, and many homes lack potable water and sewage systems.\n\nNeighbors who migrated have returned with savings and are transforming their adobe and thatched-roof houses into brick homes, but locals still have demands for their president.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t done much for Orinoca,\u201d said one man who said he went to school with Morales. He agreed to give only his first name, Mois\u00e9s, fearing reprisals.\n\n\u201cHe was a good student, a good friend, an athlete and a musician. When he comes back to visit, he greets me,\u201d Mois\u00e9s said.\n\nMorales did deliver on his promise to pave a road that goes through the town and links it with the ports in northern Chile. On both sides of the road, llamas can be seen grazing.\n\nThe museum remains Orinoca\u2019s main attraction, although there is another important site on the other side of town: It\u2019s a two-room adobe house that still has a thatched roof. It\u2019s locked under bolt and its windows are boarded over. But there are no fences and a flag representing the ruling party waves in the wind. It\u2019s the home where Morales was born and lived until age 15.\n\n\u201cBefore we saw him more concerned about the people. Now, not so much,\u201d said a woman who has a modest neighborhood store. She also would reveal only her first name, Maria, saying she feared what the government could do if she spoke out freely in Morales\u2019 hometown.\n\n\u201cIf he goes out (of office) or gets (re-elected), it\u2019s all the same to me,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "From the air, it stands like a concrete fortress amid the humble adobe and brick homes in the remote town of Orinoca high up in the desert of the Bolivian altiplano.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Carlos Valdez"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/bolivia_evo_museum_87621_c0-39-4000-2371_s1770x1032.jpg?400b99d1025f5098b991751670a3290df0248da8", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
