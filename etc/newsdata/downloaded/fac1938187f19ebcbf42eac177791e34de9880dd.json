Teachers found guilty of misconduct in this regard can simply move schools or provinces and continue to work with pupils despite them being implicated in sexual misconduct with, what are often, minors,\u201d he said.\n\nDepartment spokesperson Sihle Mlotshwa said the department was not aware of the case. \u201cWe have asked the Zululand District to give us a report in this regard. These are serious allegations and the department will treat them as such. If these are proven to be true, the department will not hesitate to act in the interest of pupils,\u201d he said.", "description": "The DA in Zululand wants Phongolo police to investigate a possible statutory rape case against a school teacher there who allegedly dated and lived with one of his pupils.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/669/04bf61d849694f4e9beb1f3ec0341093.jpg", "published_at": "2015-11-11"}
