Canada and several states in the United States have moved recently to legalize such possessions.\n\nWhen asked whether the Australian federal government should intervene to override the ACT legislation, Porter said it would not be necessary.\n\n\"If they leave their law as it is, why would there be any need to override a law which is effectively to no effect?\" he said.\n\n\"My advice and the advice that I've provided to the ACT attorney-general is that it is still against the law of the Commonwealth to possess cannabis in the ACT.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the government said it would provide funds for research on medicinal marijuana, responding to a growing demand.\n\nWhile legal in most of Australia, medicinal cannabis products are allowed only to patients on the prescription of a doctor, and a license is required to grow and make medicinal cannabis.\n\n(Reporting by Lidia Kelly, Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "description": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter said on Sunday that Canberra's new legislation legalizing possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use do not provide legal protection and clash with federal laws.", "authors": ["Lidia Kelly"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
