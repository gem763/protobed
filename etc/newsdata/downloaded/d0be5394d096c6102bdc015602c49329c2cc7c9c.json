It's decorated with a small furry white rug which is unevenly shaped, and a circle mirror leans against the wall on the floor.\n\nShe swapped a house plant for a vase of pampas grass in a funky vase, and a piece of fine art can be seen framed and leaving on her floor through the mirror's reflection.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nLike many of us, Stacey relaxes at home with a candle and a good binge on TV shows.\n\nAnother circle mirror appears in the corner, and a table matching the one in her kitchen.\n\nShe has a large flat screen TV placed neatly on the wall and again, more vases of flowers dotted around.\n\nHer lavish \u00a31,000 MacBook can be seen lying on the table top, which suggests she's into her technology.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nSticking with the cosy vibe, fluffy blankets and throws can be seen on the sofa, perfect for a snuggle.\n\nThe Strictly star can be seen standing in a vintage looking hallway with an oak dining table and chairs and a huge staircase.\n\nThe stone wall gives off a stylish country home touch, with floor-length cream curtains to complete the look.", "description": "The TV presenter boasts an inviting, cosy home with chic interior and a flower and candle obsession", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20394146.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_stacey-dooley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
