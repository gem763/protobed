US special operations forces targeted Baghdadi in a raid near Idlib, officials said.\n\nThe Washington Post published a gasp-inducing headline for the ages on Sunday, describing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d.\n\nThe obituary, written by The Post\u2019s National Security reporter Joby Warrick, followed confirmation of al-Baghdadi\u2019s death in a US military operation in Syria on Saturday night.\n\nIt detailed al-Baghdadi\u2019s rise to the terrorist group\u2019s shadow leader from what the paper described as his origins as a \u201creligious scholar with wireframe glasses\u201d.\n\nThe headline read, \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48\u201d.\n\nThe story first appeared to run under a headline that referred to al-Baghdadi as the \u201cIslamic State\u2019s \u2018terrorist-in-chief\u2019\u201d. It was unclear why or who decided to change the \u201cterrorist\u201d label to \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d.\n\nThe Post then changed the headline again, settling on \u201cextremist leader of Islamic State\u201d.\n\nThe Washington Post vice president of communications Kristine Coratti Kelly told Fox News, \u201cRegarding our al-Baghdadi obituary, the headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted that she had \u201cno words\u201d regarding the Post headline.\n\nFormer press secretary Sean Spicer also responded, writing, \u201cStop, read this & think about it: last night a ruthless, brutal terrorist who threatened our country & is responsible for the death of American citizens was killed in a successful operation by US military & @washingtonpost described #Albagdadi as an \u2018austere religious scholar\u2019.\u201d\n\nI have no words. https://t.co/4zH9Ji0Smy \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 27, 2019\n\nOthers on social media took notice of the bizarre headline changes, taking digs at the paper.\n\n\u201cThey had it right the first time,\u201d Yashar Ali, New York Magazine and HuffPost contributor tweeted, alongside screenshots of the two headlines.\n\nThey had it right the first time.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post changed the headline on its Al-Baghdadi obituary from \u201cIslamic State\u2019s terrorist-in-Chief\u201d to \u201caustere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State.\u201d pic.twitter.com/cs243EVz7W \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201c@washingtonpost trying desperately to hold on to #ISIS online subscribers,\u201d Wyoming Republican Representative Liz Cheney said.\n\nSocial media users mocked the paper by writing death notices for other historic figures who committed crimes and atrocities.\n\n\u201c#WaPoDeathNotices Genghis Khan, accomplished horseman and indefatigable traveller, breathes his last,\u201d Bard College professor and The Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Russell Mead wrote.\n\n\u201cAdolf Hitler, passionate community planner and dynamic public speaker, dies at 56.#WaPoDeathNotices,\u201d wrote Jason Howerton.\n\nMao Zedong, who saved 20-45 million of his own people from having to suffer through the struggle of existence, dies at 82.#WaPoDeathNotices pic.twitter.com/4wwJqQqXp3 \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) October 27, 2019\n\nBloomberg and The New York Times were also criticised for lukewarm comments about the terrorist leader\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIslamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi transformed himself from a little-known teacher of Koranic recitation into the self-proclaimed ruler of an entity that covered swathes of Syria and Iraq,\u201d Bloomberg wrote in a tweet.\n\nWhat the hell is going on pic.twitter.com/mvcYZdAziA \u2014 Harry Khachatrian (@Harry1T6) October 27, 2019\n\nThe New York Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi said in a Twitter thread, \u201cWe are familiar with the atrocities his group carried out & are used to thinking of Baghdadi as a criminal & a thug. But those who knew him as a teen & as a young man described him as having a spiritual gift.\u201d\n\nAmericans: \"we are disgusted by WaPo trying to humanize and sympathize this savage, enemy of all that's decent in the world, who murdered thousands, including many journalists\".\n\n\n\nRukmini Callimachi: \"Hold my beer\". \u2014 DecentAmerican (@DecentAmerican1) October 27, 2019\n\nUnder Al-Baghdadi\u2019s leadership, IS carried out a slew of barbaric atrocities, including the enslavement and rape of thousands of women from Iraq\u2019s Yazidi minority. They massacred captives and threw individuals believed to be gay from the rooftops of buildings.\n\nJournalists and aid workers were beheaded, including Americans, in videos and photos the terror group broadcast with delight.\n\nJames Foley, an American journalist, was beheaded by IS terrorists in August 2014 while covering the Syrian civil war. Foley, 45, was the first US citizen to be murdered by the terrorist group.\n\nThe beheadings of Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, and Peter Kassig, an American aid worker and former Army Ranger, followed the death of Foley. The beheadings of all three were broadcast on video.\n\nKayla Mueller, another American aid worker, was also killed at the hands of ISIS, after having been taken hostage in 2013 and forced to \u201cmarry\u201d one of their leaders. Her death was confirmed in 2015.\n\nThe killings and barbaric treatment extended to citizens from other countries, including journalists from Britain and Japan, who were also beheaded.\n\nIn December 2014, Jordanian pilot Muath Al-Kaseasbeh was shot down and captured in Syria. He was taken hostage and months later seen on video being burned alive in a cage.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the death of al-Baghdadi on Sunday morning, describing him as dying \u201cin a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying\u201d.\n\nAl-Baghdadi had retreated to a dead-end tunnel, taking three children with him, and detonated a suicide vest. He along with the children were killed in the blast.\n\nFox News\u2019 Nick Givas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fox News and was reproduced with permission", "description": "The Washington Post published a gasp-inducing headline for the ages on Sunday, describing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as an \u201caustere religious scholar\u201d.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5158500d1ea17e455f45a64ff6409680?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
