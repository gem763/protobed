Russia?\" tweeted one fan, while another tweeted a GIF of WWE superstar Rusev pulling into an arena in a tank with a Russian flag with the message: \"Suddenly I love Russia\".\n\nSuddenly I love Russia pic.twitter.com/zlmXelnuSj \u2014 Y Gwyllgi \ud83c\udf18\ud83d\udc3a ~ \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc77\udb40\udc6c\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc7f (@Jayfuz) October 22, 2019\n\nAnother fan, inspired by Volkov's Rocky IV-themed nickname \"Drago\" simply posted a GIF of Dolph Lundgren's legendary character, which carried the famous line: \"If he dies, he dies.\"\n\nAnd one sarcastic fan tweeted Hardy and his management to make a medical inquiry, asking if the heavyweight would be bringing his now-infamous inhaler to Russia with him.", "description": "Controversial UFC star Greg Hardy will now take on Alexander Volkov at UFC Moscow, with the bout dropping down the card to the co-main event slot, and fans have flocked to social media to claim their backing for the Russian star.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5daf6adc2030271a6c1a531e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
