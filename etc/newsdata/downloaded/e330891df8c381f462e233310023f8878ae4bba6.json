Stephanie mused: \u2018It\u2019s quite up in the air. They both want the same thing, but other things keep getting in the way.\u2019\n\n(Picture: Lime Pictures)\n\nTo be fair to both characters, with devastation set to ensue within the village, it\u2019s not like romance would be at the top of their agendas anyways.\n\nYes, Hollyoaks never disappoints when it comes to stunts, and this one is set to be their biggest yet, as pretty much every character is involved in one way or another. What\u2019s more, Cindy hasn\u2019t featured in one in quite a while, which is why Stephanie was so chuffed to have been a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018Doing it was like a little bubble to be honest, it was so different from the regular Hollyoaks, it felt like a different show for a while. I loved it \u2014 it was very nostalgic being on set with everyone who I\u2019ve known for so long. It was exciting as well doing a stunt \u2014 I\u2019ve not done a stunt since the bus crash back in 2012. It was nice to be at the centre of this one.\u2019\n\nYes, Cindy is indeed very much at the centre of this one, what with her and builder Woody (Jake Quickenden) having ignored the safety regulations, which is no doubt something that will play on her mind in coming episodes.\n\nStephanie mused: \u2018I think initially, she does feel responsible, but then she realises that she isn\u2019t entirely responsible for what happened. Initially she does, but then she passes the blame onto somebody else.\u2019\n\nWho that somebody else is has yet to be revealed, but given that plenty of villagers play a part in the upcoming devastation \u2014 including Luke, Breda (Moya Brady) and Woody \u2014 any one of them could end up paying the price for their actions.\n\nSpeaking of Woody, Stephanie would love to see the character \u2014 and, of course, Jake \u2014 pop up again in Hollyoaks in the future.\n\n\u2018I love Jake, I\u2019ve known him for a long time. It\u2019s so different from Dancing On Ice where we were competitors \u2014 and here he was on my turf! He\u2019s such a natural. He kept everyone\u2019s spirits up on set, and had this new energy that he brought \u2014 always laughing, always making jokes. He got on well with everybody, he was so polite. He was great. I\u2019d really love it if he came back for a bigger stint.\u2019\n\nHollyoaks continues Tuesday 29th October at 7pm on E4\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Actress Stephanie revealed what lies ahead for Luke and Cindy following their confrontation, and spoke about the devastating stunt week.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5288-CINDY-TOM-WOODY-01-032f_1572289769.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
