REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n\nThe global payments business, which covers anything from card payments to wiring money overseas, is dominated by banks and this year was worth around $1.5 trillion, professional services firm Accenture said in a report published on Monday.\n\nThat is expected to grow to $2 trillion globally by 2025 but banks are likely to lose out on $280 billion, or 15% of their global payments revenues, Accenture estimates.\n\nBanks face rising competition from tech start-ups like Silicon Valley payment providers Stripe and Square, as well as technology platform PayPal, and the likes of London-based TransferWise that offer foreign exchange payments to retail and small business customers with lower fees.\n\nMore payments are becoming instant - removing the need for credit cards that earn banks revenue - and they will increasingly be made directly to the end merchant using new technology, Accenture said. More competition also means a squeeze on margins and accelerates the trend toward free payments.\n\n\u201cRather than being at the forefront of the new wave of the booming payments market, banks are feeling the heat from new competition and seeing their margins squeezed,\u201d said Gareth Wilson, head of Accenture\u2019s global payments team.\n\n\u201cWe face an inevitable world of instant, invisible and free payments, which spells trouble for banks that don\u2019t want to be relegated to the plumbing of payments.\u201d\n\nAccenture said it had examined trends in how consumers pay and projected changes in the future behavior of payments providers, technology and regulation to arrive at its forecasts on the likely loss of revenue for banks.\n\nIt estimated that free payments would put 8% of banks\u2019 payment revenue at risk. A further 3.9% is at risk from non-bank rivals offering \u201cinvisible payments\u201d, while instant payments could take another 2.7% of revenues.\n\nMore than two-thirds of banking executives surveyed by Accenture agreed that payments were becoming free.\n\n\u201cThe digital boom will mean banks have to fundamentally change the way they think about their revenue composition,\u201d said Alan McIntyre, who leads Accenture\u2019s banking practice.\n\n\u201cChannels that once made the banks billions of dollars will cease to exist,\u201d McIntyre said, adding that lenders needed to build new digital business models, with \u201cone-click payments the new norm.\u201d", "description": "Banks are set to miss out on as much as $280 billion in revenue from their payments operations by 2025, as new start-ups muscle in and more of the business of sending money to individuals and companies becomes instant and free, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Tommy Wilkes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430372132&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0GN", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
