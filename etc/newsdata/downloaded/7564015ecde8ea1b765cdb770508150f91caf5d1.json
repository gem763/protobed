The veteran coaches worked together on the NBC reality series since it first began in 2011 and developed an on-air bromance over the years that always kept the audience laughing.\n\nNow that Adam is gone, we'll see Blake juggle a different kind of relationship on the show, this time with his girlfriend Gwen Stefani. While the country coach had been known to butt heads with the Maroon 5 frontman, it doesn't sound like Blake has any plans to fight with Adam's replacement.\n\n\"I couldn't be happier that [Gwen's] back on the show. Literally, you know, with Adam being gone\u2014I'm not gonna lie, that was scary. It's weird without him here, it's literally shocking to not have him here,\" Blake confessed to ET. \"But I'll take [Gwen] way over whatever I had with Adam.\"\n\nSpeaking of their frenemy behavior, Blake also sent out this sentiment to his former co-star: \"Adam's not on the show and I want him to know that he can still kiss my a** wherever he is right now,\" Blake said.\n\nThough Blake will clearly miss his pal, season 17 of The Voice has been great for the \"Hell Right\" singer, as he and Gwen love working together.\n\nPhoto credit: NBC More\n\n\"They laugh so much on set and backstage, and aren't shy about showing their affection and are better than ever,\" a source confirmed. \"They're truly like a married couple who hasn't lost that spark.\"\n\nStill, Blake acknowledges that it is a competition\u2014and they're both in it to win it.\n\n\"You know, she wants to win and I want to win and that's what they pay us to do on this show...is to try to win the show,\" he said. \"It's harder for [Gwen]. She's not competitive. She'll be the first to tell you right up until it gets competitive and then all of a sudden she is.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "He definitely misses Shevine.", "authors": ["Kelly O'Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XoOydf9V9O60.xLDoHfwxA--~B/aD03MjY7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/country_living_105/0789599a77185b383d3b775431db242b", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
