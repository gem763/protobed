Venezuela's Information Ministry also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's government has imposed sanctions on dozens of top Venezuelan officials as well as state oil company PDVSA in an effort to remove Maduro, whom it accuses of fixing elections last year and abusing human rights in the oil-rich nation.\n\nIn August, Washington froze all Venezuelan state assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on any company continuing to do business with the government.\n\nThe senators said in their letter to Mnuchin - made public on Tuesday - that CFIUS should investigate the business transactions among JBS, the Venezuelan Corporation of Foreign Trade (CORPOVEX) and Diosdado Cabello, a powerful ally of Maduro who is under U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe senators did not provide any further details about the alleged transactions.\n\nThe senators said JBS had engaged in the bribery of public officials in Brazil to obtain funds to expand abroad, acquiring in recent years U.S. meat-packer Swift Foods Co and chicken producer Pilgrim's Pride Corp.\n\nBrothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, founders of JBS's holding company J&F, signed plea bargain and leniency deals in May 2017 in which they confessed to running a political bribery ring in Brazil.\n\n\"We ask CFIUS conduct a review of JBS SA's acquisition of U.S. companies to assess the implications for security and safety of America's food supply and, in turn, our national security,\" the senators said in their letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "description": "Two U.S. senators called on the U.S. Treasury on Tuesday to open an investigation into the world's largest meat processing company, Brazil's JBS S.A. , due to alleged ties with the Venezuelan government of leftist President Nicolas Maduro.
