Why are 11 people trying?", "language": "en", "text": "The moonshot nature of these candidacies, and the fervor for them regardless \u2014 the candidates, in both parties, have made the rounds on Fox News and become darlings of conservative media \u2014 underscores the fame and rancor that have surrounded Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters\u2019 resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party\u2019s other electoral goals. By encouraging attacks on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Republicans hope to inspire a trickle-down effect onto lower-profile, but much more vulnerable, Democrats\u2026\n\nBut for the challengers, running \u2014 even with a near-guarantee of defeat \u2014 has few downsides. They can raise thousands off Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s name alone; earn exposure for future campaigns; and bask in the attention, even if only for a short time.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Nyregion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
