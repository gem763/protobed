Unfortunately the market does not like surprises,\" Seaport Global analyst Kevin Sterling said.\n\nUPS volume for Next Day Air delivery within the United States rose about 24% in the quarter ended Sept. 30, benefiting from strong e-commerce demand and rival FedEx Corp's (N: ) breakup with online retailer Amazon.com Inc (O: ) this summer.\n\n\"It's Amazon, but it's beyond Amazon,\" Chief Executive David Abney said in a telephone interview with Reuters.\n\n\"Companies are competing on time. Next Day has become the standard. We see it in our Next Day Ground and our Next Day Air,\" said Abney, who noted that the company's multi-billion-dollar investments in network upgrades have shaved per-package costs down 2.5%.\n\nDespite the advantage, investors remain wary of the potential ill-effects of the ongoing US-China trade war on the company as it gears up for what could be its biggest holiday season in history.\n\nUPS net income rose 16% to $1.75 billion, or $2.01 per share, in the third quarter.\n\nRevenue rose 5% to $18.32 billion.\n\nExcluding items, the company earned $2.07 per share.\n\nAnalysts on average had estimated earnings of $2.06 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.", "description": "UPS COO's retirement overshadows e-commerce fueled profit rise", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L11P-OCABS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
