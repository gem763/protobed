The undertaking helps give certainty to both NBN Co and the market about the way we build our network and how Australian businesses can benefit.\n\n\"Providing competitive offerings to help meet the needs of business has always been part of NBN Co\u2019s intent. The outcomes that we have agreed with the ACCC provide a transparent platform which confirms NBN Co\u2019s crucial role in the business segment. In fact, we\u2019re now even better placed to deliver value for the industry and for business customers.\"\n\nUntil last year NBN Co's focus had been on the residential market, for which it has a wholesale monopoly. But late last year it announced its intention to move more aggressively in the enterprise market, which remains open to competition.\n\nNBN Co insists this was always part of the plan, but the move nevertheless upset the private sector, drawing accusations of \"scope creep\" and prompting TPG Telecom boss David Teoh to complain to the government that NBN Co was directly targeting TPG's business clients.\n\nAt Telstra's full year results in August, chief executive Andy Penn said the move into the enterprise market would cost the telco giant an extra $400 million a year in ongoing annual earnings, bringing the total annual earnings hole to $3.4 billion by 2022.\n\nLast month Mr Penn said he had been \"surprised\" by NBN's move into the enterprise market.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t necessarily anticipating that, particularly when on the one hand the rollout of the network is slowing down, and on the other hand they\u2019re diverting capital into building more fibre in the CBD than is necessary,\" he said.\n\nHowever at the same event Telstra head of enterprise Michael Ebeid said the company would do more deals with NBN Co's enterprise segment as businesses increasingly demand fibre connectivity over copper.\n\nMr Sims said overall NBN Co's move into the enterprise market was promoting competition.\n\n\"Market feedback suggests that NBN Co\u2019s entry into the wholesale enterprise market has increased competition, particularly in areas where Telstra is the only other fixed-line infrastructure provider,\" he said.", "description": "The competition regulator has slapped NBN Co with a formal warning for discriminating between retail service providers in the provision of its nascent enterprise business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2238%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f5b57bee7c31de177d562ec1a49417a4fad33fdd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
