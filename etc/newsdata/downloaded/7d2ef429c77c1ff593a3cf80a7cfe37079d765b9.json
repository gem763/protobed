The Communist party took 13 seats, up from five last time, while the A Just Russia party won three seats. Both parties are widely seen as part of the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cloyal opposition\u201d.\n\nAll four candidates from Yabloko, Russia\u2019s oldest liberal party, won their districts. Yabloko was the only genuinely independent party allowed on the ballot in Moscow.\n\nUnited Russia\u2019s candidates all ran as nominal \u201cindependents\u201d in an apparent attempt to distance themselves from their increasingly unpopular party. An opinion poll published before the election by an independent thinktank indicated that United Russia was backed by just 11% of voters in Moscow. The state-run pollster said in April that Putin\u2019s party was backed by 22% of voters in the Russian capital.\n\nAndrei Metelsky, who heads United Russia\u2019s branch in Moscow, was the most high-profile of United Russia\u2019s covert candidates to lose their seats on the council. United Russia described his election defeat to a little-known socialist backed by the Communist party as \u201cunpleasant\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, has called for an investigation into allegations of excessive force by police during the demonstrations.

More than 2,500 people were arrested by riot police carrying batons amid chaotic scenes around Red Square. Michelle Bachelet, the UN\u2019s human rights chief, called for an inquiry on Monday into allegations of excessive force used by Russian police to break up the peaceful protests.\n\nReports said the Kremlin had banned the opposition candidates after internal polling had indicated they would win at least nine seats. While the city council has few powers, analysts say the Kremlin was reluctant to allow Navalny\u2019s allies a foothold on the electoral ladder ahead of far more significant parliamentary polls due in 2021.\n\nProfile Who is Alexei Navalny? Show Hide Born in 1976 just outside Moscow, Alexei Navalny is a lawyer-turned-campaigner whose Anti-Corruption Foundation carries out investigations into the wealth of Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle. He started out as a Russian nationalist, but emerged as the main leader of Russia's democratic opposition during the wave of protests that led up to the 2012 presidential election, and has since been a constant thorn in the Kremlin\u2019s side. Navalny is barred from appearing on state television, but has used social media to his advantage. A 2017 documentary accusing the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, of corruption received more than 30m views on YouTube within two months of release.\n\nHe has been repeatedly arrested and jailed by the authorities. The European court of human rights ruled that Russia violated Navalny's rights by holding him under house arrest in 2014. Election officials formally barred him from running for president in 2018 due to an embezzlement conviction that he claims was politically motivated. Navalny told the commission its decision would be a vote \u201cnot against me, but against 16,000 people who have nominated me, against 200,000 volunteers who have been canvassing for me\u201d. There has also been a physical price to pay. In April 2017, he was hospitalised after being attacked with green dye that nearly blinded him in one eye, and in July 2019 was taken from jail to hospital with symptoms that one of his doctors said could indicate poisoning. His main strength in opposition has been in bringing large numbers of protesters out on to Russia's streets. At times, Navalny has seemed to find short spells in jail an energising rather than demoralising experience. \u201cThere were some others in the jail, and for all of them it was their first protest in their lives,\" he once said. \"When they saw me walking past, they were calling out, \u2018When\u2019s the next protest?\u2019 They weren\u2019t asking if there would be one, they wanted to know when.\u201d\n\nPhotograph: Pavel Golovkin/AP\n\nNavalny, 43, portrayed the city council elections as a referendum on United Russia and Putin. He appealed to voters to cast their ballots for United Russia\u2019s strongest challengers, even if they represented political parties that they would not normally vote for, such as the Communists.\n\nNavalny launched a \u201csmart-voting\u201d website and app aimed at making it easy for candidates to identify the candidates able to inflict the most damage on United Russia at the polls. \u201cWe can say clearly that smart voting has worked,\u201d he said after the results.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A police officer stands guard near a voting booth. Photograph: Shamil Zhumatov/Reuters\n\nSergei Sobyanin, the Kremlin-backed mayor of Moscow, said the elections were the most competitive in recent history. \u201cPassions flared,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough it was difficult to say exactly how great an influence strategic voting had on the final results, some of the victorious candidates acknowledged its role. Yandiev Magomet, who was nominated by the A Just Russia party, said Navalny\u2019s backing was vital to his defeat of a far more high-profile United Russia candidate.\n\nMagomet admitted, however, that he supported many of Putin\u2019s policies. \u201cBut I was against the use of force against [election] protesters. These people wanted what\u2019s best for Moscow,\u201d he said.\n\nFour people have been sentenced to prison on charges related to the election protests. Konstantin Kotov, an anti-Putin activist, was imprisoned for four years last week after being found guilty of attending five unsanctioned, but peaceful protests.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin casts his vote.

United Russia also lost its majority in Irkutsk, in eastern Siberia.\n\nPutin\u2019s party fared much better at governor elections, however. Its incumbents all triumphed in the first round. Six of its sitting governors also ran as independents, including in St Petersburg.\n\nThere were multiple allegations of vote fraud across Russia, including a voting urn reportedly being stolen from a polling station in St Petersburg. In Tuva, near Russia\u2019s border with Mongolia, men on horseback opened fire at a van carrying election observers and journalists. No one was hurt in the incident.\n\nState media said the elections were free and fair. Putin rejected suggestions that more candidates should have been allowed to stand, saying the quality of the candidates was more important than their quantity.", "description": "Opposition figure hails success of tactical voting campaign in local elections", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ae795cf35c87a114df6678de46f942e3f56b93/0_260_5218_3131/master/5218.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e9f63fec3c72dd7f2c0432f93c3429c", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
