Kamala Harris, D-Calif., announced that she would no longer appear at a scheduled event at a historically black college and university on Saturday, after President Trump received an honor from an organization co-hosting the event. Then, Harris, an HBCU graduate herself, announced that she would attend the event because the controversial co-host had been \"removed.\"\n\nThe event took place this weekend at Benedict College in South Carolina. The school co-hosted the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum and welcomed the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, which co-hosted the event, and city mayor Stephen Benjamin.\n\n(MORE: State Department official appears under subpoena as part of impeachment probe)\n\nControversy initially ensued after President Trump delivered a keynote speech at the college before accepting an award from the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center for his work on criminal justice, on Friday.\n\nPHOTO: A supporter of President Donald Trump, right, clashes with an anti-Trump protester, left, outside the president's appearance at a criminal justice forum on Friday, Oct. 25, 2019, in Columbia, S.C.

Harris then agreed to appear at the event as planned.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Benjamin said that Benedict College had taken \"full operational control\" of the candidate forum.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been trying to work earnestly and in the long-term interests of Benedict College,\" Benjamin said.\n\nAfter she agreed to rejoin, she thanked Benjamin in her speech for his leadership and his rebranding of the forum.\n\nPHOTO: Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris speaks during a rally at Aiken High School in Aiken, S.C.

Everyone else had to remain in their dorm rooms or watch the forum remotely.\n\n\"I\u2019m not upset about [Trump] coming on campus, I\u2019m upset about not being able to come and attend the event,\" Luis de La Mora, a 19-year-old sophomore at Benedict, told ABC News, adding that he was disappointed that weren\u2019t more accommodations made for the students.\n\n\"Only the most exclusive kind of people are allowed to go in,\" de la Mora said. \"For me it feels a little exploitative to say this is such a progressive move, since this is the first time Trump would be visiting an HBCU, at least our little HBCU. It\u2019s supposed to be a shining moment when the world is paying attention to our little institution, but our students don\u2019t really get to do anything about it.\"\n\nSince the kerfuffle, the school has expanded the forum to more students.\n\nIn a press conference on Friday, Benjamin told reporters he was concerned about the low amount of students who were able to attend the forum.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Sen.
