Also, under the amendments, companies will be required to disclose additional information to investors about hedging relationships they have that are directly affected by the transition from Libor. A hedging relationship usually refers to a company\u2019s connection to a type of insurance contract for an underlying asset or liability.\n\nThe changes are scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, but companies can choose to adopt them sooner.\n\nLibor, which underpins trillions of dollars of loans including home mortgages and corporate loans, fell out of favor after a manipulation scandal. It is slated for replacement in 2021, though finding a substitute has been a challenge for banks, companies, investors and regulators.\n\nIASB, which sets accounting standards in more than 140 countries, said it has begun considering accounting changes related to the potential impact that replacing an existing benchmark with an alternative could have on financial reporting.\n\nIn the U.S., public companies have had to adopt the new standard on hedge accounting, but private companies haven\u2019t. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets standards for U.S. companies, has advanced a proposal to delay the effective date of the hedge accounting standard for private companies by one year, until fiscal years starting after Dec. 15, 2020.\n\nWrite to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com", "description": "The International Accounting Standards Board issued changes to its rules on hedge accounting to provide additional relief to companies affected by global reference rate overhauls, including a planned shift away from the London interbank offered rate.", "authors": ["Mark Maurer"], "top_image": "https://s.wsj.net/img/meta/wsj-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
