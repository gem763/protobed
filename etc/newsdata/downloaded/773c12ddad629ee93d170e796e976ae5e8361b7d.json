What is that?\u201d the other responded, as the footage continues \u2014 a small circle can be seen rolling over the waves.\n\n\u201cLooks like a dude in a tube!\u201d the conversation continued.\n\nThat \u2018dude in a tube\u2019 is 20-year-old Kaysville resident, Weston Barnett.\n\n\u201cI was convinced I was going to die the entire time,\u201d Weston said, looking back on the long, cold night he spent trying to stay alive and afloat during a storm on the Great Salt Lake.\n\nThe pilots spotted Weston nearly eight hours after his kayak went down.\n\n\u201cI capsized and I was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m a dead man,\u2019\u201d Weston said.\n\nWeston and two of his friends arrived on Antelope Island on Wednesday. They had mapped out a course to visit a few islands before returning to where they started.\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, they had already kayaked 30 miles, and they were ready to keep going.\n\n\u201cAlright boys, want to see the setup? That\u2019s my tube I need to tie on, this is Ryan\u2019s [tube],\u201d Weston said as he showed their rigs in a video that he recorded of himself for social media.\n\n\u201cThis is mine since I\u2019m tactical, you guys know I don\u2019t mess around! I\u2019ve got my two jugs in here, I made a little rope cage for my other three [jugs],\u201d the video continued as he pointed the camera around to the supplies. \u201cIt should be a good day!\u201d\n\nThey were missing one crucial thing, life-jackets.\n\nDespite all the supplies, they were nowhere near prepared for what lied ahead. The group decided to turn around and head back for shore on Antelope Island, then the weather got worse.\n\n\u201cThe waves kept getting bigger and bigger and I was like, \u2018Ohhh, this is not going to be a good time,\u2019\u201d Weston said.\n\nAround 3 p.m. the strong winds and waves tore Weston and his friends apart.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know waves in a lake could get this big, honestly,\u201d Weston said.\n\nEach one was left to fend for themselves. The Utah Department of Public Safety said by 10:15 p.m., 20 mph winds had created seven-foot waves, and the temperature of the lake was dropping.\n\nWeston said one of his friends had a \u2018good\u2019 kayak and was able to power through the waves. That friend made it to shore shortly after the storm started, and around 7 p.m. called for help, not knowing where his two friends were or if they were okay.\n\nWeston was left with nothing but his tube.\n\n\u201cMy water went down with my kayak, my pack was gone,\u201d Weston said. \u201cYou go down and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh boy, I\u2019m about to die.\u201d\n\nEight cold hours later, he made it to Antelope Island on his tube.\n\n\u201cI just could see lights going back and forth on the shore,\u201d Weston said.\n\nAround 1 a.m., the nightmare came to an end -- the helicopters picked him up from there and dropped him off with search and rescue and medical personnel.\n\n\u201cApparently they heard me up in the helicopter, I was like, \u2018I must be on some next level yee yee\u2019s up in here!\u2019\u201d Weston laughed.\n\nWeston said his other friend was found shortly thereafter, floating, with just his face sticking out of the water. He had lost his kayak, supplies and his tube to the wind.\n\nNow, with spirits high and his good luck charm intact, \u201cchicks dig the mullet\u2026 it\u2019s actually not a fact, but it\u2019s good luck,\u201d Weston grinned \u2013 he said he won\u2019t shy away from the next adventure, but next time he\u2019ll make sure to check the weather first.\n\n\u201cI mean if I got invited to one next week, that wasn\u2019t on the Salt Lake, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Alright, let\u2019s tear it up!'\u201d he laughed.\n\nBoth men were rescued by 2 a.m. Friday. Weston and his other friend, who spent hours wading in the water, were both taken to the emergency room and treated for hypothermia and dehydration.\n\nhttps://fox13now.com/2019/09/19/search-and-rescue-underway-for-missing-kayakers-on-great-salt-lake/", "description": "DAVIS COUNTY, Utah -- A group of kayakers is lucky to be alive after a storm left them wading in cold water and waves on the Great Salt Lake for nearly eight hours.", "authors": ["Elle Thomas"], "top_image": "https://localtvkstu.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/promo393306634.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
