Both Orthodox and Catholic churches recognize baptisms performed by one another, along with Protestant baptisms.\n\nIn addition to her children, Kim was also baptized during her trip earlier this week.\n\nSpecial moment: Kim watched in awe as her youngest daughter, Chicago, was baptized\n\nSpiritual: Saint was clothed in white for his baptism ceremony\n\nWhile Kim was raised as a Christian and attends church weekly, it seems her parents did not have her officially welcomed into the faith, as the sacrament of baptism only occurs once in a lifetime.\n\nNew pictures from the Orthodox Christian ceremony show Kim covering her hair with a traditional head scarf, while wearing a high necked and long sleeved, full-length dress.\n\n'So blessed to have been baptized along with my babies,' wrote the reality star on Instagram.\n\nWelcomed into the faith: Kim shares picture of herself wearing a traditional headscarf for her baptism in Armenian cathedral\n\nShe walks alongside her six-year-old daughter North in the image, taken in the centuries old Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. A second image shows North also wearing a head scarf, as the six-year-old stands beside her kneeling mother for a portrait.\n\nKim's younger children Saint, three, Chicago, 20 months, and four-month-old Psalm were welcomed into the Christian faith alongside her.\n\nFour years ago, Kim and Kanye travelled to Jerusalem to have North baptised, with Khloe Kardashian there to be the youngster's godmother.\n\nOn this occasion Kanye was not present to witness his wife and children's baptism, however her sister Kourtney and her children were in attendance.\n\nFamily occasion: North witnessed the ceremony; while she was baptized four years ago, Kim's children Saint, Chicago, and Psalm were welcomed into the Christian faith alongside her\n\nIn her post, Kim referenced the historic nature of the cathedral in which the ceremony occurred.\n\n'Thank you Armenia for hosting my family and I on such a memorable trip.\n\n'So blessed to have been baptized along with my babies at Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, Armenia's main cathedral which is sometimes referred to as the Vatican of the Armenian Apostolic Church. This church was built in 303 AD.'\n\nKim's Armenian heritage comes from her father's side. The late OJ Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian was the grandson of Armenian migrants, who emigrated to the United States in the late 19th century.\n\nIt's lit: Kim and North lit candles at an altar during the ceremony\n\nPoignant: Kim, Kourtney and the kids waited patiently to be baptized\n\nCute: Chicago wore a white pintucked dress with a V-neck collar for the event", "description": "In the three photos, a priest gently immerses Saint, Psalm, and Chicago into a basin of holy water.\nKim sits close by as she watches her children take part in the sacrament.", "authors": ["Christine Rendon For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19600366-0-image-a-15_1570814202112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
