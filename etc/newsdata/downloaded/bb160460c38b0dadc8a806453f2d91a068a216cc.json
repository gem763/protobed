But as time went on, and I interviewed others like him, I came to see that my initial surprise derived from my own naivet\u00e9.\n\nIn fact, almost every time I\u2019ve spoken to a sicario, as the cartel assassins are called, or a comandante from a paramilitary crime group I\u2019ve gotten the same message: they truly enjoy what they do.\n\nThe homicide rate in Mexico has risen by almost 30 percent over the last five years, a national epidemic.
