(OK fine, one stat: 671 more home runs this year than in the previous all-time-high season.) Records smashed and reset and rendered slightly suspect. And we\u2019re no longer talking projections or on pace for, either. The 2019 regular season has come and gone and wrought an unprecedented amount of power. Or at least balls hit over the fence \u2014 how much power was actually involved is a matter of some contention.\n\nMaybe commissioner Rob Manfred will do something to revert the super-smooth, supremely symmetrical, and extra bouncy baseball back to a prior iteration that had a little less pop before next season. First, however, there\u2019s a postseason to play.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n(Yahoo illustration/Amber Matsumoto)\n\nJust a few days into October, we\u2019ve already thoroughly dismantled the adage that teams shouldn\u2019t rely on home runs to win playoff games \u2014 both because it was never true to begin with and because it is easier than ever to go yard. Home runs largely determined which teams made it to October \u2014 seven of the top eight home-run teams made the postseason, as did seven of the top eight teams at preventing home runs (free story idea: how did the Cubs make both those lists and miss the playoffs?) \u2014 and home runs will likely determine who wins it all. Baseball evolved to be this way because changes to the physical ball encouraged it, but also because it just makes sense to score as simply and straightforwardly as possible.\n\nI don\u2019t like this.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s cranky and crotchety and totally subjective (although I will now proceed to try to persuade both you and myself otherwise) to say so. Adding to the only number that matters at the end of the night with a single swing is definitely efficient. But \u2014 if you\u2019ll indulge me in a little bit of romanticism \u2014 there is no endgame for spectators, and engaging with sports is entirely optional. We\u2019re not trying to get where we\u2019re going as efficiently as possible.\n\nStreamlining all the scoring in a baseball game to include the fewest at-bats and actors and variables starts to beg the question of why we bother with the whole thing at all.\n\nConsider that in the first 18 innings of postseason baseball, the most exciting inning came when the Nationals staged a comeback in the National League wild-card game on the virtue of a controversial hit-by-pitch, a walk, a broken-bat bloop single, a hard-hit ball, an error, and a baserunning decision that was either a meaningless blunder or a bit of brilliant strategy.\n\nOf course Washington fans would have been equally thrilled, in the moment, to see their team take the lead on a long ball. But a graph of their collective heartbeats would have shown a single spike in place of a sustained period of extreme peaks and valleys (or at least I think that expresses the correct sentiment, despite my limited understanding of EKGs). Contrast that with the American League wild-card game, in which the victorious Rays scored 100 percent of their runs on homers and the whole thing was a comparative snoozefest.\n\nBaseball is long and only getting longer. Inaction reigns. A sustained rally \u2014 one that ultimately delivers on the incremental excitement of every pitch taken for a ball and every millisecond between contact and a hit falling in front of the outfielders \u2014 is the reason to experience a baseball game live and not just wait to watch the home-run highlight reel. The sureness of a home run eliminates all but a mere instant of tension. The narrative arc is short and discrete, covering only as long as it takes for the ball to travel some 400 feet and involving no one but the batter and the pitcher, and the latter only a little.\n\nIt is so clear as to seem almost an objective fact that the most dramatic single event that can occur in a baseball game is a play at the plate, which could go either way and which will be equally and oppositely ecstatic or gut-wrenching for each fanbase in the same instant. Removing even the possibility of that element from the majority of scoring in a series renders the whole game a little less alive.\n\nWhat I am describing is an aesthetic take on baseball that transcends the postseason and is ultimately a matter of personal preference. Even a persuasive argument couldn\u2019t move teams to forgo home runs in service of variety, and increased stakes only heighten the singular concern of winning.\n\nWhat I worry about for the postseason is that the home runs have become low-hanging fruit that often feel fluky instead of impressive. Nothing is ever a perfect meritocracy, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that it would be a farce for Justin Verlander to find himself costing his team a series because he\u2019s prone to giving up solo shots and overall scoring is lower in October.\n\nI want pressure to come into play this postseason. I want people to cheer for the entire time it takes to leg out a triple. I want to see a center fielder save his team\u2019s season with an incredible throw home. I want close calls that aren\u2019t just reviews of whether soft-pop flies possibly hit the high side of the outfield wall. OK, maybe I want the kids to get off my lawn, but I promise I don\u2019t mind if they bat flip on an RBI double.\n\nThis isn\u2019t actually about October; it\u2019s even bigger than that. But now is a really good time for baseball to be at its best, to showcase everything the sport has to offer \u2014 emphasis on a multitude of dynamic plays. And frankly, all the home runs are just boring.\n\nNotes from the clubhouse\n\nMax Scherzer warms up before his start in the National League wild-card game against the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday. (Photo by Patrick McDermott/Getty Images)\n\nAt the All-Star Game in Cleveland this year, I talked to Nationals ace Max Scherzer, and his concerns about how good hitters have gotten has renewed relevance now that it\u2019s the postseason \u2014 and especially in the wake of his first start in the wild-card game:\n\n\u201cI enjoy the grind so much. I enjoy trying to push myself further, trying to do more, always trying to find what my body can handle. The hardest part has been how fast the hitters can react to what you\u2019re doing. Their level of information about how you go about the game is at so much of a higher level than it was 10 years ago. The line between good or great is always shrinking.\u201d\n\nNotes from the stands\n\nIn the first edition of this column I asked if you thought 2019 was a good (regular) baseball season. Unsurprisingly, for many people, it depends on whom you\u2019re rooting for:\n\nJust a couple of years ago I was rooting for the Brewers to win the final games of the season so they could avoid the proverbial 90-loss mark. Now, a few years later, they are contending for division titles and playoff chances. Based on my experiences and history with my team, I know it won't last long, but it\u2019s so fun to enjoy it in the moment. \u2014 Cory Smarzinski\n\nI'm a Mets fan, so the regular season was anger-inducing. (In an unhealthy way!!!) But overall, as a general baseball fan, it was disappointing because the juiced ball seemed to cheapen run-scoring. \u2014 @reynoldstop20\n\nIf you didn\u2019t like the season, it was probably because of the \u201cjuiced\u201d ball (I\u2019m catering to those people with this week\u2019s column) and the disparity between juggernauts and teams that are tanking:\n\nThe scary thing is that four teams will probably win 100-plus games and four will lose 100-plus games this season. I don't know if that has ever happened where that many teams have reached the century mark. I certainly don't remember anything like that. There is no parity in baseball anymore. \u2014 Karel\n\nIt was not a great season: too many home runs, too many strikeouts, too few balls in play, too many godawful teams, especially in the American League. \u2014 Steve\n\nNo, too many homers. \u2014 @jimreilly43\n\nBut what surprised me the most was how many people thought the season was great and totally watchable simply because it was baseball with all the baseball-ness and inevitable amazing performances. It\u2019s a useful reminder that being tasked with extracting narratives is often a distraction from the visceral enjoyment most fans feel toward the sport:\n\nEvery season is different and the stories change but it is those stories that make baseball so special. Who wins and who loses might be fairly easy to predict, but the breakout star, declining superstar with a fat contract or the tragic make fans pay attention no matter who they hope will win. So for me it was a great season. Of course, the Padres winning the National League West would have been better. \u2014 Charles St. Hill\n\n1. Close races - Check. Living in an NL bubble, the Central race has been unbelievable, especially in September. A Brewers surge and Cubs collapse has kept me checking the scoreboard every night. It will likely come down to Game 162. The wild card was in reach for six teams until the last week, but home field is still up for grabs.\n\n2. Individual performances: Yeli/Beli has been as good as it gets over the last two years. Terrible the way [Christian] Yelich went out and he still might win the batting title. He had a legit shot at being the first ever 50-30 guy before the injury.\n\n3. Compelling trade deadline: Kind of. Would've been interesting to see what happened without the Giants getting hot at the worst time (for their front office).\n\n4. Breakout performers: Plenty to choose from. The Mets doing the right thing and letting [Pete] Alonso play right away. Everyone on the Yankees. Ketel Marte might win the batting title. [Lucas] Giolito went from awful to awesome. Josh Bell's first half. Shane (Not Justin) Bieber. The list continues. \u2014 Brian Cacic\n\nIt was a heart-breaking, disappointing year. But looking at the joy and excitement in other cities, the incredible statistics and records ... yes, it really has been a good year for baseball. \u2014 Tommy Downs\n\nSo although my Phillies fell way short of expectations this season, baseball is much more than being a \u201cdie hard\u201d for your team. With baseball you fall in love with the stories, a player coming out of nowhere to carry the team on his back, the rookie managers who take their teams to unseen heights! The World Series champions falling from grace as if the World Series team was no longer there, only a distant memory. So yes, baseball year in and year out will always be amazing! \u2014 Zay\n\nBaseball is always good. \u2014 Alex Prewett\n\nFor next week, tell me \u2014 at hannah.keyser@yahoosports.com or on Twitter \u2014 about which individual player in the postseason you\u2019re rooting for because you have an emotional investment in their personal story, warranted or otherwise!\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In this week's edition of The Pen, Hannah Keyser explains why baseball's record number of homers is diminishing its postseason product.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/inljx8KBauKRylhfRfJlCg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MTMuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hcv1Rydk3XJ9Fxpsr5PPag--~B/aD0yMDM1O3c9MzIwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/fb5d7340-e6b7-11e9-83d1-4d77db90d1b2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
