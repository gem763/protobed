Got to make sure we don't get on his wrong side.\n\n\"We're just going to let him do his thing. If we let the referee do his job, the game should flow.\"\n\nIt will be Garces' 11th World Cup match, and his 55th test match as a referee.\n\nGarces' assistants will be Romain Poite, also from France, and Ben O'Keeffe of New Zealand.
