For reference, the top 5 players according to BPM last season were James Harden (11.7), Giannis Antetokounmpo (10.8), Nikola Jokic (9.5), Anthony Davis (8.5) and LeBron James (8.1).\n\nWorth noting: \"Ben Simmons and Donovan Mitchell are projected to have career years. Andre Drummond and Draymond Green are expected to have bounce-back years (albeit not career years),\" according to Chase and Liu.\n\n\"Overall though, our model is definitely on the conservative side of things; it will be rare for it to predict any large jumps for players that already have high BPM.\"\n\nGo deeper: To read more about the methodology, click here.", "description": "Last year's top MVP candidates are tied at the top", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/iVxfZElexsqTrg0z00qOW9aMCck=/0x0:2400x1350/1920x1080/2019/10/22/1571719331404.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
