Will Hooley of the U.S. reacts at the end of the match REUTERS/Annegret Hilse\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 last Pool C match against Tonga on Sunday was their best chance of coming up with the single victory that distinguished their 1987, 2003 and 2011 campaigns.\n\nAlthough they got close towards the end of the Osaka clash with a typically fighting performance studded with a couple of well-worked tries, they ultimately ended up as winless as they were in 1991, 1999, 2007 and 2015.\n\nCaptain Blaine Scully was left hoping the lessons learned from defeats to top-tier nations England, France and Argentina would prove beneficial for the many players in the squad who will be hoping to be at the next World Cup in France in 2023.\n\n\u201cAll we can really do is squeeze every ounce of learning out of this experience. Hopefully, that can catapult the team for the next four years in the cycle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c(We can) continue to start from a place where we now know as a group - because there\u2019s a lot of people who will be a part of this team moving forward - just how hard it is and what it looks like to be at the top one per cent of the game.\u201d\n\nEagles coach Gary Gold was also optimistic about the educational impact of the tournament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been excellent, I think after the disappointment has died down we\u2019ll reflect and we\u2019ll have learned a lot of lessons,\u201d the South African said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unbelievably excited about the future, particularly with the Major League Rugby (MLR) competition that has now started. It has had a significant effect on the environment around our team.\u201d\n\nMLR will expand to 12 teams for the third season of professional rugby in North America next year and hopes are high it could have a long-term impact similar to that of Japan\u2019s Top League.\n\nGold, who coached Top League side the Kobelco Steelers in 2014-15, added that if the United States were to host the 2027 Rugby World Cup it would transform the sport in North America.\n\n\u201cThe minute it was announced that Japan was going to get a World Cup, the game has changed tremendously in this country,\u201d he said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis whole event has just been fantastic and I think we would be able to do a very similar job, and it would have the same effect on our game as well.\u201d", "description": "The United States finished the Rugby World Cup without a single point but there is optimism that a young squad will have been improved by the experience and that a paradigm shift in the game in North America could be only eight years away.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440582762&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D07Z", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
