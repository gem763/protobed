Love that a**. You ever done Molly [sic]?' He added: 'May do some tonight.'\n\nOrford, who met the actor after messaging him on Instagram, also claimed that Renner appeared to have set up a Snapchat account \u2013 using Ava's initials and birthdate as his username \u2013 purely to send and receive naked pictures.\n\n'[Renner] constantly sent me nude pictures and videos of him touching himself,' Orford wrote.\n\n'[He] would also frequently send me unprompted pornographic videos and GIFs.'\n\nShe added that Renner would frequently text her that he wanted to 'punish' her.\n\nOrford said that when she visited LA for a work trip in March 2017 Renner invited her to his house to meet him for the first time, and 'within the first five minutes' he introduced her to Ava.\n\nOrford said another young woman soon arrived, hugged Renner and apologized for being 'really high'.\n\nThe ex-girlfriend said after swimming in his pool together, Renner served her and Ava dinner.\n\nTwo ex-girlfriends submitted copies of text messages and wrote affidavits claiming Renner constantly sent them 'd**k pics' and nude photos on Snapchat\n\n'At that point [Renner] brought me a robe to wear that had 'Ava' embroidered on the chest,' Orford wrote.\n\n'[Renner] helped me put on the robe. [Renner] proceeded to kiss me on the neck as I was eating the lasagna he had made for me. This was all occurring in view of Ava while she ate her dinner. I felt very uncomfortable.'\n\nTwo ex-girlfriends submitted copies of text messages and wrote affidavits claiming Renner constantly sent them 'd**k pics' and nude photos on Snapchat and even dressed one of them in a gown embroidered with his six-year-old's name.\n\nLily Faget, a friend of Renner's, also said she had seen the Hurt Locker star get drunk and take cocaine while Ava was in the house \u2013 and admitted to taking part in a threesome with the star.\n\nShe claimed that she had seen Renner pass out drunk during a party \u2013 only for Ava to come downstairs and start asking for her father.\n\nFaget said in October 2018 she was drinking in Renner's hot tub with him and a mutual friend, and that the Avengers star was drunk.\n\n'At one point in the night, [Renner] and my friend and I went into Respondent's music studio and the three of us started having sex,' Faget wrote.\n\n'I left the studio (leaving my friend and [Renner] in there) and saw [Ava's nanny] Naomi sitting at the outside bar with a few men. All of a sudden I saw Ava walk into the living room next to the bar, asking for [Renner].\n\n'Naomi swooped her up and walked out of the room. I was so shocked that Ava was there and that no one told me to be mindful that Ava was in the house. 'I went back into the music studio (where [Renner] had the music on very loud) and saw that [he] had passed out. I had to help my friend pull [his] pants up.'\n\nFormer nanny Naomi Moore said the 48-year-old would get drunk every night and routinely throw loud parties that affected Ava's sleep.\n\nRenner says he is a loving and devoted father (left with Ava) but Pacheco (right) says her daughter is not safe in the Avengers' star's home\n\nShe also witnessed an incident in which he claimed to be suicidal, put a gun in his mouth and then fired it into the ceiling when she left the room.\n\nMoore also said she saw a string of women parade through the house, many of whom would talk to Ava, and some of whom appeared to be underage.\n\nShe said that Renner's alleged neglect of the child had led her to have uncharacteristic tantrums when she couldn't get his attention.\n\nMoore said she was eventually fired by the star before being asked to return but decided she couldn't do so because of the 'toxic' relationship she had developed with her former employer.\n\nAll three went on to confide their concerns to Pacheco \u2013 who was allegedly described as 'my crazy c*** of an ex' by Renner to Orford.\n\nPacheco is now asking LA Superior Court to grant her sole custody of their daughter, with Renner permitted only supervised visits.\n\nIn court papers filed on Friday, Pacheco claimed she had endured an 'abusive' marriage to Renner \u2013 caused in part by his increasing alcohol consumption.\n\nShe also claimed that Renner had wanted to get rid of her, telling a friend in a nightclub last November that he 'could not deal with her anymore, and he just wanted her gone.'\n\nPacheco also referenced the gun incident, witnessed by Moore and Faget, and accused him of bringing a string of women to his home while their daughter was present.\n\nIn the court papers, she said her daughter had referred to 'Tayler, Kelley, Natalie, Summer, Faith, Christina, Naz and Jessica' as visitors.\n\nPacheco said he also once claimed Ava would be better with 'no parents' than with her as a mother.\n\nRenner hit back in a counter-suit filed the same day, in which he claimed Pacheco is acting out of spite because she is bitter about their split.\n\nHe said he does not abuse drugs or alcohol and says he even submitted to random drug testing to prove it.\n\nThe 48-year-old also claimed Pacheco used to brag to friends about 'bagging an Avenger' and that she plans her attacks on him to coincide with the release of his movies so that she gets the publicity.\n\nThe star added that she was 'obsessed' with demonizing him.\n\nRepresentatives for Renner have been approached for comment by DailyMail.com.\n\nRenner and Pacheco married in 2014, a year after Ava was born. They separated the same year and divorced in 2015.\n\nThe former couple negotiated a custody agreement that saw Pacheco have Ava from Sunday afternoon to Thursday morning, while Renner has custody of the child the rest of the time.\n\nIn addition, Renner pays $13,000 a month in child support unless his yearly income exceeds $2.3m in which case, five percent goes to his ex.\n\nAny excess cash goes into an account set up for their daughter with the money due to be used for college fees, with anything left after that set to go to Ava once she turns 27.\n\nRenner told Playboy in 2015 that his time with his daughter is when he is happiest. 'When it's Daddy and Ava time, that's all I do,' he said.\n\n'You're talking to a guy who's really happy in his f***ing flip-flops right now with his little daughter in her pajamas running around in the house, waiting for me.'", "description": "Jeremy Renner allegedly admitted to taking the party drug molly, left cocaine strewn across his bathroom and in indulged in threesomes at his home, DailyMail.com can reveal.", "authors": ["Ruth Styles For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743882-0-image-a-8_1571147921392.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
