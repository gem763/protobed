Cory Booker slammed President Trump on Thursday, calling President Trump\u2019s urging the Ukraine leader to investigate the Biden family \u201cdespicable behavior.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat from New Jersey also termed \u201cthe revelations\u201d from the whistleblower in the Ukraine controversy \u201cexplosive.\u201d\n\nBOOKER DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT BIDEN'S UKRAINE TIES\n\nBut Booker emphasized that even though \u201cwe are in a constitutionally challenging moment\u201d with an impeachment inquiry in Congress underway, he didn\u2019t believe the White House race would become all about the Trump presidency.\n\nBooker spoke with reporters following a campaign event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire soon after an unclassified version of the complaint by an intelligence community whistleblower was released by the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning.\n\nThe unidentified whistleblower claimed that White House officials who listened to the call in July between the president and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky were \"deeply disturbed\" by Trump's requests that Zelensky investigate unsubstantiated allegations against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nBiden\u2019s son, Hunter, served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country\u2019s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama\u2019s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor \u2013 who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office \u2013 later was dismissed.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE UKRAINE CONTROVERSY\n\nThe president on Thursday called the whistleblower report \u201canother fake news story\u201d and \u201canother witch hunt\u201d by the Democrats.\n\nBooker claimed that the president was using \u201cthe highest office in the land.. for his own personal political agenda\u201d and emphasized that \u201cwe are seeing evidence of that in this whistleblower report.\u201d\n\nAnd he spotlighted that \u201cclearly there's more work to be done. There needs to be a thorough investigation.\u201d\n\nAn optimistic Booker predicted that the Republican-controlled Senate \u201cwill investigate as well\u2026there\u2019s already been shown some good bipartisan efforts to get to the truth.\u201d\n\nSlamming congressional Democrats, Trump on Thursday charged \u201cthey\u2019re going to tie up our country. We can\u2019t talk about gun regulation. We can\u2019t talk about anything. Frankly they\u2019re so tied up. They so screwed up. Nothing gets done.\u201d\n\nBut Booker \u2013 while acknowledging that \u201cthere\u2019s gonna be a lot of wind sucked off the sails\u201d \u2013 added, \u201cdo not underestimate the ability for us to get things done in Washington when\u2026we start to build relationships to get things done.\u201d\n\nBooker, emphasizing that the presidential election needed to be more than just about Trump, told Fox News \u201cAmericans are far more sophisticated\u2026 the United States is in peril, because of corruption. But we can also deal with other issues.\u201d\n\nTara Prindiville contributed to this report.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
