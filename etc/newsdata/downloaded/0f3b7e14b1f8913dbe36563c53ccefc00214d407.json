My COPD is in the advanced stage and the tests they give you - I am not hitting the targets.\n\n\"I'm absolutely exhausted. I struggle to get up the stairs.\n\n\"I struggle to get out of the house often because I struggle so much. I'm really housebound.\"\n\nDebra, who relies on three inhalers each days, says she was receiving \u00a3220 per fortnight on ESA and \u00a3300 once a month on PIP.\n\nHowever, this week the DWP asked Debra to attend a reassessment and her \u00a3300 a month has been restored until the hearing has taken place.\n\n(Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\n\nThe situation has left her suffering from anxiety and depression and she says she's never felt so jaded.\n\n\"When they stopped all my money,\" she said. \"I didn't have a thing. I just want to kill myself. I'm really, really struggling.\"\n\nA DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to ensuring that disabled people and those with health conditions get the support they\u2019re entitled to.\n\n\u201cDecisions about entitlement to ESA are made based on all the information provided, including from a GP or medical specialist.\n\n\u201cFollowing a request from Ms Barrass we are reviewing our decision to find her fit for work. She continues to receive support through Personal Independence Payment.\"", "description": "Debra Barrass, 47, has advanced emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but has been told she should get a job", "authors": ["Kali Lindsay", "Image", "Newcastle Chronicle"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DWP-story.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
