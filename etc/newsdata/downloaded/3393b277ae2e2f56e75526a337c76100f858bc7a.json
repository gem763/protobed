In classic Fred Andrews, Perry's character, fashion, he took the hit from a speeding truck, saving the woman in the process.\n\nThat woman was none other than Shannen Doherty, Perry's \"90210\" co-star and dear friend.\n\nOn Instagram, Doherty wrote, \"Tribute to Luke @thecwriverdale tonight. Miss him.\"\n\nThe image she shared showed her with the cast, grieving the loss.\n\nIn the episode, Archie picks up his father from a town nearby and July 4 festivities turned into a parade for Fred and Luke, to honor the actor and character.\n\nShowrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa took to Twitter to add details of the special episode.\n\n\"With an episode that honors our friend Luke. It\u2019s an episode that\u2019s bursting with sadness, but even more so with love,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019m humbled by the outstanding work everyone did on it. I hope you like it, Luke.
