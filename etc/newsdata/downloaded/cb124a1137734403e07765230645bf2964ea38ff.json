He defended his actions as only targeting corrupt financial institutions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t rob supermarkets or old women,\u201d he told the court.\n\nThe unnamed judge countered that Jauernik had also victimized the rank-and-file employees of the banks he robbed, including the one he shot.\n\n\u201cYou suffer from a narcissistic personality disorder, which was on display to everyone who followed the main trial,\u201d she said in her verdict, according to the Guardian.", "description": "A German man convicted of bank robbery\u00a0gave a closing statement lasting 20 hours before his sentencing Monday, according to The Guardian.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gavel_istock_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
