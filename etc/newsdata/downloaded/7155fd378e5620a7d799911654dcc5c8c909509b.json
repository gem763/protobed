Neville had a point, even if it probably didn't go down very well at either end of the East Lancs Road.\n\nA Man United win against Liverpool on Sunday won't disguise the gap between both sides\n\nLouis van Gaal's side beat their biggest rivals 3-0 that day in December 2014 to register a sixth straight Premier League win and go third in the table, but a title challenge was still well beyond United. Liverpool, meanwhile, slipped to 10th at the end of a week in which they exited the Champions League group stage with a draw against Basle.\n\nFive years on, and Liverpool's restoration is almost complete despite spending \u00a3200million less than United on rebuilding their squad. While The Dog & Duck continues to be in the doldrums, The Red Lion is roaring again.\n\nLiverpool arrive at Old Trafford as champions of Europe and leaders of the Premier League with a 100 per cent record after eight games as the quest for a first title in 30 years takes shape. One more win would see Klopp's side equal Manchester City's record of 18 in a row in the league.\n\nDefeat for United, on the other hand, could see them drop into the relegation zone by the end of the weekend. Yes, really. It would be their worst start to a season since Ron Atkinson was sacked to make way for Alex Ferguson in November 1986.\n\nUnited's clash with Liverpool in 2014 had been likened to a pub match by Gary Neville\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has been assured he will not suffer a similar fate even if United lose heavily. He stressed that he is still the right man, saying: 'I've never felt the job is too big for me. I'm confident in what we're trying to do. The improvement is there but it's about results.'\n\nHe feels this is the 'perfect game' to motivate his players, a comment that seemed to amuse Klopp.\n\n'I don't think there are a lot of teams who would love to play us at the moment,' said the Liverpool boss. 'It looks like United are the only one. I would say exactly the same if it was the other way around. This is the game that can change the world. That's how I would prepare it, so why shouldn't Ole?'\n\nThe stats don't make very pleasant viewing for Solskjaer right now, but one which falls in his favour is that he is actually two points better off than Klopp after 29 Premier League games in charge. Maybe there is a lesson in there for the United hierarchy.\n\n'Man United is a massive club and nobody is ready to wait for success,' added Klopp. 'If you'd have asked after 29 games all the people in this room, I don't think there was 100 per cent agreement that I was the perfect manager for Liverpool! But you can never compare my situation when I came into their situation now.'\n\nA victory would see Jurgen Klopp's side equal Man City's record of 18 in a row in the league\n\nOne situation that does bear comparison, however, is the injury crisis that has contributed to United's problems this season. As Klopp experienced in his early days at Anfield, Solskjaer's attempts to implement a pressing game has resulted in a spate of muscle injuries as the players' bodies adapt to the demands.\n\n'I didn't feel they had the robustness or the mentality at times,' said Solskjaer. 'We've been working really hard on conditioning. Of course, we've had injuries but maybe that's part of the process.\n\n'I remember when Jurgen came in at Liverpool, he also seemed to get a few injuries early on because of the workload and intensity he wanted his team to play with. But you don't see that any more. He can play with the same 11 every week, and we can get there.'\n\nSolskjaer hopes to have Anthony Martial back after an eight-week absence and maybe a couple more of his injured players.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer is hopeful Anthony Martial will return after an eight-week absence\n\nHe has not ruled out goalkeeper David de Gea making an unlikely return from the groin strain he sustained playing for Spain on Tuesday, but Klopp wasn't being drawn into any kidology. 'I expect their best possible line-up,' he said. 'A couple of days ago Ole said,\"No chance\" for De Gea and Pogba. Today it's a \"maybe\" and tomorrow it's \"100 per cent\"! Martial will be back.'\n\nAs if this wasn't already a big enough occasion for Solskjaer, he has invited the Norwegian monarch to be his guest at Old Trafford. It was the scene of his most famous goal against Liverpool in January 1999, a 90th-minute winner in the FA fourth round on route to the Treble.\n\n'When you sign for United this is the first one you look forward to,' he said. 'It's a chance for the players to get in the history books because if you can score a winner against Liverpool, as I did, that's always going to be with you.'\n\nIt will, but even a United win on Sunday cannot disguise how the gap has grown.", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER: King Harald of Norway may be at Old Trafford on Sunday to see Manchester United collide with Liverpool, but only one of these two can lay claim to being football royalty at present.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/21/19903342-0-image-a-45_1571431863900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
