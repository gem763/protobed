Their last two World Cup campaigns ere notable for left-field selections at outside-half and the 20-year old Romain Ntamack, who plays in the centre for Toulouse, has been chosen there ahead of the experienced Camille Lopez even though heavy rain is forecast in Tokyo this weekend.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: France team guide Read more\n\n\u201cGiven the way we have prepared, I think we are at the same level as England, New Zealand and South Africa,\u201d said Huget. \u201cWe were lagging behind England when we played them in the Six Nations this year [and lost 44-8] but the way we have pulled together since then makes makes me really positive about how far we will go in this competition.\n\n\u201cWe play England last so we have three matches to think about before then. Argentina are big opponents to start with. It is an important game and one we will be giving everything to win. It would give us the chance to really show our potential in the next two games and be ready for England.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at our backline, we have confident and exceptional players. I know there will be talk of Romain [Ntamack] starting at outside-half, but I am at Toulouse with him and know how good he is. Forget about his age, he is very mature, quick to think on his feet. We have the right balance between youth and experience and we have a little bit of craziness.\u201d\n\nHuget is one of seven players in the team who started at Twickenham. Four of them are occupying different positions, reflecting the topsy-turvy nature of their selection. France\u2019s head coach Jacques Brunel spent much of his media conference on Thursday explaining Ntamack\u2019s inclusion and why he had included four players in his 23 who had not started one of their three warm-up matches.\n\n\u201cThey have all done well in training,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been working hard on the collective factor in the last few months and we have the potential to do very well in this World Cup. We certainly believe in our chances in this pool.\u201d Asked if he would change his team if the weather forecast proved to be right \u2013 France failed to do so in the 2003 semi-final against England and lost when a dry-weather team was washed away in the Sydney rain \u2013 he replied: \u201cNo. We would change our tactics.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Argentina have a settled feel. Most of their players are with the Jaguares, the country\u2019s Super Rugby franchise, although they have opted for the Stade Fran\u00e7ais outside-half Nicolas Sanchez and the Saracens prop Juan Figallo who both featured in this year\u2019s Rugby Championship.\n\nFrance: 15 Maxime Medard, 14 Damian Penaud, 13 Gael Fickou, 12 Virimi Vakatawa, 11 Yoann Huget, 10 Romain Ntamack, 9 Antoine Dupont, 8 Gregory Alldritt, 7 Charles Ollivon, 6 Wenceslas Lauret, 5 Sebastien Vahaamahina, 4 Arthur Iturria, 3 Rabah Slimani, 2 Guilhem Guirado (captain), 1 Jefferson Poirot.
