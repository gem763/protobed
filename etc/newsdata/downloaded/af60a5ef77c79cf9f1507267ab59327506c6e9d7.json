As a Western person you have the means to turn around and say 'I don't want to have kids,' but in Eastern counties it's more of a natural consequence of being in a relationship.\"\n\nImage caption Men in both cultures rated physical attractiveness higher than financial prospects\n\nThe most common priority across both cultures was kindness, which led the way in both cultures and sexes, except in Western men, where physical attractiveness ranked higher.\n\nHumour ranked considerably higher in Western cultures, with women spending 17.3% of their budget on it and 18.4% of men, compared to just 11.1% for Eastern women and 11% for Eastern men.\n\nBut religion and chastity rated considerably more desirable in Eastern cultures, while these were of minor importance to men and women in the West.", "description": "People in Western countries are more likely to look for a partner who wants children, a study finds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0810/production/_109146020_pregnantwoman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
