We wait for them to start and then we go out and we use fire retardants in order to try and put them out,' Appel says in a video released by Stanford.\n\nThat approach has led to devastation for many.\n\nA treated sample of dried gas will smolder for a short period, but the gel will prevent the flames from spreading.\n\nThe grass begins to smoke as the gel goes into effect and eliminates the flames.\n\nThe Camp Wildfire was responsible for 86 deaths and more that 14,000 homes being burned.\n\nAnnually, more than 10 million acres are burned in wildfires across the country, and containing them costs $2 billion, not counting property damages and injury.\n\nAppel's gel prototype has been successful in preliminary tests, preventing fires in areas at high risk for fires.\n\nWHAT CAUSES WILDFIRES? 85% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans Lightning is the next most common cause of wildfires There were 58,083 US wildfires in 2018, down from 71,499 in 2017 California has more than 2 million homes exposed to wildfire risk, almost three times more than any other state Texas has the highest number of wildfires per year, with 10,541 in 2018 California had the most amount of space burned by wildfire in 2018, with more than 1.8 million acres affected\n\nIn an area with dried grass that has not been treated with the gel, the initial flames will be much taller and wider.", "description": "After last year's devastation Camp Wildfire in California, a team of Stanford engineers have developed a gel that can be sprayed across at-risk areas in advance to prevent the spread of fire.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19316562-0-image-a-2_1570225626418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
