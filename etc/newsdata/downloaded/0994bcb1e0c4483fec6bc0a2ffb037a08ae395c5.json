Since then he has grown like a champ; he is healthy and happy and finally home from the hospital. He looks and acts like a real newborn now, and even starting to get that baby chub.\n\nAnd yet I'm still a wreck. I've pumped milk for the last 2\u00bd months because he couldn't nurse and now it looks like he never will \u2014 I never had much milk and he's too used to the bottle now anyway. I finally made the decision to stop yesterday, to stop pumping and trying and stressing us both out, but now all I want to do is cry when I think about it.\n\nIntellectually, I know this is all because of his early start, that my hormones are all disordered and that isn't my fault. But I'm still feeling the loss of that possibility: the experience of nursing. How do I reconcile this? How do I mourn the loss of something that never was \u2014 so I can finally move on?\n\n\u2014 Mourning\n\nMourning: He\u2019s home and growing, yay! Those neonatal intensive-care days are harrowing for parents, we learned firsthand.\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re giving yourself a break about the nursing \u2014 intellectually at least. If anything, you\u2019re doing so too narrowly. It\u2019s quite possible you have some degree of postpartum depression and/or PTSD from your son\u2019s premature birth. It is scary and disorienting stuff, and that doesn\u2019t (always) simply go away the moment your baby is out of the NICU woods.\n\nPlease talk to your obstetrician (or son\u2019s pediatrician) about how you\u2019re feeling and ask for the names of people who counsel and/or support new mothers. Could be anything from therapy to a support group to a doula. You have lots of options, once you recognize you don\u2019t have to tough this out alone or dismiss it \u201cintellectually\u201d when your whole being is in pain.\n\nAs for the \u201closs of that possibility,\u201d please know, even when we get to enjoy something great, that experience automatically rules out some other thing that might also have been great or even greater. So we\u2019re always, always saying goodbye to something, some possibility, some other way of telling our story. It\u2019s natural to feel these losses more when we\u2019re giving up something we specifically hoped for or that most people seem to have, or when it\u2019s the result of something going wrong \u2014 but the process is the same. It\u2019s about grieving what isn\u2019t to be, then embracing what we have, and even finding advantages we didn\u2019t expect.\n\nRe: Nursing: It's totally okay to cry. I had to give up nursing my then-1-month-old and cried for days, and I'm not usually much of a crier. I went on to have twins who nursed and bottle fed for nine months. Nursing can be a wonderful experience, but you are not less of a mom if it doesn't happen.\n\n\u2014 Not Much of a Crier\n\nRe: Nursing: My situation was nigh identical to yours. Does the experience of nursing mean closeness with your child, cuddling talking, being together? All of that will be improved if you aren't stressing about one physical act you're struggling with for perfectly normal reasons.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: You guys are great.
