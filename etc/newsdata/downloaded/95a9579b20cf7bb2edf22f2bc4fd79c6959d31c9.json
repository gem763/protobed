But the only magic at play here is magnets and a magnificent execution of miniaturized robotics. This is a real Rubik\u2019s Cube that can completely solve itself while floating in mid-air.\n\nWe first saw \u2018Human Controller\u2019s\u2019 creation about a year ago which started life as an off the shelf Rubik\u2019s Cube puzzle that was invisibly upgraded with servos, electronics, wiring, and even batteries allowing it to spin any of its multi-coloured sides without any human intervention.\n\nIt was also able to automatically \u201csolve\u201d itself once scrambled, but in reality, there wasn\u2019t much logic required to pull off that trick. Since it required a human to do the scrambling manually, the electronics inside could just record every twist and turn, and they recreate them in reverse to create a colour-solved cube.\n\nThere don\u2019t appear to be any improvements made to the self-solving Cube\u2019s speed: it would still be trounced by the fastest robotic and human solvers in the world.\n\nBut thanks to some strategically positioned magnets inside (and a cleverly hidden magnetic base) the upgraded Rubik\u2019s Cube no longer needs a human to precariously grasp a corner while it performs its self-solving feats. It now gracefully floats in the air like an illusion straight out of David Copperfield\u2019s repertoire \u2014 but somehow even more captivating because you know how it works.", "description": "You\u2019d be forgiven for assuming that this video was the work of a talented animator, a visual effects artist, or an illusionist.
