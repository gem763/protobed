Let's move onto the next one.'\n\nThe group was founded at the beginning of the 19th century and covered 400 square miles in Warwickshire and Leicestershire.\n\nFootage taken at several meets over the last year shows hunt saboteurs clashing with members of the group.\n\nOne appears to show one of the hunt members and a demonstrator brawling on a country lane.\n\nIn another clip, a member of the hunt appears to make a sexual gesture using a dead goose.\n\nDavid Graham, spokesman for the West Midlands Hunt Saboteurs group - which was set up in 2013 - said the decision marked a historic moment in UK hunt history.\n\nIn one clip taking my hunt saboteurs, a member of the hunt appears to make a sexual gesture using a dead goose and flap its wing as if still alive (pictured)\n\nHe claimed: 'We have faced harassment, extreme provocation and regular violence from those associated with the Atherstone Hunt.\n\n'We've received death threats, had our tyres slashed, cars burnt out and have been hospitalized.\n\n'We have also faced a hostile campaign of police harassment from Leicestershire Police who have actively sabotaged investigations against the Atherstone Hunt whilst constantly seeking to prosecute members of our group at all costs.'\n\nHe added: 'We persevered and never backed down. Despite the regular violence we have faced our campaign has always remained non-violent.\n\n'Over the last six years we have sabbed almost every single meet of the Atherstone Hunt.'\n\nFox hunting with dogs has been banned since 2004 amid complaints by animal campaigners.\n\nFootage taken at several meets over the last year shows hunt saboteurs clashing with members of the group\n\nHowever the ban, which forbids the use of dogs to hunt foxes and other wild mammals in England and Wales, did not end traditional hunts.\n\nMany hunts now follow a scent trail instead of a fox, or work around loopholes in the law.\n\nA spokesman for the Atherstone Hunt, said: 'We are sad to report that following a hunt committee meeting on Monday, October 7 2019, a decision was made for the Atherstone to cease hunting activities for the 2019/20 season with immediate effect.\n\n'The longer-term future of the Hunt and its country is being considered with regards to a possible amalgamation or sharing of kennels.\n\n'However, the welfare of the hounds remains the priority at this stage.\n\n'Arrangements have been made to draft hounds to other packs but while they remain in kennels they are being looked after by hunt staff under the supervision of the Masters.\n\n'We would like to thank everyone and in particular our farmers and landowners for their generous support.'", "description": "Mr Packham (pictured) expressed his delight after the 200-year-old Atherstone Hunt ceased activity following six years of confrontations with the\u00a0West Midlands Hunt Saboteurs.", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/11/19533770-0-image-a-8_1570703314589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
