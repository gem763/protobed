(Alexey Nikolsky/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe United States is embroiled in an impeachment inquiry, Ukraine is scrambling to keep out of the fray \u2014 and then there is Russia, surveying it all with barely concealed satisfaction.\n\nIf any country stands to gain from the developing turmoil, analysts and politicians in Kiev say, it is Russia. And they expect President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government to exploit every opportunity it can find.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt [the Russians] will try to take advantage of this situation,\u201d said Bohdan Yeremenko, the former Ukrainian ambassador to Turkey who now has a seat in parliament. \u201cThey\u2019re masters of the under-carpet game.\u201d\n\nOn one front, Russian officials are already publicly telling Ukrainians (and the rest of the world) that the United States has proved itself to be an unreliable friend, with the release of the White House account of the embarrassing July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe disclosure changes \u201cthe format of relations between states, between leaders, between politicians,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said on Russian television. \u201cBecause now everyone understands that it is dangerous to call to Washington, to hold talks and meet with it.\u201d\n\nMore important in Ukraine is that Russia will likely use the scandal to portray Zelensky as a minor leaguer and Ukraine as an incorrigibly misgoverned country.\n\nAnd, since this is yet another Ukrainian scandal with a link to the natural gas industry, analysts in Kiev expect Russia to argue to Western European nations that it now must move forward with the stalled Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The project would send Russian natural gas to Europe, bypassing current networks via Ukraine.\n\n'Russian footprint'\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on Sept. 27 that Russia \u2014 accused of helping Trump win the presidency in 2016 and locked in a low-grade armed conflict with Ukraine in its eastern regions \u2014 may have \u201chad a hand\u201d in whipping up accusations against Kiev within Trump\u2019s circle.\n\nTrump has demanded Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as the release in 2016 of the \u201cblack ledger\u201d that implicated Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, in illegal doings here. Trump also appears to believe, on the basis of no evidence, that the hacked DNC email servers are in Ukrainian custody.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has met with an array of Ukrainian former officials and business people, including some who have a hand in gas and oil companies \u2014 which inevitably links them to Russian suppliers. Prominent among them is Pavel Fuks, who now cannot travel to Russia because of his opposition to Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine, but who says he took part in talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow in 2008. He was also banned in 2017 from traveling to the United States for five years, he said in court records, but did not explain why.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump departs after a news conference with President of Finland Sauli Niinisto in the East Room at the White House on Oct. 2, 2019 in Washington, D. C. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe do keep track of who is conducting the political struggle inside the [United States], of course, but interfering is not a good idea,\u201d Putin said Wednesday. \u201cWhy would we need that? It is against our interests, principles and the practice of Russian foreign policy.\u201d\n\nSuggestions to the contrary are \u201cparanoia, evident to all,\u201d said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, echoing Moscow\u2019s repeated denials of U.S. intelligence assessments of widespread Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other races.\n\nBut it is what Russia does now and in the weeks to come that alarms politicians and analysts in Ukraine.\n\nThere is \u201ca definite Russian footprint right now,\u201d said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, a member of Ukraine\u2019s Rada, or parliament, and a former vice prime minister for European integration. Moscow, she said, is seeking to impose \u201ca negative impact on the image of Ukraine, on the future of Ukraine, and on Ukraine\u2019s relations with the United States.\u201d\n\nRussia has an unusual ability, she said, to \u201camplify the message,\u201d not least as its \u201capprentices\u201d spread the word throughout American social media.\n\n'Weaker' the better for Russia\n\nThe Kremlin, said Grigory Frolov, head of an organization called the Free Russia Foundation, is working on a sort of trifecta. Out of this scandal, he said, \u201cRussia is interested in making Trump weaker, Zelensky weaker, Biden weaker.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Zelensky decided to endorse a plan that would lay the groundwork for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, called the Steinmeier Formula, after the former German foreign minister who proposed it in 2015. He was immediately denounced by the opposition for capitulating to Russia, which backs the plan. But Zelensky\u2019s aides later tried to make clear that many significant details still have to be worked out.\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reacts to media questions during Ukraine and Belarus forum in Zhytomyr, Ukraine, on Friday, Oct. 4, 2019. (Efrem Lukatsky/AP)\n\nUnder the proposal, elections would be held in regions now under de facto Russian control, and those regions would gain a degree of autonomy within Ukraine. Zelensky is insisting that armed forces would have to withdraw first, and that Ukraine would have to regain control of the border with Russia in those regions \u2014 but his critics fear that is only his opening negotiating position, and he may eventually agree to elections under much less satisfactory conditions.\n\nHis predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, resisted the Steinmeier Formula for three years, arguing among other things that such elections, if ever held, would be tainted by years of Russian propaganda.\n\nBut Zelensky, to show he is not boxed in by the Trump scandal, needs to keep moving, Frolov said. The president, he said, can look for little victories where he can find them. In September he arranged a swap of 70 prisoners with the Russians, something Poroshenko had never managed. Another exchange is in the offing.\n\nHe is playing a weak hand, nonetheless.\n\nLast month, Zelensky met with Trump in New York. \u201cI really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem,\u201d Trump told him. \u201cA tremendous achievement and I know you\u2019re trying to do that.\u201d\n\nThat comment, said Konstantin Batotsky, an analyst here, was \u201ca disaster\u201d for Ukraine. It signaled to Putin, he said, that the United States could not be counted on to always be in Ukraine\u2019s corner. It was worse than the phone call, he said.\n\nFiguring out Zelensky\n\nThe loss of Kurt Volker, the special U.S. envoy to Ukraine who resigned following the revelation of the Trump administration\u2019s pressure on Kiev, was another blow, Batotsky said.\n\n\u201cHe was the gamer\u201d who could have helped Ukraine find a way out of its mess, he said. \u201cThe Russians are extremely happy about this.\u201d\n\nZelensky has one trait working in his favor: The Kremlin is not sure what to make of the former comedian who played a Ukrainian president on a TV show.\n\nHe wants to achieve peace, and he seems to have no strong ideology beyond a desire for clean government. He is from eastern Ukraine and is popular there \u2014 which complicates Russia\u2019s approach. People like his optimism. Putin would rather deal with a pro-Western oligarchic president in Kiev who does little to improve people\u2019s lives, Frolov said. That kind of opponent is easy to stir up public feeling against.\n\nThe arrival of the inexperienced Zelensky, who has total control of the parliament, is not about liberals versus conservatives, Frolov said, but new versus old.\n\n\u201cAnd this is not a discussion,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Putin wants in Russia.\u201d\n\nNatalie Gryvnyak in Kiev and Natalia Abbakumova in Moscow contributed reporting.\n\nRead more\n\nRead the House Democrats\u2019 letter on State Department texts\n\nUkraine to \u2018audit\u2019 case of gas firm linked to Hunter Biden\n\nAnalysis: 3 deeply problematic aspects of newly released texts\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "One message: The U.S. can\u2019t be trusted.
