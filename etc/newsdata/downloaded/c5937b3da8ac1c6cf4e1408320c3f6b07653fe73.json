Netflix announced its decision only two weeks after Daredevil\u2019s show runner had outlined the fourth season of the series.\n\n\u201cWe are tremendously proud of the show\u2019s last and final season and although it\u2019s painful for the fans, we feel it best to close this chapter on a high note,\u201d Netflix explained. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful to our partners at Marvel, showrunner Erik Oleson, the show\u2019s writers, stellar crew and incredible cast including Charlie Cox as Daredevil himself, and we\u2019re grateful to the fans who have supported the show over the years. While the series on Netflix has ended, the three existing seasons will remain on the service for years to come, while the Daredevil character will live on in future projects for Marvel.\u201d\n\nWith those words, the single most positive portrayal of the Catholic Church in our present culture came to a sudden end. Even if Marvel decides to go with another outlet, it will most likely do so with a whole new cast and crew. If nothing else, it\u2019s a timely reminder that excellence is always fleeting in this fallen world.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\n\u201cBless me, Father, for I have sinned\u2026\u201d \u201cPerhaps it would be easier if you\u2019d tell me what you\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not seeking penance for what I\u2019ve done, Father. I\u2019m asking forgiveness for what I\u2019m about to do.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Matthew Murdock, masked in ninja attire, beats the stuffing out of an entire gang of sex slavers, freeing a number of captive women. Those are the opening few minutes of Netflix\u2019s season one, episode one of Daredevil. It\u2019s intense, brutal, and just.\n\nA child left blind by an act of charity and parentless after a mob hit on his father, Matthew Murdock grows up in a Catholic orphanage in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, New York. Eventually earning a law degree at Columbia University, he eschews corporate America and employs his legal skills to aid the poor through his small-time firm, Nelson and Murdock. Franklin \u201cFoggy\u201d Nelson, his best friend and law partner, aspires to make something of himself (meaning get rich), but Murdock\u2019s charisma and friendship brings out his best.\n\nTrue to superhero convention, Murdock did not merely lose his sight. He unwittingly traded his normal eyesight for finely honed perceptions in his four remaining senses as well as superior resistance to pain and heightened acrobatic agility. When asked if he \u201csees,\u201d he replies, and I\u2019m paraphrasing, \u201csomewhat but as though the world is on fire.\u201d When the viewer gets a brief glimpse of what Murdock \u201csees,\u201d we immediately recognize a medieval vision of the angelic, the sainted, and the holy. Halos appear everywhere.\n\nThroughout the first three seasons of the series, a number of broken people come and go. Karen Page, an aspiring journalist with all the baggage of a broken home, seems at first like a damsel in distress, but she reveals a developed sense of perseverance and intelligence beyond almost any other character in television. Foggy, though bumbling, always knows how to break the tension and bring all things back to perspective. Father Lantom, Matt\u2019s confessor, stands by Matt no matter the cost. A man\u2019s man, Lantom is a refreshingly honest priest\u2014so rarely seen in Hollywood or on the news\u2014who loves to drink and play pool. He\u2019s known Matt since his childhood, raising him as a son in his orphanage. He knows exactly what Murdock does at night in the back alleys of Hell\u2019s Kitchen and recognizes him for what he is\u2014a saint and defender of the poor.\n\nOther allies emerge when necessary. A nurse, Claire Temple (okay, that one\u2019s a bit on the nose), patches up Matt when necessary, as does a nun, Sister Maggie (Magdalene\u2014again, some obvious Catholic symbolism). An old flame, the Asian-Greek Elektra Natchios, complicates Murdock\u2019s life with her support, sexual temptation, and heroic distraction. Murdock, for his part, would do anything to bring her to salvation, but such a commitment will exact a huge toll.\n\nEven Daredevil\u2019s main villain, Wilson Fisk (Kingpin), fascinates the viewer. Plagued by extreme emotions and control issues, Kingpin wants to dominate everything and everyone around him. His deeply intelligent and passionate evil is believable and thus utterly horrifying. He has become\u2014at least in Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2014a small god, able to see the moves on the chessboard six, seven, and eight turns ahead, outwitting almost everyone around him. And those he can\u2019t outwit he murders.\n\nStan Lee, Bill Everett, and Jack Kirby first created Daredevil at the beginning of the golden age of Marvel Comics in 1964. Until the late 1970s, though, he remained a second- or third-rate character, usually supporting others, especially Spider-Man. Then Frank Miller took over the art and then the writing in the late 1970s and early 1980s (and, briefly, in the early 1990s). Miller is constitutionally incapable of producing anything but absolute excellence, and his runs on the character raised Daredevil to the top tier of all Marvel and, indeed, all comic book characters. One might readily combine the holy vengeance of Dirty Harry with the social justice of Dorothy Day when looking at Miller\u2019s Daredevil. His only competitor in the world of comics is DC\u2019s Batman.\n\nSadly, two major movies starring an effete and cheesy Ben Affleck (Daredevil) and a beautiful Jennifer Garner (Elektra) attempted to put Miller\u2019s characterizations on the big screen. They failed and, in their failure, they put the cinematic future of Daredevil in doubt.\n\nWith both the massive success of the Marvel universe in cinema and the rise of Netflix, however, Disney (Marvel\u2019s parent company) allowed for the creation of the Marvel TV universe\u2014all centered around New York and several ground-based characters (as opposed to the heroes who fight cosmic battles such as Thor and Captain America). These include Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, the Iron Fist, and the Punisher. All of them cross repeatedly into the shows of the others, with the mini-series The Defenders explaining their connections to one another. One need not watch them all, however, to enjoy Daredevil. The first two seasons are stories in and of themselves, and season three takes place a few months after the collapse of a massive complex during the series finale of The Defenders.\n\nWhen the third and final season begins, Murdock wakes up to find himself in the care of the priest and the nuns who had raised him. He, however, has lost his faith. He does not so much fail to believe in God as become convinced that God is a god who manipulates us as puppets for His entertainment. Murdock, who knows his Bible and catechism well, sees only the God who allowed the torture of Job. His loss of faith affects all around him\u2014his neighborhood, his friends, his priest, his nuns, his parish, and even his enemies.\n\nThroughout the third season\u2014only recently released\u2014Murdock\u2019s loss of faith demands the sacrifice of a number of his closest allies, all of whom believe in him, to bring him back to redemption. There\u2019s even a \u201cmurder in the cathedral\u201d moment as one of Daredevil\u2019s closet and most trusted allies dies in the name of Murdock\u2019s faith. Throughout the show, people confess, they pray, they talk theology, and they attend Mass. None of it\u2014praise the Good Lord\u2014is forced. The writers, directors, and actors have made it as believable, as complex, and as appealing as life itself.\n\nAt this point, let me throw the gauntlet down. Not only is season three of Daredevil the best of the show\u2019s three seasons, it is the best thing to appear on any screen since season one of Stranger Things, and, before that, Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight Trilogy.\n\nThere are a number of things that make this series and story so compelling. First, every person involved brings her or his absolute best to the show. There\u2019s nothing cheesy about any of this. It\u2019s deadly serious, and the result is a serious work of art. Second, Daredevil as a show never dumbs itself down. It writes for those who care deeply about this world and the next. Third, it allows the art to linger. When a conversation needs 10 minutes, the show gives the characters 10 minutes. There are few of the one-liners or cute quips that so many shows and movies have devolved into, appealing to the tapioca-brain dead mass of those demanding to be entertained.\n\nThere are also few sharp camera cuts. Indeed, the 11-minute fight scene during Matthew Murdock\u2019s escape from a prison in episode four of season three is the single finest of its type that this writer has ever witnessed, rivaled only by the failed bank robbery in Michael Mann\u2019s Heat (1995). Fans will gush over this and directors will study its 11 minutes for years to come.\n\nEven Murdock\u2019s fighting style is fascinating. He has combined the Irish boxing techniques of his father with a variety of Asian and Asiatic martial arts. When he fights, he fights close. Murdock, it turns out, can only be punched and bruised and cut for so long. Whatever his supernatural powers, invulnerability is not among them.\n\nThe Catholicism of Daredevil\u2019s three seasons is not velvet piety of EWTN. Rather, it is gritty, complex, and heroic. There\u2019s nothing that Father Lantom or the nuns do that makes the viewer cringe in embarrassment. This is the genuine Catholicism of the Jesuits entering North America, not the voluptuousness of early 19th-century Vatican Romanitas. Given all that is happening in the Catholic Church at the moment\u2014the corruption, the scandals, the lies, the manipulations, the accusations among much of the clergy and hierarchy\u2014Daredevil demonstrates what a real Catholic does in the face of adversity. He fights, he struggles, and he fights some more. When he questions his faith and goes through \u201cthe dark night of the soul,\u201d his friends intervene and pick him back up.\n\nI would love to rage at Netflix for canceling this spectacular series. Yet as my wonderfully Catholic grandmother would tell me, let\u2019s just be glad it ever existed at all. Amen.\n\nBradley J. Birzer is The American Conservative\u2019s scholar-at-large.
