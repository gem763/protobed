I eat very simply \u2014 only boiled food without oil or spices, rice and boiled daal (lentil stew) with a couple of green chillies,\u201d he said in a 2016 interview.\n\nmedia_camera Mr Sivananda with a worker at Abu Dhabi airport.\n\n\u201cI avoid taking milk or fruits because I think these are fancy foods. In my childhood I slept many days on an empty stomach.\n\n\u201cDiscipline is the most important thing is life. One can conquer anything with discipline in food habits, exercise and sexual desires.\u201d\n\nThe 157cm-tall Mr Sivananda is fit and in good health, lives independently and even travels alone on trains.\n\nmedia_camera Mr Sivananda could be the oldest man who has ever lived.

I just want people to be happy, healthy and peaceful.\u201d\n\nmedia_camera The monk attributes his long life to celibacy, yoga and simple food.
