Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) speaks at the steak fry on Saturday. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)\n\nDES MOINES \u2014 In just 24 hours, the candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination gathered to endorse a bold LGBTQ rights agenda, spoke to the largest outdoor \u201csteak fry\u201d in the party's history and watched a new poll reshape the wisdom about the caucuses.\n\nNot a whole lot really changed. Policy disagreements were minor at the GLAAD forum in Cedar Rapids: Every candidate agreed to pass the Equality Act and reinstate Obama-era protections. The weekend\u2019s big arguments were mostly imported by TV, from Stephen Colbert\u2019s questions to Elizabeth Warren about tax increases to the scandal over President Trump plying Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden. (More about that below.) But with each week, the field settles a little more, and the straggling candidates see their problems a little more clearly.\n\nThe Elizabeth Warren backlash is coming. Even before the release of the Des Moines Register's Selzer & Co. poll, which put Warren at 22 percent support to Joe Biden's 20 percent, the senator from Massachusetts had reshaped the Democratic primary. Six months ago, some rival campaigns had written her off. Two months ago, no candidate saw an upside in attacking her. But that was then, and now, Warren is the only Democratic candidate who has successfully executed her initial plan: to build massive campaigns in the early states and compete for a win in Iowa.\n\nWarren\u2019s strength was visible all weekend, from the standing ovation she got at Friday\u2019s LGBTQ forum to the friendliest audience at the steak fry. (Warren\u2019s campaign bought half as many tickets as that of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, but her speech got roughly the same response as his, and she edged him in a friendly corn kernel poll on-site.) She made two sharp moves that did not occur to other leading candidates: reading to the Cedar Rapids audience the names of trans women of color who had been killed in 2019 and starting her steak fry speech with a fresh call for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nAccording to the Selzer poll, Warren is now the most well-liked Democrat in the field, with the most first-choice and second-choice support from voters. The other 16 candidates competing for Iowa can\u2019t allow that. By the end of Saturday, Warren had taken some flack from the left, for telling the People\u2019s Action forum in Des Moines (limited to a few left-wing candidates) that she did not support a national rent control policy; Sanders does. She\u2019d gotten some blowback from the party\u2019s centrists, though they had been harsher in interviews leading up to the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe won the House back in 2018 with Democrats running on a public option, not Medicare-for-all,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said at the steak fry.\n\nThe temptation in looking at any caucus is to compare it to past years. In 2003, Howard Dean surged with liberal voters before panic set in that he couldn\u2019t win the general election. In 2015, Republicans ignored Donald Trump\u2019s rise or actively encouraged it \u2014 think of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas saying Trump was \u201cterrific\u201d \u2014 because they incorrectly believed he\u2019d eventually collapse.\n\nWarren, who has twice defended herself from attacks in debates, doesn\u2019t resemble either candidate, but there\u2019s a growing irritation at the how-she-does it media coverage she gets. Supporters of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) grumbled that she got a sterner question than Warren about their shared \u201cevolution\u201d on using Medicare money to pay for gender transition. No candidate has thrived from going after a rival, least of all by attacking Warren, but when the media's focus turns to a candidate, things can change fast.\n\nBernie Sanders is struggling. In June, when the \u201cSelzer poll\u201d found the senator from Vermont's support at just 16 percent, the Sanders campaign insisted that the pollster was not capturing the strength of its game plan. They claimed to have 26,000 \u201cvolunteers\u201d in the state \u2014 a number based on initial sign-ups when he entered the race \u2014 and to be activating voters who had never caucused before and, as such, didn\u2019t show up in public polls.\n\nSince then, the Sanders campaign has parted with its Iowa political director and deputy director, admitting what it won\u2019t say: The plan wasn\u2019t working. Sanders is now less popular with Democrats than he was four years ago. Thirty-six percent of caucusgoers view him unfavorably, when just 8 percent held that view in the autumn before the 2016 caucus.\n\nSanders has declined without making any traditional mistakes. When asked in the Selzer poll how they defined \u201celectability,\u201d a supermajority of Iowa Democrats \u2014 74 percent \u2014 said it was \u201cexciting new voters to show up.\u201d That's exactly what Sanders has been arguing for years that he can do. At the steak fry, like at every \u201ccattle call,\u201d Sanders eschewed big shows of enthusiasm to emphasize organizing. His campaign claimed to have made 26,000 phone calls and knocked 5,000 doors during the event.\n\nBut it hasn't solved Sanders's central problem: He has reactivated his donor base but hasn't reunited his electoral coalition. Refusing to attack Warren, Sanders has instead proposed policies that go further than hers, such as canceling all medical debt and imposing national rent control to stabilize housing. So far it hasn't stopped active Democrats from migrating to the candidates they like more.\n\nCory Booker is struggling and strangely happy to talk about it. Booker is one of several Democrats doing everything that Iowans ask \u2014 showing up, getting crowds, growing more popular \u2014 and seeing no benefit in polls or momentum. His campaign decided to do something about that Saturday, announcing that he would need to raise an oddly specific $1.7 million or quit the race. According to Booker\u2019s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, Iowans liked Booker but didn\u2019t realize how precarious his situation was.\n\n\u201cThey think he's fine, and they think they have more time to decide,\u201d Demissie said on a conference call. \u201cThey think that this thing is going to narrow over the coming months \u2026 but the point that we're trying to make very clearly is that the [candidates] offered to the Democratic Party come February, March, and April are being determined right now, in September. And these resources ultimately are what determines who is going to stay in this race.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s campaign claimed to have raised more than $300,000 since the do-or-die announcement, and the senator from New Jersey really is in a better position than other candidates in the single digits. In the Selzer poll, Booker\u2019s net favorable rating (the percentage of voters who like him, minus the percentage who don\u2019t) is 38 percent, compared with 36 in June. Outside the Warren-Biden-Sanders triad at the top of the polls, just Booker and three other Democrats have double-digit favorables: Harris\u2019s net rating is 39 percent, Klobuchar\u2019s is 30 percent, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is 28 percent. The race has stratified between seven Democrats who most Iowa voters generally like and nine Democrats to whom they\u2019re either negative or indifferent.\n\nTV ads haven't done much. On Aug. 8, Harris's campaign went on the Iowa airwaves for the first time. On Aug. 20, Biden's campaign joined in. And on Sept. 6, after airing a pair of radio spots about the mayor's post-partisan American Dream, Buttigieg's campaign boiled them down into a TV ad.\n\nAll three of these Democrats were flat, or had lost support, in the latest Selzer poll. Harris and Biden had seen their unfavorable ratings double over the past six months, while Buttigieg grew more popular; his strength as a second-choice candidate has been growing, even as fewer voters say he's their first choice. But the only obvious effect of TV advertising so far has been putting Tom Steyer, who has spent millions on commercials, onto the board; he clocked in at 2 percent, though more Democrats viewed him unfavorably than favorably. Big TV buys used to do more.\n\nThe \u201cvirtual caucus\u201d is dead. It didn't get much fanfare, and there was no grilled meat involved, but shortly before the weekend started, Iowa Democrats announced the solution to their years-long problem of trying to boost participation in the caucuses. The DNC rules committee \u201ctentatively\u201d approved a plan to add \u201csatellite\u201d caucus sites in 2020, where voters who have given a reason that they cannot physically attend the caucuses can be counted.\n\n\u201cEach satellite location will have a trained captain who is charged with overseeing the room, managing volunteers, and reporting the results on caucus night. The results will be reported using the same method as precinct caucus locations,\u201d the state party announced Friday. \u201cThe satellite caucuses will create one additional county in each Congressional District.\u201d\n\nThe new system will (unless it changes again) work quasi-absentee votes into the caucus count; it won\u2019t create a separate, online pool of votes for a \u201cvirtual caucus.\u201d The few polls conducted of that \u201cvirtual\u201d contest found Joe Biden, who\u2019s more popular with moderates than liberals, doing very well. Nixing it may help the campaigns with traditional grass-roots campaigns and activist energy.\n\nIsaac Stanley-Becker contributed reporting.\n\nREADING LIST\n\n\u201cSeventeen Democratic hopefuls blitz Iowa Steak Fry as the competition for votes intensifies,\u201d by Holly Bailey, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Amy B Wang\n\nThere was meat, there was rain, and there were selfies.\n\n\u201cYoung black voters to their Biden-supporting parents: \u2018Is this your king?\u2019 \u201c by Astead W.

(Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nAfter the first reports that the president might have pressured Ukraine's president to get dirt on his son, Joe Biden told reporters that Trump should \u201cstart to be the president\u201d and stop abusing his powers. The next day, at the steak fry, Biden took a question from a Fox News reporter \u2014 how many times had he talked to Hunter Biden about his \u201coverseas business\u201d dealings? Biden said he\u2019d never talked to him about it, then let rip.\n\n\u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated,\u201d Biden. \u201cHe is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate him, if that\u2019s what happened?\u201d After accusing the president of \u201cabuse of power\u201d and saying he\u2019d \u201cbeat him like a drum,\u201d Biden was asked whether the president should be impeached: \u201cDepending on what the House finds, he could be impeached, but I\u2019m not making that judgment right now.\u201d\n\nBoth the Friday and Saturday exchanges with reporters came from the same premise: Biden, campaigning to restore the pre-Trump norms of good government, was saying that Trump was breaking those norms to smear him. Other candidates might get into the mix with the president, but Biden has positioned himself as a back-to-normalcy candidate: \u201cAmerica is coming back like it used to be,\u201d like he said when he launched. His approach to the president is a mix of disappointment, disbelief and shame.\n\nNone of that gives Trump pause. On Sunday, Trump said without evidence that \u201cBiden and his son\u201d were adding to \u201cthe corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d then taunted Biden for saying he had not spoken to his son: \u201cOf course you spoke to your son!\u201d Later, on talk shows, the president\u2019s surrogates inside and outside the administration, who have brushed aside questions about actions of the president\u2019s kin, advanced the completely unproved accusations of Biden family corruption.\n\n\u201cIf it's the case that there was something going on with the president or his family that caused a conflict of interest and Vice President Biden behaved in a way that was inconsistent with the way leaders ought to operate, I think the American people deserve to know that,\u201d said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cI think the bigger story here is really what went on with Biden and his son?\u201d Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cHe came out over the weekend and said he never spoke to his son. Yet the facts are his son said they had spoken.\u201d And Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, went even further, going on Fox News to call Hunter Biden a \u201crecovering drug addict\u201d and stoke speculation that his deals in Ukraine were subjects for the former vice president to answer.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t know how this will play. But they know how similar tactics played in 2016. At that time, the president exploited voter worries about Hillary Clinton by turning any accusation he could back onto her, most dramatically by inviting women who\u2019d accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct to the second presidential debate. Clinton was hamstrung by the impression that she could not be trusted, and both she and Trump lurched into Election Day with most voters saying that they found neither of them to be \u201chonest and trustworthy.\u201d\n\nBiden, after a lifetime in politics, does not have a similar image. He famously did not get rich during his years in the Senate. Having watched anger boil over at Clinton for giving high-priced speeches, he approached his post-vice presidency career cautiously. The media reception to Trump\u2019s Ukraine gambit has been incredibly skeptical, similar to the reaction when Trump made baseless charges against Republican opponents in 2015.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s party was not united behind him then; now it is. Democrats were largely united around Hillary Clinton when Trump made his 2016 attacks; they are not united behind Biden. Only a few of his rivals have commented on the back-and-forth, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) telling the president to \u201cleave Joe Biden alone\u201d and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) kicking off her steak fry remarks by referring to Trump's actions.\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to call out this illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings right now,\u201d Warren said.\n\nBiden hadn't called for impeachment, only investigation. For nine months, the president really hasn't had much of a role in the Democratic primary; candidates have been more responsive to the left's demands than to anything Trump is saying. Attacking Biden could backfire and rally Democrats around him. In the short term, it's making him demonstrate how he'd handle the specious attacks that Trump embraced again and again in 2016. He's more able to punch back than Hillary Clinton, but his overall theory is the same: Ask voters to consider whether they really want Trump's ethics in the White House.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nEddie Rispone, \u201cOne Thing.\u201d The wealthy businessman in Louisiana's three-way race for governor has gone up with negative spots about Gov. John Bel Edwards, asking whether the Democrat has made the state less safe. While the state's GOP legislature signed off on criminal justice restructuring, Rispone has spotlighted some of the violent criminals who benefited from it to warn about consequences: \u201cCriminal justice is one thing; releasing dangerous criminals is another.\u201d\n\nTate Reeves, \u201cTough Call.\u201d The GOP nominee for governor has struggled to hold on to partisan support because of anger at his tight fiscal policies, which have made teachers mad and stoked worries about weak infrastructure. In his latest spot, Reeves continues to argue that this is an asset, marveling at how legislators went \"crazy\" about his spending cuts. \"Mississippi's got less debt today than when I got elected; first time in history,\u201d he says.\n\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox three times a week.

At this point in 2007, in this poll, 74 percent of Democrats picked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John Edwards as their first choice; the combined support for the top candidates now is 53 percent. And there are other reasons so many candidates in the doldrums see a potential comeback if the race keeps shuffling and if Joe Biden \u2014 the only top candidate not running from the left \u2014 loses more support.\n\nFor now, the poll positions Warren as the candidate with the most first-choice and second-choice support, stitching together a coalition of liberals who backed Sanders in 2016 and Hillary Clinton supporters; Sanders gets no support from Clinton 2016 voters. Looming over her is the Medicare-for-all question, and for reasons very familiar to nervous Democrats. Most caucusgoers support Medicare-for-all, with 41 percent saying they like it and just 24 percent coming out against it. The crucial swing vote: the 28 percent of Democrats who say they personally like the policy but fret that it would hurt the party in a general election. Warren leads Biden by four points with these voters, with big implications.\n\nWould you be comfortable or very uncomfortable supporting this candidate? (NBC-WSJ, 900 registered voters)\n\nDonald Trump \u2014 41/49\n\nJoe Biden \u2014 37/33\n\nElizabeth Warren \u2014 37/33\n\nBernie Sanders \u2014 36/41\n\nKamala Harris \u2014 25/32\n\nPete Buttigieg \u2014 24/24\n\nThere are years when many candidates for president are popular. This is not one of those years. This poll, which also pushes voters for answers on every major Democratic proposal (replacing private insurance is unpopular, a large immigration amnesty is not), finds that no Democratic candidate would start the election with as much active opposition as the president but that none is particularly popular.\n\nWhile Biden outperforms other Democrats in trial heats, and while his coalition does not entirely overlap with Warren's, he has about the same level of support and opposition; Sanders, who for a long time was the most broadly popular candidate, has the lowest ceiling of support. The Democratic \u201celectability\u201d conversation has not changed much recently, but the numbers have.\n\nIN THE STATES\n\nRep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.) arrives with his family Saturday to announce his Senate bid. (Josh Reynolds/AP)\n\nMassachusetts. Rep. Joe Kennedy III started his Senate campaign with a whirlwind tour of Massachusetts and nothing bad to say about Sen. Ed Markey, who he'd be replacing if he won. Markey challenged Kennedy and lesser-known opponents to a climate debate, possibly to highlight how Markey has been a left-wing leader on the issue and Kennedy has been an ally, but not a lead messenger.\n\nMississippi. Jennifer Riley Collins, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, would be the first woman to hold the office and the first black woman elected to any statewide job. But she has not been endorsed by Attorney General Jim Hood, the Democrats' nominee for governor; she has pressured Hood to endorse her, without success. Hood, the only statewide elected Democrat, has largely run on his own ticket.\n\n2020\n\nBill de Blasio\u2019s presidential campaign ended Friday, but the indignities were not over. On Sunday, Selzer & Co. released the year\u2019s third Iowa poll, with the remarkable fact that no one \u2014 no one in three polls over six months \u2014 had listed the mayor of New York City as their top choice for president. No one had listed him as their second choice, either. De Blasio\u2019s campaign ended without much praise from rival candidates and with, unsurprisingly, a gleeful New York Post obituary on the tabloid\u2019s front page.\n\n\u201cLike NYC mayors before me, I knew what I signed up for,\u201d de Blasio texted BuzzFeed\u2019s Ben Smith.\n\nWhat did de Blasio\u2019s campaign accomplish? Not much. He did not build out grass-roots campaigns in the early states, appearing instead at party events and meet-and-greets. (The worst of these, which even the mayor had to admit was funny, was a video chat appearance at the Iowa AFL-CIO meeting in which a glitch raised de Blasio\u2019s voice to an \u201cAlvin and the Chipmunks\u201d pitch.)\n\nHe had a memorable premise, that there was plenty of wealth in America but in \u201cthe wrong hands.\u201d But he didn\u2019t shift the debate on his terms like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren had; his idea of a \u201crobot tax\u201d to fight automation went mostly unnoticed.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s biggest impact came in the televised debates; he qualified for two of them, before the standards tightened in September, and he ensured that former Alaska senator Mike Gravel would not make it. (Gravel\u2019s campaign qualified for the first two debates thanks to hitting 65,000 individual donations.) In June and July, de Blasio emerged as a pugilist on Sanders\u2019s and Warren\u2019s behalf, raising his hand when asked whether he would eliminate private insurance, then aggressively defending the idea.\n\nBernie Sanders. He took another jab at Joe Biden during a Thursday event in Chapel Hill, N.C., chiding the former vice president for his fundraising schedule: \u201cJoe, we are not going to make the changes we need in this country when you go to three fundraisers in Chicago sponsored by multimillionaires.\u201d Sanders is campaigning in Oklahoma on Sunday before returning to Iowa on a \u201cBernie beats Trump\u201d tour.\n\nPete Buttigieg. The steak fry was the start of a four-day swing through Iowa; Buttigieg is traveling through the northeastern part of the states on his first campaign bus tour, through Tuesday.\n\nJoe Biden. He headed to Kansas City and St. Louis to raise money after the steak fry; Sunday he addressed striking GM workers in Kansas City. On Monday he'll attend the funeral of Emily Clyburn, the late wife of the House majority whip.\n\nElizabeth Warren. She joined striking autoworkers in Detroit on Sunday, in support of the UAW's demand for higher wages and permanent job offers for temporary employees. Earlier, Tim Ryan made a mini-road trip of strike locations, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) rallied with workers during her \u201cblue wall\u201d trip to Michigan.\n\nCOUNTDOWN\n\n... eight days until the end of the third fundraising quarter\n\n... nine days until the deadline to qualify for the Democrats' October debates\n\n... 24 days until the next DNC fundraiser with Elizabeth Warren", "description": "In this edition: A wild Iowa weekend, the Trump administration's Biden gambit, and the end of the de Blasio dream.", "authors": ["David Weigel", "National Reporter Covering Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://palomaimages.washingtonpost.com/pr2/1c1ef39c748bff4c9ec70c95dd5d1b33-4000-2667-70-8-345503908_04_tstmp_1569185664.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
