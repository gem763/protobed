The D.C. Council member is the subject of multiple inquiries looking into his conduct. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nMetro\u2019s inspector general will investigate the agency\u2019s ethics probe of former board chairman Jack Evans at the request of the House Oversight Committee, officials said Friday.\n\nThe inquiry is expected to look at evidence that Evans and former Metro board member Corbett A. Price sought to impede the investigation of Evans in the spring by the Metro board\u2019s ethics committee.\n\nThe probe by Metro Inspector General Geoffrey Cherrington adds yet another investigation to ones already underway into Evans. It appears to ensure that Price\u2019s conduct also will get a closer look.\n\nEvans is under scrutiny from the U.S. attorney\u2019s office and a law firm retained by the D.C. Council, on which Evans is a longtime Democratic member representing Ward 2. The probes focus in part on whether he used official positions to help his personal legal and consulting business.\n\nReps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) sent a letter to Cherrington requesting that he look into Evans\u2019s and Price\u2019s conduct. Cummings chairs the Oversight Committee and Connolly chairs its government operations subcommittee, which has responsibility for Metro.\n\n[Jack Evans to resign from Metro board after probe shows he \u2018knowingly\u2019 violated rules.]\n\nThey acted three days after their Republican counterparts on the committee, who are in the minority, asked that congressional staff \u2014 not the Metro inspector general \u2014 investigate Evans and Price.\n\nCherrington said on Friday that he was still reviewing the committee\u2019s request but planned to honor it.\n\n\u201cOf course we\u2019ll investigate it, but we\u2019re evaluating what our next steps are going to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue is sensitive, because Cherrington will have to be careful not to interfere with the federal probe of Evans. Metro has received two grand jury subpoenas regarding Evans, and FBI agents searched his home in June.\n\nCongress is interested in both Evans\u2019s questionable business dealings and indications that he and Price sought to conceal results of the Metro ethics investigation.\n\nAn outside law firm retained by the Metro ethics committee to investigate Evans found that he committed multiple ethical violations. But the four-member panel, deadlocked 2 to 2 on some issues, could agree only that he committed a single violation of failing to disclose a conflict of interest with a parking company.\n\n[Corbett Price, under fire for concealing ethics violation, resigns from Metro board.]\n\nThe committee drew widespread criticism for initially keeping its findings secret. That allowed Evans and Price, who was on the ethics committee, to falsely claim that Evans had been cleared. Ultimately, the findings came out, and Evans and Price resigned from the board.\n\nThe Oversight Committee obtained more than 900 pages of Metro documents in July detailing the agency\u2019s probe.\n\n\u201cThese documents paint a disturbing picture of Mr. Evans\u2019s ethical transgressions that resulted in his resignation from the Board,\u201d the letter from Cummings and Connolly said.\n\nThe documents also detail efforts by Evans and Price \u201cto impede the Ethics Committee\u2019s investigative process,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThese actions include verbal attacks and intimidation against staff and efforts to stifle the release of the findings of the Ethics Committee\u2019s investigation.\u201d\n\nThe letter asked Cherrington to \u201creview these documents and any other materials necessary for a thorough and complete evaluation of the ethics investigation of Mr. Evans\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reported in August that the documents, supported by interviews with current and former Metro officials, show that Evans threatened the jobs of the agency\u2019s top lawyer and board secretary in an effort to keep secret the fact that the ethics committee found he had committed a violation.\n\n[Metro board wants future ethics investigations to be made public, unlike in Evans probe.]\n\nThe GOP on Friday welcomed the Democrats\u2019 action but criticized them for what it called a delay in investigating Evans. Republicans have sought to portray the Evans scandal as an example of political corruption in the District and use it to undermine Democratic efforts to win D.C. statehood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re relieved that Chairman Cummings has finally acknowledged the serious, bipartisan concerns about Mr. Evans\u2019s alleged misconduct,\u201d said Russell Dye, a spokesman for the Republicans on the committee. \u201cMaybe if he wasn\u2019t so focused on President Trump, he would have taken action months ago \u2014 like Republicans did. We hope that the Chairman\u2019s engagement here is just the beginning of robust Committee oversight.\u201d\n\nConnolly\u2019s subcommittee will address the Evans scandal, along with Metro safety issues, at a hearing Oct. 22.", "description": "House Democrats want a review of evidence that Evans and an ally tried to obstruct an earlier inquiry.", "authors": ["Robert Mccartney", "Senior Regional Correspondent Covering Government", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-NBYVKxm-nX-tlF0kk-CZqi6Eoo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YBGZWNUY6YI6TGQW3RKR5JNEHM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
