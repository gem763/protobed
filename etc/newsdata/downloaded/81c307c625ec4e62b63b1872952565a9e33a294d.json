REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nHikvision was one of eight Chinese firms put on an expanded U.S. blacklist on Monday to punish Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities, in a move that has escalated tensions ahead of Sino-U.S. trade talks in Washington this week.\n\nHikvision has come under fire for allegedly supplying surveillance equipment across the province of Xinjiang, where Uighur Muslims are being held captive in detention centers.\n\nThe company, which calls itself the world\u2019s biggest maker of video surveillance equipment, has already been banned since August from selling to U.S. federal government agencies on the grounds its products could pose a threat to security.\n\nThe new U.S. measures, also directed at top Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startups SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology Ltd, bar Hikvision from buying components from U.S. companies without Washington\u2019s approval.\n\nGeneral Manager Hu Yangzhong told reporters on Wednesday it had been preparing for a possible U.S. ban for more than a year and its overall reliance on U.S. components was \u201cextremely low\u201d.\n\nHe said the company remained confident about its long-term business prospects despite being added to the U.S. blacklist.\n\nThe U.S. dominates the market for graphics processing units (GPUs) which are critical for image processing but Hu said reliance on GPUs will decrease as the AI sector advances.\n\n\u201cAll Hikvision clients can rest assured Hikvision has the ability to guarantee continued, stable supply of products,\u201d said board secretary Huang Fanghong, adding that the company would continue to expand in the United States and other markets.\n\nJohn Honovich, founder of surveillance video research company IPVM, has said Hikvision uses Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp, Ambarella Inc, Western Digital and Seagate Technology as suppliers.\n\nThe company, which has a market value of about $42 billion, is 42% owned by Chinese state investors and its two main founders. It pulls in nearly 30% of its 50 billion yuan ($7 billion) in annual revenue from abroad.\n\nHikvision temporarily suspended trading in its shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Tuesday after the U.S. announcement.\n\nHu said the company had been communicating with various branches of the U.S. government about the situation in Xinjiang, and had hired human rights lawyers to defend itself.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government doesn\u2019t care at all about the things Hikvision is doing in Xinjiang,\u201d said Hu. \u201cThe thing they care about is sanctions.\u201d", "description": "Chinese video surveillance company Hikvision will only suffer a limited, short-term hit after being blacklisted by the U.S. government and will strive to get the ban lifted, its general manager said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Samuel Shen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438803753&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980H6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
