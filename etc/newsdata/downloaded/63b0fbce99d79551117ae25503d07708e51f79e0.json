Clothing and environment can force more unconventional methods for concealment. I prefer a holster around the ankle when I cannot appendix carry. Even though it\u2019s not my first choice, ankle carry does have some perks than traditional carry methods.\n\nUsing an ankle holster like the Galco Ankle Glove is extremely comfortable. I sometimes forget that I am even carrying a gun down there. The neoprene cuff stretches so that movement is not impeded and the sheep skin pad increases comfort. I can wear an ankle holster for long periods of time without any discomfort. Extended travel in a car usually means I will be wearing my ankle holster.\n\nWith the exception of wearing skinny jeans, concealing an ankle rig is a breeze. Ankles are out of the line of sight and often not attracting as much attention as the belt line when people might be looking for guns. Printing is minimized due to the smaller guns that are carried and the compact designs of the holsters used. Ankle holsters are available for everything from revolvers to sub-compact double stack handguns, so find a model that fits a preferred ankle gun is a cinch.\n\nThe only drawback to ankle carry is the learning curve. It takes dedicated time and training (but that\u2019s true for most things!). The draw process is different for obvious reasons. Take your time when you start. This method of carrying can be valuable but the skill needs to build just like every other aspect of firearms manipulation.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Sometimes carrying a self-defense handgun inside the waistband just isnt an option. .09/02/2019 3:11:56AM EST.", "authors": ["Notebook Staff", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/22/ecaf6f2f-0170-41f5-9145-b5d36b9fd72e.png"}
