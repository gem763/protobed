Police made several arrests and used tear gas to disperse protesters, saying they used \u201cminimum force\u201d.\n\nBy Sunday night, most protesters had dispersed, but riot police remained on the streets in various districts.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said a large group of protesters threw 20 Molotov cocktail petrol bombs at Mong Kok police station in Kowloon on Sunday night. Local media said barricades outside the police station were set ablaze but police and firefighters extinguished the fires.\n\nTelevision footage showed shoppers screaming and some injured when police charged inside a mall. The protesters, many wearing face masks to shield their identity, were often supported by shoppers.\n\nIn one mall, a group of riot police, shields out front and pepper spray canisters in hand, were forced to retreat by chanting shoppers until they were outside of the mall.\n\nIn another incident, a group of 50 shoppers inside a mall faced off against riot police outside, chanting \u201cHong Kong police mafia\u201d. The shoppers cheered when police drove off.\n\nCRITICISM OF POLICE\n\nHong Kong\u2019s police, once praised as \u201cAsia\u2019s finest\u201d, have been accused of using excessive force in dealing with protesters and have lost the confidence and respect of many Hong Kongers.\n\n\u201cHong Kong used to be a prosperous city and now she has become a police state. Hong Kong is my home. We should protect her. We should resist,\u201d said a 70-year-old who gave only his last name, Hui.\n\nHe was part of a group of 60- to 70-year-olds on Nathan Road, Kowloon, who were cheering the protesters, urging them to block the road and warning them when police were returning.\n\nHong Kong has been rocked by four months of often huge and violent protests against what is seen as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the Chinese-ruled city.\n\nA shirtless anti-government protester is being prevented from confronting riot police officers during a protest at Tai Po district, in Hong Kong, China, October 13, 2019. REUTERS/Ammar Awad\n\nThe protests were sparked by a now-abandoned extradition bill but have widened into a pro-democracy movement and an outlet for anger at social inequality in the city, which boasts some of the world\u2019s most expensive real estate.\n\nThe unrest has plunged the city into its worst crisis since Britain handed it back to China in 1997 and poses the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nHong Kong is facing its first recession in a decade because of the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protests have also taken on an element of civil disobedience by residents angry at what they see as excessive force by riot police and a heavy-handed government which introduced colonial-era emergency laws to quell unrest.\n\nSmall protest rallies have included school children, office workers, shoppers and the elderly. Hardcore activists who clash with police tend to emerge later in the day.\n\n\u201cI think the police have been using their power to suppress the citizens,\u201d said resident Mary Lam, 26.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why more and more young children come out and protest against the government and the police. Those being arrested don\u2019t have human rights. This is not fair.\u201d\n\nEMERGENCY LAWS\n\nThe Hong Kong government introduced emergency laws to ban the wearing of face masks at public rallies, a move that sparked some of the worst violence since the unrest started in June.\n\nTwo people have been shot and wounded during protests.\n\nPolice have arrested more than 2,300 people since June. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said that, since September, nearly 40% of those arrested were under the age of 18 and 10% under 15, without giving the total number of arrests.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s MTR rail network, which usually carries some 5 million people daily, has borne the brunt of attacks, and several stations were closed after ticketing machines and entrances were damaged.\n\nProtesters have also targeted Chinese banks and shops with links to mainland China. A group wielding hammers damaged a Huawei [HWT.UL] store on Sunday.\n\nDemonstrators believe China has been eroding Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms, guaranteed under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula introduced with the 1997 handover.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nThe now-withdrawn extradition bill, under which residents would have been sent to Communist-controlled mainland courts, was seen as the latest move to tighten control.\n\nChina denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.", "description": "Hong Kong pro-democracy activists and riot police clashed in chaotic scenes around the city on Sunday, with police in riot gear chasing protesters through crowds of lunchtime shoppers.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440377061&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0FG", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
