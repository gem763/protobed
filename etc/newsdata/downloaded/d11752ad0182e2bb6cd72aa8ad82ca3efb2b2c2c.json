Ilhan Omar during memorial service", "language": "en", "text": "A man whose mother died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., during a memorial service held at Ground Zero on the 18th anniversary of the tragedy.\n\nNicholas Haros Jr. stood at a podium in New York City on Wednesday and read aloud a list of victims who perished in the 2011 attacks, including his mom, Frances Haros, who was 76 years old when she died.\n\nAs he addressed a large crowd gathered to remember those who were lost, Haros Jr. wore a shirt reading \"Some people did something,\" a phrase Omar came under fire for in using it to describe the attacks in March while speaking at a fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights organization.\n\n\"'Some people did something,' said a freshman congresswoman from Minnesota,\" Haros told the group, referencing Omar's words. \"Today I am here to respond to you exactly who did what to whom.\"\n\n\"Madam, objectively speaking, we know who and what was done. There is no uncertainty about that,\" he continued. \"Why your confusion? On that day, 19 Islamic terrorist members of al-Qaida killed over 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars of economic damage. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"But as to whom,\" he continued, \"I was attacked, your relatives and friends were attacked, our constitutional freedoms were attacked and our nation's founding on Judeo-Christian principles were attacked.\"\n\n\"That's what some people did,\" Haros added. \"Got that now?\"\n\nOmar's comments first went viral in April after President Trump tweeted out a video of the Muslim congresswoman speaking at the CAIR event spliced with footage of 9/11.\n\n\"CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something,\" Omar can be heard saying in the video, in between scenes of the Twin Towers collapsing.\n\nWE WILL NEVER FORGET! pic.twitter.com/VxrGFRFeJM\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019\n\n\"WE WILL NEVER FORGET,\" the president captioned the video, which has since been viewed over 11 million times.\n\nSome viewers went on to accuse Omar of belittling the tragedy, while others argued her comments were cut and taken out of context in order to be used against her.\n\nMultiple presidential candidates and members of Congress quickly spoke out in defense of Omar, including freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who slammed Trump's video as an \"outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress.\"\n\nShe also included an excerpt from the poem \"First They Came,\" which posits that the failure of many small groups to fight against the Nazis' persecution of Jews ultimately led to the Holocaust.\n\nMembers of Congress have a duty to respond to the President\u2019s explicit attack today.@IlhanMN\u2019s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress.\n\n\n\nWe must speak out.\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst they came...\u201d pic.twitter.com/ygOX1vhE9j\n\n\u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 12, 2019\n\nFollowing her return to Capitol Hill after a two-week recess, Omar, who said she received an uptick in death threats due to the president's tweet, slammed Trump's \"vile attacks\" during at a rally outside the U.S. Capitol, CNN reports.\n\n\"This is not going to be the country of the xenophobics,\" she said at the time. \"This is not going to be the country of the white people. This is not going to be the country of the few. This is going to be the country of the many.\"", "description": "A man whose mother died in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks criticized Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar\u00a0during a memorial service held at Ground Zero.", "authors": ["Alex Lasker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Kpm8vaTGUrsQ6oJNgP7WUg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1983x1301+0+401/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/30d557b0-d4c3-11e9-9f7a-01f74def405b", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
