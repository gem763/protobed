Celebrity supporters testify in high-profile settings; highly targeted, crowdfunded media campaigns aim to keep the issue in the spotlight; and viral videos, catchy slogans, and even a movement anthem and flag help magnify the message on social media.\n\nOn September 17, a panel of witnesses including Ho and pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong testified before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China in Washington, the latest in a string of public appearances for the two activists around the globe. Ho has been especially active, shuttling back and forth between Hong Kong and elsewhere to promote her message of resisting Beijing to receptive crowds, especially in Taiwan.\n\nEarlier this month in Taipei, Ho spoke and performed at the Asia installment of the Oslo Freedom Forum. Only days before, she had been in Melbourne, where she appeared in public with the Chinese dissident artist Badiucao, designer of the unofficial Hong Kong protest movement flag. In Taipei, Ho took the stage to a screaming crowd of hundreds of admirers, their phones raised to record her appeal to democratic Taiwan, whose way of life is also under threat from China. Describing the struggle of Hong Kongers, who cannot rely on their own government to counter China\u2019s narrative, Ho struck a pragmatic tone. \u201cWhen the system fails us,\u201d she said to the attentive crowd, \u201cwe take things into our own hands.\u201d\n\nWong, who rose to international fame as one of the leaders of the pro-democracy, Occupy-style Umbrella Movement of 2014, has also been busy on the diplomatic front. Prior to his congressional testimony, he stopped in Germany, urging its government to cease exporting crowd-control weapons to Hong Kong and to put human rights in Hong Kong on the agenda in Berlin\u2019s trade talks with Beijing. (China\u2019s government rebuked Germany after its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, met with Wong on September 10.)\n\nWong\u2019s German visit came after he and fellow activists visited Taiwan, where he implored the ruling party to pass an asylum law that would make it easier for Hong Kongers to seek refuge here, territory the CCP claims despite having never controlled it.\n\nAlthough neither Wong nor Ho has been appointed by the current protest movement to represent it abroad\u2014a remarkable feat of the demonstrations is that they have been largely leaderless\u2014the general consensus in Hong Kong seems to be that they are well-known names and faces who offer the advantage of signal-boosting.\n\nWhile in Taipei mid-month, Ho told me she thought of herself as a mediator or spokesperson for the movement at large. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing myself as a leader of any sort,\u201d she said. \u201cI am, on the other hand, one of the participants of this movement: I have been on the streets with these people. I have been teargassed.\u201d She added that, as a \u201crecognizable face,\u201d she saw herself \u201cas a conduit that can bring stories of these people to the world.\u201d", "description": "The city\u2019s protest movement has unofficial representatives, crowdfunded advertising, viral videos, and much else that has caught China off guard.", "authors": ["Chris Horton"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX73CL6/facebook.jpg?1569769271", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
