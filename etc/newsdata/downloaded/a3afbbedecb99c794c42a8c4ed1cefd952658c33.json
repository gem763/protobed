Fans have been counting the days to read the fifth in Kate Atkinson\u2019s literary crime series about the tough ex-soldier turned private investigator and Big Sky is well worth the wait.

Nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has dropped out of her sophomore year at Vassar and her despairing parents send her to stay with her unconventional Aunt Peg, who owns The Lily. Once there, Vivian makes firm friends with the showgirls, throws herself into their hedonistic lifestyle and learns some tough lessons.

Miller takes the legendary story of Circe, who appeared in ancient Greek texts like Homer\u2019s The Odyssey, and brings it alive for a 21st-century audience. A captivating book that races along with verve and panache.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Books of 2019\n\nKate Atkinson never disappoints and Big Sky, her fifth Jackson Brodie novel, is the standout read of the summer.
