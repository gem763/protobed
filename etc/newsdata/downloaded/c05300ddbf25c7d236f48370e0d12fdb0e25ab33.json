Feel free to keep score of who can tell the future most often or mock us as we go. Now, on to Week 3!\n\nMason Rudolph gets it done, finishes as a top-12 fantasy QB against Niners\n\nRudolph was plenty effective when tossed into the fire in Week 2, completing 12 of his 19 throws for 112 yards, two scores, and an interception that was in no way his fault. (Moncrief is a plague.) He\u2019s the guy who gets to throw to JuJu, Vance, Conner, and former collegiate teammate James Washington (see below), so the setup here is appealing. San Francisco\u2019s defense has been stingy against the pass to this point, but some of that is more about Jameis Winston\u2019s brutal opening week. The Niners allowed 35 pass TDs last season. Rudolph has a shot at a three-touchdown performance in his first NFL start. - Andy Behrens\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJames Washington goes the distance, tops 80 yards with a score in San Francisco\n\nThe speedster and elevated backup, Mason Rudolph, have a storied past. During their days in Stillwater, at Oklahoma State, they terrorized opposing Big 12 defenses, connecting frequently on explosive pass plays. That unbreakable bond carried over into NFL Preseason games and, soon, meaningful football. San Francisco's secondary has exceeded expectations, allowing just 6.5 pass yards per attempt, but envisioning Washington breaking loose from Richard Sherman or Ahkello Witherspoon on a long TD seems inevitable. - Brad Evans\n\nSteelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and receiver James Washington have the rapport to surprise in Week 3. Mandatory Credit: Philip G. Pavely-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMarquise Brown is a top-10 receiver\n\nStory continues\n\nBrown\u2019s rookie season was expected to start slowly coming off an injury and without much preseason work, but instead, he\u2019s racked up a team-leading 18 targets while leading the NFL in yards per route run by a mile. Moreover, the wideout ranks top-10 in air yards, target share and WOPR, with the latter\u2019s leaderboard looking like this: 1) Keenan Allen 2) DeAndre Hopkins 3) Michael Thomas 4) T.Y. Hilton 5) Marquise Brown 6) Odell Beckham. Brown possesses the biggest speed advantage this week in a highly favorable matchup against Kansas City that sports easily the highest total in Week 3. Hollywood\u2019s ECR is WR28, but he\u2019s top-10 on my board this week. - Dalton Del Don\n\nCarlos Hyde does more than flex in Week 3\n\nOver the past two weeks, Carlos Hyde has seen his snap count (from 37% in Week 1 to 61% in Week 2) and rush attempts (from 10 in Week 1 to 20 in Week 2) grow. The clear favorite on early downs and near the goal line, Hyde has amassed at least 85 yards in back-to-back weeks. He\u2019s also been given three red-zone rushing opportunities. In a dynamic offense that features electric downfield weapons and a dizzyingly mobile QB, the 29 year old has faced light fronts nearly 54 percent of his carries. That\u2019s part of the reason he\u2019s repeatedly ripping off runs over 15 yards and evading numerous tackles (4.5/game).\n\nExpect more of the same this Sunday when he takes on a Chargers defense that Football Outsiders has ranked 23rd in power success percentage and that\u2019s given up the fifth-most rushing yards (297) so far this season. He\u2019s a low-end RB2 for fantasy purposes. - Liz Loza\n\n[Play in Yahoo\u2019s NFL $500K Baller. $10 entry fee and $50K to first place]\n\nPanthers passing offense ends up fine, QB1 clears 18 points\n\nIt\u2019s about panic time in Carolina after Cam Newton\u2019s hideous performance in Week 2 followed by news of a setback with his injured foot. All signs point to second-year backup Kyle Allen starting in Week 3. While that\u2019s troubling on the surface, it might not be a death blow to Carolina\u2019s passing game. For starters, the matchup is still right. The Cardinals are pushing the ball through the air and giving up yards on their end, as well. Arizona is allowing 8.0 yards per pass attempt and is the 24th ranked pass defense by Football Outsiders DVOA. Also, Kyle Allen showed well enough in taking out a depleted Saints team in Week 17 last year with a 111.3 passer rating en route to a win. The Cardinals personnel isn\u2019t much better than the unit New Orleans fielded that day.\n\nWith the volume both D.J. Moore (27% of the targets) and Curtis Samuel (No. 8 in the NFL with 259 air yards) are getting, they can still pay off with solid fantasy days despite the quarterback change. Both Panthers wide receivers can clear 80 yards and/or score a touchdown while Kyle Allen cashes in with 18-plus points. Either way, it\u2019s good to be a life-long 49ers fan! - Matt Harmon\n\nIto Smith makes his move\n\nAll of last year, I was convinced Ito Smith was the classic JAG, no one to get excited about. He looks like a different back this season. More importantly, Devonta Freeman looks slow, indecisive. And we all know about Freeman\u2019s injury history.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s offensive line could be a problem; the Falcons aimed to improve the unit, but they\u2019ve hit snags. And I can\u2019t promise you Smith will be playable this week. But the goal with FAAB and waivers is to be a week early, to buy at the bottom of the pricing structure, not at the top. And given the bankability of Atlanta\u2019s passing game, I still expect some running back here could be privy to easy yards, as opponents focus on stopping the outside threats.\n\nBottom line, I\u2019d like to get some Smith stock before the price spikes and the case becomes obvious. Freeman is someone to short. - Scott Pianowski\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Our analysts reveal their boldest Week 3 predictions, including Mason Rudolph finding success in his first NFL start.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5rSiUoTv8kmuoKn8SttiNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MzguNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/578iYHIbfg7sRS0nqohBMA--~B/aD0yMjAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f90cf420-daf1-11e9-86c7-1966b3108149", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
