We can\u2019t sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don\u2019t innovate,\u201d he argued.\n\nSee also: Zuckerberg is getting grilled in Washington as bitcoin is getting grilled on Wall Street", "description": "The bitcoin price has seen a crazy past 36 to 48 hours after China\u2019s president backed block chain technology development .", "authors": ["Clive Mckeef"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM357_arends_ZG_20190627143144.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
