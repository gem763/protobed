It was the hotel which kept us up to date,\" he said.\n\nMr Shapps, who earlier attended an emergency Cobra government meeting on the government's response, said: \"People will experience delays, we're not running the original airline, but we intend to get this done all in the next two weeks and then end this phase of the rescue.\"\n\nHe also stressed people should not come home early from their holidays but should \"carry on and leave on the date they were supposed to leave, having first checked the Thomas Cook website before leaving for the airport\".\n\nThe government has said that customers will be brought home \"as close as possible\" to their booked return date.\n\nIt has estimated the efforts to get people back home, the UK's biggest peacetime repatriation exercise ever, could cost up to \u00a3100m.\n\nThe firm's collapse has also put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, 9,000 of them in the UK.\n\nWhy are the directors under scrutiny?\n\nTop directors at the holiday company have been paid a combined \u00a320m in salaries and bonuses since 2014.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson questioned whether directors should pay themselves \"large sums of money\" as their businesses go \"down the tubes\".\n\n\"I think the questions we've got to ask ourselves now [are]: How can this thing be stopped from happening in the future?\n\n\"How can we make sure that tour operators take proper precautions with their business models where you don't end up with a situation where the taxpayer, the state, is having to step in and bring people home?,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Passengers are facing queues and disruption, from destinations such as Majorca\n\nMs Leadsom said the official receiver's inquiry would look into the conduct of the firm's top directors.\n\n\"I ask that the investigation by the Official Receiver looks, not only at the conduct of directors immediately prior to and at insolvency, but also at whether any action by directors has caused detriment to creditors or to the pension schemes,\" Ms Leadsom wrote in her letter to the Insolvency Service.\n\nThe service has the power to disqualify people from serving as company directors for up to 15 years if it finds them guilty of misconduct and can pass information to criminal enforcement bodies in the most serious cases.\n\nLabour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said Thomas Cook bosses should pay back any bonuses they had received.\n\n\"I think they need to really examine their own consciences about how they've brought this about and how they themselves have exploited the situation,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser said he was \"deeply sorry\" about the firm's collapse and said the company had worked \"exhaustively\" to salvage the deal.\n\nHow will holidaymakers get home?\n\nAll Thomas Cook holidays are now cancelled.\n\nCustomer can seek compensation via the government's Atol scheme, or from their credit card or insurance companies.\n\nCustomers seeking information can visit the CAA's special Thomas Cook website.\n\nThose scheduled to return to the UK within the next 48 hours or who are having problems with their accommodation or need special assistance can ring 0300 303 2800 in the UK or +44 1753 330 330 from abroad.\n\nImage caption Thomas Cook planes have been impounded at Manchester Airport\n\nCustomers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to be posted on a dedicated website as soon as they are available.\n\nThe DfT added that a \"small number\" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs.\n\nThe CAA is also contacting hotels accommodating Thomas Cook customers, who have booked as part of a package, to tell them that the cost of their accommodation will be covered by the government's Air Travel Trust Fund and Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).\n\nWhat about Thomas Cook's international operations?\n\nFor now, Thomas Cook's Indian, Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries will continue to trade as normal.\n\nThis is because, from a legal standpoint, they are considered separate to the UK parent company and are not under the jurisdiction of the UK's Official Receiver.\n\nThey do, however, share services - such as aircraft and IT - with their parent company and will need to strike rescue deals in the coming weeks to keep trading.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nThomas Cook had secured a \u00a3900m rescue deal led by its largest shareholder Chinese firm Fosun in August, but a recent demand from its banks to raise a further \u00a3200m in contingency funding had put the deal in doubt.\n\nThe holiday company spent all of Sunday in talks with lenders trying to secure the additional funding and salvage the deal, but to no avail.\n\nThomas Cook has blamed a series of issues for its problems, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.\n\nWhile the company was closing shops to try and cut costs, it still had more than 500 outlets, bringing large costs compared to online competitors.\n\nIn another sign of its slow progress in mending its finances, it only stopped dividend payments to investors in November.", "description": "The government says the official probe into Thomas Cook's failure must look at bosses' actions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07p42t8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
