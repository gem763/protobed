This is the best smartwatch \u2014 a bummer for Android users. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nThe Apple Watch is hands-down the best smartwatch out there. There, I said it. It\u2019s a boring conclusion that is nevertheless the cold, hard truth. You can prefer a round face, or a different operating system. You can scream about better battery life and third-party watch faces until you die, purple-faced from asphyxiation. The Series 5 still reigns king. That\u2019s true even if this time around, most of the updates are small tweaks rather than game-changers.\n\nApple Watch Series 5 WHAT IS IT? Apple's latest smartwatch with an always-on display PRICE $649 for GPS-only; $799 for mobile coverage. Bags of money for premium materials like titanium and ceramic. LIKE Adds women's health. WatchOS 6 and iOS 13 updates are solid. LTPO screen is impressive engineering. NO LIKE You still need to charge every night\n\nNow that\u2019s out of the way, if you have an Apple Watch already, there\u2019s not a huge reason to upgrade unless yours is on the verge of dying. (Or if you feel like burning your money in a bonfire.) I say this because you can get most of what makes the Series 5 great by downloading WatchOS 6. That includes new features like women\u2019s health tracking, noise monitoring, the tip calculator, the new on-wrist App Store, compass, and some updates to Siri \u2014 who despite everything, is still the worst of the three major voice assistants.\n\nThe most compelling reason to shell out $649 or more for a Series 5 would be if you want an always-on display. It\u2019s not a new feature in the smartwatch world, nor is it unique to Apple. Plenty of Android watches introduced always-on display modes ages ago, and Fitbit just did it with the Versa 2. That said, the Series 5's always-on display does it better.\n\nPart of that is the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) screen. In simple terms, the screen can refresh at a rate that varies from 1Hz to 60Hz. To ensure that the always-on display doesn\u2019t eat into battery life, Apple\u2019s also tweaked its sensors to be more power-efficient, and watch faces have a \u201cdimmer\u201d mode when you\u2019re not looking directly at the watch.\n\nFor example, the new Meridian face switches from white to black when you\u2019re not looking at it and eliminates the animation for the second hand. I should note, however, the always-on display watch faces aren\u2019t a monochrome bore like it is with the Versa 2. You still get to view complications, and there\u2019s still a flash of colour depending on the watch face.\n\nThe other part is Apple\u2019s keenly aware that everybody\u2019s a busybody. True story, seeing an errant message pop up on an Apple Watch was how a friend of mine caught a cheating significant other. While you can still get notifications and view complications, Apple also includes a \u201cHide Sensitive Complications\u201d option in the watch\u2019s settings.\n\nWhen your wrist is down, it\u2019ll hide notifications you don\u2019t want other people possibly seeing out the corner of their eye \u2014 things like emails, messages, heart rate and calendar events. It\u2019s a small touch for sure, but one that might matter depending on your job or situation.\n\nEach watch face has an \u201calternate\u201d version for the always-on display. This is the low-power version of the California watch face. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nIf you\u2019re worried the always-on display could muck up a night at the movies or your sleep, don\u2019t. Apple told me another change with the Series 5 is the ambient light sensor. It too is always on now. Meaning, if you\u2019re lying in bed trying to sleep, it can tell the lights are off and will dim accordingly. I tried it. It works, and there\u2019s always theatre mode if you want to play it safe.\n\nPersonally, I found the always-on display to be neat but not necessary in my day-to-day. I chalk it up to years of reviewing smartwatches \u2014 the wrist flick is just second nature now. That said, I can see how this might be good for new smartwatch owners accustomed to their analogue watches.\n\nThe thing I found it most useful for was running. Not because it was great in direct sunlight \u2014 it\u2019s not \u2014 or for glancing at my stats from my peripheral vision. (I don\u2019t know how you run, but it\u2019s awkward trying to look at your watch without raising your wrist.) It\u2019s useful because the display is already on, meaning there\u2019s no lag when you flick your wrist to wake the watch up. The stats just get brighter and easier to see. It always takes me out of the zone when I have to whip my arm up multiple times to check my pace, so this was a welcome change.\n\nThis is what the always-on display looks like when you\u2019re using an app. Privacy, man. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nAs for battery life, you still have to charge every day, but you don\u2019t have to pack a charger in your bag. The always-on display does guzzle more battery compared to previous models, but not in a noticeable way. On a day where I picked the watch up off the charger at 8am, walked the entirety of the Bronx Zoo, and got home around midnight, the Apple Watch still had about 30 per cent battery left.\n\nOf course, how much you get off one charge will depend on how heavily you use LTE, Bluetooth, and GPS. For reference, a 30-minute GPS run with the always-on display zapped about 20 per cent of my battery, but by bedtime, I still had 36 per cent left. I didn\u2019t get anywhere near the 36-ish hours I got with the Series 4, but as long as you\u2019re ok charging every night you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nThe always-on display doesn\u2019t do well in direct sunlight. But because it\u2019s always on, there\u2019s no lag in waking up the watch while you\u2019re mid-exercise. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nThe other hardware upgrade allows the Apple Watch to make emergency calls in other countries. Data will still depend on what deals Apple has with international carriers, but the idea is if you have a bad fall, the watch can call emergency services for you. You will most likely never need this feature, but hey, it\u2019s there.\n\nThat\u2019s really it. Accuracy-wise, the Series 5 delivered the same results as the Series 4 during a 3km GPS run. That\u2019s to say it slightly underreported distance (3km) compared to my phone\u2019s GPS, while heart rate was well within 5 beats per minute of a Polar H10 chest strap. So again, unless you absolutely must have that LTPO screen or fancier titanium or ceramic materials, upgrading isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nI downloaded WatchOS 6 to my Series 4, and it\u2019s fine. You might experience some minor lag with an older model \u2014 like the Series 2 \u2014 but a millisecond or two of latency isn\u2019t going to kill you. You also might notice worse battery life with certain apps from WatchOS 6, but before you run to the Apple Store, do yourself a favour and download the update and sit with it for a week. If the performance really is unbearable, the Series 5 isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nNoise monitoring is not exclusive to the Series 5; you can get it by downloading WatchOS 6. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nAs for WatchOS 6 and iOS 13's health updates, they\u2019re solid but more passively iterative than mind-blowing. The on-wrist App Store is long overdue, but like all wrist-based stores, limiting. Browsing for apps is hard on a small screen, even with a dedicated Featured apps section \u2014 but that\u2019s not a problem unique to Apple. Downloads are easy, but some will require your phone nearby. The Compass app will probably appeal to hikers or the perpetually lost, but it\u2019s not the most exciting feature to write home about.\n\nNoise monitoring works, but its utility is more long-term. For instance, most people will know when they\u2019re in a loud environment so a notification telling you \u201cHey, you\u2019re in a loud place right now\u201d is kind of pointless. While testing, I walked past a blaring ambulance that registered 105 decibels on my watch. I knew it was loud and bad for my ears, so the accompanying notification was redundant.\n\nMore interesting is going into the Health app to look at your noise exposure level over the course of a week or month. A week in New York City, for example, netted me an average noise exposure level of about 75 decibels for a duration of 76 hours and 48 minutes. This is probably more useful for people whose jobs may result in hearing loss, like musicians. For me, it\u2019s something I can tuck in my small talk arsenal for the next time someone asks me what I do for a living.\n\nCycles Tracking, however, is a welcome change. I\u2019ve only spent about a week or so with it, but I\u2019m tempted to use it as my main period tracking app. It\u2019s got a clean design and logging from my wrist is easier than on other smartwatches. It\u2019s also a nice touch that you can opt in or out of fertility or sexual activity logging, as well as choose how prominently that information is displayed in the Health app itself.\n\nBoth are sensitive bits of information that despite Apple\u2019s privacy promises, are things women might want to keep to themselves or at least away from nosy subway riders. Apple also gets points for including text discouraging users from relying on its fertility window predictions for contraception \u2014 a low bar, but one that some women\u2019s health apps fail to clear. My one quibble is like so many period apps out there, there\u2019s no option to log certain contraceptive options, such as the NuvaRing or birth control pills.\n\nCycles Tracking is one of the easiest apps for logging from your wrist. (Photo: Victoria Song, Gizmodo)\n\nLikewise, the new Health app is a marked improvement. Navigating between menus takes some getting used to, but the new Highlights section is useful context. It is weirdly motivating to see that say, by 10:30am, I am 3,000 steps behind my daily average. Or that I\u2019m averaging fewer exercise minutes this month than last month (23 minutes a day in September, versus 25 minutes a day in August). It\u2019s definitely not as advanced as the companion apps for a Polar or Garmin smartwatch, but it\u2019s better at tracking your trends over time than Fitbit.\n\nSmall improvements are still improvements. The Series 5 might not represent a major shift in the same way the Series 4 did, with its bigger screen and ECG capabilities, but it is the more comprehensive watch. And given the lack of serious competition, it\u2019s not like Apple needs to rush with how many features it adds each year.\n\nEditor's Note: The ECG functionality is not operable in Australia, as we've detailed here.\n\nIt\u2019s free to coast on incremental improvements for the foreseeable future because right now, every other smartwatch maker is still playing catch up in quality and breadth of features. Except for battery life. But if all I can harp on is battery life \u2014 a thing most Apple Watch users seem to be ambivalent about anyway \u2014 then what is there really to complain about?\n\nREADME", "description": "The Apple Watch is hands-down the best smartwatch out there.
