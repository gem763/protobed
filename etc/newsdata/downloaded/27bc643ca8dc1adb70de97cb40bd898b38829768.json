Crosthwaite. Juul, which is facing broad regulatory pressure, will also reduce its marketing budget and focus instead on \u201cearning a license to operate in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d said Crosthwaite. (Wall Street Journal)\n\nTalking point: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to enact regulations banning e-cigarette companies from selling certain flavoured products; they\u2019ll also need to apply for FDA approval before selling their products in the U.S. Juul, the market leader, has tried getting ahead of the laws by pulling candy-, dessert- and fruit-flavoured \u201ce-juice\u201d and halting federal lobbying efforts against the FDA\u2014a measure that could be hurting its growth in the short term. Health Canada is also reviewing its vaping regulations after a rise in vaping-related lung injuries in the U.S. So far, it\u2019s business as usual for Juul in Canada, despite public health groups calling for an immediate ban on flavoured products, which accounted for about 80 per cent of the company\u2019s sales this year.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
