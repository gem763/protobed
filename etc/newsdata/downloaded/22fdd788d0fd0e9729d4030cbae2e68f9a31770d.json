We call on all the Governments of the sovereign states of the members of the United Nations for their recognition of the de jure and exile Government of the Manipur from today onwards. \"The three million Manipuri people want recognition as one of the Precious Native Nations. Our attempts to engage with the Indian government were met with hate and hostilities,\" they claimed. They claimed there are \"more than 1,528 cases of the extrajudicial killing which are pending before the Supreme Court of India\".\n\nThe duo claimed the \"State of Manipur is a de jure Government formed in Manipur under the Manipur State Constitution Act 1947. It received independence from the British Raj on August 14, 1947. They claimed the sovereign State of Manipur was excluded from India by the Order in Council by his Majesty on 27 December 1946 and the Indian Government annexed the Manipur State of India by the violation of the Act 1949\".\n\nHowever, Leishemba Sanajaoba, the king of Manipur on Tuesday issued a statement distancing himself from the development.\n\nIn a statement, he said he was made to sign some documents by these representatives on the pretext of acquiring some Manipur-related documents and pictures from London, adding that he is unaware of the declaration.\n\nHis Highness the King of Manipur has issued statement distancing himself from the announcement.

If this is accepted, many in Manipur fear that their state, which is already the smallest in the country will be further bifurcated.", "description": "Two Manipuri men who claim to represent the titular King Leishemba Sanajaoba have announced the setting up of what they called the Manipur Government in exile in the UK.
