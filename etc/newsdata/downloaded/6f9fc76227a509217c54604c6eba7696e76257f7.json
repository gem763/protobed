This could be a negative for sterling.\"\n\nThe pound fell 0.14% to $1.2841 in Asia on Friday. For the week, sterling was on course for a 1.18% decline versus the greenback, its biggest weekly decline since Sept. 27.\n\nSterling fell 0.1% to 86.49 pence per euro ( ), on course for a 0.45% weekly decline.\n\nOpposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would wait to see what the EU decides on a Brexit delay before deciding on a general election.\n\nHowever, Corbyn also repeated he could only back an election when the risk of Johnson taking Britain out of the EU without a deal to smooth the transition was off the table.\n\nThe euro ( ) held steady at $1.1103 in Asia on Friday, on course for a 0.62% weekly decline.\n\nThe Ifo economic institute's closely-watched measure of German business sentiment due later on Friday is expected to weaken slightly in October, highlighting fears that Europe's largest economy is slipping into recession due to the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit.\n\nThe European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday after unveiling a big stimulus package last month, but there are concerns the ECB's firepower has largely been spent.\n\nThe ( ) against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 97.688 but up 0.42% on the week. The U.S. currency held steady at 108.61 yen , on course for a 0.18% weekly advance.\n\nThe focus shifts next week to a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting ending Oct. 30 and a Bank of Japan meeting ending Oct. 31.\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates for a third time this year, but fixed income analysts say this is largely priced into the market.\n\nThe BOJ is leaning toward keeping policy on hold next week, but the decision is a close call as policymakers struggle with the fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.", "description": "Sterling falls on election uncertainty, traders eye EU meeting on Friday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9O00Q-OCABS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
