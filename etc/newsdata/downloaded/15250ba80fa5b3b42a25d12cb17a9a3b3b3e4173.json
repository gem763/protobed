Under pressure for most of the session, the market staged a strong move into the closing bell. Stocks seemed to take their lead from the 10-year yield, which rallied more than 5.0% and has now rallied 28 basis points (bps) off the September 4th low to 1.744. The 2-year yield is just 1.688.\n\nThe Dow and S&P closed at the high of the session, and other big-equity indices closed near their intra-day high point.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average rallied almost 200 points to close at 26,909\n\nS&P 500 closed at 2,979\n\nNASDAQ Composite closed at 8,084, just missing the high of 8,086, but above the opening print of 8,049\n\nInternals Impress\n\nAs impressive as the close was for the market, the internals were even more ebullient as the market breadth was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nMarket Breadth NYSE NASDAQ New Highs 1,712 2,006 New Lows 1,218 1,128 New Highs 82 48 New Lows 10 42 Up Volume 2.83 billion 1.45 billion Down Volume 1.54 billion 910 million\n\nDoes Market Smell a Deal?\n\nOver the last few days, there has been an intriguing mix of poor economic data and overtures from China, which lends hope to the notion there could be good news on the way.\n\nWall Street doesn\u2019t expect a deal before the election, which would make positive news even more impactful.\n\nThese overtures include removing foreign investment restrictions and an offer for an increase in agriculture buys. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced it removed the $300 billion overall cap on overseas purchases of Chinese stocks and bonds.\n\nIt should be noted that only $111 billion in funds have been used in such purchases through August 30, so it\u2019s unlikely there is pent-up demand. That said, even symbolic overtures should be considered an olive branch these days. Coupled with pulling the extradition rule in Hong Kong and agreeing to meet with the U.S. on trade, it\u2019s compelling.\n\nI get there was news and a big event in the case of Apple (AAPL), but I don\u2019t think cheap iPhones moved those shares. There is accumulation, and I think it has everything to do with potential positive news.\n\nBoeing (BA): +3.0%\n\nCaterpillar (CAT): +2.4%\n\nJohn Deere (DE): +3.6%\n\nApple (AAPL): +2.2%\n\nEveryone\u2019s Eating Better\n\n\"And I'm eating, but I'm still thirsty\"\n\n-Kanye West\n\nThere\u2019s more evidence the same tide lifts all ships as we got Household Income & Poverty data for 2018 from the Census Bureau.

INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term. We have the great currency, power, and balance sheet....\n\n\u2026The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn\u2019t allow us to do what other countries are already doing.
