I would have no choice but to take it up,\" he said. \"How long you're on it is a whole different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up, based on a Senate rule on impeachment.\"\n\nIn a historic move last week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that House Democrats were moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed the dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,\" Pelosi said. \"Therefore, today I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n\"The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution,\" Pelosi said. \"The president must be held accountable.\"\n\nPelosi likely has the votes to impeach Trump, but two-thirds of the Senate is needed to convict and remove Trump from office. As it stands now, with Republicans in control of the Senate, that is not likely to happen.\n\nThe fast-moving developments came amid new questions about whether Trump had made millions in military aid to Ukraine contingent on President Volodymyr Zelenskiy agreeing to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nLeah Millis/Reuters\n\nTrump, who said previously he was concerned about sending aid to Ukraine because of his allegations of corruption, gave a new explanation Tuesday, saying he had ordered the aid frozen -- before the call -- because he was unhappy with how much European countries were contributing to Ukraine.\n\nHe has always said there was nothing wrong with the call he made to Zelenskiy.\n\nIn her formal announcement late Tuesday afternoon, Pelosi said the Trump administration blocking the whistleblower complaint from being sent to Congress was a \"violation of the law\" and said Trump calling on a foreign leader to interfere in a U.S. election was \"a breach of his constitutional responsibilities.\"\n\nThe intelligence community\u2019s inspector general found that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was \"credible\" and of \"urgent concern.\" That complaint was released to the public last Thursday, ahead of acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire\u2019s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on his handling of the complaint.", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said the Senate would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to take up impeachment if the House were to pass articles of impeachment.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/mitch-mcconnell-gty-jef-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
