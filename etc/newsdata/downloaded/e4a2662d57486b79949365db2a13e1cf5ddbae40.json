He said he started to feel alone.\n\nPHILADELPHIA 76ERS' MIKE SCOTT APPEARS TO GET INTO FIGHT WITH EAGLES FANS\n\n\u201cSo one day, I wrote a note and went to the parking lot of the Palace. I had a gun rack, and I had a gun in my car. I had it in my hand,\u201d Rodman told Bleacher Report. \u201cBut for some reason, I played this music. I put it on, and I was listening to this song and this music, and I was just debating. It didn't have anything to do with basketball. It had to do with this love that I wanted, and it suddenly just left me.\n\n\u201cAnd this song came on. It was Pearl Jam. \u2018Even Flow\u2019 and \u2018Black\u2019 and stuff like that. And I had the gun in my lap, and next thing you know, I fell asleep listening to Pearl Jam. Then I woke up, and all the cops and everyone was there. I didn't know what was going on. I totally forgot I had a gun in my hand. They got me out of the car. That was pretty much what it was. It wasn't about the game of basketball. It was about feeling betrayed, because I wanted to be loved so much in my life.\u201d\n\nRodman lamented the fact there weren\u2019t as many options to get help then as there are in today\u2019s NBA. He told Bleacher Report that if he had the same options, he wouldn\u2019t have gone that far.\n\nDUKE PROBE FINDS NO EVIDENCE NIKE PAID ZION WILLIAMSON\n\nCraig Sager, the late NBA broadcaster, also revealed in 2016 in an interview with Sports Illustrated that he had a helping hand in stopping Rodman. He told the magazine he tracked Rodman down at a strip club and was certain he was going to commit suicide.\n\n\u201cHe had the gun. He was going to do it. I told him how stupid that would be,\u201d Sager said.\n\nAt the time of Sager\u2019s death, Rodman thanked him for helping save his life.\n\nRodman played for the Pistons from 1986 to 1993 before moving on to the San Antonio Spurs and then playing with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe won five NBA championships over his career and was selected to the All-Defensive team eight times.", "description": "Basketball Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman opened up about his suicidal debate in 1993 while he was a member of the Detroit Pistons.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
