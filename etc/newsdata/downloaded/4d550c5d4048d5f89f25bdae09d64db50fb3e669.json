They call me to fight, I come to fight. I was ready. They called me. I said I\u2019d take it. They said it\u2019s this Saturday. I said that\u2019s fine. They said it\u2019s at a catchweight. I said, \u2018What weight?\u2019 They said, \u2018175.\u2019 I said that\u2019s fine. And now I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nDespite having competed in a losing effort against Goiti Yamauchi just three weeks ago, Awad had no reservations about making such a quick turnaround.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in great shape,\u201d Awad said. \u201cI took one week off and let my body kind of relax from the weight cut and everything. Then I jumped back in it that following week. I trained throughout the week and felt really good. I felt like I never missed a beat, because I really didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBellator 232 takes place at Mohegan Sun Arena.
