REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Illustration\n\nIn a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio said Chinese-owned apps \u201care increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury secretary heads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews mergers and stock purchases to ensure they do not harm national security. Treasury said it does not comment on specific cases.\n\nRubio said there was growing evidence that TikTok in the United States was censoring content that is \u201cnot in line\u201d with the Chinese government.\n\nChina \u201cis using these apps to advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nA U.S. TikTok spokeswoman said the company stores all of its U.S. user data in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government does not request that TikTok censor content, and would not have jurisdiction regardless, as TikTok does not operate there,\u201d she added.\n\nLawyers said a CFIUS review of such a deal would be unusual for the panel, which has increasingly flexed its muscle to stymy Chinese investment in sensitive U.S. industries but has shied away from using censorship to justify reviewing deals.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be shocking, but it would be atypical,\u201d for CFIUS to review a transaction over censorship concerns, said David Hanke, an attorney with Arent Fox who helped craft a legislative overhaul of the committee last year. \u201cIt also would not be the first time CFIUS has blazed new trails over China-specific concerns,\u201d he added.\n\nThe 1950 law establishing CFIUS does not limit the definition of national security. However, another attorney who declined to be named said CFIUS would likely flag critical technology or the acquisition of sensitive personal data if it took up the deal.\n\nByteDance is one of China\u2019s fastest growing startups. It owns the country\u2019s leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok, which has attracted celebrities like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry along with legions of U.S. teenagers.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chinese ownership and sudden spike in popularity have raised concerns among U.S. lawmakers.\n\nRubio has become increasingly outspoken in his hawkish stance on China. He slammed the National Basketball Association this week for expressing regret over a deleted tweet by Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey in support of Hong Kong protesters. He has also urged the Trump administration to bar exemptions that would allow us tech companies to sell to China\u2019s blacklisted telecoms giant Huawei.\n\nCongress cannot compel CFIUS to review individual cases, but the powerful committee does have jurisdiction to review deals that were not previously flagged to CFIUS by the parties involved.\n\nChinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd (300418.SZ) earlier this year agreed to a request by CFIUS to sell popular gay dating app Grindr, which it had owned since 2016.\n\nKunlun drew U.S. ire after it gave some Beijing-based engineers access to personal information of millions of Americans such as private messages and HIV status.\n\nByteDance bought Musical.ly for nearly $1 billion (818.9 million pounds) in December 2017. It later shuttered Musical.ly and moved users to a revamped version of its own TikTok app, which serves non-Chinese markets.\n\nMusical.ly, released in 2014, and TikTok, launched in 2016, both enable users to create and share short singing and dancing videos that are set to well-known songs, with numerous special effect filters.\n\nThe company\u2019s original app Douyin is similar to TikTok but is only available in China and complies with local censorship requirements.\n\nByteDance counts venture firm Sequoia Capital and big private-equity firms such as KKR, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers, sources have told Reuters.", "description": "Senator Marco Rubio on Wednesday asked a U.S. national security panel to review TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co's acquisition of Musical.ly, arguing TikTok is used by the Chinese government to censor politically sensitive content.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438989610&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981OD", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
