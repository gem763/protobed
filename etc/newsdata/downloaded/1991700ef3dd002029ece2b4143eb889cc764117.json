UPDATE 1-HSBC pulls European shares lower; luxury stocks in focus\n\n* HSBC set for worst day since Feb 2017\n\n* Trade deal hopes lift auto, mining stocks\n\n* Luxury stocks gain as LVMH bids for Tiffany\n\n(Updates prices, adds comment)\n\nBy Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Agamoni Ghosh\n\nOct 28 (Reuters) - European shares retreated on Monday as a\n\nglum profit outlook from the region's largest lender HSBC offset\n\ngains in trade-sensitive sectors buoyed by positive developments\n\non the U.S.-China trade front.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.2% at 0935\n\nGMT with the banking index leading the losses.\n\nAsia-focused lender HSBC slipped 4% to the bottom\n\nof the benchmark index after it dropped its 2020 profit target,\n\nand said it would undertake a costly restructuring as the bank\n\nstruggled amidst a slowing global environment.\n\nAnother disappointment among banks was Spain's Bankia\n\n, down 3%, after the state-owned lender posted a 23%\n\ndrop in third-quarter net profit as it struggles to increase\n\nmargins from lending because of ultra-low interest rates.\n\n\"HSBC did cite weakness, but that's not massively unexpected\n\ngiven what's going on the wider growth dynamics,\" said Will\n\nJames, senior investment director, European equities at Aberdeen\n\nStandard Investments.\n\nDefensive plays like utility and telecom\n\nstocks lost between 0.4% and 0.7% as appetite for riskier\n\nsectors rose on the day.\n\n\"Earnings have so far not been a disaster, so we are not\n\nseeing massive moves,\" said James. \"From the ongoing underlying\n\nrotation, it appears that markets are repositioning and dumping\n\nsome of those defensive stocks.\"\n\nGerman stocks outperformed, lifting the\n\ntrade-sensitive auto sector to its highest level since\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials said they were \"close to\n\nfinalizing\" some parts of a trade agreement, raising hopes that\n\nthe two countries would call a truce on their long-running trade\n\nwar that has roiled financial markets. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the U.S. Federal\n\nReserve's meeting later this week for more clarity and support\n\nfrom the world's biggest central bank to aid a slowing economy.\n\nLUXURY LIFT\n\nLuxury stocks stood out after Louis Vuitton owner LVMH\n\nmade a bid to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co TIF.N\n\nwith a $14.5 billion acquisition offer. Shares of the French luxury goods maker rose and boosted\n\ngains in peers Swatch , Pandora and Salvatore\n\nFerragamo .\n\nLuxury companies continue to show resilience with a host of\n\ncompanies beating earnings expectations last week, including\n\nGucci owner Kering , as Chinese shoppers continue to\n\nspend heavily on luxury goods.", "description": "UPDATE 1-HSBC pulls European shares lower; luxury stocks in focus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB970WT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
