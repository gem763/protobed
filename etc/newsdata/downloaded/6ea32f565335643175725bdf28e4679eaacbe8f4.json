In the past, on my worst days, my anxiety would be tied to my depression/grief/co-dependency, so it\u2019s hard to say what specifically was caused by the anxiety. Nowadays, I either fight back tears if I\u2019m at work or cry if I\u2019m at home. I usually want to lie on the couch and scroll through my feed. When I need to run an errand or get chores done, I tell myself to get off the couch. That it won\u2019t take long to run the errand or do the chore. That I\u2019ll feel accomplished. That the sooner I get it done, the sooner I can get back to lying on the couch and scrolling through my feed. But I can\u2019t because it feels as though some outside force is holding my body down.", "description": "\u2018Sometimes what\u2019s going through my brain is just scribbles\u2019", "authors": ["Kena Nicol"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/gZp5DpYu9lIT4tJdZpMmVsWCz2o=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NESL5RQQGVBKRI6W2FWVXO7VIY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
