REUTERS/Juan Medina\n\nIn unusually tense confrontations, protesters threw cans, stones and flares at riot police, and set garbage containers and cardboard on fire in the middle of several central Barcelona streets, including a thoroughfare housing designer stores and the local stock exchange, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\nFences were on fire next to La Pedrera, one of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi\u2019s most famous buildings and one of the city\u2019s main tourist attractions.\n\nPolice charged several times through the crowd with batons. A spokesman for the regional Mossos police said they were trying to make space around the local headquarters of the Spanish government. Four people were detained, the spokesman said.\n\nReuters reporters saw police fire foam projectiles at the protesters. They also witnessed Spanish national police firing blanks in the air from rubber bullet guns. Police could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nCatalan government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo, speaking on Spanish national broadcaster TVE said separatists have proven they are peaceful and only an isolated group behaved violently, sullying their reputation.\n\n\u201cThe regional government condemns all violent actions as we always have done,\u201d she said.\n\nCatalan separatism has long prided itself on being a peaceful movement and its leaders say that has not changed.\n\nBut there were concerns in Madrid that heavy jail sentences for the separatist leaders could unleash pent-up frustration among a radicalised fringe, a senior parliamentary source told Reuters last week.\n\nPolice also charged protesters in the cities of Girona and Tarragona, TV footage showed. Catalan police warned people on Twitter not to approach the epicentre of protests in Barcelona and Girona for safety reasons.\n\nThe leader of Spain\u2019s centre-right Popular Party, Pablo Casado, on Twitter called for acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to activate the national security law and take control of Catalonia\u2019s security forces to \u201cguarantee security and public order\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, Spain\u2019s acting government said it will guarantee security in the region, without elaborating further.\n\n\u201cA minority is trying to impose violence in the streets of Catalan cities,\u201d the statement said, praising coordination between regional and national police.\n\nThousands of demonstrators had taken to the streets of the regional capital earlier in the evening. Some lit candles and chanted \u201cFreedom for political prisoners.\u201d\n\nPro-independence leaders have vowed to keep pushing for a new referendum on secession, saying Monday\u2019s prison sentences strengthened the movement.\n\nOriol Junqueras, who was given the longest sentence of 13 years for his role in organising the 2017 referendum which was ruled illegal, told Reuters in his first interview after the sentence that it would only galvanize the independence movement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop thinking what we think, ideals can\u2019t be derailed by (jail) sentences,\u201d he said, adding that a new plebiscite was \u201cinevitable\u201d.\n\nDemonstrators had blocked railways on Monday and thousands descended on Barcelona\u2019s international airport, where some clashed with police. An airport spokesman said 110 flights were cancelled on Monday and a 45 more were cancelled on Tuesday.\n\nTwo years after the debacle of the first plebiscite, Catalonia\u2019s independence drive still dominates much of Spain\u2019s fractured political debate, and will likely colour a national election on Nov. 10, Spain\u2019s fourth in as many years.\n\nSlideshow (33 Images)\n\nSpain\u2019s main parties have consistently refused to hold an independence referendum in Catalonia, although the acting Socialist government says it is open to dialogue on other issues.\n\nDiana Riba, wife of convicted leader Raul Romeva, told Reuters the independence drive would prevail over time.\n\n\u201cThis is a very long process, but we will see results as we did with the feminist movement, how they grew until becoming massive and achieving the rights that they were seeking,\u201d she said, calling for \u201ceveryone to take to the streets.\u201d", "description": "Clashes between protesters and police erupted late on Tuesday in Barcelona, in a second day of rallies against the jailing of nine Catalan separatists by the Supreme Court over their role in a failed bid to break away from Spain in 2017.", "authors": ["Joan Faus", "Marco Trujillo", "Jordi Rubio", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441215022&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1SD", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
