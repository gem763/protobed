After two years you would have saved \u00a312,000 and earned \u00a3180.88 in interest.\n\nIf, however, you overpaid your mortgage by \u00a3500 every month for 12 months, your equivalent saving in interest on the debt would be more than you could earn on the top paying instant access account.\n\nA borrower paying 2 per cent on a typical mortgage of \u00a3150,000 over 25 years would pay \u00a3635.78 a month, for example.\n\nIf you paid an extra \u00a3500 a month on to your mortgage debt, the loan would be reduced by a further \u00a36,055, giving you a return of \u00a355 on your \u00a36,000 saving.\n\nAfter two years, you would have overpaid \u00a312,000 on your mortgage, and reduced your debt by \u00a312,232, giving you a return of \u00a3232.\n\nAnna Bowes, co-founder of Savings Champion, says: \u2018It has never been more important to make your cash work as hard as possible.\n\n\u2018While saving into one of the best easy access accounts doesn\u2019t appear to reap huge rewards, if you were to leave your money in a poor paying account with a High Street bank the outcome would be even more dire.\u2019\n\nThe HSBC Flexible Saver, for example, is paying just 0.15 per cent before tax so you would earn \u00a34.88 in interest over 12 months, and \u00a313.88 over two years.\n\nDavid Hollingworth, of mortgage broker L&C, says: \u2018Overpaying a mortgage can be very effective because of the higher rates of interest payable on a loan but your cash will not be easily accessible.\n\n\u2018In many cases it could require the borrower to remortgage in order to withdraw their savings if they are needed ahead of selling the property.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep some rainy day funds that are easy to access or you could consider an offset mortgage where the cash can be held in an attached savings account.\u2019\n\nAn offset deal is a mortgage with an attached savings account. Any savings deposited in the account do not earn interest but are offset against the mortgage, lowering the amount of interest on your debt but still giving you easy access to your cash. Offset mortgage rates are typically higher than standard deals.\n\nIt is also important to check you will not incur any early repayment charges by overpaying your mortgage, says Mr Hollingworth.\n\nThese can be substantial if incurred, but most lenders offer some flexibility, typically allowing overpayments of up to 10 per cent of the outstanding balance each year.\n\nmoneymail@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Rates have been low for more than five years since the Government offered the banks a cheap source of cash which meant they did not need to offer decent interest rates to attract savers' deposits.", "authors": ["Samantha Partington For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
