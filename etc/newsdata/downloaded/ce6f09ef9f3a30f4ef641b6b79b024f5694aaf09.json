Chief executive Jes Staley has long fended off calls to ditch the investment bank, insisting that a diversified strategy would be best for shareholders. With 40% of revenues in dollars, Barclays is protected against Brexit turmoil and the pound\u2019s weakness, unlike its peers Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\nStaley said: \u201cThose questions around the bank\u2019s strategy have become a thing of the past. \u201cThe American firms are exceptionally good at what they do, but we have demonstrated that we can compete.\u201d The investment bank pulled in fees of \u00a3688 million for advising on deals including the London Stock Exchange\u2019s purchase of Refinitiv and Ovo Energy\u2019s bid for SSE\u2019s retail arm.\n\nThe strength in banking helped total revenues rise 8% to \u00a35.5 billion, well ahead of City expectations. The shares rose 2% to 170p. Last night Barclays ditched a controversial plan to stop its customers from withdrawing cash at Post Offices after an outcry from MPs and the Daily Mail. Staley said the shift to digital banking meant few customers were angry, but admitted the bank may have misjudged the wider mood.\n\nProfit before tax for the quarter fell 83% to \u00a3246 million due to a \u00a31.4 billion provision for dealing with last-minute payment protection insurance claims. Staley said an \u201cavalanche\u201d of claims, most of them spurious, has kept 10,000 staff busy opening envelopes. The latest\n\nset-aside takes Barclays\u2019 total PPI bill to \u00a311 billion. Ian Gordon at Investec said Barclays is now the \u201cbest of the bunch\u201d, and the only UK banking stock worth buying. Nicholas Hyett at Hargreaves Lansdown said: \u201cIt\u2019s just one quarter, but this is exactly the picture Jes Staley wants to paint. A resilient UK bank is cutting costs and keeping bad loans to a minimum, generating a reliable income stream. Meanwhile, the corporate and investment bank is putting the icing on the cake.\u201d\n\nStaley said there are signs of Brexit-related caution from personal and corporate clients, with cash balances rising. \u201cM&A is fairly soft,\u201d he said. \u201cStrategic decisions at board level are restrained, so there is clearly an economic impact from the uncertainty around Brexit.", "description": "BARCLAYS enjoyed a record third quarter at its investment banking arm as the UK lender more than held its own against Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
