The customers were mostly working in Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) establishments in the country.\n\n\u201cWe also arrested 20 customers. We will also charge them for taking advantage of these Chinese women who are victims of human trafficking,\" said Eleazar.\n\nPolice also confiscated some P1.8 million cash believed to be the earnings of the spa for that day.\n\nThe establishment does not have any permit to operate from the local government unit.\n\nEleazar said the operation was an offshoot of the operation in Makati City on September 4 wherein seven Vietnamese women were rescued while two Chinese nationals who were responsible for the prostitution den were arrested.\n\nThe Manila Wellness Spa has 37 rooms, including seven VIP rooms.\n\nThose who operate the spa reportedly charge P9,000 to P21,000 per Chinese sex worker.\n\n\"I was able to interview the Filipino utility workers and they told me that they would clean each room five times a day,\" said Eleazar.\n\nHe said at least seven Filipino utility workers are employed in the spa. They also served as witnesses.
