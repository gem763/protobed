(Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)\n\nDon\u2019t expect a particularly harsh winter, but a volatile one. That\u2019s the essence of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s winter outlook, released Thursday.\n\nThe agency is forecasting warmer-than-average temperatures over a large part of the nation, in keeping with recent trends. Winters are warming up because of climate change, and the overwhelming majority of recent years have tended to be mild on balance.\n\nBut even with winters trending milder, they have still unleashed brutal cold snaps and blockbuster storms, and there\u2019s no reason this year won\u2019t be different.\n\nThe temperature forecast\n\n\n\nNOAA winter-temperature outlook.\n\nMost of the nation is favored to be warmer than normal, but \u201ccold weather is anticipated and some areas could still experience a colder-than-average winter,\u201d the outlook said.\n\nAreas least likely to be cold, relative to average, are Alaska and Hawaii, where the outlook highlights high chances for above-average temperatures. Abnormally warm oceans surround both of these states, which have experienced record-breaking temperatures at times since the summer.\n\n[Inside Hawaii\u2019s wild summer of broken high-temperature records]\n\nThe sea surface temperatures in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off the north and northwest coasts of Alaska were, by far, the warmest of record this past summer, due in part to very early sea ice loss. #akwx #Arctic #SST H/T @Climatologist49 @CinderBDT907 @ajatnuvuk @amy_holman pic.twitter.com/at5JH9EjeJ \u2014 Rick Thoman (@AlaskaWx) October 15, 2019\n\nThe Upper Midwest, which endured a brutally cold second half of winter last year, is the only part of the Lower 48 where above-normal temperatures are not favored. Instead, the outlook calls for equal chances of below-, normal and above-normal temperatures.\n\nThe precipitation forecast\n\n\n\nNOAA winter precipitation outlook.\n\nNOAA\u2019s outlook paints a sprawling zone with elevated chances for above-normal precipitation from Montana to the northern Mid-Atlantic. Within this zone, it\u2019s especially likely to be wet in the northern plains and Upper Midwest. These areas also had a very wet second half of winter last year, which led to historic spring and summer flooding, and the situation could repeat next year if this forecast is correct.\n\nDrier-than-normal weather is favored in parts of the Deep South and central California, where NOAA is calling for the onset of drought conditions.\n\nOcean temperatures are abnormally high off the California coast, forming a zone some scientists have referred to as \u201cthe blob.\u201d Although some scientists have attempted to link this warm water with elevated chances for drought in California, Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, told reporters Thursday that he\u2019s unconvinced.\n\nThe blob \u201cusually doesn\u2019t play a large role in climate outcomes over North America,\u201d he said.\n\nHalpert made clear that NOAA\u2019s forecast for drought in California is based on computer model forecasts, not the high offshore temperatures.\n\n[The \u2018Blob\u2019 is surging back in the Pacific, leading to fears of mass die-offs of marine life and unusual weather patterns]\n\nForecast challenges\n\nHalpert stressed that predicting how the winter will play out is especially complicated this year. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no strong climate signal such as El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a. When these signals are present, they tend to favor particular patterns of temperature and precipitation in North America.\n\n\u201cWithout either El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a conditions, short-term climate patterns like the Arctic Oscillation will drive winter weather and could result in large swings in temperature and precipitation,\u201d Halpert said.\n\nHalpert said these short-term climate patterns typically take control of conditions for periods of about two to four weeks and are difficult to predict far in advance. Figuring out their net effect on the flavor of the winter is thus \u201ckind of tricky,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the absence of longer-term signals, Halpert said NOAA is relying more heavily on computer model forecasts this year. He said above-normal precipitation in the north-central United States was one of its more consistent predictions.\n\nHistorical accuracy\n\nSeasonal outlooks do not have the same degree of accuracy and reliability as day-to-day weather forecasts. Halpert said NOAA\u2019s winter temperature outlooks typically provide a 30 to 35 percent improvement over a random guess, while precipitation outlooks offer only about half that much improvement.\n\nLast year, NOAA\u2019s winter temperature outlook was worse than a random guess, largely because temperatures plunged in February in the Plains and Mountain West after mild weather had been expected.\n\n[NOAA\u2019s winter temperature outlook was worse than a random guess.
