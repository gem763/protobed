But when Amma (Eliza Scanlen) and Camille (Amy Adams) begin to slowly succumb to the Munchausen by proxy inclinations of their mother (Patricia Clarkson), the makeup becomes an integral co-star. They\u2019re sweating and throwing up that force-fed \u201cmedicine\u201d onto their nightgowns. Their eyes are cocooned in dehydrated despair. Their skin is begging for Cr\u00e8me de la Mer. They are, simply, dead women walking, unless the spoonfuls of poison stops.\n\nMichelle Radow, who was the show\u2019s makeup department head, and her team \u2014 comprised of Erin Rosenmann, Kate Biscoe, Adrien Morot, and Mark Garbarino \u2014 have all been nominated for an Emmy for their work, and they\u2019ll find out if they reign supreme in the Limited Series or Movie\u2014 Non-Prosthetic category in a matter of days. Until then, Radow was nice enough to chat with us about crafting all of Sharp Objects\u2019 \u201cpoisoned\u201d looks for the women and how it doubled as a master class in makeup subtlety.\n\nCompared to a normal look or glammed-up look, what are your first steps for a poisoned aesthetic?\n\nWith my particular style of makeup, I never want it to come off obvious. There\u2019s nothing worse than watching a film or TV show and the makeup taking you out of it. That\u2019s what I strive for, and that\u2019s always the most challenging part of creating those looks. You\u2019re always trying to make the makeup look invisible. Viewers may look at something like that and say, Oh, that looks like nothing. I bet that\u2019s easy. In reality, it\u2019s exactly the opposite. We\u2019re doing many tests, we\u2019re testing many techniques \u2014 airbrushing, products, what\u2019s going to sink into the skin the best.\n\nWhat questions run through your mind while testing?\n\nCan we put a sheen on top of it? What\u2019s going to look like the most realistic sweat? How many hours has a person been injecting the poison? What type of poison is it? Me and my team all worked together to what that would look like in the timeline and how long they\u2019ve been ingesting poison. In the script we get some hints, like, Camille took the hardest hit with the poison, because she wasn\u2019t used to Adora\u2019s poisoning over a period of time, like Amma was. It\u2019s all those things you take into consideration.\n\nSo do you always measure the success of the looks by their subtlety?\n\nYeah, it always making it look invisible to the audience. Often my family and friends will watch a project I worked on and go, \u201cWell, what did you do?\u201d And then I\u2019ll launch into a complete recap of everything that was required. And they\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d That\u2019s a compliment to me, when someone says it looks like nothing. To me, I take that as great \u2014 it looks 100 percent authentic.\n\nCan you walk me through the process on how these poison looks are created?\n\nFirst, I look at the script and break it down scene by scene, taking into consideration where the state of poisoning is in relation to the episode before and the episode after. I\u2019ll talk to the script supervisor to get her expertise of how much time has gone by. Whether it\u2019s an hour, two hours, or a full day. I have to cross-reference and double check and have my timeline in place before anything else gets done. Then, we approach the makeup. Essentially it\u2019s like any other makeup application \u2014 we prep the skin, we moisturize. With Eliza we would do a few layers with silicone makeup to lighten her skin. At her most poisoned, we lightened her skin by two levels. We used sponges and brushes to blotch it onto her skin in different layers. Then we\u2019d go back in with alcohol-based colors and ripped sponges, with blues and reds, to give her skin a marbleized look. We\u2019d go back in around her eyes with different cream colors and different shadows. We\u2019d add a little bit of sheen, too.\n\nDid you have any go-to products for Sharp Objects in particular?\n\nI often used Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream or Aloe Gator Sunscreen. It\u2019s a clear sunscreen, and we figured out that when you dab it on with a sponge, it looks like a very realistic sheen or sweat. It was actually perfect for the Georgia weather \u2014 the actors didn\u2019t get burned! We ended up using it a lot in the show with many characters. In between scenes we\u2019d spray water on Eliza\u2019s chest and face, too. We\u2019d up the level of intensity for what we needed. Revlon Colorstay was good for Eliza\u2019s body and chest to help pale her out. I\u2019m one of those artists who thinks makeup is makeup. I should probably take that back, but it\u2019s all pigment and color.\n\nIf you find an eye shadow that works for bruises under the eyes or if you find a cream that doubles as a lipstick, and it\u2019s safe to use on the face, go for it. It\u2019s all just in the application and placement of it. There was one specific challenge for Sharp Objects, too, with the lighting. Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\u2019s shooting style is so unique \u2014 he doesn\u2019t use traditional light. He uses whatever source of light is there. If there\u2019s just a hallway light on, that\u2019s it. That makes it very challenging with the makeup, since you need to be on set to adapt it to the lighting.\n\nTime-wise, is creating this type of makeup more laborious than an average beauty look?\n\nIf we weren\u2019t doing Eliza\u2019s full arms and legs, it\u2019s about the same length of a beauty makeup application. It\u2019s anywhere from 30 to 40 minutes of someone sitting in my chair. We\u2019ve gotta keep it moving! They need to get their hair done and get their costumes on! With a poison makeup, I\u2019m more concerned about the entire body. The legs, the arms, the back of the neck. I have to make sure it\u2019s one full, complete makeup. You\u2019re not just worrying about her face. Are her nails starting to turn blue or yellow? Should her feet be dirty? I look at it as one makeup. You know what somebody looks like when they\u2019re tired. You know what somebody looks like when they\u2019re hungover. You see it every day \u2014 people with red noses and puffy eyes. It\u2019s not a monster or alien, where your imagination can run wild. This is something you see every day. There\u2019s no room for failure. The audience is smarter than that.\n\nIf you are a makeup or hair artist who has a great story to share, let us know at stories@vulture.com.", "description": "Michelle Radow walked Vulture through the art of poison makeup, or how to create the look of someone who\u2019s being poisoned.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/how-it-works/10-how-to-makeup.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
