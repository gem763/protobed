The overreacting Democrats and their media backers are the real threat to civility, norms and fairness.\n\nImpeachment is not a game. It\u2019s the Constitution\u2019s safety valve and it should only be applied in the gravest of threats to our nation and system of government.\n\nAsking a foreign nation to get involved in an American campaign matter is wrong. It was wrong when Trump did it. It was wrong when Obama did it. It was wrong when Biden did it. It was wrong when Hillary Clinton, through the Steele dossier, did it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ari Fleischer", "Foxnews.Com Opinion Ari-Fleischer-Dem-Drive-To-Impeach-Trump-Over-Ukraine-Call-Is-Hysterical-Hyperbolic-And-Hypocritical"], "top_image": ""}
