The right thing to do could not be more obvious: stop funding climate deniers.\n\n\u2018This is also a rallying cry to mothers all over the world. If you can, go all together with your babies to the politicians and businesses destroying your children\u2019s future and tell them to stop.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t bury your head in the sand or wait for someone else to do it.

It\u2019s about preventing YouTube from being exploited by fossil fuel companies seeking to warp the public debate in their favour.\u2019\n\nA Google spokesperson said: \u2018We sponsor organisations from across the political spectrum that advocate for strong technology policies.\n\nThe Met insists that the protest ban is legal and proportionate (Picture: SWNS)\n\nMothers hold their babies as they call on Google to do more to fight climate change (Picture: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nMore than 1,600 have been arrested as the 10th day of protests rumble on (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nBreastfeeding mothers demanded a secure future for their babies (Picture: Reuters)\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve been extremely clear that Google\u2019s sponsorship doesn\u2019t mean that we endorse that organization\u2019s entire agenda \u2013 we may disagree strongly on some issues.\n\n\u2018Our position on climate change is similarly clear. Since 2007, we have operated as a carbon neutral company and for the second year in a row, we reached 100% renewable energy for our global operations.\u2019\n\nAs demonstrators raged against the tech firms, hundreds of activists in Trafalgar Square today put black tape over their mouths to symbolise the police\u2019s efforts to silence their protest.\n\nBody found in search for missing Welsh rugby player\n\nOfficers have dragged away a number of people sitting on the pavement including journalist and environmental activist George Monbiot and Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley.\n\nThe Met\u2019s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor insists the ban enacted on Monday night is legal and said he is \u2018completely comfortable\u2019 with the action the force has taken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawyers for Extinction Rebellion were at the High Court today to apply for a judicial review amid claims the order is unlawful and breaches the right to protest.\n\nBut Mr Taylor, who is leading the policing of the demonstrations, says the Met\u2019s action is \u2018entirely proportionate in the circumstances\u2019.\n\nLawyers for Extinction Rebellion were at the High Court today to apply for a judicial review against the ban (Picture: SWNS)\n\nGoogle have been accused of aiding climate change deniers with donations to more than a dozen US organisations (Picture: Reuters)\n\nProtesters say the company\u2019s actions contradict their pledges to become more eco-friendly (Picture: Reuters)\n\nThey say it is not too late to salvage the future of their young ones (Picture: Reuters)\n\nThey used a section 14 of the Public Order Act initially to restrict the protest action to Trafalgar Square.\n\nBut following \u2018continued breaches\u2019 of the order officers moved in to clear the area.\n\nAny assembly of more than two people linked to the XR Autumn Uprising action is now illegal in London.\n\nMore than 1,600 protesters have been arrested since the recent wave of protests began on October 7, 133 of whom have been charged.\n\nDrunk burglar caught sleeping on sofa after breaking into cafe\n\nExtinction Rebellion have been open about their tactics to overwhelm the capacity of policy custody, including by refusing bail after being arrested.\n\nWhen asked if they would be able to arrest everyone, Mr Taylor said the force will \u2018take a balanced and proportionate response\u2019.\n\nHe called Extinction Rebellion\u2019s plans to target the London Underground network tomorrow \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and said it would cause \u2018huge disruption\u2019 for commuters.\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said: \u2018Extinction Rebellion has placed a big toll on us. We\u2019ve had thousands of officers engaged on that protest.\n\nGeorge Monbiot arrived to speak at Trafalgar Square and expected to be arrested (Picture: REX)\n\nMothers wore white sachets to stress that their children\u2019s adult lives are at stake (Picture: Reuters)\n\nPolice swoop in on protesters who are defying a London-wide ban on XR protests (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018The protesters have done everything they can to slow us down, make it more difficult for us to clear the streets by locking on, sometimes in such a manner that it takes four or five hours just to remove two people.\u2019\n\nShe said other officers have been brought in from other police services have been brought in to assist.\n\nMs Dick said policing the protests has taken officers away from their \u2018daily core job\u2019, which for many is dealing with knife crime.\n\nThe Extinction Rebellion\u2019s Julian Thompson said the Government\u2019s silence on the issue has been \u2018deafening\u2019 and questioned why no plan to deal with climate change was mentioned in the Queen\u2019s Speech.\n\nHe added: \u2018At a time when it\u2019s more important than ever to peacefully assemble and protest on these emergencies, we are now at risk of being silenced by the authorities.\n\n\u2018This is a dangerous precedent. We need more democracy, not less.\u2019\n\nA Government spokesman said: \u2018The UK is already taking world-leading action to combat climate change as the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming entirely by 2050.\n\n\u2018While we share people\u2019s concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people\u2019s day-to-day lives.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
