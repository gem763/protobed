After the show, he went home and told his mother, \"This is what I want to do.\"\n\nWanda Sinclair said she encouraged her son to try learning some tricks.\n\n\"He was juggling forks and knives in the kitchen and basically anything he could get his hands on,\" Sinclair said. \"So then we bought him juggling balls.\"\n\nOwen juggles bowling pins, sharp knives and rubber chickens as part of his act. He pays for all his props with the money he earns performing. (B\u00e1rbara d'Oro/CBC)\n\nAfter a year of practising, Owen went back to Buskerfest, where he performed on the street \u2014 just for fun \u2014 and gained the attention of some busking veterans.\n\n\"They gave him pointers, which was amazing,\" his mother said. \"That encouraged him even more and he learned more skills as he went.\"\n\nSoon, Owen was planning his own show, and decided to go for the ByWard Market permit.\n\nMatthew and Tina Warren stopped to watch Owen's show with their daughter, Jojo. They were impressed. (B\u00e1rbara d'Oro)\n\nOwen performs mostly on weekends and during the summer when school's out. He takes care of every detail in the show, from the tricks to the jokes to the playlist.\n\n\"Every year it takes me like one day or so to write the whole show,\" Sinclair said. \"I just go outside in my front yard, put out my box and just perform the show to no one. I make changes and I try to end up with a really good show.\"\n\nChelsea's Owen Sinclair has been juggling in the ByWard Market since he was eight 5:27\n\nFor audience member Matthew Warren, the young performer's spontaneity is captivating.\n\n\"I wasn't sure how he was going to pull off all the tricks. He was really amazing,\" Warren said. \"The way he was speaking, like, he was acting like a full-grown entertainer.\"\n\nTina Warren was also impressed.\n\n\"We were just coming back from getting ice cream and we see this kid making jokes. [He's a] great addition to the vibe and very child-friendly. He's so cute!\"\n\nOwen with his parents and three siblings. His sisters sometimes help him during the show by playing music and making sure he has the props he needs. (B\u00e1rbara d'Oro/CBC)\n\nStill, there are some tricks his mother won't let him learn.\n\n\"There's other ideas he's come up with, like fires. It's another thing he wants to do, but we're not going there yet,\" Wanda Sinclair said.\n\nThat's OK, Owen said: there's plenty of time.\n\n\"I think I am going to keep doing this for a while.\"", "description": "Busker Owen Sinclair earned a permit to perform in Ottawa's ByWard Market at the age of eight, but there's still one trick his mom won't let him do.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294369.1569266680!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/barbara-busker-owen-sinclair-crowd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
