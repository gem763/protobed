He warned that the cordial relationship between dictator Kim Jong Un and President Trump wouldn't be enough to prevent nuclear diplomacy from failing, threatening that \"there could be the exchange of fire at any moment.\"\n\nNorth Korea set a year-end deadline to find common ground and mutual terms for the possible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Chol said Sunday the U.S. would be \"seriously mistaken\" to ignore the deadline.\n\nTRUMP SAYS THIRD SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG UN 'COULD HAPPEN SOON' AMID STALLED NUCLEAR TALKS\n\nOn Thursday, North Korea urged Trump and the White House to act \"wisely\" through the end of the year.\n\n\u201cContrary to the political judgment and intention of President Trump, Washington political circles and DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] policymakers of the U.S. administration are hostile to the DPRK for no reason, preoccupied with the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice,\u201d Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement. \"We want to see how wisely the U.S. will pass the end of the year.\"\n\nNORTH KOREA WILLING TO HOLD DENUCLEARIZATION TALKS WITH US IN COMING WEEKS, STATE MEDIA SAYS\n\nDenuclearization talks have been at a standstill for months, with little diplomatic progress being made. North Korea has demanded that the U.S. lift crippling economic sanctions in order to move forward and possibly dismantle its nuclear program, although analysts have said a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is unlikely.\n\nIn signs of growing impatience, North Korea again embarked on so-called missile diplomacy over the summer -- conducting several weapons tests since July, including one in early October.\n\nWhile Pyongyang has said the country is open to talks with the U.S., the two nations have not had a formal sit-down since the failed Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February -- the second between the two leaders. Their first historic summit took place in Singapore in June 2018.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump has touted a warm relationship with Kim Jong Un. In August he said he received a \"beautiful letter\" from the dictator. In June, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to step foot in the Hermit Kingdom. He met briefly with Kim at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that divides North and South Korea.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that a motive force to overcome all the obstacles between the DPRK and the U.S. and to advance the bilateral relations in the better direction will be provided on the basis of the close relationship,\u201d Gwan also said Thursday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "North Korea is running out of patience\u00a0over stalled nuclear talks and what it says are hostile policies and unilateral disarmament demands from the U.S.,\u00a0a senior Hermit Kingdom official said Sunday local time.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon", "Melissa Leon Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
