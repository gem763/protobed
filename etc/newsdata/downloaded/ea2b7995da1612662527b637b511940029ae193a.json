At some stage that equation is going to stop\n\nCircular economy: crash course\n\nWhen we talk about the circular economy, it is way more than about simply recycling and is very different from the way we produce, consume and live today.\n\nIn today\u2019s linear economy, we dig, make, use and dispose.\n\nWe waste 90 percent of raw materials used to make say, a washing machine, before it even leaves the factory.\n\nBig companies resell half that waste, but SMEs don\u2019t.\n\nThe rest ends up in a landfill, along with 80 percent of all the goods we make within the first six months of their life.\n\nMoving to a circular economy means changing the way we design, produce and use that washing machine.\n\nImagine products designed to keep remanufacturing, refurbishing and recycling in mind.\n\nThat means wasting nothing, where every man-made material, metal or biodegradable part is upcycled.\n\nBy using only renewable energy, we wouldn\u2019t have to hurt the environment for hard to find, finite and expensive resources.\n\nA move to a circular economy would save Europe\u2019s businesses \u20ac600 billion, reducing our greenhouse gases too.\n\nBreaking the cycle of waste\n\nEurope\u2019s Circular Economy package is regarded as packing a punch, money wise.\n\nBetween Horizon 2020, structural funds, the cohesion fund, they are pumping billions into resource efficiency, research and innovation, low carbon and SMEs.\n\nAction wise, they are trying to change waste laws across Europe, set targets for recycling and landfills, and get producers to start reusing their materials.\n\nNow companies in the circular economy can save massive amounts in their material budget, cut their energy costs by millions and reduce their carbon emissions by a bucket load.\n\nThe European Commission is working on a plan to promote circular economy principles such as:\n\n- eco conception\n\n- extended warranty\n\n- and fighting against planned obsolescence, in the private sector\n\nThe waste-free car factory\n\nSome companies have already gotten on board with the circular economy principles.\n\nThe Renault Choisy factory, in France, has been producing car engines and auto parts since 1949 \u2013 but with a special touch.\n\n\u201cWhen they get here, auto parts are sorted between the ones that are in too bad a state, which will be re-smelted, and the other ones which will be repaired,\u201d explained euronews\u2019 Guillaume Desjardins.\n\n\u201cIn the end, once they leave the factory, they\u2019re as good as new.\u201d\n\nThis has allowed the factory to become 100 percent waste free, which has not been easy to achieve.\n\nIt has been thought of and planned since the early design stages of production and carried on throughout the car\u2019s entire life.\n\n\u201cThe circular economy starts from conception,\u201d said Philippe Loisel, Director of the Renault Choisy plant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been rethinking the conception of our mechanical parts to facilitate disassembling and recycling them \u2013 in order to maximise the salvaging process.\u201d\n\nAll of this obviously has a cost, but if big groups have entered the battle, it must mean the project is profitable.\n\nIndeed, consumers are demanding eco-friendly products- More than 80 percent say it is a criteria when deciding on a purchase.\n\nBut that is not all. Last year, this saved the car company 80 percent on energy and 88 percent on water \u2013 as well as four thousand tons of metal.\n\n\u201cWhen a company gets involved in the circular economy, it will increase its profitability,\u201d explained Matthieu Orphelin, from the Circular Economy and Waste Department, ADEME.\n\n\u201cFor at least two reasons: first, it will save on raw material costs, as well as waste management costs at the end of the production.\n\n\u201cBut also because eco-conceived products sell better, it becomes a marketing argument for the company to sell.\u201d\n\nBeyond this, in order to be profitable in the long term for companies, an organised market for waste and upcycle material will have to be created.\n\nInterview with David Palmer-Jones\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones is the President of the European Federation of Waste Management and Environmental Services (FEAD) and CEO of Suez UK.\n\nMaithreyi Seetharaman: \u201cHow do you get industry on board with the circular economy \u2013 especially SMEs?\u201d\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones: \u201cThere are two types of industry really. There are ones who get it, Already those large industries are making those changes, planning for the future. But there is another group that aren\u2019t doing that, they live in the past.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a catalyst. Somebody has got to start and that is why policy is so really important in my opinion. If you can\u2019t quite see that economic just today, because look at commodity prices, they still quite low on occasion, but we know inevitably we can\u2019t continue because we have a finite resource in this world and we can\u2019t continue using three worlds worth of materials, at some stage that equation is going to stop.\u201d\n\nMaithreyi Seetharaman: \u201cHow do you move it beyond recycling? How do you make this a phenomenon that we just feel natural about?\u201d\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones: \u201cToday there\u2019s 800 million tonnes going to landfills which we waste. We bury material and energy in the ground.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do first is get the facilities, the infrastructure on the ground, locally, serving the populations, serving industry to extract that material.\n\n\u201cEco-design, the way we design things has a massive impact on the sustainability of products going forward. Eighty percent of the DNA or the footprint, the environmental footprint is there, polluter pays \u2013 extended producer responsibility they would call it \u2013 but it\u2019s all about paying for the damage environmentally that you do.\n\n\u201cWe see lots of new policy coming from Europe now which really tries to push that back to those industries \u2013 and they\u2019ll have a wake up call won\u2019t they \u2013 because if it costs them money, goodness me, they\u2019ll be designing away, future costs in their processes.\u201d\n\nMaithreyi Seetharaman: \u201cDo you think we go far enough with this European Circular Economy package?\u201d\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones: \u201cIt\u2019s a good start. They are really trying to push that material \u2013 that 800 million tonnes going to landfill, out toward recycling, toward energy and future circularity.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to do is when you push out those materials \u2013 those really valuable materials \u2013 let\u2019s find a market for them. We need to make sure there is an active market, a viable market.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, commodity prices are moving \u2013 they fluctuate a lot, oil prices are down and so sometimes the economics don\u2019t stack up short term. But if we go back to the long term vision, which is developing those demand side measures so we really are attracting those materials into the market place to make that circular loop start to happen.\u201d\n\nAmsterdam embraces circular economy\n\nWith predictions that 580,000 jobs could be created in Europe, and energy cost savings of up to 500 euros per household per year, it is no wonder that cities like Amsterdam are keen to get a slice of the action.\n\nThe circular economy is central to the sustainability goal of The Netherlands \u2013 potentially generating seven billion euros a year, and creating 54 thousand jobs.\n\nAmsterdam is the country\u2019s shop window for why it works, according to the city\u2019s deputy mayor.\n\n\u201cAs cities are growing, the push that they can organise to stimulate innovation and can stimulate transition from linear to circular can be very high,\u201d said Abdeluheb Choho.\n\n\u201cIf there is no economic impact the change that you are trying to achieve from linear to circular thinking will not happen or will not happen as fast as you want to.\u201d\n\nSo, how is Amsterdam going circular? Euronews\u2019 Monica Pinna took a tour to find out.\n\n\u201cBy making the Amsterdam construction sector circular, the municipality expects to create a value of 85 million euros per year and three percent growth in productivity by 2040,\u201d she reported.\n\nParc 2020 \u2013 billed as a sustainable working environment \u2013 is an example of construction circularity, with growth largely coming from material re-use and efficiency improvements.\n\nNothing can be wasted at the site, since each building is made up of things that can be re-adapted for future use elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is to build in such a matter that you can easily reuse components,\u201d said Guido Braam, a circular economy initiator in The Netherlands.\n\n\u201cThe current linear system is totally sub-optimised by every player in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cAnd with the circular economy you are looking at total optimisation.\u201d\n\nAmsterdam\u2019s waste is now a source of income and energy.\n\nEvery year, each city resident, throws away around 370 kilograms of waste on average.\n\nTwenty-seven percent is separated and goes through the AEB incineration complex.\n\n\u201cWhat we see here is the bottom ash with still a lot of valuable metals and other materials in that. You can filter that out to be reused,\u201d explained Marc de Wit, Director of Strategic Alliances, Circle Economy.\n\nWhat happens next closes the economic circle.\n\n\u201cAnnually we have 300,000 tons of bottom ash leftover from the factory. About 10 percent of that is recycled as metals, the remaining 90 percent is minerals that we use to make tiles that are being used to make streets, pavements etc,\u201d explained Loek van Poppel, Programme Manager, Inashco.\n\nAmsterdam aims to recycle 30 percent of municipal waste by 2016 and 65 percent in 2020. The overall EU target is 65 percent by 2030.\n\nThe EU also now has a target to bring landfill use down to 10 percent of waste by 2030.\n\nBut there has been nothing going into landfill in The Netherlands since 2010, as the country leads the circular economy charge!\n\nWill circular thinking take off?\n\nMaithreyi Seetharaman: \u201cWhen you look at cities like Amsterdam and this talk about jobs creation. How realistic is it?\u201d\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones: \u201cOh, its extremely realistic. You know all that material we\u2019ve got to play with, it tends to \u2013 because we do more and more urban living don\u2019t we, so it tends to come towards the population bases.\n\n\u201cSo what you need to get real circularity is a bit of scale \u2013 So they\u2019ve got scale in the likes of Amsterdam, that\u2019s a big population.\n\n\u201cSo, they have the ability to demonstrate like a shop window to the world. that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do \u2013 demonstrate the point that this new form of living works \u2013\n\nIndustrial symbiosis is a big word \u2013 it just means somebody\u2019s waste is another man\u2019s raw material.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what they\u2019ve got to start to do. Pairing up the materials that go round a city and pushing them back into the industries, to start closing that loop and create the sort of jobs that you talk about.\u201d\n\nMaithreyi Seetharaman: \u201cLooking at it from a business perspective, in terms of measures and implementation, what would your recommendations be?\u201d\n\nDavid Palmer-Jones: \u201cHere and now, help us through this first period, create those conditions for the market to allow us to play and then for me it\u2019s all about designing away waste.\n\n\u201cThe world continues to grow in population, we need to find the answers. That will come in my opinion through innovation and technology.\u201d", "description": "In this edition of Real Economy, we take you on a journey to discover how our waste can become sustainable gold \u2013 powering the circular economy of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/322047/1000x563_322047.jpg", "published_at": "2016-01-25"}
