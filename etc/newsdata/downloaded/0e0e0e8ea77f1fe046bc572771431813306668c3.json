But last week, as one reporter put it: \u2018Health chiefs have revealed bacon is safe to eat after all!\u2019\n\nWe had previously been told that more than a few rashers of bacon a week could increase our risk of bowel cancer by as much as 20 per cent. The safe daily limit for red meat was 70g \u2013 equivalent to half a beefburger, one-and-a-half sausages, or just a third of an 8oz steak.\n\nLike most people, I was confused as to how seriously to take these claims, but cut back anyway.\n\nOne in 14 men and one in 19 women will be diagnosed with bowel cancer during their lifetime. And no one wants any additional risk. But then, last week, came what appeared to be a major scientific flip-flop.\n\nFor more than a decade, Government agencies have warned us to cut down on the red and processed meat we eat. But last week, as one reporter put it: 'Health chiefs have revealed bacon is safe to eat after all!'\n\nA new review of the best available evidence \u2013 the very same evidence that underpinned worldwide guidance on meat consumption \u2013 suggested there was hardly any risk at all.\n\nOne of the contributors to the report, Dr Bradley Johnston, from Dalhousie University in Canada, said: \u2018Any health benefits from staying away from meat are uncertain and, if they exist at all, are very small.\n\n\u2018We suggest individuals continue their current consumption of red meat and processed meat.\u2019\n\nAnyone reading this would be forgiven for thinking: \u2018They say one thing, then the opposite. I\u2019m just going to ignore it all from now on.\u2019\n\nExperts, too, recognise that if there is too much conflicting advice the public will just switch off, which is not in anyone\u2019s interests.\n\nSo how can you separate the myths from the genuine messages we should all be taking seriously to maximise the health benefits from our diet?\n\nIn an effort to clarify the issues, The Mail on Sunday has spoken to scientists who have devoted their careers to studying food and cancer.\n\nHere, we\u2019ll examine the most prevalent diet trends said to be linked to \u2013 or claim to protect against \u2013 cancer.\n\nIs bacon safe or not? There have been health scares about roast potatoes and even toast \u2013 are they really true? How many portions of fruit and veg a day is enough to make a real difference to your risk of cancer? And should we cut out sugar?\n\nWhat follows are hopefully reliable answers based on the best scientific evidence. But, of course, it is important to point out that interpreting any claims about the effect of diet is fraught with difficulties.\n\nIn other areas of medicine, for example testing a new drug, there are clear-cut ways of measuring a specific effect. You take a group of patients, randomly divide them in two and give both groups pills, but only one group gets the active drug. The other is given a placebo. Then you look for differences.\n\nBut this is impossible to do when it comes to establishing whether, say, people who eat broccoli get cancer less often. For a start, the potential effects of broccoli may not be seen for decades.\n\nObviously, you cannot be certain that the groups allocated to eating broccoli will stick to it, or accurately report what they have eaten.\n\nThat\u2019s why most nutritional claims are based on what are known as observational studies, which rely on people reporting what they eat and allowing researchers to get updates on their health as they age.\n\nThe trouble is, broccoli-eaters often have other healthy habits so you can\u2019t be sure whether it was the broccoli-eating that caused a particular effect. You also cannot tightly control their diets, so it becomes extremely difficult to work out whether broccoli caused an effect.\n\nSo despite huge advances in statistical analysis, many dietary claims \u2013 while made with the best of intentions to improve public health \u2013 are open to criticism and debate.\n\nMuch of it comes down to interpretation and how the findings are presented. Still, it is possible to cut through the hype and make an informed judgment, which is what we have tried to do here.\n\nAnd what you do after that, ultimately, is up to you.\n\nIs your Sunday roast beef really as bad as smoking? Don't be ridiculous!\n\nBy JO MACFARLANE for the Mail On Sunday\n\nThe first bite of a bacon butty in the morning. A lunch of perfectly moist roast beef, paired with towering piles of crispy roast potatoes and doused in home-made gravy. For many, these are key ingredients to a perfect Sunday.\n\nBut in recent years, mounting evidence has suggested these simple pleasures, enjoyed too often, could wreak havoc on our health.\n\nA series of studies have raised the alarm over red meat, particularly processed meat, linking it to bowel and colon cancers\n\nA series of studies have raised the alarm over red meat, particularly processed meat, linking it to bowel and colon cancers.\n\nIn 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified processed red meat \u2013 including sausages, bacon, ham and p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u2013 as a \u2018definite\u2019 cause of cancer, alongside cigarettes.\n\nThe World Cancer Research Fund advises eating \u2018little, if any\u2019 processed meat such as bacon and sausages, and only \u2018moderate\u2019 amounts of beef, pork and lamb.\n\nThe NHS, too, recommends no more than 70g of cooked or processed meat every day \u2013 equivalent to one-and-a-half pork sausages, two rashers of bacon or one third of an average-sized sirloin steak. But will busting that limit put us on a fast-track to cancer?\n\nThe answer is probably not.\n\nThe current advice stems from a 2010 report by the Government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.\n\nScientists analysed evidence provided by hundreds of studies that had looked at the relationship between meat and cancer since the 1970s, involving millions of participants around the world.\n\nTheir conclusion, based on the analysed research, was that we should err on the side of caution and stick to 70g daily.\n\nBut many of the research included was flawed, leading even the committee itself to state: \u2018Although a number of plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between red meat and colorectal cancer risk, none is supported by convincing evidence.\u2019\n\nSome studies did not distinguish between the effects of eating red meat \u2013 a steak, mince or a leg of lamb \u2013 and processed meat.\n\nOthers drew on dietary habits from outside of the UK where meat production \u2013 and ingredients in products \u2013 can be vastly different.\n\nWorld Health Organisation data shows the colorectal cancer risk is 1.18 times higher if you eat 50 grams of processed red meat every day \u2013 roughly two slices of bacon. But the risk of any cancer is 40 times higher if you smoke, and 70 times higher for those who smoke and drink. (File photo)\n\nAnd then there is the problem in the way the evidence is gathered.\n\nDiet studies rely on participants remembering and then reporting what they\u2019ve eaten over the course of a month or year \u2013 which is, for obvious reasons, unreliable.\n\nAnd, most diets contain a huge variety of foods. So even after making complicated statistical adjustments, it is difficult to determine how any one thing has an effect.\n\nOther studies have shown that, for instance, men who eat a lot of meat are also less likely to eat vegetables and fruit, and more likely to engage in other, unhealthy behaviours such as smoking and drinking alcohol.\n\nRED MEAT CAN POSE A RISK \u2013 BUT IT'S SMALL\n\nSo are all the concerns simply misguided, nannying rubbish? Well, not entirely. There is some legitimate concern over the link between processed red meat \u2013 bacon, ham and such like \u2013 and the risk of bowel cancer.\n\nThe issue is thought to lie with chemicals called nitrates that are added to meat products in order to lengthen their shelf life. Once inside the stomach, these react with bacteria to form nitrosamines, which are known to be involved in the development of bowel cancers.\n\nA Cancer Research UK study of half a million adults, published in the European Journal Of Epidemiology in April, found that those who ate the most processed meat were 20 per cent more likely to get bowel cancer than those who ate the least.\n\nMediterranean diets high in fresh fish, nuts, fruit, vegetables and olive oil can cut the risk of breast cancer. Coffee contains cancer-causing acrylamide \u2013 but only 1-2 micrograms per cup. Below 208 micrograms daily is safe.\n\nBut it is worth putting this into context. Last year, Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, told us: \u2018Only one in a hundred cases of colorectal cancer is said to be related to processed red meat compared to 64,500 cancers a year caused by smoking.\u2019\n\nWorld Health Organisation data shows the colorectal cancer risk is 1.18 times higher if you eat 50 grams of processed red meat every day \u2013 roughly two slices of bacon. But the risk of any cancer is 40 times higher if you smoke, and 70 times higher for those who smoke and drink.\n\nIt all means that on a population level, if every person eats lots of processed meat, it would result in a significant number of extra cancer cases. But for an individual, the risk is small.\n\nAnd this is precisely the point of the highly controversial study on meat published last week.\n\nAlthough the research, published in Annals Of Internal Medicine, concluded that eating just under two bacon rashers every day for most of your life is likely to increase the risk of colorectal cancer, the evidence isn\u2019t strong enough to warrant cutting back significantly. The benefits of cutting back \u2013 the scientists suggest \u2013 are \u2018trivial\u2019.\n\nDiet studies rely on participants remembering and then reporting what they've eaten over the course of a month or year \u2013 which is, for obvious reasons, unreliable. And, most diets contain a huge variety of foods. So even after making complicated statistical adjustments, it is difficult to determine how any one thing has an effect\n\nThe report recommends that eating up to four portions of red or processed meat every week poses no risk \u2013 contrary to almost every other guideline from official health bodies around the world.\n\nPharmacologist David Colquhoun, a professor at University College London, adds: \u2018We have no absolute proof that meat causes cancer.\n\n\u2018To get that, we\u2019d need to lock people away on a closed ward and feed them a high meat diet for their entire lives to see what happened to them.\u2019\n\nProf Colquhoun says the risk posed by red meat specifically has decreased as the evidence has mounted over the years. \u2018The EPIC study in 2013, which followed nearly half a million people over more than 12 years, found red meat posed no detectable risk of death. The increased risk was about two per cent.\u2019\n\nThere are now important questions over whether the evidence from studies \u2013 however weak \u2013 might point to there solely being a risk from processed meat.\n\nWriting in 2017 in the British Medical Bulletin, Dr Ian Johnson, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience, said: \u2018The evidence for an association with colorectal is stronger for processed meat than for red meat, and indeed some still argue that the evidence in relation to red meat remains too weak and inconsistent to justify a conclusion.\u2019\n\nSo, risk-averse types might simply choose to neglect the odd sausage or slice of bacon. But forgoing your Sunday roast or the odd bacon sandwich? That\u2019s just silly.\n\nFruit and veg are good - but you don't need to overdo it Guidelines recommend eating five portions of fruit and veg every day. And most surveys suggest we are actually doing pretty well already, with the average Briton consuming four portions a day. But might that be too little? Recent research suggested we may need to double our efforts to protect against cancer and early death. A major study from experts at Imperial College London suggested that ten portions a day reduced the risk of cancer overall by 13 per cent. If we all did it, millions of lives could be saved, it was claimed. So what is it about munching through vast quantities of veg that has this magical effect? Hilary Powers, emeritus professor of nutritional biochemistry at Sheffield University, says the main message is that 'eating some fruit and veg is better than none' According to the World Cancer Research Fund, fruit and non-starchy vegetables contain compounds such as fibre, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, that have the potential to fight tumours. But it is hard to actually know if this is the reason lower cancer rates are seen in people who eat lots of them. A recent Cambridge study of more than 50,000 British households found that people with more money spent more on \u2018healthier\u2019 foods \u2013 rather than those which are high in calories, fats, refined starches and sugars \u2013 and bought more fruit and vegetables. By contrast, those with less to spend bought less fresh fruit and veg and more high-fat, high-sugar, high-calorie foods. And it\u2019s been shown in many studies that those who are better off are more likely to do other things that are healthy, such as exercise, and not smoke or drink too much. Interestingly, findings from an ongoing European study that is tracking nearly half a million people to investigate the relationships between diet, lifestyle and cancer found that those who followed a pescatarian diet \u2013 eating fish but not meat \u2013 had a lower colorectal cancer risk compared to people who were completely veggie and those who ate meat, but not much fish. In veggies and omnivores, the risk of colorectal cancer did not differ. So it could be fish that\u2019s protective. Hilary Powers, emeritus professor of nutritional biochemistry at Sheffield University, says the main message to take away is that \u2018eating some fruit and veg is better than none\u2019. She adds: \u2018It\u2019s important to understand that eating some fruit and vegetables each day, rather than none at all, can significantly reduce the risk of some cancers.\u2019\n\nDON'T STOP ENJOYING YOUR CRISPY ROASTIES\n\nThe gnarly, crisp ridges of a roast potato are, according to many, the best part of a Sunday roast.\n\nFor many, it\u2019s a case of the browner, the better.\n\nBut a preference for overdone roasties could leave you privy to \u2018toxic cancer agents\u2019, some reports would have you believe. In 2017, following a series of studies, the Food Standards Agency warned of the possible risks involved with over-cooking foods, particularly those high in starch.\n\nThe concerns related, specifically, to roasted potatoes, burnt toast and frozen chips.\n\nThe watchdog encouraged us to \u2018go for golden\u2019 after research found high levels of the chemical acrylamide \u2013 a known carcinogen \u2013 in foods that are burned or over-cooked. The chemical is formed when compounds in these foods \u2013 water, sugar and amino acids \u2013 combine together when heated at high temperatures.\n\nScientists have shown that mice which had been fed large doses of acrylamide develop multiple tumours.\n\nAnd this led to the World Health Organisation labelling acrylamide as a \u2018probable carcinogen\u2019.\n\nThe gnarly, crisp ridges of a roast potato are, according to many, the best part of a Sunday roast. For many, it's a case of the browner, the better. But a preference for overdone roasties could leave you privy to 'toxic cancer agents', some reports would have you believe. File image\n\nBut according to the European Food Safety Authority, its ruling may be over-cautious.\n\nFirst of all, there are many everyday substances that are considered a \u2018probable carcinogen\u2019, including hot drinks. The only confirmed link between acrylamide and tumours is in animals alone.\n\nAnd the amount of acrylamide seen to be harmful was the equivalent of eating at least 40 slices of burned toast per day, for a number of weeks.\n\nToxicology studies have shown that humans and rodents absorb acrylamide at different rates, and process it differently.\n\nOne such study, from 2009, published in the journal Food And Chemical Toxicology, suggested that humans quickly process and excrete any acrylamide we eat, which protects against negative effects.\n\nA 2015 Italian review of research, which examined links between acrylamide and 14 different types of cancer, found \u2018no meaningful association\u2019 with most cancer types, apart from a \u2018modest association\u2019 \u2013 and remember, this doesn\u2019t equate to cause and effect \u2013 with kidney, endometrial and ovarian cancers.\n\n\u2018The evidence linking acrylamide to cancer is weak and inconsistent,\u2019 says Katie Parker, from Cancer Research UK.\n\n\u2018The likelihood of eating so much burnt toast that it significantly impacts on your cancer risk is very, very small.\u2019\n\nDo trendy low-carb diets RAISE the risk of cancer?\n\nFirst came the Atkins, Dukan and South Beach diets. Today, it\u2019s the trendy ketogenic diet, or keto, a low-carb, high-fat plan which even has its own internet hashtag #LCHF.\n\nAdvocates claim that these approaches help people shed weight fast, control blood sugar, beat type 2 diabetes, and even fight off cancer by avoiding eating carbohydrates.\n\nPeople swap pasta for strips of courgette, rice for finely shredded cauliflower, and bread for lettuce leaves.\n\nSome of these diets are more restrictive than others. They range from 130g of carbs a day \u2013 which would mean you could still eat a large baked potato, a portion of rice and still have some left over \u2013 to just 30g, which is the equivalent of just two slices of wholemeal bread.\n\nThat it helps shift weight is in no doubt. Abandoning carbs involves stripping significant calories from your diet.\n\nFirst came the Atkins, Dukan and South Beach diets. Today, it\u2019s the trendy ketogenic diet, or keto, a low-carb, high-fat plan. Advocates claim these approaches help people shed weight fast, control blood sugar, beat type 2 diabetes, and even fight off cancer by avoiding eating carbohydrates, including pasta (file photo)\n\nBut while it is touted as one of the most effective ways to slim, there may well be a huge downside to following the lowest-carb plans in the longer term.\n\nA review of the data, published in the European Heart Journal in April, found a \u2018significant and positive\u2019 chance that these diets were associated with an increased risk of dying from \u2018any form\u2019 of cancer.\n\nThe study, carried out by experts from an international panel, involved looking at half a million participants over a period stretching up to 16 years.\n\nInitially, they examined 24,825 people who had taken part in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1999 to 2010. They found those eating the least carbs were, overall, 32 per cent more likely to die of any cause, and 35 per cent more likely to die of cancer than those eating the most carbs.\n\nThese findings were then confirmed by combining the results of a further seven studies involving nearly 450,000 people, which revealed very low-carb dieters were eight per cent more likely to die of cancer. Of course, these studies were based on surveys, so it\u2019s hard to be sure if factors other than carb intake were also at play.\n\nWhile it is touted as one of the most effective ways to slim, there may well be a huge downside to following the lowest-carb plans in the longer term. A review of the data, published in the European Heart Journal in April, found a \u2018significant and positive\u2019 chance that these diets were associated with an increased risk of dying from \u2018any form\u2019 of cancer. (Above, courgette strips, which followers of the diet eat instead of pasta)\n\nBut lead author Professor Maciej Banach, from the Medical University of Lodz in Poland, said: \u2018These diets should be avoided.\n\n\u2018They might be useful in the short term to lose weight, lower blood pressure and improve blood glucose control, but our study suggests that in the long term they are linked with an increased risk of death from any cause.\u2019\n\nA crucial problem is that very low-carb diets often lack fibre \u2013 plant matter which comes from bread, oats, grains and many fruits and veg.\n\nFibre has long been proven to have a protective effect against bowel cancer specifically, a condition which affects one in 15 men, and one in 18 women in the UK. More than 50 per cent of cases are preventable, and 28 per cent are linked to consuming too little fibre.\n\nServe meat with a yogurt dip \u2013 \u2018good\u2019 bacteria neutralises any carcinogenic chemicals formed when grilling. Some say an alkaline diet \u2013 free of acidic foods like citrus fruits \u2013 protects against cancer. But no study has ever proved the claim.\n\nThe official advice is that, by eating three portions of fibre-rich foods a day \u2013 from porridge, fruit and veg to a slice of bread or a handful of nuts \u2013 our risk could reduce by 20 per cent.\n\nIt we all did this, it could save thousands of lives.\n\nFibre is protective in two ways. First of all, it increases the bulkiness of our waste and reduces the amount of time it takes to move through our digestive system, which means toxins spend less time in the bowel.\n\nIt also provides fuel for the \u2018good\u2019 bacteria in our systems, which in turn produces a fatty acid called butyrate. This protects the cells in the bowel and makes tumours less likely to develop.\n\nAs it stands, nine in ten adults fail to consume the recommended 30g of fibre a day as it is. So cutting out food groups that contain fibre may mean straying even further from the target.\n\nA crucial problem is that very low-carb diets often lack fibre \u2013 plant matter which comes from bread, oats, grains and many fruits and veg\n\nDr Ian Johnson, emeritus fellow at the Quadram Institute Bioscience, says: \u2018Based on the evidence, eating a diet low in fibre over a long period of time could lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.\n\n\u2018A ketogenic diet over just a couple of years might not have an effect \u2013 but the truth is, we just don\u2019t know.\n\n\u2018The protective effect of fibre might be about two-fold if you compare those who eat least with those who eat the most.\u2019\n\nCUTTING OUT SUGAR WON\u2019T CURE CANCER\n\nThe email spread like wildfire. It looked like a paper from the respected US research institution, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and contained the claim: \u2018Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar, it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells.\u2019\n\nThere was only one problem \u2013 it was a hoax.\n\nBut it became so widespread when it was circulated in 2007 that staff at Johns Hopkins were forced to issue a public statement to deny any involvement.\n\nThe theory persists, however, and is regularly trumpeted on social media by health gurus to justify cutting all sugar \u2013 but particularly refined white sugar \u2013 out of the diet completely.\n\nSugar is often described by its opponents as \u2018cancer\u2019s favourite food\u2019 and the \u2018white death\u2019.\n\nOne well-worn health myth is that the man-made sweetener aspartame \u2013 used in everything from fizzy drinks, including Diet Coke and Coke Zero, to chewing gum \u2013 causes cancer (as well as multiple sclerosis, blindness, depression, memory loss and birth defects). The theory has been thoroughly debunked\n\nThe myth suggests that cancer cells need lots of glucose \u2013 the fuel which powers all of the body\u2019s cells \u2013 to develop, so cutting it out will literally starve the cancer and stop it from growing.\n\nWhile it sounds convincing, it is simply not true.\n\nKatie Patrick, a nutrition expert from Cancer Research UK, warns: \u2018All our healthy cells need glucose too, and there\u2019s no way of telling our bodies to let healthy cells have the glucose they need, but not give it to cancer cells.\u2019\n\nFollowing severely restricted diets with very low amounts of carbohydrate could damage health in the long term by eliminating foods that are good sources of fibre and vitamins, they add.\n\nThis is particularly important for cancer patients, because some treatments can result in weight loss and put the body under a lot of stress.\n\nWhile on the subject of sweet things, another well-worn health myth: the man-made sweetener aspartame \u2013 used in everything from fizzy drinks, including Diet Coke and Coke Zero, to chewing gum \u2013 causes cancer (as well as multiple sclerosis, blindness, depression, memory loss and birth defects). The theory has been thoroughly debunked. Yet rumours, often in the form of fake health news posted online, continue to circulate.\n\nSince aspartame was launched in the 1980s, studies have suggested that it could be linked to increased rates of brain tumours and leukaemia in rats, leading to worrying headlines.\n\nBut it was later revealed that some animals were fed the equivalent in sweetener to 20 cans of Diet Coke, every day, for months, until they died. Despite this fact, the whiff of suspicion remains: in 2015, Pepsi dropped aspartame from its US Diet Pepsi drink in response to consumer fears over safety, replacing it with sucralose, another type of sweetener.\n\nYet the overwhelming evidence from robust scientific trials is that aspartame is safe.\n\nNo human studies have found any link to cancer or other problems, and two major reviews \u2013 by the European Food Safety Authority and US National Cancer Institute \u2013 have concluded the sweeteners are safe.\n\nSophia Lowes, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, says: \u2018The link to cancer was between sweeteners and animals but it was never translated into a link in humans.\u2019\n\nThere's no such thing as a cancer-busting superfood Blueberries contain powerful compounds that can protect against cancer. Green juice and celery smoothies can even fight \u2013 and reverse \u2013 the disease. These tales are undeniably appealing because they seem so simple. But the truth is that superfoods for cancer do not exist. At best, their virtues are at least rooted in scientific theory \u2013 but they are exaggerated. Take those blueberries, for example. Scientists in the United States discovered that they contained anthocyanins, a compound thought to have anti-cancer properties which helps clear out toxins, fights damaging compounds in the body and reduces inflammation. Blueberries contain powerful compounds that can protect against cancer. Green juice and celery smoothies can even fight \u2013 and reverse \u2013 the disease. These tales are undeniably appealing because they seem so simple. But the truth is that superfoods for cancer do not exist A Californian study in 2013 found that feeding mice with a diet which was five per cent powdered blueberry reduced the size of their cancer tumours. And last year, another US team reported that human cancer cells reduced by 25 per cent in the laboratory when exposed to blueberry extract. Chemical compounds extracted from, or similar to, those found in blueberries and various other vegetables are being made into cancer drugs, and studied. It all certainly sounds impressive. But none of this proves that consuming even large amounts of blueberries every single day of your life will prevent cancer. Indeed, animal studies often use implausibly high amounts of a compound, which can\u2019t be replicated through diet and may even be harmful. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of food and nutritional sciences at Reading University, says: \u2018If you put anything on cancer cells they tend to die. I\u2019ve been to a conference where someone poured a can of coke on to cancer cells and, surprise surprise, they died.\u2019 There have been studies that reported that people who included a lot of berries in their diet had marginally lower cancer rates. However, Prof Kuhnle is highly sceptical, saying: \u2018In many populations where they\u2019re studied, berries are expensive. So you\u2019re looking at people who can afford them. \u2018These people are wealthier and healthier in general \u2013 and we know that has a big influence on cancer.\u2019 According to Prof Louis Levy, of Public Health England: \u2018If you take in a lot of these so-called superfoods, all you\u2019re doing is enriching the drainage system of the UK with antioxidants, because your system will just flush them out.\u2019\n\nIt's too much of everything that really causes cancer\n\nConsuming too many calories \u2013 whether they come from sugar, bacon, potatoes, toast or blueberries \u2013 will eventually lead to you gaining weight. And being overweight or obese increases your risk of 13 different types of cancer, including bowel, stomach, pancreatic, liver and post-menopausal breast cancer.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s the single biggest trigger for the disease in the UK after smoking.\n\nNaveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at Glasgow University, says: \u2018Sugar doesn\u2019t cause obesity or cancer. But consuming excess calories will make you put on weight, and the extra weight will increase your risk of cancer.\u2019\n\nMangesh Thorat, of the Centre for Cancer Prevention at Queen Mary University of London, adds: \u2018We know the most important thing for most cancers is keeping your weight down. Other than that, relating to diet, there\u2019s nothing specific or evidence-based as an intervention.\u2019\n\nConsuming too many calories \u2013 whether they come from sugar, bacon, potatoes, toast or blueberries \u2013 will eventually lead to you gaining weight. And being overweight or obese increases your risk of 13 different types of cancer\n\nYour risk increases the longer you remain overweight \u2013 but small changes, maintained over time, can make a huge difference.\n\nAn early sign that weight loss may have a protective effect comes from the work of Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University. He pioneered a very low-calorie diet that can, in some patients, reverse type 2 diabetes.\n\nParticipants consumed 800 calories a day for 12 to 20 weeks by drinking low-cal shakes.\n\nThey then reverted to the Government\u2019s EatWell plate, which allows a third of the diet to be carbs \u2013 and consumed plenty of wholegrains, fruit and vegetables, lean meats and pulses.\n\nTheir progress was monitored and compared with a group who didn\u2019t follow the programme or any other weight-loss plan.\n\nAfter a few months, the majority of those on the diet had normal blood sugar levels, and no longer needed medication for diabetes.\n\nTwo years later, many had maintained their health.\n\nBut there was a surprising additional finding. In the group who didn\u2019t follow the plan, there were five weight-related cancer cases \u2013 and none among those who did diet.\n\nProf Taylor said losing weight may affect the speed at which cancer grows.\n\nProf Sattar adds: \u2018Why weight loss may protect against cancer is unknown, but in women, obesity can affect the sex hormones which can then accelerate the growth of certain types of cancer, particularly endometrial \u2013 cancers of the womb lining. Those who put on weight will accumulate fat in the liver, which drives inflammation, leads to scarring and, eventually, to liver cancer.\n\n\u2018There are other drivers, but we just don\u2019t know yet what they are. The only certainty is that there is a link with obesity.\u2019\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget to consider alcohol as part of the weight-loss equation. An evening glass of wine or a pint of beer contributes to your daily calorie total \u2013 and alcohol itself is a risk factor for cancer, even independent of weight.\n\nThe World Cancer Research Fund reports that breast, bowel, liver, stomach, mouth and oesophageal cancers are all strongly related to alcohol.\n\nIn most cases, the risk begins to rise if you\u2019re consuming two to three units every day \u2013 that\u2019s just one medium glass of wine.\n\nDR MICHAEL MOSLEY: Could fasting 16 hours a day REALLY help you keep cancer at bay?\n\nBy DR MICHAEL MOSLEY for the Mail On Sunday\n\nIn the articles above, we\u2019ve revealed the truth about food and cancer. Contrary to popular belief, there is no one thing \u2013 whether that\u2019s red meat, bacon, toast, roast potatoes or anything else we eat \u2013 that raises the risk significantly.\n\nIt\u2019s overall diet that really matters. If we eat too much, we end up becoming overweight. But the fact that carrying too much fat, particularly around the middle, is linked to cancer is something that still surprises a lot of people.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got fat around your tummy, you probably also have quite a lot of visceral fat \u2013 that\u2019s the name for fat that builds up inside the abdomen and around the organs.\n\nThe cancers which are particularly strongly linked to excess fat are breast and bowel, two of our most common forms of the disease. So keeping to a healthy weight and keeping your tummy trim \u2013 ideally your waist should be less than half your height \u2013 are great ways to reduce your cancer risk. And I believe one of the best ways to do this is through intermittent fasting\n\nAnd it is a problem, because it doesn\u2019t just sit there, wobbling. Visceral fat is active, sending out signals to the rest of your body.\n\nSome of these signals make your cells divide more rapidly, which increases your risk of cancer, while others cause inflammation, another big driver of cancer.\n\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, being overweight or obese leads to about 22,800 new cases of cancer each year.\n\nThe cancers which are particularly strongly linked to excess fat are breast and bowel, two of our most common forms of the disease.\n\nCancers of the pancreas, oesophagus and gallbladder, all of which are extremely hard to treat, are also linked to obesity.\n\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, being overweight or obese leads to about 22,800 new cases of cancer each year.

This is one where you reduce your calories to about 600 twice a week.\n\nI suggested it would not only help you lose weight, but, according to studies carried out on animals, might also help cut your risk of developing cancer.\n\nSince then, studies in humans have indicated the same.\n\nSeven years ago I wrote a book, The Fast Diet, with journalist Mimi Spencer, in which we outlined the potential benefits of going on a 5:2 intermittent fasting diet. This is one where you reduce your calories to about 600 twice a week\n\nBritish scientists Dr Michelle Harvie and Professor Tony Howell have carried out studies that showed intermittent fasting helped improve insulin resistance in one group of women.\n\nInsulin resistance is a measure of how much of the hormone your body has to produce to bring your blood sugars down after a meal.\n\nAnother group of women who dieted every day also lost weight, but didn\u2019t see the same insulin improvement. This is important because having high levels of insulin increases your cancer risk.\n\nSo a combination of weight loss and improvement in insulin sensitivity could be highly beneficial.\n\nIn another more recent study, Dr Harvie asked 23 overweight, pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer to cut back their calories, two days a week, for one menstrual cycle.\n\nThis time, as well as standard tests, they agreed to have breast biopsies. Over the course of a month, the women lost an average of three kilos (more than 6 lb), most of it body fat.\n\nIn most of the women there were significant changes in the activity of genes associated with breast cancer.\n\nBigger studies would be needed to really prove intermittent fasting, rather than weight loss generally, was responsible. But the results are interesting.\n\nSKIPPING BREAKFAST COULD BE A GOOD IDEA\n\nIn The Fast Diet, I also wrote about a different form of intermittent fasting, one called time restricted eating. It\u2019s also known as 16:8, and you don\u2019t worry about calories when doing this plan. Instead, you limit the hours within which you eat your meals.\n\nMany of us don\u2019t finally finish eating and drinking until about 10pm thanks to a late-night snack, and then we start eating again soon after we wake up. That means we go without food for about nine hours.\n\nDO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR DR MOSLEY? Email drmosley@mailonsunday.co.uk or write to him at The Mail on Sunday, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT. Dr Mosley can only answer in a general context and cannot give personal replies.\n\nThe idea behind time restricted eating is to extend the length of your \u2018overnight fast\u2019 to 12, 14 or even 16 hours by finishing eating earlier in the evening and starting again much later \u2013 basically, skipping breakfast the following day.\n\nIt has been shown to help people lose weight. But can it also reduce your cancer risk?\n\nIn a large study, 2,400 American women with breast cancer were randomly allocated to either a low-fat diet or given general health advice.\n\nThey were then followed over the next seven years to see if going on a low-fat diet made any difference to the risk of breast cancer recurring. The answer was a resounding \u2018no\u2019.\n\nDespite reducing their fat intake by 19 per cent, the low-fat dieters were no better off than those in the control group.\n\nBut the great thing about this study, from the point of view of researchers investigating time restricted eating, is that the women were asked to keep detailed records of when they ate.\n\nThe women whose diaries showed that they had fasted for more than 13 hours a night had 36 per cent less chance of a breast cancer recurrence than those who had been fasting for under 13 hours.\n\nThere is a lot more information about intermittent fasting, foods and their impact on cancer in my latest book, the Fast 800.
