It was not immediately clear how much the business would fetch.\n\nTV networks in New Zealand, which has a population of about five million people, have been facing growing pressures from shrinking advertising revenue and competition from popular streaming services like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nMediaworks reported a loss of NZ$5.5 million ($3.50 million) for the year ended December 2018, weighed down by the Three TV business.\n\nLocal media reported that staff at Three TV, which includes journalists and news readers, fear that the network could be closed by Christmas this year in case a buyer is not found quickly.\n\nJournalists and media commentators discussed the announcement on social media and called for efforts from the public to help the popular TV network to find a buyer.\n\nBroadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi told local media that the government would not interfere in the commercial decision of a private company.", "description": "New Zealand's largest independent broadcaster Mediaworks said on Friday it is looking to sell its beleaguered television business and has appointed an adviser to identify potential buyers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
