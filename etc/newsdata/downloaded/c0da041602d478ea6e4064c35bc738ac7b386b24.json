prepares for 'guerrilla warfare' ahead of John Bercow ruling", "language": "en", "text": "Get the biggest politics stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me

Speaker John Bercow.\n\nMr Johnson will later today try and secure the right for a second knife-edge Commons vote on his Brexit deal.\n\nBut after his first attempt was neutered by MPs on Saturday, he now may be denied a second chance by the Speaker.\n\nMr Bercow, who Tory Brexiteers have accused of being pro-Remain, will rule this afternoon on if Mr Johnson can bring his motion for a second time.\n\nLabour's Jon Ashworth has said he does not believe that the government resubmitting its motion is within Parliamentary rules - which say MPs can not debate an issue they've already given a verdict on.\n\n\"That debate on the Queen's Speech has been abandoned, as far as we understand it, and the Government are trying to bring back a vote which was dealt with in the House of Commons on Saturday,\" Mr Ashworth told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\n\"I don't understand how that is in the rules of the House of Commons, given on Saturday we amended that motion and that motion passed the House of Commons.\"\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENT/AFP via Getty Imag)\n\nIf the Speaker blocks the move, focus will switch to the Government bringing its Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) before MPs on Monday, with a vote on its second reading on Tuesday.\n\nBut one senior DUP source told The Daily Telegraph: \u201cIt will be parliamentary guerilla warfare.\u201d\n\nIf Mr Bercow allows the debate to go ahead, the SNP have tabled an amendment which calls on the Mr Johnson to secure a delay until Jan 2020 so that a general election can be held.\n\nIf he refuses the debate then it will be followed by statements from the front benches and howls of outrage from Brexiteers.\n\nMinisters insist they \"have the numbers\" to push the agreement through, but the parliamentary situation appears to be on a tightrope.\n\nBut Labour has made clear it will try to hijack the legislation by putting down amendments for a second Brexit referendum and a customs union with the EU.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer even indicated that he would attempt to enter into negotiations with former Tory allies the DUP.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nShadow solicitor general Nick Thomas-Symonds said that Labour MPs will call for a confirmatory referendum, adding that he thought Parliament may vote in favour of Britain staying in a customs union with the bloc.\n\n\"A customs union is going to be one of the amendments that comes through and that is something that is going to have a very good chance of getting a majority,\" Mr Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour.\n\nBut, in a column for The Daily Telegraph, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said making a customs union part of any pact \"would take us back to square one and render the UK unable to strike our own bilateral trade agreements around the world\".\n\nDespite being forced by Parliament to request a Brexit delay from Brussels after another embarrassing Commons defeat on Saturday, Mr Johnson and Ministers are talking up their chances of rushing Brexit legislation through.\n\nThe move came amid reports that the EU was considering offering the UK a \"flexible extension\" to February, allowing it to leave whenever an agreement is secured.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nThe PM is striking a bullish stance as he faces another rollercoaster week in the Commons, insisting the UK will still quit the EU in 10 days.\n\nHe abandoned plans for a meaningful vote on a Saturday sitting of the Commons after suffering an embarrassing defeat at the hands of former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin.\n\nBut the PM had not suffered a loss but achieved a \"boost to his strategy\", according to former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.\n\n\"For every time he is forced to take a defiant stand against the Remainers in Parliament, it only becomes clearer to the British public just who is fighting desperately and against the odds to deliver their wishes, and who is to blame for the fact that Brexit is not yet over,\" Mr Duncan Smith wrote in The Daily Telegraph.\n\nAfter losing the vote, Mr Johnson had no option but to write to European Council president Donald Tusk, as Parliament demanded, requesting a three-month extension to the end of January.\n\nThe PM did not sign the letter, and sent a second communication insisting that a delay would be \"deeply corrosive\" for the UK and the EU.\n\nLabour accused Mr Johnson of behaving like a \"spoiled brat\".\n\n(Image: PRU/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe DUP was reported to be considering backing Labour's move to force a new customs union with the EU into WAB legislation.\n\nCommons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the Government aimed to hold a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal on Monday.\n\nMr Bercow said he would consider whether to allow the Government's plans, but he could rule that such a vote effectively happened on Saturday and cannot be repeated so soon.\n\nHowever, party chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 5 Live he wanted to engage with the Government to see \"where things stand\".\n\nIf the PM's deal is amended he will have no choice but to accept a long delay to the UK's departure from the bloc.\n\nA Government source said: \"Parliament needs a straight up-and-down vote on the deal... or do they want to frustrate and cancel Brexit altogether?\n\n\"We cannot allow Parliament's letter to lead to Parliament's delay.\"\n\nThe source said the WAB would need more late-night and weekend sittings by MPs.", "description": "Mr Johnson will later today try and secure the right for a second knife-edge
