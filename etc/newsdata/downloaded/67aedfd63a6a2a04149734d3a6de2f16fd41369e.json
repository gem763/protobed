That's where Leona and Harry Helmsley come in. They control the building through a lease that runs to the year 2075, and according to them they plan no changes -- especially now Leona's arch-enemy, Donald owns the building,\" reported a local New York City journalist at the time.\n\nLeona Helmsley became known as a symbol of 1980's greed and earned the nickname \"the Queen of Mean\" after her 1988 indictment and subsequent conviction for tax evasion. One employee had quoted her as saying, \"Only the little people pay taxes.\"\n\nIn the newly resurfaced video in \"American Built: Empire State Building,\" Trump goes after the woman that he saw as standing in the way of his plans.\n\n\"I'm not a huge fan of Leona. I haven't been a huge fan of Leona, never will be a huge fan of Leona. But right now at this moment, they have a lease and we'll see about that lease,\" said Trump in 1994. \"I have a lease on the building and the land and we're all going to make a determination as to what is happening.\"\n\n\"Trump went to court to try to break the existing land-lease, but a judge ruled against him, and he wound up selling his share for $57.5 million,\" Doocy explains.\n\nThe Fox Nation show also reexamines the planning of the Empire State Building in the roaring 1920s and the building of what would become the tallest building in the world at the time in the 1930s, in the midst of the Great Depression.\n\nAfter the September 11 terror attacks, the Empire State Building would briefly become the tallest building in New York City again, and its significance resonated with many at the time.\n\n\"The World Trade Center surpassed it as the tallest building in the world. And when that was gone you know the Empire State Building had lost that partner in the city skyline and in the history of New York City,\" said Kate Lemos McHale of the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission.\n\nTo watch all of \"American Built: Empire State Building\" visit Fox Nation and join today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.
