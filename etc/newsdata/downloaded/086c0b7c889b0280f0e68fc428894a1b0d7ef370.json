Last week, families of the victims who were killed during a Batman movie at a theater in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012 wrote a letter to Warner Bros. demanding that the studio donate profits to gun-victim charities.\n\nWarner Bros. defended the film, explaining in a statement that one of the functions of storytelling is to \u201cprovoke difficult conversations around complex issues.\u201d\n\nIn his interview, Mr. Uslan cited provocative works of 1970s cinema that he described as \u201cJoker\u201d antecedents such as Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cMean Streets\u201d and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d the Asbury Park Press reported.\n\n\u201cIf anything, I believe movies can shake people up and bring issues to attention, whether it\u2019s about guns or the need to treat mental illness or the need for civility and for us to start talking with each other instead of at each other again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t suppress that, you can\u2019t censor that.\u201d\n\nHis comments came one day after The Wrap published an interview with \u201cJoker\u201d director Todd Phillips, who also defended the film as sparking a conversation around uncomfortable issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised. \u2026 Isn\u2019t it good to have these discussions?\u201d Mr. Phillips said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it good to have these discussions about these movies, about violence? Why is that a bad thing if the movie does lead to a discourse about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really been eye-opening for me.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
