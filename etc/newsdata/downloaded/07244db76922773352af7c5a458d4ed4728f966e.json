And Franco\u2019s attorney, early this morning, denied the allegations. \u201cThis is not the first time that these claims have been made and they have already been debunked,\u201d he said in a statement, adding: \u201cJames will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity seeking lawsuit.\u201d\n\nRead: The weaponization of awkwardness\n\nBut it\u2019s worth pausing, while the suit is new, to consider the specifics of the allegations: the denial of industry-standard protections for the actors, the school\u2019s insistence that those actors constantly push beyond their comfort zone. The broad outlines of the story the women are telling are there, again and again, in discussions of sexual harassment and abuse: pressure applied. Comfort zones treated not as guides to appropriate behavior, but as hindrances to it. People\u2019s internal sense of what is acceptable for them, and to them\u2014and what is not\u2014ignored and, sometimes, turned against them.\n\nComfort zone, the term itself, is ecological in origin: It refers to the range of temperatures at which organisms will not need to expend energy on thermoregulation. In social and cultural contexts, though, the term is typically treated as a negative\u2014not a matter of blunt biological necessity so much as a reminder that one\u2019s preferences about the world can double as impediments. In art, in business, in work, in life, in a culture that prizes self-optimization and denigrates comfort accordingly, a comfort zone can become a place that suggests complacency. And comfort itself can function as a paradox: The best comfort is to be found, American culture will often tell you, in making yourself uncomfortable.\n\nIn some ways, certainly, those ideas are apt. Progress, at the level of the individual person and the level of a culture more broadly, often demands, very specifically, discomfort. But the Franco suit suggests the other side of that logic. Nudity reportedly encouraged, though an actor might be uncomfortable being naked on a stage. Sex scenes seeming to play out despite people\u2019s stated discomfort with them. Internal temperatures ignored. It is a theme. Here is part of the exchange recorded by the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez in March 2015\u2014a discussion with Harvey Weinstein, conducted in a hotel hallway, recorded as part of a New York Police Department sting operation:\n\nWeinstein: I won\u2019t do anything and you\u2019ll never see me again after this. Okay? That\u2019s it. If you don\u2019t\u2014if you embarrass me in this hotel where I\u2019m staying\u2014 Gutierrez: I\u2019m not embarrassing you\u2014 Weinstein: Just walk\u2014 Gutierrez: It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t feel comfortable. Weinstein: Honey, don\u2019t have a fight with me in the hallway. Gutierrez: It\u2019s not nothing, it\u2019s\u2014 Weinstein: Please. I\u2019m not gonna do anything. I swear on my children. Please come in. On everything. I\u2019m a famous guy. Gutierrez: I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m feeling very uncomfortable right now. Weinstein: Please come in. And one minute. And if you wanna leave when the guy comes with my jacket, you can go.\n\nThis is typical\u2014not just of the stories told of Weinstein, but also, too often, of sexual scripts. Gutierrez was saying, again and again, that she was uncomfortable; Weinstein was, again and again, ignoring her. The aggressor, impatient, demanding, unwilling to hear protestations of discomfort. \u201cCat Person,\u201d Kristen Roupenian\u2019s short story, went viral in 2017 in part because it was a literary explanation of a phenomenon already familiar to so many people: comfort zones declared and ignored.
