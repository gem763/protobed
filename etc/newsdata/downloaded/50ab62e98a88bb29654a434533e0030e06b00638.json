His condition could not be more serious than it has been for the last three days.\"\n\nMembers of a government-constituted team that is treating Sharif testified before the Lahore and Islamabad courts on Friday to verify the seriousness of his condition.\n\n\"If he doesn't receive immediate treatment, his life is in danger,\" said Saleem Cheema, a member of the team in testimony before the Islamabad court.\n\nAyaz Mahmood, the head of the team, confirmed at the Lahore court hearings that Sharif was suffering from an issue where his blood platelets were being destroyed.\n\nSharif was admitted to hospital earlier this week, after he complained of bleeding from his gums and other ailments. Platelets are blood cells that help the human body to form clots to stop bleeding.\n\nThe three-time former prime minister is serving a seven-year jail sentence after being convicted in a corruption case last year.\n\nHe remains under investigation in the sugar mills corruption case, while a sentence in a third case was suspended in September. He denies all charges.\n\nOn Thursday, after repeated accusations from PML-N leaders of government negligence in treating Sharif, Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered authorities to give the former PM \"the best possible healthcare\".\n\n\"Political differences notwithstanding, my sincere prayers are with Nawaz Sharif for his health,\" said Khan. \"I have directed all concerned to ensure provision of the best possible health care and medical treatment to him.\"\n\nPolitical differences notwithstanding, my sincere prayers are with Nawaz Sharif for his health. I have directed all concerned to ensure provision of the best possible health care and medical treatment to him. \u2014 Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) October 24, 2019\n\n'Fundamental rights denied'\n\nSharif has suffered a number of health issues in recent years. In June 2016, while still prime minister, he travelled to London for open-heart surgery to attend to a perforation in that organ.\n\nSince being jailed in July last year, Sharif has been held at Lahore's Kot Lakhpat jail and by the country's anti-corruption watchdog, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).\n\nNAB continues to investigate a third corruption charge against Sharif related to the family-owned sugar mill.\n\nPML-N leaders say Sharif has been denied his fundamental rights in jail, and that he has been incarcerated in cells for death row prisoners.\n\n\"The struggle began in jail, for his personal doctor to be allowed to attend to him,\" said Chaudhry, the PML-N leader.\n\nSharif's daughter and political heir apparent Maryam Nawaz Sharif - convicted alongside her father last year but released thereafter after her sentence was suspended - was re-arrested in August by NAB as they investigated a separate corruption case.\n\nMaryam Nawaz was also admitted to hospital earlier this week to receive treatment. She was discharged and returned to jail early on Friday.\n\nThe Lahore High Court heard a bail application by Maryam on Friday, deferring proceedings until next week.\n\nAsad Hashim is Al Jazeera's digital correspondent in Pakistan.
