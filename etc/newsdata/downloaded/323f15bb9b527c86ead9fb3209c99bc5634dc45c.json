We, kind of, set up in our culture this pro-con binary,\" she said in an interview.\n\nAhead of turkey dinner, Checkup asked Gaylord how to keep political chatter positive \u2014 and keep everyone at the table until pie is served.\n\nListen, don't argue\n\nAccording to Gaylord, it's best to temper expectations about how much one's opinion can sway that of another.\n\n\"Part of it is just coming to the recognition that you are not going to change their mind, most likely. So just give that up,\" she explained.\n\nWhen it comes to tough conversations, Mary Gaylord encourages families to listen with curiosity. (Submitted by Mary Gaylord)\n\nInstead, she suggests opening up and listening. Often, people make the mistake of challenging another person's viewpoint.\n\nArguing can often lead to more arguing, she says.\n\n\"What you give them is often what you're going to get back,\" she said.\n\nBe curious\n\nAsking questions with the goal of learning is a good next step, Gaylord suggests.\n\n\"If you want to better understand somebody, genuinely show curiosity. Don't ask 'gotcha' questions,\" she said.\n\nThe best way forward, Gaylord adds, is to ask personal questions rather than highlighting news headlines or data points.\n\nConsider this question she asked her politically-opposite father years ago: \"How did your political identity form over the years?\"\n\n\"So really, asking people, 'What's your story?' that can be really fun and interesting,\" she said.\n\nBack off\n\nIf you've tried the above, Gaylord says that every now and then, you just have to cut your losses.\n\n\"Sometimes you've got to just end the conversation if it's just going downhill fast,\" she said. That can be as simple as saying, \"Let's enjoy the dinner.\"\n\nUltimately, Gaylord says that these types of scenarios offer a choice: People can choose to be right, and they can choose to have a relationship.\n\n\"I have decided that with people there are some people I'll choose not to have a relationship with, and that's okay,\" she said.\n\n\"Everybody has their choices to make, but [when] it comes to families for me, I choose relationship over winning or being right.\"\n\nHow do you handle politics at the dinner table?
