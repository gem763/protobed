A date with Michigan State promised a challenge and provided some clarity: Yup, what we saw was real. Ohio State is real good, y\u2019all.\n\nIn the words of selection committee chairmen past, the Buckeyes look complete: powerful offense, dominant defense combining to overwhelm opponents. It\u2019s why they ascend to the top seed in this week's edition of the Football Four.\n\nOhio State quarterback Justin Fields, is tackled by Michigan State defensive lineman Jacub Panasiuk, left, and defensive back Josiah Scott during the second half at Ohio Stadium.

Alabama is similarly difficult to assess \u2013 and no fair just saying \u201cbecause \u2018Bama\u201d \u2013 but if the Tide has not been as complete (that defense has some work to do), it shreds opponents, anyway. It\u2019s the same with Oklahoma. And LSU has gotten plenty of credit for that win at Texas a month ago, but has feasted on pastries since.\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6 in college football\n\nWEEK 6 OBSERVATIONS: College football is crazy, so don't write off Auburn\n\nBottom line: Even with clarity slowly emerging, we\u2019re still at the point where it would be easy to take the top seven or so, rank them in any order and make a good case. As always, remember we pick the bracket as if the season was over today.*\n\nFootball Four *\n\n1. Ohio State \u2013 Through six games, Ohio State is the nation\u2019s most impressive team. Michigan State was the first test? Sure \u2013 and the Buckeyes looked very much like they\u2019ve looked in the first five games.\n\nBIG GAP: Ohio State's defeat of Michigan State exposes talent gap\n\n2. Alabama \u2013 No truth to the rumor that Tua threw six touchdown passes against BYE (though that\u2019s pretty much what he\u2019s been doing, and who the Tide has been playing). Things could get at least a tad more difficult this week at Texas A&M \u2026 but probably not.\n\n3. Oklahoma \u2013 Trailing 7-0 at Kansas, sound the alar\u2014 oh wait, never mind, the Sooners ran off 42 consecutive points after that. It was sloppy, yeah, but convincing. Up next, the annual showdown in the Cotton Bowl with Texas.\n\nSOONERS ROLL: Hurts provides four touchdowns in Kansas win\n\n4. LSU \u2013 The Tigers just keep rolling. Joe Burrow and the newfangled offense has been terrific. Utah State had no shot. But here comes a showdown with Florida. The Gators\u2019 defense figures to be much more challenging than anything LSU has seen so far.\n\nFour More **\n\n5. Clemson \u2013 The Tigers took the weekend off, which was probably good after that scare last week at North Carolina. Now for Florida State, though that\u2019s not exactly the same kind of challenge as it was a few years back.\n\n6. Georgia \u2013 If you\u2019re concerned because it took the Bulldogs a while to pull away from Tennessee, you\u2019re overanalyzing things. Just keep it simple, like Kirby Smart would want: These are very good Dawgs.\n\n7. Florida \u2013 The Swamp was as loud as it has been for many years as the Gators smothered Auburn. Up next, a trip to Baton Rouge, where the Gators will encounter LSU in a stadium that is that loud every Saturday night.\n\nFIRST STEP: Florida's win over Auburn just first step in unforgiving SEC gauntlet\n\n8. Wisconsin \u2013 Jonathan Taylor runs for four touchdowns, catches a touchdown pass, and the Badgers keep rolling. Not that Kent State was going to provide much resistance.\n\nA few more after that ***\n\nAuburn \u2013 That defense is terrific, but the offense ran into a buzz saw at Florida. Freshman quarterback Bo Nix has been good and getting better, but had a significant hiccup.\n\nNotre Dame \u2013 OK, it was Bowling Green. It was still impressive. Ian Book threw five TD passes. The Irish rolled. Yeah, it was Bowling Green.\n\nPenn State \u2013 The Nittany Lions just keep winning, and impressively. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t concede the Big Ten East to Ohio State just yet.\n\nLIONS ROAR: Penn State defense dominant in defeat of Purdue\n\nTexas \u2013 The Longhorns pulled away from West Virginia, Sam Ehlinger flashed the \u201cHook \u2018em\u201d sign at the Mountaineers fans, let\u2019s move on to Dallas.\n\nFutile Four ****\n\nPac-12 \u2013 Yeah, the entire league. Technically, the Pac-12 remains in contention to slip into the Football Four bracket. Realistically, its hopes took a huge hit when Washington lost at Stanford. Oh, and also when Florida beat Auburn, because part of the argument for Oregon would be predicated on the Ducks\u2019 quality loss in the opener. Now it\u2019s all slippin\u2019 away.\n\nUCLA \u2013 Yeah, an individual Pac-12 team. It seems that second-half outburst to beat Washington State was an anomaly, a blip never to be repeated. Getting manhandled by Oregon State is a bad, bad thing. Ugh.\n\nOklahoma State \u2013 Texas Tech blew out to a big lead as Spenser Sanders threw three interceptions and lost two fumbles. Oklahoma State left Austin, Texas, a couple weeks ago feeling positive despite a loss. With Lubbock in the rearview mirror, the Cowboys need to take a long look at themselves.\n\nTulsa \u2013 Ahead 30-9 of SMU after three quarters, the Golden Hurricane \u2026 gave up three fourth-quarter touchdowns \u2026 and lost in triple overtime. Sigh.\n\n* The season is not over today.\n\n** Don\u2019t be worried that your team sits just outside the cut. This is a weekly snapshot. And what do we know, anyway?\n\n*** See the previous note, but it\u2019s OK to be slightly concerned or very angry. But what do we know, anyway?\n\n**** No note necessary.", "description": "This week's College Football Playoff projection has Ohio State as the No. 1 seed followed by Alabama, Oklahoma and LSU in the field.", "authors": ["George Schroeder", "Published A.M.
