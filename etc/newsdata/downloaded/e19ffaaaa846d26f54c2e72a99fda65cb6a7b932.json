Not that I\u2019m in the habit of scrolling through Garnett\u2019s Instagram, but last November he posted something curious: Adam Sandler took a selfie with the former NBA player in the background. What are Adam Sandler and Kevin Garnett doing hanging out together? I wondered. Was it just a set visit or a day of work, or was he ack-ting in this movie about a diamond-district jeweler and a particularly frenetic few days of his life?\n\nIn Gems, Kevin Garnett plays \u2026 Kevin Garnett. It\u2019s not a gag, like Mike Tyson in The Hangover; it\u2019s not like Julia Roberts\u2019s cameo in Ocean\u2019s Twelve, where Julia Roberts-as-Tess is talked into pretending to be the actual Julia Roberts because they sorta look alike. An R&B star (whom I won\u2019t name, because spoilers!) has a cameo in Hustlers that is legitimately breathtaking because it punctuates the whole slick, exclusive world inside a strip club where women can monetize desire \u2014 this isn\u2019t that either. Gems takes place in 2012, during the Eastern Conference semifinals, and the movie establishes early on that basketball is important to the narrative and to the movie\u2019s main character. Garnett isn\u2019t a cameo to set the scene or show clout \u2014 he\u2019s really acting, and he\u2019s really great.\n\nHoward Ratner (Adam Sandler) is the kind of guy who\u2019s always working an angle, always looking to score, always talking himself into one problem just to delay something else. The entire movie is populated with guys he owes money to: various other jewelers, pawn shops, his own family. He\u2019s saddled with debt, and the pressure hangs over him intensely, but there\u2019s a perverse optimism about Howard that you can\u2019t look away from: This could really be the deal for him that goes off like gangbusters, he seems to say in every scene, but if it\u2019s not this deal today then maybe this other one next week. It\u2019s hard not to root for him, even as he runs to the next quagmire, getting money for one thing just to go gamble it on another.\n\nGarnett, then playing for the Celtics, walks into Howard\u2019s store with a small entourage, brought there by Howard\u2019s well-connected middleman, Demany (LaKeith Stanfield). Howard is extroverted and a salesman, not starstruck or a fanboy; basketball lights his brain on fire. He calls him KG, trots out some kitschy goods (importantly: Furby-shaped bling). Only because he\u2019s KG, and because he\u2019s here in his store, Howard brings out something special just to show it off. From some Ethiopian Jews, he explains, he\u2019s found and purchased a purple-blue iridescent rare opal. The Oneohtrix Point Never score pulsates in the background. Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s thee uncut gem!\n\nLike Thanos in Avengers: Endgame or an old-money socialite on the Upper East Side, Garnett is transfixed. He holds the gem and looks at it so intensely it\u2019s like he\u2019s looking through it. In Gems, the rock\u2019s power is basically in the eye of the beholder; Howard looks at it and basically only sees the million dollars he thinks it\u2019s worth, but Garnett sees it as a totem. He asks Howard if he can keep it for the night, just so he can have it for the Celtics\u2019 game against the Philadelphia 76ers. Over the course of the movie, through Garnett\u2019s four scenes (with a little game footage from the real Celtics\u201376ers games that year), he\u2019s obsessed with the gem in a way that makes you obsessed with it. He pops in and out of the movie and every time it seems like a miracle that this massively famous, powerful person keeps coming back to Howard\u2019s shitshow of a store. Every time, he fusses with Howard and is obviously annoyed by him, but the stone keeps him coming back. \u201cWhy are you playing with my emotions,\u201d he says at one point, after Howard declines to sell him the stone and then almost does and goes back and forth again. There\u2019s a hilariously frustrated anguish to the way Kevin Garnett is playing a man obsessed with what, at face value, just seems like a very bougie accessory.\n\nThe Safdies have a knack for tapping nonprofessional actors to live in and around their main characters. It adds to the richness of the world, where you can\u2019t tell who\u2019s acting and who\u2019s just living and breathing and working as they normally would, but with a camera in the room. The brothers prefer \u201cfirst-time actor\u201d instead of \u201cnonactor.\u201d The Weeknd pops up in Uncut Gems for a cameo and a performance of his first hit, \u201cThe Morning,\u201d but Garnett is a real supporting actor here, where the movie plays with his status and fame but also gives him real scenes and the same desperate ambition as everyone else. Kevin Garnett in Uncut Gems is an instant classic.", "description": "I love a good celebrity stunt cameo \u2014 Halsey presenting a Grammy to Ally in A Star Is Born, hello! \u2014 so I was very excited to see how the Safdie brothers, in their new movie Uncut Gems, would use Kevin Garnett.", "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/11-kevin-garnett-uncut-gems-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
