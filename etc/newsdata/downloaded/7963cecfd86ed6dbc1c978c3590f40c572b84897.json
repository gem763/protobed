The Armenian Genocide Resolution (H.Res.296) was adopted by a vote of 405 to 11.\n\nArmenian National Committee of America Executive Director Aram Hamparian stated, \"The ANCA welcomes the U.S. House of Representatives vote overriding the longest-lasting foreign veto in American history \u2013 Ankara's gag-rule against honest American remembrance of the Armenian Genocide. We must now move forcefully toward a truthful, just and comprehensive resolution of Turkey's crime against humanity that killed over 1.5 million innocent Armenians.\"\n\nHamparian continued, \"While much can be said of today's vote - this is crystal clear. First, this vote exposed - in powerful ways - Ankara's attempts to enlist America in its obstruction of justice for the Armenian Genocide. Second, this vote places America on the side of justice, which has, for far too long, been denied to the victims and surviving generations of the Armenian Genocide.\"\n\nThe Armenian Genocide Resolution (H.Res.296) establishes, as a matter of U.S. policy, 1) the rejection of Armenian Genocide denial, 2) ongoing official U.S. government recognition and remembrance of this crime, and 3) support for education about the Armenian Genocide in order to help prevent modern-day atrocities. Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) led the House effort, while Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) are spearheading the Senate measure (S.Res.150).\n\nThe ANCA has consistently pushed back against Turkey's denials, striving to put America on the right side of the Armenian Genocide. Thousands of letters and phone calls have already been sent to Congress by Armenian American advocates through the ANCA online portal \u2013 anca.org/genocide.\n\nFor more information on the Armenian Genocide: www.anca.org/endthegagrule.\n\nCision More\n\nView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/anca-us-house-votes-overwhelmingly-to-lock-in-armenian-genocide-recognition-rejecting-turkeys-denial-of-this-crime-300947655.html", "description": "- Armenian National Committee of America Supported Bipartisan Measure (H.Res.296) Integral to Establishing Principled U.S. Policy on the Armenian Genocide WASHINGTON , Oct. 29, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- In ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/W8nT6izGT3JGBwFlMGfYbg--~B/aD0yMjU7dz00MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://globalfinance.zenfs.com/en_us/Finance/US_AFTP_PRNEWSWIRE_LIVE/ANCA_US_House_Votes_Overwhelmingly-0609dccadbfac2396c151f3f93ac15ad", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
