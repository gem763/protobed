Back in July, Eurostar\u2019s ski train service, which travels from London to the Tarentaise region of the French Alps, is one went on sale all dates of the season. The popular service provides direct access to some of the Alps\u2019 most popular ski resorts, including Tignes, Courchevel and Les Arcs.\n\nOn October 17, tickets for indirect winter rail journeys to the Alps went on sale, too, for travel dates between January and March 2020.\n\nThese indirect journeys provide an alternative to the popular direct Eurostar ski train because skiers and snowboarders can access resorts that are not on the direct route, such as Alpe d\u2019Huez, Avoriaz, Les Gets, Morzine and Montgenevre in France, Sauze d\u2019Oulx in Italy, and the Swiss resorts of Saas Fee and Zermatt - by using a combination of Eurostar to Paris and TGV from Paris to the Alps. Travellers can also travel from Paris by sleeper train to resorts such as Serre Chevalier in France and Claviere in Italy, or take high-speed services via Brussels to Cologne to take sleeper trains to the ski slopes of Austria. The Austrian AlpenExpress also recently announced its 2019/20 timetable to nealy 100 of the country's top resorts.\n\nWherever the final destination travelling by train to the mountains has become an increasingly popular choice for skiers and snowboarders, as both the logistical and environmental benefits of train travel become more appealing to a variety of travellers, including families, groups and the budget savvy. Below we run through the best ski resorts to reach by rail, and how to do it.\n\nAvoriaz, France\n\nThe central hub of the vast 650km Portes du Soleil, Avoriaz is a great base for exploring the ski area's intermediate-friendly terrain.
