Several high-profile lobbying and public relations firms dropped the Saudis as a client. Think tanks, including the Brookings Institution, severed ties with the Saudi government. Businesses pulled out of a major conference in Riyadh shortly after Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nAs the U.S. intelligence community, and the United Nations, were determining that Saudi Arabia was culpable in the killing, members of Congress demanded accountability. Democrats led the charge on a series of bills that would have halted U.S. arms sales to the kingdom and ended U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s disastrous war in Yemen. Republicans were outraged too. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who claimed on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to have once been Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u201cbiggest defender on the floor of the United States Senate,\u201d announced shortly after Khashoggi\u2019s death that Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, \u201chas got to go.\u201d The crown prince denies a role in Khashoggi\u2019s death; the U.N. sees credible evidence warranting further investigation.\n\nDespite the backlash directed at the kingdom, the Saudis haven\u2019t faced serious consequences for the slaying of Khashoggi or its slaughter of civilians in Yemen. That is thanks in large part to one man \u2014 President Trump. He has loudly and emphatically defended Saudi Arabia at every opportunity. According to a July House Oversight committee report, he recently considered giving Riyadh nuclear technology without appropriate safeguards to prevent nuclear proliferation, in part at the behest of the chair of his inaugural committee, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. He has also tweeted at least a fleeting willingness to go to war with Iran on Saudi Arabia\u2019s behalf following the attacks on Saudi oil fields, something the American public overwhelmingly doesn\u2019t support.\n\nTrump\u2019s principal argument for siding with the Saudis has to do with the alleged economic benefits of U.S. arms sales to the kingdom. It all began during his May 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia, when he touted a purported $110-billion arms deal that would mean \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs\u201d for Americans. The deal itself, according to the Washington Post \u201cFact Checker,\u201d was considerably smaller than the administration claimed, with much of it composed of sales already approved under the Obama administration or speculative offers that would happen years from now, if ever. And a report from our organization, the Center for International Policy, found the president\u2019s claims of U.S. jobs tied to Saudi arms deals were greatly exaggerated \u2014 10 to 20 times the actual number.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe facts, however, have not prevented Trump from vetoing a series of congressional measures aimed at ending U.S. military support and arms sales to the region.\n\nWhile Trump appears to be the commander-in-chief of Saudi Arabia\u2019s public relations efforts in the U.S., he\u2019s far from alone. Even with several firms abandoning the influence machine the Saudi\u2019s had assembled before Khashoggi\u2019s killing, the Saudi lobby is still represented in the U.S. by more than 20 \u201cK Street\u201d firms, according to the Department of Justice . This includes influential operators such as Squire Patton Boggs and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck \u2014 whom the Saudis paid over $1 million on Oct. 4, 2018, just two days after Khashoggi was killed at the Saudi consulate \u2014 and the McKeon Group, whose namesake, former Rep. Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), was once the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nSaudi Arabia has also dramatically increased funding to many of the lobbying and public relations firms that stayed with them post-Khashoggi. In fact, one firm \u2014 Qorvis Communications, the Saudis\u2019 longtime public relations gurus in America \u2014 received nearly $18 million from the kingdom in just the first three months after Khashoggi\u2019s death, more than most countries spend on all of their lobbying activities for an entire year. Washington lobbyists acting as agents of Saudi Arabia have also continued to give lavishly to House and Senate campaigns, in some cases on the same day they met with members of Congress or their staffs to discuss the kingdom.\n\nAll of this has served a critical function for the Saudi regime: maintaining enough support in Congress to ensure Trump\u2019s vetoes aren\u2019t overridden, which keeps the U.S. government from punishing the Saudis for Khashoggi\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s protection of Saudi Arabia is at best a temporary shield. Veterans, peace and human rights groups, and other interest groups have been pushing Congress to block U.S. military support for the kingdom by invoking provisions of the War Powers Resolution and making amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act. Human rights organizations also have pushed beneficiaries of Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s private charity \u2014 among them the New York Public Library and the United Nations \u2014 to abandon their connection to the foundation, which the crown prince uses as a propaganda platform.\n\nYet, one year after Khashoggi\u2019s killing, and 4 \u00bd years into the brutal Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, Congress and the president have yet to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. That cannot be allowed to stand. On the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s murder, we owe it to him to stand up to the Saudi lobby and the president, and once and for all punish the Saudi government for what it has done.\n\nBen Freeman is the director of the Foreign Influence Transparency Initiative at the Center for International Policy.
