I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it,\u201d Sanders said in the interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings.\u201d\n\nSitting alongside his wife Jane, Sanders struck a more defiant tone as he made clear that he had no intention of leaving the race. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win this thing.\u201d\n\nBut just a day prior, he sounded cautious. Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington, Vermont, Sanders said he had felt \u201cmore fatigued than I usually have been\u201d during the previous two months of his campaign and that he \u201cshould have listened to those symptoms\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d he said \u2013 a striking concession for a candidate who prides himself on keeping a relentless schedule, even by the standards of a presidential campaign.As a leading candidate in a tightening race for the Democratic nomination, the incident has invited fresh scrutiny of Sanders\u2019 age \u2013 and the viability of his presidential campaign. At 78, if he won the 2020 election against Donald Trump, he would be the oldest president ever to take office.\n\nSanders aides announced last Wednesday that he had experienced chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas the evening before and was taken to the hospital, where he had two stents inserted to open a blocked artery. After he left the hospital, the campaign released a statement from his doctor saying he had been diagnosed with a myocardial infarction \u2013 a heart attack.\n\nSanders said he had been aware he had a heart attack on Tuesday night, when he entered the hospital. Over the next few days, he said, the campaign was trying to \u201cto understand what, in fact, is going on\u201d, and to discuss the episode with his doctor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie and Jane Sanders on the campaign trail in Florida in June.

Sanders has been a driving force behind the major policy debates, challenging party orthodoxy on healthcare, higher education and climate change. Days before, he reported a third-quarter fundraising total of $25.3m, the largest of any Democratic candidates. But he has lost ground to Elizabeth Warren, an ideological ally who has emerged as the top-polling progressive alternative to former vice-president Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThere is a heavier burden now on Bernie and his campaign to show they can win,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist.\n\nBut a less hectic schedule could help focus his campaign\u2019s message as he returns to the trail after several days, she said.\n\n\u201cIf they held one marquee event a day, maybe there\u2019s more space for his message to resonate,\u201d Katz said, adding: \u201cA slowed-down Bernie Sanders is still a much more active candidate than what we\u2019ve seen from a lot of other presidential campaigns.\u201d\n\nSanders is recuperating at home, and it is unclear whether he will return to the campaign trail before the fourth Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday, which he plans to attend.\n\nThe high-stakes appearance will test Sanders\u2019 durability over the course of the three-hour primetime event as he shares a stage with 11 of his leading rivals on the same stage. With millions of viewers watching, the debate offers an opportunity for Sanders to confront the inevitable questions about his health and the viability of his campaign.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to come back in the debate and show the American people and especially Democratic primary voters that he\u2019s fully capable of performing and fulfilling the job of being president of the United States,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a veteran Democratic strategist and a former adviser to Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders just outraised the entire field,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s still a formidable candidate.\u201d\n\nAs Sanders recovers, the staff and volunteers have been stepping up to keep the campaign moving \u201cfull speed ahead\u201d. The campaign introduced a new policy this week that would reduce the influence of corporate money in American politics. In a campaign video released on Thursday, Sanders sought to rally his supporters.\n\n\u201cI got to tell you, that even as I sat and lay down in that hospital bed in Las Vegas, this issue of the struggle that we are engaged in just, you know, permeated my mind,\u201d Sanders said, speaking directly into the camera. \u201cWe are going to win this struggle. History is on our side.\u201d\n\nSurrogates for the senator have fanned out across the early states, and Congressman Ro Khanna, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, said he believes the incident has galvanized supporters.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying I\u2019ll do an extra shift. I\u2019ll talk to more voters. I\u2019ll pick some of the slack while Sanders recuperates,\u201d said Khanna, who stepped in for Sanders at events in Iowa last weekend.\n\nThe California Democrat said the episode is an opportunity for Sanders to connect the man and the message \u2013 a feature of politicking that has always been difficult for the senator.\n\n\u201cHe can use this experience to show that he will give everything he has to this fight,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cThat, for him, it\u2019s more than just a campaign for the presidency. It\u2019s the cause of his life.\u201d\n\nOliver Laughland contributed to this story", "description": "\u2018We\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u2019 2020 candidate says, a week after having a heart attack", "authors": ["Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a197448ba5b6630b1696301feb21e811e50c0a9/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b84ba659fe88dfe59830bb9b0b144bea", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
