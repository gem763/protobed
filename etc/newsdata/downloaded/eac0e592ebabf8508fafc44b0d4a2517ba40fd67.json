They are not working on plans to close the open pit,\u201d said a Rio spokesman.\n\nRio and the listed subsidiary through which Oyu Tolgoi is owned, Turquoise Hill Resources, declined to say this week whether they expect the open pit to be cashflow positive in the 2020 calendar year.\n\nNeither company was willing to disclose this week what copper and gold grades they expect to extract from the open pit in 2020, despite the start of the year being 12 weeks away.\n\nWhile precise grade guidance was not available, the companies have made clear that the open pit is moving into lower grade material than it has extracted over the past year.\n\nIt is believed gold grades in the open pit will average around 0.25 grams per tonne in coming years; a far cry from the 1.4 grams per tonne extracted in recent years when the open pit was working through its \"gold core\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSources said the companies were exploring ways to \"resequence\" the Oyu Tolgoi mine plan to maximise cashflow from the open pit over the next two years.\n\nCash flow from the open pit has never been more important for Turquoise Hill, given the funding challenges the company now faces on the back of the delays to the underground project.\n\nMany investors fear Turquoise Hill will have to conduct a dilutive equity raising within the next two years, with Turquoise Hill chief executive Ulf Quellmann saying the company has enough liquidity to last it until the end of 2020.\n\nMr Quellman has suggested cash flow from the open pit will complement the project finance that Turquoise Hill has on hand to sustain itself until the end of 2020, and as recently as September 9 Turquoise Hill said in an investor briefing that cash flows from the open pit were ''steady''.\n\n''Expect to continue to generate additional cash from ongoing open-pit operations,'' said Turquoise Hill in the September briefing, without specifying whether it was referring to 2019 or 2020.\n\nThe best chance for the open pit to generate cashflow in 2020 appears to be continued appreciation of the gold price, which has soared in 2019 on signs of a global economic slowdown.\n\nFinancing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the same macro economic factors have hurt the copper price, which has fallen from more than $US2.90 per pound in April to $US2.54 per pound on Friday.\n\nRio and Turquoise Hill have started conversations with lenders over an increase to the $US4.4 billion finance package awarded to the project by a consortium of lenders in 2015.\n\nThat consortium included ANZ, NAB and the Australian government's Export Finance and Insurance Corporation.\n\nBut that process of seeking more funding is caught between the rock that is the Mongolian government's desire for a better deal on the project, and the hard place that is the conditions lenders will require to give them comfort before they hand over more money.\n\nMeanwhile, changes to the leadership of the underground project were confirmed this week, with underground project director Michel Charron finishing his three-year stint on the project and returning to Canada where he will take on another project role within Rio.\n\nCharles Zimmerman, the managing director of aluminium, copper and diamonds projects, will take on greater accountability Oyu Tolgoi's underground project.\n\nTwo Australians, Andrew Duff and Chris Aitchison will also take on more responsibility, focusing on surface construction and underground mine development respectively.", "description": "Rio Tinto's Mongolian copper mine faces a tough year ahead, as delays to the high grade underground mine leaves the open pit exposed to sliding grades.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5521%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5e0cfa963444e1115f8a34f3623245a3fc62072d", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
