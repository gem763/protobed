I think everyone\u2019s fear is to try to get out of your pool.\u201d", "description": "Wales coach Warren Gatland said they would have to run players out of their usual positions after a bruising 29-17 win over Fiji booked a place in the World Cup quarter-finals but left flyhalf Dan Biggar groggy with a second head injury.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438858174&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981B7", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
