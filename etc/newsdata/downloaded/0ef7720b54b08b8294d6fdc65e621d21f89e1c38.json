Now Trump wants the CIA employee, whose anonymity is protected by law, to be revealed. \u201cThis country has to find out who that person was, because that person is a spy, in my opinion,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nWhistleblowers are often punished, even as federal officials say they support the right of workers to report wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cAs a rule, whistleblowing is an act of professional suicide,\u201d said Tom Devine, legal director of the Government Accountability Project that defends whistleblowers. The threat of retaliation \u201cexponentially increases when Trump calls you a spy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just government retaliation that concerns Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, which Fitzgerald helped found. \u201cI\u2019m frankly terrified for his personal safety,\u201d she said, citing Trump\u2019s words. She\u2019s also worried because of the $50,000 reward for \u201cinformation relating to the identity of the \u2018Trump Whistleblower\u2019 \u201d offered by Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, according to the Washington Examiner, which previously branded them \u201cright-wing smear merchants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike Fitzgerald, who died in February, more recent federal employees felt the whip of retribution for exposing government wrongdoing. We contacted three former national security whistleblowers whose stories of official revenge are a frightful warning to the CIA staffer. Yet all three would do it again, in service to their country.\n\nJane Turner was an FBI agent when she spoke about malfeasance related to investigations of crimes against Indian Country children and thefts by fellow agents from New York City\u2019s Ground Zero. She was forced out in 2003 following a series of retaliatory measures. She fought back. A 2015 Government Accountability Report critical of FBI whistleblower procedures said the Justice Department \u201cultimately found in her favor in 2013 \u2014 over 10 years later.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas the destruction of my career and family worth the excruciating time and money, ostracism and vilification? No,\u201d she said Wednesday. \u201cWas standing up and doing the ethical, legal and moral whistleblowing the right thing? Yes. Would I do it again? My moral and legal compass would not allow any different course of action.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer advice to the CIA whistleblower: \u201cCarefully weigh the costs to you, your family and your career when deciding whether to blow the whistle. And document, document, document \u2026 because the hierarchy will lie.\u201d\n\nTeresa Chambers was the U.S. Park Police chief. Highly ranked, she didn\u2019t consider herself a whistleblower, yet was treated with the scorn that too often greets renegade truth-tellers. Her sin \u2014 advocating for greater agency resources.\n\nHer on the record remarks for a 2003 Washington Post article led to her firing. Her comments, about the need for more officers to patrol the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and federal lands in the District, seemed innocuous. But they led to retaliation from her supervisors, she said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWithout warning, I was catapulted from a rising star who had devoted her life to her profession and was transformed to a shunned employee who was stripped of her gun and badge and paraded past her co-workers as she was escorted away by armed DOI (Department of Interior) employees,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt betrayed by my superiors \u2014 the very people who often praised my leadership and accomplishments.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIntelligence community employees, like the CIA staffer, have fewer whistleblower protections than other feds, like Chambers. Nonetheless, \u201cmy experience is that those protections are often in written words only,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of the steps I had to take were a farce ... It became clear to me early on that the actual facts in my case did not seem to matter to anyone along the way.\u201d\n\nChambers was reinstated after an emotionally draining fight \u2014 \u201cseven years one month, and 26 days after my nightmare began\u201d \u2014 against the government she protected. Despite the retribution, she is \u201cabsolutely\u201d glad she spoke out.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTelling the truth, especially as a police official, is always the right thing to do,\u201d she said.\n\nBut it comes with a steep price.\n\nSo steep that \u201cI'd first try to talk them out of it because hell on Earth will come at them making you lose everything and destroy your family.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s the advice Robert MacLean has for the CIA whistleblower.\n\nMacLean, a former air marshal, won the first federal whistleblower case before the Supreme Court in 2015. Yet, now he\u2019s driving Uber and Lyft, his legal victory frustrated by a series of Transportation Department maneuvers.\n\nHe was fired in 2006 after complaining, first internally and later in a leak to MSNBC, about a decision to temporarily cancel overnight air marshal missions to save on hotel bills, days after an agency warning about potential hijacking.\n\nAD\n\nWould he blow the whistle again? \u201cIn a heartbeat. I was a sworn law enforcement officer, exposing violations of law and dangers to public safety.\u201d\n\nBut, MacLean added, \u201cit wrecked my career and continues to make my children miserable. Many family members lecture me that I should've remained silent because nobody cares and the wrongdoers are never held accountable.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nReport says procedures put a chilling effect on potential FBI whistleblowers\n\nSupremes protect federal whistleblowers\n\nU.S. Park Police Chief Chambers is reinstated\n\nAD", "description": "Three national security whistleblowers suffered professionally and personally, yet they would expose federal wrongdoing again, saying it was the right thing to do.
