Stalkerware is software that allows you to spy on someone's phone or tablet. They are often advertised to parents who wish to track the online activity of their child, or bosses looking to snoop on their employees. Typically, stalkware allows you to remotely intercept messages, photos, browsing history, GPS coordinates and even phone call data. They work by pairing an online account to an app that is installed on the device you wish to spy on. Users can then remotely access the phone's data without the owner knowing they are under surveillance. Stalkerware apps are technically legal, but have stirred controversy in the past when people have employed them for illicit spying.\n\nThe FTC commissioners vote 5-0 to issue an administrative complaint against Retina-X.\n\nAdministrative complaints are issued when the commission has reason to believe a law has been or currently is being violated.\n\nA settlement proposal will be offered to Retina-X, allowing the company to begin selling the apps again if it can guarantee their use will be limited to children, employees, or adults who have provided written consent.\n\nIn 2017, anonymous hackers accessed the stored data Retina-X kept from its users, adding concerns that the apps not only might be used to spy on a user without their knowledge but that the company's security devices around the data collected from that surveillance was insecure.\n\nThe FTC alleged that Retina-X was violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a law from 1998 that requires online service provides ensure the data of children 13 and under is kept secure.\n\nTeenShield (pictured above) is pitched to parents worried about their teens behavior, including what sorts of photos they might be taking with their smartphones\n\nIn 2018, a bug in another monitoring app, Xnore--which could be used to monitor another person's Facebook messages and calls--was hacked, exposing the data of its 28,000 users.", "description": "Citing privacy concerns, the Federal Trade Commission announced it would block the sale of three 'stalking' apps, including MobileSpy, PhoneSherriff, and TeenShield.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20058172-0-image-a-30_1571782319315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
