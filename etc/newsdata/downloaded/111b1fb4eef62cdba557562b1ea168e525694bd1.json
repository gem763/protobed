The Italian government has so far refused to say a word about a trip to the capital last week by Attorney General William Barr to meet with Italian intelligence officers as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to discredit the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pompeo confirmed in a news conference in Rome that \u201cI was on the phone call\u201d between Trump and the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that is at the heart of an impeachment inquiry into Trump. But he also said \u201cI am looking forward to meeting all my cousins\u201d during his visit to Pacentro on Thursday.\n\nPompeo\u2019s trip to Italy, which includes a meeting with Pope Francis on Thursday, has been on his official calendar for weeks, and it has focused on tariffs, Libya and Iran sanctions.\n\nBut Pompeo could not escape the impeachment inquiry consuming Washington as he dashed off an angry letter to House Democrats who had issued subpoenas on an expedited timetable to State Department officials involved with Ukraine. (\u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d he said Wednesday.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy shake hands during a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, July 30, 2018. (Doug Mills/The New York Times) More\n\nThe visit, however, could also serve as a welcome getaway from the impeachment inquiry, at least for a day.\n\nPompeo has carved out time to drive east to Pacentro, his great-grandfather\u2019s hometown, where Angelilli said the Trump official is the second most famous export after Gaetano Ciccone, the paternal grandfather of Madonna.\n\nPompeo\u2019s maternal side traces back to nearby Caramanico Terme, which in 2017 seized on his elevation to director of the CIA to enlist his help in solving the great cold case of 1950.\n\n\u201cUnknown thieves stole the ancient statue of Our Lady of the Assumption,\u201d the then-mayor wrote to Pompeo, imploring his assistance. \u201cWe hope you will not find our request inappropriate or strange.\u201d\n\nAn altogether different, and much more recent, Italian mystery has drawn the intense interest of the Trump administration.\n\nIn his efforts to discredit the Russia report of former special counsel Robert Mueller, Trump sent Barr in search of a little-known, long-missing, Maltese professor who has figured prominently in unsubstantiated theories about how the Russia investigation got started.\n\nJoseph Mifsud, a former political science faculty member at Link Campus University, a school in Rome, is best known for telling a Trump campaign adviser that the Russians had \u201cthousands\u201d of emails belonging to Hillary Clinton. The tip, when relayed to Australia\u2019s top diplomat in London, and eventually to the FBI, helped plant the seeds for Mueller\u2019s investigation.", "description": "ROME -- The \"ancestral homeland\" in Italy's Abruzzo region that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was looking forward to visiting on Thursday barely had enough notice to organize a welcoming ceremony.\"It all happened so fast,\" said Guido Angelilli, the mayor of Pacentro,", "authors": ["Jason Horowitz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/l5AL2cifhtPB6bw3ancACQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/68867bd156f20e4fd78dfd499d9431fb", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
