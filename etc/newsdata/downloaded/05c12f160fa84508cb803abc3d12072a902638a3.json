Only problem is, Andrew, you realize, you\u2019re going to have to keep escalating your stunts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this rate, in six months he\u2019s going to have to go full Tom Cruise,\u201d Noah said.\n\nYang was quick to own it, sharing his own version of Noah\u2019s clip alongside a hint there was something planned for Thursday\u2019s debate:\n\nHe stoked the suspense throughout the week with other possible clues:\n\nIt seems to me that ninja-style headwear makes everything cooler. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nFor those wondering I will be crowdsurfing in sandals at Thursday\u2019s debate. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nTwo words for the debate stage tomorrow night: Gold chain. \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nWhen I see an eight-foot rim I know exactly what to do. \ud83d\ude00 pic.twitter.com/IFVB4EIiRH \u2014 Andrew Yang (@AndrewYang) September 11, 2019\n\nHuffPost has contacted Yang\u2019s campaign for comment.\n\nShould Yang\u2019s teases pan out on Thursday, it won\u2019t be his first time sending shockwaves with his debate performance. He appeared without a tie in previous debates, making him the first male candidate to do so at a national debate on live television.", "description": "The presidential hopeful has dropped a few hints that he might wear a gold chain, crowd-surf in sandals or perhaps even rock ninja-style headwear.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d799a552300001c055172de.jpeg?cache=kiawiq8ssb&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
