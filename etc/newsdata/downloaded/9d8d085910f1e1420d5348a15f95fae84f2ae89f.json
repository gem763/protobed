In the clip, the \"bully\" is seen holding the boy, who looks younger than him, by his shirt as he pushes and throws him to the ground. The boy tries to defend himself as bystanders stand by and laugh.\n\nThe pupil's grandfather, Nkagisang Maduo, has accused the school, popularly known as Monnas, of attempting to sweep the incident under the carpet.\n\nEducation MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school on Friday to establish the circumstances surrounding the fight.\n\n\"All I can say is that we're not happy with the school's manner of dealing with the incident and we are grateful for the MEC's intervention, because we felt the school was very biased in dealing with the matter,\" Maduo said.\n\n'48 hours to motivate'\n\n\n\nHe added that there was a serious challenge of \"racism and bullying\" at the school, according to reports from his grandson.\n\nLesufi met with the school management and student governing body (SGB), where he was informed that the incident was the second round of a fight that had taken place earlier in the month, on August 8.\n\nThe department has asked the school to gather the facts of the two incidents and compile a report within 48 hours.\n\nAll pupils who were involved in the fight have also been given 48 hours to motivate in writing why they should not be suspended.\n\n\"Following the report, an urgent disciplinary hearing will be conducted and it's on the basis of that hearing that [we] will know the outcome,\" Lesufi said.\n\nHe said that the school had not appropriately dealt with the case, adding that there were also misrepresentations of the facts surrounding the fight.\n\n'Majority of pupils disciplined'\n\nBefore any action was decided on, the department would wait for all affected parties to submit their versions of the incident. This as there had been various issues relating to bullying, drugs and racism at the school, Lesufi said.\n\n\"For example, the school did not formally report the matter to the district and department, and that's a serious breach of our protocols,\" he said.\n\nDespite growing incidents of violence in schools, Lesufi maintained that the majority of pupils in the province were \"disciplined\".\n\n\"I am not trying to say that one incident is not too many, but the reality is that majority of our children are disciplined to be quite frank.\n\n\"But indeed, we have to act decisively where we pick up those who are not disciplined.\"\n\nAccording to a report by Krugersdorp News, the fight between the pupils was stopped by a school staff member and matric council member, the school said in a statement.\n\nThe matter was then handed over to the school's head of discipline, Niekie van Blerk.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
