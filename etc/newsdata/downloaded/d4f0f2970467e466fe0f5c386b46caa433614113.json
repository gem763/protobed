I was desperate to get some answers.\n\n\"Within ten minutes, they confirmed I have two uteruses, two cervixes and two vaginas - I felt so happy to finally know what is wrong.\"\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\n(Image: Caters News Agency)\n\nIn August 2017, Molly-Rose had an operation for the longitudinal septum to be removed at the University College of London Hospital.\n\nShe says it would do 'more harm than good' for doctors to attempt to remove any of her doubled reproductive organs.\n\nOptimistic Molly-Rose adds: \"Although I may face some complications when I am ready to start a family as there is a high chance of miscarrying - at least I can now plan ahead as I am aware.\n\n\"I tend not to dwell on my condition, and I will cross that bridge when I get there.\n\n\"If I wasn't persistent, then I would still be clueless, and I am sharing my story to raise awareness for other girls and women who may going through the same.\"", "description": "Molly-Rose Taylor discovered that she had uterus didelphys after researching the condition online and asking for a vaginal scan", "authors": ["Lucy Notarantonio", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Caters News Agency"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20588624.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-WOMAN-HAS-TWO-SETS-OF-REPRODUCTIVE-ORGANS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
