This is good for China, good for the US and good for the whole world,\u201d Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng said in a statement Thursday, the South China Morning Post reported. But China is willing to agree to a partial deal that would include \u201cprogress in the direction of canceling all tariffs,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the deal announced Friday at the White House, which officials from both countries are still discussing, China would agree to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products. Trump has said that China\u2019s commitment was between $40 to $50 billion each year. In addition, Trump said that China would take action on certain intellectual property disputes. The president has regularly voiced discontent over China\u2019s policies on forced technology sharing, which he has said amount to intellectual property theft. In return for China\u2019s concessions, the U.S. has agreed to suspend a tariff increase set to take place this week.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
