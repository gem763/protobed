The so-called \"news organization\" knew they were in the wrong when they rewrote the headline numerous times after being called out.\n\n\"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48\" was the original headline.\n\nThen it was \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Islamic State's 'terrorist-in-chief,' dies at 48.\"\n\nAnd the final headline: \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48.\"\n\nThe Washington Post has now changed its description of ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from \u201cTerrorist in Chief\u201d to \u201cAustere Religious Scholar\u201d to \u201cExtremist Leader\u201d pic.twitter.com/h899LvZVLX \u2014 Jerry Dunleavy (@JerryDunleavy) October 27, 2019\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News' Martha MacCallum, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, slammed the Washington Post for their obituary blunder. According to Conway, the Post would write a vile and disgusting obituary \u2013 the very kind that al-Baghdadi deserves \u2013 if he was a member of the Trump administration.\n\n\"Look, I just want to say this last thing on behalf of the president of the White House. This obituary was a disgrace and I would ask The Washington Post to close your eyes and pretend that al-Baghdadi worked in the Trump White House and go rewrite the obituary. I bet you would not be as kind.\"\n\nConway is onto something. The leftist mainstream media is quick to capitalize on and disgrace members of the Trump administration but the Washington Post can't even call a terrorist exactly what he is... a terrorist. It's sad and rather sickening that this news organization tip toes around the word, as if it's controversial to call this man a terrorist. He kidnapped, rapped, killed and beheaded people. And some of those killings were even recorded and broadcasted throughout the world. If that isn't the definition of terrorism, then what is?", "description": "She's absolutely correct..10/29/2019 2:09:36AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/23/0a8332a5-1d6a-4298-9ee9-6a4d97000b0a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
