He\u2019d managed to see off stiff-as-an-oar James Cracknell and Charleston-slaughtering Anneka Rice but now the final whistle was blown on his Strictly tournament.\n\nThe jive definitely wasn\u2019t David\u2019s dance. It can be tricky for tall celebrities and at a leggy 6ft 5in, his effort was leaden, lumpen and littered with mistakes. In a supremely awkward moment on Saturday night, guest judge Alfonso Ribeiro got David to scream to let out his feelings. When he had to reprise that jive here, he was probably screaming internally too.\n\nStill, the shy sportsman came out of his shell during his Strictly experience. His football-themed foxtrot, lacklustre paso doble and Batman American smooth over the first three weeks were tentative and hesitant, highlighting his lack of a performance background.\n\nHowever, he was transformed last week for his jazzy quickstep, \u201cgobsmacking\u201d the judges with his \u201cmiraculous\u201d improvement, boosting his score by 11 points and reaching the dizzy heights of mid-table. That remains his finest Strictly moment. The jive would prove his undoing but David was a gracious loser and utter gent.\n\nIn Strictly\u2019s pantheon of glittery goalkeepers, he was outperformed by series four\u2019s Peter Schmeichel but outlasted series eight\u2019s Peter Shilton. So let\u2019s call it a draw.", "description": "The two dad dancers at the foot of the scoreboard slugged it out for survival.", "authors": ["Michael Hogan", "Victoria Coren Mitchell", "Flic Everett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213609535-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM3F4J5q1UP41khh_YGSE8sVs90OxqHKTyxeiP60zZeM.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
