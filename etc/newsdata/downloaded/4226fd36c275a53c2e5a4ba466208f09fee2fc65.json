They were also told their brains are smaller than men\u2019s and not to talk to a man face to face because that was intimidating.\n\n\u201cLet me start by saying how deeply I regret the negative association that this program has had on EY in the media, and to acknowledge that mistakes have been made,\u201d Grier said in the email.\n\nThe first woman to lead the company in the U.S., Grier also sent alumni a link to a video discussing the \u201cPower-Presence-Purpose\u201d program. Initially about five minutes long, the video was shortened later in the day, in part to remove remarks that were highly critical of the media.\n\nGrier called media characterizations of the company\u2019s culture \u201cunfair and misleading.\u201d She also appeared to take a swipe at HuffPost and the other news reports released this week. \u201cThe objective of the media is to create news and to attract clicks, and there is no doubt that this story was done with that objective exclusively in mind,\u201d Grier said. Those remarks were edited out of a subsequent version of the video.\n\n\u201cWe celebrate differences and authenticity and the courage of conviction, and we encourage bold leadership and a culture of belonging,\u201d she said.\n\nGrier said only a few women at EY had ever participated in the program \u2014 fewer than 1%, she writes \u2015 and that it had not gone through an appropriate review at the firm. \u201cThis was an unfortunate breakdown in our processes,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the video, Grier \u2015 who is No. 38 on Fortune\u2019s list of the most powerful women \u2015 said she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by some of the \u201coffensive\u201d content in the program.\n\nShe said if she\u2019d taken the advice offered to women in the presentation, she likely wouldn\u2019t have made it to the top.\n\n\u201cHad I heeded those aspects of the program, I can assure you that I would not be sitting here today as your U.S. chair,\u201d she said in the video.\n\nFor its story on Monday, HuffPost shared the 55-page PPP presentation with three experts in women and leadership \u2015 two academics and one consultant \u2015 who have all worked on these kinds of trainings. All agreed the program was threaded throughout with outdated and debunked stereotypes about women.\n\nAt least two EY alumni HuffPost spoke with on Wednesday said they were not won over by Grier\u2019s note.\n\n\u201cEh, if you could see me roll [my] eyes,\u201d said a former female executive director with the firm in an email to HuffPost, who did not want to include her name due to fear of career reprisals for openly criticizing her former employer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about what I would expect them to say,\u201d the former executive director said. \u201cIt\u2019s a focused response to what they\u2019ve tried to minimize as a specific error with a specific program, while being seriously tone deaf on the larger cultural issue.\u201d\n\nShe emphasized that overall, EY leaders probably do believe they are doing all they can for women, but when you look at the numbers, there is clearly a problem.\n\nJust 25% of EY\u2019s partners and principals in the U.S. are women, according to data EY shared with HuffPost. The company emphasized to HuffPost on Wednesday that women comprise nearly 40% of Grier\u2019s executive team.\n\nHave you worked at EY or do you work at EY? Tell us your story.
