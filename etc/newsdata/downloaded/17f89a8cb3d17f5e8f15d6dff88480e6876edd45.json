That's still the goal,\" Marcus told Reuters when asked if the recent departure of several major partners from the project would delay the planned 2020 launch.\n\n\"We've always said that we wouldn't go forward unless we have addressed all legitimate concerns and get proper regulatory approval. So it's not entirely up to us,\" he said.", "description": "Facebook open to currency-pegged stablecoins for Libra project", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9J0NU_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
