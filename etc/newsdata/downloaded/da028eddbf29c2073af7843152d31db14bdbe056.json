A few businesses and homes boarded up on the coastal island. (Stephen B. Morton/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nYou may not be in the path of Hurricane Dorian, but it\u2019s still a good idea to be financially prepared for a storm.\n\nThink of your financial life as going to the beach. One of the things you need to have on hand is sunscreen. You can\u2019t see the harmful UV rays, but if you stay out too long without protection, you can get burned \u2014 sometimes badly.\n\nI learned the hard way how important it is to protect myself from the sun. On my first trip to the Caribbean \u2014 Jamaica \u2014 not only did I neglect to put on sunscreen, I applied baby oil, because I wanted a very bronze tan while keeping my skin moisturized.\n\nStop laughing.\n\nI was a young adult. And growing up, we never went to the beach, so I didn\u2019t know. Plus, I foolishly believed the myth that African Americans don\u2019t sunburn.\n\nI woke up the next day in so much pain I cried. I peeled for days as my skin began to heal.\n\nLesson learned: Prepare and protect yourself.\n\nHurricane Dorian has become an all-out disaster and one that not even the most prepared could weather without loss or damage. However, as I view the satellite images of the storm, it reminds me of how often people fail to prepare for the financial disasters that are just as unpredictable \u2014 a recession, a job loss or a monster storm.\n\nI shake my head when folks \u2014 who can afford to leave \u2014 ignore the dire warnings from authorities to evacuate believing they can ride out the hurricane. They\u2019re overconfident of their ability to manage in a crisis, much like the people who keep saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got a secure job, so why do I need to save?\u201d Or they use the expression \u201cyou only live once\u201d to justify taking that vacation, when they needed to save their money for an emergency.\n\nThe time in between storms makes us complacent.\n\nWhen Hurricane Maria hit in 2017, you promised to look over your homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. Did you? When was the last time you double-checked what\u2019s covered and what isn\u2019t?\n\nRemember when your relative died and people were scrambling to find the money for the funeral? You vowed you wouldn\u2019t leave such a financial mess for your family to deal with. Yet it\u2019s been a year or two, and you still haven\u2019t gotten around to getting life insurance or increasing the value of the policy that you do have in place. Do you even have a will?\n\nHave you updated your beneficiary designations for your insurance?\n\nYes, your mother was the best person to designate as your beneficiary when you were single, but now that you\u2019re married and have children, make sure you\u2019ve provided for them. If mama doesn\u2019t like your spouse, she may not hand over the money.\n\nDo you have flood insurance? Typically, a basic homeowner\u2019s policy does not cover flooding. Even if you\u2019re not in a high-flood-risk area, you might still need protection. Just one inch of water in a home can cost more than $25,000 in damage, according to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which operates under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nIf your community participates in the NFIP, a policy can be purchased through an insurance agent. Even renters should consider getting flood insurance. The policy your landlord carries probably does not cover damage to your personal possessions.\n\nFor information on flood insurance, go to floodsmart.gov or call NFIP\u2019s Help Center at 800-427-4661.\n\nWhat\u2019s the state of your emergency fund?\n\nWhat if you need to evacuate because of a hurricane, tornado or wildfire? Would you have enough in savings to cover a week or two at a hotel? If a natural disaster knocked out power, do you have enough cash on hand to purchase essentials for a few days?\n\nYou\u2019ve been in a panic about whether a recession is coming, but what have you done to prepare for when it arrives? Because \u2014 now or later \u2014 there will be another recession.\n\nIf you lose your job, how long could you sustain your household? Two months? One? Or maybe things would become dire right away. Think of your emergency savings like the sandbags used when a storm is coming.\n\nHow\u2019s paying off that credit card coming? Get rid of your student loans as quickly as possible. A loss of income may be less catastrophic if a lot of your cash doesn\u2019t have to be used to service debt.\n\nAll the planning in the world may not completely protect you from a hurricane or a major financial disaster. But giving yourself some cover \u2014 like using sunscreen to shield your skin \u2014 can make the recovery a little less painful.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
