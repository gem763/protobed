On one hand, he has alienated the West so thoroughly that he won not a single seat in Alberta and Saskatchewan, largely, say the analysts, based on his handling \u2014 the less charitable would say his mishandling \u2014 of Alberta\u2019s need for a new oil conduit.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just with the dither and delay he has wrought so far. Imagine, rue the reports, what will happen if he completely jettisons the proposed pipeline and all those millions of barrels of tax-generating fossil fuels become land-locked. Worse yet, with his two potential suitors \u2014 the mostly green NDP and the almost-Irish Bloc Quebecois \u2014 both lobbying with various degrees of vigour against Trans Mountain, the chattering class is convinced Alberta\u2019s oil is doomed to remain permanently buried.\n\nOr is it?\n\nIndeed, if the Trudeau fils proved anything in his first term \u2014 and here we need to credit his boyish good looks and the smarmiest smile since PT Barnum \u2014 he knows how to wriggle through keyholes that other politicians can\u2019t even see. More surprising, however, is that I think there\u2019s a good chance that the road to the Trans Mountain\u2019s salvation runs right through both erstwhile accomplices\u2019 forceful promotion of electric vehicles.\n\nTo wit: Trudeau needs, say the sages, the Trans Mountain pipeline if Canada is to remain a country (or at least a nation). Both conjoining parties, on the other hand, have aggressive postures on zero-emissions vehicles. Those would seem diametrically opposed blueprints for Canada\u2019s energy future. But what if \u2014 and see previous comment about wriggling and that smarmy smile \u2014 the be-socked one made one contingent on the other. In other words, Alberta can have its pipeline but only on the condition that Canada adopt a truly aggressive \u2014 in the case of the Bloc\u2019s promotion of Quebec\u2019s ZEV mandate, over the top \u2014 electric vehicle policy.\n\nAs a political maneuver, it is brilliantly Machiavellian. On the one hand, Alberta gets its pipeline, but Big Oil signs its own death warrant, the resultant EV mandate the final nail in fossil-fueled automobile\u2019s coffin. As political intrigue, it would be absolutely captivating: Watching the NDP or Bloc try to justify that which they profess to hate most while Trudeau glides to re-election at their expense will feed Rex Murphy for the next four years. And, as for political theatre, my Lord, what a Godsend \u2014 watching Greta Thunberg\u2019s spite and spittle as she tries to decry a betrayal while being forced to admit Canada would have one of the most progressive EV policies in the world \u2014 right up there with blessed Norway, who just by coincidence also fuels its EV fantasy with the dirty profits from oil \u2014 would be absolutely must-see TV.\n\nAs for which suitor is most likely to respond to Mr. Trudeau\u2019 implorations, I suspect Mr. Singh will get the first date. For one thing, the NDP \u2014 theoretically, at least \u2014 is supposed to care about jobs and the oil industry is nothing if not a Godsend to the un-employed and disenfranchised. The NDP\u2019s election promise of up to $15,000 rebates for EV owners is also easily implemented, the Libs already offering five grand a throw. The prime minister could simply credit his new \u201cpartner\u201d with the bump while simultaneously \u2014 and Lord, I hope Gerald Butts is reading this \u2014 promote it as one of his \u201crevenue neutrals,\u201d the government largesse to enviroweenies offset by the greater revenues from a buoyant Alberta. This is quid pro quo at its best, but, by God, the only winner is Justin Trudeau.\n\nAs for the NDP\u2019s election promise that subsidization would be contingent on said EV being built in Canada, a simple workaround based on parts content rather than actual assembly would give Singh a publicly-palatable talking point. Perhaps more importantly, automakers \u2014 save for Toyota, perhaps, which (rightly) believes that a CO2 reduction mandate is better policy than subventing electric vehicles \u2014 would be happy as clams. If you can\u2019t make money when your product is getting subsidized by $23,000 \u2014 for example, in Quebec, where the province throws in an extra eight grand \u2014 then perhaps it\u2019s time you got out of the auto business.\n\nAn alliance with the Bloc Quebecois would, I suspect, be a little more difficult to consummate. For one thing, Quebecers\u2019 antipathy towards pipelines is core to the province\u2019s politics. For another, Quebec\u2019s policy on EVs is truly onerous. Essentially, La Belle Province mandates that automakers sell a minimum number of plug-ins based on their sales. In 2018, 3.5 per cent of their cars had to be ZEV-compliant. By 2025, that number rises to 22 per cent.\n\nAnd Quebec is quite Draconian in enforcing this mandate, the penalty for every EV not sold around $5,000 per car. So, for a company like Mazda \u2014 who is quite desperate to get the just-revealed MX-30 to Canada as quickly as possible \u2014 that sells roughly 25,000 cars a year to our French cousins, the result was an estimated $4.5 million penalty in 2018. Worse yet, if the MX-30 doesn\u2019t take off, the company estimates they\u2019ll be taxed $15 million by 2021.\n\nIndeed, other than Tesla, it\u2019s doubtful there\u2019s even one automaker that would be able to hit Quebec-like targets nationally.\n\nBut, as poor a policy as punishing automakers might be, it\u2019s an easily sold poor policy. Indeed, standing before a podium and claiming to force \u2014 and don\u2019t the Left Libs love it when corporations are \u201cforced\u201d to do anything \u2014 automakers to sell 450,000 EVs per year may be just the sound-bite that Trudeau needs to revive his flagging leadership. As for the Bloc, it could probably sell Trans Mountain as a pox on Alberta and British Columbia \u2014 Hein, it\u2019s not in our backyard \u2014 while boasting that a made-in-Quebec program is now national policy. They could probably coast on the accolades all the way to the next election.\n\nAutomakers, however, would hate it, literally being forced to sell cars that Canadians have so far been reluctant to buy. Besides, unlike the NDP union, there\u2019s no subsidy sweetner to help them sell cars. The federal government\u2019s current $5,000 subsidy, for instance, will likely have little effect in Saskatchewan \u2014 there were just 84 EVs sold there last year \u2014 but automakers would still be on the hook for $5,000 for every one they didn\u2019t sell. Indeed, other than Tesla, it\u2019s doubtful there\u2019s even one automaker that would be able to hit Quebec-like targets nationally.\n\nOf course, that just adds to allure. In fact, Trudeau \u2014 and whatever paramour falls for his charms \u2014 could claim good fiscal management; after all, one company\u2019s fine is another (government\u2019s) revenue. Hell, Justin could even offer the Bloc some form of covert gratuity \u2014 err, transfer payment \u2014 in gratitude.\n\nWhomever Trudeau chooses as his inamorato, whatever the resultant policy, I suspect there\u2019s an enviroweenie-placating, marketplace-altering policy coming. I really do believe Alberta will get its pipeline, but at what cost?
