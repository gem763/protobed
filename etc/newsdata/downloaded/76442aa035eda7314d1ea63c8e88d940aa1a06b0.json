If you\u2019re working a job that regularly asks you to work beyond what you would consider a standard workday, how do you handle the workload \u2014 not to mention the work/life balance?\n\nAlison Green of Ask A Manager recently asked her readers to weigh in on how to survive 12+ hour days at the office, especially if their jobs require that kind of time commitment for weeks and/or months.\n\nResponses included \u201cask yourself if you\u2019re sure these long hours will lead to better things,\u201d \u201cdetermine what trade-offs you\u2019re willing to live with,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t tell yourself you\u2019ll have a better work/life balance later on; figure out how to get that balance now.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it might be time to find a different job.\n\nThere are exceptions, of course. If you\u2019re in a field where long hours are a component of \u201cpaying your dues,\u201d it can be worth it to hang in there and work your way up \u2014 if \u201cup\u201d is a place you actually want to go. Likewise, if you\u2019re in an industry known for its long hours but you love your job and don\u2019t want to change careers, it\u2019s time for you to figure out how to build a life around your work.\n\nIn terms of practical advice, the Ask A Manager commenters suggested outsourcing household chores, prioritising exercise, taking every break you\u2019re entitled to take (no eating lunch at your desk!), and \u2014 if you\u2019re in a career where long hours are the norm and you want to stay in that career long-term \u2014 finding a friend group with similar work hours and priorities.\n\nThink of it like making new friends as a parent; you can keep your old friends, of course, but those friendships might shift due to your new responsibilities and interests, not to mention the increased demands on your time. You\u2019ll benefit from friends and peers who uniquely understand what you\u2019re going through, so seek them out.\n\nWhat about you? How do you deal with long hours at work? What advice would you offer someone who might be starting a new job that regularly includes 60-80 hour weeks? When should you quit a job (and/or career) that requires long hours, and when should you hang in there?", "description": "Most jobs require occasional overtime or after-hours work, but in some jobs and/or careers, long hours are the norm rather than the exception.
