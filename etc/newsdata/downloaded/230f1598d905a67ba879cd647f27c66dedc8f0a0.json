REUTERS/Amit Dave/Files\n\nThe United States in January imposed the toughest sanctions yet on Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, depriving the OPEC-member nation of the main destination for its crude exports.\n\nIn August, Washington escalated sanctions further by threatening non-U.S. companies with punitive action if they \u201cmaterially assist\u201d Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nThe measures have scared away several of PDVSA\u2019s largest customers and tanker operators, causing a fast accumulation of unsold crude that forced the Venezuelan company last month to reduce output.\n\nA spokesperson for Reliance said on Wednesday it has been supplying Venezuela with fuels, including diesel, permitted under U.S. sanctions and thus it \u201cis able to recommence crude sourcing\u201d in exhange for the refined products.\n\n\u201cThese are actions compliant to U.S. sanctions as crude sourcing against supply of permitted products is allowed,\u201d the spokesperson said in a email to Reuters.\n\nPDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nChina National Petroleum Corp and its units stopped taking Venezuelan oil in August. Others, including Reliance, have recently been buying Venezuelan crude from Russian major Rosneft, according to the documents and vessel tracking information from Refinitiv Eikon.\n\nReliance and the state-run Russian oil company did not respond to requests for comment on these trades.\n\nReliance needs the type of heavy sour crude that Venezuela sells because its refineries are configured to process it. U.S. sanctions on both Venezuela and Iran have made it harder for the refiners to find supplies of these crude grades.\n\nReliance is sending at least two vessels, the very large crude carriers Antonis I. Angelicoussis and Maran Castor, to Venezuela\u2019s Jose port for loading in late October, according to the PDVSA documents.\n\nThe tankers are currently passing the Suez canal, the Refinitiv Eikon data showed.\n\nItaly\u2019s Eni has separately sent the Suezmax tanker Seavoyager to load 1 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey heavy crude in mid-October, according to the same documents.\n\nAsked about the shipment, an Eni spokesman said the last time the Italian company received crude from PDVSA was in late 2018. He did not comment on the cargo allegedly scheduled for October.\n\n\u201cEni confirms that it has been recovering its receivables with PDVSA through crude supplies, in full compliance with all relevant regulations,\u201d the company told Reuters in an email.\n\nThe scheduled exports come at a time when PDVSA desperately needs to draw down almost 39 million barrels of unsold crude inventories that have forced it to reduce output and suspend crude blending while shipping more barrels to its political ally Cuba.", "description": "Indian refiner Reliance Industries Ltd is scheduled to resume loading Venezuelan crude in October after a four-month pause, according to sources and internal documents from PDVSA seen by Reuters, a move that could help Venezuela's state-run company drain its large oil inventories.", "authors": ["Marianna Parraga", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438891119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981JD", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
