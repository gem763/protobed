Another $999,000 in actual damages and $7 million in punitive damages were later added.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to send a message,\u201d the jury foreman only identified as \u201cjuror No. 4\u201d said. \u201cIf you discriminate you are going to pay a big price. \u2026 You can\u2019t defend the indefensible.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
