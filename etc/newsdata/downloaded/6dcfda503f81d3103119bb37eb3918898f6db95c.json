But in this case, the prosecutors deemed it necessary to wait for that case,\" NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said at the time.\n\nDuduzane has also previously dismissed Jonas' claims in an affidavit to the Zondo commission, citing that he met with Jonas because there were rumours that Jonas claimed businessman Fana Hlongwane had blackmailed him, News24 reported.\n\nALSO READ: #StateCaptureInquiry: Duduzane Zuma prepared to give evidence before commission\n\n\"When these rumours started to surface, Mr Hlongwane, in discussion with me, decided to set up a meeting with Mr Jonas in an attempt to clear it up. I met Jonas for the first time at Hyatt Hotel (in Rosebank) as arranged via telephone [discussion]/SMS exchanges between us.\"\n\nDuduzane said the meeting moved to the Gupta residence and that Jonas did not object, express any reservations or display any discomfort about having the meeting there at any stage.\n\nHe said there were no discussions at that meeting about the removal of the finance minister at the time.\n\nDuduzane was also implicated by former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor when she claimed that during a flight to China, it was Duduzane who introduced her to Rajesh Gupta, Hlongwane and another unknown man of Indian descent, News24 reported.\n\nALSO READ: #StateCaptureInquiry: Vytjie Mentor does an about turn on Fana Hlongwane\n\nShe later \u2013 through her lawyers \u2013 amended this version and admitted to incorrectly identifying the man as Hlongwane.\n\nDuduzane has made headlines for his apparent links to the infamous Gupta family and their various businesses.", "description": "Duduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, is expected to appear before the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8877/641c02b9e9a741ca9059040a53e9f1ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
