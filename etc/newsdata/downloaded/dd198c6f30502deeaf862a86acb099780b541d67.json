(AP Photo/Tsafrir Abayov)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fell short of securing a parliamentary majority with his natural religious and nationalist allies in national elections Tuesday, partial results indicated, setting the stage for a period of coalition negotiations that could threaten his political future and even clear the way for him to be tried on corruption charges.\n\nInitial partial results showed challenger Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White party tied with Netanyahu's Likud. While the results do not guarantee that Gantz will be the next prime minister, they signaled that Netanyahu, who has led the country for over 10 years, could have trouble holding on to the job.\n\nAddressing his supporters early Wednesday, Netanyahu refused to concede defeat and vowed to work to form a new government that excludes Arab parties. His campaign focused heavily on attacking and questioning the loyalty of the country's Arab minority \u2014 a strategy that drew accusations of racism and incitement from Arab leaders.\n\n\"In the coming days we will convene negotiations to assemble a strong Zionist government and to prevent a dangerous anti-Zionist government,\" he said. He claimed that Arab parties \"negate the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state\" and \"glorify bloodthirsty murderers.\"\n\nThe partial results released Wednesday by the Central Election Commission were based on 35 percent of the vote counted. The three Israeli TV channels reported the same outcome, based on more than 90 percent of the vote counted, but did not explain the discrepancy with the commission's percentage.\n\nFinal results are expected Wednesday and could still swing in Netanyahu's favor.\n\nAccording to the partial results, the parties of Gantz and Netanyahu received 32 seats each in the 120-member parliament. Likud with its natural allies of religious and ultra-nationalist parties mustered 56 seats \u2014 or five short of the needed majority.\n\nThis means both Likud and Blue and White will have difficulty setting up a governing coalition without the support of Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party. That put Lieberman, a former protege of Netanyahu's who has become one of the prime minister's fiercest rivals, in the position of kingmaker.\n\nArab parties, which have never before sat in an Israeli government, also finished strong, and exit polls predicted they would form the third-largest party in parliament.\n\nAddressing his supporters late Tuesday, a jubilant Lieberman said he saw only \"one option\": a broad, secular coalition with both Blue and White and Likud.\n\n\"We've always said that a unity government is only possible in emergency situations. And I tell you and I tell every citizen today watching us on television: the situation, both security-wise and economically, are emergency situations,\" he said. \"The country, therefore, requires a broad government.\"\n\nEarly Wednesday, Gantz told a cheering rally of supporters that while it was too soon to declare victory, he had begun speaking to potential partners and hoped to form a unity government.\n\n\"Starting tonight we will work to form a broad unity government that will express the will of the people,\" he said.\n\nAttention will now focus on Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin, who is to choose the candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a stable coalition. Rivlin is to consult with all parties in the coming days before making his decision.\n\nAfter that, the prime minister designate would have up to six weeks to form a coalition. If that fails, Rivlin could give another candidate for prime minister 28 days to form a coalition. And if that doesn't work, new elections would be triggered yet again. Rivlin has said he will do everything possible to avoid such a scenario.\n\nLieberman called for an immediate start to negotiations and predicted it could be wrapped up quickly. But such a deal promises to be complicated.\n\nGantz, a former military chief who has presented himself as a unifying figure in a divided nation, has ruled out a partnership with Likud if Netanyahu remains at the helm at a time when he is expected to be indicted on criminal charges.\n\nBut in his speech, he made no such conditions. \"I intend to speak with everyone,\" he said, without mentioning Netanyahu.\n\nLieberman, who leads a nationalist but secular party, is unlikely to sit with Arab parties on the left or ultra-Orthodox religious parties on the right.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fell short of securing a parliamentary majority with his religious and nationalist allies in national elections Tuesday, initial exit polls showed, setting the stage for a period of coalition negotiations that could threaten his political future and clear the", "authors": ["Josef Federman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/niMg6mnLvnPmK0fJcb.YKA--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/64ac93baa763c394595d49c69feb5c65", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
