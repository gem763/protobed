O\u2019Rourke is forsaking a safe seat in Congress and a rising-star career for the longest of odds in an attempt to unseat Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. O\u2019Rourke says that after Donald Trump was elected president, he decided he had to do more in politics than stay put in the House. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nStop me if you\u2019ve seen this movie before.\n\nAnother federal judge has decided that Trump building a border wall through his emergency declaration is illegal. This came from Judge David Briones, a Clinton appointee (shocked face). His reasoning is as specious as the first judge that tried this.\n\nAnother federal judge ruled against President Trump\u2019s use of a \u201cnational emergency\u201d declaration to divert funds for the construction of a border wall on Friday, finding the use of an emergency proclamation \u201cunlawful\u201d because it violated a Congressional budgeting measure from January. \u201cThe Congressional language in the [bill] reveals Congress\u2019s intent to limit the border barrier funding,\u201d wrote Judge David Briones, who was appointed to the federal District Court for the Western District of Texas by former President Bill Clinton.\n\nThere\u2019s so much wrong when you drill down into this.\n\nFirst, how does El Paso County and an activist group (who are the plaintiffs here) have standing to challenge federal agencies using federal funds on federal land? The simple answer is that there\u2019s no legal reason they have standing. Yet, this judge decided they did based on the laughable notion that El Paso County would suffer \u201cdamage to their reputation.\u201d By such a standard, anyone could have standing in any lawsuit against the federal government. It\u2019s just ludicrous.\n\nThe Supreme Court has already slapped down a judge earlier this summer for an equally ridiculous ruling, which bounced back and forth between the 9th circuit originally. In it, the issue of standing came up, as it was yet another activist group doing the suing. The highest court has already ruled that Trump\u2019s use of the emergency declaration is lawful and the gyrations of this judge don\u2019t change that.\n\nIn the end, this will make it\u2019s way up the change and be overturned. But until Chief Justice John Roberts stops sitting on his hands, lower court judges will continue to spit in his face and gum up the judicial system with unsupported rulings such as this. Allowing this ruling to stand for even a day is an affront to our system. It\u2019s not enough to let this spend months going through the system. The Supreme Court should immediately overrule this and then take away the ability for district court judges to make national injunctions.\n\nMeanwhile, the wall keeps going up, whether these rogue judges like it or not.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
