That way you will be able to use the letter again if you have to ask for an appeal.\n\nIf you have any extra evidence you think could help - such as a letter from your doctor, receipt or ticket which shows your whereabouts etc - send a copy of that too.\n\nWhy you should always appeal\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf the mandatory reconsideration doesn't work, keep going. Many cases turned down at mandatory reconsideration but are successful at appeal.\n\nBut you do need to wait until you have asked the DWP for a \u2018mandatory reconsideration\u2019 before appealing.\n\nYou appeal to an independent tribunal called the First Tier tribunal. This is part of the Court Service. It is nothing to do with the DWP.\n\nYou need to use the form SSCS1 to ask for an appeal. You can download it from the HMCTS website.\n\nThe HMCTS will send a copy of your appeal to the DWP and ask them to explain how they came to their decision.\n\nThe DWP must do this within 28 days, although they can ask for an extension. You will receive a copy of their response.\n\nDon\u2019t be put off by the size of it. Keep it safe. You will need it to prepare for your hearing.\n\nMaking a complaint\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nYou can also complain to the Jobcentre and your Member of Parliament (MP) about the service you received or if you sanctioned unfairly.\n\nWrite to their office and send a copy of the letter to the Jobcentre dealing with your case. The Jobcentre may take your complaint more seriously when they see the local MP is involved.\n\nFor example, if you are sanctioned without being given the chance to explain your version of events or if the DWP failed to take into account a health condition when setting your work-related requirements.\n\nAsk your local CAB or other advice service if you need help to write this letter.\n\nYou can find the complete guide to appealing a sanction here.", "description": "It seems even the smallest mistake can see your benefits stopped, blocked or reduced - with millions seeing Universal Credit payments reduced already - this is what you can do about it", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Getty Images Europe", "E", "Newcastle Chronicle", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12216247.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Conservative-Think-tank-Criticises-The-Universal-Credit-Benefit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
