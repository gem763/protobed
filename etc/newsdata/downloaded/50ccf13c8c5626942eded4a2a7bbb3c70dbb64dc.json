But at its minimum, months can go by without a single sunspot and its magnetic field weakens meaning that more energy is being thrown towards the Earth\n\nThe sun entered a solar minimum between 1650 and 1710, causing the Earth to be plunged into a 'deep freeze', said NASA.\n\nWHAT CAUSES THE SOLAR CYCLE? The sun goes through an 11-year cycle where it goes from very active to less active. It is tracked by sunspots and it is currently going through a quiet phase. Researchers from Germany have published a recent study claiming it may be caused by the matching gravitational fields of Venus, Earth and Jupiter. This happens only once every 11.07 years and is likely the cause of switching in the solar cycle. The sloshing of the plasma may only be disturbed by one millimetre but this is enough to alter its movement on a wider scale, they claim.\n\nNASA said: '1650 to 1710, temperatures across much of the Northern Hemisphere plunged when the sun entered a quiet phase now called the Maunder Minimum.\n\n'During this period, very few sunspots appeared on the surface of the sun, and the overall brightness of the sun decreased slightly.\n\n'Already in the midst of a colder-than-average period called the Little Ice Age, Europe and North America went into a deep freeze: alpine glaciers extended over valley farmland; sea ice crept south from the Arctic; and the famous canals in the Netherlands froze regularly\u2014an event that is rare today.'\n\nThe sun swings from a solar maximum to a solar minimum every eleven years.\n\nDuring the maximum, sunspots and solar flares spike in intensity, producing warmer temperatures up and down the planet.\n\nAccording to NASA, solar minimum could also enhance the effects of space weather, potentially disrupting communications and navigation systems, and even causing space junk to \u2018hang around.\u2019", "description": "Active regions on the sun's surface created the grimacing smile and slanted eyes.
