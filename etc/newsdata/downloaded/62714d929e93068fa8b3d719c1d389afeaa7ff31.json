And the number of people aged 80 years or older is projected to triple, from 143 million in 2019 to 426 million in 2050.\n\nThe population aged 65 and older is growing faster than all other age groups, especially as the global birth rate has been plummeting since the second half of the 20th Century. According to the World Health Organization, fertility rates in every region except Africa are near or below what\u2019s considered the \u2018replacement rate\u2019 \u2013 the level needed to keep a population stable. In most high-income countries this hovers around 2.1 children per woman.\n\nThe population isn\u2019t just ageing, though: people are living longer and increasing their \u2018healthspan\u2019 for prolonged health, too. That means that as the population of elders increases, so grows a group of consumers, workers and innovators. In other words, they\u2019re not simply a group that needs services from the \u2018silver economy\u2019, which is aimed solely at older and ageing people \u2013 rather, the ageing population can continue to be full-service participants in the economy at large.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now talking about a new life stage which is as long as the latter part of your adult life,\u201d says Dr Joseph Coughlin, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology AgeLab and author of Longevity Economy: Unlocking the World\u2019s Fastest-Growing, Most Misunderstood Market.", "description": "With increased lifespans, elders are living thousands of days longer.
