In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said British police were still carrying out their verification work and at present are not able to verify the nationalities of the deceased.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the British side can as soon as possible confirm and verify the identities of the victims, ascertain what happened and severely punish criminals involved in the case,\u201d she told a daily news briefing.\n\nHua said that no matter where the victims were from, the case was an enormous tragedy.\n\nThe international community should strengthen their cooperation on fighting illegal immigration and on communication and intelligence to prevent such incidents from happening again, she said.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in London said it has sent a team to Essex to coordinate with the police.\n\nThe widely read Chinese tabloid the Global Times said in a Friday editorial that at the moment it was impossible to say how much responsibility the dead should bear for the tragedy.\n\n\u201cBut such a serious humanitarian disaster has occurred under the eyes of the British and Europeans,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is clear that Britain and relevant European countries have not fulfilled their responsibility to protect these people from such a death.\u201d\n\nEven if the victims were found to have been smuggled into the country, their deaths were not their fault, added the paper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily.\n\n\u201cWe hope that Britain and European countries will put into effect their various commitments to human rights and make due efforts for Chinese people to be free from abuse and sudden death.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBritain appears not to have learned its lesson from the Dover incident two decades ago, it added.\n\n\u201cImagine how thoroughly European countries would take measures if dozens of Europeans were collectively tragically killed in some way,\u201d the paper said.\n\n\u201cCould the British and European people ask themselves why they have not been able to avoid a similar tragedy...Did they take all the serious remedial action that they could have?\u201d", "description": "China called on Britain on Friday to seek \"severe punishment\" for those involved in the deaths of 39 people, believed to be Chinese nationals, found in a truck container near London, as a major state-backed paper said Britain should bear some responsibility for the case.", "authors": ["Ben Blanchard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444876165&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0IK", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
