British 10-year government bond yields recorded their biggest one-day rise in nearly four years.\n\nTo get a done deal, Johnson must master the complexities of the Irish border before getting the approval of Europe\u2019s biggest powers and then sell any deal to the British parliament in which he has no majority and which he suspended unlawfully last month.\n\nJohnson, the face of the 2016 Brexit campaign, made no further comment on the meeting with Varadkar. The details of what, if anything, had been agreed were unclear.\n\nIreland holds the key to any deal. It will have to consent to any solution to the hardest Brexit riddle of all: how to prevent the British province of Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s markets without having border controls.\n\nThe EU fears controls on the 500-km (300-mile) Irish border with Northern Ireland would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which ended three decades of sectarian and political conflict that killed more than 3,600 people.\n\nAlthough Johnson has insisted Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31 even if no agreement is reached, the British parliament has passed a law saying he must request a delay.\n\nIRELAND\n\nHopes of a Brexit deal were dented earlier this week when a Downing Street source said agreement was essentially impossible because German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made unacceptable demands. The EU said Johnson was playing a stupid blame game.\n\nIreland is the biggest issue of disagreement.\n\nIreland's Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson meet in Thornton Manor, Cheshire, Britain October 10, 2019.

Northern Ireland would leave the EU\u2019s customs area along with the rest of the United Kingdom and the province\u2019s institutions would be able to opt to exit the regulatory zone - a step too far for Ireland and the EU.\n\nJohnson and Varadkar said they had discussed consent and customs.\n\nThough Ireland is only about an eighth of the size of the United Kingdom\u2019s $2.8 trillion economy, Dublin is backed by the rest of the EU whose economy - minus the United Kingdom - is worth $15.9 trillion.\n\nWhile Ireland would be very badly affected by a no-deal Brexit, the relative importance of Ireland in the negotiations up-ends centuries of history in which it has had a much weaker hand than London, both before and after winning independence from Britain.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nThe EU\u2019s two most powerful leaders, Germany\u2019s Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, will meet at the Elysee Palace on Sunday ahead of next week\u2019s summit.\n\n\u201cWe want to reduce the negative effects, even if there is a disorderly Brexit, in both countries,\u201d Merkel said.\n\nMacron said on Thursday Britain would have to pay the price should it decide to proceed with a position over Brexit that is unacceptable for the other 27 EU countries.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t want to make any move or make something which is not accepted, they will have to take the responsibility,\u201d he said.", "description": "A Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October to allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said after what he called a very positive meeting with Boris Johnson.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439312146&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991IZ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
