The banned supporters received the penalty for violating Major League Soccer\u2019s Code of Conduct, which states that \u201cUsing (including on any sign or other visible representation) political, threatening, abusive, insulting, offensive language and/or gestures, which includes racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist or otherwise inappropriate language or behavior\u201d is prohibited during matches.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER CLUB BANS UTAH COUPLE FROM WAVING 'BETSY ROSS FLAG' AT GAMES\n\nIn response, the Timbers Army announced they would not fly Timbers flags or use smoke for goal celebrations during the club\u2019s match against Sporting Kansas City on Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur focus this weekend will be on education,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe will use banners with words instead of symbols to remind the world of our unwavering opposition to fascism and to discrimination. We will increase our written communication, both inside the stadium and online, about the reasons for our protest and the larger issues that the Iron Front flag ban represents. We will continue to fight for the League to lift the bans for individuals who displayed Iron Front flags and banners on August 31.\u201d\n\nThe supporters said Timbers officials agreed to meet with them about the bans and other issues they want to be brought to light, including \u201chow to ensure that the stadium and the streets are safe and welcoming for marginalized groups.\u201d\n\nANTIFA\u2019S \u2018IRON FRONT\u2019 SYMBOL BANNED BY MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER\u2019S PORTLAND TIMBERS AND SEATTLE SOUNDERS\n\n\u201cWe want to make something very clear: Our fight is not a fight with the Portland Timbers,\u201d the Timbers Army said.\u201d Our fight is against white nationalists, white supremacists, and others that seek to bring hate and violence to our stadium, city, state, and country. In this moment of darkness, we feel obliged to rally to make the soccer community the inclusive place that the world isn\u2019t for so many of our marginalized communities here in Portland.\u201d\n\nMajor League Soccer recently banned the Timbers and the Seattle Sounders from using the Iron Front symbol, used by Antifa supporters, from being displayed inside the stadiums.\n\nMLS president and deputy commissioner Mark Abbott explained the reasoning behind the league\u2019s action last month.\n\n\u201cI think it was the belief of the league and the clubs that fans are at our games to enjoy the game and that there is a place for third-party political organizations or groups to express their views, but that place isn't within our stadiums,\u201d Abbott told the Associated Press.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe symbol \u2013 composed of three arrows pointing downward and to the left \u2013 has been adopted by some Antifa supporters. It was used in the 1930s by a German group that opposed the Nazis.\n\nFox News\u2019 Dom Calicchio contributed to this report.", "description": "Portland Timbers supporters plan to protest after multiple fans received three-game bans for flying flags bearing Iron Front imagery during a match last weekend, the supporters group said Thursday.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
