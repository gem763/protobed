It was heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cShe was very ill and she felt sick all the time. She was dying of cancer.\n\n\u201cI kept going up to the desk and asking them to go and help her.\n\n\u201cIt had been an hour and nobody had come round. It broke my heart.\u201d\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nMarjorie, who was diagnosed in 1994 and died two years later aged 82, spent a week on the \u201cchaotic\u201d NHS ward in Liverpool where Alison also saw other patients suffering.\n\nShe says the few staff were so overworked she found herself having to help other vulnerable patients.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have any staff. You didn\u2019t get medication until the trolley came round at certain times.\n\n\u201cYou only got attention for food and there was nobody to help feed them.\n\n\"It was a nightmare. There was a lady brought in and she\u2019d had a stroke. It was the saddest thing. This woman had false teeth and she had glasses.\n\n\u201cBecause it had been an emergency she\u2019d forgotten to bring them with her.\n\n\u201cSo this poor woman couldn\u2019t eat. She couldn\u2019t chew. She could only make sounds. She couldn\u2019t see properly. She had no family.\n\n\u201cShe was just sitting in this bed. They came round and gave her tablets, just plonked them on the table next to her, she didn\u2019t even have any water to swallow them with. I had to go over to help feed her. It simply broke your heart.\u201d\n\nAlison, 73, is grateful her mum was eventually moved to a Marie Curie hospice, of which she is an ambassador, instead of staying on the ward.\n\nBut she knows not everyone is as fortunate.\n\n\u201cI feel very passionately about the fact we\u2019re losing our NHS,\u201d says Alison, who grew up in Childwall, Liverpool.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way people can say we\u2019re not because we are. It\u2019s a very slow gradual process.\n\n\u201cThe core of the problem is the private sector creeping in more and more. It started quite a long time ago and it\u2019s ruining Nye Bevan\u2019s wonderful creation.\n\n\u201c Boris Johnson needs to sit down and watch something like this film \u2013 though he never would.\u201d\n\nMore than 60 contributors \u2013 politicians and leading medics \u2013 were interviewed for the documentary Under The Knife which next week begins a series of free screenings around the country.\n\nThose featured include former PM Tony Blair , Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Lord Owen, Gina Miller and Michael Mansfield QC.\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nSays Alison: \u201cI\u2019m only an observer. The woman who made this film, producer Pam Kleinot, she was seeing things changing over the years and how they were failing when she worked in the health service.\n\n\u201cThis film is what we need to highlight all the problems.\n\n\u201cI had private healthcare for years as a back-up. I\u2019ve got rid of it now because I realise that is undermining our health service. They are just making money, they\u2019re not caring for us.\u201d\n\nThe film, supported by campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, also touches on how our NHS will be at the mercy of the American firms after Brexit , particularly if we leave the EU without a deal.\n\nAlison, who voted Remain, is angry at the state of the UK in the aftermath of the referendum... and angry at what it means for the NHS.\n\nShe says: \u201cThe private companies who make drugs will try and keep it to the maximum price so they can make trillions.\n\n\u201cEveryone who has the illness needs the drug but the company are making so much money. This is the reality of what we\u2019re facing.\n\n\u201cWe need a system that is away from profit-making and is focused on giving people proper care, where everyone is equal and entitled to this care.\n\n\u201cI just think our country is a total mess. I am embarrassed to be British.\n\n\u201cThe rest of Europe and the world is looking at us going \u2018What are they doing?\u2019\n\n\u201cSince we joined the EU I\u2019ve loved being European, being part of Europe.With the history we\u2019ve got, after the Second World War, here we are all united.\n\n\u201cIt makes me so sad. We should want to work towards being united, not divided.\u201d\n\nPolitics aside, it\u2019s been an extremely busy year for Alison.\n\nToday she\u2019s nipped back home to North London, where she lives with partner Michael Elwyn, for just one night before returning to Manchester to carry on filming for a new BBC series, Life, written by Doctor Foster writer Mike Bartlett.\n\nAnd she recently finished filming for the Gavin & Stacey Christmas special, where she will revive the role of Pam Shipman to the delight of fans.\n\n\u201cPam is so special to me,\u201d she says, beaming.\n\n\u201cFrom when I read the first script I just thought \u2018This is really good\u2019.\n\n\u201cI always know straight away if it\u2019s something I want to do.\n\n\u201cI can hear it in my head when I read it. And I could hear Pam straight away. But we were all 100% convinced it would never happen. I always used to say leave well alone. But then, suddenly, I got this message from Ruth Jones.\n\n\u201cIt said \u2018Would you consider doing a Christmas special?\u2019 I was like \u2018What!\u2019 I just couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cWe were all a bit hysterical, hugging, kissing, laughing, crying.\n\n\u201cWe had two or three days round the table having Christmas dinner .\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of banter going on, a lot of gags, particularly from Rob Brydon. I hope people do like it. The thing about it, and what I\u2019ve always felt about Gavin & Stacey, is that there\u2019s warmth there.\n\n\u201cThey might row, they might get upset, but you know underneath it all they love each other.\u201d\n\nAs for her own life, the star says she won\u2019t be giving up acting any time soon although she admits she has had to slow down in recent years.\n\n\u201cI still have to travel a lot for work but I am still healthy \u2013 touch wood,\u201d she laughs as she knocks on the table.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old actors\u2019 thing, you\u2019re either in the money or out of it.\n\n\u201cAnd oh, how I love it. I\u2019d never want to give up, however long I\u2019ve got left.\n\n\u201cThough I do get tired now, learning lines is a chore.\n\n\u201cI used to be able to do it in an hour but now I need a break.\n\n\u201cBut I still feel very lucky and privileged to be doing what I am doing.\u201d\n\n(Image: David Dyson)\n\nOnly Labour can restore national treasure's health\n\nBy Ken Loach, Bafta Award-winning film director\n\nIt\u2019s a hugely important film because it explains why the NHS is on its knees.\n\nThe danger is not only insufficient funding but we need to remove all the private contractors, which are in effect privatising it.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to get back to the original principles, because it\u2019s the most efficient.\n\nThere\u2019s a moral question too \u2013 why should big corporations make money out of our healthcare and looking after our children? Does Richard Branson need another island in the West Indies?\n\nNo, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nWe need proper funding and proper public ownership of it again, where everyone has a direct contract from the health service, from caterers to cleaners to consultants.\n\nWe do not want a system like America. We know it\u2019s massively unequal. It\u2019s massively inefficient and gives massive profits to a few people.\n\nThat\u2019s the opposite of what Nye Bevan\u2019s dream was and we\u2019ve got to make that dream a reality again.\n\nThe election coming up is critical. People have got to get out and vote Labour \u2013 that way, we can restore the National Health Service.\n\nIf we don\u2019t win, we shall lose it.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Gavin and Stacey actress Alison Steadman says we are losing our NHS as she spoke out about her heartbreak at watching her mum die in an underfunded, understaffed NHS hospital", "authors": ["Rhian Lubin", "Image", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror", "David Dyson"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20555329.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Actress-Alison-Steadman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
