Rand Paul said Thursday the problem with Rep. Liz Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, is that \u201cthey\u2019ve always been never-Trumpers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey hate President Trump\u2019s foreign policy, they want to stay in Afghanistan forever, they\u2019re apologizing for [former national security adviser] John Bolton \u2014 they love John Bolton,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said on CNN. \u201cSo really, they are part of this foreign policy swamp that\u2019s been trying to undermine President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe sniping between the two sides began Wednesday when Mr. Paul tweeted an article critical of Ms. Cheney for opposing Mr. Trump on the war in Afghanistan.\n\nMs. Cheney, Wyoming Republican and member of House GOP leadership, fired back by reiterating her support for the president and the military and rapping Mr. Paul for making the comments on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nThe feud carried into Thursday as Mr. Paul defended the president\u2019s firing of Mr. Bolton and took aim at Ms. Cheney for her \u201c\u2018Never Trump\u2018 warmongering\u201d and \u201cpro-Bolton blather.\u201d\n\nMs. Cheney then retweeted an old post in which Mr. Trump called Mr. Paul a \u201cspoiled brat\u201d and saying \u201cNo truer words were ever spoken.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the 2016 race was painful for you since you were such a big loser (then & now) with a dismal 4.5 % in Iowa,\u201d she said. \u201cNo surprise since your motto seems to be \u2018Terrorists First, America Second.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
