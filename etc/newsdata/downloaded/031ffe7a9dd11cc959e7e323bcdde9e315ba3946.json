But Chris Noth\u2014A.K.A. Mr. Big\u2014is still right at home in Manhattan. In fact, he insists on it.\n\nLike a scene cut from a Sex and the City movie, Noth meets me inside the Cutting Room, the music club he owns in midtown Manhattan, for drinks. In an over-the-top move worthy of Mr. Big, he opened it just for us. But suffice it to say, we do not drink Cosmos. In fact, he makes it immediately clear that Mr. Big and Chris Noth are not one and the same. \u201cI do not drink Cosmos,\u201d he tells me emphatically. \u201cI maybe had one in my life.\u201d\n\nToday, he\u2019s having a glass of Ambhar A\u00f1ejo Tequila, with a single ice cube. He readily admits that, up until recently, \u201cTo me, tequila was just kind of synonymous with Margaritas. You didn\u2019t taste the tequila like a brandy or a good whiskey.\u201d\n\nNow part owner of Ambhar, after meeting the founder and CEO Jaime Celorio through a mutual acquaintance, he\u2019s developed an interest in the spirit. While he\u2019s careful to avoid comparing himself to George Clooney, who also famously backs a tequila, Noth and his well-known face are no doubt a great asset to the five-year-old Ambhar, which is currently available in a number of states, including Texas, Florida, New Jersey and Colorado. (It\u2019s also served in the Mexico Pavilion at Epcot and at all the bars in the stadium where the Dallas Cowboys play, in Arlington, Texas.)\n\n\u201cThis was a new experience for me,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis to me is as rich and distinctive as any whiskey or bourbon or Scotch that is bragged about in the industry, but it\u2019s tequila. When I\u2019m in L.A., if I\u2019m at home in the back to have a drink with friends and have a cigar, the spirit I\u2019m drinking has to count. I\u2019m not just downing it. It\u2019s got to have enough weight to it and essence to it that I can take the time to sip it all night fucking long if I want. And if I get loaded, it\u2019s going to take a long time. And that\u2019s going to be a good loaded.\u201d\n\nI associate Noth\u2014and Mr. Big\u2014with oversize Manhattans and impressive glasses of whiskey, and he assures me I\u2019m not far off. \u201cI do enjoy whiskey. I enjoy an Old-Fashioned. I like a Manhattan, but I don\u2019t like Maker\u2019s Mark. I don\u2019t like any of the sweet stuff,\u201d he tells me and then goes on to chart the evolution of his drinking. \u201cI was just doing vodka for a long time. Now, I\u2019m starting to lose my taste for [it].\u201d\n\nI suspect that part of the reason for this is that his drinks were often not made to his liking. \u201cI like a Martini, but easy on all the vermouth,\u201d he says. \u201cJust a whiff. It has to be really shaken cold.\u201d And don\u2019t get him started on small cocktail glasses or short pours. \u201cA good bartender will fill it right to the rim. You know what I mean? With a twist. Sometimes when you don\u2019t have a good bartender it\u2019s very frustrating. It\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, what are you doing?\u2019 It\u2019s worse in Canada where they measure it out. So I have to go, \u2018Give me a triple.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoth, who has played a series of intensely powerful characters, a detective on Law & Order, and then, of course, a business executive on Sex and the City and most recently, a disgraced politician on The Good Wife, is much more relaxed in real life\u2014almost playful. His eyes light up as he regales me with stories old New York and some of its most colorful residents, including Jerry Orbach his former partner on Law & Order and his close friend and mentor. \u201cJerry was a great drinker,\u201d he told me recalling that he kept a bottle of vodka in his dressing room. \u201cHe could hold his liquor. I never saw Jerry drunk. Ever.\u201d\n\nMoving on from Orbach, Noth seamlessly segues into stories about Elaine Kaufman and her eponymous Upper East Side restaurant. \u201cI was at Elaine\u2019s a lot, which was great cause there was always something happening at Elaine\u2019s,\u201d he tells me while channeling the late restaurateur.\n\n\u201cAt first, she was not very impressed with me because I used to just go to try to drink,\u201d he admits. (Kaufman, according to him, hated folks who didn\u2019t eat, too.) Not only didn\u2019t he have a lot of money early on, but \u201cthe food was fucking terrible. Terrible.\u201d However, the drinks were great and Noth still keeps in touch with a few of Kaufman\u2019s bartenders.\n\nWhile he never enjoyed eating at her restaurant, he couldn\u2019t stay away. \u201cIt was exciting,\u201d he says. \u201cYou never knew what you were going to find when you went there: Whether it was a politician or a model or an actor or an actress or a fighter. A lot of detectives hung out there.\u201d\n\nAnd Kaufman grew to be his fan. \u201cShe loved me after Sex and the City,\u201d he said. And \u201cI loved her.\u201d\n\nDespite the benefits that came with Mr. Big, Noth would love nothing more to shed the role. Carrying his lifeless corpse around for the last 15 years, since the series ended has taken its toll. \u201cI can\u2019t escape that fucking show,\u201d he says with a hearty laugh.\n\nBut as we talk about his break-out role, he admits that he actually hates how the show changed his beloved New York. He first came here as a teenager from Madison, Wisconsin, when his mother got a job as a CBS news correspondent in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cThe show articulated a certain idea of the city, which then people who came to the city wanted instead of the city,\u201d Noth tells me. \u201cAnd it turned into that. Magnolia fucking Bakery and all that crap.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, people are so sick of me grumbling about what\u2019s happened to Manhattan, but it\u2019s just true,\u201d he continues. \u201cManhattan was a broth of different varieties of neighborhoods that all had their own essential flavor and politics. You practically needed a passport to get into certain sections. And it is now one thing.\u201d\n\nWhile I don\u2019t disagree with him about how Manhattan has changed and how the show may have played a role, I do point out that without Sex and the City there might not have been the rebirth of the cocktail. The show helped make Martinis, Manhattans and, yes, Cosmos sexy and cool and in the process brought legitimacy and prestige to the bartending profession. \u201cI always had a lot of scenes where I had a drink in my hand,\u201d he says, nodding in agreement.\n\nWith that, we finish our glasses of tequila, and Noth heads out into the city he loves.", "description": "We caught up with actor Chris Noth to talk about his new tequila brand and life in New York after \u201cSex and the City.\u201d", "authors": ["Noah Rothbaum", "Half Full Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570848803/191011-Rothbaum-Chris-Noth-tease_bbjsvz", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
