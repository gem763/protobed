Can\u2019t they just fade away and enjoy their large pot of money?\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Megyn Kelly, Gretchen Carlson, Greta Van Susteren Demand Comcast Launch New NBC News Investigation\n\nKelly, who was expected to be paid out for the remainder of her three-year contract when she left NBC, responded to Dowd Saturday in her own tweet, writing, \u201cYes, I could just sit back and \u2018enjoy my money,\u2019 @matthewjdowd, but instead I\u2019ve chosen to speak up for women being harassed and abused who have been muzzled by NDAs. Sorry you find that so annoying.\u201d\n\n(At the time Kelly left NBC, an individual familiar with the matter told TheWrap that her the sum she was paid was believed to be between $25 million and $30 million.)\n\nDowd kept the conversation going, questioning if she stood up for women who accused prominent Republicans of sexual misconduct, like \u201cChristine Blasey Ford, Anita Hill, and all the accusers of President Trump?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, I know you are blasting NBC, but I don\u2019t see you saying much about Fox,\u201d he continued.\n\nKelly pointed out that the forthcoming movie \u201cBombshell\u201d portrays her standing up for women at Fox News and she \u201cput Trump accusers on the air.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Megyn Kelly Says NBC News Needs an 'Outside Investigation' After Ronan Farrow Book (Video)\n\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI devoted an entire chapter of my book to the harassment scandal at Fox and discussed it on virtually every network. It was a NYT #1 Best Seller. You should read it! #settleformore\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, Kelly gave her first on-air interview since leaving NBC last year to Fox News, where she called for an outside investigation into NBC\u2019s handling of sexual assault allegations made against Lauer, to determine what executives were aware of beforehand.\n\nDowd deleted his original tweet and Kelly told him, \u201cI am all for less meanness in the world. We\u2019re good @matthewjdowd.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly\u2019s reps haven\u2019t responded to TheWrap\u2019s questions about her future career plans. Meanwhile, you can catch Charlize Theron playing Kelly in \u201cBombshell,\u201d which opens in theaters on Dec. 20.\n\n.\n\nRead original story Megyn Kelly on Her Public Resurfacing: \u2018I\u2019ve Chosen to Speak Up for Women Being Harassed and Abused\u2019 At TheWrap", "description": "Megyn Kelly\u2019s name has popped up in the media more in the past week than in the entire past year because workplace sexual harassment is back in the news, and it has prompted her to speak out and not \u2018just sit back and enjoy my money.'\u201dFriday, news broke that Kelly had been among the notable newswomen", "authors": ["Lindsey Ellefson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MtLKeNJ9pNXWy9UrR7MZmA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/62c1838a63ffe3bf02299aaa6da49cfc", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
