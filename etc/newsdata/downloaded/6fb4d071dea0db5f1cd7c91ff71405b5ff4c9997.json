That means researching individual bonds can be challenging.\n\nRead more: Want Good, Safe Yields? Check Out Municipal Bonds.\n\nMiller and his co-manager, Tim Ryan, both have more than 25 years\u2019 experience doing just that. (Ryan also has worked structuring bond deals for municipalities to raise funds.) As the co-head of fixed income at Nuveen Asset Management, Miller oversees a 25-member muni-bond analyst team.\n\nThat deep bench has helped Strategic Municipal Opportunities beat 97% of its peers in Morningstar\u2019s Muni National Long category in the past three years. Since the fund\u2019s December 2014 inception through August of this year, it has delivered a 5.7% annualized return, versus just 3.7% for the S&P Municipal Bond Index. (The fund charges a 3% front-end load on its A shares.)\n\nWhile Nuveen manages several muni-bond funds, this is the shop\u2019s most flexible one and thus represents the two managers\u2019 best ideas. Miller and Ryan launched the fund based on requests from financial advisors who were tired of funds restricted to a specific credit quality or bond maturity and wanted more active management.\n\nOne unusual area this fund has profitably ventured into is distressed bonds, such as those of electric utility FirstEnergy \u2019s (FE) subsidiary FirstEnergy Solutions. The bonds are tax-free municipals because they finance emission scrubbers and waste disposal at the company\u2019s nuclear- and coal-power plants\u2014and the state of Ohio wants to protect citizens from toxic emissions.\n\nFirstEnergy\u2019s subsidiary suffered from competition with gas-powered utilities and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2018, around when Miller bought its bonds for 31 cents on the dollar of their face value.\n\nNuveen Strategic Municipal Opportunities Note: Holdings as of 7/31. Returns through 9/9; three-year returns are annualized. Sources: Morningstar; Nuveen\n\n\u201cThese [power plant] assets are being dramatically undervalued,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThe power markets need a diversified strategy as opposed to trying to convert to 100% natural gas.\u201d He proved correct. Ohio is offering the company zero-emission credits to bail out its nuclear plants, while the parent company is helping stabilize the subsidiary by taking on its employees\u2019 pension obligations, Miller adds. The bonds have almost tripled in value to 88 cents on the dollar of their face value.\n\nThe fund has benefited recently from a number of such \u201cpollution control\u201d or \u201cindustrial-development revenue\u201d bonds of formerly distressed companies. Among its development plays: Zilkha Biomass Selma, an Alabama-based pellet manufacturer; Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay, a resort and conference center owned by the state of Maryland; and Delta Air Lines \u2019 (DAL) bonds to finance its terminal\u2019s construction at LaGuardia Airport in New York.\n\nBut the strength of Nuveen\u2019s flexible strategy is that it can also play defense. Historically, the fund\u2019s allocation to junk-rated muni bonds has ranged from 26% to 47%. As of the end of July, it was on the low end of the spectrum at 30%. \u201cThe high-yield market is so supply constrained,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cAllotments can be light, and you take what you can get.\u201d\n\nMiller and Ryan are also finding more opportunities in investment-grade bonds from California and New York, which account for 30% of the portfolio. Since the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, residents of high-tax states are subject to a new, $10,000 cap on state- and local-tax, or SALT, deductions. That has made wealthy New Yorkers and Californians hungrier for tax-free income. Simultaneously, the new law raised the income level at which people are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT\u2014a parallel federal income tax for the wealthy\u2014reducing the number of people subject to it.\n\nMunicipalities typically sell AMT-exposed bonds at higher yields to attract more investors. Now that fewer people will have to pay the AMT, such bonds are more attractive. One example is San Francisco International Airport bonds, the fund\u2019s largest holding as of the end of July. The AMT ones yield 0.32 percentage point more than non-AMT ones.\n\nOne mechanism that Miller and Ryan employ to control risks is interest-rate hedging. The fund can short, or bet against, Treasury bonds that will fall in value when interest rates go up. (As rates rise, already-issued Treasuries look worse in comparison with new ones issued at the higher rates, so the existing ones fall in value.) The fund did this throughout much of 2018 as rates were rising, then removed the hedge near year-end when markets became more volatile and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate increases seemed done.\n\n\u201cOur hedge is not on autopilot,\u201d Miller says. Indeed, having the flexibility to make those kinds of exposure adjustments, and getting them right, are this fund\u2019s key strengths.\n\nEmail: editors@barrons.com", "description": "The Nuveen Strategic Municipal Opportunities fund has found good opportunities in high-yield municipal debt and industrial development revenue bonds, putting it ahead of most of its peers over the past three years.", "authors": ["Lewis Braham"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-105248/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
