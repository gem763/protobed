We will know a lot more on Tuesday and he did have a scan as a precaution.'\n\nNo one else in England's back-row offers Vunipola's ball-carrying physicality.\n\nHatley, however, is confident that England will not be short of fire power in the absence of the giant No 8.\n\n'We plan for all eventualities and we have got with Ellis Genge, Mako Vunipola, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes and Kyle Sinckler,' said Hatley\n\nNeal Hatley reveals England will have a clearer picture over Vunipola's injury on Tuesday\n\n'People pick up the slack when Mako and Billy don't play. We have played a lot of rugby without them. Billy is an important figure for us, but other people pick up the slack.'\n\nThere were more positive injury updates on prop Joe Marler, who hobbled off during the victory in Tokyo.\n\n'Joe has trained this morning and he has played a lot of rugby for us,' said Hatley. 'It's a position we have good strength in - and we will see how he pulls up to make sure we put out the strongest team possible. There is a little bit of referral in his back and we will see how he is tomorrow.'", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: Billy Vunipola twisted his ankle during Saturday's World Cup victory over Argentina and was subsequently removed at half-time.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/07/19382446-0-image-a-23_1570428776826.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
