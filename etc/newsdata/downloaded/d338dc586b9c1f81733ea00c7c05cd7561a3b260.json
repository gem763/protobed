Last week, two low-caste children caught defecating outside were lynched.\n\nThe programme was launched in 2014 and sparked a flurry of toilet-building \u2013 more than 100m in five years. Politicians and Bollywood stars have participated in huge government publicity campaigns to promote the scheme, and children in rural schools have marched around villages singing about the public health benefits of eliminating open defecation. Numerous government and independent studies show that open defecation has dramatically declined.\n\nBut the programme has been dogged by criticism of overzealous government workers, volunteers and vigilantes using coercive tactics to help the government\u2019s effort.\n\nAn Indian news channel reported that the children \u2013 a 12-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy \u2013 killed last week in Madhya Pradesh lived in a small hut without a toilet in a village that was declared open-defecation free in April last year.\n\nThe boy\u2019s father, Manoj Valmiki, told Al Jazeera the children were killed after an altercation, during which caste-based slurs were used towards the family.\n\nThe toilet-building has led to huge advances in sanitation. An independent study of four states by the Institute of Labour Economics found that, between the programme\u2019s launch and the end of 2018, the number of people who admitted to defecating in the open declined from 70% to approximately 40-50%.\n\nA researcher who worked on the study said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d that toilet usage had increased dramatically since the report was released, since local government officials have spent much of the past few months organising India\u2019s elections, which took place in May.\n\nThe report was disputed by India\u2019s government, who said that rural toilet usage was 93.4%. Academics and opposition parties have accused the government of \u201cfudging data\u201d to meet the government\u2019s ambitious targets.\n\nMore than half of interviewees for a recent field study said the programme had led to abuse. A report listed a number of alarming incidents. One video showed a woman screaming as she was dragged into a car by village \u201cmotivators\u201d. Another showed men holding their ears and doing sit-ups surrounded by police officers and government staff as a punishment for openly defecation. The study also listed local news reports documenting attacks against open defecators, and showed hoardings in one district that warned: \u201cIf you defecate in the open, you will soon get death.\u201d\n\nSangita Vyas, a research fellow at the Rice Institute, said: \u201cFor Swachh Bharat to have made huge progress, they would have needed to address caste hierarchies and beliefs in purity and pollution. We found that it seems to have exacerbated caste hierarchies. Sanitation is used as a method for elite groups to suppress marginalised communities.\u201d\n\nConcerns were also raised in a report last year by the UN special rapporteur for safe drinking water and sanitation, Leo Heller. \u201cAs an unintended consequence of the desire to obtain rewards, including the title of \u2018open-defecation free\u2019, some aggressive and abusive practices seem to have emerged,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDespite rapid economic strides in past decades, India has lagged behind other countries on sanitation. Academics have argued that the practice of open defecation has survived because cleaning toilets is considered low caste work in India.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation under fire over award for Narendra Modi Read more\n\nThe killings of the two children in Madhya Pradesh occurred hours after Modi received an award in New York from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the Clean India programme. News of the award was met with protests and has reinvigorated debates about the role western governments and philanthropic organisations have played in boosting Modi\u2019s profile.\n\nIt led one Gates Foundation employee, Sabah Hamid, who worked in the organisation\u2019s India office, to resign in protest. Speaking to the Guardian about her decision, Hamid said she was \u201cincredulous\u201d when she learned about the award. \u201cIt seemed contrary to everything the foundation works on and claims to believe in,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the award ceremony, a map of India projected on to a screen turned green, showing that the country was due to become open defecation free by 2 October. A video that played on stage flashed up a quote from India\u2019s founding father, Mohandas Gandhi, saying: \u201cSanitation is more important than political independence.\u201d\n\nThe Gates Foundation did not respond to requests for comment, but has previously said: \u201cBefore the Swachh Bharat mission, over 500 million people in India did not have access to safe sanitation, and now, the majority do. There is still a long way to go, but the impacts of access to sanitation in India are already being realised.\u201d\n\nAn email sent to India\u2019s foreign and home ministries went unanswered.", "description": "Prime minister\u2019s announcement of an end to open defecation in India overshadowed by claims of coercion and violence", "authors": ["Vidhi Doshi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73c69c9fef6527c98208df69ec8c1096c0f06469/0_116_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af6e762b972fc76369e14c72029293fb", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
