And reach and amplification was not represented in that speech,' Dorsey said, according to journalist Sarah Frier who was tweeting from the event.\n\nDorsey said that Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook algorithm sees promoted posts that people pay for reach a bigger audience, which is a 'major gap and flaw in the substance he as getting across.'\n\nIn the Georgetown speech Zuckerberg said the founding of Facebook was in response to the Iraq war adding, \u2018If more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently.\u2019\n\nIt was the first time Zuckerberg made that Iraq War claim. He previously said Facebook was started as a tool to compare students\u2019 attractiveness.\n\nDorsey clapped back saying, 'There's some amount of revisionist history in all his storytelling. It takes away from the authenticity and the genuineness of what we're trying to do.'\n\nIn the Georgetown speech Zuckerberg said the founding of Facebook was in response to the Iraq war adding, 'If more people had a voice to share their experiences, maybe things would have gone differently.'

It was born out of a company's intention. That was not consistent with what I personally believe and want our company to stand for,' he added.\n\nDorsey co-founded Twitter in 2006 but has been heavily criticized for allowing extremist groups and hate speech to surface on the platform.\n\nBoth Twitter and Facebook face the challenge of sorting through hate speech, controversial content, and police misinformation.\n\nBoth have come under fire for running the same advertisement for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign which sparked outrage over disseminating false information.\n\nSome, including Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Kamala Harris, have argued that Twitter should censor Donald Trump's inflammatory tweets or suspend his account, but the website has maintained a hands-off approach on that front.", "description": "Twitter founder Jack Dorsey dug into Mark Zuckerberg while speaking at the\u00a0Twitter News Summit in New York City on Thursday.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/04/20164464-0-image-a-24_1571975582320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
