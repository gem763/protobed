You may be required to pony up your own money", "language": "en", "text": "Many retirees serve on nonprofit boards. If you ask a roomful of them to rate their experience, some would rave about the joy of giving back. Others would call it a disaster.\n\nJoining the board of directors of a nonprofit organization is a hit-or-miss proposition. But if you do your due diligence and follow a few simple rules at the outset, you\u2019re more likely to come away satisfied.\n\n\u201cThe nonprofit community always needs more board members,\u201d said Cynthia Remec, executive director of New York City-based BoardAssist. \u201cBut if folks don\u2019t approach the matching process thoughtfully, they won\u2019t be happy with the board they join, which is a shame as there are more than enough boards that are great fits for most people.\u201d\n\nAvoid rushing your decision to join. Take it slowly and schedule multiple discussions with board members and senior staff.\n\n\u201cTreat it like a job interview,\u201d said Andy Davis, director of education at BoardSource in Washington, D.C. \u201cClarify expectations and make sure you understand your obligations before you join.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s better than agreeing to fill a board seat after an acquaintance approaches you. Perhaps the nonprofit seeks to tap your professional expertise\u2014as an accountant, lawyer or marketing executive\u2014and you figure you might as well share your knowledge.\n\nHit the pause button before you commit and ask questions such as:\n\n\u2022 Am I passionate about the organization\u2019s mission?\n\n\u2022 Do I like the people (both board members and staff)?\n\n\u2022 Who else is on the board?\n\n\u2022 What am I expected to give (including straight-up cash, in-kind donations and buying tickets to pricey fundraisers)?\n\n\u2022 To what extent am I expected to enlist others to give?\n\n\u201cYou want to have the \u2018give-get\u2019 in writing\u2014the amount you give and the amount you get from others each year,\u201d Remec said. \u201cFind out if the two numbers are interchangeable.\u201d If the give-get is $5,000, for example, ask if you must personally donate a certain amount even if you raise $5,000 from others.\n\nRemec adds that while many retirees who join boards are willing to give a certain amount each year to the nonprofit, they may feel uncomfortable soliciting their friends to donate. Others say, \u201cIf I\u2019m on the board, I\u2019ll make a donation but I want my primary gift to be my intellectual capital.\u201d\n\nOf course, your stint on the board should consist of more than giving money and getting money from others. It\u2019s more rewarding when you can have a positive impact by, say, helping raise the organization\u2019s profile or improving its operation.\n\nRemec suggests asking for three examples of what board members have accomplished over the last year that didn\u2019t involve raising capital. Perhaps the board helped redesign the nonprofit\u2019s website, developed new bylaws or crafted a strategic plan. This gives you an idea of the board\u2019s impact beyond money.\n\nWhen meeting other board members and the organization\u2019s executive director, are you inspired and impressed? You\u2019ll be working closely with these individuals, so you want to feel a mix of admiration and camaraderie.\n\nYou also want to gauge whether you\u2019ll make a difference. Remec warns that \u201cthe biggest reason a board match fails\u201d is a newcomer feels devalued.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing is to go on the board and then find that no one listens to you or cares what you say,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hear people say, \u2018They just wanted my money or for me to get money from other people.\u2019\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t forget the small stuff. Clarify up front where and when the board meets. If the time or location of these gatherings poses an inconvenience to you, ask if you can call in.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t come to all the board meetings and you need to phone in, ask how many other board members do that,\u201d Remec said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the only one who phones in.\u201d\n\nFinally, investigate the organization\u2019s finances, recent history and key metrics such as employee turnover. If you\u2019re joining a board of a nonprofit that just completed a merger or other major transition, gird for some conflict. Disruptive change rarely unfolds in a seamless, stress-free manner.\n\n\u201cLook at the organization\u2019s Form 990 for the last couple of years,\u201d said Rick Cohen, chief communications officer at the National Council of Nonprofits in Washington, D.C. \u201cWhat direction is it going in terms of year-end asset balance? Did it lose money?\u201d\n\nYou can usually find Form 990 online\u2014it\u2019s a public document filed with the IRS\u2014or ask the nonprofit for a copy. While you\u2019re at it, confirm that the organization carries Directors & Officers (D&O) insurance. In some cases, board members can be held personally liable for the actions of the nonprofit.", "description": "Read the fine print: It should be more than giving and getting money.", "authors": ["Morey Stettner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GR800_board__ZG_20181015152606.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
