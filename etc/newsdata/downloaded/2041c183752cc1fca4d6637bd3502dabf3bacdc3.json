Wednesday: If MPs vote for an election this would be the day when Parliament is dissolved. Thursday: The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 dictates that election campaigns must last at least 25 working days. Thursday would be when that clock would start ticking. Thursday December 5: Elections in the UK are usually held on a Thursday and this is potentially the earliest the nation could go to the polls. Tuesday December 10 has also been mooted as a potential date for the election should the Thursday tradition be ditched.\n\nHow would an election be called?\n\nThe PM would ask the House of Commons to vote on the FTPA motion. It would require the support of two thirds of MPs in order to succeed.\n\nMr Johnson has gone down this path twice before but he was thwarted on both occasions by opposition MPs.\n\nIf he was able to get the support of two thirds of the Commons the nation would then be on track for a snap poll at some point in the first half of December.\n\nHowever, success or failure on the FTPA motion vote will almost certainly depend on what Labour decides to do.\n\nWill Labour back holding an early election?\n\nWhen Jeremy Corbyn blocked the PM's last two tries to force an election he said that he would agree to go to the country early as soon as a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out.\n\nIf the EU offers a delay to January 31 next year then that threat of a chaotic split from the bloc will have evaporated and in theory Mr Corbyn should back an election.\n\nHowever, he is under growing pressure from senior figures within Labour to block an election and instead push for a second referendum.\n\nThere are major fears among Labour MPs that the party would be decimated at a snap poll because of its policy of staying neutral on Brexit.\n\nBut Mr Corbyn is believed to be winning the battle and his spokesman as well as a number of his allies made clear yesterday and today that he will back an election once No Deal is ruled out.\n\nIf Jeremy Corbyn formally backs an election does that guarantee one will happen?\n\nNo and for a very simple reason. Even if Mr Corbyn says he wants his MPs to vote for a snap poll there is no guarantee that they will obey him.\n\nIn fact, recent reports suggest that a majority of Labour MPs intend to vote against a FTPA election motion - such is their level of concern about going to the country before Brexit has been resolved.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, pictured in the Commons yesterday, has previously said he will support an early election once a No Deal Brexit has been ruled out\n\nIf a major Labour rebellion did happen it could be difficult, but potentially not impossible, for Mr Johnson to hit the two thirds support threshold he would need.\n\nWhat happens if most Labour MPs do vote for an election?\n\nThere will almost certainly be a snap poll held before Christmas. Such an election is likely to be a nightmare to plan and the later in December it is held the more difficult it will be to stage.\n\nThe government has been warned that anything past the middle of December would not be feasible because church and village halls will be booked up for nativity plays and parties and will not be available to act as polling stations.\n\nWhat happens if most Labour MPs do not vote for an election?\n\nThere probably will not be a pre-Christmas election. In this scenario the UK would be stuck in Brexit purgatory.\n\nMr Johnson would likely have no choice but to bring back his Brexit deal to the Commons to try to get it agreed.\n\nBut his 'do or die' pledge would be in tatters and there would be no guarantees that Parliament would eventually agree to his divorce accord.\n\nIs there any chance the UK will leave the EU on October 31?\n\nThere is now not enough time before Halloween for the PM to get his deal through Parliament.\n\nBut Mr Tusk has made clear that the EU will not allow a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThat means the October 31 deadline is effectively dead in the water and Brexit will be delayed.", "description": "Britain's fate is in the hands of the European Union as Boris Johnson waits for the bloc to decide how long to delay Brexit.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20127492-0-image-a-39_1571914294289.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
