Whatever the motivation, the uncertainty that a possible no deal has caused, has already cost jobs. Acting to protect Britain from a no-deal Brexit isn\u2019t something to be done when it\u2019s convenient for MPs\u2019 careers, it\u2019s something to be done right now, as a matter of urgency.\n\nThere is, ultimately, a second step these MPs also need to take. Many want to take no deal off the table and may finally act today. I applaud this new willingness to act. But if it\u2019s part of a parliamentary game of trying to force hard Brexiteers towards the current prime minister\u2019s deal it means they are still not listening to other MPs or the electorate after a year of this failing strategy.\n\nAlongside the absence of a mandate for no deal, these MPs must surely also accept that there is now no parliamentary or democratic mandate for a soft Brexit either. If there were, both the Labour and Conservative parties would have done much better in the recent European elections.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s deal has been voted down emphatically by MPs three times. The head-in-the-sand strategy of the current cabinet and many departing ministers, of simply ignoring that position, must also now come to an end.\n\nPeople want MPs to get on with our jobs. They want this parliament to tackle the wider challenges Britain faces, from lack of opportunity and weak social mobility to housing, social care and the environment.\n\nThe country and parliament cannot move forward until we break the Brexit gridlock. The soft Brexit \u201cwets\u201d have had a year to get their version of Brexit through parliament already. I respect that they made their attempt, but for the sake of Britain, they must recognise that they\u2019ve failed.\n\nIn reality, as was clear this time last year, breaking through the gridlock means that only two courses of action remain possible.\n\nWe could allow our democracy a direct choice through a fresh referendum on no deal or no Brexit, possibly alongside the existing deal Theresa May struck with the EU. Failing that, a popular vote to break the Brexit gridlock could take the form of a general election.\n\nI still believe a referendum is the better course of action to break the Brexit logjam. But, if even that becomes impossible then de facto, we will see parliament finally fail and we will have a general election.\n\nI\u2019m fed up of Britain going nowhere. So are the British people. MPs unable to decide in parliament, yet also blocking the people from doing so, can\u2019t stop Britain moving forward any more. Just allow the people to take a decision on where our country goes next, with a Final Say referendum. Otherwise, accept the increasingly inevitable alternative of a general election.\n\nJustine Greening is Conservative MP for Putney, Roehampton & Southfields.", "description": "A no-deal departure from the EU is a threat to the union of our United Kingdom, our economy and our parliamentary democracy.
