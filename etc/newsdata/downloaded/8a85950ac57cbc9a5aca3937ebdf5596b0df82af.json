Jurors found her guilty only of one charge \u2014 gross abuse of a corpse \u2014 after Richardson admitted to burying the body in the backyard of her family\u2019s Ohio home in July 2017, when she was 18.\n\nOn Friday she was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation on the lone conviction, with credit for seven days she already has spent in custody. Under guidelines set by Judge Donald Oda II, who said Richardson\u2019s choices showed \u201ca grotesque disregard for life,\u201d she could spend up to a year in jail if she violates that probation.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution had a real hurdle that they were never really going to get over, which was the real inability of any of their folks to state with certainty that Skylar\u2019s baby was ever alive after birth,\u201d Bill Gallagher, an Ohio criminal justice attorney who was not involved with the case, tells PEOPLE.\n\nRELATED: Ohio Cheerleader Sentenced to Probation After Judge Says She Showed \u2018Grotesque Disregard for Life\u2019\n\n\u201cIn this case, what they were relying on were statements that she made during police questioning that either implied, indicated or sometimes inferred the child was alive,\u201d he says.\n\nView photos Brooke Skylar Richardson | WLWT5 More\n\nRELATED: Everything to Know About Trial for Cheerleader Accused of Murdering Her Newborn and Burying Body\n\n\u201cThe defense and their experts did a wonderful job of undermining any of the credibility of any of those statements,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were able to convincingly present that Skylar was vulnerable to manipulative police questioning, and as a result, really cast doubt on whether anything that she told police was, in fact, true.\u201d\n\nView photos Brooke Skylar Richardson, at left, with her attorney | Greg Lynch/The Journal-News via AP More\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
