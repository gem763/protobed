She believed it was a cry for help and called an ambulance.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they attended his behaviour flipped completely to normal and he refused to go to the hospital.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend she had a number of texts and conversations with Jonathon about his mental health, but he still didn\u2019t seek assistance.\n\n\u201cOn August 20 he was supposed to attend a course with West Midlands Ambulance Service. He didn\u2019t attend and his line manager was concerned so went to his flat.\n\n\u201cHe managed to get in but couldn\u2019t open the bathroom door, he thought it was secured with something behind it.\"\n\nAfter kicking in the door and finding Mr Harvey's body, the manager checked for signs of life, but the paramedic was dead.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nMr Harvey, a former on-call firefighter, had researched suicide methods online and left a suicide note, the inquest heard.\n\nDS Price said: \u201cIn terms of reasons we indicate the recent relationship breakdown. He had an affair and it came to light with his ex-partner who he had a child with. She didn\u2019t want to be in relationship after the affair.\u201d\n\nThe cause of death was given as hanging.\n\nA blood-alcohol test showed a reading of 63, which means he was just under the drink-drive limit of 80. There was also a small amount of codeine in his system.\n\nSouth Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh concluded Jon killed himself.\n\nMr Haigh said: \u201cHe had no recorded psychiatric history, although it was clear he had mental health issues prior to his death but wouldn\u2019t seek assistance.\n\n\u201cOn August 20 he did not attend a training course. His colleagues were concerned and went to his flat. Once they got in there they find Mr Harvey dead with ligature to his neck.\n\n\u201cToxicology results show a modest amount of alcohol and some codeine, but not significant.\n\n\u201cPolice attended and investigated. There was no suggestion of third party involvement and a note that can be described as a suicide note was found as well as him also searching how to commit suicide.\n\n\u201cBringing that all together, I\u2019m satisfied Mr Harvey intended to kill himself. The cause of death is hanging, and my formal finding is one of suicide while mentally unwell.\n\n\u201cI would still take this opportunity to convey my sympathy to his family for the sad circumstances of his death.\"\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
