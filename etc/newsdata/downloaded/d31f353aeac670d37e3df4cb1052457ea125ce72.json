As commendable as it is that the company wants to showcase new work on contemporary trends and problems, these pieces too frequently have as their chief virtue only an earnest desire to spotlight current or recent events. I\u2019m thinking of plays like \u201cRoe\u201d and \u201cKleptocracy\u201d and \u201cIntelligence,\u201d all of which felt right for Washington, except that none of them added much more emotional context than a glance at Wikipedia accomplishes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRight to Be Forgotten,\u201d seen at a preview performance last week, is another entry in this vein, a drama that adheres to a formula so well-traveled that you can see the wear in its treads: Start with a ripped-from-the-headlines dilemma and complicated main character; stir in conflicted romantic partner; add feisty legal crusader and corrupt opponent; wait 60 minutes; see sparks fly. For seasoning, sprinkle in such themes as the fragility of reputation and the indelible stain of an Internet scarlet letter.\n\nHere, the \u201cvictim\u201d is one Derril Lark (John Austin), a man in his mid-20s who a decade earlier stalked a fellow high school student (Guadalupe Campos) and ended up branded a predator on an anonymous blog. The posting went viral, and Derril\u2019s life has been a living hell ever since. As played by Austin, socially awkward Derril seems a nice enough young man, but the extent of his troubling adolescent acts remains murky; it\u2019s left to an audience member to decide whether the punishment \u2014 a vicious level of eternal hostility online that thwarts his career and haunts his relationships \u2014 fits the crime.\n\nIn Arena\u2019s Cradle, the procedural aspects of \u201cRight to Be Forgotten\u201d unfold, with the title framing the debate: Can a statute of limitations be imposed on Web condemnation? Does a reformed individual have recourse to see a bad act deleted from the cloud? This variation on a long-standing conundrum of the media age \u2014 \u201cWhich office do I go to to get my reputation back?\u201d a Reagan administration official accused of corruption once asked \u2014 surely has dramatic potential.\n\nBut for the stage, these inquiries require a few interesting zigs and zags. Otherwise, an audience catches on too quickly to the plot, and we start correctly guessing where the next step takes us. That\u2019s the unfortunate consequence in this play, and it proves pretty lethal to its public-service intentions.\n\nThe director leans into the wisecracky tone in the writing, which weakens the sense that people are actually conversing believably. It\u2019s hard to imagine a lawyer working on behalf of such a distraught client behaving in the cavalier way Melody Butiu\u2019s Marta does; the portrayal almost makes a joke of activist impulses. And some of the tactics ascribed to Marta, in her dealings with a seriously compromised legal opponent (Rachel Felstein) and Michigan\u2019s ethically derelict attorney general (Edward O\u2019Blenis) are out-and-out ludicrous. (Ivania Stack\u2019s costumes for the lawyers may be a bit glamorous, but at least they have appeal for the eye.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe play\u2019s most successful aspect has to do with Campos\u2019s Eve, whose life, too, has been upended in the aftermath of Derril\u2019s creepy and menacing behavior. Eve gets her chance to spell it out for Derril, who listens sympathetically and apologizes profusely. But it is Eve\u2019s pain, and the trusting pact with the world that was broken for her by Derril, that feels like the far more important matter. The laws indeed may want to find methods of granting digital mercy to the Derrils of the world. On this disappointing occasion, though, you may want to know more about what society has to offer the Eves.\n\nRight to Be Forgotten, by Sharyn Rothstein. Directed by Seema Sueko.
