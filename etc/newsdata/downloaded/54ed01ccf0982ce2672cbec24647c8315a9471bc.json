Although these infractions may not have occurred at Coach Pitino's direction or with his knowledge, the problems leading to the NCAA infractions happened under his leadership.\n\n\u201cWe thank Coach Pitino for his years of service to the University of Louisville basketball program and wish him well. Coach Pitino and the University of Louisville have mutually agreed to dismiss their legal claims against each other, designate his departure as a resignation, and move forward.\u201d\n\nPitino, 67, was fired from Louisville in the wake of a massive FBI investigation revealed his involvement in a pay-for-play scheme. Louisville has vacated its 2013 national championship, its 2012 Final Four appearance and 123 wins as a result of the scandal.\n\nPitino has long proclaimed his innocence, and was never actually indicted. He filed a lawsuit against the university shortly after his firing, arguing that Louisville didn\u2019t have just cause for his dismissal. Louisville also filed a countersuit against him.\n\nStory continues\n\nPitino, who also coached the New York Knicks and the Boston Celtics, spent one season as head coach of Panathinaikos in the EuroLeague in Greece \u2014 where he led them to a championship. He has long expressed his desire to return to coaching in the United States, and said that Wednesday\u2019s decision marks a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in his life.\n\n\"Against my lawyer\u2019s advice I\u2019m dropping my lawsuit with ULAA,\u201d Pitino said, via the Louisville Courier Journal. \u201cI am very proud of the many accomplishments my teams achieved at Louisville. I\u2019m so thankful and honored to coach such dedicated athletes.\n\n\"I\u2019m also disappointed in how it ended. But as head coach I am held responsible for the actions of all team members. I still have so much passion for the game and so many goals I want to achieve. From this day forward I start my climb.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Rick Pitino will not receive any money in the settlement with Louisville, though the university officially changed his dismissal from a \"firing\" to a \"resignation.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.fxQMPPrcrnGD.KZpA4EKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NjcuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1EbSWTgTxlcZIxCLpg48aA--~B/aD0zMTM2O3c9NDYzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b88efaa0-da8e-11e9-98bf-4692cbf0c7c8", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
