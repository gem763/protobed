You scrape out your baby\u2019s soiled nappy and put it back on because you can\u2019t afford to change it as often as needed. And when you have your period, you\u2019re housebound because you\u2019ve no money to buy sanitary products.\n\nThis is hygiene poverty.\n\nIn summer 2018, I watched Ken Loach\u2019s I, Daniel Blake \u2013 a harrowing depiction of UK lives ruined by the failing welfare system. I was struck in particular by a scene in which the character Katie is caught shoplifting, despite having already been to a food bank, with razors, deodorants and sanitary pads all stuffed into her bag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatching this propelled me to set up The Hygiene Bank. Through a network of partners, we are now helping thousands across the country who are at risk of isolating themselves.\n\nThe Hygiene Bank is a people-powered, grassroots charity, grounded in community. We collect and re-distribute donated toiletries, hygiene, beauty and personal care items via a network of charity partners that include the food bank, refuge, supported housing for 16-24 year olds, hostels and schools. These in turn are then given out to those that desperately need them.\n\nOne in five people in Britain are defined as \u2018living in poverty\u2019. Two-thirds of children in poverty live in a working family, where earnings and costs of living don\u2019t marry up.\n\nParents are increasingly prioritising feeding their families over buying hygiene products, while young teens and adults are going hungry to save themselves the humiliation of showing up at college with greasy hair and body odour. Teachers tell me they have seen an increase in the number of pupils coming to school looking unwashed and in dirty clothes.\n\nThey have seen families who wash their faces, bodies, hair and clothes in the same washing up liquid used for the dishes, and kids who don\u2019t own a toothbrush.\n\nImagine being housebound because you\u2019ve no money to buy sanitary products (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe first time I made a delivery to a food bank, a mum turned to her children and said, \u2018look, you can have a toothbrush each\u2019. They were delighted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne teen in supported housing told me, \u2018I was ashamed, feeling dirty made me feel worthless. I was too embarrassed for people to see me that way, and so I stayed away from college and my friends and my mental health got worse.\u2019\n\nI hear about this crippling impact on confidence, good health and mental wellbeing all the time.\n\nHygiene and personal care products aren\u2019t life-or-death, but they have a fundamental impact on the way we interact with each other, and play our part in society.\n\nMy passion and that of all our volunteers stems from a sense of injustice. Feeling clean should not be a luxury or a privilege in modern Britain.\n\nFrom universal credit, to employability tests and work sanctions; from cuts to hardship funds, to closures of children\u2019s centres, we live in a crazy world where the very structures designed to help people out of a hole are dragging them further down.\n\nWith the rise of the gig economy and the gradual decline of worker rights, the old adage that work is the route out of poverty is no longer true for many people.\n\nWe need to look at an approach to children and invest in them as our future. There needs to be a plan to boost living standards and support our towns and cities in building a more hopeful economic future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow is the time to demand concerted action to solve it. Government, businesses, employers and communities need to take action so that we don\u2019t find ourselves in 100 years\u2019 time still reporting that millions of people struggle to make ends meet.\n\nBut in the mean time, this is what you can do to help.
