The analysts expect 7% U.S. same-restaurant sales growth in the third-quarter.\n\n\u201cDifficult comparisons coupled with concerns about a slowing consumer spending environment could weigh on investor sentiment,\u201d analysts said.\n\nStifel rates Starbucks shares hold with a $90 price target.\n\nAlso: McDonald\u2019s expected to jump into the chicken sandwich war next year: KeyBanc\n\nStarbucks has an average overweight stock rating and $96.16 target price, according to 29 analysts polled by FactSet.\n\nHere\u2019s what to look for in Starbucks earnings:\n\nEarnings: FactSet is guiding for earnings per share of 70 cents, up from 62 cents last year.\n\nEstimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, expects per-share earnings of 73 cents.\n\nStarbucks has beat the FactSet EPS outlook the last five quarters.\n\nSales: FactSet expects sales of $6.68 billion, up from $6.30 billion last year.\n\nEstimize is guiding for sales of $6.70 billion.\n\nStarbucks has beat the FactSet consensus six of the last 7 quarters.\n\nStock price: Starbucks shares have fallen 15.7% over the past three months, but they have rallied 30% in 2019 and 44% for the past year.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SBUX, +0.26% is up 14.4% for the last 12 months.\n\nAlso: Chipotle\u2019s carne asada supply is running low, bringing the limited-time offer to an early end\n\nOther items:\n\n-Quo Vadis Capital says the stock price dip over the last three months is logical. \u201cDespite everything we like about Starbucks, this pullback probably makes sense given the reality of the company\u2019s growth rate,\u201d Quo Vadis wrote. \u201cFor the recently-ended quarter, Starbucks faces a more difficult comparison and we don\u2019t expect the kind of upside that occurred in June.\u201d\n\n-China is key to Starbucks\u2019 growth, but Luckin Coffee Inc. LK, -2.59% is a tough competitor. \u201cAccelerating Luckin app download and usage share highlights heightened competition in China, but Starbucks metrics improved some after mobile order and pay expansion this summer,\u201d wrote UBS analysts.\n\nUBS rates Starbucks stock neutral with a $95 price target.\n\n\u201cWe believe China uncertainty, in addition to valuation and tax rate guidance, are reasons for Starbucks stock\u2019s recent weakness,\u201d wrote KeyBanc. \u201cAnd rightfully so given geopolitical pressures and increased competition from local players in coffee (e.g. Luckin Coffee) and other high-end beverages.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Hasbro says tariffs are to blame for earnings miss\n\nStill, KeyBanc thinks there\u2019s room for more than one coffee company in the country, and analysts note that results for McDonald\u2019s Corp. MCD, -1.45% and Nike Inc. NKE, -0.08% suggest that Chinese consumers are still willing to spend with American companies.\n\n-The Starbucks mobile app is now the second biggest payment app in the U.S., according to eMarketer. The app was overtaken by Apple Pay, the first time a generic mobile app is more popular than the coffee chains.\n\nThe Starbucks app will have 25.2 million users this year while Apple Pay will have 27.7 million, eMarketer wrote in a report published Sunday.\n\n\u201cApple Pay has benefited from the spread of new point-of-sale systems that work with the NFC signals Apple Pay runs on,\u201d said Yory Wurmser, eMarketer\u2019s principal analyst.", "description": "Starbucks earnings should benefit from beverage innovation, including the Nitro drink, according to analysts.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU162_sbux_n_MG_20191028153021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
