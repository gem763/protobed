Here are some super-easy, sustainable costume ideas that you can whip up in no time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMummy\n\nStick the loo roll in the recycling at the end of the night (Picture: Getty)\n\nIt\u2019s a classic, lazy last-minute option \u2013 and there\u2019s no plastic in sight.\n\nStart from your ankles and wind yourself up in toilet paper from head-to-toe.\n\nIf you think you might be a bit nippy (even the 4-ply, quilted luxury stuff might not protect you from the elements) wear black leggings and a tight black top underneath.\n\nRemember to leave a few bits hanging off and maybe smear some dirt around your arms to give you that just-climbed-out-of-a-tomb authenticity.\n\nGhost\n\nJust make sure they\u2019re clean sheets (Picture: Getty)\n\nAnother simple classic, the ghost costume couldn\u2019t be easier.\n\nAll you need is a sheet and a pair of scissors. Cut some eye holes, dump the sheet over your head, and you\u2019re literally done.\n\nNo plastic here. And plenty of spook-appeal. Make sure you work on your creepy \u2018Oooooooo\u2019 to help you properly get into character.\n\nLibrarian\n\nGot some old books lying around? And a pair of glasses? Bingo \u2013 your librarian outfit is complete.\n\nYou can make your librarian look like they\u2019ve just been attacked by a werewolf by ripping up your clothes and smattering fake blood all over yourself.\n\nAnd don\u2019t say nothing scary happens in libraries \u2013 have none of you watched Buffy?\n\nPirate\n\nParrot optional (Picture: Getty)\n\nThis one may take a bit more of a rummage through your wardrobe or a local charity shop, but all you need is some baggy trousers or shorts, a white shirt, a big belt and an eye-patch (which you can make with cardboard and string).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the extra touches that really make a pirate, think about crafting your own accessories.\n\nA sword can be fashioned from old cereal boxes and silver paint. And keep your eye out for a stuffed parrot toy that you could tie to your shoulder.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget your giant gold hoops \u2013 you knew they would come in handy again one day.\n\nSkeleton\n\nAll you need for this one is white paint (bonus if you can find glow-in-the-dark paint).\n\nStart with an all-black outfit that you\u2019re happy to ruin. Try to use old clothes or charity shop clothes, rather than buying something new for cheap.\n\nLay it all out on the ground and paint bones in the shape of a skeleton along the front. The knee bone\u2019s connected to the shin bone\u2026 etc.\n\nBlack cat\n\nIt\u2019s basic\u2026 but we love it (Picture: Getty)\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a lot of eyeliner \u2013 you\u2019re basically sorted for this one.\n\nSimply dress all in black, then take your pencil or liquid eyeliner and draw on a black nose and whiskers.\n\nA tail can be half a pair of tights stuffed with cotton wool and fastened with a safety pin.\n\nMake ears out of black and pink card and staple them to a simple black headband. Purrrfect.\n\nMario and Luigi\n\nThe perfect Halloween double-act for your partner or your bestie to get involved with.\n\nAll you need to make this look work is a couple of pairs of dungarees, one bright red T shirt and one bright green T shirt, and your trusty eyeliner to draw on a pair of mustaches. Bonus points for matching blue caps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be adventure-seeking, Italian plumbers in no time.\n\nRegina George\n\nWe all love a Mean Girls costume. So any excuse \u2013 we\u2019re going to jump at it.\n\nWe have already written about the best Mean Girls Halloween costumes, but this is our favourite, sustainable option \u2013 and it\u2019s really simple.\n\nAll you need is a colourful bra and a white vest. Cut two holes just where your boobs are and boom \u2013 you\u2019re ready to set a new trend in your high school.\n\nIf people don\u2019t get the reference, that\u2019s on them.\n\nMORE: How to make a homemade face mask from your leftover pumpkin pulp\n\nMORE: Man invents blood pressure app and cures his own condition after doctors can\u2019t\n\nMORE: Quiz: Can you find all the shapes?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Halloween costumes contain a scary amount of plastic - but these easy ideas are plastic-free and sustainable.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/halloween_1571407974.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
