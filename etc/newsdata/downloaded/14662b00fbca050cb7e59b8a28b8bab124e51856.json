In fact, in the last two economic cycles, stocks were close to their cyclical peaks before they \u201ccracked under the weight of slower growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne asset class will ultimately be wrong, and history favours siding with the bond market,\u201d wrote Jason Daw, an analyst at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cConflicting signals from the curve, equities, and monetary policy, coupled with uncertainty surrounding the depth and longevity of the downturn, should not obscure the dangers of owning risky assets.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, +0.45% was up 0.53% on Friday above its all-time record close of 3,025.86 set on July 26, FactSet data show.\n\nMarket Pulse: S&P 500 on track for all-time closing high as stocks edge higher\n\nThe spread between the 3-month bill TMUBMUSD03M, +0.14% and the 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.15% , an indicator of the yield curve\u2019s slope, stood at a positive 10 basis points on Thursday, compared with negative 51 basis points on Sep. 3.\n\nAn inversion or a very narrow yield spread is widely seen as a prelude to an economic downturn, and is employed by the likes of the New York Federal Reserve in their recession models.\n\nDaw said if investors looked at other leading indicators of global economic growth such as purchasing manager surveys, freight orders, and exports, the state of the U.S. economy looked dim.\n\n\u201cOur economists believe that the U.S. expansion is on its last legs and that a recession should be apparent by mid-2020,\u201d he said.\n\nSome stock-market bulls have taken solace in the recent steepening of the yield curve, which still remains near very-flat levels. A wider spread between short-term and long-term rates can serve as a sign that investors anticipate growth and inflationary pressures that can weigh on long-term bond prices, pushing their yields higher.\n\nBut Daw warns that could give a false sense of comfort, as the yield curve had steepened sharply following an inversion at the end of the last two economic cycles in 2001 and 2008-09\u2019.\n\nSee: The yield curve is no longer inverted. But some still see an impending recession\n\nIn the chart below, Daw shows that the S&P 500 and the shape of the yield curve\u2019 slope diverged prior to the last two recessions. \u201cRapid steepening of the curve after inversion such as in the past couple of months is not a good sign,\u201d he said.", "description": "Stocks are near all-time highs despite a flat U.S. Treasury yield curve that only un-inverted a few weeks ago.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU027_boxing_ZG_20191025105112.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
