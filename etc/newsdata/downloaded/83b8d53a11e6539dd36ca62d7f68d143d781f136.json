They highlight severe management problems in public hospitals and lack of consequence for medical mistakes which leads to court cases and huge payouts that drain the health budget.\n\n\"This is further evidence of public sector incompetence that would doom the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) which is administratively very complex,\" Bloom said.\n\nDespite several attempts, Gauteng health department spokesperson Kwara Kekana could not be reached for comment on Wednesday morning.", "description": "A total of 3 832 patients have died in Gauteng public hospitals last year as a result of 10 741 serious adverse events, which largely arise from avoidable medical negligence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8949/57f8fc82130c43a9b162ff71fb57483c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
