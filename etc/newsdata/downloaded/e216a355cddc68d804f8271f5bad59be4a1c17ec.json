However, early demand for risky assets was putting a lid on prices.\n\nWe could see a volatile trade during the extended session because of whipsaw action in the stock and Treasury markets. Stocks broke sharply and yields fell after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she will make an announcement on possibly beginning impeaching proceedings on President Trump.\n\nHowever, stocks rebounded from their lows after Trump said he will release the full transcript of his phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, where he allegedly pressured him to investigate Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden\u2019s family.\n\nA spokesman for the former vice president said Biden will urge Trump to comply with congressional requests for information. The spokesman added that Biden thinks Congress has no choice but to impeach Trump if he does not comply. Trump has admitted to talking to Zelensky about Biden but denied pressuring him.\n\nGold could spike to the upside late in the session or early Wednesday if Pelosi decides to start impeachment proceeding against Trump. Gold could weaken if she decides not too or if stocks and Treasury yields rebound into the close.\n\nAt 18:46 GMT, December Comex gold futures are trading $1539.80, up $8.10 or +0.54%.\n\nDaily December Comex Gold More\n\nDaily Technical Analysis\n\nThe main trend is down according to the daily swing chart, however, momentum is trending lower. A trade through $1566.20 will change the main trend to up. A move through $1490.70 will signal a resumption of the downtrend.\n\nThe minor trend is up. This is driving the upside momentum.\n\nThe short-term range is $1566.20 to $1490.70. The market is currently trading on the strong side of its retracement zone at $1528.50 to $1537.40. This is helping to generate today\u2019s late session upside bias.\n\nThe main support is a retracement zone at $1489.10 to $1471.00.\n\nDaily Technical Forecast\n\nBased on the early price action and the current price at $1539.80, the direction of the December Comex gold market into the close is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the price cluster at $1537.40 to $1538.30.\n\nBullish Scenario\n\nA sustained move over $1538.30 will indicate the presence of buyers. This could trigger a surge into the next downtrending Gann angle at $1552.30.\n\nTaking out $1552.30 will indicate the buying is getting stronger with the next targets a downtrending Gann angle at $1559.30 and an uptrending Gann angle at $1560.70.\n\nCrossing to the strong side of the angle at $1560.70 will put the market in a bullish position.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA sustained move under $1537.40 will signal the presence of sellers. If this move creates enough late session pressure then look for the selling to possibly extend into the short-term 50% level at $1528.50 and an uptrending Gann angle at $1522.70.\n\nOverview\n\nWatch for a possible spike to the upside later today or early Wednesday if Pelosi decides to move forward with impeachment proceedings.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Based on the early price action and the current price at $1539.80, the direction of the December Comex gold market into the close is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the price cluster at $1537.40 to $1538.30.", "authors": ["James Hyerczyk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/80ubF9yyefID9jJB4Tc0lw--~B/aD00MDI7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/8bd7bf4d4f4c3f5cf52ce93a5250a485", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
