The decision \"could make wider flu outbreaks more likely,\" and that could put government workers and the American public at risk, according to the letter, signed by 13 Democratic senators.\n\nCBP has not responded to a CNN email requesting comment.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all people older than the age of 6 months get a flu vaccine by the end of October.
