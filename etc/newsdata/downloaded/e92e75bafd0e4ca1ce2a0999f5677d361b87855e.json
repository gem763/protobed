Recently, a game was stopped in Italy because of that and then everything else is hypothetical because we don\u2019t know the situation that we\u2019ll be in as a team, or that I\u2019ll be in as a manager. But, we\u2019re very clear in terms of all of the staff, what would need to happen. We want the players to be able to concentrate on football. They want to be judged on their football and what I\u2019ve got to do is provide a safe and secure environment to play.\u201d\n\nIt was put to him that Abraham\u2019s view ran contrary to this.\n\n\u201cI think what we would experience, as a group, over the next few days are a huge number of questions and anybody that gets one slight nuance that\u2019s adrift of the general feeling and what was discussed as a group is going to be flagged as a possible disagreement. That\u2019s absolutely not the case. Everybody is very clear. I\u2019m so conscious, the most important thing for me, my players are being put in very difficult situations every time they\u2019re questioned on the subject. You feel that one word out of place, one incorrect phrasing leads to possible problems that could be flagged towards another team, made to make a story towards another team or potentially made to look as if there\u2019s a split or a disagreement within our camp.\n\n\"We\u2019re 100% united on how we see things. As I say, I want the players to be able to concentrate on football. I would be surprised if there\u2019s ever been a team that\u2019s as well-prepared over the last two years for anything as our team. And I think the players also, at the same time, have the right to have a voice and to speak their mind openly, and I encourage them to do that because we have a chance to make a difference on a very important topic as well. But, my priority is creating the environment that they feel, going into any match, they can focus on football and each other and be judged on that.\u201d\n\nLastly, and arguably most impressively, there was the manner he smoothed things with Bulgaria ahead of Monday\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cI can totally understand why the Bulgarian president feels as he does because we have purely been responding honestly to questions we\u2019ve been asked by you guys. That will then be relayed however it may be relayed in Bulgaria, and the way that that\u2019s pitched could appear provocative or appear that we\u2019re the people who are laying the subject on the table. So, if I was him, and I was only reading those quotes and not knowing the context of why the things were said and the responses were said, then I would feel probably as he does. We are not trying to create a situation at all, far from it. We\u2019re all hoping that over the next 72 hours, we\u2019re just talking about two football matches.\n\n\"I think both countries would have a strong desire for that and I have to say again, we don\u2019t look at other countries in a way that we don\u2019t shine a mirror on our own. What happened in Hartlepool a couple of weeks ago [where Dover players] were subjected to racist abuse] was probably worse than things I\u2019ve seen or heard about in many other countries in the world. So, I think we have to be very careful in how we cover everything.\u201d\n\nSerious as the subject is, it says much about how forgiving the entire group has been for England as a team that it was given such prominence, especially since most of the discussion concerned the second game in this two-header.\n\nThe tension that should have been reserved for a night that could clinch qualification was instead about the possibility of incidents like that, and to a lesser extent the prospect for trouble with up to 5,000 England fans travelling to a famous stag-party destination on a Friday night.\n\nThe reality is that the group has been very easy for Southgate\u2019s side, and they have already put nine past their next two opponents - two previous giants of the European game - in their last two games.\n\nThe England manager did not feel the 5-0 at Wembley in March against Czech Republic was a fair reflection.\n\n\u201cAlthough we played well, the scoreline probably flattered us a bit, so we know tomorrow will be a tough game for us but a good challenge and one that we know if we get the right result, we can qualify for the European Championship, so it\u2019s a game with high motivation for us.\u201d\n\nIt is not a game of high intrigue, though.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s opportunity to experiment has been curtailed by the illness to James Maddison.\n\nHis potential inclusion - and what would have been a first cap - offered the main selection intrigue to this game. As it is, we\u2019re likely to see a similar midfield to usual, and it is highly unlikely that Harry Kane will be replaced by Tammy Abraham in the starting line-up - regardless of their finishing form right now.\n\nEven the question over whether Jadon Sancho will be picked over Marcus Rashford seems less important, because of the drastic difference in form between the two.\n\nIt is thereby a weekend that is unlikely to provoke too many discussions on the pitch.\n\nOff it, however, could be a different matter.\n\nThat is where the real tension is, even as England face up to another qualification.", "description": "If the path to Euro 2020 has been relatively straightforward for England, to the point that they could well achieve qualification in Prague against Czech Republic on Friday with two games to spare, the question that dominated the build-up to that game was anything but.
