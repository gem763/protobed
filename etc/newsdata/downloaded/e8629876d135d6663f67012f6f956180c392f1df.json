In truth, it would be more worrying if high-momentum stocks \u2014 the past year\u2019s top performers \u2014 were soaring right now.\n\nThese high-momentum stocks tend to perform particularly well when market volatility is low, as I discussed in a recent column. They also tend to suffer during bear markets.\n\nBut how do these stocks perform in the final stage of a bull market? Could momentum stocks be a canary in the coal mine, the first to exhibit the early warning signs of a new bear market?\n\nRead: Momentum stock strategies are down \u2014 but not out\n\nMany investors and advisers believe that to be true, and for that reason they are particularly concerned right now. That\u2019s because high-momentum stocks have had it rough over the past couple of months, as you can see from the accompanying chart.\n\nThis lagging momentum has shown up in some of the previously highest-flying Wall Street darlings, as illustrated by these grim stock-price statistics:\n\n\u2022 Netflix NFLX, -1.78% : 30% below its 52-week high\n\n\u2022 Uber Technologies UBER, +1.23% : 31% below\n\n\u2022 Beyond Meat BYND, -4.53% : 35% below.\n\n\u2022 Lyft LYFT, -2.41% : 48% below\n\n\u2022 Tilray TLRY, -2.79% : 84% below.\n\nAnxiety-provoking as these statistics are, there actually is a silver lining. Contrary to conventional wisdom, high-momentum stocks typically do not fade as a bull market approaches its end. In fact, such stocks often produce some of their most spectacular gains in the weeks prior to the final top.\n\nI reached this conclusion after analyzing a hypothetical portfolio constructed to always contain the 10% of publicly-traded stocks with the best trailing-year performance, reconfigured monthly. For the performance of this portfolio, I relied on data from Dartmouth College finance professor Ken French; to find out how it performed during the last weeks of bull markets, I relied on the bull/bear market calendar maintained by Ned Davis Research.\n\nSince 1926, this portfolio produced an annualized return of 74.0% in the last three months of bull markets. That\u2019s nearly double the 38.7% annualized return during all but the last three months of bull markets, and a 24.2% annualized loss during bear markets. (These returns are before transaction costs.)\n\nAccordingly, momentum\u2019s recent struggles suggest that a major market top is not imminent. You instead would want to worry when the recent past\u2019s highest-flying stocks are not just continuing to rise, but soaring. So for the moment, at least, momentum strategies\u2019 struggles are not a reason to worry. If anything, they might be keeping the bull market alive.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch. His Hulbert Ratings tracks investment newsletters that pay a flat fee to be audited.
