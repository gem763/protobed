How can you take that as a serious credible charge?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all being done in secret but it can\u2019t stay in secret. I mean it has to come out at some point.\"\n\nHOUSE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY IS 'POLITICAL REVENGE,' 'SHOULD BE DISMISSED QUICKLY' IN SENATE, LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS\n\nGingrich\u2019s comments come after Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the Trump impeachment inquiry should be immediately rejected by the Senate because of its partisan and biased nature.\n\nThe White House and congressional Republicans have been virtually \"shut out\" of the House's proceedings, which therefore taints the otherwise formal process, Graham told \"Hannity\" on Tuesday.\n\nREP. AL GREEN SAYS PRESIDENT IS 'NO BETTER THAN' KKK IN WAKE OF 'LYNCHING' TWEET\n\nGingrich, meanwhile, added: \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is by selective leaking, they\u2019re smearing the president. They think in the long run, they\u2019re weakening him. I don\u2019t.\"\n\nHe said that the House's process is \"outlawed\" and should not be accepted by the Senate.\n\n\"This system of a secret hearing was outlawed in 1641 because it is inherently to the advantage of the state to crush the individual,\" Gingrich said, \"so we have not seen anything like this in almost 400 years.\u201d\n\nTrump has come under fire from House Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter's business dealings in the country. Democrats have accused Trump of attempting to set up a quid pro quo using military aid to Ukraine as leverage, though Trump has denied the accusation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn the call, which was flagged as part of a whistleblower complaint, Trump urged Zelensky to look into possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election as well as into the conduct of Biden and his son Hunter in the country.\n\nFox News\u2019 Charles Creitz contributed to this report.", "description": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d on Wednesday that the House Democrats' impeachment push is a \u201crigged game\u201d and they're wrong to believe it will weaken President Trump.", "authors": ["Joshua Nelson", "Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-11.02.10-AM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
