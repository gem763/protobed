In many cases, as The Associated Press reported, related health problems including diabetes and high blood pressure disappeared after surgery.\n\nWhile most of those studies involved teens, one study included children younger than 12 and found no ill effects on growth, the policy said.\n\n5 EASY HALLOWEEN TREATS TO MAKE THIS YEAR\n\nRecent data show, as the AP reported, that pediatric obesity surgery rates have tripled in almost 20 years but still average fewer than 2,000 operations each year.\n\nThe academy\u2019s recommendation said children and teens are generally eligible for surgery if their body mass index is 40 or higher, or at least 35 if they have related major health problems.\n\nThese criteria may vary by gender and age, said Dr. Sarah Armstrong, a Duke University pediatrics professor and the policy\u2019s lead author.\n\nThey are similar to criteria for surgeons from the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.\n\nA BMI of 30 and above is considered obese.\n\nMost kids don\u2019t get obesity surgery, mainly because most public and private health insurance doesn\u2019t cover it or they live far from surgery centers, said Armstrong.\n\nCosts can total at least $20,000.\n\nIt\u2019s not a quick fix, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifelong decision with implications every single day for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nMany obese kids already have developed related health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea and liver disease.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe condition of obesity affected 93.3 million adults in the country from 2015 to 2016, per the CDC.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Nearly 5 million U.S. children and teens are severely obese, a near doubling over 20 years, and now according to new recommendations, some severely obese preteens should be considered for weight loss surgery.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
