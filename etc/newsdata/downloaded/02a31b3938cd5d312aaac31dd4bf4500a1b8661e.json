The gun was buried in a wooded area by one of the people who had been in the vehicle with the accused. (Court exhibit)\n\nThe teen opened fire, shooting Stewin in the head and causing the SUV to veer off the highway and crash into a tree.\n\nDuring the trial, there was evidence the boy confessed to the shooting to a friend in Facebook messages.\n\nOther key evidence included the testimony of eyewitnesses \u2014 other young people from Morley who were in the same car as the shooter and identified the teen as the one who pulled the trigger.\n\n\"I find that the three witnesses ... each in their own way and each from their own position and perspective identify [the teen] as the shooter,\" Gaschler wrote in his decision.\n\nBut defence lawyer Balfour Der said he was expecting an acquittal based on those witnesses.\n\n\"I'm actually quite disappointed,\" said Der after the decision was handed down.\n\n\"I thought there was plenty of reasonable doubt in this case based primarily on the quality of these witnesses the prosecution called. After cross-examination I don't know you could have believed anything they said.\"\n\nThese eight bullet fragments were removed from Horst Stewin's brain by German doctors three weeks after he was shot while driving west of Calgary. (Court Exhibit)\n\nStewin survived and was eventually flown back to Germany, where doctors removed eight bullet fragments from his brain.\n\nThe 61-year old has still not fully recovered and will suffer lifelong injuries.\n\nHe is paralyzed on his right side, has trouble speaking and likely will never work again.\n\nA sentencing hearing will take place in February.\n\nDer said he is considering an appeal.\n\nThe boy will turn 18 in two weeks. He smiled at two family members, including his grandmother, who were in court Friday for the decision.", "description": "A judge in Calgary has found a youth guilty in the shooting of a German tourist who was driving on a highway west of the city in the summer of 2018, leaving the tourist seriously injured.", "authors": ["Cbc Calgary Reporter", "Meghan Grant Is The Courts", "Crime Reporter For Cbc Calgary.", "Follow Her On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5212696.1563224837!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/german-tourist-shot-trial-teen-photo-exhibit.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
