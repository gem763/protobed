And kids stare a lot.\n\n\u2018I think that in society, there\u2019s just like a norm and stereotype that people of same weight are supposed to be in a relationship.\u2019\n\nDalreece and Jarreth are sick of the stares they get (Picture: Barcroft TV)\n\nAs well as being subject to public scrutiny, Jarreth has been accused of having a fat fetish \u2013 or even being a \u2018feeder\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u2018Assumptions people might have is that I have a fat fetish or that I am a chubby chaser.\u2019\n\nDalreece added: \u2018Being a feeder is also a thing with big size couples. Where the guy feeds the woman, which is not the case at all.\u2019\n\nTerms like \u2018interweight\u2019 and \u2018mixed-weight\u2019 (which describe relationships where one person weighs substantially more than the other) were alien to Jarreth and Dalreece, and they don\u2019t like the idea of a couple being labelled just because of their respective appearances.\n\nDalreece said: \u2018Honestly, I never really heard about \u201cinterweight\u201d or \u201cmixed-weight\u201d couples before this point. We didn\u2019t really know that it was a thing.\n\nThey\u2019re very happy together (Picture: Barcroft TV)\n\n\u2018I guess every day; we are challenging the stereotypes by being together. And being happy actually, because I think that goes a long way. And I think there\u2019s a lot of stigma with being overweight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Obviously, there\u2019s other things that you could be worse at or have other problems. But I do feel like we are a long way to removing all the stigma that comes with being overweight.\u2019\n\nThe couple first met three years ago on Tinder.\n\nAfter matching, they started messaging on a regular basis and eventually made plans to meet up in real life.\n\nConscious of her size, Dalreece had only posted photos of her face, so she sent Jarreth a full-length photo of herself, worried he wouldn\u2019t want to date her anymore.\n\nDalreece was worried Jarreth wouldn\u2019t like her (Picture: Barcroft TV)\n\nShe said: \u2018I was like: \u201cif you want to be friends, it\u2019s fine, just tell me now I don\u2019t want us to meet and then\u2026 [Jarreth not like her].\u201d\n\n\u2018In the past I did experience with guys not really wanting to talk to me because my weight and things like that.\n\n\u2018I have had experiences where I would meet guys online and they wouldn\u2019t really want to meet afterwards.\u2019\n\nBut for Jarreth, Dalreece\u2019s size didn\u2019t even come into it. The couple got married just over a year ago and are happier than ever.\n\nJarreth said: \u2018I just see Dalreece as a person.\n\n\u2018Not a fat person. Not a chubby person, she\u2019s my wife and she\u2019s the person that I love. The person that I that I\u2019m spending my life with.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s what she is to me.\u2019\n\nOn a body positivity journey of her own, Dalreece has come to embrace her figure and says that being in a supportive, loving marriage has helped her love herself more, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018I was always self-conscious and didn\u2019t really want to post full-body pics and things like that.\n\n\u2018But after we met, I think I just I loosened up a lot and became a lot less self-conscious and a lot more forthcoming and honest with myself and with my following.\u2019\n\nJarreth added: \u2018To people out there who think that men can\u2019t love a larger woman. It\u2019s just superficial.\n\n\u2018You, you get to know the person and you get to see what\u2019s inside.\n\n\u2018Society\u2019s thinking is just skewed. Unfortunately, that is just the way it is. But it\u2019s possible you can get to know.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not about the aesthetics, it\u2019s about what\u2019s inside that matters.\u2019\n\nMORE: Girl designs Christmas cards to raise money for accessible room for disabled brother\n\nAD FEATURE: Here are seven reasons why you\u2019re going to want to visit Orlando this winter\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A couple are sick of the stares and comments they get from the public because of their difference in weight.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1572015256_1572019999.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
