First, defensive end Nick Bosa hydroplaned on his belly to celebrate. A few teammates on the field joined in, with defensive tackle D.J. Jones creating a splash with his hook slide.\n\nThen, multiple players on San Francisco\u2019s sideline dove and slid onto the field as Washington coach Bill Callahan walked to meet his counterpart for the postgame handshake at midfield. He almost had to wait because 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan contemplated taking a plunge with his players.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely fun watching our whole team slide across the field at the end,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI did think about joining, but I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve done it right.\u201d\n\nWhile the visitors and their fans frolicked in the wet conditions, the home team departed to dry out and begin preparations for Thursday\u2019s game at Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m thinking about right now is that it\u2019s going to be about 70 degrees with zero chance of rain,\u201d Keenum said about facing the team he led to the NFC title game two seasons ago.\n\nAs far as San Francisco was concerned, FedEx Field was a beach, the mud was sand, and the skies were clear and bright. It\u2019s impossible to have a different outlook after improving to 6-0 with a shutout victory, even though the game was uglier than the weather. The eyesore produced 437 yards of total offense combined. Unfortunately for Washington, the Niners contributed about two-thirds of that output.\n\nOn a day built for ground attacks, Washington seemed well-suited early on, picking up 67 of its 104 rushing yards in the first quarter, paced by running back Adrian Peterson. Washington began the game with seven consecutive runs by Peterson, who had 49 yards on an opening drive that ended in frustration when Dustin Hopkins missed a 39-yard kick.\n\nKeenum attempted only a dozen passes, including a couple of the shovel variety to Steven Sims Jr. We know Callahan is committed to running the ball more often than his predecessor, Jay Gruden, but averaging just a pair of legitimate forward passes per quarter seems a bit much.\n\n\u201cThe conditions, on both sides, played into the decision to run the ball a little more and obviously be more controlled in the pass and limit the pass attempts,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThat was more field conditions and weather conditions.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s game, in the controlled environment of U.S. Bank Stadium, will help us determine how much was due to precipitation and how much is simply Callahan\u2019s preference. Washington\u2019s season-low in passing attempts prior to Sunday occurred in Callahan\u2019s debut as interim coach, when Keenum threw 25 passes as Washington\u2018 barely hung on against hapless Miami for their first victory.\n\nSunday\u2019s climate actually could be an apt metaphor for Washington\u2019s current circumstances. Maybe the offense will be forced to rely on Peterson\u2019s ancient legs \u2014 regardless of the meteorological forecast \u2014 because none of the quarterbacks can be trusted and most of the receivers are pedestrian.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, Washington will have to grin and bear it as more teams celebrate like 6-year-olds at a pool party.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun,\u201d 49ers defensive tackle DeForest Buckner said of the postgame mud angels and baby seal imitations. \u201cIt was definitely worth it. Everybody started sliding around and everything. It was like a bunch of little kids out there. That\u2019s part of the game, having fun, and right now we\u2019re having a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nWinning has that effect on a team, and a little water doesn\u2019t make a difference. But for Washington, when it rains it pours \u2026 and not in a good way.\n\nThe season is slip-sliding away, with darker clouds ahead.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
