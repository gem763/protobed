He did not elaborate.\n\nEsper had initially told reporters troops withdrawing from Syria would go to western Iraq to fight Islamic State and \u201chelp defend Iraq,\u201d but he appeared to row back on Tuesday, saying Washington aimed to eventually bring them home.\n\nEsper also met on Wednesday his Iraqi counterpart Defence Minister Najah al-Shammari. They discussed military cooperation and \u201cconsulted over the military events the region is going through,\u201d the Iraqi defense ministry said in a statement.\n\nIraq is one of the regional allies that has closely watched President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to abruptly withdraw from northern Syria and withhold protection from Kurdish fighters that had helped U.S. troops fight against Islamic State.\n\nIraq hosts a separate force of around 5,000 troops that helped fight Islamic State. But it is also friendly with Washington\u2019s enemy Iran.\n\nU.S. troops occupied Iraq from 2003-2011 and are deeply unpopular in much of the country. Abdul Mahdi has faced a crisis over violent anti-corruption protests in recent weeks, leaving him with little political capital to spend defending U.S. ties.\n\n\u201cIraqi politics are in a delicate state. There\u2019s no Iraqi support for the country becoming a principal U.S. garrison in the Middle East,\u201d said Jon Alterman, Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.", "description": "Iraq rejected on Wednesday the long-term presence of U.S. troops that have crossed its border during a retreat from northern Syria, an apparent snub to visiting Defence Secretary Mark Esper who had initially said the troops would stay in Iraq.", "authors": ["Idrees Ali", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444172456&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0ME", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
