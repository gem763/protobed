We let them run twice, got nervous a little bit and our process to create chances was not good,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"We were not organised and lost balls in positions we could not lose them in. We had problems on the counter-attack in the end and it was a bad day.\"\n\nCity were again made to pay for a serious of key defensive injuries and badly missed the creativity of Kevin De Bruyne in midfield.\n\nWolves had two days less rest and a trip back from Istanbul to cope with after winning at Besiktas in the Europa League on Thursday night.\n\nHowever they never tired and finally took their chances through Traore in the final 10 minutes.\n\nTwice in a matter of moments during the first half, Raul Jimenez was played through by loose passes from City players, but the Mexican striker was unable to convert either opportunity.\n\nHe was first denied by an excellent tackle from Fernandinho and on the second chance he delayed and failed to get his shot away, although he felt he was impeded by City's makeshift central defender and should have been given a penalty.\n\nCity looked like the team suffering a European hangover as they struggled to move the ball with their usual fluidity and Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patricio was not called into action until past the half-hour mark when he pushed away Raheem Sterling's shot.\n\nGuardiola was not happy and made a tactical switch at half-time as he sent on Oleksandr Zinchenko in place of Kyle Walker and pushed Joao Cancelo over to his preferred right-back position.\n\nBut there was not the speed in City's play or the space to open up their opponents, even after Bernardo Silva was summoned from the bench for Riyad Mahrez.\n\nThe breakthrough they so badly wanted almost came when David Silva was brought down just outside the area before picking himself up to curl the free-kick against the crossbar.\n\nBut with 10 minutes remaining, the decisive blow was delivered by Traore as he coolly slotted past Ederson after Jimenez had skipped away from Nicolas Otamendi for his first goal since August 2018.\n\nAnd in the final minute of injury time with City pushing men forward, Traore repeated the trick when he was put clear with an almost identical goal as he beat Ederson again.", "description": "Manchester City's bid to win a third successive Premier League title suffered a huge setback as the champions crashed to a shock defeat against Wolves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7401/206e5509559d4179bdea9c3fa537a513.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
