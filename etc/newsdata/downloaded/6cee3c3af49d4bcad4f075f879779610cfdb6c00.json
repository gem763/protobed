Devin Nunes\u2019 appearance on Hannity, escalated with arrests of figures tied to Rudy Giuliani, and will possibly come to a complete halt when former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch meets with three House committees tomorrow \u2014 assuming the State Department allows the testimony to take place at all.\n\nKicking this off, Nunes went on Hannity last night to claim that Yavonovitch may have been spying on Americans \u2014 including journalists. Sean Hannity expresses his anger over what his own sources are telling him about surveillance of John Solomon among others, although Nunes more cautiously advises patience:\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you is that we know what Pete Sessions, congressman from Texas now retired, we know what he had to say. We know that there are people within that were not only Ukrainians but also Americans that worked at the State Department who have raised concerns about this ambassador, that\u2019s why she was ultimately removed,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cWe also have concerns that possibly they were monitoring press from different journalists and others,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat we don\u2019t know, but, you know, we have people who have given us this information and we\u2019re going to ask these questions to the State Department and hopefully they\u2019ll get the answers before she comes in on Friday.\u201d Hannity then said three sources have told him there \u201cis evidence that shows government resources were used to monitor communications\u201d of a journalist, The Hill\u2019s John Solomon. \u201cWell, what I have heard, and I want to be clear. I think there is a difference. What I\u2019ve heard is that there were strange requests, irregular requests to monitor, not just one journalist, but multiple journalists,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cNow perhaps that was okay. Perhaps there was some reason for that, that it can be explained away. But that\u2019s what we know and that\u2019s what we are going to be looking into.\u201d\n\nKeep Pete Sessions in mind as our ride progresses to its next sharp turn. Earlier today, two of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s clients \u2014 and donors to a PAC funding Giuliani\u2019s investigation of the Bidens \u2014 got arrested for criminal campaign finance violations. Among the allegations are that those violations intended to mask foreign influence on US elections:\n\nTwo Soviet-born donors to a pro- Trump fundraising committee who helped Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate Democrat Joe Biden were arrested late Wednesday on criminal charges of violating campaign finance rules, including funneling Russian money into President Trump\u2019s campaign. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Florida businessmen, have been under investigation by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, and are expected to appear in federal court in Virginia later on Thursday, the people said. Both men were born in former Soviet republics.\n\nMr. Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s private lawyer, identified the two men in May as his clients. Both men have donated to Republican campaigns including Mr. Trump\u2019s, and in May 2018 gave $325,000 to the primary pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, through an LLC called Global Energy Producers, according to Federal Election Commission records. The men were charged with four counts, including conspiracy, falsification of records and lying to the FEC about their political donations, according to the indictment that outlines a conspiracy to funnel a Russian donor\u2019s money into U.S. elections.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the two have been instrumental in helping Giuliani make contacts in Ukraine. One of them happened to be part of a meeting Giuliani had with the now-unemployed envoy Kurt Volker:\n\nSince late 2018, Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas have introduced Mr. Giuliani to several current and former senior Ukrainian prosecutors to discuss the Biden case. Mr. Parnas in July accompanied Mr. Giuliani to a breakfast meeting with Kurt Volker, then the U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. \u201cWe had a long conversation about Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Volker wrote in his testimony to House committees last week. During that breakfast, Mr. Giuliani mentioned the investigations he was pursuing into Mr. Biden and 2016 election interference.\n\nThe indictment released today has a very telling reference to a former US congressman who involved himself in the effort to oust Yovanovitch:\n\nAnd now let\u2019s go back to the WSJ for some dot-connecting:\n\nIn May 2018, Pete Sessions, at the time a GOP congressman from Texas, sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking for her removal, saying he had been told Ms. Yovanovitch was displaying a bias against the president in private conversations. \u2026 The indictment references a congressman, identifiable as Mr. Sessions, whose assistance Mr. Parnas sought in \u201ccausing the U.S. government to remove or recall the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.\u201d The indictment says those efforts were conducted \u201cat least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.\u201d Mr. Sessions didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nHoo boy. If nothing else, this certainly looks bad, which makes Nunes\u2019 citation of Session suspect on its face. The Department of Justice is essentially accusing Sessions of being bought by foreign influence in going after Yovanovitch, and clearly intends to press that case against Giuliani\u2019s associates on that basis.\n\nBear in mind that this is William Barr\u2019s DoJ, too. Barr got read into the case soon after taking over the Attorney General job in February, and apparently found it convincing enough to proceed to indictment. The arrest also made it very convenient for House Democrats to issue subpoenas for testimony from the pair, although it likely complicates how cooperative they\u2019re willing to be. At the very least, they\u2019ll be easy to find.\n\nGiuliani responded by attacking the DoJ for its \u201cextremely suspect\u201d timing in unsealing the indictment and arresting his associates. He promised Fox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge that he would shortly reveal how all of this is connected to his investigation into the Bidens:\n\nFox News: Giuliani says timing of the arrests of his associates are \"extremely suspect\" and that he believes they're \"connected\" to his investigations in Ukraine pic.twitter.com/1HerrwOJhD \u2014 TPM Livewire (@TPMLiveWire) October 10, 2019\n\nWhat about the \u201cextremely suspect\u201d timing? It turns out that the pair were trying to leave the country, which forced the DoJ to make the arrests now:\n\nThe two Giuliani-linked defendants, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, were detained at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington on Wednesday and are scheduled to appear in court in Virginia at 2 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, Yovanovitch continues to prepare for her own testimony, which is still scheduled to take place tomorrow. The Washington Post reported late last night that she\u2019s \u201con board\u201d for cooperating with the committees, and perhaps now even more so after Nunes\u2019 allegations on Hannity last night. The State Department could still bar her from discussing her work with Congress (she remains employed by State), but ABC reports today that Mike Pompeo is already facing a rising level of discontent over Yovanovitch\u2019s treatment and Pompeo\u2019s lack of a public defense for her:\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, who was recalled early from her post this spring, is scheduled for a deposition Friday with three committees in the House of Representatives, but it is unclear whether she will be allowed to show up after the U.S. ambassador to the European Union was blocked by the Trump administration from testifying on Tuesday. Either way, the manner in which Yovanovitch has been treated by Trump and the silence from Pompeo has already rankled many rank and file at the State Department, according to half a dozen current and former officials, who are also upset by the administration\u2019s use of career diplomats in the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political opponents.\n\nSo where does this ride come to a stop? How much of this is true \u2014 all of it, none of it, or only some of it? Trump loyalists will surely consider all of this as more evidence of a Deep State plot that now involves both the State and Justice Departments. Trump haters will see this as another case of foreign influence on the administration and a plot to smear Trump\u2019s opponents, both electoral and otherwise. The rest of America might just be hoping that the [expletive deleted] ride would come to an end, period.\n\nAt this point, the mess is too complicated to suss out which conclusion reflects the truth. What does appear to true is that we\u2019re not going to know for sure what\u2019s true for a long, long time \u2014 and it might turn out, ironically, that the DoJ could end up as the most credible player in Ukraine-Gate.", "description": "Plus: DoJ indicts Giuliani associates for campaign finance violations to mask foreign influence.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nunes-fox.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
