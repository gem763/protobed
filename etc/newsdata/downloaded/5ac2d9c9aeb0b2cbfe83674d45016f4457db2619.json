This move sent shares sliding, losing more than 22%. In its earnings revision, Hexo said fourth-quarter revenue will be between C$14.5 million (US$10.96 million) and C$16.5 million (US$11.04 million), below its previous predictions that had pegged revenues being twice as much as its third-quarter figures of C$13 million (US$9.83 million).\n\nLast Thursday, Hexo announced it was laying off 200 employees, including management staff. The layoffs will affect all departments and facilities. Among the key management personnel leaving is its chief manufacturing officer and chief marketing officer. The company had just over 1,000 employees.\n\nIn the past week, the company\u2019s stock price went from US$2.74 (C$3.80) on Oct. 18 to close yesterday at US$2.32 (C$3.03), a 15.3% (20.2%) plunge.\n\nHexo Weekly Chart\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to turn the tide on the bad news, Hexo released a statement yesterday announcing it has received a research and development license from Health Canada for its Centre of Excellence in Belleville, Ont. The licence expands the scope of activities the company can conduct on cannabis and its derivatives.\n\n\u201cThe research license will allow us to take our innovation work to the next level, with testing on derivative products, including taste testing,\u201d said Hexo CEO and co-founder Sebastien St-Louis. \u201cConsumers have high expectations for their packaged goods experiences, and cannabis will be no different.\u201d\n\nThe facility will serve as a production and distribution hub as it ratchets up to offer cannabis derivative products. Earlier this month, Hexo provided notice to Health Canada that it would be producing new products that fall into the newly legalized cannabis-infused products. The company has also recently been issued an amended license that will allow it market cannabis topical, extracts and edibles from its cultivation and production facility in Gatineau, Que.\n\nFirms Specializing In CBD Extraction Attracting Attention\n\nWith marijuana-infused products, including beverages, and a wide array of edibles now legal in Canada, the cannabis market is looking ahead to the size and expectations of these so-called 2.0 products. With this shift, companies that specialize in the extraction and processing of CBD oil are attracting more attention.\n\nIn fact, one such company, Valens GroWorks Corp (OTC: ), (TSXV: ), has seen its stock jump slightly more than 7% since the middle of October.\n\nValens GroWorks specializes in an extraction method, distillation and purifies cannabinoid isolation. Being able to produce CBD isolate that is consistent and measurable to be able to be used as an ingredient in commercially available consumer products is key. And Valens GroWorks has secured contracts to do just that with several major companies in the cannabis space. These companies include Tilray (NASDAQ: ), Canopy Growth (NYSE: ), (TSX: ), Green Organic Dutchman (OTC: ), (TSX: ) and OrganiGram (NASDAQ: ), (TSX: ).\n\nShares of Valens GroWorks closed down 2.58% yesterday in Toronto and New York.\n\nValens GroWorks Weekly Chart\n\nAnother company emerging as a major extractor is MediPharm Labs Corp (OTC: ), (TSX: ). The Ontario-based company specializes in purified pharmaceutical-grade cannabis oil extract needed for derivative products. Its shares gained more than 43% in the U.S. and 44% in Canada since the close on Oct. 1 They closed yesterday at US$3.67 (C$4.81), down 2.24% on the day.\n\nMediPharm has secured strategic partnerships with Canopy, as well as other companies, including Cronos (NASDAQ: ), (TSX: ), Emerald Health Therapeutics (OTC: ), (TSXV: ) and Supreme Cannabis (OTC: ), (TSX: ).\n\nFinland, Germany Edging Toward Legalization\n\nFinland is headed toward decriminalizing cannabis. According to an Oct. 25 report by YLE, the Finland\u2019s national public broadcaster, a citizens\u2019 initiative calling for the legalization of the weed will be considered by the country\u2019s members of parliament after receiving the required 50,000 signatures from residents.\n\nThe initiative requests the decriminalization of possession of marijuana, and that the use and cultivation of small amounts of the substance be permitted.\n\nIn Germany, the government is considering legalizing recreational cannabis. According to news reports, the German government is weighing the move, imposing control measures on production and distribution. Right now, cannabis is only legal for medical use. It production, sale and importation is strictly controlled by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com) covering: Emerald Health Therapeutics Inc, Canopy Growth Corp, OrganiGram Holdings Inc, Hexo Corp.
