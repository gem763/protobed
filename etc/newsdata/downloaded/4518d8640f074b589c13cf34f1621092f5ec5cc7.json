They\u2019re already fighting Philadelphia 76er Mike Scott for wearing a Redskins jersey pic.twitter.com/iYenL28bnr \u2014 Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) September 8, 2019\n\nScott, formerly of the Washington Wizards, is from Chesapeake, Virginia and played his college basketball for the University of Virginia. He\u2019s only played for the Sixers since the Clippers traded him there in February, and it appears he hasn\u2019t given up his Redskins fandom to support all Philadelphia teams.\n\nFew other details are known about the scuffle. It appears Scott may have thrown a punch or shove that put an Eagles fan on the ground, but Scott appeared to be outnumbered and acting in self-defense.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Scott stayed to take selfies, according to posts by other fans. Before Sunday, Scott has become a popular player in Philadelphia in his short time with the 76ers. He has responded to invitations on social media and showed up to hang out with fans. He even attended a wedding reception earlier in the summer.\n\nBased in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
