They're clunky, heavy and their functionality is pretty limited right now. But a new report claims Apple might be throwing its hat in the AR headset ring anyway. The report claimed to have discovered code on iOS 13 suggesting there's one on the way. Here's what we know.

However, because rumoured Apple\u2019s headset would presumably never be very far from its companion iPhone, concerns about ultra-wideband\u2019s limited range wouldn\u2019t really be an issue.\n\nRumours claim Apple\u2019s headset will also get its own operating system based on iOS called rOS (\u201creality operating system\u201d), which could support a number of possible uses cases such as heads up directions, hands-free texting, and more.\n\nThat said, for anyone thinking about saving up so they can actually buy Apple\u2019s AR headset at launch, you may want to hold off for now. There\u2019s a good chance this initial headset may only be a developer kit and not a device slated for a full consumer release, as there isn\u2019t much of a reason to sell AR glasses if there\u2019s no content to go with it.\n\nStarting with a dev kit would echo the production cycle of competitors like Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens (which is now on its second generation) and the Magic Leap One. Though if Apple opts for a simpler headset design similar to devices like North\u2019s Focals, or Vuzix\u2019s Blade, Apple may be less hesitant about releasing a consumer-ready headset next year.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s been almost three years since the last time Apple moved into a new product category with the AirPods, so its about time for Apple to expand its device portfolio again.", "description": "Following hints about a potential Apple AR headset\u00a0found in iOS 13 earlier this fall, a new report from a well-respected Apple analyst suggests Apple\u2019s AR glasses could arrive as early as the first half of 2020....", "authors": ["Alex Cranz", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dotzehpwx833a5dekbon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
