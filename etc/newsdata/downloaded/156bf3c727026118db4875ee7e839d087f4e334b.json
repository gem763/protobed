It\u2019s pretty easy to select one and tweak their appearance. In fact, you can do it either from the Watch itself or on your iPhone. And if you\u2019re tired of your current choices, you can always add a new one.\n\nOn your iPhone\n\nTo switch to a previously installed watchface:\n\nOpen the Watch app. You\u2019ll see a scrolling line of the watchfaces you\u2019ve previously installed. Swipe left and right to find the one you want to use or customize, and tap it.\n\nScroll down and tap on \u201cSet as current Watch Face.\u201d You\u2019re good to go.\n\nCustomizing a watchface \u2014 in other words, changing the color, style, or some other aspect \u2014 will work a little differently depending on the features of each particular face. However, the general idea is the same for all of them.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve tapped the face you want, swipe down to see which aspects you can tweak, and swipe across to see what your choices are. For example, if you see an aspect for color, swipe across to see the face\u2019s available color schemes and tap the one you want to use.\n\nIf you want to change an icon on the watchface that launches an app on your Watch \u2014 what Apple calls \u201cComplications\u201d \u2014 tap the appropriate menu item, scroll, and select. Work through the list of available positions, tapping the ones you want to change and picking the Complication you want to use from the scrolling list. When you\u2019ve got it right, go to the bottom of the screen and tap on \u201cSet as current Watch Face.\u201d\n\nTo install a new watchface:\n\nOpen the Watch app. You can see the faces that are already installed near the top of the screen.\n\nTap the Face Gallery icon at the bottom center of your display. Scroll up and down and left and right to behold Apple\u2019s creative bounty.\n\nTap on the one you want to add, tweak the settings a little if you want, and tap \u201cAdd.\u201d The new face will appear on your Watch in short order.\n\nOn your Watch\n\nTo switch to a previously installed watchface:\n\nTo change from among your installed faces, just swipe left or right on the Watch\u2019s screen. That\u2019s it.\n\nCustomizing your watchface is a little more complicated.\n\nForce touch the screen. You\u2019ll feel a vibration, and the watchface will go into Customize mode.\n\nSwipe left and right to pick the face you want to work on, and tap \u201cCustomize.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next depends on which face you want to work with and how complex it is.\n\nGenerally, faces have two or three categories of design that you can change. Each category gets its own screen. The number of screens is indicated by the dots along the top of the display. You can move between the categories by swiping left and right. The area that you can change will be indicated by a green outline and will usually be labeled.\n\nTo make a change (color, style, etc.), scroll through the available options by tapping the area you want to change (if there is more than one area on the display outlined) and rotating the Digital Crown.\n\nThe last screen usually lets you manage the Complications. Things you can change are indicated by circles. Tap what you want to customize and scroll through the available Complications by turning the crown.\n\nGrid View Tap on \u201cCustomize\u201d to tweak your Watch face.\n\nChoose which category you want to change.\n\nSome screens will have several areas you can change.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, press the crown once (a longer press will activate Siri, so don\u2019t linger), and you\u2019ll be brought back to the Customize screen.\n\nLower your wrist, and you\u2019ll be using that customized watchface. If you\u2019re not wearing the Watch, press the crown or tap the screen once to return to the \u201cCustomize\u201d screen and again to get back to normal mode.\n\nTo install a new watchface:\n\nForce touch the screen to enter \u201cCustomize\u201d mode\n\nSwipe left through until you see the \u201cNew\u201d button. Tap it.\n\nEither swipe up and down or turn the crown to run through the available faces. Tap the one you want to add, and you\u2019re set. (You can customize it by following the directions earlier in this article.)", "description": "Decorative and functional watchfaces are a signature feature of the Apple Watch.
