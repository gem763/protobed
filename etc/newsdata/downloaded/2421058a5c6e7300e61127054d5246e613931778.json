Here\u2019s how they coped with FIRE plans gone wrong", "language": "en", "text": "Gwen Merz, 28, is doing something she thought she\u2019d never have to do again: hunt for a job.\n\nEarlier in her 20s, she set a goal to \u201cretire\u201d from full-time work at age 35, but she later decided to move that date up to 27.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t going to \u201cretire\u201d completely, but work flexibly after quitting her job. At that time, she planned to move to Minneapolis to be with her boyfriend. She saved more than $130,000 in a 401(k), about $25,000 in a Roth IRA and kept $20,000 in cash. She also had about $5,000 in a taxable investment account and $10,000 in a health savings account. She also hoped to access a pension she had been entitled to.\n\nTo supplement her savings, she planned to rent out a property she purchased. She also co-hosts a podcast, freelances doing content management and sells craft items on an Etsy store.\n\nShe took the leap into \u201cfinancial independence\u201d in March 2017, \u201cecstatic\u201d to experience her new freedom.\n\nBut life had other plans.\n\nThe rental property was too complicated to manage from far away. She found that she hated freelancing. Because of some technicalities, she wasn\u2019t able to access her pension yet. There were fewer bites than expected on her Etsy projects. And she and her boyfriend broke up.\n\nNow, she\u2019s living with her parents until she finds a new, full-time job, back in the IT world where she started.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t regret her choices, she said.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, I had to evaluate the risks,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew the worst-case scenario is that we would break up, I move out and move in with my parents \u2026 I was able to do that because I don\u2019t have anybody depending on me. I can take these risks knowing I\u2019m only affecting myself.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she learned that she doesn\u2019t actually want to \u201cretire\u201d \u2014 at least not yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about myself and the world and what I need in a relationship and what makes me happy and fulfilled in a job,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all of those things, I\u2019m grateful, even if my plans didn\u2019t go the way I wanted them to.\u201d\n\nMerz isn\u2019t alone. The idea of \u201cFIRE\u201d, which stands for \u201cfinancial independence, retire early\u201d \u2014 has gained traction in the past several years. Many members of the movement live frugally to meet their goals, including biking instead of driving a car, limiting the amount they spend on food and travel and even producing their own food and clothing themselves. They connect online, through forums and Facebook groups, to encourage one another in their progress.\n\nBut it\u2019s risky. Before \u201cretirement,\u201d many members of the FIRE movement are working full time jobs \u2014 often lucrative ones \u2014 but they leave all that behind in order to live off their savings for decades.\n\nRead: Why does the early-retirement movement have so many haters?\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t always work out that way.\n\nMr. Money Mustache is largely credited with popularizing the idea of \u201cearly retirement\u201d and encouraging others to spend less in order to work less, too. He was able to retire in his 30s, thanks to a cheap lifestyle, index-fund investing and investing in rental real estate.\n\nHe lays out the amount one needs to retire early on his website: There\u2019s no magic amount because it varies by person.\n\nAspiring retirees must calculate how much money they take home each year and how much they can live on. They should assume 5% investment returns after inflation during their saving years, he says. And they can plan on a 4% \u201csafe withdrawal rate\u201d in retirement, with some flexibility at times. They should also create a \u201csafety margin,\u201d he said, in case anything unexpected happens.\n\nFinancial commentator Suze Orman has said she \u201chates\u201d the early retirement movement because most people don\u2019t save enough.\n\nEarly retirees should actually save upward of $5 million to be on the safe side, Orman said. (And of course, members of the \u201cFIRE\u201d community disagreed.)\n\nBut unexpected events do happen, and that\u2019s why planning how much you\u2019ll need in retirement is so difficult \u2014 at any age, said Rachel Podnos, an attorney and financial adviser based in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cEven people who are relatively sophisticated financially underestimate how much they\u2019re going to need,\u201d she said. Between health care, family responsibilities and housing costs, retirement can be expensive \u2014 and not always in the ways you\u2019re anticipating, she said.\n\nAnd going back to work like Merz did may not always be easy, Podnos said.\n\n\u201cExplaining to your employer you have this gap in your resume because you decided to retire \u2026 I feel like you would have to come up with a really good spin on that.\u201d\n\nThat said, \u201cearly retirement\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean leaving the workforce \u2014 some \u201cFIRE\u201d movement members plan to still work, but won\u2019t need to rely on their full-time incomes any more, said Alison Norris, a certified financial planner and advice strategist at the personal-finance company SoFi.\n\nSome members of the \u201cFIRE\u201d community opened up about ways their retirement isn\u2019t going as expected. Here are just a few of their stories.\n\nThat feeling when your cryptocurrency gets stolen\n\nAlli and Matt Owen, a married couple who are 28 and 29, discovered the \u201cFIRE\u201d movement about four years ago. At the time, they were living in Bakersfield, Calif., working in the oil-and-gas industry and making a combined $250,000 a year. They decided to \u201cretire\u201d in 10 years, from when they found out what \u201cFIRE\u201d was.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t like where we were living and thought of the FI movement as a way to have more freedom,\u201d Alli said. Their goal: Save $1.2 million by then, so they could live off $40,000 a year for the rest of their lives.\n\nBut they both began to struggle with mental health issues including anxiety and depression, and decided to leave their jobs earlier than planned, never reaching that $1.2 million goal. Instead, they left work in April 2018 with a combined net worth of $600,000, to travel around the U.S. for about six months.\n\nThe day before they left, they got some bad news. Their computer had been hacked. And along with it, $17,000 worth of cryptocurrency they bought was gone, too.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d Matt said. \u201cIt was my responsibility to make sure it was safe, and I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of self-doubt, like, \u2018Did we make the right decision leaving our jobs?\u2019\u201d Alli said. \u201cIs this a sign we\u2019re going the wrong direction?\u201d\n\nUltimately, they still took their trip. The $17,000 wasn\u2019t enough to completely derail their plans. But it did put stress on their relationship, they said.\n\nThe Owens don\u2019t know what their futures will hold and whether $600,000 will be enough to support it. For one thing, they want to have children, and they\u2019re not completely sure how much that will cost.\n\nSo to make a little more income, they\u2019ve started two businesses: one to coach others on their finances and another selling a food product for the ketogenic diet.\n\nThey\u2019re not too worried, Matt said.\n\n\u201cThere are other people in the movement who have families,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not very materialistic, they\u2019re not buying a lot of toys and gadgets \u2026 we think kids need a lot of time with us, and that\u2019s the most important.\u201d\n\nWhen an unexpected illness takes hold\n\nLiz, a 38-year-old mother of three boys in Connecticut, has always been interested in personal finance, she says. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly when she could retire, but hoped to meet some level of financial independence by the time she was in her mid-50s.\n\nTo meet that goal, she has not only been a diligent saver, but she also pursued an M.B.A. while working full time, she said. Her habits came in handy six years ago, when her husband almost died of septic shock: an infection that has made it difficult for him to work since.\n\nNow, the family\u2019s retirement plan is almost entirely dependent on Liz, a scenario she never expected when she was in her 20s, she says. She worries about others pursuing \u201cFIRE\u201d while relying on remaining in perfect health, or needing the income of a partner, she says.\n\nShe especially cautions those who may have a plan for health and disability insurance, but don\u2019t factor in additional costs like adapting the home for a disabled family member, or needing to purchase special clothing or foods for them.\n\n\u201cThe folks whose plans are based on nothing going wrong, they\u2019ve had nothing serious happen to them or people close to them,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, life isn\u2019t like that. Some of us learn it the hard way.\u201d\n\nLosing your partner\n\nWilliam McVey, a 45-year-old living in Mason, Ohio, and his wife Amber wanted to retire early even before it was trendy.\n\nThe plan: Once their twin boys were grown up, they would be able to travel as empty nesters. William is a software engineer, and Amber worked in biotech until she became pregnant with their sons. They devoted her entire salary to savings and lived off William\u2019s income alone.\n\nBut in 2009 years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Initially, she recovered and lived cancer free. But the cancer returned in 2012, and she died five years ago. Now, William is solely responsible for caring for their twin boys, who are now 16 years old and both struggle with autism.\n\nThe couple made some smart choices before Amber\u2019s diagnosis and eventual passing, William says. They both had life insurance. Now that Amber\u2019s policy has been cashed, he has earmarked those savings for his sons, but is still able to work flexibly.\n\n\u201cI reached my \u2018FIRE\u2019 numbers in the worst possible way,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued to work after Amber\u2019s death, but felt he was not spending enough time with their boys. That\u2019s why he works more flexibly now, doing freelance work instead of a full-time role.\n\nHis advice for those planning to retire along with a partner: Share everything, including passwords to your financial accounts and an overall savings strategy.\n\nTalk about what you\u2019ll do in case of divorce or death, way in advance, he says. During Amber\u2019s illness, they never wanted to talk about death, what William calls \u201cgoing to the dark place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily regret that, but we should have had these conversations,\u201d he says.\n\nWelcoming new family members\n\nA blogger who goes by \u201cMrs. Simply FI\u201d, 27, and her husband, 31, have a single income of just $26,000 for their family of five.\n\nThey work at a camp in the southwest United States: the husband maintains the camp\u2019s computer system, and the wife takes care of their children, while occasionally picking up cleaning shifts and doing freelance photography. But with the job comes free housing, free internet, medical care and free food during the summer months.\n\nIn the next several years, they plan to buy a school bus and renovate it into a \u201ctiny home,\u201d where they will live with their three children. During that time, the husband may be able to work remotely in IT, but the family will be completely mobile.\n\nThey are evangelical Christians, and they hope to pursue various ministries in their \u201cretirement.\u201d Being financially independent will help them with that, they said.\n\n\u201cOur faith really teaches us that we should be able to leave a legacy for our kids, and for other people too,\u201d Mrs. Simply FI says.\n\nBut of course, it isn\u2019t so easy.\n\nOne of their children is 3 years old and has some special needs, for which he needs occupational and speech therapy. And they\u2019re hoping to add more children to their family through adoption.\n\nIn fact, they recently welcomed a foster child into their home, so they are taking care of four children on the same salary that supported three. That will delay \u201cFIRE\u201d for the family. But that\u2019s OK, Mrs. Simply FI says.\n\n\u201cThe whole point for us is not to achieve a certain number. It\u2019s to build a life for ourselves and our children that is satisfying and reaches the goals that we have,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of that for us is that we love our children and children in general. If we have an opportunity to adopt a child it\u2019s worth it to us to move our date by a year or two to build a life that we\u2019re wanting.\u201d\n\nTime will tell whether they\u2019re able to \u201cretire,\u201d she says. Right now, they\u2019re taking the steps to make it happen, including putting more than half of their income toward remaining student loan debt.\n\nAnd having a nest egg will benefit the family, even if complete retirement isn\u2019t possible, she says.\n\nUnexpected expenses \u201cwould pop up anyway,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least we\u2019d be in a better position when they do happen.\u201d\n\nAdvice for those considering \u2018FIRE\u2019\n\nNo matter what age you\u2019re planning to retire, spend time beforehand imagining what you want your life to look like, Norris of SoFi said. That will help you \u201cassign a price tag to your retirement goal,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd if you save too little, it doesn\u2019t have to be a disaster.\n\nYou may be able to re-enter the workforce. You may have to reduce your spending as much as you can. Homeowners might have to consider a reverse mortgage, which means converting part of your home equity to cash.\n\nJust consider the unknowns that could come up, including market volatility, long-term care needs and any changes in the tax code that could come up, Norris said.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re like Merz, you can take it in stride.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need anyone to tell me, \u2018I told you so,\u2019\u201d Merz said. \u201cThis was something I needed to come to myself. All in all, people have been really supportive.\u201d", "description": "This is what happens when your plans for early retirement are derailed.", "authors": ["Maria Lamagna"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GZ241_Allian_MG_20181128144133.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-29"}
