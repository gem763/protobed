I had my baby inside me and before then I was so excited to hold him.\n\n\u201cWe were to be blessed with a little boy. Then to have to deliver his still body was hell.\u201d\n\nThe maternity unit at Basildon University Hospital has been beset with problems in recent months.\n\nAn inspection by the Care Quality Commission in July criticised the unit, saying some of its practises were not always safe and that it requires improvement.\n\nStela was told that she was going to be induced on March 12 this year when she was 12 days past her due date.\n\n(Image: Essex Live WS)\n\n\u201cI was in pain from contractions on the day of my induction so went into hospital early,\u201d Stela said.\n\n\u201cThe midwife told me that they had other priorities with some labours that were more urgent than mine as I hadn\u2019t had any complications during my pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI asked her if I could at least speak to the doctor. She came back 20 minutes later and said she was sorry, but I had to go home.\n\n\u201cI was having contractions and had had a baby before so I knew that they were the real thing.\n\n\u201cI tried telling the midwife that there was no way that I was not having this baby before March 15 as that would have meant I was in labour for three days.\n\n\u201cI was 12 days overdue and thought they would help me have my baby.\n\n\u201cI trusted the doctors 100 per cent so I accepted what they said. Even so, I felt something wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nThe following day the contractions got worse so Stela and her husband, George, again returned to the hospital.\n\nShe said: \u201cI got checked over by a young midwife and at this stage I felt like was ready to give birth and didn\u2019t want to go home.\n\n\"My contractions were really strong but she said they weren\u2019t frequent enough. If I had told them that I was having them more evenly spaced than maybe they would have let me stay.\n\n\u201cI pointed out that I was supposed to be induced the day before, but she was only concerned about how spaced out my contractions were.\n\n\u201cI asked if there was any risk to the baby as he was overdue and she said \u2018it\u2019s 100 per cent fine, nothing is going to happen and everything is going to be okay\u2019 and sent me home with some co-codamol.\u201d\n\nLater that evening Stela went in for the third time to be told that her baby\u2019s heart was no longer beating.\n\n\u201cWhen the doctor came she asked when my waters broke and I said I didn\u2019t notice that they had.\u201d Stela said.\n\n\u201cI said I had been in twice and it hadn\u2019t been mentioned to me. She said that she was really sorry, but there wasn\u2019t enough water and that my baby was not there any more.\n\n\u201cI started screaming and crying, saying that that wasn\u2019t possible. I was asking if there was any way that they could perform a C-section on me to see if he was still alive as maybe his heart had just stopped.\n\n\u201cThe doctor said she was sorry but the baby was no longer there and immediately left the room.\u201d\n\nStela, who is originally from Cahul in Moldova but has lived in the UK for 10 years, then had to give birth to her lifeless son.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey handed his little body to me and I was glad to be able to hold my little Lucas. I kept him in a cot next to me until the morning.\"\n\nDiane Sarkar, Chief Nursing Officer for Mid and South Essex University Hospital Group, said: \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to Stela Ernu and the family of Baby Ernu at this extremely difficult time. A full investigation is currently being conducted externally to the Trust by the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB).\n\n\u201cWe do not have the report at this time and cannot comment further until this investigation has been completed.\u201d\n\nStephanie Prior, Head of Clinical Negligence at London law firm Osbornes Law, is representing Stela.\n\nShe is also representing a man who was widowed when his wife died at the same hospital during childbirth.\n\nStephanie said: \u201cThis is a tragic case of a young mum who had no complications throughout her pregnancy, but then suffered the devastation of having her son stillborn.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first case we have seen at the unit and we are concerned that there may be a pattern developing of patients whose first language is not English who have not received the best possible care.\n\n\u201cMs Ernu is desperate for answers about why she lost her son and we would urge those conducting the investigation to publish their findings as soon as possible.\u201d", "description": "Stela Ernu gave birth to her lifeless son Lucas and said it was the most horrific thing that has ever happened to her", "authors": ["Alasdair Hooper", "Image", "Essex Live Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561389.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Stela-Ernu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
