League of Women Voters when it summarily dismissed a lower court ruling that the Michigan Legislature had violated the Constitution when it drew congressional and state legislative districts that the league and individual Democratic voters claimed favored the Republican Party.\n\nThe lower court ruling contravened the Supreme Court\u2019s commonsense decision in June in Rucho v. Common Cause that partisan redistricting is a political question beyond the reach of the federal courts.\n\nAs Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out in Rucho, there are no manageable legal standards that courts can apply. Partisan redistricting is \u201cnothing new,\u201d and neither is \u201cfrustration with it.\u201d It was known \u201cin the colonies prior to independence and the framers were familiar with it at the time of the drafting and ratification of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nYet the drafters of the Constitution still gave state legislature the authority to draw political boundaries, and did not give the courts any power to supervise this process. Politics will always play a role in redistricting. The question is: At what point do political considerations move from unacceptable to unconstitutional? There is no way to make such a determination.\n\nIn any event, the heart of the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge in the Michigan case, as the Supreme Court said in Rucho, was based on a \u201cdesire for proportional representation\u201d for political parties. In other words, they were arguing that if, for example, the Democratic candidate for statewide office gets 60% of the vote, then the party is entitled to 60% of the congressional and state legislative seats in that state.\n\nThat is an absurd notion. The Constitution does not guarantee proportional representation to political parties, and there is no historical basis whatsoever for claiming that the framers of the Constitution thought that proportional representation was required. As the Supreme Court said in Rucho, there is no way for a judge to determine what is the \u201cappropriate\u201d share of \u201csafe\u201d seats for political parties, and there are no \u201cprecise standards that are clear, manageable, and politically neutral.\u201d\n\nWhat was so odd about the Michigan lawsuit was that the redistricting plan in question went into effect in 2011, yet the league didn\u2019t file its lawsuit until more than six years later \u2014 that's three election cycles.\n\nEqually puzzling was why the lower court allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Apparently, the court accepted the bizarre notion that voters who couldn\u2019t show any concrete, tangible injury still had standing to file a lawsuit simply because they felt \u201cfrustrated,\u201d \u201cless enthusiastic\u201d about voting, or that their representative was \u201cless responsive\u201d to their concerns. That is the sort of generalized grievance that the federal courts have never considered sufficient to establish standing.\n\nIn addition to the fact that the Constitution doesn\u2019t guarantee proportional representation to political parties, the claims about \u201cpartisan\u201d redistricting ignore political geography. Many residents of Michigan live in areas that tend to vote overwhelmingly for Republican or Democratic candidates. No matter how neutral and nonpartisan you are in drawing maps, voters in those areas are going to be placed in districts that overwhelmingly vote for candidates of one party.\n\nPartisan redistricting is often frustrating. But engaging in politics doesn\u2019t violate the U.S. Constitution. Moreover, this is not a problem that can be, or should be, remedied by unelected federal judges who, unlike state legislators, are not accountable to voters for what they do. This is an issue to be resolved through the democratic process, including the implementation of better standards governing the drawing of political boundary lines.", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court got it exactly right this past week in Chatfield v.
