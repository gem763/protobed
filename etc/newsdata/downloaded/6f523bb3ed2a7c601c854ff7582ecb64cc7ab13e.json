Now we have better information an informed choice can be made. I\u2019ve been here 20 years and my husband and children are English so I love this country and have no intention to leave. But I\u2019m worried \u2013 not just about my rights, but about the mood in the country. We\u2019re polarised and people are scared to discuss it with the other side. Just saying: \u201cAren\u2019t the other side rubbish!\u201d isn\u2019t good enough. The mood now is that you\u2019re a traitor if you speak to the other side. The base of democracy is dialogue and we need to get to the issues below why Brexit happened. For me it\u2019s not a contradiction between being European and being German or being in this country and loving it and feeling British. That\u2019s all in my person.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Annisha Jhatakia, 24. Will her dream job with the EU be possible?

My dream job was working for the EU but I don\u2019t know if that will be at all possible. But it\u2019s awful for people in all sorts of industries who just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve got family and friends who are pro-Brexit \u2013 I come from Manchester and many northern towns feel detached from Westminster; so for many people the Brexit vote was an opportunity to protest about the British government, not the EU. But the more money they put into Brexit, the less they can put into the NHS and the benefits system. The march today has a very positive atmosphere - so many different ages and walks of life, all coming together to protest against something they agree is bad for the country. No one is here for themselves, they\u2019re here for everyone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin Tedd, 61. \u2018Better off in than out.\u2019 Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nMartin Tedd, 61\n\nfrom Birmingham, retired owner of a software company\n\nI\u2019m here because I believe we are far better off in than out. Economically, it\u2019s well proved in every independent analysis. And we were fooled in the last referendum. We were fooled by people like Farage and Johnson and the populist politicians who seem to be holding sway in Britain and Europe and America. They\u2019ve offered simple solutions to complex problems. These people gain their strength from saying whatever they think will be popular \u2013 they don\u2019t even care if people find them out. There were so many poor arguments in the last referendum which were about identity politics and about immigration, that were basically untrue. Well, now it\u2019s time to have a second ballot on what has been decided - because it\u2019s very, very different from what was promised. So I\u2019m marching today because I hope there will be a people\u2019s vote. Am I optimistic? No.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Campbell, 37. \u2018A real shame and a waste.\u2019 Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nChristopher Campbell, 37\n\nfrom Macclesfield, data scientist\n\nThe way the Brexit movement has grown from internal Tory politics to a national issue is a real shame and a waste. The people who really want Brexit are doing it because of an emotional response, rather than being able to see the full impact on their own communities. If they get what they want, I think they\u2019ll be utterly shocked and horrified by the damage they\u2019ve done. As a data scientist it interests me that the way the Brexit debate is being conducted is not about facts, it\u2019s about emotions because the issue is too complex to fully break down. Leavers are being pulled by Brexit-pushing newspapers which make them feel Brexit is something they should be thinking about, and deflecting them away from the real issues. All my life I\u2019ve ignored that type of newspaper and thought: \u201cIt\u2019s just words.\u201d But it turns out that words matter.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andrew Lee, 35. A second referendum can break the deadlock. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nAndrew Lee, 35\n\nfrom Toronto, lives in London, works in finance\n\nI have dual British-Canadian citizenship. I feel a second referendum is the only way to get out of the deadlock, irrespective of one\u2019s preference for leave or remain because we need a steer from the people, now that three years have passed and the goalposts have moved. People think differently now, after being misled in 2016, and we should have the opportunity to say: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do this any more. We don\u2019t want to compound our errors.\u201d You only need to look at what\u2019s happened to the pound to see how much faith people have that the current administration can negotiate a better trade deal than what we\u2019ve got. Fundamentally, the question is: What is the path forward for this country and this people? And the three administrations in the last three years have been unable to pull us out of this quagmire.", "description": "Protesters explain why they want a second referendum on EU membership", "authors": ["Gareth Rubin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629796f5d7705604856262bd42cbc9c73d13bf96/0_351_4643_2785/master/4643.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ba496f40965ef42216d9eb7fc71d3fc3", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
