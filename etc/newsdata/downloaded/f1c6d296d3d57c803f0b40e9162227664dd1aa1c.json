Equally painful was the stunt played by 30 belligerent members of the House, who marched into a committee hearing in violation of rules promulgated in 2015 by a Republican majority.\n\nAnd it\u2019s getting worse. Here are two recent, and especially egregious examples:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPressed by CNN reporter Manu Raju about whether it was appropriate for President Trump Donald John TrumpNumber of uninsured children rises for second year, tops 4 million Trump moment from White House Halloween trick-or-treat event goes viral White House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report MORE to ask Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly-elected president of Ukraine, to investigate Joe Biden Joe BidenWhite House official says transcript of Ukraine call omitted key phrases: report Biden uses National Cat Day to fundraise for putting a 'pet back in White House' Sondland emerges as key target after Vindman testimony MORE and Hunter Biden in exchange for the release of a military aid package passed by Congress, Rep.

MORE (R-Nev.), who had expressed support for an impeachment inquiry \u2014 and then walked it back \u2014 wondered why the Democrats had no plans to call the whistleblower to testify. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question\u2026,\u201d Raju responded. Amodei shot back: \u201cI disagree with your conclusion. It\u2019s a conclusion, not a question.\u201d Raju tried again: \u201cIs it okay for the president to ask a foreign country to investigate the Bidens?\u201d Amodei repeated his non sequitur: \u201cThat\u2019s not a question,\u201d adding, \u201cIf you want to interview yourself, go ahead.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, with the release of the opening statement of Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on Trump\u2019s National Security Council, to the House Intelligence Committee, in which he declared that he \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s bi-partisan support of Ukraine,\u201d former Congressman Sean Duffy Sean Duffy MSNBC's Wallace calls out 'chickens--t' Trump allies for attacks on Vindman Trump attacks on Vindman trigger backlash CNN anchor blasts contributor Sean Duffy over 'anti-immigrant bigotry' MORE (R-Wis.) joined Fox & Friends Trumpers in trashing the foreign service officer (and lieutenant colonel in the Army), who fled Ukraine with his father and twin brother when he was 3 years old, served several overseas tours as a U.S. infantry officer, and received a Purple Heart after he was wounded in Iraq: \u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d Duffy proclaimed. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy\u2026 We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from\u2026 He has an affinity for the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAlas, it may not be true that Republicans have nowhere to go but up.\n\nFollowing the House vote to lay out impeachment procedures on Thursday, Republican members of Congress \u2014 to say nothing of American voters \u2014 may find process arguments less compelling. In any event, President Trump has suggested they \u201cgo into the details of the case rather than process. Process is good, but I think you ought to look at the case.\u201d\n\nIf they do, one wonders, will they acknowledge, at least tacitly, that the evidence of a quid pro quo is overwhelming?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf past is prologue, Republicans may well double-down on the lousy hand their president has dealt them.\n\nThat said, Republican members of Congress whose re-election is in doubt, I suspect, will join the growing number of their colleagues who have announced their retirement and choose the only plausible strategy left to them.\n\nWhat the president did was wrong, they will say, probably softly and off-camera, and then declare that the offense is not impeachable. In any event, they will add, the voters should decide whether Donald Trump should have a second term.\n\nThe rest will keep their fingers crossed and hope against hope that more shoes \u2014 or even heavier objects \u2014 don\u2019t drop before November.\n\nGlenn C.
