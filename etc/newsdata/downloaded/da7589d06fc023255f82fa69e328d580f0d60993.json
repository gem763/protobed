It was then picked up by Maurice 'Mo Robinson' who has since been arrested in connection with the investigation.\n\nIn order to pass through the port (above) hauliers need to produce a waybill on arrival\n\nAccording to The Times, police are now focusing their attentions on the driver who delivered the container to the Belgium port and the CCTV footage may be able to identify them.\n\nDutch language newspaper Het Nieuwsblad quoted one source, thought to have been a Belgium official as saying: 'We hope to catch him soon. His truck was filmed ten times at the port site'.\n\nThe driver who delivered the unit is thought to have dismissed normal protocol and failed to identify himself, or provide a waybill upon arrival at the port.\n\nA waybill is a document obtained by hauliers which shows their contract with the shipping firm they have an agreement with.\n\nThe revelation raises security questions about ports across Europe. Zeebrugge is pictured above)\n\nThe migrants are have believed to have started their journey in China before making their way to Europe\n\nIt raises questions about the security of ports across Europe, as the UK are believed to have sent equipment to terminals such as Zeebrugge in order to thwart people smuggling.\n\nSpeaking last night a Belgian police officer said there were 4,000 lorries and containers that go through Zeebrugge every day without being seen on camera, and claimed that migrants placed in containers regularly got through to the UK.\n\nHe added that smugglers put migrants in lorries in places such as Germany and Luxembourg before getting them across to the UK.\n\nIn response to this Zeebrugge port said that it had put sniffer dogs and detection devices in place to spot body heat on lorry trailers, however they claimed that this did not work on refrigerated units.\n\nThe units are thought to undergo a 'camera check' by guards to see if plastic seals have been broken, if this is the case, officers are then alerted.\n\nCommenting on the developments, Belgian politician Franky Demon told The Times that the question for officials in Belgiam is whether or not the country is lagging behind in terms of technology.\n\n'Have they found a back door for their smuggling with transport via refrigerated containers?'\n\nThis latest development comes as a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nThis brings the charge list to four, after Warrington couple Joanna Maher and her husband Thomas have been held on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of 39 counts of manslaughter.\n\nPolice were given an extra 24 hours to to question Mo Robinson (left and right) after he was arrested on suspicion of murder\n\nLorry driver Maurice 'Mo' Robinson was also charged on suspicion of murder and police were also given extra time to quiz the 25-year-old.\n\nOn Friday it was also revealed that six of the possible victims may have been Vietnamese.\n\nA woman named Pham Thi Tra My had text her family as she died on the container, messaging her mother and telling her she couldn't breathe.\n\nThis is while the family of a 20-year-old man named Nguyen Dinh Luong, who was travelling from Vietnam to France, has also not been heard from in days.", "description": "Cameras at the port terminal in Belgium snapped the vehicle as it went through the security port terminal, carrying 31 men and eight women.", "authors": ["Terri-Ann Williams For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/01/20203162-0-image-a-2_1572049652265.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
