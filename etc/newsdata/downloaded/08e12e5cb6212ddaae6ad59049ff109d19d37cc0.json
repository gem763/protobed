It is unfair to our country.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What happens if Mexico doesn't stem the migrant flow?\n\nMr Trump has not yet responded to the latest figures released by the Mexican government, but earlier this week praised their efforts.\n\n\"I want to thank Mexico, the Mexican government, their great President of Mexico, for helping us,\" he told reporters on Wednesday. \"They're helping us in a very big way. Far bigger than anybody thought even possible.\"\n\nMr Trump has made a crackdown on illegal migration a key priority of his presidency since his 2016 election campaign.\n\nHis stance has led to frequent run-ins with Democrats in Congress, with particular flashpoints including the conditions within migrant detention facilities and funding for the president's long-promised border wall.\n\nIn February, Mr Trump declared an emergency on the US-Mexico border to free up federal funding.", "description": "The foreign minister says the number of arrivals on the US border has fallen since May.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10B02/production/_108645386_e86c4d26-49a0-416a-8294-076517b4df53.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
