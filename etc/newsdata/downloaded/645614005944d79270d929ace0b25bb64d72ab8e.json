He says one thing, while earth across the Balkans gives up its mass graves. While Handke proffers his views, the bones are facts.\n\nDoes this matter? Literature must exist independent of politics; the Nobel prize could be awarded regardless of morals or ideology. But that\u2019s not what the prize sets out to be or do. It is awarded, according to the will of Alfred Nobel, for outstanding work \u201cen idealisk riktning\u201d \u2013 in an ideal direction or direction of an ideal.\n\nThe prize does have moral, as well as literary, pretensions: Seamus Heaney won it in 1995 for work of \u201clyrical beauty and ethical depth\u201d. Ezra Pound was among the greatest poets of the past century, but never won the prize, possibly because of his fascism and hideous antisemitism.\n\nHandke was not just expressing his opinion in his book A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia and his homily at Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s funeral \u2013 he went out of his way to give credence to mass murder and, in this context, as importantly, to lies. He offered to testify for Milo\u0161evi\u0107 at The Hague; had he done so, we might have met \u2013 on opposite sides. The thing about our reporting in Bosnia is that, as another controversial Nobel laureate (for peace, in 1973) Henry Kissinger said: \u201cIt has the added virtue of being true.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest International criminal tribunal investigators at a mass grave near the village of Pilica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 1996, a year after the Srebrenica massacre.

Handke\u2019s equation of Srebrenica with lesser outrages by the Bosnian army is like Donald Trump blaming \u201call sides\u201d for Charlottesville and finding \u201cvery fine people\u201d among the neo-Nazis. In fact, the current political zeitgeist of refusal to live with \u201cthe other\u201d can be seen to have roots in the post-Yugoslav carnage.\n\nThere\u2019s something weird about Bosnia: why doesn\u2019t it matter to a public figure\u2019s life that they endorsed or denied the slaughter? Harold Pinter won the Nobel in 2005 having joined the \u201cFree Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u201d campaign. Noam Chomsky is revered, for all his swerving and equivocating over the camps and Srebrenica. I wonder whether these people, like Handke, consider their searing impact on survivors and bereaved. When I asked Dr Idriz Merd\u017eani\u0107, who tried to tend to tortured men and violated women in Trnopolje camp about the deniers, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to find words to describe the camps and what happened to us, but I have no words to describe what these people do.\u201d\n\nAnyone concerned with preserving some narrative in accordance with what happened in Bosnia can only react to this award with bitter exhaustion, a sense that those efforts were in vain.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my understanding of journalism is that you walk a straight line and report what\u2019s true. This turns out to be not especially lucrative and harder than it should be. Literature operates to other standards \u2013 as it should \u2013 yet this outrage from the ivory tower proceeds from obfuscation to rewriting history. They won, we lost; lies won, truth lost.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point? Why bother? Against Handke, I\u2019ll pitch the writer whose place on the podium in Stockholm in 1957 he stains: Albert Camus.\n\nCamus\u2019s magnificent acceptance speech was about how the duty of a writer is to do more than write, but also testify to truth. Ten years earlier, Camus published his masterpiece La peste, whose hero, Dr Rieux, adheres to a complex notion of pointless endeavour: one fights to save the life of an infected child although it is doomed \u2013 fight the plague, because that\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nAlthough, in this value-free present, to cite Handke\u2019s predecessor of 2016, Bob Dylan: \u201cAt times I think there are no words/ But these to say what\u2019s true./ And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden.\u201d\n\n\u2022Ed Vulliamy reported on the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s", "description": "Whatever his literary merits, Peter Handke\u2019s dismal morals should have disqualified him", "authors": ["Ed Vulliamy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26490ff3abb97fc317cc66b99c2c7a0336b3b0fb/101_106_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5c20e5958a7b2091b403ad5b4908b4d2", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
