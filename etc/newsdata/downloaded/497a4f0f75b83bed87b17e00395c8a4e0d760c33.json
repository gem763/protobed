Trump via Twitter on Tuesday for the president's use of the word \"lynching\" to describe the current impeachment inquiry into his administration. However, the only problem with Biden's newfound admonishment is that roughly 21 years ago, he used the very same phrase to describe the impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!\" President Trump tweeted.\n\nSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\n\"Impeachment is not 'lynching,' it is part of our Constitution. Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable,\" Biden responded.\n\nImpeachment is not \"lynching,\" it is part of our Constitution.

(emphasis added).\n\nWhile Biden has called Trump\u2019s lynching comments \u201cabhorrent\u201d and \u201cdespicable,\u201d in 1998 appearance on CNN, Biden said impeachment could end up being viewed as a \u201cpartisan lynching.\u201d https://t.co/4jGo8hSQSZhttps://t.co/6p210g7M6l pic.twitter.com/UkJiXLsHOG \u2014 andrew kaczynski??

However, as pointed out Turning Point USA, a slew of Democrats used some variant of this term during the Clinton era.\n\n\u201cIndeed it is a Political Lynching\u201d pic.twitter.com/tNSnYDcLHW \u2014 ALX ???? ??
