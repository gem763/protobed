It turns out that Zane, the Operative, is kind of a lousy performer when it comes to surviving Borderlands 3\u2019s toughest post-game challenges. These problems don\u2019t become clear until you reach the endgame, and by then, it\u2019s already too late.\n\nNearly two weeks after Borderlands 3 was released, many players are deep into the endgame, and some of them have been a bit frustrated by Zane\u2019s high-level play. While he\u2019s far from unuseable, his shortcomings have already become a bit of a meme, with players posting at length about how he seems to stack up poorly compared to the other three Vault Hunters.\n\nGranted, the game is two weeks old, and not everything is going to be perfectly balanced to everyone\u2019s satisfaction. Still, Zane is an interesting case.\n\nA lot of what players say makes Zane a subpar choice in the endgame are, unfortunately, the same things that make him so interesting in an initial playthrough. He\u2019s the only character who can equip two action skills at once, and each of the three skills he can choose from seem pretty useful, at least in the first go-round. There\u2019s a barrier he can deploy for cover (that can be upgraded to become a dome and buff allies), a drone, and a Digi-Clone decoy that fires at enemies and can also switch places with Zane at the press of a button.\n\nThis assortment of skills makes Zane a good choice for a tactically-minded player. The problem is that Borderlands 3 isn\u2019t much of tactically-minded game, and the other three characters have an assortment of skills more inclined to dealing a lot of damage in very little time. This means Zane is both an oddball better suited for an entirely different game and, long-term, a liability with no real power-play to deal heavy damage to a boss or save their teammates from a mob of enemies.\n\nIntrepid Borderlands 3 players are finding ways to make Zane work despite his skillset. YouTuber RyanCentral has a great build that emphasises speed and kills, one that Forbes\u2019 Paul Tassi has also replicated with success. There are also build guides on RockPaperShotgun that take advantage of the character\u2019s versatility. Zane isn\u2019t a lost cause.\n\nThe problem is that other characters have builds that are so good it feels like cheating, which is the platonic ideal of a Borderlands character. Right now, one of the most popular builds in the game centres on FL4K, the robot beastmaster, and exploiting their skill trees\u2019 various ways to multiply the amount of critical damage dealt. Seeing it in action is truly insane.\n\nBorderlands 3 does not make it that easy to change characters. You\u2019re pretty much locked into your choice for the additional modes following the main campaign, which are new game plus (dubbed True Vault Hunter Mode) or Mayhem mode, the latter of which offers three tiers of increased difficulty for running bosses and sidequests post-game.\n\nYou could start up another character in True Vault Hunter Mode and level them faster with the increased rewards doled out, but you\u2019re still starting from level 1. Also, starting a True Vault Hunter run with whatever character you beat the campaign with lets you skip the slow tutorial mission while letting you keep your skills, gear, and current level. So why can\u2019t I just roll a new level 30 character for my second playthrough? (This is the same thing previous Borderlands games did; it\u2019s just too bad that the latest instalment hasn\u2019t improved on this.)\n\nAs someone who chose Zane as my main, I\u2019m feeling a little burned. I\u2019m pretty interested in the the game\u2019s wealth of endgame content and extensive post-release plans. Tonal issues aside, it\u2019s nice to play a loot shooter that feels like it\u2019s completely busted in your favour.\n\nPlaying as Zane doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to give me that experience, though. I\u2019m not levelled high enough to have anything close to a good endgame build for him yet, but I\u2019m already starting to feel the pinch. Zane just isn\u2019t good at surviving, or dealing enough high-impact damage to make boss fights feel like less of a gruelling experience. I want to feel like a superhero, but mostly I feel like a chump.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping Borderlands 3 gets something akin to Diablo 3\u2019s Adventure Mode, where you can just roll a character and run whatever challenges you want. In the meantime, I guess I\u2019ll try my hand at playing as Amara, all the way back at level 1.", "description": "Some Borderlands 3 players believe that one member of the game\u2019s roster of four playable characters is a bit of a lemon.
