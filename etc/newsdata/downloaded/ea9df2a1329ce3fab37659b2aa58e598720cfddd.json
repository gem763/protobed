I don\u2019t feel satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThe international recognition of the killings as genocide has long been the top priority of Yerevan\u2019s foreign policy, supported by vigorous campaigning by the influential Armenian diasporas across the world.\n\nArmenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart.\n\nTurkey fiercely rejects the genocide label, arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers and sided with invading Russian troops.\n\nBy passing the resolution, US lawmakers have delivered a two-punch rebuke to Turkey on its national day.\n\nThe measure passed alongside a bill that imposes sanctions over Ankara\u2019s assault on Kurdish-controlled territory in northeastern Syria that was made possible by the withdrawal of American troops.", "description": "Yerevan (AFP) \u2013 Armenians on Wednesday rejoiced over the historic vote in the US House of Representatives that recognised as \u201cgenocide\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/7e21a9_hilltop-genocide-memorial-dominates-yerevan-skyline-draws-hundreds-thousands-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
