In the end, it finished higher by 0.41% to 3022.55, or a little more than 3 points away from history.\n\n\n\nThe leader of the day and the week, though, was the NASDAQ. Bolstered by a strong session for Intel (NASDAQ: ), it jumped 0.70% (or 57 points) to 8243.12.\n\n\n\nThe tech-laden index now has a four-week winning streak, while the S&P has a three-week run. These indices have gained over the past three consecutive days as well.\n\n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the , which had to grapple with Boeing (NYSE: ), 3M (NYSE: ) and the overall concern of softening global growth. The index still rose 0.57% (or around 150 points) to 26,958.06. And in what may be the most impressive result considering all the challenges, it advanced 0.7% for the week.\n\n\n\nIntel provided a nice lift for the market on Friday by soaring more than 8% after last night\u2019s strong quarterly result, which included a better-than-expected fourth-quarter guidance.\n\n\n\nAnd its worth noting that Amazon (NASDAQ: ) was only down a little more than 1% today, marking an impressive recovery from this morning in the wake of yesterday\u2019s quarterly report that the market found disappointing.\n\n\n\nWe also enjoyed some good news on the trade situation, as the U.S. and China continue to talk and deliberate. They appear to be making progress in agreeing on the \u201cphase one\u201d of their deal. Fingers crossed\u2026\n\n\n\nA strong earnings season and some real progress on trade would be a great way to close out 2019 as we enter the final two months.\n\n\n\nWow\u2026 that was a busy week, but it was only an appetizer for what\u2019s to come!\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re still in the middle of earnings season so they\u2019ll be plenty more reports coming, including the rest of the FAANGs. Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) is scheduled for Monday, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) are coming on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nBut on top of all the earnings, next week also includes a Fed meeting. And guess what? The market is expecting another rate cut, which pretty much means it\u2019s demanding one.\n\n\n\nFortunately, we have this weekend to relax and look forward (hopefully) to some new highs on the horizon\u2026\n\n\n\nToday's Portfolio Highlights:\n\n\n\nValue Investor: The machinery industry has really been crushed by global recession fears. For example, industrial manufacturer Manitowoc (MTW) has lost 68% in the past 2 years! However, many analysts are coming around to the idea that the bottom has either been reached or is close. Tracey agrees, which is why she added MTW on Friday. In addition to its value characteristics, MTW is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings expected to climb to $1.70 this year from 64 cents. The last time this maker of cranes and hydraulic boom trucks was this low, it rallied hard after hitting bottom. The editor hopes she\u2019s getting in just in time for the next uptrend. The stock reports again after the bell on Nov 7. Read the full write-up for more.\n\n\n\nETF Investor: What do you do if you\u2019re bullish about the aerospace & defense industry amid this Boeing debacle? Well the first thing Neena did was sell the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) while she could still make a 6.5% return. This fund\u2019s biggest holding is Boeing, which makes up about 21% of the portfolio. The editor replaced the name by adding SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSE: ). The troubled airplane giant only makes up 3.8% of this fund! XAR has outperformed the S&P this year by gaining 34% and is slightly cheaper than what its replacing. Read the full write-up for more on today\u2019s changes.\n\n\n\nHealthcare Innovators: In one of those unpredictable things about earnings season, shares of Illumina (NASDAQ: ) plunged despite a strong quarterly report with better-than-expected earnings and sales. Apparently, the market is concerned about slowing growth and the UK possibly blocking an acquisition. Kevin sees the move as an overreaction and a great opportunity. He\u2019s starting with a smaller position in ILMN because this life sciences company might continue slipping to around $250, which would be a good time to add more. So be patient and make sure to read his complete commentary for all the specifics.\n\n\n\nSurprise Trader: With the semiconductor industry in the Top 30% of the Zacks Industry Rank, Dave ended this week\u2019s buying spree by adding Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) with a 12.5% allocation. This chip stock has met or beaten earnings for eight consecutive quarters, and seems set to do it again. It has an impressive Earnings ESP of 9.04% for the quarter coming after the bell on Tuesday, October 29. The editor also got out of the underperforming Hawaiian Holdings (HA) position.
