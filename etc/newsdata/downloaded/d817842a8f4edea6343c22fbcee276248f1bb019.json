Boyertown Area School District, a case concerning a gender identity bathroom and locker room policy at a Pennsylvania high school.\n\nIn declining to take up the case, The Supreme Court let stand the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\u2019s decision, which dismissed the concerns of students who did not wish to share intimate spaces with members of the opposite sex.\n\nAs long as this policy remains in place, the problems with the policy remain too. High school girls like Alexis Lightcap will continue to have to share women\u2019s spaces with biological males.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a man in the bathroom with me. I\u2019m already uncomfortable in my body, trying to grow up,\u201d said Lightcap. \u201cI have a thirteen-year-old sister who goes to this school. I don\u2019t want her going into a bathroom where a male is allowed to just walk in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish that the school had protected my privacy somehow. It felt like a specific group of people were protected while the greater population was not,\u201d Lightcap said.\n\nPolicies like the one at Boyertown Area School District leaves girls vulnerable to emotional trauma\u2013or worse. At a school in Decatur, Georgia, a gender identity bathroom policy similar to the one at Boyertown enabled a boy who identifies as gender fluid to sexually assault a kindergarten girl.\n\nGirls deserve to feel safe and have privacy in women\u2019s only spaces.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood this. When she penned the majority opinion requiring Virginia Military Institute to admit women, she stipulated that VMI would need to \u201cafford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.\u201d\n\nWhy? As she wrote in an op-ed at The Washington Post while she was a law professor at Columbia, \u201cSeparate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy. Individual privacy, a right of constitutional dimension, is appropriately harmonized with the equality principle.\u201d\n\nPrivacy and equality are not mutually exclusive. In fact, upholding the former is essential to preserving the latter\u2014especially for women.\n\nThe #MeToo movement is a prescient reminder that women still face unique social challenges. Taking away women\u2019s privacy from the male form and the male gaze directly by forcing them to share spaces with males is a step backwards in the fight for equality.\n\nThis problem is not going anywhere. As Ginsburg pointed out in her VMI opinion, \u201c[p]hysical differences between the sexes are enduring,\u201d and quoting Ballard v. United States, \u201c[t]he two sexes are not fungible.\u201d\n\nThe difference between the sexes is here to stay; so too are the problems with gender identity policies like the one at Boyertown.\n\nEveryone deserves privacy and safety in private facilities. However, one-size-fits-all policies like Boyertown\u2019s fail to take into account the very real needs of countless girls.\n\nBetter solutions exist. In the absence of a Supreme Court decision, it is on school administrators to find them.", "description": "The Supreme Court rejected a case regarding school policy in a district which allows transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court denied cert to Doe v.
