The US was in the midst of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nBut the overarching macroeconomic environment couldn't suppress Old West's growth.\n\nOver the course of the next five years, the operation swelled in size, with the $15 million in firmwide assets Boskovich started with originally ballooning to $200 million during the period.\n\nBoskovich attributes much of that explosive growth to the firm's stock picking strategy \u2014 one he describes as a management-focused, value-based, growth-in-disguise approach.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Boskovich outlined the three core tenets of his firm's stock-selecting principles in detail:\n\n(1) Skin in the game\n\n\"As a first principle, we believe that the surest way to protect our capital \u2014 and grow our capital \u2014 is by aligning ourselves with management teams who have high stock ownership and smart pay,\" he said. \"We really just want to invest with management teams that have more to gain or lose through their equity ownership than they do through their compensation.\"\n\nTo meet this criteria, Boskovich prefers management with a high level of skin in the game. That means 30%, 40%, or even 50% ownership in the company. This ensures that the company's leadership is making capital allocations that are most consistent with growing shareholder value. An alignment of these views is something that Boskovich views as absolutely critical to investment selection.\n\nIf management isn't exposed to the same risks as shareholders, he immediately eliminates the firm from consideration.\n\n(2) Reasonable prices\n\nBoskovich is quick to note that he's not ready to pull the trigger on an investment just because a company looks cheap. To him, companies that are priced at a discount are that way for a reason \u2014 and they're not going to appreciate in future just because they've been beat up in the past.\n\n\"We want to just make sure that we're buying into these businesses at prices that make sense to use,\" he said. \"I think at the end of the day, the most important metric might be: How much cash does this company generate? Because that ultimately should find its way to the shareholders.\"\n\nIn addition to cash generation, Boskovich also looks to identify catalysts that will unlock value going forward. This includes: shifts in management and strategy, new products, and potential acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nWithout the potential for a spark, a cheap valuation seems warranted \u2014 and the company will be shunned from selection.\n\n(3) Breakout businesses\n\nThis is one of Boskovich's favorite criteria for stock selection: identifying a growing business in disguise. It requires a deeper dive into a company, but the payoffs can be immense if correctly pinpointed.\n\nHe shares an example of a current holding \u2014 one he considers a breakout business. He argues that it will yield large returns by the time it's fully matured.\n\n\"IDW media is a publishing business, and people are assigning the appropriate valuation to this kind of mature, stable, not-really-growing publishing business,\" he said. \"But they have this breakout business that's coming up, and people aren't necessarily assigning a lot of weight to it in IDW entrainment.\"\n\nHe continued: \"That entertainment division is kind of a breakout business, and company revenue should double in the next 12 months because of that breakout business.\"\n\nOn the outside, IDW media may look like a maturing holding. However, a deeper dive reveals untapped value.\n\nThis is why it's so crucial to read through a company's financials and pinpoint where growth is emanating from. A face-value analysis of IDW media wouldn't reveal its underlying potential.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Boskovich is eager to share a budding opportunity he sees in today's marketplace.\n\n\"We have a huge exposure to uranium,\" he said.\n\nHis thesis is simple, and it comes down to the two most-basic laws of economics: supply and demand.\n\n\"In the last few years, over 25 million pounds of uranium supply have come off the market \u2014 and that equates to about 20% of global mined supply,\" he said. \"To put that into perspective, that would be the equivalent of Saudi Arabia and Russia saying 'Hey, we're completely seizing production of oil.'\"\n\nBut that's only one side of the equation, and Boskovich sees demand throughout the globe heating up as countries look for greener sources of energy.\n\n\"Right now, there are 450 operating nuclear reactors worldwide \u2014 and there's about 60 nuclear reactors under construction, 120 that are planned, and roughly another 350 that are being proposed.\"\n\nIt's this imbalance that has Boskovich so bullish on the future price of the chemical element.\n\nIn order to take advantage of this massive disparity between supply and demand, Boskovich owns a basket of uranium miners, which is one of the largest positions in his portfolio.\n\nAn investor looking to invest in uranium could purchase the Global X Uranium ETF (URA).\n\n\"If you study the dynamics in that space, I think it's maybe a once in a lifetime investment opportunity,\" he concluded.", "description": "It's been years in the making, but Joseph Boskovich has his sights set on a thematic investment opportunity that looks primed to deliver.", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db72e46dee01917ef6ae403?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
