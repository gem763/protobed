But investors are hoping hedge-fund managers trust their process and stick to their strategies.\n\nA crash in high-flying growth stocks last week smacked momentum-tracking hedge funds, with one US pension seeing its trend-following funds surrender their August gains in a couple days. And a huge spike in crude-oil prices this week hit many funds with bearish views on the commodity.\n\nThe best thing whiplashed hedge funds can do right now is stay the course, Jon Aikman, a finance professor at the University of Toronto, said. He sits on the school's endowment and pension-investment committees, which allocate more than $5 billion.\n\nHe wants hedge-fund managers to \"stick to their guns and continue what they are doing.\"\n\n\"If they see dislocation they can take advantage of, go for it, but I don't want to see a big sell-off,\" Aikman told Business Insider. \"If they're just going to sell out, I can get an ETF to do that.\"\n\nRead more: Hedge funds are getting whacked in an 'unheard of' stock-market shift \u2014 and a leaked Morgan Stanley memo warns of possible pain for months\n\nIn an email, David Bahnsen, a wealth manager at Bahnsen Group who manages more than $1 billion, said \"in times like this, and any other time, our objective with hedge funds is, always and forever, non-correlation.\"\n\n\"An absolute return objective is preferred, but we are never looking for our alternative strategies to 'lean into' volatility or momentum, on either side,\" Bahnsen wrote.\n\nLikewise, Darren Wolf, who leads Aberdeen Standard Investments' alternative investment strategies group, said he didn't look for managers that \"try and be heroes\" during times of market stress.\n\n\"We try to find managers that think more strategically about what the moves mean and how it may impact the medium-term outlooks for their strategies,\" Wolf said.\n\nOne hedge-fund manager with total assets in the billions said they tried to explain to investors that drawdowns happen in times like these, adding that \"it's how you react to market dislocation that makes a fund.\"\n\nCautious institutional investors like pensions, endowments, and foundations have already pressed hedge funds to think more long-term. Hedge funds' equity exposure meanwhile is at the lowest level in a decade.\n\nOn the other hand, hedge funds are under pressure to prove their worth to investors who have complained about the industry's high fees. Many managers are seeing opportunities in the fragmented market.\n\nOne hedge fund that focuses on technology stocks was excited for the \"reset\" of the market for growth stocks, which were hit hard during momentum's slide last week.\n\nAnother fund that looks to make money in times of market stress said it usually saw inbounds from potential investors flood in after a serious dislocation.\n\n\"Clients always worry when there are unexpected events and market moves. The question is always \u2014 has it hurt our portfolio? \u2014 fortunately, the answer is no. We're right-sized and we've got hedges in place. We've also been taking advantage of the volatility to add to positions,\" Michael Hintze, the founder and senior investment officer of the $18 billion fund CQS, wrote in an email to Business Insider.\n\nRead more: Hedge funds may be getting slammed (again) after oil's shock surge followed a record shift in equities", "description": "The slide in momentum stocks last week, and oil's spike this weekend, has thrashed hedge funds.
