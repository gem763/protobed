All my friends at school were either Man United fans or Chelsea fans and I didn't want to follow the run of the mill teams.\n\n\"I wanted to have a team that was more mid-table that could give me more emotional rollercoaster moments.\n\n\"Aston Villa's always had a great history. I have got friends of mine who support Aston Villa and one of the first FA Cup games I went to was Bolton v Aston Villa back in 2000. Sadly, Villa went on to lose to Chelsea.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"It was fantastic, I sat with all the fans with my red beanie on, and I was sat with all the Brummie fans and had a great time.\n\n\"It was the atmosphere, the camaraderie and I really felt that there was something I could connect with.\"", "description": "The young prince was delighted to see his side storm into a four-goal lead against Norwich at Carrow Road", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20467854.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DDP_CHP__3117georgeJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
