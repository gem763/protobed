But he turned very quickly.\n\n'If the miles didn't add up on the car he would want to know where I'd been.\n\n'He'd take my car keys so I couldn't take the kids to school or to their dads, I was just stranded.\n\n'He would say things like my friends weren't good for me so I shouldn't see them, he would act like he was saying it for my benefit.\n\n'He put me down a lot, I lost my mum to cancer when I was six and he'd say things like she'd be ashamed of me. That was the hardest thing to hear.'\n\nOver the next three years, the drugs and alcohol counsellor was banned from seeing her friends and family, wasn't allowed to leave the house without permission and Bartrum would even check how many miles she had driven.\n\nAfter the pair moved in together in April 2017, she was banned from seeing her father, 74, and if she arranged to meet up with friends, she felt that she was being watched.\n\nChristopher Bartrum (pictured) quickly became abusive and over the next three years he forced her to transfer him money for no reason and told her she wasn't allowed to leave the house without permission\n\nThe pair moved in together in April 2017 and Gemma eventually called the police in October 2017 when she was threatened in her home while her children, Sofia, eight (pictured with her), and Oscar, five, were asleep upstairs.\n\nWhen Gemma Bush (pictured) tried to escape his clutches, he threatened to call social services and get her children taken away from her or post nude pictures of her online\n\nShe said: 'I was volunteering when I first met him but he made me stop doing that.\n\n'One day, I snuck out for a coffee with my friends and one of his friends saw me and told him.\n\n'I was been watched all the time. I couldn't go anywhere without him finding out.\n\n'My dad had his suspicions. He said to me 'he's got a hold on you but I don't know what it is' and then I was banned from seeing my dad. I didn't speak to him for five to six months.'\n\nWhen Gemma eventually called the police in October, she took her two children, Sophia, eight, and Oscar, five, to stay with her father.\n\nText exchanges between Ms Bush and her ex show him demanding money and threatening her\n\nBartrum was arrested and charged with one count of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship.\n\nThe law defines controlling or coercive behaviour as an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten the victim.\n\nBartrum was sentenced to 22 month sin prison in July this year after being convicted of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship at Norwich Crown Court\n\nMs Bush, who has now moved on with new partner and childhood friend Will, 33, said: 'I knew I was in an abusive relationship for a long time, I was just looking for a safe way out.\n\nShe said: 'As soon as I reported him to the police I called my dad and just said 'daddy' and broke down.\n\n'He came straight away and we went to stay with him. It's been a lot better since he left, we're a lot more settled.\n\n'Christopher wouldn't let me speak to my family but I'm back in touch with them and they've been really supportive.\n\n'However, I have issues. I don't trust anyone. Doctors think I have complex PTSD, I'm having counselling.'\n\nMs Bush is now a domestic abuse champion in her local area, supporting other victims of violence and is speaking out to warn other women.\n\nShe said: 'There is help and support, women say they can't live without all these things, like if they don't have their own money but there's always a way.\n\n'It took me so long. I was trying for years to get away.'", "description": "Gemma Bush, 31, of Norwich, met Christopher Bartrum, 33, in a pub in 2015 and the pair started dating.
