In one interview, she was grilled by New England Cable News host Jim Braude: He wanted to know if she\u2019d support single-payer if she were \u201cthe tsarina\u201d \u2014 in other words, if politics weren\u2019t an obstacle.\n\n\u201cI think right now what we have to do \u2014 I\u2019m serious about this \u2014 I think you\u2019ve got to stay with what\u2019s possible,\u201d Warren said, nodding to the recently passed Affordable Care Act. \u201cAnd I think what we\u2019re doing \u2014 and look at the dust-up around this \u2014 we really need to consolidate our gains around what we\u2019ve got on the table.\u201d\n\nWarren, a front-runner in the 2020 presidential primary, is known today as one of the most vocal champions for Medicare for All in the Democratic Party. But during her first Senate campaign in 2012, she and her aides were pressed on single-payer and dodged the question again and again, according to an analysis of newspaper reports, TV, and interviews with health care reform activists at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d Ture Turnbull, former executive director of Mass-Care, a single-payer advocacy group in Warren\u2019s home state of Massachusetts, said of her comments in the 2012 race. \"There were multiple times where we would approach her, and that was the standard response.\u201d\n\nWarren's refusal to embrace single-payer during that campaign came four years after she co-wrote an essay that called it the \"most obvious\" solution to the nation's health care woes \u2014 though perhaps \"politically unacceptable.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s remarks in 2012, as well as her more circumspect attitude toward Medicare for All at the beginning of her presidential campaign, has exposed her to criticisms from the left. That could become a liability, particularly if her progressive rival Bernie Sanders contrasts it with his decades-long support for single-payer. The two candidates have agreed to a non-aggression pact, but as Warren has risen in the polls, Sanders and his aides have begun to highlight differences between the candidates.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Sanders said no other presidential contender would prioritize single-payer as much as him. \u201cI'm glad that we have other people, in various forms, supporting it. I've been on this issue for I don't know how many years \u2014 20, 30 years, okay?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been my passion. I believe from the bottom of my heart that healthcare is a human right.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s record on Medicare for All has drawn scrutiny from some single-payer advocates. Many activists trust that she is fully on board with the policy and would push for it in the White House as strongly as Sanders, according to a survey of nearly 20 people and organizations that support Medicare for All. But some, including even Warren\u2019s allies, are less certain.\n\n\u201cWe know that if Elizabeth Warren is elected president, we\u2019re going to have to work hard to make sure she prioritizes it appropriately,\" said Sal Rosselli, president of the National Union of Healthcare Workers, which has endorsed both Sanders and Warren. \"We know that Bernie Sanders will because of history.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s embrace of Medicare for All in 2020 has proven pivotal. It has won her admiration from progressives who see it as a litmus test, and fueled attacks from moderates who say it makes her \u201cunelectable.\u201d It also appears to have helped her chip away at Sanders\u2019 base: A recent poll of the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire found that more voters who approve of single-payer back Warren than Sanders.\n\nWarren's previous hesitance toward Medicare for All could give Sanders' supporters, if not Sanders himself, an opening to attack her as less than authentic. Some of his fans already have gone there on social media. Health care is also a top concern for Democratic voters, and single-payer is fairly popular within the party, particularly among the progressives who are a key part of Warren's coalition.\n\n\u201cElizabeth believes Medicare for All should be the law of the land. She has made the case for why consistently and passionately,\u201d said Saloni Sharma, Warren\u2019s national deputy press secretary. \u201cShe spent her whole career studying why families go broke, and came to find that one of the top reasons for personal bankruptcies is health crises and medical expenses \u2014 even for families with insurance.\u201d", "description": "Seven years before Elizabeth Warren said \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for All,\" she was campaigning for the Senate and didn\u2019t want to talk about single-payer health care.
