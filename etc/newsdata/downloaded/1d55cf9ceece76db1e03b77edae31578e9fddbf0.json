Julien Warnand/Pool via REUTERS\n\nInflation in the euro zone languishes at less than half the ECB\u2019s target, the economic outlook is darkening again and support for Draghi\u2019s brand of aggressive money-printing has never been lower among rate-setters.\n\nAll that is taking the shine off an eight-year reign whose dramatic climax was Draghi\u2019s 2012 pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro \u2014 code for coming to the rescue of heavily indebted member countries and credited with averting the shared currency\u2019s collapse.\n\nBut more recent moves have been less well supported and Draghi is set to spend at least part of his final news conference defending last month\u2019s decision to restart the ECB\u2019s 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying programme despite opposition from a third of fellow policymakers.\n\n\u201cWe expect Draghi to come up with a strong \u2014 emotional \u2014 plea in support of the September package, probably combined with a broader attempt to safeguard the legacy of all measures taken under his leadership,\u201d said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s meeting, which will also by attended by incoming ECB president Christine Lagarde, Draghi is set to argue that a dismal flow of data has proved him right and may require the ECB to do even more.\n\nPrice growth in the euro zone was a paltry 0.8% last month, a global trade war has probably pushed the bloc\u2019s largest economy, Germany, into a recession and the risk of a hard Brexit continues to loom large.\n\nWhile policy is all but certain to stay unchanged after the bank unveiled a massive stimulus package just six weeks ago, Draghi will keep the door firmly open to even more stimulus if the outlook continues to sour.\n\nMarkets were calm ahead of the meeting, with the euro EUR= little changed against the dollar at 1.1143 and German 10-year yields DE10YT=RR at -0.39%, well up from lows of below -0.7% before the September ECB meeting but little changed on the day.\n\nFor investors, gauging sentiment on the Governing Council will be key after a very public spat followed the last meeting and culminated in Germany\u2019s appointee to the ECB\u2019s board, Sabine Lautenschlaeger, stepping down.\n\nThe turmoil is certain to extend into the mandate of Lagarde, who takes over on Nov. 1. She has promised a review of the bank\u2019s \u201cmonetary framework\u201d, likely to mean its policy goals and tools.\n\n\u201cLagarde\u2019s most pressing job will be to bridge the divisions,\u201d Berenberg analyst Florian Hense said. \u201cThe planned review ... could be of crucial importance for Lagarde to narrow the divisions.\u201d\n\nThe ECB\u2019s policy decision is due at 1145 GMT and Draghi\u2019s press conference starts at 1230 GMT.\n\nHAWKS CIRCLE\n\nLagarde will have to deal with objections that Draghi\u2019s policy of sub-zero deposit rates and massive bond purchases are hurting savers, squeezing banks and pension funds and inflating financial bubbles, while doing little for inflation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a few prominent hawks \u2014 including the central bank governors of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria \u2014 who question the wisdom of resuming the bond-buying programme.\n\nFrance\u2019s representatives on the Governing Council also joined the chorus and 95% of respondents in a Reuters poll said the stimulus package would not significantly help in bringing inflation back to the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2%.\n\n\u201cDissent within the Governing Council against the latest package cannot be ignored, especially since it is no longer coming exclusively from the same core countries,\u201d Gilles Moec, chief economist of French insurer Axa Group, said.\n\nThe problem for the ECB is that some of the major factors depressing prices are outside its control.\n\nThese range from demographic and technological changes to the euro zone\u2019s reliance on exports, in particular by German manufacturers, which leaves it bearing the brunt of the trade war.\n\nWith the ECB\u2019s firepower now largely spent, Draghi and his successor are likely to continue urging governments that are running a surplus, such as Germany and the Netherlands, to invest more to generate economic growth at home.\n\nBut latest budget figures, showing only a modest expansion, suggest their calls are likely to be frustrated for now.\n\n\u201cWe think ECB monetary policy will be on autopilot for a while,\u201d BNP Paribas said. \u201cWe think it will maintain its current hyper-accommodative stance well beyond 2020 and that the threshold for further easing is rather high.\u201d", "description": "Mario Draghi may be the man who saved the euro but his last news conference as President of the European Central Bank on Thursday is unlikely to be the grand finale he was hoping for.", "authors": ["Francesco Canepa", "Balazs Koranyi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444270866&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M23L-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
