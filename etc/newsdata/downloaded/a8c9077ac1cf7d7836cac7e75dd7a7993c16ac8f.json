The club had hosted popular Durban deejay Bongs and the shooting incident is alleged to have occurred at 3 am.\n\nThe man said: \u201cWe were parked outside waiting for customers; there was an argument outside the venue, and to our knowledge it was about a woman.\n\n\u201cThembe and I immediately separated the two parties and we tried speak to both groups to try and defuse the situation because we knew the men who were fighting. They went their way, and we went our way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then we saw one of the guys get into his car and he returned with a gun in his hand.\u201d\n\nNsele tried to step in again but a few minutes later he was shot in the mouth, the witness said.\n\nThe man said he had managed to take down the shooter\u2019s car number plate before he fled the scene. \u201cI was shocked and devastated at the same time.\n\n\u201cI rushed him to the clinic but he passed away not long after,\u201d he said.\n\nPlessislaer police spokesperson Captain Musa Ntombela said no arrests have been made yet and the investigation continues.\n\nNsele\u2019s mother Thandi said her family was reeling from the death of her son.\n\nShe said she received a call at 3.20 am informing her about the incident. \u201cWe rushed to the clinic but when we arrived they told us he had already died.\u201d\n\nThandi said she was dissatisfied that police had not arrested the shooter.\n\n\u201cWhat is stopping them from arresting my son\u2019s killer? We have given them a name and there were witnesses at the scene. Why has this man not been arrested?\u201d she said.\n\nShe described her son as a \u201crespectful\u201d person who got along with everyone.\n\nThe owner of 033 Lifestyle, Bonga Ndaba, said, \u201cAs a venue we pride ourselves in safeguarding our patrons, and this was an unfortunate incident beyond our control. \u201cWe hope that the police will arrest the perpetrator soon.\u201d", "description": "A popular Imbali nightclub was rocked by a fatal shooting in the early hours of Sunday morning.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7049/692370b542444221ae722ed459b073fd.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-20"}
