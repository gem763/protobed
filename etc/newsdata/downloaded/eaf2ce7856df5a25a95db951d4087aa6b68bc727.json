Use your hands to massage the vinaigrette into the kale, and let it marinate for at least 10 minutes to tenderize the sturdy greens. Finish the dish with a drizzle of sriracha and honey, but use a light touch: The point is to balance the heat and sweetness levels without overwhelming the delicate miso vinaigrette. If you like, double the dressing and refrigerate it for future use; it makes a fantastic dip for grilled chicken or pork, or a glaze to brush on salmon before broiling.", "description": "A hearty base of kale, quinoa and crisp tofu give this easy salad enough bite to serve as a meal Curly kale provides heft and holds up nicely to the sweet, sour and spicy dressing Use your hands to massage the vinaigrette into the kale, and let it marinate for at least 10 minutes to tenderize the sturdy greens", "authors": ["Corinne Trang", "Mark Bittman", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Sam Sifton", "Margaux Laskey", "Sarah Digregorio", "Kim Severson", "Ali Slagle", "Sarah Jampel", "Sarah Copeland"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/02/dining/ct-kale-and-quinoa-salad/ct-kale-and-quinoa-salad-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-02"}
