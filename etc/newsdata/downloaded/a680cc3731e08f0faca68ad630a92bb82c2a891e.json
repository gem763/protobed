I can't remember that far back.\"\n\nBut Uniqlo's Korean arm subtitled its version of the ad slightly differently, reading: \"I can't remember things that happened more than 80 years ago.\"\n\nThat would put the moment as 1939, toward the end of Japan's brutal colonial rule over the Korean peninsula, where the period is still bitterly resented, and some South Koreans reacted furiously.\n\n\"A nation that forgets history has no future. We can't forget what happened 80 years ago that Uniqlo made fun of,\" commented one internet user on Naver, the country's largest portal.\n\nThe phrase \"Uniqlo, comfort women\", in reference to women forced to become sex slaves to Japanese troops during World War II, was among the most searched terms on Naver at the weekend, and demonstrators protested outside Uniqlo shops on Monday.\n\nSeoul and Tokyo are currently locked in a bitter trade and diplomatic row stemming from historical disputes, and South Korean consumers have mounted boycotts of Japanese products.\n\nUniqlo -- which has 186 stores in South Korea -- has itself been one of the highest-profile targets, while Japanese carmakers' sales dropped nearly 60 percent year-on-year in September.\n\nThe company denied the allegations in a statement, saying the text was altered to highlight the age gap between the individuals and show that its fleeces were for people \"across generations\".\n\n\"The ad had no intention whatsoever to imply anything\" about colonial rule, a Uniqlo representative told AFP on Monday, adding the firm had withdrawn the ad in an effort at damage control.\n\nAnalysts said the controversy demonstrated the politicization of the neighbors' complex history.\n\nThe reaction was excessive, said Kim Sung-han, a former foreign affairs vice minister who teaches at Korea University, involving a \"jump in logic\" that \"assumes everything Uniqlo does is political as a Japanese company\".\n\n\"I don't see how her remark could be linked to the comfort women issue,\" he added. \"This is overly sensitive.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Japanese retail giant Uniqlo has pulled a commercial featuring a 98-year-old U.S. fashion figure from South Korean screens, it said Monday after it was accused of whitewashing colonial history.
