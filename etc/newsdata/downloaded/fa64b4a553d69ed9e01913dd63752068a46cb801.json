It now has formal diplomatic ties with just 15 nations in all.\n\nWu urged countries including the United States to \u201cpush back strongly\u201d against China\u2019s moves to diminish Taiwan\u2019s presence in the Pacific.\n\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t want to see the Pacific turned into another South China Sea, with us one day all sighing that it is too late for us to do anything,\u201d Wu said, referring to Chinese moves to build military installations on artificial islands and reefs in the disputed water.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry was not immediately available for comment.\n\nDiplomats attending the forum in Taipei include Sandra Oudkirk, U.S. State Department deputy assistant secretary for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.\n\nOudkirk\u2019s visit has been seen by some analysts and diplomats in Taiwan as an effort to shore up support for Taipei.\n\nTaiwan has come under pressure from Beijing, which includes regular Chinese bomber patrols around the island, since President Tsai Ing-wen took office in 2016. China suspects Tsai of pushing for Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, a red line for Beijing.\n\nTaiwan has accused China of trying to meddle in its upcoming presidential votes in January as Tsai is seeking re-election - an accusation which China denies.\n\nThe United States, which has a fraught relationship with China over trade, defense and technology issues, upholds what is known as the \u201cone-China\u201d policy - officially recognising Beijing and not Taipei - while assisting Taiwan.", "description": "Taiwan said on Monday China was practicing \"authoritarian expansionism\" in the Pacific, pointing to reports of plans for Chinese military presence in two Pacific countries that have recently switched diplomatic allegiance to Beijing from Taipei.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438004135&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960HI", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
