Creation of the command is an early step toward Trump\u2019s ultimate goal of establishing a Space Force, which would be its own military branch alongside the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy.\n\nTrump called space the \u201cnext warfighting domain.\u201d He first announced his intention to create a Space Force in early 2018. Its role would be to protect American satellites and spacecraft from foreign attack.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nTrump\u2019s initial suggestion of creating a Space Force was cause for mockery among his critics, who suggested the president \u2014 known for making grand pronouncements \u2014 envisioned extraterrestrial battles straight out of science fiction.\n\nThe reality of a Space Force, its proponents say, is a much more practical, earth-based operation to protect critical U.S. infrastructure in space from attack or hacking. Modern American society relies heavily on satellites for everything from GPS to banking systems to cellular service and a number of crucial military processes. The risk of these systems being compromised represents a significant national security threat, supporters of a Space Force argue.\n\nSkepticism about the need for a Space Force goes beyond jokes at the president\u2019s expense. There are pragmatic concerns as well. Most, if not all, of what the Space Force would do is already being done by the other military branches. Having a separate Space Force, some argue, would create a bureaucratic burden that would hold back the mission of protecting American interests in space. Some also say establishing the force would be much more expensive than the $2 billion estimate the Pentagon has produced.\n\nOthers argue that space should be a place for cooperation and innovation and that basing U.S. space operations within the military would make conflict more likely.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nTrump is free to reorganize various military functions into Space Command as he sees fit, but he would need congressional approval to make the Space Force its own branch of the military. Both the House and Senate have provisions that would establish a Space Force in their military defense spending bills. An effort to reconcile the differences between the two pieces of legislation may begin as early as next week, when Congress returns from recess. If successful, the Space Force could become a reality by 2020 or 2021.\n\nThe Trump administration has nonmilitary ambitions for space as well. NASA has announced a plan to send humans back to the moon and potentially to Mars.\n\nPerspectives\n\nSupporters:\n\nA Space Force is needed to protect against adversaries like Russia and China\n\n\u201cAside from the need for the American government to help set a course for building a successful future in space, there is also the very real danger of potential adversaries gaining an enormous advantage over the U.S. in this final frontier if we do not properly prepare.\u201d \u2014 A.J. Bruno, Washington Examiner\n\nIf America\u2019s satellites were compromised, it would be devastating\n\n\u201cThe stakes are high. Much of our 21st-century economy and lifestyle \u2014 from bank transactions to weather forecasting to television service to the GPS directions guiding you on your vacation road trip \u2014 depends on satellites functioning round the clock and without interruption. The military depends on them too. But space right now is a bit like the Wild West, with a wide-ranging mix of government and commercial satellites, all of them sitting ducks.\u201d \u2014 Eric Mack, CNET\n\nOther military branches can\u2019t be expected to have space expertise\n\n\u201cOne of the main concerns is being able to develop a military space cadre who understands the space domain and understands threats to U.S. military space systems and some of those threats are developing already.\u201d \u2014 Space security expert Kaitlyn Johnson to NPR\n\nThe Space Force will also protect U.S. economic interests in space\n\n\u201cOur nation is not taking the unprecedented step of setting up an independent space service just to provide better protection of our military satellites and improve space acquisition. That mission is too small to justify a separate service. Rather, the national leadership has an expansive view of America\u2019s economic future in space.\u201d \u2014 Peter Garretson, Politico", "description": "President Trump took the first major step in the proposed plan to establish a U.S. Space Force.
