Viewers are tuning in.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nA camera hovers over the field during a Cowboys-Dolphins game last weekend in Arlington, Tex. (Roger Steinman)\n\nThe dominant story lines of the early stages of this NFL season have been Antonio Brown being released by two teams amid allegations of disturbing off-field behavior, ongoing officiating controversies and attrition within the ranks of prominent quarterbacks through injuries, a benching and a retirement.\n\nAnd yet, by the metric most important to teams\u2019 bottom lines, the NFL is thriving: People are watching.\n\nThrough the Week 3 games, viewership of NFL games on television and digital platforms this season is up 4 percent from last year. Of the top 20 most-viewed programs on TV since the season started, 19 have been NFL games (the other is a Democratic presidential debate).\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that saying about all publicity being good publicity?\u201d a high-ranking executive with one NFL team asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I buy that in every circumstance. But you\u2019d have to say, at least, the negative stories that have been in the news cycle haven\u2019t been a hindrance,\u201d to viewership of games.\n\nNFL viewership was up 5 percent last season; there was an average of 15.8 million viewers per broadcast during the 2018 regular season, excluding games in London. Of the top 50 telecasts during the NFL regular season, 46 were NFL games.\n\n[How Antonio Brown\u2019s deal with the Patriots dissolved in a matter of days]\n\nLast season\u2019s increase reversed a two-year trend of declining NFL viewership. That included a decline of 9.7 percent in a trying 2017 season for the NFL that included a polarizing controversy, amplified by President Trump, over players\u2019 protests during the national anthem.\n\nNFL leaders at the time generally downplayed any connection between the controversy over the protests and TV viewership, focusing instead of the quality of the on-field product and the health of star quarterbacks over the course of a season. By last season, the controversy over players\u2019 protests mostly had dissipated and standout quarterbacks generally remained healthy and on the field, producing a high-scoring and appealing style of play that was attractive to viewers.\n\nThe NFL hoped to showcase those star quarterbacks and the play on the field this season in its celebration of its 100th anniversary. Instead, headlines have been dominated by Brown, who was released by the New England Patriots while the NFL investigated allegations by two women against him of rape, sexual assault and intimidation.\n\nThe officiating woes that reached a crescendo during last season\u2019s NFC championship game have continued into this season. Meanwhile, several star quarterbacks haven\u2019t been on the field. Andrew Luck retired from the Indianapolis Colts before the season. Eli Manning was benched by the New York Giants. The New Orleans Saints\u2019 Drew Brees, the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 Ben Roethlisberger, the Carolina Panthers\u2019 Cam Newton and the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 Nick Foles were injured.\n\nBut the NFL has marched onward, with its TV viewership continuing last season\u2019s recovery. Rookie Daniel Jones had a captivating NFL debut Sunday after replacing Manning as the Giants\u2019 starter. Fellow quarterbacks Kyle Allen of the Panthers and Gardner Minshew of the Jaguars also demonstrated star potential. The other off-the-field news has not led viewers to turn away.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s on or off the field, in season or out, there\u2019s a soap opera going on every day,\u201d Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said in an interview with CNBC earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift to television because it\u2019s constantly on the forefront of attention and interest.\u201d\n\nThe NFL has leaguewide revenue of about $15 billion per year, derived in large part from income from national broadcasting contracts that is divided equally among the 32 franchises. When NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke during an interview just before the season about the league\u2019s new entertainment and social justice partnership with music mogul Jay-Z, he mentioned an effort to broaden the sport\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making our entertainment better,\u201d Goodell said then. \u201cIt\u2019s about appealing to a broader audience, particularly younger demographics.\u201d\n\nOwners are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the NFL Players Association. The sport\u2019s current CBA runs through the 2020 season. If owners get their way, a deal with the players could include an expanded set of NFL playoffs and/or a 17-game regular season.\n\nThe extra games in a new CBA, along with ongoing labor peace, would bolster the NFL\u2019s negotiating position in bargaining for its next round of broadcast deals. The NFL\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d deal with Disney-owned ESPN expires after the 2021 season. Its contracts with other networks expire after the 2022 season.\n\n\u201cWe all know it would be better to get something done now [with the NFLPA] than two years from now when you could possibly have work stoppages,\u201d Jones said in his CNBC interview. \u201cThis would allow us to have a great platform of continuity, an agreement for years, that we can go to the networks and address streaming, address what our game is gonna look like on that tube.\u201d\n\nThe NFL has remained the strongest property on TV even while the league and the broadcast industry have struggled to deal with the changing dynamics of cord-cutting and content increasingly being consumed on phones and tablets.\n\n\u201cIn general, all television has depreciated, the viewership,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIf you will, it has gone to those handheld [devices]. It has gone to other areas. And of course the NFL wants to be a very substantive part of the alternatives to the traditional television screen \u2026. The idea of where we are with our viewership is so much stronger than when I got in the NFL in 1989 or when Fox came in in the early \u201890s. We\u2019re really in a very strong position.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nThe search for the next Sean McVay has created a new role: Head Coach of the Defense\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive\n\nRichie Incognito admits to \u2018a lot of crazy stuff in my past\u2019 but swears he\u2019s \u2018okay\u2019 now", "description": "TV ratings have remained on the upswing despite the controversy surrounding star wide receiver Antonio Brown and the absence of several top quarterbacks.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl", "September At Am", "Mark Maske Covers The Nfl For The Washington Post.
