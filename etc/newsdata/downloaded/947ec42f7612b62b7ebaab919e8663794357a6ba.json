Nearly 80 people \u2014 including 10 Americans \u2014 were inside the place of worship when a \"heavily armed perpetrator\" opened fire.\n\nANTI-SEMITISM LINKED TO FATAL GERMAN SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING THAT LEFT 2 DEAD, SUSPECT IN CUSTODY\n\nSuspect \"Stephan B.,\" a 27-year-old from the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where Halle is located, allegedly fired what appeared to be homemade weapons. Prosecutors said he fatally shot a woman on the street, outside the synagogue, and a man at a nearby kebab shop.\n\nThe attack, with the gunman ranting about Jews and denying the Holocaust in English, was live-streamed on the online streaming platform Twitch. It apparently was filmed using a head-mounted camera, and showed the perpetrator driving up to the synagogue in a car packed with ammunition and apparent explosives.\n\nThe suspect, a German citizen who has been charged with two counts of murder and nine counts of attempted murder, planned the attack, Germany's chief federal prosecutor Peter Frank said Thursday. He allegedly wanted to carry out a \"massacre\" in a synagogue and had roughly nine pounds of explosives in his car.\n\nFrank told reporters in Karlsruhe that \"what we experienced yesterday was terror.\" He said that the suspect wanted to create a \"worldwide effect\" by livestreaming his attack, in which two people were killed outside the synagogue. He wanted to encourage others to imitate him.\n\nANTI-SEMITIC GERMAN SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING WAS LIVESTREAMED ON TWITCH\n\nMax Privorotzki, the head of Halle's Jewish community, said there was security outside the synagogue when the shooting happened, but Josef Schuster, the head of Germany's Jewish community, said there were no police guards outside \u2014 which he called \"scandalous.\"\n\nSynagogues are often protected by police in Germany because of anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism, and police in two other eastern cities \u2013 Dresden and Leipzig \u2013 stepped up security at synagogues after the shooting in Halle.\n\nSchuster said members of the congregation on Wednesday described waiting behind locked doors for the police to arrive, which took more than 10 minutes.\n\n\"I am convinced that if there had been police protection there, in all probability the assailant would not have been able to attack a second site,\" he said.\n\nUN RELEASES FIRST-EVER REPORT ON ANTI-SEMITISM HIGHLIGHTING UPTICK\n\nPrivorotzki said he watched on surveillance video as the suspect tried to break into the synagogue.\n\n\"That was a shock for us, that was Yom Kippur, all phones were switched off, we had to understand what was going on first \u2014 then switch on my phone and then call the police,\" he told The Associated Press. \"It was really panic but I have to say after that, when the police came, we continued with the worship service, that lasted another three hours, the synagogue worship service.\"\n\nGermany's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, laid flowers outside the synagogue and met with community representatives, the first of several officials who were due to visit.\n\nCLICK TO VISIT THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nGermany's domestic intelligence agency has said that the number of anti-Semitic acts of violence rose to 48 last year from 21 the previous year. The agency also said that the number of far-right extremists rose by 100 to 24,100 people last year, with more than half of them considered potentially violent.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "After an anti-Semitic attack on a synagogue in Germany Wednesday left two people dead,\u00a0officials are working to reassure the Jewish community, which is unsettled amid rising concerns about far-right extremism.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
