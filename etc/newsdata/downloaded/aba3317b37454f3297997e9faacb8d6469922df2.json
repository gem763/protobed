The TV presenter\u2019s defence said it was a humorous show, drawings of mock election posters for other candidates had been held up and there was no intention to damage Le Pen.\n\nA first court hearing and an appeal hearing dismissed Le Pen\u2019s case, but a third trial was ordered. At appeal level, although the drawing of excrement was found to be offensive, judges decided that showing it on a TV show was not punishable by the law.\n\nFriday\u2019s final supreme court deliberation is the fifth time the case has been heard.\n\nNational Rally, which came first in the European elections in France this year, is in campaign mode for local elections next spring, seeking to hold on to its 11 mayors and gain more in its heartlands in the north and south-east.", "description": "Judges to decide whether excrement picture damaged far-right leader\u2019s reputation", "authors": ["Angelique Chrisafis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779389d54cbd6ee5b4ddaad801efa487e3c4f9cf/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f9393e00a14172328712149ceba73bdb", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
