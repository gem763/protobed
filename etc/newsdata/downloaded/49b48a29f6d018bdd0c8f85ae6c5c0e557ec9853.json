We believe that\u2019s the way we can get best out of the team,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit horses for courses, but we also believe it\u2019s also our most fit in-form, best available and best combination team.\u201d\n\nErasmus insisted there were no mind games in revealing a potentially little-changed match-day 23 or in his comments on tactics.\n\n\u201cNo, no bluffing!\u201d the former Munster coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably exactly the same 23, with Cheslin Kolbe being one of the guys who comes into the match-day 23.\u201d\n\nAs for tactics, he said that the team would only train twice, for a maximum of 160 minutes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a hell of a lot you can change in your tactics in two training sessions on a six-day turnaround. So you can expect pretty much the same from us on Saturday.\u201d\n\nErasmus expected England to be \u201cbrimming with confidence\u201d after their 19-7 semi-final win over defending champions New Zealand.\n\nHe highlighted England\u2019s outstanding linespeed in defence, which cuts down on time and space, and deprived the All Blacks any access to their free-flowing, off-loading game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played England four times in the last two years and the score is 2-2,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth teams have definitely improved since then.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 South Africa might have been criticised for their dull tactics at the World Cup, but coach Rassie Erasmus has promised more of the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/a1d4b3_south-africa-head-coach-rassie-erasmus-not-change-in-final-no-bluffing-springboks-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
