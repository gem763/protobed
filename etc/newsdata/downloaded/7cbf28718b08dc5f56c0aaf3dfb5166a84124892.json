Customs and consent had been the two big stumbling blocks since serious talks on Boris Johnson\u2019s renegotiation of the Brexit deal began this month. The tricky VAT problem wasn\u2019t yet settled when the DUP put its cards on the table, raising the possibility of the EU\u2019s worst nightmare \u2013 a fourth rejection in the Commons of the withdrawal agreement.\n\nWith five hours left until EU leaders were due to arrive for their summit, some of Brussels\u2019 most senior officials did not have a clue what would happen. \u201cMaybe we will have a deal or maybe not,\u201d one official said. \u201cWe somehow got used to this, we know that when Brexit is on the agenda we should expect the unexpected.\u201d\n\nAfter months of grandstanding on both sides, the wheels were turning. British and EU officials had worked into the small hours of Thursday morning to iron out their differences on VAT. The British had mostly caved in to EU demands that Northern Ireland should follow EU rules. With Brexit hanging in the balance, one of the last difficulties was a VAT derogation for sanitary products \u2013 an echo of an earlier battle between David Cameron and Brussels.\n\nAt 9.30am Johnson had a \u201cfriendly\u201d 20-minute phone call with Jean-Claude Juncker to discuss the results of the previous night. The prime minister thanked Juncker several times for his patience. At 11am the two men spoke again: they had a deal.\n\nLess than 30 minutes after putting the phones down, the announcement was made via two coordinated tweets that rallied the pound for a short while. \u201cIt is high time to complete the withdrawal process,\u201d Juncker said as he urged EU leaders to back the deal that day.\n\nJohnson turned to the slogan of the 2016 leave campaign: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2013 now parliament should get it done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities,\u201d the prime minister tweeted.\n\nIn reality much of Theresa May\u2019s deal remains, notably protection of the rights of 5 million citizens of the EU and UK affected by Brexit, the divorce settlement and a transition period. The rewritten Irish protocol is modelled on the EU\u2019s original plan for Northern Ireland, a proposal rejected by May 18 months ago, but the EU has given ground on consent.\n\nWhile Johnson sounded bullish, EU leaders did not hide their regret. Donald Tusk, the anglophile president of the European council, said he felt sadness. \u201cBecause in my heart I will always be a remainer. And I hope that if our British friends will decide to return one day, our door will always be open.\u201d\n\nJuncker said it was \u201chigh time\u201d to complete Brexit but also sounded a wistful note. \u201cThe good news is we have a deal \u2026 the bad news is that Britain will leave the European Union.\u201d\n\nHe also managed to rile British remainers by saying he had ruled out any extension of article 50 \u2013 in reality a promise the outgoing commission president cannot make.\n\nThe atmosphere in Westminster was febrile as attention turned to the 28 hardline Eurosceptics and about 20 pro-deal opposition MPs who might have their arms twisted into voting for Johnson\u2019s agreement. The Labour would-be rebels were largely silent, telling reporters they were \u201con lockdown\u201d and \u201cneeded some time to think\u201d about the enormity of the decision in front of them.\n\nOne texted to ask: \u201cIs it true that Juncker\u2019s statement means no more extensions?\u201d In conversations between them, they discussed whether they needed more time and reassurances on the legal text, possibly forcing Johnson into a short extension.\n\nEurosceptics also said they needed time to examine any legal text of an agreement. And there were rumblings of discontent extending wider than the original 28 so-called Spartans of the ERG who voted down the last agreement.\n\nIain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader who ended up voting for May\u2019s deal, said he had reservations. As he prepared for an interview with ITV, the prime minister\u2019s personal number flashed up on his phone screen. And one Eurosceptic was overheard by the Huffington Post\u2019s Paul Waugh shouting: \u201cIf you try and co-opt me, I\u2019ll fuck over the government, the prime minister, don\u2019t push me.\u201d\n\nBut a trickle of hardliners began to indicate they were likely to back the deal, including Andrea Jenkyns, Andrew Bridgen and Ranil Jayawardena. The most fervent Brexiter of them all, Steve Baker, continued to make positive noises. In a joint statement with Mark Francois, he said: \u201c*If* we vote for this agreement, after dealing with limited remaining concerns, we will also see through the implementing legislation to completion. Provided it is not adversely amended.\u201d\n\nWith the long-awaited Brexit legal text released just hours before the EU\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d deadline, EU leaders welcomed the prospect of a deal. Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, who recently voiced his anger at Johnson\u2019s no-show at a press conference, said he was positive.\n\nMaking his EU summit debut, Johnson toured the room shaking hands with fellow leaders during the on-camera mingling before the doors close. Smiling, a little play-acting, the prime minister performed a mock bow to one guest and got a friendly tap on the cheek from the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades. He shared a joke with Bettel, who laughed uproariously, slapping him on the back. It was a very different image to that of his predecessor, who was caught looking awkward at her first summit.\n\nAfter the pleasantries Johnson spent just 25 minutes talking to EU leaders, where he assured them he could get the deal through parliament. He used some of his brief time in the summit chamber to reminisce about his school years in Brussels, telling leaders of his life-long understanding of Europe. He said the UK had never been truly European, but always half in, half out.\n\nBeyond the bonhomie and backslapping, EU leaders fear Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could meet the same fate as May\u2019s. The EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told journalists that Johnson had reassured the commission he was confident the deal could pass.\n\nEU leaders have heard this talk before. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he \u201cwant[ed] to believe\u201d that Johnson would get a majority. One EU ambassador told counterparts they had an uneasy feeling about being at the mercy of the House of Commons for a fourth time.\n\nBrussels is nonplussed by British assurances, having heard estimated ratification times dwindle from six months to so many days. \u201cWe were told in 2018 by the UK government that the ratification takes six months,\u201d the senior EU official observed. \u201cIn the beginning of 2019 we were told it takes six weeks and the latest is that a few days is more than enough. So we will see.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s first EU summit is meant to be his last. But nobody on the EU side is ruling out anything, despite Juncker\u2019s public comments \u2013 politically useful for No 10 \u2013 about ruling out an extension. The EU president acknowledged the reality: \u201cI am not in charge of Westminster.\u201d", "description": "Beyond the bonhomie at EU summit, leaders fear PM\u2019s deal could meet same fate as his predecessor\u2019s", "authors": ["Jennifer Rankin", "Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a14ff0ea2c4f693be33a3bb726e76bd7d6157da9/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79e486ed95e732d5adde1bd786781956", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
