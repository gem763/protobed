Tilray (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile remained in the green, up about 0.3%.\n\n\u201cGiven the elevated inventory level currently held by provinces, which we have anecdotally heard is largely the \u2018mid-range\u2019 flower category, we believe provinces and retailers will likely implement price markdowns to accelerate product sell-through,\u201d Chen and Sklar said.\n\nBut not all producers are in the firing line, with smaller-scale producers such as Cronos, Sundial, and Supreme expected to steal share from their more illustrious rivals, according to the note.\n\n\u201cWe believe their flower products should have some quality differentiation relative to the over-saturated \u2018mid-range\u2019 flower segment,\u201d the analysts said.", "description": "StockBeat: Hazy Outlook on Pot Stocks to Continue, BMO Warns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE430E8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
