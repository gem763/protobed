In her graphic memoir, A Puff of Smoke, Sarah Lippett tells the story of the illness that struck her as a little girl and with which she lived until she was 18 when it was finally diagnosed and doctors were able to treat it. For obvious reasons, its pages are filled with baffled medics and kind nurses, noisy wards and futile tests, debilitating pain and scary, befuddling drugs. But they also speak of a great loneliness: here is a child who is not only unreachable, even by her devoted parents, but who knows herself to be so. If this doesn\u2019t make you cry, you may be a robot rather than a human being.\n\nHer first symptoms are terrible headaches; then she begins to drag one leg as she walks. At her local hospital in Stafford, she is put in an isolation ward while the staff try to work out the cause of her problems \u2013 the first time in her life she has ever been left alone. Brain scans are performed, and tests conducted on the fluid in her spine, after which she receives her (mis)diagnosis: she has hemiplegia chorea, an involuntary movement disorder. The drugs she is given for this have terrible side effects, among them urinary infections and hair loss, and naturally they do nothing to alleviate her symptoms. Only many years later, when her father insists on a referral to Great Ormond Street hospital in London, will doctors get to the heart of her condition. It turns out that she has moyamoya, a rare disease that constricts arteries to the brain, may cause strokes, and can only be cured by lengthy brain surgery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Jonathan Cape\n\nAll this may sound a bit relentless, and in a way, it is. Much of what Lippett describes is extremely gruelling. But there is joy here, too, and not only in her wonderful illustrations. As those who loved her first book, Stan and Nan, will know, she is so deft when it comes to the details of time, place and family life: here, her illness is one constant in a mosaic comprising sibling rivalry, parental strife and, once she is a teenager, her own love life (boys, she discovers, can be rather afraid of her condition). She can also be very droll.\n\nShe has a lot to say about authority figures, in this case not only her doctors, but also her teachers (the former often too distant and detached, the latter often inspirational), and she understands the way that illness and disability stir up fear in other people, a terror that can manifest itself as cruelty. But for me, the heart of her narrative has to do with stoicism: an expression of strength and, sometimes, of love that can be unfashionable in these emotionally incontinent times. She and her family are never resigned or accepting, but there is great patience and forbearance here: a surprisingly solid-feeling thing in a world in which they sometimes feel they have no agency. On the page, it\u2019s deeply affecting \u2013 and not a little chastening, too.\n\n\u2022 A Puff of Smoke by Sarah Lippett is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a318.99).
