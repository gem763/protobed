REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri\n\nAddressing hundreds of his supporters who have set up camp around his house in Addis Ababa, Jawar said: \u201cOpen the blocked roads, clean the towns of barricades, treat those who have been injured during the protests and reconcile with those you have quarrelled with.\u201d\n\nPeople have been killed in at least four cities since clashes broke out Wednesday, officials and a witness said, after police fired gunshots and teargas to break up demonstrations in support of Jawar.\n\nA media entrepreneur and activist from the Oromo ethnic group, the country\u2019s largest, Jawar organised protests that propelled Abiy to power last year.\n\nAbiy oversaw rapid political reforms after decades of repressive rule, winning international praise that culminated in last week\u2019s award of the Nobel Peace Prize for ending a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.\n\nBut the greater freedoms have unleashed long-repressed tensions between Ethiopia\u2019s many ethnic groups as local politicians claim more resources, power and land for their own regions. This week Abiy accused unnamed media figures of promoting ethnic interests over national unity.\n\nJawar, a one-time ally of the prime minister, has mobilised protesters from the Oromo ethnic group - the same group Abiy comes from. The showdown is a litmus test for Abiy: if he backs down, it could embolden Jawar and other regional powerbrokers. But widespread violence would tarnish his reformist credentials.\n\nA spokeswoman for the prime minister did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLate on Tuesday night, police had surrounded Jawar\u2019s house and told his bodyguard to leave, he told Reuters. Hundreds of people quickly gathered in support. Protests spread to other parts of the capital and other cities, where police fired teargas and bullets to disperse them.\n\nOn Thursday, Jawar supporters dug in, erecting tents outside his house and bringing mattresses. Some chanted: \u201cWe don\u2019t want Abiy, we don\u2019t want Abiy\u201d.\n\nHalf a dozen policemen stood at a distance from the protesters.\n\n\u201cOne week, one month, we don\u2019t care,\u201d said a young protester, who asked for anonymity for fear of repercussion from the security forces. \u201cWe will stay here until the government tells us why they did this to Jawar.\u201d\n\nPROTESTS AND POLITICS\n\nJawar, an Ethiopian-born U.S. citizen, mobilized many thousands of young men all over the Oromiya region to protest against the government from 2016 to 2018, finally forcing Abiy\u2019s predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn to step down - the first time a prime minister had resigned since independence.\n\nJawar and Abiy were photographed together frequently last year but remarks by the prime minister in a speech to parliament on Tuesday suggested frustration.\n\nAbiy said, without naming anyone, \u201cMedia owners who don\u2019t have Ethiopian passports are playing both ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried to be patient. But if this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia ... we will take measures.\u201d\n\nAbiy must walk a delicate line between increasing political freedoms and reining in strongmen building ethnic powerbases.\n\nSome Ethiopians have criticised Jawar for using ethnically-tinged language, but many young Oromo men consider him a hero.\n\nEthiopia is due to hold elections next year. The four main ethnically-based parties in the ruling coalition, which has held power since 1991, will compete with new, more strident parties in their home regions. Jawar could help mobilise support for the ruling coalition - or a rival.\n\n\u201cThe rise in tension and violence that ensued yesterday is driving wedges into the ever-widening fissures among political parties in the country,\u201d said Fisseha Tekle, Ethiopia researcher at Amnesty International.\n\nDEATH TOLL CLIMBS\n\nOn Thursday morning, the army was deployed in Dodola, about 300 km (185 miles) south of the capital, after six people were killed, said an official at Dodola hospital. He said three had been shot and three beaten to death.\n\n\u201cThe number will definitely escalate,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are hearing gunshots and people shouting.\u201d\n\nA army spokesman said he had no information on the army being deployed anywhere.\n\nIn the town of Ambo, 100 km (60 miles) west of the capital, five protesters had died from wounds from gunshots and stones since Wednesday, Oromiya regional police commissioner Kefyalew Tefera told Reuters by phone on Thursday.\n\nSecurity forces fired to disperse protesters setting tires alight, 30-year-old Solomon Kidanu told Reuters by phone as gunshots cracked in the background.\n\nIn Harar, 500 km (310 miles) east of the capital, police shot two people on Wednesday, an official said, and protesters killed a third because they suspected him of being an informant.\n\n\u201cToday the city is calm this morning but the road to Addis Ababa is closed by the young men,\u201d he said.\n\nA businessman in Addis Ababa told Reuters he saw two dead protesters brought to the city\u2019s Alert Hospital on Wednesday. Several roads heading out of Addis Ababa remained closed.\n\nResidents in several other towns and cities across Oromiya told Reuters that Jawar\u2019s supporters had begun to block roads.", "description": "Prominent Ethiopian activist Jawar Mohammed called for calm on Thursday amid protests that have killed 16 people and are challenging Nobel Prize-winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in his political heartland.", "authors": ["Tiksa Negeri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444506695&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N16N-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
