Sasol subsequently farmed out the permit to Eni, which will be responsible for operations with Sasol retaining a major interest in Block ER236.\n\nDue to numerous objections during the public consultation hearings, environmental authorisation was repeatedly withheld. However, the serious concerns of a wide range of environmental organisations and others, including tourism operators, leading marine scientists, recreational and commercial fishing operators, and subsistence fishermen, now appear to have been disregarded by DMR in in its drive to fast-track gas and oil extraction along South Africa\u2019s East Coast.\n\nDMR\u2019s environmental authorisation has approved the drilling of six exploration wells in Block236, within two areas of interest:\n\na northern area of about 1 717km2, which is located at its closest point, about 62km from the shore, with an expected drilling depth of 3 800 \u2013 4 100 metres from the sea surface through to target depths in the seabed;\n\nsouthern area, about 2 905km2, which is located at its closest point, 65km from the shore, with an expected drilling depth of around 5 100 metres.\n\nEquipment to be used include a deep-water drillship, supply and standby vessels and helicopters.\n\nAt various public hearings before the awarding of the environmental authorisation, concerns have been raised by WildOceans (the marine conservation arm of the WildTrust), Oceans not Oil, Earthlife Africa, Groundwork and the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA), and others.\n\nTheir concerns included\n\nhigh-levels of pollution caused by drilling operations,\n\nsea-bed and marine habitat destruction,\n\nsignificant impacts on the commercial fishing industry,\n\nadverse effects on marine life, including whales and dolphins, and\n\nhigh levels of fuel consumption and corresponding air emissions during the exploratory drilling phase.\n\nAlso, a previous scoping report stated that air emissions containing carbon dioxide, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and associated volatile organic compounds could \u201cresult in a short-term localised increase in pollutant concentrations\u201d and \u201ccontribute to regional and global atmospheric pollution\u201d.\n\nBlowout risks have also been a concern, frequently raised by the SDCEA.\n\n\u201cWhat if the same events that took place in the Gulf of Mexico were to occur here, with the exploration rig just a mere 62km from our shore?\u201d asked SDCEA coordinator Desmond D\u2019Sa. D\u2019Sa was referring to the 2010 blowout and explosion at the DeepWater Horizon ultradeep drilling rig which killed 11 people and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe spill affected 180 000km2 of ocean which is twice the size of KZN.\n\n'Inhospitable'\n\nD\u2019Sa said in view of the inhospitable character of South Africa\u2019s offshore sea, together with increasing cyclonic disturbances associated with global warming, the hazards of operating an offshore drilling rig in KZN\u2019s sea were exceptionally high.\n\nEni and Sasol were notified of the granting of the environmental authorisation on 29 August. Interested parties were advised by Eni\u2019s environmental consultants, Environmental Resources Management (ERM), on Tuesday that they have 20 days to appeal DMR\u2019s decision or any aspect of it.\n\n\u201cSuch appeal must be submitted on the prescribed form and in accordance with Chapter 2 of the National Environmental Management Act, 1998, (Act 107 of 1998): National Appeals Regulations, 2014,\u201d said ERM.\n\nAll appeals must be submitted by 30 September to the Minister of Environmental Affairs, in English, and copies sent to the DMR Head Office, to the Petroleum Agency of South Africa (PASA) and ENI.\n\nThis article is republished from GroundUp.
