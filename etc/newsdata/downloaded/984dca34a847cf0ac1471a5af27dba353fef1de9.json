Many of its players and managers are American, apparently.\n\nTheir basketball skills are amazing. They organise thrilling matches. But they hail from a country with ingrained traditions of personal freedom. Some speak their minds.\n\nHouston Rockets manager Daryl Morey retweeted the words \u201cfight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\u201d when he could have put: \u201cLong live His Excellency Xi Jinping!\u201d A Chinese boycott of the NBA is now growing even faster than its Chinese audience was.\n\nMost of the for-profit league\u2019s revenues outside the US come from China. About 300 million Chinese people play basketball. The audience for the NBA is more than double the entire US population at 800 million.\n\nSponsorships have tracked growing viewership, valuing NBA China, the league\u2019s local business operator, at more than $US4 billion ($5.9 billion).\n\nAbout one-tenth of its revenues come from sponsorships and merchandising. These are taking a hit. The Rockets were highly popular.
