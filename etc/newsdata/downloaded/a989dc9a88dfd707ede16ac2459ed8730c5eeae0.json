The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\u201d\n\nBut in his earlier remarks to reporters, Mr. Mulvaney pointed to \u201cthree issues\u201d that explained why officials withheld the aid: corruption in Ukraine, frustration that European governments were not providing more money to Ukraine and the president\u2019s demand that Kiev officials investigate the issue of the Democratic National Committee server.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in passing the corruption related to the D.N.C. server?\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said, referring to Mr. Trump. \u201cAbsolutely. No question about that.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nDemocrats ridiculed the reversal.\n\n\u201cMick Mulvaney was either lying then, or he\u2019s lying now,\u201d said Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat involved in the inquiry. \u201cI think he\u2019s lying now.\u201d\n\nAt the White House, staff members recognized that Mr. Mulvaney had created an entirely new controversy with his remarks. Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, said Thursday, \u201cThe president\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulvaney\u2019s performance was only part of another extraordinary day in Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Mr. Mulvaney made his remarks after he stepped before the cameras to announce that the leaders of the Group of 7 nations would meet in June at Mr. Trump\u2019s golf resort in South Florida, even as he acknowledged the choice could be seen as self-enrichment. In Texas, Mr. Trump hailed a Middle East cease-fire that would cement Turkey\u2019s goal of pushing Kurds from Northern Syria as \u201ca great day for civilization.\u201d\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Gordon D. Sondland, the president\u2019s ambassador to the European Union and a wealthy donor to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, was implicating the president in the Ukraine scandal by telling lawmakers that Mr. Trump had delegated Ukraine policy to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.", "description": "Conflicting comments by the acting White House chief of staff threw Washington into turmoil.", "authors": ["Michael D.
