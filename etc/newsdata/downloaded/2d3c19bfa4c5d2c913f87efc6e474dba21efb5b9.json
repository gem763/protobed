It is the only way, when you work on development, to get an intuitive sense of how people really live their lives.\u201d\n\nAs a result, she has brought fresh perspective to the field of development economics, treading a new path between proponents of huge transfers of aid to poor nations, and those who reject such help as a form of rich-world paternalism.\n\n\u2013 Influential friends \u2013\n\nDespite witnessing at first-hand acute malnutrition and misery caused by deprivation, the media-shy academic remains optimistic, stressing that poverty is in retreat globally.\n\n\u201cThe story of the fight against poverty is full of successes. Extreme poverty has fallen sharply, infant mortality has been divided in half, schooling for primary-age children has become almost universal,\u201d she told AFP in 2017.\n\nHer work has been supported by billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, and she was once an advisor to US president Barack Obama.\n\nDuflo is also a contemporary of the leftwing French economist Thomas Piketty, author of the best-selling book on wealth and inequality \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d and more recently \u201cCapital and Ideology.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Abhijit, Esther and Mike! Well deserved!\u201d Piketty said on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nThe lover of classical music was raised in Paris and is the daughter of a mathematician father and a paediatrician mother, whom she credits with giving her an urge to help people less fortunate than herself.\n\nDuflo attended the prestigious Henri IV school in the French capital and went on to win a place at the equally elite Ecole Normale Superieure university, a training ground for French academics.\n\nBut she left her home country to study at MIT, obtaining a doctorate in 1999 and joining the faculty. She secured tenure when she was just 29, marking her out instantly as a rising star.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Esther Duflo, one of three people awarded the Nobel Economics Prize on Monday, is a high-profile academic feted in the United States", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/49f1d3_duflo-had-favourites-economics-prize-esther-duflo-french-specialist-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
