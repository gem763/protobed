REUTERS/Nick Oxford\n\nThe U.S. has 904 working rigs, down 14% from a year ago, and even that is probably too many, estimated Harold Hamm, chief executive of shale producer Continental Resources (CLR.N), which has reduced the number of rigs at work.\n\nBankruptcy filings by U.S. energy producers through mid-August this year have nearly matched the total for the whole of 2018. A stock index of oil and gas producers hit an all-time low in August, a sign investors are expecting more trouble ahead.\n\n(For a graphic on debt from energy bankruptcy filings by year, see here here)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see activity drop across the industry,\u201d Earl Reynolds, CEO of Chaparral Energy (CHAP.N), told Reuters at the EnerCom oil and gas conference last month.\n\nThe Oklahoma energy firm has slashed its workforce by nearly a quarter, trimmed its spending plan by 5%, and agreed to sell its headquarters and use some of the proceeds to reduce debt.\n\nInvestment bank Cowen & Co estimated last month that oil-and-gas producers spent 56% of their 2019 budgets through June, based on its review of 48 U.S. companies. It expects total spending this year to fall 11% over last year, based on proposed budgets.\n\nThe slowdown in drilling is spurring cost-cutting in oilfield services, including staff cuts and restructurings at top firms Schlumberger and Halliburton Co. Schlumberger plans a writedown yet to be determined this quarter, noting its results in North America have been \u201cunder significant pressure,\u201d CEO Olivier Le Peuch said on Wednesday.\n\nHalliburton is paring its North American workforce by 8% because of customer spending cuts, and National Oilwell Varco recently offered buyouts to its U.S. workers.\n\n\u201cThe service sector I think is going to be flat,\u201d said Superior Drilling Services CEO Troy Meier, whose firm canceled plans to add new machinery.\n\nSuch signs of a downturn come as the shale sector had just started generating the cash flow long demanded by investors, who have grown weary of drilling expansions without returns. Last quarter, a group of 29 top publicly-traded producers generated more in cash - $26 million - than it spent on drilling and dividends, according to Morningstar (MORN.O) data provided by the Sightline Institute and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. A year earlier, the same group had spent $2.4 billion more than it generated.\n\nDespite that progress, many small to mid-sized shale firms are now pulling back on production targets amid the gloomy price projections.\n\nA slowing oil industry could weigh on the United States economy. The boom in shale oil output added about 1 percent to U.S. gross domestic product, or 10% of growth, between 2010 to 2015, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. In Texas, the center of shale oil production, energy employment dipped 1.8 percent in the first six months of 2019, according to the Dallas Fed. New drilling permits in the state fell 21% in July compared with the same month last year, according to state data.\n\nMAJORS STAY THE COURSE\n\nAny broader economic impact, however, could be limited by the massive investments in shale drilling by some of the world\u2019s biggest oil firms - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP PLC (BP.L). Even as small and mid-sized firms dial back, the majors continue to pour billions of dollars into years-long shale drilling plans. They have argued their integrated well-to-refinery networks allow them to control costs enough to withstand a sustained period of low prices.\n\nSpokespeople for Exxon, Chevron and BP declined to comment on the industry downturn but referred to previous statements of their longterm commitment to shale. Shell did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nChevron has focused much of its production growth plans on shale, and CEO Michael Wirth has called its Permian Basin holdings in West Texas and eastern New Mexico the \u201chighest return use of our dollars.\u201d\n\nExxon CEO Darren Woods told a Barclays energy conference on Sept. 4 that the company continues to take the long view.\n\n\u201cThe way we look at the business is tied to some very basic fundamentals that haven\u2019t changed for decades, if not hundreds of years,\u201d he said, noting it took oil a century to replace coal as the world\u2019s dominant energy source.\n\nExxon has estimated it can earn a double-digit return in the Permian Basin even if oil falls to $35 a barrel.\n\nBRACING FOR LOW PRICES\n\nU.S. oil prices largely have traded just above $50 a barrel since last November, requiring higher output to generate the same profit as when prices were higher. Prices this quarter are about 18% lower than this time last year, according to U.S. government data.\n\nU.S. oil prices are likely to remain below $55 a barrel for the next three years, said Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N), one of the largest oil producers in the Permian Basin. Lackluster prices will result in a \u201csignificant fallback in Permian growth\u201d and probably \u201cno growth for most,\u201d he said on a recent earnings call.\n\nPart of the slowdown comes as the best drilling spots in some areas of the field are being \u201cexhausted at a very quick rate,\u201d Sheffield said.\n\nThe severity of the looming downturn is a matter of debate.\n\nFlotek Industries Inc (FTK.N), a supplier of oilfield chemicals, has cut staff twice this year. CEO John Chisholm told Reuters that the industry is just \u201cpumping the brakes\u201d as it grapples with well-design issues.\n\nMatt Sallee, a portfolio manager at energy investors Tortoise Capital, expects a longer industry decline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how this gets any better for several quarters,\u201d he said.", "description": "Oil producers and their suppliers are cutting budgets, staffs and production goals amid a growing consensus of forecasts that oil and gas prices will stay low for several years.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hiller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426871781&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF850VI", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
