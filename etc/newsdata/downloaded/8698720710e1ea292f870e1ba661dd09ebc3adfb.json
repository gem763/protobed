I Don't Need A 'Second Act' To Feel Fulfilled.", "language": "en", "text": "I recently read an article about stay-at-home mothers over the age of 50 who went back and \u201cdid something\u201d with their lives once their children were grown. The article featured a mom who had given up her medical school training to stay home with her children, and then when she turned 50 and they were adults, realized she really wanted to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. Another mom stayed home to raise her children and after turning 50 became a highly regarded jazz singer. I say more power to them.\n\nAs a stay-at-home mom with two adult children, ages 25 and 21, I assume I\u2019m supposed to feel inspired by this article. I think I\u2019m supposed to want to go out and rekindle all of my deferred dreams or find new ones to pursue. Maybe I should go back to school to get my master\u2019s degree. Maybe I should pick an entirely new career. This is what our society expects, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re made to feel that we should always be doing something that advances or enriches our careers because without them, who are we, right?\n\nBut what if I don\u2019t want to? What if raising my children to become productive, happy, healthy adults was my career? What if, aside from the part-time writing I enjoy doing, well, I\u2019m just done? Now that my kids are grown and living their own lives and I\u2019m over 50, what if my mission is accomplished and I\u2019m just retired?\n\nBeing an accidental stay-at-home mother was the best career choice I could have ever made. It started when my older daughter was 3 years old and my younger was just a newborn. I hated my job as the managing editor of a small press that published books for librarians to help them stay abreast of their profession, and I was jealous of my friends who were stay-at-home moms. I wanted to be like them and spend my days with my kids \u2015 going to the park or bringing them to the library for children\u2019s story hour and teaching them all of the things they\u2019d need to know to become good, kind, successful people. So I discussed it with my husband, and we agreed that we could afford one year of me staying home with the kids, and then I\u2019d have to go back to work.\n\nAnd I honestly did think I would go back. I had never thought of myself as a stay-at-home mom. I\u2019d always assumed I would work and raise my kids, but after a year I realized how much I loved being at home and wanted more time with my daughters. Money was very, very tight, but my husband and I made it work and I ended up getting the dream job I\u2019d always wanted ... but never knew I wanted.\n\nWhat if raising my children to become productive, happy, healthy adults was my career? What if, aside from the part-time writing I enjoy doing, well, I\u2019m just done?\n\nI loved that I got to see all of my daughters\u2019 firsts \u2015 first steps, first words and first playdates. I loved picking up my girls from preschool and hearing them excitedly tell me about their days, show me their artwork and enthusiastically (sometimes) helped me make dinner. I loved having them in the kitchen with me while I baked bread nearly every night, their tiny feet on a chair next to me as we pounded at the dough together. I was shocked to discover that spending my days teaching them about the world was more fulfilling than any job I\u2019d had before.\n\nI loved the years my kids were in elementary school the most, when I got to watch my girls grow and develop and learn to read and make friends. I became very actively involved at their school and sat on an academic committee of parents and teachers, which I eventually headed up. I was part of the parent-teacher organization for every year I had a child in the school, and then I became PTO president. I was involved with nearly every one of their school\u2019s social or planning committees or I ran them. I was \u201cclass mom\u201d every year. I loved how everyone wanted what was best for the children and that we all worked hard to achieve that together.\n\nOne of my favorite things was the mother-daughter book club that I ran with a teacher. Not only was it a wonderful way for me and my fifth grader to connect, but it also helped me get through some very tough times as a parent, when one or the other of my girls was struggling and I was struggling to help them not struggle.\n\nMiddle school, of course, was a little dicier because the hormones had started flying, but my girls had friends and activities and were mostly doing well. Then came high school with all of its ups and downs \u2015 difficult classes, the pressure to do well for college, pressure to choose extracurriculars to put on the all-important college applications, long SAT preparation classes that went on for hours and ended at 10 p.m. There were mean girls to contend with and pain and tears to dry. Sometimes things were so low \u2015 a daughter crying for hours over something, or a daughter waking up dreading the school day, or me trying to convince them over and over that things were going to be OK \u2015 that I couldn\u2019t imagine how we would get out of whatever we were facing, but we did.\n\nThere were things I hated about my career at home, too. My second daughter wouldn\u2019t take a bottle, which meant we were glued to each other for a year straight (I like a little space now and then!). My older daughter had the kindergarten teacher from hell, and to this day I still regret not insisting that my daughter be moved out of that classroom. The PTO was often a strange place where mothers jockeyed for \u201cpower\u201d positions, and they were not always nice to me when I served as the PTO president. And sometimes, it seemed like my daughters\u2019 teen years would go on forever as they navigated their way through complicated feelings and relationships, all while getting to know and understand themselves as individuals.\n\nBut no career is perfect, and I have far too many great memories to fixate on the bad ones for very long. I loved watching two human beings grow up before my eyes and become productive citizens. When they graduated high school, I felt like they \u2015 and I \u2015 had accomplished something really good. When my older daughter graduated from college, I was not only so, so proud of her, but also proud of us \u2015 what we had done together. My younger daughter will graduate college in the spring, and I\u2019m sure I will feel the same way.\n\nStill, I haven\u2019t always felt secure in my role as a stay-at-home mom. It often feels like this country rests on the idea that everyone needs a career (specifically, one outside of the home) and, what\u2019s more, that everyone needs a career that is more important than anything else they do in life.\n\nWe often see it on TV in fictionalized stories of power-hungry lawyers or doctors juggling their work with kids or on talk shows when hosts discuss their children while making it seem like they haven\u2019t had to sacrifice anything to have their fast-track careers. I feel like I\u2019m supposed to think, \u201dThat could be me \u2015 that should be me \u2015 why isn\u2019t it? Why did I leave my career? How can I restart it? What did I give up? Why couldn\u2019t I have it all?\u201d\n\nAnd maybe some women do feel that way. But for lots of stay-at-home moms, being at home with our kids was \u2015 and is \u2015 enough.\n\nSo now that my kids are grown and I\u2019m not making any moves to dive back into the career I had before becoming a stay-at-home mom \u2015 or searching for a new one \u2015 what am I doing? I do what many people do when they retire: I write articles like this one as well as novels, and I love it. I have a friend I go to the movies with every time something comes out that we don\u2019t think our husbands will like. I have lunch with friends from time to time. I read a lot. I\u2019m always available to my extended family to help them with whatever they need. I do volunteer work.\n\nIn a few years, I hope to be helping with grandchildren, to still be writing, and to be enjoying my friends and family as much as I do now.\n\nI want to see more women who are proud of what they have accomplished and don\u2019t feel they have to explain or excuse why they didn\u2019t work outside the home because what they did was enough. It was more than enough: it was wonderful and literally life changing in so many ways.\n\nI understand that I\u2019m in a very privileged position. Despite how tight money was \u2015 and still is \u2015 for our family without two incomes, I realize that many other moms wouldn\u2019t even be able to make the choice that I made because they need to work to support their families. In many ways, being a stay-at-home mom \u2015 at least for me \u2015 was and is a luxury that so many other parents will never know.\n\nAnd I also certainly don\u2019t mean to bash moms who work outside of the home. Lots of my friends worked while our kids were growing up, and now that the kids are all out of the house, they\u2019re able to fully concentrate on their careers or concentrate on them in new ways: putting in more hours, going from part time to full time, making more money, having more disposable income than I\u2019ll ever see, achieving other new kinds of success. That\u2019s great ... for them.\n\nBut I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom over 50 who isn\u2019t really interested in any of that. I\u2019m happy with where life has led me, even though I couldn\u2019t have imagined it would turn out this way when I first became a mother 25 years ago. I have two happy, healthy adult daughters, and I write on the side as I choose to. I am fortunate that although money can be tight, my husband and I are not struggling on one income as so many do. I don\u2019t need \u2015 or want \u2015 another career, even though many people may not consider my career as a stay-at-home mom to be a \u201creal\u201d or worthy one.\n\nUltimately, I want the media to show more of us. I would love to see more mothers who had careers as mothers \u2015 successful careers that led to raising successful kids who became successful adults. I want to see mothers who were fulfilled by being people-raisers \u2015 mothers who, now with full-grown kids, get to step back and say, \u201cWow, my career was satisfying and worthwhile and productive.\u201d I want to see more women who are proud of what they have accomplished and don\u2019t feel they have to explain or excuse why they didn\u2019t work outside the home, because what they did was enough. It was more than enough: It was wonderful and literally life-changing in so many ways.\n\nWomen like me count as much as the mothers who have careers outside the home or who went back to their careers after their kids were grown or who started new ones. We just chose to have different dreams and to live those dreams knowing they would fulfill us just as other people\u2019s careers fulfill them. We don\u2019t need anything new or sparkly or different. We\u2019re done. And we\u2019re happy with where \u2015 and who \u2015 we are.\n\nJudy Mollen Walters is the author of six women\u2019s novels, with the latest, The In-Between-Place, published in March 2019.
