In March, he played Kim Jong Un in a sketch with episode host Sandra Oh. Outside Studio 8H, he co-hosts the podcast \u201cLas Culturistas\u201d and has earned fans through oddball videos featuring him expertly lip-syncing dialogue from movies and viral videos.\n\nYang, who is Chinese American, is a particularly celebrated addition to the sketch comedy series. As noted by Vanity Fair, SNL has featured so few cast members (not to mention hosts) of Asian descent over the years that the show has intermittently recruited Akira Yoshimura, its longtime production designer, to portray Sulu of \u201cStar Trek.\u201d (Yoshimura first appeared as the character in a 1976 sketch; he reprised it as recently as 2017.) Yang is also openly gay and has explored queer culture in his comedy. Last season, he co-penned the well-received \u201cGP Yass,\u201d which affably riffed on the appropriation of gay and drag culture.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFineman has performed with the Groundlings, the Los Angeles-based comedy troupe known for churning out SNL players including Maya Rudolph, Ana Gasteyer, Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig. On Instagram, where she goes by @chloeiscrazy, she has posted videos of herself impersonating tween-favorite YouTube star JoJo Siwa, actor/fashion plate Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and her own mom.\n\nGillis was recently featured in Comedy Central\u2019s annual \u201cUp Next\u201d showcase. One profanity-laced routine posted to the network\u2019s YouTube account pokes fun at his rural upbringing \u2014 and the culture shock he felt moving to Philadelphia and, later, New York. \u201cI took Skoal out of my mouth to come up here, and I didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump,\u201d he jokes. \u201cThat makes me like the Nelson Mandela of Central Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nHours after SNL announced the casting news, journalist Seth Simons tweeted a video from September 2018 of Gillis recording an episode of his podcast alongside co-host Matt McCusker. In it, both men use slurs against Chinese people, mock their accents and make other racist remarks about Chinatown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, what are you guys doing here? Get these ducks out of the window,\u201d Gillis says, one of the milder comments in the video. Later in the episode, Gillis says that \u201can Asian trying to learn English bothers me more than someone listening to, like, Lil Uzi Vert while I\u2019m trying to eat ... dinner. Nice racism. Good racism. I love to be ... racist.\u201d\n\nSimons, as well as Reddit users on a \u201cMatt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast\u201d fan page, suggested that episodes of the podcast had recently been scrubbed from the Internet. Fans cautioned each other to be wary of circulating links to the episodes.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday evening, Gillis described himself as \u201ca comedian who pushes boundaries,\u201d then added that he is \u201chappy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNBC has not yet responded to The Washington Post\u2019s request for comment. SNL\u2019s 45th season will premiere on Sept. 28. It will notably not feature Leslie Jones, who announced last month that she would be leaving after five seasons.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nRead more:\n\nLeslie Jones will not return to \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019 Sorry, Kyle Mooney.\n\nWho should play the Democratic presidential candidates on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019?\n\nThe quiet brilliance of Kenan Thompson\n\nAD", "description": "The sketch comedy series announced the hiring of Bowen Yang, Chloe Fineman and Shane Gillis.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iYUrO8Y-CydzCYLjhfD3MQjOfAg=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-13-2019/t_1a5561eb17784bd19b5e4e95dee0d5c0_name_assembly_V1_00_03_48_20_Still002.jpg"}
