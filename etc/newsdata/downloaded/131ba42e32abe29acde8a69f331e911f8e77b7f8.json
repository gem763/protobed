For comparison\u2019s sake, it\u2019s believed the asteroid which killed the dinosaurs was between seven and 50 miles in diameter.\n\nIt has a 6% chance of hitting Earth at some point in the next 10 million years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a paper published on Arxiv, astronomers said their analysis has \u2018identified a likely parent [of the Kyoto fireball], the binary near-Earth asteroid (164121) 2003 YT1.\n\nIf humanity was still around to witness a cataclysmic impact from this apocalypse asteroid, we could face extinction or, at the very least, endure death and carnage on a global scale.\n\nThe impact would cause a fireball which would wipe out everything within a radius of hundreds of miles, throwing so much dust into the air that crops would fail around the world and mass starvation would threaten our species\u2019 future.\n\nWriting about an impact from a similarly sized object in a post on Quora, mathematician and space expert Robert Walker wrote: \u2018it would produce a crater 46 kilometres in diameter.\n\n\u2018The firestorm including debris thrown up and landing and starting up new fires would extend to 600 km from the impact point.\n\n\u2018There would be regional earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunami (if it hit the sea). Skies darker than the darkest cloud cover from the dust thrown up into the upper atmosphere, global temperature drops 8 degrees celsius for a week and moderate global effects for months. No summer that year.\n\n\u2018Plant growth is disrupted for years and there are some global crop failures and some regional extinctions. We get hit by one of these roughly every half million years on average.\u2019", "description": "Humanity could face extinction if the doomsday space rock smashed into our planet.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89425477_1571657249.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
