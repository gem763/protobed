The person who gets knocked out will be a meme... there is a lot riding on this.\n\n\"I'll be tormented forever, that moment would be in my history forever.\n\n\"I want to show that I can beat him; I did beat him in the last fight, he just got lucky. If there was a seventh round he would have been knocked out, he was exhausted.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Now there's no headguards and 10oz gloves, I'm going to show everyone that he's nothing. I'm going to show my will, knock him out and move on.\n\n\"I want to knock him out; I haven't knocked someone out properly. I've done it in sparring, but not in front of the world.\"\n\nKSI and Paul have come under fire for fighting as professionals - but the former believes it can help grow the sport.\n\n\"I 100 per cent think this is going to bring in new fans,\" he added.\n\n\"With the Joe [Weller] fight and the Logan fight, I've had hundreds of thousands of messages saying I've inspired people to get into boxing.\n\n\"A lot of my fans don't care for boxing, they're just invested in me and whatever I do they look at it and say, 'I want to do that'.\"", "description": "KSI and Paul clash for a second time when they meet at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 9", "authors": ["Martin Domin", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20757944.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_KSI-VS-Logan-Paul-2-Launch-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
