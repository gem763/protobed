The House should move on from \u201cwitch hunt\u201d investigations, he wrote, and \u201cget back to work on drug prices, health care, infrastructure and all else.\u201d\n\nBut on two of those three issues, Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals about his willingness to actually negotiate. Mr. Trump called action on infrastructure \u201ca necessity\u201d during his State of the Union address in February, yet he angrily canceled a meeting on the subject with Democratic leaders in May after learning that Speaker Nancy Pelosi had suggested he was engaged in a \u201ccover-up,\u201d and talks ground to a halt.\n\nNor has Mr. Trump backed up his talk of action on health care. The president has said he will submit to Congress a health care plan to completely replace President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and told ABC News in mid-June that he would do so \u201cin about two months, maybe less.\u201d More than two months later, he has not done so, and many Republicans are skeptical that he ever will.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
