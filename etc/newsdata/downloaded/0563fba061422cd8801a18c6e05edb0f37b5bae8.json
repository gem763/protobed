(AP) - Eric Weddle is one of the most durable safeties of his generation, and he never sat out an entire preseason in the first 12 years of his NFL career.\n\nWhen he joined the Los Angeles Rams, Weddle realized coach Sean McVay does things a little bit differently.\n\nWeddle and nearly every Rams starter didn\u2019t participate at all in the just-completed preseason, and they won\u2019t get their first real game action together until Sunday in their regular-season opener at Carolina.\n\nThe veteran safety appears to be meshing splendidly with his new teammates, but Weddle truly won\u2019t know how they all fit together until they finally get on the field for the first time.\n\n\u201cI know for me personally, there are some benefits of playing (in the preseason), but the benefits don\u2019t outweigh the negative enough to chance it,\u201d Weddle said. \u201cWith the way we practice, the way we compete, it\u2019s as game-like as it can be with the low risk of injury. You\u2019d hate to lose a guy playing in one preseason game. You\u2019ll get your timing down in a quarter or two, and you\u2019ll be right back in the rhythm. We\u2019ve had great work, though. We\u2019ve pushed each other to the limit.\u201d\n\nMcVay kept his entire offense out of the 2018 preseason, preferring to preserve his players\u2019 health at the expense of potentially beneficial experience. His extreme measures were met with a few raised eyebrows, but then the ostensibly rusty Rams starters went 8-0 and steamrolled the NFC West before reaching the franchise\u2019s first Super Bowl in 17 years with one of the healthiest teams in the league.\n\nMuch of the NFL edged toward adopting McVay\u2019s philosophy last month, with many teams playing their key starters far less than in previous preseasons.\n\nThe Rams started game preparations Monday with almost every significant expected contributor in good health. That was the goal when McVay decided to avoid the preseason again, preferring to keep his players fresh for the grind of defending an NFC championship.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference in the preparation and the way that we\u2019re approaching things right now,\u201d McVay said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on this year. I think our guys have done a great job of having that singular focus on just producing in the present.\u201d\n\nThe Rams\u2018 only big injury in the preseason happened to linebacker Micah Kiser, a backup last season projected to be a starter this fall before he injured his pectoral muscle and required season-ending surgery. Because he was trying to cement his new role on the defense, Kiser was one of the few key players who suited up in the preseason.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 starters didn\u2019t go without competition in August. They held joint practices with the Oakland Raiders and the crosstown Chargers, and McVay staged a handful of practice scrimmages for his team with officials and game-like conditions.\n\nBut the revamped defensive lineup has yet to be in a real game, and the offensive line still hasn\u2019t tested its two new starters. Center Brian Allen and left guard Joe Noteboom will make their first NFL starts Sunday.\n\n\u201cI think people are going to say we haven\u2019t played, or stuff like that,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an excuse. We\u2019re going to be ready for Sunday, and we\u2019ve been going live against our defense all camp. The Chargers, the Raiders, we\u2019ve got action against other teams at a live pace. It\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t been playing football.\u201d\n\nNoteboom said the offensive linemen have an advantage in practice preparation: They have to face Aaron Donald, the back-to-back AP Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into a game, you know it\u2019s going to be easy because you\u2019re not going to see anyone better than him,\u201d Noteboom said.\n\nNOTES: The Rams put backup LB Justin Lawler on injured reserve Monday after initially keeping him on the 53-man roster. The procedural move means Lawler can return from foot surgery after the first eight weeks of the season. \u2026 Los Angeles signed C Coleman Shelton to the active roster in Lawler\u2019s place. Shelton, the ninth offensive lineman on the 53-man roster, was cut by the Arizona Cardinals last weekend. He is a Pasadena native who played at Loyola High School near downtown Los Angeles. Shelton said he was pleasantly surprised to hear from the Rams: \u201cYou never know who has been watching you on (video).\u201d Shelton is the fifth University of Washington product on the roster, joining his former teammates Marcus Peters, Cory Littleton and rookies Taylor Rapp and Greg Gaines.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Eric Weddle is one of the most durable safeties of his generation, and he never sat out an entire preseason in the first 12 years of his NFL career.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/rams_game_planning_football_00809_c0-146-3491-2181_s1770x1032.jpg?7c0a75203d90eb4e4bc0100dbde666561f24e4c4"}
