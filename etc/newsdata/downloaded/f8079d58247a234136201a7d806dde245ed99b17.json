Yellen has graduated to writing anniversary cards, thank-you notes, holiday cards and get well cards to employees children when they're sick.\n\nYellen found this small act of kindness has cultivated an empathetic and understanding office culture.\n\nYellen (left) believes writing birthday cards and other personalized notes help create a compassionate work environment for his workers\n\nHe said: 'When I learn of random acts of kindness being performed in the field, I take it upon myself to again, reach out in writing, and send a thank you card so that person can know they are appreciated and that their efforts don't go unnoticed.'\n\n'It's also something that doesn't have to cost a thing.'\n\nYellen knows his approach to leadership is at odds with many high powered CEO's, but it's one he stands firm in.\n\nHe told Thrive Global: 'Without team comradery it would be nearly impossible for a company to grow and be successful if team members aren\u2019t happy and engaged.'\n\nIn 2018, Yellen (pictured) had his kindess returned tenfold after he employees sent him more than 8,000 birthday for his 60th birthday\n\n'My philosophy is simple \u2014 if you take care of your people, your team will in turn take care of your customers!'\n\nHis is philosophy is backed up by surveys and career experts.\n\nBusiness Insider reports that workers believe the best managers are the ones who give positive reinforcement and acknowledge their well-being.\n\n'When leaders forget about the human element, they're holding back their companies and limiting the success of others.'\n\n'Focusing only on profit and forgetting that a company's most important asset is its people will ultimately stifle a company's growth.'\n\nHis employees have responded to this approach tenfold, proving their appreciation in 2018 when they sent more than 8,000 cards for Yellen's 60th birthday.\n\nHis executive assistant, Gail Kennedy, told Detroit Free Press: People call and say that they want to send him a birthday gift. But, he really doesn't like receiving gifts or having anyone spend money on him. I say, 'Write a personal note. That means to him more than anything.'", "description": "Sheldon Yellen, CEO of BELFOR Holdings, Inc., writes all 9,200 of his employees birthday cards every year and believes doing so cultivates a compassionate work culture", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/06/19524186-0-image-a-44_1570683709856.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
