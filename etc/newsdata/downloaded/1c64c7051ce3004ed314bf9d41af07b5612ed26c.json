This is the right and responsible thing to do \u2014 we must get on with governing,\u201d he added.\n\nBritain and the EU are currently locked in last-ditch talks to secure a divorce deal ahead of a crunch two-day summit for European leaders in Brussels starting Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson insists that Britain will leave the bloc on October 31 as scheduled, even without an agreement.\n\nBut British MPs last month passed a law requiring him to request a Brexit extension if no deal has been finalised by the end of the summit.\n\nIt remains unclear how Johnson intends to proceed in such a situation.\n\nMeanwhile the budget, Javid\u2019s first as chancellor, was expected to build on proposals he set out last month for infrastructure, including hospitals and railways.\n\nHowever Jon Trickett, the Labour Party\u2019s Cabinet Office spokesman, was sceptical the budget would be delivered as planned, with opposition parties threatening to topple Johnson\u2019s government and the prime minister himself pushing for a snap election.\n\n\u201cI would be surprised if there is a budget at that time because they\u2019ve no idea whether they\u2019re going to get this Brexit proposal through the House (of Commons) or not,\u201d he told BBC Radio.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Britain\u2019s government is planning a first post-Brexit budget for November 6, one week after it expects the country to have left", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/df3e58_he-announcing-an-infrastructure-revolution-uk-government-sets-date-post-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
