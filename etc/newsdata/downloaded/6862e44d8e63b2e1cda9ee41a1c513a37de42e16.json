USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES -- It\u2019s not a crisis just yet.\n\nBut keep that panic button within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nSean McVay will wake up Monday morning with the type of problem he has yet to face as Los Angeles Rams head coach.\n\nAfter being physically dominated by undefeated San Francisco on Sunday afternoon at the Coliseum, the Rams (3-3) are mired in their first three-game losing streak under McVay.\n\n\u201cWas it a humbling day for us?\u201d McVay asked. \u201cAbsolutely. But it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to learn from. We\u2019re not going to let it demoralize us.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, they sit in third place in the NFC Week, a division the Rams have dominated since McVay was plucked from Washington to replace Jeff Fisher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about this performance, other than learn from it,\u201d McVay said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know how to do. That\u2019s why we will do and we\u2019re going to work as hard as possible to do that.\u201d\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay doesn't like when he sees in the loss to the 49ers. (Photo: Orlando Ramirez, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLos Angeles went wire to wire to win the NFC West in McVay\u2019s first two season as head coach. The first time it looked up in the division standings under McVay was after the wild Week 4 loss to Tampa Bay, 36 games into his tenure.\n\nAnd now, the Rams are starting to lose touch with 5-0 San Francisco and 5-1 Seattle, who both own valuable head-to-head wins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gut check,\u201d said quarterback Jared Goff, after San Francisco held him to a career-low 78 yards passing. \u201cAre you who you say you are?\n\n\u201cI know who this team is. I know who these players are. I know who our coaches are. We have so much faith and belief in Sean and everyone else. We\u2019re going to get right back on track.\"\n\nAfter driving the length of the field on seven running plays on the opening possession, taking a 7-0 lead on Robert Woods\u2019 8-yard end around, they managed just 101 yards of total offense over the final 51 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe came out ready to go,\u201d McVay said. \u201cTo be able to have a seven-play drive, seven runs, all in manageable down and distances, there was a good enthusiasm. There was a good juice.\n\n\u201cThat was the way that you wanted to start. We have to do a better job after that of being able to continue that momentum.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco tied the game on Tevin Coleman\u2019s 2-yard run in the first quarter and took control after a fumble by Rams rookie running back Darrell Henderson on the first play of the second half.\n\nJimmy Garappolo\u2019s 1-yard sneak on third and goal and two Robbie Gould field goals were enough for the 49ers to improve to 5-0 for the first time since 1990.\n\nThe Rams were left to kick themselves for missed opportunities, like running back Malcolm Brown being stopped on fourth and goal from the San Francisco 2 in the second quarter, and a pair of turnover on downs in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cThe reality is NFL football games come down to little, tiny plays here or there throughout game,\u201d veteran tackle Andrew Whitworth said. \u201cIn the year before or even in 2017, we found a way to execute those little moments and get the momentum back, or make a big play that got us in the game or to take a lead and get control of the game.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just missing those plays. And when you do, it all just kind of piles on you.\u201d\n\nThat has started up front, where the Rams have been unable to solve an offseason transition on the offensive line, in which second-year center Brian Allen and second-year guard Joe Noteboom replaced the departed John Sullivan and Rodger Safford, respectively.\n\nTo make things worse, Noteboom suffered a potential serious leg injury in the first half on Sunday and was replaced by another second-year lineman, Jamil Demby.\n\nCertainly, offensive line coach Aaron Kromer didn\u2019t expect any of the three young players to be the finished article, but their rough edges have shown.\n\nThe Rams entered Week 5 ranked No. 31 in the league in pass blocking and run blocking, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n\u201cReally it\u2019s just figuring it out,\u201d McVay said. \u201cLet\u2019s figure out the best way to maximize guys\u2019 skill sets. That\u2019s a very vital part of football.\n\n\u201cFootball\u2019s the greatest team sport there is, and we\u2019ll continue try to develop guys. That\u2019s the only way that we can move forward.\u201d\n\nOne of the healthiest teams in the league the past two seasons, the Rams have also been hit with a spate of injuries. They were without running back Todd Gurley (quadriceps), linebacker Clay Matthews III (broken jaw) and cornerback Aqib Talib (ribs) on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, in the NFL \u2026 the healthiest teams are usually the best ones,\u201d Whitworth said. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with that a little bit. You know what, there\u2019s no excuses. You find a way to help each other out, coach each other up and go to the drawing board and find a way to win. That\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nHowever the defending NFC Champions have reached mediocrity, that\u2019s where they find themselves this week, .500 for the first time since the second week of the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cThree losses in a row,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little adversity for us. But, as a team, we preach about adversity, getting over it and sticking together as a family. We\u2019re definitely going to get back to that.\u201d\n\nAnd they won\u2019t see the Coliseum again for a month.\n\nThey make road trips to Atlanta, London (for a home game against Cincinnati) and Pittsburgh before hosting Chicago at the Coliseum on Nov. 17.\n\nSo, for the Rams, things are unlikely to get easier, before they get better.\n\n\u201cI trust that this is a mentally tough team,\u201d McVay said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got mentally tough people in our building. This is a real opportunity to be what we say we are.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to go to work. We\u2019re going to stay together. We\u2019re not going to let the outside influences create a divide within us. That\u2019s something that I trust we will do.\u201d\n\nJoe Curley covers the Rams for the Ventura county Star.
