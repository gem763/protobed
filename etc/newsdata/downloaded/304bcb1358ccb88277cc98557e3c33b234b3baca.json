'Because the compulsory stop sign is also a give way sign too, except that ''stop'' has more traffic force than the give way sign on its own.'\n\n'I would have thought the truck should give way as he has to come to a complete stop,' another person added.\n\nBut when the Department posted the correct answer, those drivers proved to be wrong.\n\nThe Department captioned the post (pictured) 'you know your road rules and now\u2019s your chance to prove it,' but the response of road users showed many were wrong at who should give way\n\n'The answer is that the motorcycle must give way to the truck,' the Department wrote.\n\n'A stop sign is not more powerful than a give way sign.\n\n'When two motorists arrive at stop or give way signs, the signs cancel each other out and the normal give way rules apply. Under these rules, if a motorist is travelling straight ahead, they must give way to any vehicle approaching from the right.\n\n'The motorcycle must give way to the truck because the truck is on their right.'\n\nThe response stumped many viewers.\n\n'Wow, I never knew this,' one comment says.\n\n'I got run over by the truck,' another wrote.\n\n'Why would you make such a confusing road rule?' another user posted.\n\nSome drivers suggested the Department should note the people who get the wrong answer.\n\n'I am scared with some of the answers on here I cannot believe that some people have a license and are on the road,' one comment reads.\n\n'These questions are an perfect opportunity to take down names - revoke licenses and force refresher courses on drivers,' another said.\n\n'Scary to think they drive among us.'", "description": "An image of a truck and a motorcycle at an intersection was posted on the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads Facebook page, which asked which vehicle has right of way.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/08/20270524-0-image-a-12_1572250620700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
