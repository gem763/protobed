But are you ready? Saudi Arabia, at my request, has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s a first. But Saudi Arabia \u2014 and other countries, too, now \u2014 but Saudi Arabia has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing to help them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Trump, remarks to reporters, Oct. 11\n\n\u201cThen the president said, \u2018Well, the reason I\u2019m taking the troops out of Syria is because I promised them at campaign to bring the troops home.\u2019 My question to him was, \u2018Is Saudi Arabia home? Is Saudi Arabia home? Why are our troops going to Saudi Arabia if you promised to bring them home?\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, the Saudi Arabians are paying for it.\u2019 Really, we\u2019re putting our troops in harm\u2019s way for Saudi Arabia because they\u2019re paying \u2014 it just didn\u2019t add up.\u201d\n\n\u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), recounting to reporters a conversation at the White House with Trump, Oct. 17\n\nPresident Trump has a soft spot for Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s where he took his first overseas trip as president. He also worked hard to rehabilitate on the world stage its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, after the CIA concluded he had ordered the 2018 assassination of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe administration announced Oct. 11 that it was sending to Saudi Arabia an additional 3,000 troops, along with about four dozen Air Force fighters and Patriot antimissile batteries, in response to attacks on Saudi oil facilities that U.S. officials blame on Iran. \u201cThe United States is raising the costs of Iran\u2019s revolutionary adventures while increasing incentives for pragmatism to prevail,\u201d said Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran.\n\nWhat caught our attention is that the president claims that Saudi Arabia will pay all of the costs \u2014 \u201c100 percent\u201d \u2014 of the deployment, including \u201cthe cost of our soldiers.\u201d Some critics have charged that Trump is turning U.S. troops into mercenaries, available to the highest bidder. Since the president has a long history of inflating what he has supposedly negotiated from Saudi Arabia, we thought we would investigate.\n\nThe Facts\n\nNotice that Trump claims he negotiated this deal in a \u201cvery short time \u2014 like, maybe, about 35 seconds.\u201d In previous White Houses we have covered, such a stunning act of negotiation would be accompanied by readouts by presidential aides, eager to explain how such a coup came about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut, in this case, just crickets from the White House, except for the bragging by the president himself. White House officials would not explain what Trump meant.\n\nSo, we checked with the Pentagon for more details on the supposed payment arrangement. Officials at the Defense Department deflected our inquiry, telling us to contact the State Department.\n\nHmmm, experience has taught us that this is a sign that any such deal is still under negotiation. Otherwise, the Pentagon would have been happy to discuss it.\n\nSure enough, we ended up with a carefully crafted statement from State that certainly reinforced that impression.\n\nThe core of the statement, attributed to a State Department spokesman, said: \u201cWhile we will not comment on specific bilateral defense agreements, more broadly the United States encourages burden-sharing among partners in support of shared security interests, to include defense of the Arabian Gulf.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNotice the \u201cencourages burden-sharing\u201d language. That certainly sounds like an aspiration, not a negotiated outcome. And the State Department won\u2019t comment on a \u201cspecific bilateral defense agreement\u201d even though the president is talking about it? That doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nWe checked with the relevant committees in the House and the Senate \u2014 Defense, Foreign Affairs and Appropriations \u2014 and none could report an understanding of the president\u2019s claim. The Saudi Embassy did not respond with an explanation, either.\n\nWhen NBC News reported in July that U.S. troops were being dispatched to Prince Sultan Air Base, it quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that \u201cSaudi Arabia has already agreed to pay some of the costs associated with having U.S. personnel and assets there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome\u201d is clearly much less than 100 percent.\n\nAD\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor the State Department would comment on that language, each telling The Fact Checker to discuss it with the other agency.\n\nBut if that\u2019s the case, it would make sense, because that has been the arrangement in the past.\n\n\u201cWhen the military first moved to Prince Sultan Air Base in 1996 after Khobar, I helped negotiate the deal,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former CIA official who is now at the Brookings Institution, referring to the Khobar Towers bombing. \u201cThe Saudis agreed to pay for building barracks and other infrastructure for the base, which was their property of course, but made the necessary accommodation suitable for the U.S. Air Force, RAF [Britain\u2019s Royal Air Force] and French aircrews. They did not reimburse any expenses.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRiedel added: \u201cIt is significant that the Pentagon won\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnthony H. Cordesman, the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said: \u201cThere is no formal definition of \u2018burden-sharing,\u2019 and it can include providing facilities and services to the U.S. for free or at a discount, buying arms, barter deals, and direct or indirect cash transfers. There also is no standard reporting or audit requirement, and some programs are classified. Accordingly, the president can say just about anything \u2014 as he does in exaggerating U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nBut he noted that the Saudi government paid for a large part of U.S. operations in the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War. \u201cIt also often pays late but sometimes pays in advance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also may be so concerned about the increasing tendency of the U.S. to withdraw or fail to act that it will try to lock down U.S. support by paying some form of bonus.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt the moment, the Saudis are sitting on a large unpaid bill. In September, Defense News reported that the Saudis still owed the Pentagon $181 million for midair refueling assistance for its bombing runs over Yemen.\n\nAD\n\nCmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a Pentagon spokeswoman, indicated that the Saudis have made some progress toward paying the outstanding bill. \u201cThe process of reimbursement is continuing, and we continue to expect full reimbursement of refueling expenses,\u201d she told The Fact Checker. \u201cI am not going to be able to provide specifics on the reimbursement process.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nAfter years of listening to Trump, we suspect that there may be a grain of truth here but that it\u2019s highly exaggerated. It\u2019s certainly fishy that no one in the administration appears willing to explain what, if anything, has been negotiated. And we certainly can\u2019t accept it based on the president\u2019s rhetoric, which has proven so wrong about his deals with Saudi Arabia in the past.\n\nAD\n\nBased on the available evidence, we are going to label this with Three Pinocchios. If more information is eventually forthcoming, we will update this fact check and possibly the Pinocchio rating as well.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles", "description": "The president says Saudi Arabia will pay \"100 percent\" of the cost of U.S. troops dispatched to the kingdom.
