It will be discussed next Wednesday in Strasbourg, after which it will be formally voted on.\n\nMEPs reserve their strongest condemnation for the Home Secretary's bungled announcements on free movement. Ms Patel announced on 19 August that she wanted to end free movement as soon as the UK left the EU, but U-turned on 1 September less than two weeks later after it emerged the policy was completely impractical.\n\nThe parliament \"expresses its grave concern that recent and conflicting announcements by the Home Office in relation to free movement after 31 October 2019 have generated very unhelpful uncertainty for EU citizens resident in the UK, with the risk that those announcement may exacerbate the hostile environment towards them as well as impacting negatively on their ability to enforce their rights\".\n\nThe wide-ranging seven-page resolution, which is understood to have been drawn up in consultation with Michel Barnier's Brexit team, covers other areas of policy as well.\n\nOn the British government's attitude to negotiations, MEPs warn: \"It appears the UK government has made planning for no-deal its main policy priority and some of the members of the UK government believe that a no-deal exit would be the optimal outcome\".\n\nIt also says that the government's decision to suspend parliament \u2013 declared unlawful in the courts on Wednesday \u2013 \"makes the possibility of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU without an agreement more likely\".\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The notoriously incompetent department had falsely claimed that applicants only needed a passport or ID card to complete the application - when in fact many applications require significantly more documentation.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Nobody has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered, and declining, the opportunity to submit evidence that they qualify for settled status.\n\n\"More than 1 million people have been granted status through the EU Settlement Scheme so far and two thirds of those have been granted settled status, which is in line with our expectations.\u201d", "description": "The Home Office is making the \"hostile environment\" worse for EU citizens ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union, the European Parliament is to warn.
