It was what drove Collins to watch hours of the former Redskins safety on YouTube, what led him to declare to his father that Taylor was the player he wanted to model his game after.\n\nIt was why, after all these years, Collins still has the gift he received from his dad in middle school: Taylor\u2019s University of Miami jersey.\n\nWhat made Collins so obsessed? He watched Taylor hit.\n\n\u201cYou hear kids now that\u2019s in the NBA saying if it wasn\u2019t for Michael Jordan, they wouldn\u2019t know how to play the game,\u201d Thomas Collins, Landon\u2019s father, told The Washington Times. \u201cI can see a lot of Landon, especially coming up, (emulate) the way Sean Taylor hit, the way he comes down is the same way Landon do it.\u201d\n\nSince Collins signed a six-year, $84 million deal with the Redskins in free agency, coaches and teammates alike have been impressed by the safety\u2019s sure-handed, bone-jarring tackles. Like Taylor, Collins always seems to be in the right place at the right time to punish ball carriers and receivers.\n\nOn Sunday, Collins gets the opportunity to administer some of that punishment to his former team as the Redskins travel to take on the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium.\n\nCollins\u2018 tenure with the Giants did not end on a good note. The 25-year-old has blasted Giants general manager Dave Gettleman in interviews over the last few months, telling reporters he \u201csaw the difference\u201d in how players were treated after Gettleman replaced former GM Jerry Reese in 2017.\n\nFor Collins, Sunday\u2019s matchup is intensely personal \u2014 something the Redskins don\u2019t mind.\n\nThe safety\u2019s fiery demeanor is one reason the team pursued Collins in the offseason. Twice a year, the Redskins saw up-close how Collins wrecked plays at the line of scrimmage, chased down receivers in the open field and made game-changing plays.\n\nCollins plays with a chip on his shoulder.\n\n\u201cWe wanted him,\u201d coach Jay Gruden told New York media on a conference call, \u201cbecause he was a pain in the (butt) with the Giants.\u201d\n\nEven in an era when the NFL has skewed the rules to protect players \u2014 or benefit offenses, as defenders would argue \u2014 Collins is able to impose his physicality. Since being drafted in 2015, the three-time Pro Bowler leads all defensive backs in tackles with 455 \u2014 66 more than the next defender, Rams safety Mark Baron.\n\nIn that span, Collins has only drawn four unnecessary roughness penalties \u2014 the hits are hard, but clean.\n\nSo what makes Collins such an effective tackler? Is it the ferocity or is it the accuracy?\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s both,\u201d running back Chris Thompson said. \u201cHe takes great angles. His feet are good. For him, it\u2019s really all about angles. He\u2019s a big, strong compact dude, so if he gets your hands on you, for the most part, you\u2019re not going to get away from him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just vicious the way he plays the game.\u201d\n\nThompson would know, having faced him in the NFC East for four years. He said players have to make \u201cbusiness decisions\u201d when seeing Collins, either by going out of bounds or bracing themselves for the hit.\n\nTight end Vernon Davis said Collins has a \u201cpresence\u201d on the field other players take note of.\n\nOn a disappointing Redskins defense, Collins has been a standout.\n\nIn three games, Collins has a team-high 27 tackles \u2014 20 unassisted.\n\nThomas Collins said he always felt his son was suited to playing defense. Growing up in Louisiana, Collins played both running back and linebacker, but switched primarily to defense in high school.\n\n\u201cLandon was about eight years old \u2026 and a guy said, \u2018Man, look at him playing defense, I didn\u2019t know Landon could play defense like that,\u2019\u201d Thomas Collins said. \u201cI said, \u2018When he gets older, I think, the other side of the ball is where he\u2019s going to be.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe intuition turned out to be right. And the Redskins are surely glad the switch was made.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
