The games were not televised in China after relations between the NBA and Chinese officials became strained following Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nOne sign was aimed at LeBron James and Nets owner Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, who were critical of Morey\u2019s tweet. Tsai wrote a Facebook post explaining why the since-deleted tweet was upsetting to the Chinese.\n\nNets guard Kyrie Irving said he understood why the protesters came to the game.\n\n\u201cI think that when you think about communities across the world, I think that a lot of people would stand for world peace,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernment gets involved and impacts different communities in different ways. The reality is that as individuals it\u2019s our job to stand up for what we believe in. I understand Hong Kong and China is dealing with their issues respectively, but there\u2019s enough oppression and stuff going on in America for me not to be involved in the community issues here as well.\u201d", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A group of fans held signs, wore shirts and chanted support for Hong Kong and Tibet in the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 first game", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Sarah-Stier1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
