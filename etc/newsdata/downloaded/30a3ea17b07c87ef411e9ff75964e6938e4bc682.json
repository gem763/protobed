Police said Ramirez-Cayente picked up Calderon, who offered him sex before she was allegedly shot by the illegal alien.\n\nThough Ramirez-Cayente admitted to shooting Calderon six times, Judge Hal Turley set the illegal alien\u2019s bond at $25,000 and did not order that he wear an ankle monitor if he was released from custody. Before the District Attorney\u2019s Office could step in, according to the Dallas Morning News, Ramirez-Cayente had already been released with no ankle monitor, and his whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed that Ramirez-Cayente is in the U.S. illegally and had previously been deported in March 2010 after he was caught crossing the southern border.\n\n\u201cICE urges anyone with information regarding Ramirez-Cayente\u2019s location in the United States to contact their local ICE office,\u201d an official told the Dallas Morning News.\n\nIn a Dallas Morning News profile of Calderon and the attack, the transgender detailed how he is traumatized from the attack, which he says occurred after the illegal alien discovered he was transgender.\n\nCalderon said he was working the street as a prostitute when Ramirez-Cayente pulled up in a red truck and the two negotiated a price for oral sex. Soon after, Calderon said Ramirez-Cayente asked why he talked in a deep voice, prompting him to tell him that he was transgender.\n\nAfter telling him that he was no longer interested, Calderon said the illegal alien left to go to a nearby shop. The illegal returned from behind and shot Calderon six times in the hip, abdomen, arm, and chest.\n\nWhen police arrived at the scene, they found Calderon laying on the ground in a pool of blood and he was rushed to a nearby hospital where emergency responders were able to save his life.\n\n\u201cHe did it without remorse,\u201d Calderon said of Ramirez-Cayente. \u201cHe will do it again.\u201d\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
