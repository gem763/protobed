REUTERS/Gwladys Fouche/File Photo\n\nReporting a 1.6% return on investment in the third quarter, Yngve Slyngstad also told a news conference that the fund does not plan to invest in Saudi Aramco when the oil company carries out its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO).\n\nSlyngstad, 56, has been with the fund for 22 years and has held the top job since January 2008. He invested heavily during the stock market meltdown soon afterwards and has overseen a fivefold rise in asset values while in charge.\n\nHe will take up a new job with the fund, based in London, where he will build a unit to invest in \u201cunlisted infrastructure projects\u201d such as wind power and other renewable energy.\n\nThe leadership change is likely to be \u201cin a few quarters\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving, I\u2019m taking a different role in the fund. I think it\u2019s a good time for the leadership change,\u201d Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference. \u201cAny day is an arbitrary day, but why not at this stage, when everything is aligned both in terms of the strategy and the size of the fund.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, which saves revenues from Norway\u2019s oil and gas industry for future generations, last Friday hit a record value of 10 trillion Norwegian crowns (\u00a3841 billion).\n\nBut the fund has at times met political resistance, including over moves to diversify away from oil - parliament rejected its 2017 proposal to divest all oil and gas stocks.\n\nIn the end, the initiative was watered down to only include a sale of pure-play upstream explorers, leaving integrated oil majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP Plc (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) in the portfolio.\n\nSlyngstad said the interference was not a reason for his resignation.\n\n\u201cNo, we have a clear mandate from the Ministry of Finance, it\u2019s very well defined what our role is. It\u2019s well defined by the board of how we are going to execute the strategy plans which update regularly, so my role first of all is execution,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated Coverage Norway's sovereign wealth fund CEO Slyngstad to step down\n\nFinance Minister Siv Jensen said in a statement to Reuters: \u201cHe has done a tremendous job, delivering results that will benefit us all for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nCentral bank Governor Oeystein Olsen, who will lead the process of recruiting a replacement, said political interference comes with the job.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a strength to operate that kind of fund in a democracy with our kind of politicians. They\u2019ve made good decisions over the years, and deserve credit for the overall management of the fund,\u201d Olsen said.\n\nTHIRD-QUARTER BOOSTED BY U.S. INVESTMENTS\n\nThe fund made a 1.6% return on investment in the third quarter, earning 236 billion Norwegian crowns, it said earlier.\n\n\u201cEquity and fixed income investments had another quarter with positive returns,\u201d Slyngstad said. \u201cWe saw a particularly positive contribution from U.S. treasuries and North American stocks, which returned 4.6% and 2.9% respectively.\u201d\n\nThe return for the quarter was in line with the fund\u2019s benchmark index, it said.\n\nWith a population of less than 5.4 million, the Norwegian fund\u2019s quarterly return works out at almost $4,800 per citizen.\n\nIt invests Norway\u2019s oil and gas revenue in foreign stocks, bonds and real estate, but investment in Saudi Aramco is not in its sights.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia is not part of our reference index,\u201d Slyngstad said.\n\nThe fund has some smaller investments in Saudi companies through an emerging markets portfolio, but a major company such as Aramco would not be a natural part of this portfolio, he said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Norwegian sovereign wealth fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad in Oslo, Norway, June 2, 2017.
