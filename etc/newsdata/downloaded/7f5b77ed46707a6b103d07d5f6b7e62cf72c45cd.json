They've already proven they have no interest in giving Trump his due process. While they proceed with the inquiry, real work is being neglected, Republicans charged on Tuesday. Work on behalf of our brave military.\n\n\u201cThe people that are hurting are the American public because of the work that is not being done in Congress today,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe funding of our troops, the funding of government, prescription drug prices, our trade, our strength to our economy, can all get done if they\u2019d only focus on the work of why they were elected.\u201d\n\nCongress has 20 days of military funding left, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) reminded his Democratic colleagues. This is no time to hold that funding hostage, particularly after the successful raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cHow can you justify praising the military but then not voting to give them the resources they need to do their job?\u201d he asked.\n\nBut Democrats are bringing in more witnesses this week as part of their inquiry. Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a purple heart recipient, is expected to testify on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. He was the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council and reportedly had concerns about something he heard during President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The whistleblower complaint against Trump accused him of quid pro quo, threatening to withhold military aid from Ukraine if the government did not honor his request to investigate Joe Biden.\n\n\"I thank him for his service,\" McCarthy said of Vindman. \"I thank him for his commitment to this country. But he is wrong.\"\n\nMcCarthy stressed that \"the entire world has the transcripts\" of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Zelensky and can see for themselves that there's no evidence of quid pro quo.\n\n\"Nothing in that phone call is impeachable.\"\n\nThe Democrats, McCarthy said, \"have put America through a two-year nightmare.\"", "description": ".10/29/2019 20:00:48PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/60/1dc830bb-7654-46e6-aad1-79b4a1bad22f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
