And that is by his family and friends. Roger Stone, of all people, refers to him as \u201cone of the most controversial people in the country.\u201d\n\nSo what does it say, then, that at one of the most vexing, stressful, and nearly impeachable moments in his presidency, it is reported that Donald Trump called out to his aides, \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d\n\nAt a moment of crisis, Trump cried out for his former friend, personal lawyer, and fixer. Some might characterize it as the president attempting to summon a demon.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s curious about what makes a monster,\u201d says Matt Tyrnauer, the director of the new documentary that takes its name from that incident, Where\u2019s My Roy Cohn? In the film, which will be released Friday, audiences get two origin stories for the price of one.\n\nBefore he died of complications from AIDS in 1986, Cohn lived a life of such public infamy that a rundown of his most notorious acts would more believably describe the arch villain of a comic series were they not so horrifically real, and the repercussions not so deeply felt.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

Thus was birthed his reputation as a lawyer who could literally strap someone to an electric chair.\n\nHe would later serve, as one former colleague calls it, as \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s handmaiden,\u201d the right-hand man to Joseph McCarthy\u2019s Communist witch hunt in the 1950s. As he got older, he would become a fixture among New York\u2019s richest and, by extension, most corrupt. He was a power broker for both the underworld and the legitimate political world, standing on the bridge between mobsters and crime bosses and the politicians and businessmen who dealt with them.\n\nHis lack of scruples would become the stuff of legend and, among the benefactors of his pugnacious ways, reverence, as he surrounded himself with media moguls, stars, and the most prominent people in the country, including the Reagans.\n\nHis hypocrisy would also prove prolific, as dramatized in Tony Kushner\u2019s seminal play, Angels in America. He started his career by persecuting gay government employees while living as a closeted gay man himself. His voracious sexual appetite was fabled: a different partner each day, according to some rumors. He denied that he was gay and that he had contracted AIDS until his dying day, though he happily accepted the Reagans\u2019 assistance in getting him experimental treatment for the disease.\n\nThen there\u2019s the reason for revisiting all this at all: a fateful meeting with Donald Trump at New York\u2019s Le Club when Trump was 23. He hired Cohn to represent him against a lawsuit alleging that his real estate company was barring black New Yorkers from living in its buildings. Trump settled, adopting the chief rule in the Cohn playbook for himself: Never admit you\u2019re wrong, and never apologize.\n\nThe story is that Cohn would coach Trump in how to keep authorities off his track while engaging in shady business dealings, and how to manipulate the media while embroiled in controversy: If all else fails, start blaming and bullying other people. More, Cohn\u2019s fame proved you could cast yourself as a lovable scoundrel and the media would in turn cast you as a star.\n\n\u201cRoy Cohn created a president from beyond the grave,\u201d Tyrnauer says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an absurd statement to make, but in this case is true. With the election of Trump, Cohn goes from being a footnote in American history to being a modern Machiavelli, which is an astonishing phenomenon.\u201d\n\nIt also should be a cautionary tale.\n\n\u201cTrump is a symptom of the darkest tendencies in our populace to take advantage of a system and exploit it for personal gain rather than the greater good,\u201d Tyrnauer says. \u201cThat this country was capable of electing him president and not systematically rejecting him is a really terrifying thing.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re speaking over lunch at the Nomad Hotel several days before Where\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\u2019s official release. The last time we spoke was before the release of his last documentary, Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood, about a 95-year-old former gigolo who once operated a brothel out of a gas station and claimed to have slept with dozens of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, including bombshell revelations about Cary Grant and Spencer Tracy.\n\nTyrnauer appears a bit more weathered this go-round, at least emotionally, having consigned his last year to what he refers to as the \u201cmiasma of uncleanliness\u201d of Cohn\u2019s life. Now he\u2019s standing shell-shocked in the aftermath of that deleteriousness. The world as we know it today. Trump\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cTo understand the flaws in our system and the national psyche that could give rise to someone like [Trump] is of deep importance,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made this movie, so you could see the cartographer of Trump\u2019s map. If you understand the methods to the madness, there will be more of a chance of eradicating those tendencies going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201c To understand the flaws in our system and the national psyche that could give rise to someone like [Trump] is of deep importance. \u201d\n\nMany described Cohn as a mentor to Trump. Some have gone as far as to refer to him as Trump\u2019s surrogate father. Tyrnauer says he was shocked by how many people he interviewed who point-blank said that Donald Trump is Roy Cohn. \u201cAnother person said Donald Trump swallowed Roy Cohn whole.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn? isn\u2019t a documentary about Donald Trump. Cohn\u2019s relationship with him is overtly referenced for only a brief portion of the film, which chronicles Cohn\u2019s entire life, though the impact Cohn had on the current political system is obliquely referenced throughout. Without hitting you over the head with it, then, Where\u2019s My Roy Cohn? is a documentary about Donald Trump\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cIf there's any silver lining to all of this, it's that it has exposed the dark side of our political system, which in the wake of the civil rights movement and Watergate really was driven underground,\u201d Tyrnauer says. \u201cThe paranoid style of American politics and the specter of dirty politics, we're always vaguely aware of it. But we never thought that it would rise up again and be so above ground.\u201d\n\nWith everything that was known about Trump, his actions, and his character, he was still elected. \u201cWe know that among the electorate, approximately 40 percent will vote for a dangerous demagogue, an incompetent man,\u201d Tyrnauer says. \u201cThat\u2019s actually helpful information. What we do about it is the question.\u201d\n\nTrump and Cohn are cut from the same cloth, a master and his student\u2014a student who some argue has outclassed his teacher.\n\n\u201c Roy Cohn created a president from beyond the grave. \u201d\n\n\u201cThey're narcissistic, selfish, self-interested, mob-adjacent gangsters who are so effective at manipulating to positions of power that they end up affecting all of our lives,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we don't pay attention to those people and their skills and we don't move to eradicate them from public life, we're in very, very deep trouble. It seems like the guardrails of democracy are much more fragile than we ever thought they were.\u201d\n\nJust months prior to his death, Cohn was disbarred for ethical violations. Barbara Walters, William F. Buckley Jr., and Trump himself were among the dozens of high-society folk who spoke as character witnesses on his behalf. From politicians to media figures, the people who should have been keeping a watchful eye on him and exposing him were instead cavorting with him on his yacht, in the Hamptons, and at dinner parties\u2014certainly a recognizable dynamic today, whether you are talking about Trump or the Jeffrey Epsteins of the world.\n\nTyrnauer relays with disgust the number of liberal people he interviewed for the film in New York who had personal dealings with Cohn and argued that his magnetic personality and loyalty justified their acquaintance with him in spite of the Rosenbergs, in spite of McCarthy, in spite of his hypocrisy in persecuting gay people, in spite of the corporate malfeasance, in spite of Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the film, he interviews one of Cohn\u2019s former colleagues, who says, \u201cRoy was responsible, according to Roy, for everything important that happens in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people back in his day would have thought that was hyperbole, but now unfortunately I think it\u2019s proven to be true,\u201d Tyrnauer says, smiling and offering what may be his only praise of Roy Cohn in the hour that we meet: \u201cThat\u2019s quite a trick from 33 years beyond the grave.\u201d", "description": "The documentary \u201cWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\u201d looks back at one of America\u2019s most notorious demagogues, who was also Donald Trump\u2019s mentor\u2014and maybe the reason he\u2019s president today.", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568857677/190918-fallon-roy-cohen-tease_iucv3m", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
