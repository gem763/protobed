REUTERS/Dan Riedlhuber/File Photo\n\nCALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc called on Canada\u2019s energy regulator on Wednesday to ignore calls from some of its shippers and avoid intervening in the pipeline company\u2019s contentious proposal to revamp contracts on its Mainline network.\n\nThe written submission to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) is the latest salvo in a dispute between Calgary-based Enbridge and some of Canada\u2019s biggest oil companies over the future of the Mainline network.\n\nThe Mainline is North America\u2019s biggest pipeline system and ships the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States. It currently allocates capacity according to monthly nominations from shippers, and Enbridge is proposing to switch to long-term fixed-volume contracts on 90% of the pipeline.\n\nEnbridge launched a two-month open season to solicit bids for committed capacity on Aug. 2 but shippers including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor Energy complained the terms and tolls on offer were unfair and urged the regulator to intervene in the open season.\n\nThe CER agreed to hold a fast-track process to gather comment. Last week 33 interested parties including the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers waded into the dispute, laying out their support or opposition to Enbridge\u2019s plans.\n\nIn its answering letter, Enbridge said the CER should avoid taking the unprecedented step of intervening in a pipeline open season. Instead the CER should stick to the usual practice of holding a regulatory review of the terms and tolls offered, once Enbridge makes a formal application at the end of the year.\n\nBy intervening early \u201cthis process would delay business, impose considerable regulatory burden on all parties, and require the regulator to micro-manage service offerings,\u201d Enbridge said in the letter.\n\nEnbridge also argued the regulator had no authority to halt the open season, as some shippers have called for. The pipeline company said it had tried to \u201cstrike a balance\u201d between its own position and the different positions of stakeholders, some of whom had asked for the Mainline to switch to firm service contracts to give more certainty on capacity and tolls.\n\nReferring to last week\u2019s submissions to the CER, Enbridge said companies that filed letters in support of their proposal ship approximately 30% of crude volumes on the Mainline, while those that filed letters in opposition made up 20% of volumes.", "description": "Enbridge Inc called on Canada's energy regulator on Wednesday to ignore calls from some of its shippers and avoid intervening in the pipeline company's contentious proposal to revamp contracts on its Mainline network.", "authors": ["Nia Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428818490&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A1U7-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
