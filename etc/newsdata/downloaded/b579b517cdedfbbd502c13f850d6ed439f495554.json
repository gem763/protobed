REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - Iran offered on Saturday to engage Syrian Kurds, Syria\u2019s government and Turkey in talks to establish security along the Turkish-Syrian border following Turkey\u2019s military incursion into northern Syria to fight Kurdish forces.\n\nIn making the mediation offer, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referred to a 21-year-old security accord that required Damascus to stop harboring Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) militants waged an insurgency against the Turkish state. Turkey has said that pact was never implemented.\n\n\u201cThe Adana Agreement between Turkey and Syria - still valid - can be the better path to achiev(ing) security,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cIran can help bring together the Syrian Kurds, the Syrian Govt and Turkey so that the Syrian Army together with Turkey can guard the border,\u201d he said in a tweet which carried part of an interview he conducted with Turkish state broadcaster TRT.\n\nIran\u2019s call came on the fourth day of Turkey\u2019s offensive against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara regards as a terrorist group with links to the PKK.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its efforts to persuade Ankara to halt the incursion, saying Ankara was causing \u201cgreat harm\u201d to ties and could face sanctions.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday the 1998 accord could only be implemented if there was a political settlement to Syria\u2019s eight-year-old war. He also said implementing the Adana pact would require the Syrian government to be in control of northeastern Syria - which it is not.\n\nIran, a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has regularly urged Turkey to respect Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and avoid military action in northeastern Syria.\n\nDamascus has said it is committed to the Adana accord.", "description": "Iran offered on Saturday to engage Syrian Kurds, Syria's government and Turkey in talks to establish security along the Turkish-Syrian border following Turkey's military incursion into northern Syria to fight Kurdish forces.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440006933&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0BK", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
