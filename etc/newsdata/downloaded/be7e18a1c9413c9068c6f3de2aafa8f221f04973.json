Nauseeff, president and CEO of JobsOhio, the state\u2019s economic development organization, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move, \u201cOhio is at full employment and we\u2019re even adding manufacturing jobs.\u201d He said that the state is also diversifying the economy and introducing health innovation.\n\nIn April 2009, the state ranked 8th for the highest unemployment rate across the United States at 10.2%, trailing not too far behind states like Nevada, North Carolina and Carolina. Since then companies like Root Insurance and CoverMyMeds, have created headquarters in the midwestern state. Nauseeff attributes Ohio\u2019s location, cost of living and workforce to the company\u2019s decision to choose Ohio as a home base.\n\n\u201cSome of these businesses might get their invention or their first capital in a larger market, but to scale, you can scale affordably\u201d in Ohio, Naueeff said, \u201cYou can find diversity in the industries, diversity in the communities. We\u2019re not dominated by one or two large cities, we have some large cities, but we have small towns and a relatively low cost of living so it\u2019s really a great place for families.\u201d He also makes note of the two hundred institutions of higher learning available statewide, like Ohio State, that are allowing the opportunity \u201cfor people to get educated and for employers to invest if they want a strong workforce.\u201d\n\nBut keep in mind, it\u2019s not new that major companies are flocking to Ohio to set up a home base. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Big Lots (BIG), Eaton Corporation (ETN) Good Year (GT), L Brands, Inc. (LB), Macy\u2019s (M), Kroger (KR), Procter & Gamble (PG), The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW), among many others, have headquarters in major cities, including Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and New Albany, across the state.\n\nOhio reaches unemployment rate of 4.1% in September of 2019.

Each year, the overall industry brings in $105 billion dollars to Ohio\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIn pockets, there have been some impacts in agriculture,\u201d Nauseeff said. \u201cFor instance, the soybean (S=F) market.\u201d Each year soybean production brings in nearly $5.3 billion dollars for the overall economy statewide. Nauseeff also noted that \u201ccompanies like Cargill are investing in infrastructure that uses soybeans as byproduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing some changes to our investment pipeline that would indicate that importing, raw materials and manufacturing are slowing down a bit and just assembly is occurring because of the nature of the negotiation on the tariffs and how all those impact the raw materials,\u201d he said.\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a producer for Yahoo Finance.
