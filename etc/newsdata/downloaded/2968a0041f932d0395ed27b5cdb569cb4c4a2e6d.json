But when it comes to the overarching goal for ultra-high net worth families\u2014to sustain wealth through generations\u2014those tools aren\u2019t enough. What\u2019s also needed is a deep dive into a family\u2019s culture, relationships, and values to put in place customized systems of education and governance.\n\nWith so much at stake for wealthy families, last year Arne Boudewyn, a licensed clinical psychologist, launched the Institute for Family Culture within Abbot Downing to focus solely on addressing non-traditional, nuanced financial services for wealthy clients. As managing director, he describes the institute\u2019s function as part think tank and part consulting firm.\n\nHe recently took time to chat with Penta about his work.\n\nPENTA : Absent systems of education and governance within families, how might things go wrong?\n\nArne Boudewyn: Every family is subject to communication breakdowns, family lawsuits, a poorly-prepared heir that loses money. I meet wealth inheritors in their 50s and 60s whose parents haven\u2019t told them what\u2019s in their estate plan. The worst thing that can happen is to have great wealth in poorly prepared hands.\n\nThink about the folks who marry into families\u2014things can go wrong when families don\u2019t do an adequate job of onboarding. Not including someone in discussions can create conflict and generations can inherit that conflict. Communication and trust are key to keeping a family together and keeping assets together.\n\nThese days, most advisors to wealthy families work on governance and related issues. Why did you create a separate unit to handle these issues?\n\nBecause our clients were asking for these services but a lot of advisors don\u2019t have the training or feel comfortable delving into them. Our clients were getting advice in every other aspect\u2014banking, investing, trusts\u2014but were asking, \u201cWhat do I do with my family and the enormous wealth I\u2019ve created?\u201d\n\nTo do this work takes time and focus, so we thought, why not create a group that looks at things holistically?\n\nCan you take us under the hood of the Institute?\n\nWe have a team of 15 that sits in New York, Scottsdale, San Francisco, Chicago, and Southern California. It consists of psychologists, historians and people with advanced degrees in mental health. We recruit from academia because we find people have the proper training. For example, in psychology, there has been an emerging field of wealth psychology. We have mental health professionals who had wealthy clients in their private practices or have done research on the wealth impact on families.\n\nWhat\u2019s an example of a problem you helped a family with recently?\n\nWe work with a four-generation family with a massive business worth a billion, at least. In the second generation, there are 13 cousins and siblings but only one person was working in the business.\n\nWe looked at the fact that there was no clear next-generation education program. Maybe there was a pathway for other family members into the business? We helped start a family council that met monthly, set up an agenda, run the calls. Now, four times a year they have a family meeting to talk about the financial health of the business, the trust structure, and opportunities for educating the kids.\n\nWhat are the core topics you cover with families?\n\nThe institute is held up by four pillars. There\u2019s the family and business history pillar, in which we help families discover or rediscover important family stories about their ancestors\u2014about entrepreneurship, resilience in the face of diversity\u2014and encourage them to tell and retell them. This can help the younger generations who may feel disconnected.\n\nThen there\u2019s the family dynamics, education, and governance pillar, which at its core is helping families develop communication and decision-making strategies.\n\nAnd there\u2019s family business transitions. You have to think about how you transfer ownership in a business to the next generation.\n\nThe last pillar is social impact. We help families defining their impact through philanthropy and align investments with their culture and values.\n\nHow does your staff interface with clients?\n\nUsually there is a designated lead working with a family, but we consult with each other. When we\u2019re organizing a family meeting or family retreat, we develop a team.\n\nWhat\u2019s an example of a creative way you\u2019ve worked with a family?\n\nWe recently had an event with one family with 44 family members, ages 5 to 85. We framed it as a three-day family retreat. It kicked off with four different narratives about the family history, such as who the most important women were in the family history, about adversity and hardship when the family moved west in 1800, and important stories about recent grandparents. We got kids to put a skit together with costumes. There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house.\n\nHow did you address the different needs of the family members over three days?\n\nWe had sessions on communication styles, on parenting, and on family counsel\u2014what\u2019s working and not working. We had a program for the younger kids called Time, Talent, and Treasure, which was experiential hands-on learning about being philanthropic. They stuffed care bears and dropped them off at a Ronald McDonald House.\n\nMeanwhile we had individual meetings with each couple so they could talk about wealth issues and about the kids and their issues. This is a family where so many are trustees of other peoples\u2019 trusts, and they didn\u2019t know what that meant, so we worked on that, too.\n\nWe held the retreat at Disney World, so each day when the meetings ended, there was something to look forward to for the kids.\n\nFamilies can potentially learn from each other, but talking about money is often taboo. Do you facilitate connections or support between families?\n\nWe do a rising generation summit conference every year with about 40 millennial stakeholders between ages 25 and 35 over two days. They spend time hearing about venture capital, technology, social impact, and participate in sessions together on wealth and relationships. We do fundamentals of investing and banking, and a lot of sessions led by millennials themselves about what it means to be a wealth steward. The sharing across the millennials is amazing. It\u2019s pure magic.\n\nWhen you were studying for your doctorate degree in psychology, did you ever think you would end up working for a financial services firm?\n\nI never did at all. I\u2019m still a licensed clinical psychologist. My dad was in banking for 35 years and we laugh now because it turns out the apple didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.", "description": "The licensed clinical psychologist focuses on addressing non-traditional, nuanced financial services for wealthy clients", "authors": ["Karen Hube"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-114479/social", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
