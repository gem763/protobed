One official said the president was inside a building when the bomb exploded on a motorcycle just outside. Many of the dead were civilians, hospital officials said.\n\nThe campaign season so far has labored under threat from Taliban insurgents, and from the uncertainty surrounding the collapse of negotiations between Taliban and American officials on the eve of an agreement on a troop withdrawal schedule.\n\nIn July, Mr. Ghani\u2019s first vice president, Amrullah Saleh, narrowly escaped a complex attack featuring a car bomb and a half-dozen suicide bombers on his political headquarters in Kabul.", "description": "The blast narrowly missed Mr. Ghani, officials said.
