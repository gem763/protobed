The new feature is planned for release in beta in the week of October 21st.\n\nRemote Play Together has the potential to open local multiplayer games up to a much wider audience, by making them playable to anyone who doesn\u2019t have people they can play with nearby. Interestingly, PC Gamer notes the Steamworks page for the new feature says that it will work automatically for \u201call local multiplayer, local co-op and split-screen games,\u201d suggesting that developers will not have to do much, if any, work to make their games compatible.\n\nTo clarify: it really is only for shared-screen or split-screen games. The tech is streaming your screen to your friend and capturing their input and sending it back to the game, so you are both playing the same game, looking at the same thing. \u2014 Alden Kroll GCAP / PAX Australia (@aldenkroll) October 10, 2019\n\nAccording to Valve\u2019s Alden Kroll, who confirmed the existence of the new feature on Twitter, Remote Play Together works by streaming a host\u2019s screen to a second player. It then captures the second player\u2019s input, and sends it back to the game running on the host\u2019s machine.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen a company attempt such a feature. Nvidia previously offered a co-op feature with a game streaming service called GameStream co-op, and Sony allows similar functionality through the PS4\u2019s Share Play service. It\u2019s a challenging feature to pull off, however. If one person is playing a game locally while another has to stream it, the first player won\u2019t have to deal with the added lag of streaming a game over the internet, giving them a potentially massive advantage in any competitive games.", "description": "Steam is preparing to launch a new feature called \"Remote Play Together,\" which will let you play local multiplayer games over the internet.
