In a documentary aired last night called Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, Meghan was emotional as she revealed she hasn't been coping very well with the intense scrutiny she's received over the past few months.\n\nPlus, Prince Harry announced in a heartfelt statement earlier this month that he and Meghan would be suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing a personal letter between Meghan and her dad, Thomas Markle.\n\nSo it's fair to say that the couple are in desperate need of some time to themselves - and apparently they're planning six weeks away from royal duty to get it. A royal source told the Sunday Times, \u201cThe Duke and Duchess have a full schedule of engagements and commitments until mid-November, after which they will be taking some much needed family time.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Max Mumby/Indigo - Getty Images More\n\nDuring their break, the couple will be \"dividing their time between the US and the UK\". They're planning to fly to the US with their son for the first time, where Archie will be celebrating Thanksgiving in Los Angeles with Meghan's mum Doria Ragland.\n\nHowever, the Sussexes will make their way back to England for Christmas with the Queen.\n\nExclusive: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will take some \u201cfamily time\u201d off from November, dividing their time between the US and the UK. It will be Archie\u2019s debut in America where he\u2019s likely to spend his first Thanksgiving. But Christmas will be with the Queen @thesundaytimes pic.twitter.com/8V2T0IPnmo \u2014 Roya Nikkhah (@RoyaNikkhah) October 19, 2019\n\nThe duke and duchess aren't planning to leave royal duties for good, although Harry admitted in last night's documentary that he hopes that the majority of their work will be outside of the UK going forward.\n\n\u201cThe rest of our lives, especially our life's work will be predominantly focused on Africa, on conservation,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don't know where we could live in Africa at the moment. We've just come from Cape Town, that would be an amazing place for us to be able to to base ourselves, of course it would. But with all the problems that are going on there, I just don't see how we would be able to really make as much difference as we'd want to.\u201d\n\nHere's hoping the family manages to settle and finally feel content.\n\nHarry & Meghan: An African Journey is available to watch now on ITV Hub.\n\nFollow Abbi on Instagram.\n\nLike this article?
