Yet the latest court order shared with Cointelegraph on Oct. 19 states that the hearing will be held on Feb. 18\u201319, 2020:\n\n\u201cIT IS ORDERED that Defendants shall not offer, sell, deliver, or distribute \u201cGrams\u201d to any person or entity, until the conclusion of the hearing scheduled by the Court for February 18 and 19, 2020 (\u201cHearing\u201d), except upon further order of the Court or agreement of the parties. At the Hearing, any party may move the Court for the continuation or dissolution of this Order.\u201d\n\nRecently, the SEC has claimed that not only did Telegram violate the U.S. securities laws during its initial coin offering (ICO), but it also is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent Telegram from further violations.\n\nThe SEC stated that Telegram\u2019s proposal to deny the injunction would allow them to continue to violate regulations after five months, and put the burden on the SEC to seek another temporary restraining order.\n\nThe SEC intervened just before TON\u2019s launch\n\nThe SEC has announced an emergency action against Telegram on Oct. 11, just weeks before the planned launch of the Telegram Open Network.\n\nTelegram asked a U.S. court to deny the action, prompting a response from the SEC seeking a preliminary injunction.\n\nWhile Telegram has proposed to postpone the launch of TON, a \u201cforce majeure\u201d clause in the purchase agreement for TON\u2019s native Gram tokens has made investors concerned that Telegram could abandon its obligations to return funds from Gram token sales in the event of a delay.\n\nTelegram investors must decide whether to extend the TON launch by Oct. 23. Should such a proposal pass, TON would tentatively launch on April 30.", "description": "New York District Court postpones the hearing regarding the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s injunction filing against Telegram Open Network", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMGUzMjQ3YWYyYmE2Y2QxYTQ3YTQ4ODk3OTQxZjFiYmIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
