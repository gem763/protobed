In heated exchanges at a presidential debate here Thursday night, 10 Democratic contenders laid bare the party\u2019s deep divisions on major issues including health care, immigration and foreign policy during a debate that also featured personal swipes over honesty, mental acuity and the legacy of former president Barack Obama.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden began Thursday\u2019s presidential debate with an aggressive defense of his health-care proposal, attacking the more expensive and ambitious Medicare-for-all program backed by his top rivals in the Democratic race.\n\nBiden, flanked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), went on offense early against the two liberal candidates, casting their universal health-care program as unworkable, too costly and a betrayal of Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.\n\n\u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Biden said, turning toward Warren. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\nBiden stressed that he wants to expand on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, rather than replace it with Medicare-for-all, which is estimated to cost more than $30 trillion over 10 years.\n\nSanders and Warren largely joined forces to spar with Biden early in the debate, casting their plans as more properly suited to the major problems of the day.\n\nIn what served as a virtual battle over the soul of the Democratic Party, Thursday\u2019s debate highlighted key questions of whether the party should pursue policies of sweeping change or a more incremental return to normalcy in the wake of President Trump.\n\nSeveral candidates also tried to balance offering praise of Obama with giving themselves space to criticize Biden, who served as Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years.\n\nThe third Democratic debate came at an inflection point in the race, with a narrowing of the field that has started to clarify the campaign as it heads into the fall. The trio at the center of the stage \u2014 Biden, Sanders and Warren \u2014 have consistently held the top places in the polls, with the rest of the candidates trailing far behind and growing increasingly desperate.\n\nBut the lengthy discussion appeared to do little to change the overall contours of the Democratic primary, with few standout moments or major missteps during the course of the nearly three-hour event.\n\nWarren, who has been ascendant in the polls in recent months, spent long stretches without speaking Thursday, and did not end up challenging Biden directly during her first face-to-face debate with the former vice president, who sits atop most polls.\n\nSeveral other candidates were more than willing to take on their fellow Democratic contenders directly, despite beginning the debate saying they wanted to unify the country and highlight the party\u2019s broad unanimity on public policy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bold idea, I think it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) said of Sanders\u2019s health-care bill.\n\n\u201cFor a socialist, you\u2019ve got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I have,\u201d Biden said to Sanders, scoffing at the idea that companies would pay workers more if they had fewer health-care costs.\n\nSanders later criticized Biden for voting for the Iraq War in 2002.\n\nA sharp fault line quickly developed between Biden and former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who took several opportunities to directly challenge the former vice president. Castro questioned Biden\u2019s memory and claimed that Biden was not adequately fulfilling Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro asked Biden, alluding to questions about the 76-year-old\u2019s age and mental acuity. In that exchange, however, Castro was misrepresenting what Biden had said two minutes earlier and Biden had not, in fact, forgotten.\n\nWhen Biden was asked whether the Obama administration was too aggressive with its deportation policies, Biden responded, \u201cThe president did the best thing that he was able to do.\u201d After being pushed on whether he should have done more, Biden responded, \u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States.\u201d\n\nCastro seized on the response, chiding Biden for boasting about the Obama administration successes but distancing himself from its problems.\n\n\u201cEvery time something good about Barack Obama comes up he says, \u2018Oh I was there, I was there, I was there, that\u2019s me, too,\u2019 \u201d Castro said. \u201cAnd then every time somebody questions, or the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president.\u2019 I mean he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer any question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years \u2014 good, bad and indifferent,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cI did not say I did not stand with him.\u201d\n\nFor much of the debate, Democrats spent more time talking about the former president than the current one. Still, Trump loomed large on the debate stage as Democrats pilloried his policies and his behavior in office.\n\n\u201cHouston, we have a problem,\u201d Klobuchar said at the event\u2019s outset, invoking Trump. \u201cWe have a guy there who is literally running our country like a game show. He would rather lie than lead.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News,\u201d Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) said at the end of her opening remarks, which she dedicated to attacking the president for \u201ctrying to sow hate and division.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most dangerous president in the history of this country,\u201d Sanders said of Trump.\n\nFormer congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke called Trump a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and accused him of inspiring the gunman who traveled to El Paso and killed 22 people last month. The White House has called such accusations disingenuous.\n\nTrump campaign officials hosted an event for Hispanic voters in Houston and took out ads in the Houston Chronicle attacking Democrats on issues including taxes, energy and health care.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before the debate Thursday, Trump said he expected Biden, Warren or Sanders to win the Democratic nomination. He said he would not be watching the debate live, because it coincided with his visit to a House Republican retreat in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to watch it as a rerun,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore the debate, a plane funded by the Trump campaign circled above Houston with a banner that read: \u201cSOCIALISM WILL KILL HOUSTON\u2019S ECONOMY! VOTE TRUMP 2020.\u201d\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll released this week showed Trump trailing Biden, Warren, Sanders and Harris by significant margins in a general election. Trump has disputed the poll\u2019s accuracy.\n\nThe debate turned to guns, a topic that has ignited passion among Democrats. Biden, pressed on why he could be trusted to enact major new gun restrictions given his failure to do so as vice president after the 2012 massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., insisted that the political landscape has changed.\n\nBut there are limits to what a president can do, said Biden, who said that assault weapons can\u2019t be eliminated by executive authority, as Harris has proposed.\n\n\u201cI would say, Joe, instead of saying \u2018no we can\u2019t,\u2019 let\u2019s say \u2018yes we can,\u2019 \u201d said Harris, a play on Obama\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be constitutional,\u201d Biden said in response.\n\nO\u2019Rourke touted his plan for a mandatory government buyback of assault weapons. \u201cHell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said.\n\nAndrew Yang, who had forecast that he would do something unique during the debate, said in his opening statement that he would expand a pilot program for his signature plan on universal basic income, which would give all Americans $1,000 per month. He said he would give away $120,000 to 10 families as part of the experiment.\n\nWhile Yang spoke about artificial intelligence and the challenges it would cause in the coming decades, Biden at times sounded out of step with popular culture, imploring parents to make sure their children are stimulated by invoking technologies not in use by many Americans.\n\n\u201cPlay the radio, make sure the TV, excuse me, make sure you have a record player on at night,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMake sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school or a very poor background here for a minute words were spoken by the time they get there.\u201d\n\nBiden, cut off by the moderator, refused to stop speaking like he has in past debates: \u201cI\u2019m going to go on like the rest of them,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was a more aggressive stance compared with the previous two debates, when Biden found himself repeatedly on the defensive.\n\nBiden and his allies have been attempting to cast his record as one that liberals in the party should be proud of and one that is more realistic than the more far-reaching promises offered by Sanders and Warren. They have also attempted to portray Warren as hypocritical for raising money from big donors up until this year during her presidential campaign.\n\nOn Thursday, the vice president began the debates with direct challenges to his top rivals on one of the most divisive issues in the Democratic primary: health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow are we going to pay for it?\u201d Biden asked of the Medicare-for-all plan backed by Sanders. \u201cThis is about candor. Honesty. Big ideas.\u201d\n\nSeveral candidates tried to balance offering praise of Obama with giving themselves space to criticize Biden, who served as Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years. Warren said that \u201cwe all owe a huge debt to President Obama\u201d and tried to frame Medicare-for-all as an improvement on Obamacare.\n\nPressed on whether middle-class families would see a tax hike to fund the program, Warren dodged the question. \u201cMiddle-class families are going to pay less,\u201d she said, focusing on overall costs.\n\nSanders, whose voice was hoarse, also said that families are looking for \u201ceffective\u201d health care.\n\nIn the early portions of the debate, multiple candidates spoke highly of Obama and his role in shepherding through an expansive health-care plan. Obama has opted not to endorse any candidate in the primary.\n\nBefore the debate Thursday morning, Biden released a video touting working with Obama in the White House.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama was a great president,\u201d Biden wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe don\u2019t say that enough.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke was in his home state, the place where he narrowly lost to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) last November. He has tried to refocus his campaign by orienting it more toward running against Trump. In the wake of a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, he has also proposed more aggressive gun-control measures and, in channeling some of the moral outrage, has gone back to using expletives on the campaign trail. Candidates were warned ahead of the debate to avoid \u201cfoul language.\u201d\n\nThe debate only briefly touched on foreign policy, with candidates largely united in criticizing Trump\u2019s approach to China, the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nWarren said she would begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan immediately if elected, with or without a deal with the Taliban.\n\nButtigieg, a veteran who served in Afghanistan, said he would require Congress to reauthorize any war at least once every three years, to combat the problem of \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nBiden said he was \u201copposed to the surge\u201d of troops in Afghanistan that took place under Obama, and that he would call troops home as well. He also said \u201cI should\u2019ve never voted\u201d for the Iraq War.\n\nThursday\u2019s debate marked the third round of 12 scheduled Democratic debates, and the first in which a large portion of the declared candidates did not qualify. Several candidates who failed to meet minimum polling and donor targets set by the Democratic National Committee were kept off the stage.\n\nSome of those candidates, including self-help author Marianne Williamson and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), are within striking distance of qualifying for the next round of debates next month.", "description": "Joe Biden attacked more-liberal policies as the debate spotlighted questions of whether the party should pursue policies of sweeping change or\u00a0a more incremental return to normalcy.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign", "Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lwpdkPTZlMP7acJwgcv9CECdfwA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OHEGLNWVYUI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
