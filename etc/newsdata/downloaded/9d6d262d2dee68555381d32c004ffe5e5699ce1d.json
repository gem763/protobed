An impeachment would deprive us of that. We need to show what we stand for,\u201d he continued.\n\nHis comments come as House Democrats mull launching impeachment proceedings against Trump after several days of news related to a call the president had with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky. Multiple media outlets have reported that Trump asked Zelensky to look into allegations about the Biden family, specifically the former vice president's son.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced Trump's reported conduct, and she hinted that it could push her over the edge to support impeachment.\n\n\"I've said to people, 'As soon as we have the facts, we're ready.' Now we have the facts. We're ready ... for later today,\" Pelosi said at the Atlantic's Ideas Summit on Tuesday. She's scheduled to speak at 5 p.m. this evening.\n\nAdditionally, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted Tuesday that the whistleblower behind the report would \u201clike to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so. We\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week.\u201d\n\nWe have been informed by the whistleblower\u2019s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so.\n\n\n\nWe\u2018re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 24, 2019\n\nComey has made similar comments in the past and also wrote in a New York Times op-ed that his \u201cone hope\u201d was that the President not be impeached before the end of his term, wanting critics of Trump to focus on getting him out of office through the democratic process in 2020.\n\nComey has also said in the past that he believes Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice if he was not a sitting president, based on the findings in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe report.\n\nAt the United Nations in New York, Trump was asked about reports that Pelosi will announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cIf she does that, they all say that\u2019s a positive for me in the election,\u201d the president said.\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, Rebecca Morin, William Cummings, Bart Jansen, John Fritze, David Jackson and Michael Collins.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump impeachment inquiry: James Comey says don't oust the president", "description": "When asked about impeaching Trump, the former FBI director answered \u201cas a citizen, I hope not because I think the American people would be let off the hook.\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YhOI0Dnnron61g658ypEUA--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/9b661d9ff13062ee78de5c47b70ed7c0", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
