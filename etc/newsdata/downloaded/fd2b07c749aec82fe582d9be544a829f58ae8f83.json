It\u2019s not just Russell Westbrook grabbing a rebound and pushing the ball out in transition (although that\u2019s part of it), it\u2019s also working early in the shot clock \u2014 just 14 percent the Rockets offense was in transition, which is right where Houston was last season (stats via Cleaning The Glass). The Rockets were just a little more efficient when then ran on Thursday.\n\nChris Paul, a guy who wants to slow the game down and survey the floor, is in Oklahoma City now, and the Rockets are running.

We\u2019re working on it.\u201d Houston had 27 fast break points in the opener, matching their most in any game last season. \u2014 Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) October 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, that\u2019s a reference to the \u201cseven seconds or less\u201d Suns of D\u2019Antoni and Steve Nash.\n\nThese Rockets will actually be faster than those Suns because the entire league is playing faster now (D\u2019Antoni and those Suns revolutionized the game, but the pace they played at would have been the slowest in the league last season because they were the only team trying to run like that).\n\nStory continues\n\nCan they win playing faster is another question. The Rockets are going to score points, as we saw against the Bucks, but can they get stops will be the big question. In crunch time opening night, with Giannis Antetokounmpo fouled out, Houston still didn\u2019t defend well enough, or score well enough, to get the win. There\u2019s work to do, no matter how many seconds it takes to get off a shot.", "description": "In their season-opening loss to the Bucks, the Houston Rockets had 109 possessions, more than 10 possessions a game faster than they averaged last season (stats via NBA.com).
