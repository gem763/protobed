He was released as officials were preparing to formally withdraw the controversial bill, per AP.\n\nWhy it matters: The bill triggered months of massive demonstrations in the Chinese territory that morphed into a wider pro-democracy protest movement that's embroiled U.S. politics. Congress has raised China's ire by pressing ahead with a bill supporting the Hong Kong protesters and the NBA has become involved in a standoff with Chinese officials over the movement.", "description": "Authorities are set to formally withdraw the extradition bill.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/brSRWtDs-NGs4jDWw6HPhwrkd1M=/0x249:4617x2846/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571809021393.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
