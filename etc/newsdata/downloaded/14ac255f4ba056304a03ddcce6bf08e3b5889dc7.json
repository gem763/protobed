Buzz60\n\n'Tis the season for notebooks and crayon deals.\n\nBackpacks, sneakers and collared shirts and even tech also will be at some of the lowest prices of the year as retailers try to woo back-to-school shoppers.\n\nAccording to the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights and Analytics\u2019 annual back-to-school spending survey, families with children in elementary school through high school are expected to spend an average of $696.70, which would top the record of $688.62 set in 2012.\n\nFamilies with college students are expected to spend an average $976.78, which is up from last year\u2019s $942.17 and would top the previous record set in 2017 of $969.88.\n\n\u201cBack-to-class shoppers still have the bulk of their shopping to do and are waiting to see what the best deals and promotions will be at a variety of different retailers,\u201d said Phil Rist, an executive vice president at Prosper Insights, in a statement.\n\nA survey from consultancy Deloitte found price often matters most when shopping for back to school, with 57% of respondents saying competitive prices were a top motivator.\n\nBack-to-school sales tax holidays: Is your state giving families a tax break this year?\n\nSavings for teachers: These stores are treating teachers to back-to-school discounts\n\nBut don't worry, you don\u2019t need to do all of your school shopping at once.\n\n\"Spreading it out over the year can help your budget and give you a chance to hit major sales,\" said Kelsey Sheehy, personal finance expert for NerdWallet. \"Take advantage of tax holidays and back-to-school sales to get the items you need now, but don\u2019t be afraid to hold off until later in August.\"\n\nIf your state has a sales tax holiday, educate yourself on what's tax free and what isn\u2019t. Three states had their tax holidays in July and 13 are offering a tax break in August.\n\nShop smart\n\nSome school supplies are at the lowest prices of the year in August and early September, but you can save more with the following tips.\n\nMake a list of everything you need. Target has school supply lists available through its School List Assist feature and Walmart also has teacher lists online.\n\nCompare prices. Start with a simple Google search of the product you want or use a price-comparison website like www.bizrate.com. When in store, one of the easiest ways to check prices is by scanning a product with the Amazon app or another competitor.\n\nUse coupons. Stores have coupons in their weekly sales circulars and on their apps and websites. At Target, use Cartwheel to save on hundreds of items each day.\n\nEarn points and rewards. Take advantage of store loyalty programs to get money off a future purchase. Also look for other savings opportunities like earning Kohl\u2019s Cash on purchases of $50 or more and paying with a rewards credit card.\n\nThere are apps for paying, too. Ibotta and Raise recently added mobile payments at dozens of stores and restaurants, which also allows you to earn a percentage of your purchase back. At Old Navy, get 7% of your purchase back when you pay through Ibotta and at Walmart, earn 1% on all purchases.\n\nShopping online\n\nWhen shopping online, look for coupon codes, free shipping and stores that offer free return shipping.\n\nAvoid shipping fees by using in-store pickup. Stores that offer this option include Best Buy, J.C. Penney, Kmart, Office Depot, OfficeMax, Macy\u2019s, Kohl\u2019s, Sears, Staples, Target and Walmart.\n\nCheck a product's price history on Amazon using camelcamelcamel, which has a Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browser extension called the Camelizer. Or go to www.camelcamelcamel.com.\n\nUse Cartwheel to save money at Target.

Others allow you to price match competitors\u2019 online prices, including Amazon.\n\nTiming matters. The price usually has to be valid at the time of match, and the item has to be in stock by the competitor.\n\nIt has to be an identical item, brand name, size and model number. For online prices, third-party sellers are excluded.\n\nBeware of other exclusions. Target, for instance, notes competitor doorbusters and lightning sales are excluded.\n\nWhen in doubt, ask to speak to a store manager.\n\nSome stores will offer online price matching by chat or by calling.\n\nReceipt reminders\n\nAlways check your receipt before leaving the store. You should also keep receipts for:\n\nEasier exchanges or returns. If the store is out of a size or a color you want, see if you can exchange the item for the right size and color once it\u2019s in stock.\n\nPrice adjustments. If an item you bought goes on sale within the week or two after, some stores will credit you the difference.\n\nFor submitting rebates. If you buy an item that\u2019s eligible for a rebate, make sure to submit the rebate or it won't be a good deal. If you\u2019re not going to follow through, consider looking for another sale.\n\nDigitize the receipts using apps like Receipt Hog and ReceiptPal, which also helps track spending and reward you for your purchases.\n\nStocking up\n\nIn the days leading up to the new school year as well as the days after the year begins, stores will have some of the best prices on essentials such as notebook paper and notebooks.\n\nStock up to avoid having to pay full price in the middle of the school year.\n\nConsider donating extra school supplies to a school supply drive.\n\nIn a few weeks, plan to shop clearance racks when school supplies and clothes will be marked down. For young children, buy the next size in clothes when the price is right.\n\nFollow Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/02/back-school-shopping-2019-money-saving-tips-stretch-your-budget/1885232001/", "description": "Preparing for the new school year is pricey, but it's possible to save time and money.
