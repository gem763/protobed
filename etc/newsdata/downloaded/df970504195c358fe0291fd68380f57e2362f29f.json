Some MPs began to return to the House of Commons within minutes.\n\nAnnouncing the verdict reached by all 11 judges who heard the case, Supreme Court president Lady Hale said: \"The court is bound to conclude that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d\n\nThe judges dismissed the government's argument that the suspension of parliament was a routine step to allow the preparation of new laws ahead of the Queen\u2019s speech on 14 October.\n\nLady Hale said: \"This was not a normal prorogation. It prevented parliament from carrying out its constitutional role for five out of the possible eight weeks between the end of the summer recess and exit day on 31 October.\"\n\nShe said the \u201cprolonged suspension of parliamentary democracy took place in quite exceptional circumstances\u201d as Britain prepares to leave the EU, and that \"the effect on the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I\n\n\"In reaching their conclusion, they have vindicated the right and duty of parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinise the executive and hold ministers to account. As the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn made an immediate statement from the podium at Labour's conference in Brighton, saying Mr Johnson should \"consider his position\".\n\nHe said: \"It demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by him. The Supreme Court passes the baton to the Speaker to recall parliament. I will in touch immediately to demand that parliament is recalled so we can question that prime minister, demand that he obeys the law that has been passed by parliament.\"\n\n\"A Labour government would want to be held to account, we wouldn't bypass democracy.\n\n\"And I invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position.\"\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry, who led the challenge to prorogation in the Scottish courts, said the ruling was \u201ca huge victory for the rule of law and for democracy\u201d and also called on Mr Johnson to resign.\n\nShe said: \u201cThere is nothing to stop us members of parliament, such as myself and my colleagues from resuming immediately the important job of scrutinising this minority Tory government as we hurtle towards Brexit.\u201d\n\nOf Mr Johnson, she said: \u201cHis position is untenable and he should have the guts for once to do the decent thing and resign.\"\n\nOutside the court, protesters on both sides of the Brexit debate had waited in the rain for the verdict, with demonstrators holding signs reading \u201cdefend democracy\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t silence parliament\u201d breaking out in cheers as the news broke.\n\nMr Johnson had faced heavy criticism for failing to lodge a witness statement detailing his reasoning for the suspension, leaving government lawyers to rely on a 15 August memorandum from a Downing Street legal adviser recommending prorogation to begin from 9 to 12 September.\n\nJudges found that the document did not explain why a five-week prorogation was needed rather than the normal four to six days, the difference between prorogation and recess or consider the impact on achieving an \u201corderly withdrawal\u201d from the EU.\n\nGovernment lawyers had argued that Mr Johnson\u2019s advice to the Queen was a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d that could not be ruled on by judges because of the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.\n\nBut Lady Hale said courts \u201chave exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over the lawfulness of acts of the government for centuries\u201d and have the power to \u201cdecide upon the existence and limits of a prerogative power\u201d.\n\nThe Supreme Court found that because the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen was unlawful, the prorogation order was effectively a \u201cblank sheet of paper\u201d that had no legal effect on parliament.\n\nLady Hale said: \u201cParliament has not been prorogued. It is for parliament, and in particular the Speaker and the Lord Speaker to decide what to do next.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson's decision to suspend parliament earlier this month was unlawful, the Supreme Court has ruled.
