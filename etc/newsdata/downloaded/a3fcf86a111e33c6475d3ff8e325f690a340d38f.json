(\u201cOrganic Garage\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V:OG) is pleased to announce the completion of a non-brokered private placement offering (the \u201cOffering\u201d) of an aggregate principal amount of CAD $3,000,000 (the \u201cPrincipal\u201d) in unsecured convertible debentures (the \u201cDebentures\u201d) for an aggregate purchase price of CAD $2,925,000 (the \u201cSubscription Price\u201d) (representing and including an original issue discount equal to 2.5% of the purchase price). The net proceeds of the Offering will be used to repay in full a secured loan held by BDC Capital Inc. as well as for general working capital.\n\nMatt Lurie, CEO of Organic Garage commented, \u201cI am delighted to complete this convertible debenture which will be used to repay in full the debt amount outstanding from the BDC. This is something we have been working very diligently on and I am pleased with what we have accomplished. This convertible debenture helps improve the flexibility and the cash flow of the company by removing the cash interest payments that were being paid to the BDC which were negatively impacting our Profit and Loss statement. I look forward to building on this accomplishment and will now focus on the next steps in our growth plan.\u201d\n\nThe Debentures will mature 36 months from October 25, 2019 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d) and bear interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum (the \u201cInterest\u201d). The portion of the Debentures equal to the Subscription Price ($2,925,000) will become convertible at the option of the holders into units (the \u201cConversion Units\u201d) on the Maturity Date at a conversion price of $0.11 per Conversion Unit (the \u201cConversion Price\u201d), each Conversion Unit consisting of one common share of the Company (the each a \u201cCommon Share\u201d, collectively the \u201cCommon Shares\u201d) and one-half of one share purchase warrant, each whole warrant (each a \u201cWarrant\u201d, collectively the \u201cWarrants\u201d) entitling the holder to acquire one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.18 per Common Share for a period of 36 months. Subject to the prior approval of the Exchange, the difference between the Principal and the Subscription Price will be converted into Common Shares at the Market Price on the date before the date of conversion.\n\nInterest will be paid within 30 days of each fiscal quarter while the Debentures remain outstanding. Subject to the approval of the TSX-V in each instance and unless otherwise agreed by the Company and the holders of Debentures, accrued and unpaid Interest will be converted into Common Shares at a conversion price equal to the Market Price (as defined in the polices of the TSX-V) at the time of conversion. Otherwise, any or all interest payments will be made in cash.\n\nThe Company may repay the then outstanding principal amount of the Debentures at any time together with an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the then outstanding principal of the Debentures (the \u201cEarly Repayment\u201d), to be paid in cash unless otherwise agreed and subject to the prior approval of the TSX-V. Further, in the event of a change of control event, the Company may repurchase the Debentures at a price equal to: a) 125% of the principal amount of the Debentures in the first 12 month period following the Closing Date; b) 150% of the principal amount of the Debentures in the second 12 month period following the Closing Date; or c) 175% of the principal amount of the Debentures in the third 12 month period from the Closing Date, together with any accrued and unpaid Interest (the \u201cChange of Control Redemption\u201d). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a change of control event occurs within 6 months of an Early Repayment, the Early Repayment will be deemed to be a Change of Control Redemption, entitling holders whose Debentures were repaid to receive a top-up payment equivalent to the difference between the Early Repayment amount and the Change of Control Redemption amount.\n\nThe Offering was conditionally approved by the TSX-V prior to closing. No fees or commissions were paid with respect to the offering. All of the Debentures issued, and any securities into which they may be exchanged or converted, are subject to resale restrictions imposed by applicable laws or regulation, a statutory hold period expiring on February 26, 2020.\n\nAbout Organic Garage Ltd.\n\nOrganic Garage (TSX-V: OG) is one of Canada\u2019s leading independent organic grocers committed to offering its customers a wide selection of healthy and natural products at everyday affordable prices.
