Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-final AP\n\nJones was sat in the crowd on Sunday alongside defence coach John Mitchell, Rugby Football Union chairman Andy Cosslett and chief executive Bill Sweeney to see their World Cup final opponents in what was an \u201carm wrestle\u201d of a semi-final.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough old game,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt was interesting: both the coaches and captains said they anticipated the game to be an arm wrestle and it was. It was a tough, exacting semi-final. That\u2019s what you expect at the World cup. We are looking forward to playing against South Africa now.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we are really worried about is how the Springboks turn up on Saturday. They won a tough semi-final and when you are in the final of a World Cup, you have done a lot of things right.\n\n\u201cThey are a massively aggressive physical forward pack, they probably played their stronger team in the second half as opposed to the first. They are going to be a difficult side to beat. We are going to enjoy the preparations this week, getting ourselves right, we know a couple of areas that we think we can expose in them and we\u2019ll make sure we are well-prepared in those areas.\u201d\n\nJones saw enough from the Springboks to expect them to play a physically-dominant style that managed to constrict Wales from playing their expansive game, with scrum-half Faf de Klerk and Pollard kicking the ball almost as many times as they passed it.\n\nBut he did pay credit to the job head coach Rassie Erasmus has done to turn around the Springboks, having picked them up off the floor 18 months ago after replacing Allister Coetzee.\n\n\u201cRassie is a cunning coach, good coach and has done a great job with the Springboks,\u201d added the England coach. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared for the unexpected. They can play in different ways. You saw Faf de Klerk do 15-20 box kicks in the game but we know Pollard is an excellent kicker. The way he goal-kicked as fantastic. He was smooth, nice touch on the ball and that is a wonderful advantage for them.\n\n\u201cSo we know they can play differently and we\u2019re aware of that but we also know that they are going to come through the front door. There are not many Springbok teams that don\u2019t come through the front door. We\u2019ve got to be ready at the front door and have enough cover at the back door too.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones took a swipe at old rival Warren Gatland by wishing him the best for Wales\u2019s third-placed play-off against New Zealand\u00a0this Friday.
