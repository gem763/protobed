He noted that he\u2019d been working on a new project at ArenaNet, but was now going to start a new studio with some friends.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for me to take a step back,\u201d he said, expressing the desire to work on something smaller scale.\n\nArenaNet\u2019s main game is Guild Wars 2, the massively multiplayer adventure that launched in 2012 and has received numerous expansions since then. A source who told Kotaku last week about pending departures at ArenaNet said that O\u2019Brien is one of eight developers leaving the studio, and that collectively they amounted to the early development team for a new Guild Wars project, potentially Guild Wars 3.\n\nAnother source close to the studio said that while a Guild Wars 3 had not been officially greenlit internally, the work of O\u2019Brien\u2019s team could have developed into such a sequel.\n\nIn an official statement, an ArenaNet rep focused on praising O\u2019Brien and the future of their long-running current game. \u201cWe are very appreciative of Mike\u2019s leadership and contributions to Guild Wars over the years and wish him well in his future endeavours,\u201d the rep said, mentioning that Guild Wars 2 will continue with the upcoming Icebrood Saga update.\n\nIn his message, O\u2019Brien noted that he\u2019d transitioned away from running the Guild Wars 2 team two years ago, handing that authority to Mike Zadorojny. \u201cNow as he takes on a larger leadership role, I am confident that ArenaNet and Guild Wars 2 are in good hands,\u201d O\u2019Brien wrote. \u201cZ is a true champion of the Guild Wars franchise and of this studio\u2019s values; he is the best person to continue carrying the torch at the company.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien didn\u2019t say what projects he had been working on for the past two years. He did note that he already has something new lined up: \u201cNext week I\u2019ll join some of my friends in forming a new studio. We\u2019ll go back to the beginning and make small games again.\u201d\n\nKotaku\u2019s understanding, via our source, is that while O\u2019Brien will be working with other departing ArenaNet developers who had recently been working on technology for the potential future Guild Wars project, the developers are not taking what they made with them.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what this means in terms of any full sequels to Guild Wars 2 from ArenaNet, but it is another blow to a company that had managed to keep its MMOs alive long after so many other companies trying to do so had flamed out. In February, ArenaNet laid off more than 140 developers. The company rep said ArenaNet still employs about 200 and maintains Guild Wars 2 and its predecessor, the original Guild Wars.", "description": "In a heartfelt message on ArenaNet\u2019s webpage this afternoon, its president Mike O\u2019Brien announced that after 19 years, he was leaving the company he co-founded.
