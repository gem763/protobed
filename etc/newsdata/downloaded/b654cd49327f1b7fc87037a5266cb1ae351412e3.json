It took six months to find out what had happened to the group.\n\n\u201cThey were sold and their families were asked for ransom\u201d, the former staff member said.\n\nIn February 2019, the Libyan government revealed that there were 23 detention centres operating in Libya, holding over 5,000 asylum seekers. While they are officially run by the government, in reality it is Libya\u2019s complex patchwork of militias that are in control.\n\nEven those ostensibly run by Libya\u2019s Directorate for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM) are effectively under the control of whichever armed group controls the neighbourhood where a centre is located.\n\nRule of militias\n\nMilitias, also known as \u201ckatibas\u201d, are de-facto in control of the gates of the centres and the management. In many cases, migrants and refugees are under arrest in locations which are not considered official detention facilities, but \u201cholding places\u201d for investigation.\n\nBy correct protocol, they should be sent to proper detention facilities, but in reality procedures are seldom respected and asylum seekers are detained with no legal review or rights.\n\nFor many migrants and refugees, the ordeal begins at sea.\n\nAccording to the Libyan coast guard, from January to August 2019, nearly 6,000 people were intercepted and brought back to Libya.\n\nOn September 19, a man from Sudan died after being shot in the stomach hours after being returned to shore.\n\nThe IOM, whose staff witnessed the attack, said it occurred at Abusitta disembarkation point in Tripoli, when 103 people that had been returned to shore were resisting being sent back to detention centres.\n\nIOM staff who were on the scene, reported that armed men began shooting in the air when several migrants tried to run away from their guards.\n\n\u201cThe death is a stark reminder of the grim conditions faced by migrants picked up by the Coast Guard after paying smugglers to take them to Europe, only to find themselves put into detention centres\u201d said IOM Spokesperson Leonard Doyle.\n\nWith conflict escalating in Tripoli and many detention centres located on the frontline, the majority of the people intercepted by Libyan coast guards are brought to al-Khoms, a coastal city 120km east of the Libyan capital.\n\nKhoms - Photo: Sara Creta\n\nTortured, sold, and released\n\nAccording to UN sources, guards at the city\u2019s two detention facilities - al-Khoms and Souq al-Khamis - have either facilitated access to the militias or were afraid to deny them access.\n\n\u201cLet me be honest with you, I don\u2019t trust anyone in al-Khoms centre,\u201d a former DCIM official told Euronews.\n\n\u201cThe detention centre has been officially closed by the DCIM but the militia there do whatever they want and they don\u2019t respect the orders given by the Ministry of Interior.\n\n\u201cPeople have been tortured, sold and released after paying money. The management and the militia in al-Khoms, they act independently from the government\u201d.\n\nLast June, during the protection sector coordination meeting in Tripoli, UN agencies and international organisations raised the question of people disappearing on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cIn one week at least 100 detainees disappeared and despite the closure of the centre, the Libyan coast guard continued to bring refugees to al-Khoms detention centre\u201d according to a note of the meeting seen by Euronews.\n\nThe head of an international organisation present at the meeting, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \u201cMany organisations have been turning their back on the situation, as they were not visiting the centre anymore.\n\n\u201c19 people from Eritrea were at risk, including young ladies between 14 and 19 years old\u201d.\n\nDuring a press briefing last June, the spokesman for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Rupert Colville, reported that women held in detention have been sold into sexual exploitation.\n\nDavid, a migrant who had been detained in Misrata detention centre was able to get out after transiting from a safe house in al-Khoms. He said that centre staff \u201chad been extorting money from detainees for months.\n\n\u201cI didn't have a choice as the UN refused to register me because I come from Central African Republic and my nationality is not among the one recognised by UNHCR.\u201d\n\nJohn has been deteined in Tarik Al Sika Detention Center for more than 2 years. He only received a piece of papaer from UNHCR with his registration number.

But the centre has instead been transformed into an arrest and investigation centre.\n\nLocated at the Az-Z\u0101wiyah Refinery, which is secured by Al-Nasser brigade since 2011, it is close to the base of the Az-Z\u0101wiyah coastguard\n\nBoth the commander of the Libyan Coast Guard\u2019s Unit and the head of Al-Nasr brigade are sanctioned by UN and the United States for alleged involvement in human trafficking and migrant smuggling.\n\nMohammed Kushlaf is working in cooperation with \u201cOsama\u201d (\u27a1\ufe0f SEE PART 2), who is in charge of the detention facility. His name appears 67 times in the recent investigation conducted by Italian prosecutor Luigi Patronaggio.\n\nPhoto: Sara Creta Tewolde, 23 years old \"In April 18 I tried to cross again from Zuwara. The LCG caught us and brought us back to Zuwara DC, where we stayed 10 days, then Gharyan. Then I was transferred to Tareq Sikka, Tareq el-Matar, Zintan and Gharyan\"\n\n\u2018Inhumane conditions\u2019\n\nThe investigation had \u201cconfirmed the inhumane conditions\u201d endured by many migrants and \u201cthe need to act, at an international level, to protect their most basic human rights.\u201d\n\nThe Government of National Accord has supported the UN sanctions and issued public statements of condemnation against the trafficking and smuggling of migrants.\n\nThe Libyan prosecutor has also issued an order to suspend the commander of the Libyan Coast Guard and bring him into custody for investigations, although this was never implemented, confirmed a Libyan lawyer working at the Ministry of Justice.\n\nSources at the DCIM mentioned that between September 2018 and April 2019 - when the Libyan National Army (LNA) troops guided by the general Khalifa Haftar seized Tripoli's southern suburbs \u2013 many detention centres were located near the clashes.\n\nSalaheddin, Ain Zara, Qasr Bin Ghashir and Tariq Al Matar detention centres have been closed because of the conflict.\n\nAs a result, large groups of refugees and migrants have been displaced or transferred to other locations. A DCIM officer in Tripoli mentioned that \u201cThe Tariq Al Matar centre was in the middle of the clashes and many refugees left to find safety in other areas after a few people were injured. A group was transferred to Ain Zara and another to Janzour detention centre, some 20 kilometres southwest of Tripoli's centre.\u201d\n\nDetention center in Khoms.

I was one of them. They took five of us from the centre,\u201d said Amir, a Sudanese asylum seeker who is detained in Abu Salim.\n\nA former DCIM officer confirmed that in June 2018, the head of Abu Salim DCIM, Mohamed al-Mashay (aka Abu Azza), was killed by an armed group following internal disputes over power.\n\nThe Qasr Bin Ghashir detention centre, in which 700 people were locked up, was attacked on April 23. Video and photographic evidence shows refugees and migrants trapped in detention having incurred gunshot wounds.\n\nMultiple reports suggested several deaths and at least 12 people injured. A former DCIM officer mentioned that behind the attack there was a dispute over the control of the territory: it is a very strategic point being the main road to enter to Tripoli.", "description": "In February 2019, the Libyan government revealed that there were 23 detention centres operating in Libya, holding over 5,000 asylum seekers.
