I definitely played well out there. It was really tough because you're definitely watching what Jessica is shooting and scoring, and always just try to keep in my own game,\" said Kang.\n\nKang birdied the 15th to pull two strokes ahead, but Korda responded with a birdie of her own on 17. Kang then holed a 3-foot par putt on the 18th to win her third career title.\n\n\"There were a lot of birdie opportunities. I made some really great up and downs. I've never been more nervous than the last putt for some reason, but I made it,\" Kang said.\n\nKorda had three birdies and three bogeys for even par on the day.\n\n\"You know, just couldn't get anything going today. It was just one of those days where it just wasn't meant to be, I guess,\" said Korda.\n\nLiu Yu of China shot a 7-under 65 to surge into a three-way tie for third with Japan's Nasa Hataoka and LPGA rookie Kristen Gillman at 13 under and the best finish of Gillman's career.\n\n\"I definitely knew I would be able to do it, but also being a rookie and being in Asia - or at least in China for my first time \u2014 you don't really expect to have this good of a finish and your best finish so far this year out of the country,\" said Gillman.\n\nAmerican Megan Khang tied the 18-hole scoring record with an 8-under 64, including a hole-in-one on the par-3 11th to finish tied for seventh.\n\nBrooke Henderson of Canada shot a 1-over 73 to drop from third place into a tie for ninth with top-ranked Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda at 9 under.\n\nThe Buick LPGA Shanghai was the first of four straight events in Asia. The tour moves to Busan, South Korea next week for the BMW Ladies Championship.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
