There was one in white that came with a cut-out midriff, asymmetric ruffled hem and balloon sleeves, and another in black that suspended superfluous satin from the bust.\n\nThe clothes on the catwalk today were very much indicative of designers who, while at ease with sticking to what they do best, aren\u2019t afraid to push the sartorial envelope. Alas, being a Preen girl never seemed more appealing.\n\nRoland Mouret\n\nRoland Mouret quickly forged a signature for himself when he launched his brand in 1998, translating his reverence for the female form into garments that oozed sex appeal and sensuality.\n\nCase in point: in 2005, Mouret unveiled the Galaxy dress that would ultimately make his name. Using the curving female figure as the starting point, the souped-up and cinched in gown became near ubiquitous among A-listers with everyone from Cameron Diaz to Scarlett Johansson and Dita Von Teese all wearing it well within a six-month period.\n\nHowever, this season there was far less sex appeal and a renewed focus on simplicity.\n\n\u201cA designer should define silhouettes not just clothes: this season\u2019s silhouette is the evolution and continuation of my work over the years,\u201d Mouret said.", "description": "The third day of London Fashion Week shows has come to an end and the five-day event is nearing its sartorial climax.But, while show-goers might be exhibiting signs of slowing down \u2013 writer\u2019s cramp, exhaustion and, of course, hangovers are rife \u2013 designers continued to flood the runways with garb that", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8aIQZukqAI0npbvhykeNsQ--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/f7f5f8bed9ba8463406cb26776b3f819", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
