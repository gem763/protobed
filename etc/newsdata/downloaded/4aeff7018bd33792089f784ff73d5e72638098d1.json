Schiff (D-Calif.) to explain publicly on Thursday his reasons for refusing.\n\nLast week, Schiff subpoenaed Maguire for the complaint, accusing him of violating whistleblower law by failing to have done so earlier. Maguire\u2019s stated reasons have to do with the material involving \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201cpotentially privileged communications,\u201d Schiff said in a letter Friday.\n\nSchiff has said he is unable to discuss the complaint\u2019s content.\n\nThe unprecedented standoff raises concerns that the White House, Justice Department or other executive branch officials are trying to block Maguire from transmitting the complaint to cover up serious misconduct, Schiff said.\n\n\u201cA director of national intelligence has never prevented a properly submitted whistleblower complaint that the [intelligence community inspector general] determined to be credible and urgent from being provided to the congressional intelligence committees,\u201d Schiff said in a statement Friday. \u201cNever.\u201d\n\nIn his letter to Maguire, Schiff said: \u201cThe committee \u2014 and the American people \u2014 must know why, in violation of law, a whistleblower complaint is being concealed, whether the underlying conduct involves the president or those around him, and whether the White House is involved in trying to cover up this authorized disclosure.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement Monday: \u201cWe are currently reviewing the request and will respond appropriately. ODNI and Acting DNI Maguire are committed to fully complying with the law and upholding whistleblower protections and have done so here.\u201d\n\nSteven A. Groves, a White House spokesman, declined to comment.\n\n[Trump announces shake-up at top of U.S. intelligence]\n\nMaguire was named acting director in August following the announced departure of Daniel Coats and when it became clear that President Trump would not put Coats\u2019s deputy, Sue Gordon, in the position. Maguire was not angling for the job \u2014 he had hoped Gordon would be tapped, and it is unclear if Trump will seek to nominate him as director.\n\nA member of the intelligence community submitted the complaint to the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, on Aug. 12. The individual once worked on the staff of the White House National Security Council, which frequently borrows intelligence community personnel. Atkinson reviewed the complaint and determined it was credible and met the law\u2019s definition of an \u201curgent concern,\u201d according to Schiff\u2019s letter. On Aug. 26, Atkinson submitted it to Maguire, who is his boss.\n\nAt that point, Maguire had seven days to transmit the complaint and the inspector general\u2019s determination to Congress, according to the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\n\u201cYet in violation of the statute\u2019s explicit command,\u201d Maguire refused to share the complaint and supporting material, Schiff said in his letter. He said this \u201cmarks the first time\u201d a director of national intelligence has sought to conceal from Congress a whistleblower complaint.\n\nIn a further departure from the law, Schiff said, Maguire consulted the Justice Department about the complaint, \u201ceven though the statute does not provide\u201d him discretion to review or reverse the inspector general\u2019s determination or to involve another executive branch entity.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nSchiff, speaking Sunday on the CBS News program \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said Maguire told him \u201cessentially that he is answering to a higher authority\u201d in refusing to turn over the complaint. Schiff added that \u201cthere are only a few people above the DNI.\u201d Maguire, by law, reports only to the president.\n\nOn Friday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence sent a letter to Schiff asserting that, because the complaint involves \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201cpotentially privileged communications\u201d by one or more people outside the intelligence community, the director lacks authority to send the complaint to the intelligence committees, a committee aide said. That prompted the subpoena.\n\nSaid Schiff: \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty narrow group of people that it could apply to that are both above the DNI in authority and also involve privileged communications. So I think it\u2019s fair to assume this involves either the president or people around him or both.\u201d\n\nCarol D.
