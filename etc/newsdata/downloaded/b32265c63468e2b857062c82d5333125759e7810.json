Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro weighed in on the first question about abortion rights in the Democratic presidential debates.\n\nGabbard, Klobuchar and Warren agreed that Roe v. Wade, the historic 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortions in the U.S., should be codified. Both Buttigieg and Castro supported enforcing term limits for Supreme Court justices and de-politicizing the court as much as possible.\n\nBooker said that if he were voted in as president he would create an office of reproductive freedom that would oversee reproductive protections. The senator from New Jersey also pointed out that the attack on reproductive rights is about privilege as much as it is about sexism.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThey\u2019re not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country \u2014 liberty, the ability to control your own body \u2014 but they are particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country, it is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body,\u201d he added.\n\nMost of the candidates did not use the word \u201cabortion\u201d and instead chose to use more encompassing and less controversial terms, like reproductive rights and reproductive health care. Gabbard and Warren were the only two candidates to use the word \u201cabortion.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren: \"On Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here. I lived in an America where abortion was illegal. And rich women still got abortions. What we are talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/Tm0PSpVtFL \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nWarren later piggybacked on Booker\u2019s point, adding that when abortion was illegal, rich women were still able to get abortions.\n\n\u201cI lived in an America where abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions because they could travel and go places where it was legal,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about now is people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are the 14-year-olds molested by a family member.\u201d\n\nShe added that a woman\u2019s right to choose should not be left to the Supreme Court but should be done \u201cthrough democracy, because we can.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar took a moment to address Donald Trump directly, telling the audience what she would say to the president if he were on the stage on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cYou know what I would say to him? I\u2019d say, \u2018You said you wanted to do this, in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail and then you tried to dial it back and said you wanted to put doctors in jails. That\u2019s exactly what the Alabama law is,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYou, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women.\u201d\n\nIn the last six months, states including Georgia, Ohio and Missouri have all banned abortion as early as the first trimester. Alabama passed the strictest abortion restriction in the country in May, banning the procedure in all cases, including rape and incest. The only exception is if the life of the pregnant woman is at risk. Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers were considering the death penalty for any woman who gets an abortion.\n\nHarris was the first to bring up reproductive rights earlier in the night when moderators asked about health care access.\n\n\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word \u2015 with all of these discussions about health care \u2015 on women\u2019s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say women will die \u2014 poor women, women of color will die,\u201d Harris added. \u201cBecause these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.\u201d", "description": "More than half of the 12 presidential contenders shared their plan on how to protect reproductive rights in the face of state anti-abortion legislation.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da68378210000510fad28d2.jpeg?cache=tvgdr5jprx&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
