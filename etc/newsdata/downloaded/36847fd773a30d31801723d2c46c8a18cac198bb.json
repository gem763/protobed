People up to 53 miles away could experience temporary blindness.\n\nBut a longer-term threat would come in the minutes and hours after that explosion.\n\nNuclear explosions can produce clouds of dust and sand-like radioactive particles that disperse into the atmosphere \u2014 what's referred to as nuclear fallout. Exposure to this fallout can result in radiation poisoning, which can damage the body's cells and can prove fatal.\n\nThe debris takes about 15 minutes to reach ground level after an explosion, so a person's response during that period could be a matter of life and death.\n\nHere are the dos and don'ts to remember in the event of a nuclear attack.", "description": "After seeking shelter, a few life-saving measures could reduce your exposure to nuclear fallout after an explosion.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a5ac72e22af0c3e4c5364?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
