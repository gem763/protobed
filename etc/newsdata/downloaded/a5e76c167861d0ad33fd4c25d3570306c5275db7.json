Police Officer Jonathon Westbrook says police also searched a second home before determining Villanueva-Morales wasn't there.\n\nVillanueva-Morales and 23-year-old Javier Alatorre are charged with four counts of first-degree murder. Alatorre was arrested Sunday in Kansas City, Missouri. Police say Villanueva-Morales should be considered \"armed and dangerous.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
