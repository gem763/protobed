The EFL will consult with its Clubs over the coming weeks.\n\n\"Prior to formal consideration by any league competition of an eventual application from Bury FC to return to league football, clear evidence would be required of the Club\u2019s financial viability and its ability to fulfil its ongoing commitments.\"", "description": "The English Football League\u00a0have agreed to meet\u00a0Bury\u00a0with a view to reinstating the club in the Football League.\u00a0 The Shakers were expelled from League One on August 27 after a late takeover bid from C&N Sporting Risk failed.
