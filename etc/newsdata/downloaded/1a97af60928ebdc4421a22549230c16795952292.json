There are pieces, like the free tuition part, that I\u2019d like to see her rework substantially. It\u2019s already clear she\u2019s going to come up with a revised agenda and I say let\u2019s wait for that to have a real point-by-point argument.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a more logical world, the assessment from like-minded fans that \u201cshe\u2019s going to have to come up with a revised agenda\u201d would be a major counterargument against a candidate running on the unofficial slogan, \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d And \u201cwait until her revised, real plans get unveiled\u201d is simultaneously an admission that the current plans are glaringly unrealistic and a plea to the electorate to put their faith in something unknown and hoping for the best.", "description": "New York Times columnist Gail Collins offers an assessment of Elizabeth Warren that is supposed to be reassuring but turns out to be the opposite.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
