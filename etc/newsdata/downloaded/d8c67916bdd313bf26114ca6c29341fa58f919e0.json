Pictured is Lindsay Lohan on The Masked Singer Australia\n\n'In week one we were all shocked at Gretel Killeen but since then it\u2019s all been a bit ho hum,' he continued.\n\nWhile McKnight says he is a big fan of the show, he believes that Channel 10 needs to invest more money in the casting department next season.\n\n'Serious questions need to be asked on how to make sure the show continues to perform next year. Seeing the show has a following it will be important for 10 to invest the money on bigger international celebrities.''\n\n'In week one we were all shocked at Gretel Killeen but since then it\u2019s all been a bit ho hum': McKnight believes that Channel 10 needs to invest more money in the casting department next season. Pictured: Gretel Killeen and Osher Gunsberg on The Masked Singer\n\nMcKnight also said that this season's celebrity reveal episodes have been 'lacking' because 'everyone has guessed who each celebrity is.'\n\n'Keeping the mystery is going to be key for series two,' he said of the quirky South Korean format.\n\nMonday night's episode saw the dramatic unmasking of the Lion as soul-singing legend Kate Ceberano.\n\nLosing it's sparkle? McKnight also said that this season's celebrity reveal episodes have been 'lacking' because 'everyone has guessed who each celebrity is'\n\nSurprise! Monday night's episode saw the dramatic unmasking of the Lion as soul-singing legend Kate Ceberano\n\nWhile the episode garnered impressive viewership, McKnight criticised Channel 10's decision to calculate the ratings in two parts - the first being Kate's performance and the second being Kate's unmasking.\n\n'Channel 10 will be celebrating that [Monday night's] Masked Singer reveal was the number one show of the night, but that victory is spoiled by the fact the main show was beaten by The Block,' he said.\n\n'Interestingly, if (Channel 10) had not split the coding (i.e. splitting the ratings show title in two) then it would have beaten The Block.'\n\nIn conclusion, McKnight said: 'Make no mistake, The Masked Singer is the best show of the year, the key will be making it even bigger and better for next year.'", "description": "The Masked Singer Australia has become a ratings hit for Channel 10.", "authors": ["Alex Michael", "Monique Friedlander For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/02/19719474-0-image-a-75_1571104589795.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
