Experts have said that using dogs could be a good way to identify archaeological sites, as it is less destructive than many traditional methods.\n\n\u201cDogs\u2019 noses obviously don\u2019t make mistakes,\u201d said Vedrana Glava\u0161, an associate professor of archaeology at the University of Zadar in Croatia and the lead author of the study, which was published in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory.\n\nGlava\u0161 had already found a few tombs in a necropolis near the prehistoric hilltop fort of Drvi\u0161ica, which dates back to the eight century BC. Hoping to find more, she contacted Andrea Pintar, a trainer who works with dogs used for sniffing out graves in criminal investigations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bronze buttons discovered during an excavation.

Glava\u0161 first sent the dogs to graves they had dug up the previous year but which were not apparent, without telling the trainers the location.\n\n\u201cWe always use at least two dogs to confirm the position,\u201d Glava\u0161 said, adding that the second trainer and dog were not told where the first dog and trainer had indicated a grave.\n\nThe canines discovered all three graves, even though the human remains, associated artefacts and surrounding soil had been removed. The area had also been exposed to wind, sun and rain since the excavation.\n\nGlava\u0161 said the porous rock around the excavated soil had probably absorbed enough of the aroma of decomposition that the dogs could still detect it.\n\nGlava\u0161 then let the dogs loose in an area they suspected more remains could be found, and excavated six new tombs \u2013 five of which are described in the recent paper.\n\nThe dogs were extremely accurate in every case. The tombs consist of small stone burial chests in the middle of walled stone circles, each about five metres in diameter. Each chest contained small bones such as the fingers and feet of several individuals \u2013 perhaps several generations from the same family \u2013 along with buckles and other artefacts.\n\nGlava\u0161 said the people in the site were probably fairly poor due to the harsh, windy climate of the area and the difficulty of growing crops.\n\nWhile Glava\u0161 has used dogs successfully in other sites in Croatia and Germany, she has yet to excavate some of the tombs located by them in Drvi\u0161ica due to a lack of time and money.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One expert said it was likely the dogs could still detect the aroma of decomposition.
