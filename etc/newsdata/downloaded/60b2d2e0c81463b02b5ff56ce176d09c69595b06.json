We\u2019re all wishing the best for Errol.\u201d\n\nSpence, a 29-year-old southpaw, unified the World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation titles two weeks ago with a split-decision victory over fellow American Shawn Porter at Los Angeles, improving to 26-0 with 21 knockouts.\n\n\u201cMy dad always tells me \u2018this boxing thing is a part of your life but it\u2019s not going to last forever. U still have a lot of life to live after that,\u2019\u201d Porter said. \u201cWith that, I\u2019m praying for @ErrolSpenceJr & his family because he has a lot of life to live and I pray he recovers quickly & fully.\u201d\n\nSpence, a welterweight quarter-finalist at the 2012 London Olympics, made his professional debut in 2012 and won his first world title, the IBF crown, by knocking out Britain\u2019s Kell Brook in England in 2017.\n\nSpence defended the title four times, beating American Lamont Peterson and Mexico\u2019s Carlos Ocampo last year and American Mikey Garcia last March before his unification showdown triumph over Porter.\n\nThere had been early talk about a 2020 fight between Porter and reigning World Boxing Association welterweight champion Manny Pacquiao, the 40-year-old Filipino icon who stands 62-7 with two drawn and 39 knockouts.\n\n\u201cPraying for @ErrolSpenceJr,\u201d Pacquiao tweeted.\n\nAnother possible future foe is World Boxing Organization champion Terrence Crawford, who tweeted: \u201cPraying for you champ @ErrolSpenceJr get well we fighters I know you will.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Undefeated welterweight boxing world champion Errol Spence has been hospitalized in a serious but not", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/e4f0a0_errol-spence-displaying-his-two-world-welterweight-boxing-title-belts-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
