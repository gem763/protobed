Add Interest\n\n\"I would say if we pulled this stunt -- you'd be eating us alive,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters on Thursday of the ongoing impeachment inquiry being led by House Democrats.\n\nBut as with most of what happens in Washington, the most dramatic statements on the two dozen Republican lawmakers storming a deposition by a Pentagon official are missing important context.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nHere are three things to know:\n\nRepublicans relied on closed-door testimony on Benghazi\n\nDemocrats insist that an investigation, which includes interviewing witnesses, doesn\u2019t have to be public even if the trial would be. (In this case, the trial would be in the Senate, following a House impeachment vote.)\n\nClosed-door depositions are also practical. With testimony kept secret, other witnesses aren\u2019t tempted to adjust their answers. And, without cameras rolling, lawmakers are more likely to dispense with the theatrics and work more quickly.\n\nThat\u2019s why in 2015, Republicans relied heavily on secret depositions in its investigation into then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of security in Benghazi, Libya, where armed militants stormed the U.S. mission there and killed the ambassador and others.\n\nTrey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who led the Benghazi investigation, said in fall 2015 that his committee held some 50 interviews \u201cthe vast majority of them private,\u201d in part because lawmakers are less likely to bicker without cameras present.\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n\u201cThe private ones always produce better results,\u201d Gowdy told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in October 2015 of congressional investigations.\n\nEarlier this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that could have come from a Republican four years ago: \u201cThis is about patriotism, not politics or partisanship,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nMichele Eve Sandberg/REX via Shutterstock\n\nRepublicans insist impeachment is different.\n\n\u201cIf this is an impeachment inquiry, then ALL Members of Congress, no matter what your party or committee assignment, need to be included,\u201d tweeted Missouri Rep. Vicky Hartzler, who was among the Republicans who stormed the meeting.\n\nThere is a downside to secrecy\n\nThe downside to a closed-door approach is that Democrats, as well as Republicans, risk losing public support as information is cherry picked and selectively leaked to the press.\n\nAt the moment, Americans are only hearing details involving Ukraine if committee staff on either side quietly shares it with the media. That makes it much more likely that the answers provided to the public is only part of the story -- and over time, the public could lose interest or come to suspect the investigation is politically driven and therefore, less credible.\n\nThe latter would benefit President Donald Trump, who has said the allegations of a quid pro quo with Ukraine are without merit.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThank you to House Republicans for being tough, smart, and understanding in detail the greatest Witch Hunt in American History,\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday.\n\nRepublicans are in the room and get to ask questions too\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, had tried earlier this month to crash a witness deposition when the House parliamentarian asked him to leave.\n\nGaetz, who described Democrats as an \u201cangry pack of rabid hyenas\u201d in a Fox News interview on Wednesday, orchestrated this week\u2019s protest because he said Democrats weren\u2019t relying on any rules.\n\nJim Lo Scalzo/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nThat\u2019s not correct. Pelosi is relying on House-approved rules that outline how committees can interview witnesses and release information.\n\nThe rules say the committee chair and ranking minority member get to decide what information is made public.\n\nAnd while Gaetz was not allowed in the meetings because he is not a member of any of the three committees conducting the impeachment inquiry, there are 45 Republicans who sit on those committees and are invited and given equal time to ask questions. That\u2019s about 1 in 4 Republicans in the House.\n\nThe meetings are held in rooms specifically designed to handle sensitive or classified information.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a staunch ally of Trump, is among those in the room. He has criticized the impeachment inquiry as illegitimate but says both sides are given an opportunity to ask questions.\n\n\u201cThere is a clock, with a timekeeper,\u201d Meadows told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.", "description": "Fact check on Republicans storming in on the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-ap-jt-191021_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
