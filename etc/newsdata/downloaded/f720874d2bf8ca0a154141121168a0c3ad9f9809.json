This includes large one-off purchases like technology and jewelry, as well as recurring expenses like rent.\n\nWhile it's possible to pay your monthly rent with a credit card, either directly through your rental company or via a third-party service like Plastiq, there are some caveats to keep in mind. The upsides include extra time to pay off your balance and the ability to earn points, miles, or cash back on your rent, but the potential downsides include carrying a balance and incurring interest if you're not able to pay off your credit card in full.\n\nHere are some reasons why you might want to pay your rent with your credit card, and some of the ways you can do so even if your landlord doesn't directly accept credit card payments.\n\nCan you pay your rent with a credit card?\n\nYou can pay rent with a credit card, but you may need to pay a service fee. If your landlord or property management accepts credit card payments, you may be lucky and not have to pay a fee \u2014 but this is rare. Even if the management company accepts credit cards, there could be a service fee of 2-3%.\n\nIf your landlord doesn't accept credit card payments for rent, you can use a third-party service like Plastiq or RentShare. You'll be charged you a processing fee for using these services, which can be as high as 2.99%. So if your rent payment is $1,500, for example, you'd need to pay $44.85 extra for the privilege of using a credit card.\n\nIs it worth the service fee?\n\nIf you have to pay a surcharge for using a credit card for your rent, you'll want to consider if this fee can be offset by the rewards you'll earn.\n\nUsing that same $1,500 rent as an example, let's say you pay rent with the Chase Freedom Unlimited, a cash-back card that earns 1.5% back on all spending. On the total of $1,544.85 (rent plus a 2.99% service fee), you'd earn about $23 back.\n\nThat's obviously less than the $44.85 you paid to use your credit card, but you could get slightly more value if you also have a Chase card that earns Ultimate Rewards points, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. In that case, you could convert your cash-back rewards from the Freedom Unlimited into Chase Ultimate Rewards points that are worth more than 1 cent apiece.\n\nBased on valuations from Business Insider e-commerce partner The Points Guy, Chase points are worth 2 cents each, so you'd get about $30 worth of points from spending $1,544.85. That's still less than the $44.85 service fee, but depending on how you use those points to book free travel, you could get more than $30 in value.\n\nOf course, sometimes the convenience of having extra time to pay off your rent is worth it, regardless of how much you'll have to pay for the privilege of using a credit card. Just don't assume it's worth paying extra to use a card because you'll earn rewards \u2014 do the math to see if you'll truly come out ahead.\n\nReasons to pay rent with a credit card\n\nYou can earn rewards such as points or cash back\n\nMany rewards credit cards offer sign-up bonuses when you open a new account and reach a minimum spending amount within a specified amount of time. These minimums can see high, like $4,000 within three months with the Chase Sapphire Preferred. However, you could be able to meet the minimum spend requirement easily if you use your credit card for relatively large expenses like rent.\n\nIn many cases, these sign-up bonuses are very valuable, as they can earn you enough points to score free flights or hotel rooms. There are also cash-back cards that give you a pretty decent return on your spending, such as the Chase Freedom Unlimited with 1.5% back and the Citi\u00ae Double Cash Card, which offers 2% back (1% back when you buy, and and 1% when you pay your bill).\n\nRead more: The best credit card sign-up bonuses available now\n\nIt gives you flexibility\n\nEven if you're not after a sign-up bonus or rewards, paying your rent with a credit card can be a good idea if you need a bit of breathing room.\n\nLet's say your rent is coming soon, but you don't get paid until a few days after it's due, and your savings account went toward a medical bill \u2014 you're down to the last penny. In this case, using your credit card gives you the ability to cover rent without having to pay a late fee. You can charge it on your card, then pay it off once payday is here.\n\nThe key here is to pay it all off once you get paid. Otherwise, you'll have to pay interest on your rent, and APRs on credit cards are at historical highs.\n\nA credit card can be better than a personal loan\n\nTaking out a personal loan to cover expenses is generally not a good idea, because these loans tend to come with high interest rates. Besides whatever amount you take out, you'll have to pay interest \u2014 and some loans might tack on an extra fee if you pay if off early, called a prepayment penalty.\n\nRead more: I used a 0% APR credit card to borrow the money to start my business, and I'd tell anyone to do the same\n\nUsing your credit card to pay rent is kind of like getting an interest-free loan \u2014 that is, if you pay the balance off in full each month. Even if you're charged a fee for third-party services to pay your rent, it'll still come out cheaper than a personal loan.\n\nCredit cards can be useful \u2014 if you're careful\n\nPaying rent with your credit card can be a very flexible and convenient option \u2014 you don't have to worry about getting paid on time or the hassle of sending in a check, and if you're trying to meet a minimum spend requirement to earn a credit card welcome bonus, paying your rent with that card is a great to get there faster.\n\nAs long as you're paying off your bill each month, you don't have to worry about paying high interest rates. But if there's a chance you'll need to carry a balance on your credit card, consider carefully whether it's worth it to do so. Only you know what's best for your financial situation \u2014 so consider the pros and cons and the financial repercussions before making a choice.", "description": "Most landlords charge a fee to pay rent with a card, but if you're working toward a sign-up bonus or need extra time to pay it could  be worth it.", "authors": ["Sarah Li Cain"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a56854025954c06148b49de?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
