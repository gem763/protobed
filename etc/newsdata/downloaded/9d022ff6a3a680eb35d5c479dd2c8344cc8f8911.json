Perhaps with proper negotiations maybe it will be open more often to the public.\"\n\nUltra-Orthodox Jews describe the tomb as a holy burial site of ancient ancestors.\n\nFrance had attempted to open the site to visitors in June after having kept it closed since 2010, initially due to renovations but later because attempts to contest its ownership complicated its reopening.\n\nIt however immediately re-closed the site after a group of more than a dozen ultra-Orthodox tried to enter and pray despite not having signed up as requested, shoving toward the gate.\n\nThe site is a remarkable example of a Roman-era tomb, considered among the largest in the region.\n\nIts unique status, Jewish veneration of the burial site and its location in the disputed east of the city added to complications in reopening it.\n\nArchaeological sites in east Jerusalem are often freighted with religious significance and questions linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThere had been a challenge at Israel's rabbinical court -- which rules on matters related to Jewish law and holy sites -- over access to the tomb and France's ownership.\n\nBefore reopening the site, France sought guarantees from Israel that it would not face legal challenges as well as commitments on how visits would be managed.\n\nIt is facing a separate court challenge to its ownership in Paris by a religious association linked to Israel's chief rabbinate, said the association's lawyer, Gilles-William Goldnadel.\n\nThe French court is expected to examine the complaint sometime next year, Goldnadel told AFP.\n\nVisitors are not allowed to descend into the tomb itself and can only visit the exterior, which includes ritual baths and an ancient frieze above its entry.", "description": "An ancient tomb in Jerusalem prized for its archaeological and religious importance was reopened for visits Thursday by France, which owns it, after a dispute over access scuttled an earlier attempt.
