Labour IS a Remain party,\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a tweet. \"I will continue campaigning with @LondonLabour to give the public the final say and stop Brexit.\"\n\nLabour has said in the past it would support a referendum that would give the British public a chance to vote on the Brexit deal that was negotiated by former Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nHowever, that deal now appears dead in the water. The Parliament rejected it several times, eventually leaving May with no other option than to resign.\n\nShe was replaced with Boris Johnson, who said he wants to re-negotiate the deal, threatening that if the EU doesn't agree to changes, the UK will leave without a deal.\n\nHowever, making the situation even more complicated, Parliament has passed a bill that forces Johnson to ask for an extension if no deal is agreed before the end of October.", "description": "Britain's Labour Party is staying put on Brexit.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasov\u00e1", "Hadas Gold", "Bianca Nobilo", "Lindsay Isaac"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190923193347-jeremy-corbyn-labour-conference-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
