China's top trade envoy, Liu He, will lead a delegation to resume trade talks with U.S. officials in Washington on Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 was down 0.4% in morning trade, after Japan's Nikkei climbed 1% and Korea's Kospi gained 1.2%. Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong rose 0.3% as Chinese markets returned from a holiday.\n\nSamsung Electronics' shares rose 2.4% after the company delivered a strong third-quarter earnings forecast.\n\nShares in London Stock Exchange Group fell 5.9% after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing pulled a $36.6 billion bid for its London rival, a deal that would have united two major trading hubs.\n\nMeanwhile, German industrial output grew slightly in August, according to official data. The rise came as a surprise after a dismal reading on Monday of manufacturing orders for the same month.\n\nIndustrial output increased 0.3% in August over July in adjusted terms, the statistical office said. Despite the better-than-expected output, the industry remains in a downturn, the Ministry of Economics said.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year German bund edged down to minus 0.578%, from minus 0.572% Monday afternoon. The yield on 10-year Treasurys also edged down to 1.550%, from 1.552% on Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nIn the U.S., futures on the S&P 500 were down 0.1%.\n\nOn the trade front, China's recent large purchases from the U.S. soybean market have signaled a potential thaw in relations. But China has also sought to narrow the scope of the trade negotiations, putting aside national-security issues and adding to market concerns that an immediate resolution is unlikely.\n\n\"They will not reach an agreement at any price,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at London Capital Group. \"Despite the optimism we see, there's a chance this week ends with another disappointment.\"\n\nOptimism in the U.S.-China negotiations was also visible in commodities prices. Global oil benchmark Brent crude gained 0.7% to $58.75 a barrel, and gold fell 0.5%.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 06:15 ET (10:15 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
