The written complaint describes someone reaching out to Ukrainian officials beforehand to prime them about Zelenskiy playing ball with Trump.\n\nThe White House stopped military assistance approved by Congress for Ukraine before the phone call. The document describes Zelenskiy broaching it with Trump \u2014 and the American president responding with his request for the favor regarding the Biden investigation.\n\nWhat isn't clear yet is whether anyone, per the complaint, did brief the Ukrainians beforehand about the halted assistance and prepare Zelenskiy to ask about it, potentially with the expectation that Trump might ask for something from him.\n\nTrump's attorney, Giuliani, has been a key conduit between the White House and Kyiv. And what members of Congress also want to know is what role, if any, was played by officials or diplomats in the State Department.\n\nThe witnesses\n\nOn Sept. 27, Engel, joined by Reps. Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee and Elijah Cummings of the Oversight Committee, also wrote a letter to schedule the depositions of five State Department officials to be conducted over the next two weeks.\n\n\"The committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election and by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,\" the chairmen wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pompeo accused committee staff of giving inadequate time for deposed individuals to prepare and retain proper legal counsel. He said the committees have also sent \"intimidating communications\" to career department professional outside normal channels.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, backed Pompeo. He accused Democrats of putting \"our nation's diplomatic interests at risk.\"\n\n\"The Democrats are choosing confrontation over cooperation and exploiting their power solely to attack this president and undo the results of the 2016 election,\" Jordan said.", "description": "The secretary of state accused House Democrats of trying to \"intimidate\" and \"bully\" current and former State Department officials by asking them to give depositions over the growing Ukraine scandal.", "authors": ["Franco Ordo\u00f1ez"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/01/gettyimages-1171361584_wide-c917bc9953d392167794ad1c02ae6dc84af16870.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
