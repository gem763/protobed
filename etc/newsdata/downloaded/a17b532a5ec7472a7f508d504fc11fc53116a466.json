No doubt that this sudden U-turn from China extended bearishness in global equity markets.\n\nOn analysis of the movements of and , in different time frames, I find that both the Indian equity indices have shown extended bearishness before closing on October 14th, 2019; finally formed \u201cExhaustive Candle\u201d in their daily charts, which may trigger heavy sell-off on October 15th, 2019. I find that the Nifty 50 may see a downward move below the level of 10,940; which will confirm the formation of this \u201cExhaustive Candle\u201d. No doubt that the weak Indian economic data announced on Monday; looks evident enough to extend bearishness in Indian equity markets which may continue till weekly closing. Secondly, World Bank on Sunday has already slashed its growth forecast for India's current fiscal year to 6% down from 7.5%, warning that the \"severe\" slowdown could further weaken the country's stuttering financial sector. In its last forecast in April, the bank had said that India's economic outlook was strong and expected growth of 7.5% during the current fiscal year that began in April. But Asia's third-largest economy is currently growing at its slowest pace in six years, expanding by just 5% in the April-June quarter, hit by flagging consumer demand and a slackening in government spending.\n\nFinally, I conclude that the steady look evident enough to show the growing concern of global economic slowdown; which may extend more volatility in global equity markets during the upcoming trading sessions. No doubt that the counter comments from the U.S. President on China\u2019s haggling may trigger a heavy sell-off in global equity markets.
