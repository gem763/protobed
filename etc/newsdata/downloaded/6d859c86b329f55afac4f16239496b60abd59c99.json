Its newly created token aims to incentivize and reward companies who are actively participating in a consortium.\n\nIntel\u2019s blockchain program manager Michael Reed told Coindesk that there are three types of tokens: a reward token, a reputation token and a penalty token, adding:\n\n\u201cIt really can be applied to any consortium to incentivize teamwork. The example we are using is a software development consortium like EEA, where we are trying to motivate activities like editing and contributing to specifications, developing and adding code. Then, of course, you could apply penalties for negatives, such as lack of contribution, lack of review, missing deadlines and so on.\u201d\n\nCointelegraph has previously reported on the use of tokens to align and reward companies and individuals for their efforts. The Austrian capital of Vienna was reported to be developing a blockchain-based token as a part of a local incentive program in early 2019.\n\nThe so-called Vienna token would be granted in return for providing feedback about the city, in an application designed to pay for parking within the city, or for rewarding citizens for riding their bikes. The tokens might later be exchanged for something valuable, such as theater tickets.\n\nEEA\u2019s published use cases for telecommunications\n\nIn August, the EEA published a set of use cases for blockchain technology in telecommunications. The list of use cases provided information on how blockchain technology could streamline business transactions and internal operations in the telecommunications industry. Use cases included blockchain-based telecom call roaming user authentication; blockchain-based telecom call roaming reconciliation; and data privacy and monetization.", "description": "The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance created a new system of reward tokens that receives the backing of software giant Microsoft and Intel", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kMTg5MzQ4NDM4ZDNhNWFkYTBkMzQ4NDA1NDU4NjlmMi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
