We would say that should happen as soon as possible.\"\n\nChi-X chairman David Morgan said he understood the legislation was scheduled for introduction in the middle of next year, \"and we want to make sure that doesn't get pushed back, given the plethora of royal commission and other legislation going through''.\n\n\"We are engaged in a very active dialogue at the highest level, of bureaucrats and politicians involved in this, to make sure there's no slippage,\" Dr Morgan said.\n\n\"It is a little toothless until you have the legislative backing [which would be] a very helpful, significant, competitive move forward.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the ASX said the issue was a matter for government. \"We are continuing to engage closely with government and regulators, including the ACCC, throughout our CHESS replacement program.\n\n\"We are focused on building a platform for the future that will stimulate further innovation and competition.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Jokovic also said Chi-X was not getting access to the ASX's new blockchain technology, which was hampering its ability to innovate in post-trade services.\n\n\"We want to get access to this infrastructure from the start, so we can innovate on it, but we are not allowed to ... We are pushing billions of dollars of orders across but we can't have a node,\" he said, referring to a blockchain connection with the ASX.\n\nIt is understood that Chi-X has not applied for a node.\n\nChi-X specifically raised concerns about the ASX enhancing the functionality of its MFund platform, which enables investors to buy and sell units in selected unlisted managed funds.\n\nMr Somes said this competes with parts of Chi-X, but via the CHESS replacement project, ASX is seeking to enhance MFund which \"may give it an advantage over us\".\n\n\"So what you see connected is the way ASX can use a monopoly business to advantage those areas where it is in competition,\" he said.\n\nChi-X supports the CHESS replacement project for updating messaging protocols, but Mike Aikins, chief operating and technology officer, said this did not require a distributed ledger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you look how ASX is implementing it, it is not 'distributed' at all - it is sitting in the ASX data centre, on ASX computers run by ASX,'' he said.\n\nThe concerns of Chi-X echo those of the new CHESS Replacement Stakeholder Group, which includes Link Market Services, Computershare and various industry associations.\n\n\"The replacement project over-reaches functionality that is necessary and justified, and positions its operator to extend its monopoly to take up currently competitive post-trade settlement activities,'' the group said in a document seen by The Australian Financial Review.\n\n\"The industry has raised concerns that the ASX could be abusing the market power of its natural monopoly to subsequently extend it.''\n\nCompetition yet to emerge\n\nThe Council of Financial Regulators said in its 2015 report it would lift the moratorium on consideration of a licence application from a competing clearing provider, but recognised competition may not emerge, so \"the relevant regulators should have powers to deal with an ongoing monopoly\".\n\nThe London Clearing House (LCH) has considered entering the Australian market but it is understood it decided not to due to strict requirements that significant regulatory capital against clearing activity be held in Australia.\n\n\"I would argue the RBA made a mistake there, because it had an opportunity to bring a big global clearing competitor into the country but they weren't flexible around capital, and now perhaps LCH is no longer interested in coming into Australia because it has more significant markets to be looking at,\" Mr Jokovic said.\n\nSETL, another London-based clearing operator, said in 2017 it wanted to compete with ASX, but similarly, this hasn't materialised.", "description": "Chi-X chairman David Morgan says the exchange is talking to Canberra about legislating to create tougher oversight of the ASX.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.498%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1080%2C$y_251/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/55a5606da88fc242ff6c180ff22029eaebd216a3", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
