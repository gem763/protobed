An estimated 225,000 Burundians still live in three camps in Tanzania.\n\nWith elections due in Burundi next year, observers have been warning of a new risk of lethal violence in a country that hundreds continue to flee each week.\n\nConcern has been mounting since Tanzania\u2019s interior minister, Kangi Lugola, said in August that from 1 October, all Burundian refugees would be sent back home, arguing that their home was now at peace.\n\nGovernment spokesman Hassan Abbas said on Thursday that \u201cnobody will be forced to go back\u201d \u2013 although he nevertheless insisted that \u201cBurundi is peaceful and they are busy preparing for elections next year\u201d.\n\n\u201cTanzania respects the international agreements on refugees and will ensure the refugees\u2019 relocation process is handled carefully,\u201d Abbas told reporters.\n\nBurundi has been in crisis since 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza ran for a third term and was re-elected in a vote boycotted by most of the opposition.\n\nAt least 1,200 people were killed and more than 400,000 displaced in violence between April 2015 and May 2017 that the UN has said was mostly carried out by state security forces.\n\nIn August, the UNHCR said in a statement: \u201cWhile overall security has improved, UNHCR is of the opinion conditions in Burundi are not currently conducive to promote returns.\u201d\n\nThe UNHCR added: \u201cHundreds still flee Burundi each month, and UNHCR urges governments in the region to maintain open borders and access to asylum for those who need it.\u201d\n\nBurundian refugees in the camps who spoke to AFP by phone said the situation was calm and that those seeking to return voluntarily were registering with authorities.\n\nTanzania president under fire for urging refugees to return to 'stable' Burundi Read more\n\nHowever, they said some had chosen to flee to Uganda, Rwanda or Kenya because of pressure to return back to Burundi.\n\n\u201cAt first they banned leaving the camp to work in the fields of Tanzanians, then they closed the shops, the bars inside the camps. Most recently they closed the markets,\u201d said one refugee in the Nduta camp, in the north-west of the country.\n\nThe UNHCR said 590 Burundian refugees had returned on flights that it had organised with the International Organization for Migration.\n\nThe UNHCR said it had it had not promoted the repatriation programme, but was ready to help anyone who wanted to go back.\n\n\u201cWe urge the governments of Tanzania and Burundi to respect their commitments to uphold international obligations and ensure that any refugee returns remain voluntary and that no refugee or asylum seeker is returned to Burundi against their will,\u201d the agency added in a statement.", "description": "Burundians who fled political violence at home complain of pressure tactics as 600 people are repatriated voluntarily", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4fa43699bd71a659c5255d71de359c92d857b58/0_30_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4ae64be4586ee7f6a533c6df00399533", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
