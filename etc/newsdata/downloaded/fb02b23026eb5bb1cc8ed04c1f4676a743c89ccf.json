The closer you are to a rail hub, the better, as it means you won\u2019t have to carry heavy luggage far, and you\u2019ll have a number of transport and dining options right at your doorstep.\n\nIf you\u2019re a true fan of Japanese trains, though, you\u2019ll want to be as close to a station as possible, and for that, we\u2019ve found the perfect hotel, where guests can close their eyes at night to the comforting clickety-clack of the rails and open their eyes to a view of them upon rising in the morning.\n\n\u25bc The hotel is located inside the Tagawa Ita Station building in Fukuoka.\n\nThe Tagawa Ita Station Hotel is unusual in that it\u2019s approximately zero minutes away from the station. In fact, it takes you just seconds to get from the platform to the hotel itself, with its lobby located on the second floor, accessible by stairs or elevator.\n\nThe station itself was renovated in 2018, and the hotel had its grand opening just last month, so this is one of the cleanest and newest places you can stay in the area.\n\nThe entrance to the hotel acts like the doors to a train carriage, with \u201cRomango\u201d (\u201cRomance Car\u201c) written in a retro rail-type font on a bright red sign above the doorway.\n\nDespite being fully renovated, the station and the hotel itself retains a lot of traditional old-world charm, with retro wallpaper, carpet and light fittings recreating the interior of a classy train from the Showa period (1926-1989).\n\n\u25bc The doors are designed to look like entrances to private cabins as well.\n\nOne thing guests should be aware of when making a booking at this hotel is the fact that the view from the rooms can be very different, depending on which side of the hotel you stay. If you end up in rooms 8, 9, 10, or 11, you\u2019ll have a view of the street.\n\nWhich is perfectly fine if you want to be away from the noise of the passing trains and don\u2019t mind a view of the quiet roads outside the station.\n\nHowever, if you really want to enjoy a unique experience, you\u2019ll want to book yourself into one of the rooms from 1-5, as this is where you\u2019ll get to see this.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 directly outside the windows of these rooms are the station tracks, which come with a direct view of the platform, and the trains as they come through.\n\nThe hotel has been dubbed \u201cthe closest hotel to a train station platform in Japan\u201c, and it\u2019s easy to see why. With your bed just meters away from the tracks, the trains go right by your room, and you can even open your window to feel even closer to the carriages.\n\nWhile the unusual view is enough of a drawcard on its own, the compact rooms are equally attractive, accommodating one to four people, depending on your requirements.\n\nGuests can use the shared bathroom and kitchen facilities, which are all spotless and well-maintained.\n\nThe hotel provides each guest with a generous amount of free goods for them to use during their stay, including bath, body and face towels, pajamas, slippers, a toothbrush, hairbrush, razor, and even a set of earphones and earplugs, for those who might not like the sound of trains outside the window.\n\nAnd with three different beds to choose from in this particular trackside room, you can either sleep right next to the trains by the window, or shelter inside the bunk bed area, which offers a little more peace and privacy.\n\nFor those who do like the comforting sound of trains, you\u2019ll be lulled to sleep by their sweet lullaby, at least until the last train of the evening rolls by at 11:46 p.m. And when you wake in the morning, hopefully after the first train of the day at 5:42 a.m., you\u2019ll be able to see just how close your room was to the railway tracks.\n\nA one-night stay without meals at Tagawa Ita Station Hotel starts at just 2,200 yen per person, with prices varying according to season. Check in is from 3 p.m.-11 p.m., and checkout is at 10 a.m., which means you can relax in your room until a couple of minutes before your train departs, seeing as it\u2019ll be right outside.\n\nAnd if one night by the rails just isn\u2019t enough, you can always check to see if there are any apartments available to rent in this building on top of a railway station, so you can live the rail life every day of the year.\n\nHotel information\n\nTagawa Ita Station Hotel / \u7530\u5ddd\u4f0a\u7530\u99c5\u820e\u30db\u30c6\u30eb\n\nAddress: Fukuoka-ken, Tagawa-shi, Oaza Ita 2621-1\n\n\u798f\u5ca1\u770c\u7530\u5ddd\u5e02\u5927\u5b57\u4f0a\u75302621-1\n\nWebsite\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Tokyo Dome-area capsule hotel accepts female guest, offers free noodles, and has a gorgeous bath\n\n-- Hotel guests get a Halloween fright as their hotels are transformed \u3010Photos\u3011\n\n-- Budget accommodation in Japan lets you stay for less than 18 bucks a night!\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/15/sleep-next-to-the-railroad-tracks-at-the-closest-hotel-to-a-train-station-platform-in-japan/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "One of the most important deciding factors when it comes to choosing a hotel in Japan is its distance from the station.
