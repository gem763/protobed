Investigating committees are set to get key evidence today when a former Army officer assigned to the White House National Security Council testifies he listened to Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president and was so disturbed by it that he reported it to the NSC\u2019s legal counsel.\n\nWith the probe poised to move into its public phase \u2014 and more testimony to come \u2014 Republicans may one day rue demanding to formally weigh in this early in the process.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nErdogan\u2019s edge? | Trump\u2019s White House once explored whether the U.S. could cut off taxpayer funding for a network of charter schools affiliated with a political opponent of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Jennifer Jacobs, Saleha Mohsin and Nick Wadhams report. The 2017 episode could raise more difficult questions for Trump about his relationship with Erdogan, whose military operation this month in Syria has drawn fire from fellow Republicans.\n\nThe U.S. House will vote today on a bipartisan bill to sanction Turkey over its campaign in northern Syria.\n\nTry, try again | British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will try for a fourth time today to persuade Parliament to approve a snap election so he can win the majority he needs to ratify his deal to pull the U.K. out of the European Union. One thing\u2019s certain: He\u2019s failed in his \u201cdo-or-die\u201d pledge to make Brexit a reality by Oct. 31. Click here to read about how the twists in Brexit point to an upcoming ballot.\n\nThe U.K. treasury will melt down thousands of 50-pence coins minted to commemorate Brexit on Oct. 31 after Johnson accepted an extension from the EU, Jessica Shankleman and Alex Morales report.\n\nNo vote | Hong Kong disqualified prominent activist Joshua Wong from running in November local elections, a hit to protesters\u2019 efforts to win greater sway in the city after months of demonstrations against China\u2019s influence. Wong has supported \u201cself-determination\u201d for the financial hub, a position authorities equate with advocating independence.\n\nSigns of trouble | Joe Biden risks a potentially crippling third- or fourth-place finish in the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses. Tyler Pager spoke to nearly a dozen senior Democrats in the state and reports what they see as a poorly organized operation that has failed to engage with voters and party leaders. Top Democrats say that could set Biden \u2014 the presumed front-runner \u2014 finishing behind Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg or others.\n\nAll change | Fresh from winning Sunday\u2019s election, President-elect Alberto Fernandez is signaling an abrupt change in Argentina\u2019s foreign policy. Out goes any semblance of good relations with neighboring Brazil and in come warmer ties with Mexico, Bolivia \u2014 and perhaps Venezuela. As Juan Pablo Spinetto reports, if Fernandez weakens ties with Washington, it could open the door for greater cooperation with Beijing.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nLebanon\u2019s central bank governor is warning that a political solution is needed within \u201cdays\u201d to avoid economic collapse and restore public confidence after 12 days of anti-government protests. General Motors, Toyota and several other automakers plan to intervene on the Trump administration\u2019s behalf in a contentious battle with Californian officials over automobile emissions rules. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is set to express sadness over two deadly 737 Max crashes and acknowledge \u201cmistakes\u201d during a high-stakes appearance before U.S. lawmakers today. Italian right-wing populist Matteo Salvini, who staged a failed summer coup, is back after scoring a thumping win in a local election in a region that had been a safe center-left stronghold for half a century.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for the\u00a0Balance of Power\u00a0newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for more.Nancy Pelosi\u2019s plan for an impeachment-related House vote this week threatens to put Donald Trump\u2019s defenders in a tight spot.The", "authors": ["Kathleen Hunter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0_9JfV61VCnhvYVu54klvA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/7fb326010e6c01aefc8f4527e1431ffa", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
