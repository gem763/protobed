You see, Chatha is basically two different people.\n\nBy day, he's Neal Chatha, a laid back 28-year-old who lives in Calgary and likes to watch Star Wars movies and spend time with his dog.\n\nBut for millions of fans around the world, he's known as The PropheC, an international Punjabi music star who blends Indian music with modern day hip-hop. His latest album The Season hit number one on the Billboard charts in India while also topping the world music charts in the U.K., Norway and the U.S.\n\nAnd when Chatha describes the two sides of his personality, he talks like they are polar opposites.\n\n\"Over the last few years I've actually worked to make them very different. Neal loves to live a very simple life. He's easy-going, likes to laugh a lot and tell jokes whereas The PropheC is very aware of his feelings. He's mysterious, detail oriented, and a bit of a perfectionist.\"\n\nOh, and The PropheC doesn't smile. Not even a little.\n\nIt turns out, when Chatha was crafting his artistic persona, he was doing a lot of photo shoots but didn't quite know who The PropheC was yet. Over the years, he found three or four poses that felt good and it just so happened that none of them involved a smile.\n\nThat may be the most telling difference between Neal and The PropheC \u2014 Neal is all laughs. And, although they are worlds apart, he doesn't seem fazed by his double life as a Punjabi superstar.\n\n\"I remember when I was in university, I'd do these crazy club shows at midnight in New York or in the U.K. and I'd get back to the hotel, write an essay, take a flight and in the morning I'd be in class listening to my professor. It just felt so surreal. Like, what just happened?\"\n\nThe PropheC performs at a recent concert in Toronto. (Submitted by Neal Chatha)\n\nBut the biggest moment for Neal happened when he took a trip to India with his dad Daljit Chatha.\n\nOne of the first things the Chathas did when they arrived was post a picture on social media saying that he was there. The photo was of his aunt's house. No big deal, right?\n\n\"Suddenly, 30 or 40 people showed up at the front because they recognized the area,\" says Chatha, sounding as shocked as the day it happened.\n\n\"They rang the gate at my aunt's house so she answered the door, and all of these people are like, 'We're here to see The PropheC!' and she's like, 'What the heck is a PropheC? I don't know what that is, but you guys have to get off my lawn'! I felt so bad because my aunt had no idea.\"\n\nEven though his aunt was a bit shocked, it was his father's reaction that surprised him the most.\n\nNeal Chatha - also known as The PropheC - with his Dad, Daljit Chatha. (Submitted by Neal Chatha)\n\n\"That was the turning point for me,\" says Daljit Chatha, who up until that trip hadn't been convinced of his son's ambitions as a hip-hop artist.\n\n\"Neal proved to me that he was on the right path.\"\n\n\"Whatever city we were in, people were waiting to meet him and take pictures. So finally I nodded and said: 'Well you won,' and I started supporting whatever he did after that day. I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\nBut while The PropheC has found musical stardom, that doesn't mean Neal is treated like a star when he's at home.\n\n\"If I come back from a tour, or playing a show, my Mom will say, 'Oh, you're The PropheC? Well, The PropheC can take out the garbage and The PropheC can go do his chores. They're really good at keeping me in check.\"", "description": "Neal Chatha is a laid back 28-year-old who lives in Calgary and likes to watch Star Wars.
