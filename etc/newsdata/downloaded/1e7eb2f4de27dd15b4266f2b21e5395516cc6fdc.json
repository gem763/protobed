However, did the Duchess of Sussex \u2014 who has been known to buck some royal traditions \u2014 actually break protocol when she went in for a hug? A royal etiquette expert says no, it was just a case of bad timing.\n\n\u201cWith royal protocol, it\u2019s most respectful to wait until the royal extends a handshake, touch or a hug, and you follow their lead,\u201d Myka Meier, author of Modern Etiquette Made Easy, tells PEOPLE. \u201cWhile although Meghan was initially greeted with a curtsy, which would have been a respectful way to greet a member of the royal family in this situation, it\u2019s clear Meghan was trying to show warmth through her offer to hug as a greeting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this case, Meghan initiated a hug and the woman [One Young World Summit co-founder Kate Robertson] followed suit, which was perfectly fine. Sometimes it is all a matter of missed timing, not necessarily a break in protocol, and perhaps an earlier curtness would have allowed for both a curtsy and a hug after, but only if the senior royal initiated it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Meghan has known Robertson for several years through her work with One Young World, which explains the familiarity between the two women during their greeting.\n\nGARETH FULLER/POOL/AFP via Getty More\n\nKate Robertson (left) and Meghan Markle | Gareth Fuller/PA Images More\n\nRELATED: See Meghan Markle\u2019s Perfect Curtsy to the Queen (and How Much It\u2019s Improved Since Last Christmas!)\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Los Angeles-born Meghan would naturally go for the very American greeting of a hug, over a curtsy. However, according to Meier, it is possible to mix a curtsy with a hug or handshake, which is something that we\u2019ve seen Kate Middleton do before.\n\n\u201cOften we see The Duchess of Cambridge curtsy and then give the Queen a second greeting, which is a perfect example of how you can do both with a bit of timing.\u201d\n\nFrom left: Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry | Chris Jackson/Getty Images More\n\nRELATED: Who Does Meghan Markle Have to Curtsy to \u2014 and Who Will Bend and Bow to Her?\n\nSo, just remember: if you every find yourself about to greet a royal, just follow their lead \u2014 or get your curtsy out of the way when they are still out of hugging distance.", "description": "Meghan Markle Hugs and Rejects Curtsy: Did It Break Protocol?", "authors": ["Maria Mercedes Lara"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PcMGwK9ZG3QuOdtyOcUYnw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/tardis/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeopledotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2019%2F10%2Fmeghan-2-2.jpg&h=1000&f=jpg&q=80", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
