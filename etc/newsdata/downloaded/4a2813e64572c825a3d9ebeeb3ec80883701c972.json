Opening the door to a Turkish invasion, abandoning our Kurdish allies, emboldening Syria, Russia and Iran, and standing aside while casualties and refugees mount \u2014 it is hard to imagine a more calamitous spur-of-the-moment decision.\n\nThe danger is that the opportunity to trash Trump will revive an interventionist temper among Democrats. After Clinton\u2019s vote for the Iraq War cost her dearly against both Barack Obama and Donald Trump, even establishment Democrats began to realize that the public was tired of endless wars. Before Trump\u2019s Syrian debacle, virtually all Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Warren (Mass.) and Gabbard (Hawaii) \u2014 expressed strong opposition to the wars in the Middle East. During the September Houston presidential debate, even Biden said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need those troops there. I would bring them home.\u201d Buttigieg, a veteran of the conflict in Afghanistan, said that even if U.S. commanders cautioned against withdrawal, \u201cwe have got to put an end to endless war.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut since Trump\u2019s change of heart on Syria, the tone among Democrats has changed. Biden, who has always reserved a role for military force in the Middle East, took a shot at Warren\u2019s commitment to bring the troops home, saying, \u201cLeading the free world requires us to show up, have some skin in the game,\u201d suggesting he\u2019d reduce our forces but maintain bases in Pakistan and elsewhere with troops able to respond to potential threats.\n\nButtigieg, a former U.S. Naval Reserve officer, who has made himself the voice of a national security establishment outraged by Trump\u2019s heresies, now rejects any proposal to \u201ccompletely withdraw\u201d troops from the Middle East. It will be \u201cmessy,\u201d he says, but U.S. troops will be there \u201cfor as long as I am alive.\u201d Buttigieg now argues that the U.S. deployment in Syria \u2014 a \u201clight footprint\u201d of 1,000 soldiers \u2014 should be the model for Afghanistan.\n\nMore broadly, Clinton, still embittered by her 2016 loss to Trump, put a despicable edge on the debate, warning that Gabbard, who called on Democrats to reject \u201cregime change wars\u201d during the last debate, was possibly being used by Russia as a third-party spoiler. Like other contenders, Gabbard has repeatedly denied any intention of running on a third-party ticket. Once again, those who challenge the failed policies of the establishment are tarred as apologists or worse.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe problem with the revived interventionist position is that it makes little sense. The United States has been fighting in Afghanistan for 18 years with no end in sight. The U.S. position in Syria \u2014 an armed occupation by a token force inside a foreign country without permission or legal mandate \u2014 was eroding long before Trump acted. Neither the Syrians nor the Turks were about to allow the Kurds to consolidate an independent region within Syria. If either decided to act, the United States had no desire to escalate to stop them.\n\nWith a competent president, a negotiated agreement might have allowed for a less destabilizing withdrawal. In both Syria and Afghanistan, however, our opponents are unlikely to make major concessions to a force that is on its way out. But in Afghanistan, the Trump administration\u2019s effort at negotiation with the Taliban has collapsed; in Syria, Trump didn\u2019t even try. Instead, Trump gave the green light to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to invade, and dispatched 3,000 more troops to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Biden-Buttigieg posture is a classic example of the crackpot realism of the bipartisan national security establishment. The United States, the \u201cindispensable nation,\u201d can police the far corners of the globe, with a little \u201cskin in the game\u201d \u2014 \u201djust a few dozen troops, special operators in just the right places,\u201d Buttigieg suggests. The inevitable result is wars without victory and without end.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn an op-ed for The Post, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) offered bipartisan support for this course, arguing for creating \u201cconditions for the reintroduction of U.S. troops,\u201d retaining \u201ca limited military presence in Syria,\" and maintaining \u201cour presence in Iraq and elsewhere in the region.\u201d Scorning the \u201cneo-isolationism\u201d of talk about endless wars, he concluded that \u201cAmerica\u2019s wars will be \u2018endless\u2019 only if America refuses to win them.\u201d He\u2019s right. What is clear in Afghanistan and Syria is that neither the Democrats nor the Republicans, neither Obama nor Trump, neither the Democratic House nor the Republican Senate, neither Biden nor Buttigieg is prepared to commit the forces and resources needed to \u201cwin.\u201d Instead, they will spend enough in lives and resources to avoid losing.\n\nTrump\u2019s toxic combination of arrogance and ignorance, his desire to pose as both the tough guy and the peacemaker are truly destructive. But so, too, is the establishment assumption that the United States can police the world with a \u201clight footprint\u201d without finding ourselves mired in endless wars for which we lack the will either to win or to end.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The danger in criticizing the president's policies is that it could revive an interventionist temper on the left.", "authors": ["Katrina Vanden Heuvel", "Columnist Covering National Politics", "Progressive Politics", "Movements", "Foreign Policy"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rBwuf0qFWwlaxMnMXyyEoNTHMm0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZX6522HUGEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
