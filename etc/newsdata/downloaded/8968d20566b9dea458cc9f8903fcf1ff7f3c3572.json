Another feature allows users in Lagos to seek directions from \"informal transit\" services, such as private minibuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram and Nneka Chile; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)", "description": "Global ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] on Friday launched a pilot test of a boat service in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos to attract commuters seeking to avoid the megacity's notoriously congested roads.
