Its course remains unresolved despite more than 20 rounds of talks.\n\nModi took Xi on a personal tour of temple monuments dating back to the seventh and eighth century at Mamallapuram in southern India when regional leaders had trade ties with Chinese provinces.\n\nIndia's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said the two leaders spent nearly five hours discussing bilateral issues that have often been fraught.\n\nThe two leaders discussed economic issues, including India's $53 billion trade deficit with China in 2018/19, and ways to tackle it, Gokhale said.\n\nChina, for its part, was expected to urge India to take an independent decision on telecom equipment maker Huawei's bid for India's proposed 3G network and not be swayed by U.S. pressure. The United States has asked its allies not to use Huawei equipment, which it says China could exploit for spying.\n\nSources told Reuters in August that China had warned of \"reverse sanctions\" on Indian firms engaged in business in China should India block Huawei Technologies HWT.UL because of U.S. pressure. will head to Nepal later on Saturday where he is expected to push for China's further involvement in developing its infrastructure as part of his signature One Belt On Road initiative to boost trade and transport links across Asia.", "description": "UPDATE 1-China's Xi and India's Modi discuss proposals to improve ties hit by Kashmir", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_5_800x533_L_1412601619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
