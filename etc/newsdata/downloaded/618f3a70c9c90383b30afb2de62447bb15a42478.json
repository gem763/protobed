He's too small for me. He does a lot of movement but that doesn't faze me.\n\nAsked who the biggest threat to him is, Wilder replied: 'Myself. I have something that I've been blessed with. It lasts from the first to the 12th - it never goes away.\n\nWilder thinks his size and power advantage puts him on another level to Usyk\n\n'It's amazing because I don't even know the strength of my own power. I hold my fiancee's hand and she says: 'Baby, you're squeezing me too tight'. I am very heavy handed.\n\n'The speed is the power but I already have the power. So when all that comes together, when lightning and power transfers from point A to point B? Bam, baby. Goodnight.'\n\nWilder is preparing to take on Luis Ortiz in defence of his WBC belt on November 23 and will fight Tyson Fury again in the New Year.\n\nUsyk is preparing to make his heavyweight debut against Chazz Witherspoon\n\nUsyk believes Wilder would be his easiest challenge at heavyweight and Tyson Fury would be his toughest test.\n\nHe told Behind the Gloves: 'The hardest would be Tyson Fury. And Deontay Wilder is the easiest. I just want to fight him. He has the belt.\n\n'If [Fury] wants to face me with one hand behind him, okay. I will accept that. It\u2019s even easier.\n\n'But let me define what his real thoughts are, because one day he says I\u2019m good and the next day he says I\u2019m not good.'", "description": "Deontay Wilder has dismissed Oleksandr Usyk's chances of becoming heavyweight champion as he is 'too small'.", "authors": ["Will Griffee For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/12/19625068-0-image-a-37_1570880172888.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
