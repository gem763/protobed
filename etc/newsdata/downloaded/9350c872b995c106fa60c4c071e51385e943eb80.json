The rookie from France had scored 21 points in her previous game.\n\nThe Mystics, who have won four straight, signed Tianna Hawkins, a former first-round pick, to a contract extension through the 2020 season, then rested her against the Liberty. Kristi Toliver missed her ninth straight game because of a knee injury that is expected to keep her out until the playoffs.\n\nSTORM 82, MERCURY 70\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Natasha Howard scored 11 of her 22 points in the first quarter and the Storm got off to a strong start en route to a win over the Mercury.\n\nSeattle (17-15) moved into a tie with Minnesota for the sixth seed and holds the tiebreaker. The Mercury (15-17) will finish eighth. When the playoffs open next week, the fifth and sixth seeds have home games and the seventh and eighth seeds are on the road in the single-elimination first round.\n\nThe Storm shot 58% in the first quarter to 39% for the Mercury and steadily pulled away.

Ogwumike started for her sister Nneka, who was out with an illness that sidelined her for the second half of the team\u2019s last game against Las Vegas.\n\nAfter trailing by 11 after one quarter, the Sparks rallied in the second quarter, took the lead in the third and held off Atlanta to move a full game ahead of fifth-place Chicago with two games to play.\n\nThe Sparks (20-12) have won 12 straight at home, where they play their last two games. Los Angeles coach Derek Fisher became the ninth WNBA head coach to get to 20 wins in their first season. The record is 29 by the Sparks\u2019 Michael Cooper in 2000.\n\nAtlanta shot 55% in the first quarter to 33% for the Sparks but a 7-0 run helped Los Angeles take a brief lead before the Dream took a 35-34 lead into the break. It was 51-45 for the Sparks after three quarters. The teams combined to go 7 of 40 from 3-point range.\n\nAlex Bentley, who did not score in the second half, and Elizabeth Williams each had 15 points for Atlanta (7-25).
