The change was widely expected, with Roy having scored just 62 runs in six outings at the top of the order.\n\nEngland still believe the World Cup-winning batsman can be a success in the longer format but have bowed to the inevitable by taking him out of the new-ball firing line. Instead, Kent batsman Denly will return to the spot where he made his Test debut over the winter and Roy will take up residence at number four.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Steve Smith seizes second chance in Ashes tale of two redemptions | Matthew Engel Read more\n\n\u201cI got a call from [captain] Joe Root after a bit of time off and he said he\u2019d like me to go at the top of the order and try to get us off to a good start,\u201d Denly told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nRoy will now have the chance to prove his prowess in the middle order, a role he has fulfilled for the majority of his first-class career with Surrey.\n\n\u201cObviously Jason is going to bat four and that\u2019s great for English cricket,\u201d said Denly. \u201cWith Jason Roy in the team we are a better team and with him coming in at four, hopefully with the new ball worn off and myself and Rory Burns doing our job at the top, it allows him to come in and play his way. He\u2019s a great player to have there.\u201d\n\nDenly made six and 17 in his only previous outing as an opener, in Antigua this January, but showed his ability to focus and bat time by gritting out an important half-century in England\u2019s famous series-levelling win at Headingley.\n\nHis efforts, as well as those of Root (77), have largely been forgotten in the aftermath of Ben Stokes\u2019 brilliant match-winning century but he is happy to go under the radar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit of a blur \u2026 it\u2019s all about the last hour,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously it was a proud moment but as any top-order batter, you come off after getting out wanting more runs. Having made 50 it would have been nice to go on and get a bigger score, but thankfully we had \u2018King Stokes\u2019 coming in and finishing it for us.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to sink in for a while. It was a remarkable day and one that will be remembered forever, so to be part of it was very special.\u201d", "description": "Joe Denly has confirmed he will switch places with Jason Roy and open the batting for England in the fourth Ashes Test on Wednesday", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33773143422bafb832c2620929fc2e9efd26862d/0_50_3411_2048/master/3411.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a0763049d24d8b3bfff7f14a3884817"}
