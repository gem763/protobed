I find that this series of futile attempts made by Nifty ensures the probabilities of a gap-down on September 16th, 2019; because the Indian economy has not seen any major change at the national level. All fundamentals which have been constantly putting bearish pressure on Nifty 50 remain the same.

The next decision from the RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) is due on Oct. 4. I find that a rally in stock prices will run out of steam soon. It is typical buy-on-rumor-sell-on-fact trade on central bank stimulus and will be over by the Fed and the BOJ's meetings.\n\nNifty 50 - 1 Hr.
