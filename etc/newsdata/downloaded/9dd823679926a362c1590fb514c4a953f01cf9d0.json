The fund was up 48.9% year-to-date as of June 30, according to its website.\n\nPershing Square took major losses several years ago on a $1 billion bet against Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company.\n\nRead more: Jim Rogers earned a 4,200% return with George Soros by investing in overlooked assets.
