WJAC reported other aspects of the gun control banned \u201cmost uses of armor-piercing ammunition and high-capacity magazines.\u201d The controls signed by Peduto were also intended to allow guns to be seized from individuals via a Red Flag Law.\n\nWESA reported Allegheny County Judge Joseph James found all the controls \u201cvoid and unenforceable,\u201d due to the state\u2019s preemption statute.\n\nA preemption law means a city or municipality is barred from passing gun controls that exceed those existing at the state level.\n\nBREAKING: @NRAILA applauded the Allegheny Court of Common Pleas for protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners in Pennsylvania. In the NRA-backed case, the court found that Pittsburgh's attempt to impose local gun control was a violation of state law. https://t.co/ZNkQhg1HCy \u2014 NRA (@NRA) October 29, 2019\n\nThe NRA-ILA\u2019s Jason Ouimet praised the ruling, saying, \u201cThis is a huge victory for law-abiding gun owners and everyone who values freedom in the Keystone state.
