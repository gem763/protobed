The 340 million projection is well above the previous estimate of 80 million.\n\nThe report, from Climate Central and published in the journal Nature Communications, paints a harrowing picture for most of Asia as sea levels are projected to rise between 0.6m and 2.1m.\n\nBy 2100, with the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet already worsening, as many as 640 million people could be threatened by rising sea levels.\n\nUsing a form of artificial intelligence known as neural networks, the new research corrects ground elevation data that has up to now vastly underestimated the extent to which coastal zones are subject to flooding during high tide or major storms.\n\n\u201cSea-level projections have not changed,\u201d co-author Ben Strauss, chief scientist and CEO of Climate Central, said.\n\n\u201cBut when we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas that we previously understood.\u201d\n\nPrevious data on rising sea levels made the crisis seem manageable but as Mr Strauss said, governments must act on these new maps to avoid \u201ceconomic and humanitarian catastrophe\u201d.\n\nWith the global population is set to increase two billion by 2050 and another billion by 2100 \u2014 mostly in coastal megacities \u2014 even greater numbers of people will be forced to adapt or move out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nAlready today, there are more than 100 million people living below high tide levels, the study found. Some are protected by dikes and levees, most are not.\n\nChina\u2019s low cities are particularly at risk including Shanghai and Tianjin. Hong Kong also faces severe flooding risks by 2050 while the report projects much of the southern part of Vietnam could also be wiped out.\n\nHo Chi Minh City is in the south of Vietnam, the country\u2019s largest and most populated city.\n\nThe numbers at risk of an annual flood by 2050 in Bangladesh also increased more than eightfold in the study.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just Asia that will face inundation by 2050.\n\nParts of Brazil and the UK could see permanent land loss by 2100. The report estimates more than 3.6 million Brits could be at risk of annual flooding by 2050.\n\n\u201cIf our findings stand, coastal communities worldwide must prepare themselves for much more difficult futures than may be currently anticipated,\u201d the study warned.\n\n\u201cRecent work has suggested that, even in the US, sea-level rise this century may induce large-scale migration away from unprotected coastlines, redistributing population density across the country and putting great pressure on inland areas.\u201d\n\nThe report will leave millions of people around the world questioning how long they want to live on the coast, lead author and Climate Central scientist Scott Kulp said.\n\n\u201cClimate change has the potential to reshape cities, economies, coastlines and entire global regions within our lifetime,\u201d Mr Kulp said.\n\n\u201cAs the tideline rises higher than the ground people call home, nations will increasingly confront questions about whether, how much and how long coastal defences can protect them.\u201d\n\nSeveral factors conspire to threaten populations living within a few metres of sea level.\n\nOne is the expansion of water as it warms and, more recently, ice sheets atop Greenland and Antarctica that have shed more than 430 billion tonnes per year over the last decade.\n\nSince 2006, the waterline has gone up nearly four millimetres a year, a pace that could increase 100-fold going into the 22nd century if carbon emissions continue unabated, the UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) warned in a major report last month.\n\nMajor storms that until recently occurred once a century will, by 2050, happen on average once a year in many places, especially in the tropics, the IPCC report found.\n\nAnnual coastal flood damages are projected to increase 100 to 1,000-fold by 2100, it said.\n\nFinally, many of the one billion people living at less than nine metres above sea level today are in urban areas literally sinking under their own weight.\n\n\u2014 With AAP", "description": "In just 30 years, a whopping 340 million people living on the coast can expect annual flooding or permanent inundation, according to a grim new report released by scientists.", "authors": ["Natalie Wolfe"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c010c6bf13935af93c20de4b6b39a0fa?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
