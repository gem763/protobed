He is in the groove and playing with confidence.\n\nHenry Slade's selection for England could prove to be a masterstroke by Eddie Jones\n\nJones has made big calls this week, such as selecting Owen Farrell ahead of George Ford\n\nThe switch on Saturday could be a masterstroke, though.\n\nWhen I look at the composition of the side Eddie has picked, I see a fantastic line-up capable of winning the World Cup and most certainly a team who can win well against the Aussies.\n\nThe biggest factor here is that only Eddie and his backroom staff will have known that Slade is fit and good to start after his injury problems.\n\nHis limited game-time and strapped knee led me to assume that he wasn\u2019t quite there yet. Slade at 100 per cent, however, changes the equation significantly because Eddie now has the option of picking a midfield of Farrell-Tuilagi-Slade that took Ireland apart in February.\n\nThat startling win in Dublin against the then Grand Slam champions was unquestionably the best of Eddie\u2019s four seasons in charge. The Farrell-Tuilagi-Slade combination will have been at the forefront of his thinking once Slade became available to start.\n\nThe Dublin win was world class in every respect and now, in the most important game of his career since the 2003 World Cup final, Eddie has instinctively gone back to that core line-up.\n\nHe has also stated Ford will finish the match against Australia.\n\nIn leaving Ford out, Jones has the option of going with the Farrell-Slade-Tuilagi combination\n\nHe is not merely an option off the bench, Ford will take control from fly-half in the final segment of the match. Eddie has a specific plan here.\n\nFrom the moment England\u2019s match against France was cancelled and Australia were confirmed as quarter-final opponents, that option became more and more attractive, simply because of the way Australia play.\n\nTheir midfield has been a mess. Their half-back combination on Saturday will be their sixth different line-up in the last six games. But the one constant, their main \u2014 if limited \u2014 tactic, has been for big Samu Kerevi to blast up through the 10-12 channel.\n\nThat being the case, you can see the attraction of putting the hugely physical Farrell at 10 for the first part of the match.\n\nThen, later in the game, when hopefully England\u2019s pack are on top, you bring Ford on at 10 and move Farrell to 12 as England look to use the spaces and open up against a tiring defence.\n\nIt could be a masterstroke and it\u2019s a tried and tested formula for Jones.\n\nNow, if you want to consider a really risky selection in contrast, how about Michael Cheika bringing in 19-year-old wing/full-back Jordan Petaia at centre?\n\nEverybody talks highly of Petaia\u2019s potential but that really is a radical roll of the dice.\n\nEddie has made other big, but carefully considered calls. Mako Vunipola has been operating under a fitness cloud because of his long-term hamstring problems dating back to the European Cup final.\n\nSlade was part of the team that took Grand Slam champions Ireland apart back in February\n\nAgain, only England will know if Mako is truly match fit, but they have decided he is, so it is logical to start the big man with the in-form Joe Marler poised to come on when needed.\n\nCourtney Lawes in for George Kruis is another massive selection call, but both are great players, so there is no element of risk.\n\nI notice that Eddie is using the words \u2018brutal\u2019 and \u2018brutality\u2019 a lot in the build-up and there\u2019s the clue. It\u2019s going to be very physical, particularly in the opening exchanges and a couple of trademark Lawes tackles could put England firmly on the front foot. One of the characteristics of Lawes\u2019 tackling is that more than most big men, he is textbook and low \u2014 he goes for the legs or the midriff as he cuts down the opposition in their tracks.\n\nThat is key. He is one of the biggest hitters in the game and one of the fairest.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be fiery and volatile on Saturday and the only thing that can seriously derail England is if they get caught up in that, lose their heads and find themselves with a couple of players in the bin.\n\nAn early red card would be disastrous.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a very good team \u2014 if they can individually and collectively play under the pressure of the occasion, I can see nothing but an England win.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: If a coach is going to guide his side to World Cup glory, there will be big calls made along the way - and that's exactly what Eddie Jones has done by dropping George Ford.", "authors": ["Sir Clive Woodward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/21/19855302-0-image-a-8_1571345490981.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
