With alligators in it.", "language": "en", "text": "Venting his frustration with immigration earlier this year, President Trump suggested that U.S. soldiers patrolling the southern border shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down, put flesh-piercing spikes atop an electrified border wall and dig a moat.\n\nAnd fill the moat with snakes and alligators.\n\nThat\u2019s according to an excerpt from a new book, \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration,\u201d by New York Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, due out next week. The Times published the excerpt on Tuesday.\n\nTrump floated the man-eating moat idea in March \u2014 and advisers reportedly took it seriously enough to \u201cseek a cost estimate.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only extreme solution offered by Trump, according to the excerpt:\n\nHe wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That\u2019s not allowed either, they told him.\n\nTrump denied the report in a tweet in which he misspelled \u201cmoat.\u201d\n\nTrump is denying he ever proposed putting sharp spikes on the border wall...except he literally tweeted this image of the border wall with sharp spikes on top. https://t.co/FgTzR6KhQv \u2014 Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) October 2, 2019\n\nThe suggestions came after Trump ordered advisers to \u201cshut down the entire 2,000-mile border with Mexico \u2014 by noon the next day,\u201d the book said.\n\n\u201cThe president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,\u201d Thomas D. Homan, who had served as Trump\u2019s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the authors. \u201cThe president wanted it to be fixed quickly.\u201d\n\nTrump is known to lob his quick-fix ideas during briefings, without researching their practicality.\n\nIn August, Axios reported that Trump repeatedly suggested homeland and national security officials \u201cexplore using nuclear bombs to stop hurricanes from hitting the United States.\n\nDuring one hurricane briefing at the White House, Trump reportedly said, \u201cI got it. I got it. Why don\u2019t we nuke them? They start forming off the coast of Africa, as they\u2019re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts it. Why can\u2019t we do that?\u201d\n\nTrump denied that he ever suggested nuking hurricanes.\n\nThe story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2019\n\nThe cost of digging and fencing a trench along the 2,000-mile border, which includes long stretches of mountainous terrain, would likely be many billions of dollars, not counting the cost of the animals. The usefulness of alligators and snakes as deterrents to migrants is disputed. Authorities agree that accounts of crocodile-filled moats surrounding European castles in the Middle Ages are almost certainly apocryphal, although at least one fortress apparently was guarded by a trench inhabited by bears.\n\nAs absurd as it sounds, the gator-filled moat idea is not a novel one in modern U.S. politics. In 2011, President Barack Obama mocked Republicans who were pressing his administration for broader reforms at the border.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll want a higher fence,\u201d Obama said in a speech in El Paso, Texas. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll need a moat. Maybe they want alligators in the moat.\u201d\n\nHerman Cain, then a candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination, said it was a great idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have that moat,\u201d Cain told supporters. \u201cAnd I would put those alligators in that moat.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "According to \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration,\u201d due out next week, the president floated the idea of putting flesh-piercing spikes on top of an electrified border wall and building a trench filled with snakes or alligators.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_lZkSeQsCKXPVuNYHNXlGQ--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d0d1c5b0-e525-11e9-affe-eeadfde64d8f"}
