It has depreciated nearly 3.5% in a matter of a few sessions to hit an eight-month low. On the domestic front, policy flip flops pertaining to the issue of sovereign foreign currency bond and super-rich surcharge for FPIs induced uncertainty. It resulted in outflows from domestic equity markets. On the global front, escalation in the trade war between US and China dampened risk sentiment and outlook for global growth. This resulted in the unwinding of carrying trades and flight of capital from riskier EM assets to safe havens such as US treasuries and . The PBoC responded to fresh tariffs by letting the Yuan depreciate. broke the psychological 7 levels. The Rupee and other EM currencies have closely tracked the Yuan.\n\nThe cut in corporate tax rate by the government reignites the debate as to what is more effective \u201cdemand-side\u201d or \u201csupply-side\u201d economic policy.\n\nPutting it simply, proponents of demand-side argue that it\u2019s the aggregate demand that drives economic growth and therefore stimulating aggregate demand incentivizes companies to invest and increase capacity. Keynesian economics is classical demand-side economics.\n\nProponents of supply-side believe that cutting tax rates incentivizes companies to invest which in turn leads to job creation and which in turn spurs demand. Supply-side economists believe in the Laffer curve i.e. reducing tax rates up to a certain point increases tax revenues as overall growth increases. Supply-side economics is popularly summed up by the adage that \u201cThe tax cuts pay for themselves\u201d and by Say\u2019s law i.e. \u201cSupply Creates its Own Demand\u201d. US president Ronald Reagan extensively used supply-side economics, so much so that supply-side economics is often referred to as Reaganomics.\n\nIn India\u2019s context considering that the growth is stalling and that the monetary policy is on full throttle in attempting to stimulate the economy from the demand side, the corporate tax cut is an attempt to stimulate the economy from the supply side. The government would have weighed its options to revive growth i.e. embarking on a massive spending spree, cutting income taxes, cutting corporate taxes, cutting indirect taxes.\n\nIt ultimately chose to fulfill the industry\u2019s long-standing wish of lower corporate taxes. Though it is a welcome move as it aligns India\u2019s corporate tax rate with its peers and makes it competitive on the taxation front, it is just a first step towards minimizing the role of government and incentivizing the private sector to step up investments. Higher corporate taxes were not the only deterrent to private CAPEX.\n\nMuch more needs to be done on the governance front to improve the ease of doing business for the private sector. Hopefully, the government will initiate land and labor reforms to complement these tax cuts and remove structural impediments to investments. We need to see a major thrust on infrastructure and logistics. The share of capital expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure is too low at present and needs to be ramped up. We need to see the government exit inefficient public sector undertakings and therefore large-scale strategic disinvestment is the need of the hour.\n\nOne would, therefore, like to believe that India is on the right side of the Laffer curve and that these tax cuts would have the intended benefit in the long run if they were complemented by structural reforms. One would hope that it is not a quick fix to give a temporary fillip to investment sentiment but a part of a well thought out strategy to ensure that \u201cMinimum Government and Maximum Governance\u201d is not just on paper.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by IFA Global covering: XAU/USD, USD/CNY, Gold Futures.
