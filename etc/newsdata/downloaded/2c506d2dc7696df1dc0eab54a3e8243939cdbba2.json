But Maximilian\u2019s story could easily be called \u201cThe First Influencer.\u201d\n\nThis year marks the 500th anniversary of Maximilian\u2019s death in 1519, but the power-hungry monarch\u2019s story has piercing parallels to modern day leaders. Though he ascended into power through a strategic marriage to Duchess Mary of Burgundy, Maximilian solidified his control through relentless propaganda campaigns.\n\nAs the Renaissance loomed, the emperor cultivated a chivalrous, heroic image straight out of Camelot. His preferred power flex came in armor. Met curators, led by Pierre Terjanian, pulled together over 180 objects from around the world for this exhibit.\n\nThe first thing one sees upon entering the wing is a suit of armor made for one (poor) horse who had to carry it, and presumably a rider, into battle.\n\nThere are spiked gauntlets originally worn by Maximilian, which wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place onstage with Lady Gaga during her \u201cBorn This Way\u201d era. Visitors will also find an A-line skirt made out of armor, a breastplate with an extremely intimidating spike jutting out the heart, and a tiny child\u2019s suit made for Maximilian\u2019s son.\n\nTerjanian told The Daily Beast that most of the armor has not been weighed, but he wagered the heaviest is \u201cabout 80 pounds.\u201d The emperor owned so many weapons and suits of metal that he purchased an entire home just to fill it with his bounty.\n\n\u201cMaximilian wanted control over his image, and he wanted to be instantly recognizable,\u201d Terjanian said. \u201cHe\u2019s rarely portrayed as a modest man.\u201d\n\nMaximilian, who preferred to be portrayed in profile, oozes a commanding serenity in the portraits on display, including one from 1502 by Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis. The middle aged emperor looks downright steely, staring off purposefully. \u201cHe looks experienced, like an almost indestructible figure,\u201d Terjanian said.\n\nIf desired, one can draw comparisons between Maximilian\u2019s status obsession and Donald Trump\u2019s shameless promotions, of which there are too many to mention here. Like the president, Maximilian rose quickly through the ranks due to his status as an heir, and he worked hard to ensure that his children carried on the legacy he craved.\n\nHis sons, Philip I and Philibert II, played with tiny toy jousters, which have been preserved for five centuries and can be seen as early ancestors of army men figurines. It gets less cute when show notes describe his daughter Margaret of Austria as a \u201cpolitical instrument\u201d for Maximilian and his French equivalents.\n\nSimilarly, Bianca Maria Sforza, who in 1494 would enter into a pretty miserable, childless marriage with the emperor, is dubbed \u201cthe instrument of dynastic negotiations with positive outcomes\u201d between Maximilian and her uncle, the Italian prince Ludovico.\n\n\u201c He who makes no memory of himself during his lifetime will have none after his death, and will be forgotten with the tolling of the final knell. Therefore the money that I extend on perpetuating my memory will not be lost \u201d\n\nScholars often cite Maximilian as the first ruler to realize the potential of art as propaganda. One of the museum\u2019s walls contains his quote, \u201cHe who makes no memory of himself during his lifetime will have none after his death, and will be forgotten with the tolling of the final knell. Therefore the money that I extend on perpetuating my memory will not be lost.\u201d\n\nThe museum is organized chronologically, beginning not with Maximilian\u2019s early childhood or family background, but his first marriage to Mary, Duchess of Burgundy, which began his ascent into a storied royal lineage.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to wander the maze of rooms containing armored suits, stained glass windows, building panels, portraits, and letters from Philip to his constituents without paying much attention to his life story.\n\nHistory buffs can get caught up in the detailed timelines and dates listed on the Met\u2019s many wall panels. But anyone who just wants to see Game of Thrones costumes is welcome to ogle at chainmail through the plexiglass.\n\nThe people who entered the emperor\u2019s orbit\u2014wives, children, political connections\u2014are represented in imagery, but the gut of the exhibit is based on the artwork and military outfits Maximilian commissioned. For an exhibit based around one singular figure, it feels entirely devoid of personality.\n\nRather than craft his own identity, Maximilian\u2019s collection projected a display of power in the most generic sense. You will leave the exhibit wondering how anyone managed to carry 80 pounds of chainmail on their back, but you will not feel closer to the man who ordered it made.\n\nIt feels entirely devoid of personality for an exhibit based around one singular figure; rather than craft his own identity, Maximilian projects power in its most generic sense.\n\nSo out of all the war-hungry monarchs of European history, what makes this one worthy of precious Met real estate? The exhibit\u2019s title, \u201cThe Last Knight,\u201d refers to the almost mythic reputation Maximilian later earned, as his life straddled the end of the middle ages and beginning of the early modern era. On display are both Excalibur-like swords and realistic portraits painted in chiaroscuro style.\n\nDespite his financial struggles and political squabbles, the emperor kept commissioning new work, willing his spot into the history books. This exhibit exists because Maximilian ensured people would still talk about him, five hundred years later.\n\nA young man when the printing press was first invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440, Maximilian came of age alongside the radical invention, and utilized books as tools of communication, too. He commissioned illustrated novels with brightly-colored scenes depicting him as a hero.\n\nA surprising amount of these 500 year-old relics are on view behind glass cases, one with annotation from Maximilian. Bibliophiles, walk away from the Instagrammable horse armor and head straight to an intricately decorative prayer book which once belonged to the emperor\u2019s father-in-law.\n\nMax Hollein, director of The Met, also tried to make the ruler\u2019s story relevant to most pressing issues of today, saying at a preview that Maximilian's \u201cbattles over borders and beliefs affected many lives.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in 1509 the HRE mandated that all Jewish books be destroyed\u2014a sobering thought to remember when marveling at all of the collection\u2019s shiny gold things.", "description": "\u2018The Last Knight\u2019 showcases over 180 objects from the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, an early master of political propaganda\u2014and whose armor fashionably showed his ruthlessness.", "authors": ["Alaina Demopoulos", "Style Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570215023/191003-alaina-maximillian-tease_x5evyw", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
