but Parliament can\u2019t change the Prime Minister\u2019s mind, Parliament can\u2019t change the Government\u2019s policy or determination.\u201d\n\n(Image: PRU/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nNo10 hopes to stage its Meaningful Vote on Monday evening - but it can only take place if Commons Speaker John Bercow gives the green light.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell said a vote this evening would be \u201cpointless\u201d and a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d.\n\nThe Government will also introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill on Monday - the formal legislation which needs to pass through Parliament so Britain can quit the bloc.\n\nDowning Street hopes a vote on the Bill\u2019s crunch second reading can take place on Tuesday, with the result likely to be on a knife-edge.\n\nNo10 has braced MPs for marathon sittings in the Commons this week and a potential weekend session in the Lords next Saturday and Sunday to pass the Bill before the deadline.\n\nIt comes after MPs voted by a majority of 16 to back an amendment put forward by former Tory Cabinet Minister Sir Oliver Letwin to withhold approval of the latest deal agreed between Mr Johnson and Brussels \u201cunless and until implementing legislation is passed\u201d.\n\nSir Oliver\u2019s move prompted fury in Downing Street - and Mr Johnson stressed he was only sending the letter because he was being forced after his latest parliamentary defeat.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe PM got a senior diplomat to send Brussels an unsigned photocopy of the letter asking to delay withdrawal from the bloc, with a cover note stressing his detachment from the move.\n\nIn a second note to European Council President Donald Tusk, the PM said a Brexit extension would be \u201cdeeply corrosive\u201d.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News: \u201cHe may well be in contempt of Parliament or the courts themselves because he\u2019s clearly trying to undermine the first letter and not signing the letter.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s behaving a bit like a spoilt brat.\n\n\u201cParliament made a decision, he should abide by it and this idea that you send another letter contradicting the first - I think it flies in the face of what both Parliament and the courts have decided.\u201d\n\nEven Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage branded the move \u201cnot very prime ministerial\u201d.\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nCritics said it was the latest example of petulant, childish behaviour and entitlement by the Old Etonian PM.\n\nLast month (September) it emerged he had branded David Cameron a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in written notes.\n\nMr Johnson also called Jeremy Corbyn a \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d in Commons\u2019 exchanges last month(SEPT).\n\nShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of \u201cbeing childlike\u201d with his \u201csilly approach\u201d.\n\nHe told the BBC: \u201cThe law is very clear - he should have signed one letter in accordance with the law.\n\n\u201cIf we crash out because of what he has done with the letters, without a deal, he bears personal responsibility for that.\u201d\n\n(Image: Empics Entertainment)\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, who backs a second referendum, said: \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s behaviour is both childish and dangerous.\n\n\u201cRefusing to sign a letter he is required by law to send is something worthy of a 10-year-old, not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cIt only adds to the damage that Brexit has done to our country\u2019s international reputation.\u201d\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners could ask judges to rule on Monday if the stunt was in contempt of court.\n\nSNP MP Joanna Cherry said Mr Johnson previously pledged not to defy or frustrate the law, and it \u201clooks like he\u2019s breaking both promises\u201d.\n\nAn existing Brexit court case is due for its next hearing in the Inner House of Edinburgh\u2019s Court of Session later(MON).\n\nCampaigning QC Jo Maugham tweeted: \u201cThe question whether the PM and Advocate General for Scotland are in contempt of court is one for the Inner House.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBoris Johnson sent an unsigned request to the EU for a delay to Brexit - followed by a signed one arguing against it.\n\nThe PM sent three letters in all - an unsigned photocopy of the request as outlined by the Benn Act; an explanatory note from the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU; and a personal, signed, letter saying why he does not want a delay.\n\nIn his second letter, signed by Mr Johnson, he said he believes a delay would be a mistake.\n\nThe PM was required by law to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline after losing a Commons vote.\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that he had received the extension request and would consult EU leaders \u201con how to react\u201d.\n\nEarlier, Mr Johnson rang European leaders, including Mr Tusk, to insist that the letter \u201cis Parliament\u2019s letter, not my letter\u201d.\n\nOpposition MPs have warned the PM that if he tries to circumvent Parliament\u2019s instructions to seek a delay, then he may find himself in the law courts.\n\nThe second letter from Mr Johnson - signed off this time - makes clear he personally believes a delay would be damaging.\n\nIt says the government will press on with efforts to pass the revised Brexit deal agreed with EU leaders last week into law, and that he is confident of doing so by 31 October.\n\nA cover note from Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s representative in Brussels, explained the first letter complied with the law as agreed by Parliament.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nUnsigned letter\n\nDear Mr President,\n\nThe UK Parliament has passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019.\n\nIts provisions now require Her Majesty\u2019s Government to seek an extension of the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, currently due to expire at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 October 2019, until 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020.\n\nI am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty.\n\nThe United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nAmbassador's letter\n\nDear Secretary-General,\n\nAs the United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the European Union, I invite your attention to the following matter.\n\nAttached is a letter sent as required by the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019.\n\nIn terms of the next steps for parliamentary process, Her Majesty\u2019s Government will introduce the necessary legislation next week in order to proceed with ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nI would be grateful for your acknowledgement of receipt of this letter.\n\nSir Tim Barrow\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nPM\u2019s signed letter\n\nDear Donald,\n\nIt was good to see you again at the European Council this week where we agreed the historic new deal to permit the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on October 31.\n\nI am deeply grateful to you, President Juncker and to all my fellow European leaders for the statesmanship and statecraft which enabled us to achieve this historic milestone. I should also register my appreciation for Michel Barnier and his team for their imagination and diplomacy as we concluded the negotiations.\n\nWhen I spoke in Parliament this morning, I noted the corrosive impact of the long delay in delivering the mandate of the British people from the 2016 referendum. I made clear that, while I believe passionately that both the UK and the EU will benefit from our decision to withdraw and develop a new relationship, that relationship will be founded on our deep respect and affection for our shared culture, civilisation, values and interests.\n\nWe will remain the EU\u2019s closest partner and friend. The deal we approved at last week\u2019s European Council is a good deal for the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU.\n\nRegrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement. The UK Parliament Representative will therefore submit the request mandated by the EU (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 later today.\n\nIt is, of course, for the European Council to decide when to consider the request and whether to grant it. In view of the unique circumstances, while I regret causing my fellow leaders to devote more of their time and energy to a question I had hoped we had resolved last week, I recognise that you may need to convene a European Council.\n\nIf it would be helpful to you, I would of course be happy to attend the start of any A50 Council so that I could answer properly any question on the position of HM Government and progress in the ratification process at that time.\n\nMeanwhile, although I would have preferred a different result today, the Government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October.\n\nIndeed, many of those who voted against the Government today have indicated their support for the new deal and for ratifying it without delay. I know that I can count on your support and that of our fellow leaders to move the deal forward, and I very much hope therefore that on the EU side also, the process can be completed to allow the agreement to enter into force, as the European Council Conclusions mandated.\n\nWhile it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister, and made clear to Parliament again today, my view, and the Government\u2019s position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.\n\nWe must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent our peoples share. I am passionately committed to that endeavour.\n\nI am copying this letter to Presidents Juncker and Sassoli, and to members of the European Council.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBoris Johnson", "description": "Humiliated Boris Johnson is a \u201cspoilt brat\u201d who maybe in contempt of court for sending two letters to Brussels after his Brexit defeat, says Labour", "authors": ["Ben Glaze", "Oliver Milne", "Dan Bloom", "Image", "Pa", "Pru Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Peter Summers", "Empics Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661260.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brexit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
