The fragility of our transport systems.\u2019\n\nPhil said: \u2018We know that. If there\u2019s a power cut we know it\u2019s fragile. You don\u2019t need to prove that to us. What you\u2019ve done is you\u2019ve stopped ordinary people going to work. Some of them workers whose families will depend on an hourly rate of the money that they make. You\u2019ve surely shot yourself in the foot.\u2019\n\nSarah said that she \u2018could understand\u2019 the disruption caused and the impact it can have, and Phil attempted to ask another question.\n\nPhillip Schofield said Sarah was making the same point multiple times (Picture: ITV)\n\nSarah told him: \u2018Phillip would you like me to answer your question or would you like to talk over me?\u2019\n\nPhil replied: \u2018There\u2019s no reason to get like that. We\u2019ve got a lot to get in now and you\u2019ve actually made that point unless you want to make it multiple times.\u2019\n\nHe also addressed the fact that people then left the Tube station and got in cabs to get to work. Sarah argued that the point of the action was not to have \u2018a beneficial environmental impact\u2019 but \u2018to highlight the disruption that is going to happen to our very, very fragile systems\u2019.\n\nSarah Lunnon explained the action was to reveal the \u2018fragility of our transport systems\u2019 (Picture: ITV/REX)\n\nPresenter Holly Willoughby added that the fact there will be no further London Underground disruptions today could be seen as an admission that they had \u2018got it wrong\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah argued: \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got it wrong necessarily because today I\u2019m sitting in this studio and we\u2019ve been bumped three times from This Morning studios in the last 10 days. And it\u2019s taken us being this disruptive to get on your programme to talk about the emergency we are facing.\u2019\n\nPhil cut in: \u2018Is that why you do it?\u2019, and Sarah laughed before pressing on with her point.\n\nThis Morning airs weekdays from 10.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
