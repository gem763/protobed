If the guy was crazy enough, he could\u2019ve maybe hurt my children,\u201d he told WTKR.\n\nRyan showed reporters the broken doorframe on his patio door and said he thinks when it fell to the ground, that was the moment one of his daughters realized something was wrong.\n\n\u201cI think when he popped this off and it fell\u2026 it scared my daughter that was sitting on the couch,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan believes the suspects jumped on top of their blue recycling bin and climbed over the fence to enter the backyard.\n\n\u201cThere were a bunch of cop cars here already, the K-9 unit was here, police helicopter was flying overhead,\u201d Ryan said, adding that his was the only break-in he knew of in the area.\n\nHowever, Ryan\u2019s eldest daughter, Kelly, said their half-lab, half-pit rescue dog named Penelope scared the burglars away with her fierce bark.\n\n\u201cI was shocked. I really thought she would just lick the guy to death,\u201d Ryan said of the brave animal.\n\nSo far, police have found no fingerprints matching those that were discovered on the doorframe of the family\u2019s home.\n\nDespite the attempted break-in, Ryan said their family is doing alright and noted that he feels much better knowing that Penelope is around to keep them safe.\n\n\u201cUnbelievably surprising and rewarding to know that you have a dog that did that. It gives me a little more comfort when I\u2019m not home and my kids are home by themselves,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "A family dog is being hailed a hero after she chased two suspects away from her family's home in Virginia Beach, Virginia.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/police-car-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
