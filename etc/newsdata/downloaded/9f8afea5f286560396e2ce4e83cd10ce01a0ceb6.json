The Government and Parliament must now work together to ensure this is best deal for the UK small business community.\n\n12:06PM\n\nMoney markets don\u2019t think a rate cut is looking likely\n\nMoney markets don\u2019t think a rate cut is looking likely Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg\n\nWith a deal on the table, belief is ebbing that a no-deal exit could occur. That has reduced expectations that the Bank of England may soon have to cut interest rates.\n\nThreadneedle Street officials have doggedly held the bank rate in recent months, saying they would rather wait until the impact of Brexit is clear before they begin a process of monetary easing aimed at stimulating the economy.\n\nBloomberg reports:\n\nNow money markets see only a 60pc chance that the central bank will lower its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points by that time, according to MPC-dated Sonia swaps data from TP ICAP.\n\nJust two days ago, the market was pricing a full 25 basis-point decrease by November 2020 after policy maker Gertjan Vlieghe said continued Brexit uncertainty would probably require further monetary stimulus.\n\nLast month, the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee elected to hold rates at 0.75pc.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more here: Bank of England gloomier on growth but refuses to join Fed in cutting rates\n\n11:52AM\n\nPound back under $1.29 as doubts linger\n\nThe pound hit a 34-year low in early September More\n\nAfter soaring to a fresh five-month high against the dollar and the as news of the deal broke, the pound has weakened slightly.\n\nIt is currently sat just below $1.29, having broken that barrier for the first time since May earlier. Traders \u2013 like the rest of us \u2013 have two questions on their minds:\n\nCan this deal pass through Parliament?, and: If not, what happens next?.\n\nIt\u2019s a good moment to reflect on how far the currency has shifted: since sinking to a 34-year low of $1.17 at the start of September, the currency has mounted a steady comeback, with foreign exchange desks buoyed by the assumption that a no-deal exit is off the table.\n\nLook in the longer term though, and the pound\u2019s weakening through the age of Brexit is still apparent: last year, we saw peaks above $1.40, and it was about $1.50 for much of 2015 \u2013 numbers that feel pretty far away right now.\n\n11:20AM\n\nFive charts that shows how a Brexit deal will boost the economy\n\nEU and Union Jack flags Credit: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP More\n\nWhat happens now that a deal in on the table?\n\nWell, if it passes (that\u2019s a bit if), it could mean more than three years of market volatility, stunted growth and political paralysis could be finally coming to an end, my colleagues Tom Rees and Tim Wallace write:\n\nNow that a draft departure deal has been struck, the economy faces a renaissance, unleashing pent-up investment, sending sterling higher and giving growth a much-needed shot in the arm.\n\nThey\u2019ve put together five charts that show how the economy is set to be boosted if Boris Johnson can get his Brexit deal over the line.

They will hope that this means, definitively, that a no-deal exit on 31 October cannot happen. Our focus now switches to whether this deal can command the support of the UK Parliament, and what the detail of the deal means for our members. Their objectives are securing frictionless trade and regulatory alignment with the EU, our largest market. They also must have access to the workers our industry needs.\n\nOANDA\u2019s Craig Erlam said:\n\nAnyone hoping that the process will be straightforward now is kidding themselves. With Labour whipping for a second referendum on the deal and the Lib Dems unlikely to support anything, there is still a good chance we're heading for an extension and election, in order to get this over the line. Nothing in Brexit is ever simple. It's going to be a wild weekend which will make the market open next week all the more unpredictable. If the deal gets through Parliament, the pound could perform extremely well at the start of next week, despite having already rebounded more than 8pc from the lows a month ago.\n\n10:56AM\n\nMarkets are elated, but there is still everything to play for\n\nBoris Johnson departs from the rear of 10 Downing Street.

The DUP are standing by their statement from earlier, and Mr Johnson will still need to win over hard-liners within his own party, who have said they will withhold judgement until they see the final text of the deal.\n\nThe parliamentary maths is ugly for the PM \u2013 he has to face a Commons that repeatedly rejected Theresa May\u2019s deal (one that was arguably superior to the special Northern Ireland customs arrangements integral to Mr Johnson\u2019s offering), possibly without the DUP\u2019s support:\n\n10:45AM\n\n...but are the DUP behind the deal?\n\nA potentially massive sting in tale amid this news though \u2013 which has slighlty clipped the pound\u2019s wings (though it is still over $1.29):\n\nNot clear if DUP is actually on board or No 10 is trying to bounce them \u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) October 17, 2019\n\nLooks like Boris Johnson is calling the DUP's bluff.

Credit: Sean Gallup/Getty More\n\nFor today\u2019s Think Tank, economics correspondent Tom Rees has taken a look at research Swiss bank UBS, where analysts have imagined what the UK economy would look like if Remain had won all those years ago. He writes:\n\nThe bank's analysis is not an indictment of the opportunities or threats of Brexit, but shows the hefty economic cost of attempting to force the most contentious issue for generations through a Parliament where no single party - let alone a united one - commands a majority. They believe the \u201cuncertainty costs\u201d from the political quagmire since the referendum is equivalent to \u00a3525m every week or \u00a3990 per household every year. \"To repeat, this loss occurs even though Brexit has not happened yet,\" says UBS economist Arend Kapteyn. That uncertainty penalty comes from businesses reining in spending, consumers tightening their belts and foreign investors seeking calmer waters elsewhere.

Here\u2019s Reuters:\n\nBuilding materials distributor Grafton Group warned that its annual profit would be below market expectations because of weak demand in the UK and delays in new construction permits in the Netherlands. The news follows a similar warning from smaller peer SIG last week, hit by a weak economic outlook in the UK and Germany. The company said it expects full-year operating profit for continuing operations to be 4pc to 8pc below current consensus of about \u00a3193.5m. In the backdrop of a multitude of uncertainties in Britain surrounding Brexit and global growth, the company said volumes were affected by weak underlying demand as Britons deferred spending on home refurbishment.\n\n8:12AM\n\nHere\u2019s how Europe\u2019s biggest stock indices stand...\n\nCredit: Bloomberg TV More\n\n8:11AM\n\nReaction: \u2018Sterling remains one bad plot twist away from disaster\u2019\n\nThe pound has weakened this morning after the DUP\u2019s statement Credit: JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP More\n\nHere\u2019s some reaction to this morning\u2019s political and foreign exchange moves, from Monex Europe\u2019s Ranko Berich, who says the pound is in risky territory:\n\nThe latest pushback from the DUP has only slightly deflated sterling, which is currently trading marginally below the five month highs seen yesterday afternoon when hopes of a deal were at fever pitch. FX market participants are clearly discounting the risk of no deal heavily and in addition to sterling being higher, some of the extreme pricing spikes have receded from options markets, reflecting a lower cost of hedging sterling volatility. Combined with the positive but unsubstantiated noises coming from negotiations, this has been enough to drive sterling higher. For now, hopes of a deal are likely to keep the pound buoyant but as always, sterling remains one bad plot twist away from disaster. We may yet see further concessions from the DUP, who could require more regional investment or strengthening of their ability to veto whatever customs arrangements Johnson has struck with the EU. However, with very little time for Johnson to seek further material compromises from the EU or the DUP there is still a strong chance we will see the Benn act tested this Saturday.\n\n8:07AM\n\nFTSE 250 falls at open, FTSE 100 flat\n\nWith markets having been open for a few minutes now, the FTSE 250 is about 0.3pc down, while the FTSE 100 is basically flat.
