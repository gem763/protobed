Aniston even studied Lauer's final episode of the morning show and the first one without him for acting inspiration.\n\n\u201cI was so devastated,\u201d Aniston told Variety of hearing the allegations against Lauer. \u201cIt\u2019s such a strange thing; it felt oddly like my dad did something terrible. I trusted him and had been interviewed by him. He was there for so many moments in my life. And when \u2018Friends\u2019 was ending, it was Katie (Couric) and Matt interviewing us.\n\n\u201cDid he know? Did he not know?\u201d Aniston said, wondering if Lauer was aware filming the Nov. 28, 2017 episode that it would be his last.\n\n'This was not the Matt we knew': Katie Couric breaks silence on Matt Lauer firing\n\n\"It was fascinating to see,\" she said, before adding that Steve Carrel's character Mitch Kessler is \"not based on him at all. He\u2019s just sort of the archetype of all of the men that he\u2019s representing.\"\n\nAnother man that fits into that archetype: Harvey Weinstein, with whom Aniston worked on the 2005 thriller \"Derailed.\" She recalled having to spend time at the film's premiere with the producer, who is currently awaiting trial on multiple accusations of sexual assault.\n\n\"I remember I was sitting at the dinner table with (co-star Clive Owen) and our producers and a friend of mine was sitting with me,\" Aniston said. \"And he literally came to the table and said to my friend: 'Get up!' And I was like, 'Oh my gosh.' And so my friend got up and moved and Harvey sat down. It was just such a level of gross entitlement and piggish behavior.\"\n\nMeredith Vieira says Matt Lauer's 'Today' show ousting felt 'like a gut punch'\n\nAhead of the Oct. 15 release of journalist Ronan Farrow's book \"Catch and Kill,\" about investigating wealthy, powerful men attempting to silence victims of abuse (which Variety reports includes details about Lauer's behavior toward a former NBC employee), Lauer is slowly making his way back into the public eye.\n\nWhile he's mostly stayed quiet in the nearly two years since being fired from \"Today,\" the 61-year-old dad of three has popped up a few times on his 16-year-old daughter Romy's TikTok account.\n\nIn one clip, he lip-syncs a line from \"Avengers: Endgame\": \"I am inevitable,\" he mouths, before his daughter turned the camera on herself to mouth a line from Nicki Minaj's \"Barbie Tingz.\"\n\nIn another, his daughter dances to an explicit song with Lauer in the background. \"He got mad at me for this,\" she captioned the video.\n\nAl Roker says Matt Lauer is 'focused' on his kids, wishes Megyn Kelly 'all the best'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/09/jennifer-aniston-watched-matt-lauer-today-ahead-morning-show/3916780002/", "description": "To prepare for her new fictional show \"The Morning Show,\" Jennifer Aniston re-watched the \"Today\" show episodes before and after Matt Lauer was fired.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published A.M.
