It works just like an instant runoff. The candidate at the bottom \u2014 in this case, Sanders \u2014 would be eliminated. The race would be down to two. The Sanders votes would be reallocated based on each voter\u2019s second choice. The winner would be the candidate that the greatest number of people could agree on. No one would have cast a spoiler or wasted vote. And the party could head into the general election knowing that its standard-bearer had broad support.\n\nThe FairVote/YouGov poll tells us what would happen in that case: Warren tops Biden, 53.4% to 46.6%. (Follow this link and you can create runoffs of your own with all of the candidates.) Maybe everyone wouldn\u2019t leave the convention happy. But they would leave having been heard, and certain that the majority carried the day.\n\nPolls are always just a snapshot. But this one suggests that in a field of some two dozen candidates, Warren is the one that most Democrats agree on.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Daley", "Realclearpolitics.Com Articles"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
