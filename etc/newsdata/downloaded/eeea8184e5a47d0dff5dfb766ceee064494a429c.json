This is a sharply different world than what the military has known for nearly 30 years since the end of the Cold War. Military operations since then have been against enemies lacking air power, navies, armored forces, or artillery and who have had no capability to challenge the U.S. military\u2019s ability to deploy and employ at will.\n\nTo what extent has America\u2019s freedom to operate effectively unopposed, combined with our strategic victory in the Cold War that ended without a shot, blinded America to what \u201cgreat power competition\u201d implies for our military and for our country?\n\nIn a powerful new essay for The Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2020 Index of U.S. Military Strength, Dr. Tom Ehrhard explains how America\u2019s past victories have skewed its perception of the reality of strategic competition, and have left the American public overconfident and complacent when considering the needs for national defense. Ehrhard unsparingly diagnoses the \u201cpathologies\u201d and provides recommendations for treatment.\n\nJoin us for a unique opportunity to engage on this important subject, and to get a sneak peak at a section of the upcoming 2020 Index of U.S. Military Strength, to be released on October 30, 2019.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/2020_US_Military_Strength_EHRHARD_0.png?itok=EfTJNh4D", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
