Police also said Sunday\u2019s location was close to \u201chigh-risk buildings\u201d that could be subject to violence, including central government offices, the letter said.\n\nCo-vice convener Bonnie Leung told journalists that the group was appealing. Police said the result would be made known on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe ban is the second issued to CHRF by police since it began organizing mass rallies in early June. Their events have been largely peaceful, though smaller groups of protesters have broken off and engaged in clashes with police in the hours following them, while violence has also marred some of the now near-daily protests organized by demonstrators online.\n\n\u201cIn the past three months, most gatherings that were originally peaceful were easily hijacked by violent protesters and turned into large-scale clashes in no time,\u201d acting assistant district commander Kwok Chun-kit said at a regular police briefing. \u201cThe police has long respected the public\u2019s right to peaceful procession and freedom expression, but it also has social responsibility to maintain public security and safety.\u201d\n\nSome verbal and physical scuffles broke out during an afternoon sing-off between groups singing the Chinese national anthem and others who were pro-democracy and singing \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d which some demonstrators see as Hong Kong\u2019s anthem, at the centrally located IFC mall, according to footage broadcast on Cable TV.\n\nHong Kong on Aug. 31 saw one of its worst days of violence since the movement began, as thousands of people came out in defiance of a prior ban on a planned CHRF demonstration. People threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, setting fire to a huge road block in the city center. Police cautioned residents in some areas to stay inside as they used \u201cappropriate force\u201d to disperse the crowds.\n\nSmall pockets of demonstrators also set fires, vandalized train stations and erected barricades in the city center this past Sunday -- including setting fire to an entrance at Central station, in a glitzy business and shopping area -- after a peaceful march by tens of thousands of people to the U.S. consulate in a bid to appeal to President Donald Trump.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Natalie Lung in Hong Kong at flung6@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Karen Leigh, Colin Keatinge\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong police banned a planned Sunday march and gathering called by the organizer of some of the city\u2019s biggest protests, days after demonstrators set fire to a central subway station as the pro-democracy movement carries on into autumn.Police Commissioner Stephen Lo on Thursday cited", "authors": ["Natalie Lung"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uj7NZDMfGzIK6BEyOV3YzA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/dfb4cdf9b8a7a5687c81fb35719c302a", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
