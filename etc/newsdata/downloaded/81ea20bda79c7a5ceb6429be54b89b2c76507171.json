She recorded three double-doubles and shot a staggering 98.3% from the free throw line.\n\nDelle Donne won the same award in June and July, so with August she swept the category. Both Delle Donne and the Mystics will hope to win their first WNBA title as they begin the postseason later this month.\n\nDelle Donne wasn\u2019t the only Mystic to be honored Wednesday. Coach Mike Thibault was named WNBA Coach of the Month for August.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
