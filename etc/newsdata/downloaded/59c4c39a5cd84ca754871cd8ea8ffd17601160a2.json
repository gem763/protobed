We recognise that economic outlook will depend on the form of UK's EU withdrawal in the medium term,\" Barratt said.\n\nThe company said its balance sheet and cash position would help it adapt to any possible changes in the environment it operates in.\n\nWith about two weeks to go before the United Kingdom is due to leave the world's biggest trading bloc, it remains unclear on what terms it will leave or indeed whether it will leave at all.\n\nHomebuilders are considered to be among the most vulnerable to any hit to the economy, which is a possibility in case of a chaotic no-deal Brexit.
