He said nations routinely tell each other, \u201cIf you can help me with X, we\u2019ll help you achieve Y.\u201d\n\nIn this case, Pompeo said, the U.S. position was not linked to Trump\u2019s personal political agenda but to the U.S. national interest in making sure Ukraine was not corrupt before selling missile systems to Kyiv.\n\nPompeo, a close ally of Trump, is now also caught up in the impeachment inquiry being conducted by the U.S. Congress into whether the president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and potentially withheld aid to Ukraine in an effort to force the Kyiv government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nPompeo\u2019s remarks Saturday came during an event organized by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. embassy in Greece at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens.\n\nPompeo has battled with lawmakers in Washington who issued a subpoena to force him and the State Department to turn over documents related to the investigation, which is focused on the July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy for \u201ca favor\u201d and urged him to work with his personal lawyer to investigate the Bidens.\n\nThe secretary of state told a press conference earlier Saturday that his department had on Friday sent an initial written reply to the document request from Congress. Democratic aides said Friday that Pompeo had not complied with the subpoena but State Department officials had reached out to the three relevant committees about the issue.\n\nDuring the on-stage interview in Athens, organized as part of the two-day visit, Pompeo insisted Trump had done nothing wrong and reprimanded journalists for probing his role in the July 25 phone call, saying reporters should focus on \u201cthings that matter to people.\u201d\n\nPompeo told his interviewer, the Greek journalist Nektaria Stamouli, that he did not think the audience was interested in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think they want to know about the relationship with America and Greece,\" said Pompeo. \u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong. When the world doesn\u2019t focus on the things that are right, the things that matter,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cYou see that\u2019s not healthy. That doesn\u2019t help democracies flourish. It doesn't help grow economies.\u201d\n\nPompeo \u2014 who has acknowledged he was listening in on the call between Trump and Zelensky \u2014 said there was nothing untoward about it.\n\nHe said Trump \u201chas every right\u201d to have conversations as he sees fit.\n\n\u201cLook, I was on the phone call,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on almost every phone call with the president with every world leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know exactly what we were doing there. We were trying to create a situation where it wouldn\u2019t be a corrupt government,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that they didn\u2019t interfere in our election in 2016. We wanted to make sure that if we underwrote Javelin missile systems \u2014 something that the previous administration refused to do \u2014 we wanted to make sure that we were doing this with a government that was straight-up, and would use that money for the things that it said it would use that money for.\u201d\n\nHe said such conversations were a normal part of diplomacy, with nations pressing other nations in the hope of advancing their own interests. Such exchanges took place between the U.S. and Greece and between Washington and other allies, Pompeo said.\n\n\u201cThis is what we do. We work together in a political environment to achieve what the Greek people want ... And America tries to advance its interests around the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s totally appropriate. Right? Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Pompeo asked. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s totally right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNations do this,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cNations work together and they say, \u2018Boy, goodness gracious, if you can help me with X, we\u2019ll help you achieve Y.\u2019 This is what partnerships do. It\u2019s win-win, it\u2019s better for each of us.\u201d", "description": "Secretary of state says \u2018If you can help me with X, we\u2019ll help you achieve Y.\u2019", "authors": ["David M.
