(Image: Kristian Donaldson and Lee Loughridge, Comixology)\n\nWhat if, after a deadly cyberwar eradicated technology as we know it today, humanity attempted to rebuild our tech-obsessed society through biological means? That\u2019s the futurist premise of Comixology\u2019s latest original graphic novel \u2014 and we have a look inside.\n\nWritten by Mark Sable and with art from Kristian Donaldson, colours by Lee Loughridge, and letters from Thomas Mauer, The Dark is set in 2045, on a post-war Earth where a devastating war has essentially eradicated all technology.\n\nIt\u2019s actually inspired by a short story Sable wrote for his work as a futurist theorist for The Atlantic Council\u2019s Art of The Future program, which gets creatives like writers and film directors to help the U.S. Military and Intelligence agencies imagine the future of warfare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a writer and a futurist, and The Dark feels like the culmination of both careers,\u201d Sable said in a statement provided to Kotaku. \u201cMost of my excitement comes from the work artist Kristian Donaldson has done literally bringing our vision of post-cyberpunk future to three-dimensional life. I\u2019ve never seen comic art like this before!\u201d\n\nDonaldson\u2019s approach to The Dark\u2019s design work does indeed have a bit of a tech-y twist: instead of traditional freestyle drawing, digitally or otherwise, Donaldson\u2019s linework is actually built off of 3D models, from a catalogue he has curated for years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of shooting a film and having all your sets built out, and all your actors in costume \u2014 every building, every room, every chair, gun, car and helicopter has been sourced and built and put together to make \u2018shots\u2019 with a free camera in virtual space,\u201d Donaldson explained in a press release. \u201cThere have been other books using 3-D but none quite like this by a single artist. I assembled a stable of 3-D assets for over five years now before drawing a single page.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope this book finds an audience with everyone in the world,\u201d he added in a statement to Kotaku. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it in guided view. Thanks to Ivan Salazar!\u201d\n\nThe full cover for The Dark. (Image: Kristian Donaldson and Lee Loughridge, Comixology)\n\nAs well as collaborating with Donaldson, Loughridge and Mauer, Sable worked with consultant Mey Rude to help develop the book\u2019s main themes and lead characters: Master Sargeant Carver, a blinded soldier equipped with biotech eyes tasked with a dangerous secret mission but especially for Camille, a trans, biopunk fugitive on the run from Carver\u2019s masters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really wonderful working with Mark and Kristian on this book,\u201d Rude told Kotaku. \u201cCamille is a complicated and fun character who I think a lot of readers, especially trans readers will enjoy and relate to. Cyberpunk and themes of bio-engineering have always been favourites of queer and trans people and to see a trans woman starring in a story about that has been great! I loved working with Mark and Kristian on making sure Camille seems real and relatable but also has her own story to tell. That\u2019s what I love about her, she\u2019s got a lot going on that trans readers will love, but also this is her story, not a generic trans one.\u201d\n\nHaving Camille\u2019s identity as a trans woman was an important perspective Sable wanted to include in a story about transhumanism and the future at large. \u201cMy hope is that readers will not just appreciate our near-future world-building, but be drawn in by the characters as well.\n\nWhile The Dark deals with themes of transhumanism, at the heart it\u2019s a very human story,\u201d Sable added. \u201cMaster Sergeant Carver is a wounded cyber-warrior, forced to hunt fugitives in order to keep the bio-engineered implants the government gave him.\n\nCamille is that fugitive, a trans biopunk who appears to have stolen data from the NSA\u2019s biocomputer. There\u2019s plenty of action, but Carver and Camille\u2019s relationship is what drives this unique story. I\u2019m excited for the world to share their triumphs and tragedies with us.\u201d\n\nCheck out a preview of The Dark below, making its debut here exclusively on Kotaku.\n\nAn exclusive look inside the world of The Dark.
