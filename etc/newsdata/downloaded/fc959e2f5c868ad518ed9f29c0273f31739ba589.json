Entire communities were leveled, leaving thousands homeless and food and water scarce.\n\nThe official death toll stands at 44, but authorities have warned it will rise much higher.\n\nAt the Treasure Cay airstrip, many private plane owners refused to fly anyone without a valid U.S. passport over fear the pilots would be detained for questioning, slowing return flights. Hundreds of refugees were ordered off a Florida-bound ferry in Freeport on Sunday because they did not have visas.\n\nNormally, most Bahamians would need a visa to come to the USA. Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, urged federal officials Monday to waive visa requirements and grant temporary protection status to the refugees.\n\n\"Those who have lost their documents in the storm or cannot receive a response from an overwhelmed Bahamian government shouldn\u2019t have to endure another tragedy of not being able to get to safety,\" Rizzo said.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R- Fla., urged the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Monday to clarify the rules and asked President Donald Trump to ease visa requirements.\n\n\u201cAs hundreds of thousands of Bahamians seek refuge or start to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian, we cannot have the kind of confusion that occurred last night in Freeport,\u201d Scott said.\n\nViral video posted from the ferry Balearia in Freeport on Sunday included an announcement that \"all passengers who don't have a U.S. visa, please proceed to disembark\" the ship, headed for Port Everglades.\n\nPeople unload humanitarian aid Sept. 7 at the Treasure Cay Airport in the Bahamas after the passage of Hurricane Dorian. More\n\nThe incident took place one day after the cruise ship Grand Celebration, with 1,500 refugees aboard, arrived at the Port of Palm Beach in an evacuation mission that had been coordinated with the U.S. and Bahamian governments. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said all of those evacuees possessed \"valid travel documents\" and advised private vessel and aircraft operators to coordinate any evacuation missions with Bahamian authorities.\n\nWSVN-TV in Miami reported that hundreds of disappointed passengers left the Balearia when the announcement was made. They may not have needed to.\n\nStephen Silvestri, acting port director in Port Everglades, told the station that authorities in his port would have processed the evacuees without visas. He blamed a \"business decision\" by the ferry operators, suggesting they did not want the ship docked for hours while the refugees were processed one by one.\n\n\"We would have processed them, vetted them and worked within our laws and protocols and done what we had to do to facilitate them,\" Silvestri said.\n\nNot everyone wants to go to the USA. Many Haitian nationals living on Abaco Island refused to leave or wanted to fly only to Nassau \u2013 the Bahamian capital on New Providence Island \u2013 over fears they might be sent back to Haiti by the U.S. government.\n\nUSAID Administrator Mark Green met with Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis on Sunday after briefly touring Abaco, pledging the U.S. government\u2019s full support. The U.S. military assists with relief efforts led by USAID, which brought in 89 people and four search dogs to pick through the rubble and prepare for a long road to recovery.\n\n\"A team is already on the ground in the Bahamas and has started to help with search and recovery and shelter assessments on Abaco,\" Minnis said. \"Thank you for your support.\"", "description": "Viral video from the ferry Balearia in Freeport included an announcement that \"passengers who don't have a U.S. visa, please proceed to disembark.\"", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Trevor Hughes", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FDpFPy6YJ6avmgOWqhfQXQ--~B/aD0zODI0O3c9NTU0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/5a4dca18f297febdf60c9e1bd4a01073", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
