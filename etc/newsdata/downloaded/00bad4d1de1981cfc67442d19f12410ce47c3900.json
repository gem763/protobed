Investigations by multiple committees into other matters would still go forward, Pelosi said, according to the sources.\n\nA Pelosi aide added that it was too early to speculate on how narrow or wide the scope of articles of impeachment might be. \u201cNo final decisions have been made,\u201d the aide told Yahoo News.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrives to meet with her caucus on Wednesday.

Scott Applewhite/AP) More\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday morning, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer \u2014 the second most powerful Democrat in the House \u2014 said that Trump\u2019s request to have Ukrainian authorities investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden would be a \u201cgreat focus in the short term.\u201d\n\nHoyer called Trump\u2019s recent phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \u201cseminal event.\u201d During that phone call, Trump appears to ask Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden. His father, Joe Biden, is a frontrunner in the Democratic primary that will decide who will face Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nThere was ample chatter among Democrats that the Ukraine scandal has opened the door to a broader impeachment process that will pull in a host of other accusations.\n\n\u201cMore than half the caucus thought there was more than enough there before this became public,\u201d a House leadership staffer told Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cWe have the obstruction of justice detailed in [the] Mueller report,\u201d the staffer continued. \u201cWe have information on emoluments violations, but are still collecting evidence. This Ukraine whistleblower stuff will undoubtedly add to what is being considered,\u201d the staffer said, adding to this list potential campaign finance violations associated with Trump\u2019s paying of hush money to former mistresses.\n\nThe co-founder of the bipartisan Ukraine Caucus in the House, Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, has been following the matter of U.S. aid to Ukraine for some time.\n\n\u201cRight now my concern is the fact that Congress voted for national security assistance to Ukraine. It was delayed and now we see the president was asking a political favor. This is a violation of the Constitution,\u201d Kaptur told Yahoo News.\n\nBut she added that she also would like to see a second article of impeachment added beyond the Ukraine matter to include the issue of Trump\u2019s using his government power to enrich himself.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the emoluments clause of the Constitution has been repeatedly violated, and I would hope there would be a second title to whatever would be the official articles of impeachment,\u201d Kaptur said.\n\nShe pointed out that Zelensky himself mentioned in the transcript of the phone call with Trump the fact that he had stayed at a Trump-owned property in Manhattan. There has been voluminous documentation of foreign leaders staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., during their trips to lobby the administration for assistance of one kind or another in addition to repeated instances of U.S. military personnel staying at Trump properties abroad.", "description": "House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer called Trump\u2019s recent phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a \u201cseminal event.\u201d", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Alexander Nazaryan", "Brittany Shepherd"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yVBXL2THV9Jr_n.UC7tA_g--~B/aD0yNTIwO3c9Mzc4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/da1e8760-dfd6-11e9-ae7f-c650bf161a01", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
