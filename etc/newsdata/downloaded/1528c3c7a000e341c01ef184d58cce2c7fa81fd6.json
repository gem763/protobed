REUTERS/Grant Lee Neuenburg\n\nThe election in the Southern African nation could test a fragile peace deal signed two months ago between Frelimo and rival Renamo, a former civil war foe that has emerged as the main opposition party.\n\nMost of Mozambique\u2019s 13 million registered voters were born after Frelimo came to power in 1975, when the country won independence from Portuguese colonial rule.\n\nA corruption scandal over government borrowing has hit the economy and damaged President Filipe Nyusi\u2019s popularity, but the strength of some voters\u2019 loyalty to Frelimo is one factor that could help the party win the presidential, legislative and provincial poll.\n\nA low-level Islamist insurgency in the north, on the doorstep of billion-dollar gas projects being developed by oil majors including Exxon and Total, has also taken the shine off Nyusi\u2019s presidency and threatens security longer term. Polls will open at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and close at 18 p.m. (1600 GMT), with the law allowing 15 days for results to be announced \u2014 though they could come sooner.\n\nEven if Nyusi wins, as expected, Renamo wants to win local elections in its traditional strongholds, giving it control over provinces for the first time since the civil war ended in a truce in 1992.\n\nRenamo fought Frelimo for 16 years from 1977 to 1992 in a Cold War conflict that killed about one million people. It ended in a truce but sporadic violence has flared in the years since - including after Renamo challenged election results in 2014.\n\nUnder the peace deal signed in August this year, provincial governors will now be picked by the main party in each province, rather than the government in Maputo \u2014 an opportunity for Renamo to gain long-thwarted representation.\n\nBut factionalism in the party and the fading popularity of its leader Ossufo Momade could yet make winning the number of provinces it would like a tall order.\n\nShould it come back empty handed, that could jeopardise the peace deal. The run up to the vote has already been marked by sporadic violence, including the killing of an election observer, and attacks from a breakaway group of Renamo fighters at risk of worsening if the party\u2019s outcome disappoints. A crowd that welcomed Nyusi at his final campaign rally in Maputo on Saturday cheered when he promised peace would stay. \u201cWithout peace, can we build factories... Can we build roads?\u201d Nyusi asked, to cries of \u201cNo\u201d from supporters decked in his party\u2019s signature red.", "description": "Mozambicans head to the polls on Tuesday in an election widely expected to result in the ruling Frelimo party extending its decades-long rule over a nation that is set to become one of the world's leading gas exporters.", "authors": ["Emma Rumney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1440914755&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E01L", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
