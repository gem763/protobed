It\u2019s an amazing place, absolutely, so a monthly rent of \u00a32,230 doesn\u2019t seem too outlandish.\n\nBut then we went to Leicester and met George, the owner and director of The Secret Garden hair salon, and Ross, an accessories designer, who have an equally lovely two-bedroom flat in Leicester city centre. They pay \u00a3800 between them, so \u00a3400 each.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLondoners, let us weep together.\n\nTogether they pay \u00a3800 a month (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHey, George! How much do you both pay to live here?\n\nWe pay \u00a3800 for our apartment per month, so \u00a3400 each.\n\nBills are quite cheap as we have a lot of natural sunlight which heats up the apartment and we\u2019re also on the third floor so we get other apartments heat. So we put into the joint account around \u00a3250 a month between us to cover the cost of our bills.\n\nWhat do you get for what you pay?\n\nSo we have a large open plan living/kitchen/dining area with a balcony space that extends from that. We have two bedrooms but we converted one into a dressing room. We have our main bathroom and also an en suite off our master bedroom.\n\nBoth Ross and George are creative, so have made the flat their own (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nDo you have a good deal?\n\nYes! Because it\u2019s not a massive space, we can keep the bills down and we\u2019re also careful with our electric and gas making sure all switches are off when they need to be to save energy.\n\nWe know we could get somewhere cheaper but it wouldn\u2019t have the perks of where we\u2019re at now.\n\nHow did you end up in Leicester?\n\nGeorge: I have always lived in Leicester as I was born here, but not central, as with my parents I lived on the outskirts of Leicester. Being in the city is new for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoss: I am originally from Stoke On Trent and I moved to Leicester around four and half years ago to study my Fashion Design degree at De Montfort University. It was in my second year that I met George and we have been together since \u2013 that\u2019s why I have stayed in Leicester.\n\nHow did you find the flat?\n\nWe have lived here just over a year, which has totally flown by if we\u2019re honest.\n\nMy dad luckily owns the apartment we live in. When we were originally looking for an apartment, the previous tenants\u2019 contract ended which was perfect timing for us. We immediately snapped it up and here we are now.\n\nThere\u2019s not enough storage, but the couple make do (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAre you happy with the area?\n\nWe love living on Freemen\u2019s Meadow as we\u2019re central to the city, we\u2019re minutes away from the train station, we literally overlook the Leicester city football ground and we are so close to our business.\n\nAt the back of our estate there is also a lovely canal which is perfect for walks.\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nWe do and we don\u2019t\u2026 there\u2019s always room for more, right?\n\nI think we would love a third bedroom and more storage space as storage is very limited in the apartment. But we love the space we have and are so grateful to be living in such a lovely part of Leicester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s it like living together?\n\nIt\u2019s amazing! With all the work going on we actually don\u2019t see each other all that much, unfortunately, as we work different days and times. But there\u2019s nothing better than coming home to the person you love.\n\nGeorge is the owner and director of The Secret Garden hair salon (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nHow have you made the flat feel like home?\n\nWhen we moved in it was shocking, to say the least. The previous tenants really abused the apartment but us being creatives knew we could make it so much better.\n\nWe have a love for plants and greenery. This makes the home cosy and is definitely a focal point for guests.\n\nWe have filled the apartment with objects that we love and mean something to us, which is so important. And of course there\u2019s a constant flow of traditional British tea and biscuits in the Freemen\u2019s Meadow household!\n\nYou have a lot of plants. How do you keep them all alive?\n\nWe have to admit, not all tje plants are real\u2026 simply because a lot of areas in our apartment, for example the bathroom, don\u2019t have any natural light so we had to go fake.\n\nWe\u2019ve got the right balance of real and fake as we can tend to the ones that actually need water to stay alive. It is difficult keeping up with them we have to admit, but it\u2019s the responsibility of having a botanical home!\n\nThe pair share their amazing home interiors on Instagram, under the handle @freemensmeadows26 (Picture: SWNS)\n\nAre there any problems with the flat?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone at all\u2026 which is so lucky! Touch wood.\n\nDo you have plans to move again?\n\nAt the moment we love the apartment and we have really made it into something we truly are proud of. We also have a home Instagram account called @freemensmeadow26 where we document the apartment in all of its glory.\n\nWe think in the future we would definitely love something bigger, maybe even a renovation project? We love the idea of a barn conversion potentially so we shall see.\n\nHave you considered buying a place?\n\nNot at the moment, as we\u2019ve just opened up the business The Secret Garden so having a mortgage and doing that just isn\u2019t an option at the moment. We\u2019re happy to pay rent while saving for our future.\n\nVery responsible. Let\u2019s have a look around.\n\nSeriously, this is my dream living room. Give me a moment of pure envy. (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nSome plants are fake, some are real (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThere are a *lot* of plants in this flat. Try to keep count, if you wish (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFor anyone else confused, that\u2019s a mirror, not a window (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nA neon cactus, because a real cactus just isn\u2019t enough (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nPeep the balcony (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nThe perfect place for an evening drink (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd once you\u2019re done with drinks, you can stroll right through to the dining area (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nYes, that is a plant wall. Yes, I do want one (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nBehold the kitchen (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFancy knives, bros (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nRoss and George converted the second bedroom into a dressing room (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nRoss is an accessories designer (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nLook at this bedroom. Dreamy, right? (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nEven the fan is nice (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nEvery flat needs a reading nook (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nFinally, the bathroom (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe like the hanging plants and shall steal that idea (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nMore plants, more flowers (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nPlease note how the toilet roll has a folded edge. It\u2019s like being at a hotel. (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nOne toothbrush. Mysterious. (Picture: SWNS/Metro.co.uk)\n\nWhat I Rent is a weekly series that\u2019s out every Tuesday at 10am.
