Three counters from the Gatlinburg Convention and Visitors Bureau added up 4,325 scarecrows and announced the total Monday morning.\n\nThe number is enough to break the record, but Gatlinburg will have to wait six to eight weeks until they hear from Guinness to see if they hit all the marks, according to Chad Netherland, director of marketing and public relations for the bureau.\n\nThe World's Largest Display of Scarecrows record parameters include surpassing the number of 3,812 scarecrows, all of the scarecrows having human facial features and all of them being in the walkable area of downtown Gatlinburg, according to Cheryl Wilkins, director of events for the bureau.\n\nHow the Tennessee city prepared for the Guinness record\n\nGatlinburg ramped up its fall decorations a few years ago, according to Netherland, and officials realized last year they could attempt to break a world record with local scarecrows.\n\nNetherland said businesses and the community got involved in attempting to break the record this year. The Gatlinburg Convention and Visitors Bureau bought thousands of scarecrows for the downtown area, and business owners and residents also bought and made their own to contribute.\n\n\"It's good to see involvement from all the business communities\" he said. \"They all participated, and it looks beautiful.\"\n\nDecorating for the record attempt started around two weeks ago with most of the scarecrows going up in the last week.\n\nThe scarecrows and fall displays will stay up through the end of October, and then Gatlinburg will switch them out for holiday decorations, according to Netherland.\n\nGuinness World Record process\n\nScarecrows on display in front of Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, on Oct. 14, 2019.

The counters traveled with a videographer on a golf cart to count the scarecrows throughout the town.\n\nFor the world record submission to Guinness, they had to have multiple witnesses, touch and count every scarecrow and film the count continuously, according to Netherland.\n\n\"There's all kinds of official rules, and we have followed these to the T, so we are excited, but it is a Guinness record, and they hold their rules and they hold their standards at the highest level, so we are excited to see where we come in with this,\" said Netherland.\n\nThe bureau sent the video and affidavits to Guinness World Records on Monday and will wait for official word\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/15/guinness-world-records-gatlinburg-seeks-record-scarecrow-display/3989649002/", "description": "Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is attempting to break the record for the largest display of scarecrows.", "authors": ["Maggie Jones", "Published P.M.
