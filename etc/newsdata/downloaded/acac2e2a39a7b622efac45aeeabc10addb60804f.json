REUTERS/Jim Young\n\n(Reuters) - Discount brokerage company Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) said on Tuesday it is eliminating commissions for online trading of stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. or Canadian exchanges.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 8.5% in morning trading and weighed on rivals. TD Ameritrade (AMTD.O) shares slumped 22%, while E*Trade (ETFC.O) slid 17%.\n\nSchwab\u2019s decision marks an inflection point for online brokers, as newer, nimbler rivals attempt to gain market share by offering zero or low-equity commissions to customers.\n\n\u201cIt has seemed inevitable that commissions would head toward zero, so why wait? We have a business model that doesn\u2019t depend on commission revenue, a long-term orientation and a history of being willing to disrupt ourselves,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford said in a statement.\n\nThe move to remove commissions would translate into a reduction of roughly $90-$100 million of quarterly revenue, which is about 3-4% of Schwab\u2019s total revenue, Crawford added.\n\nSchwab will reduce the commission to zero from $4.95 per trade, starting Oct. 7, the company said.\n\n\u201cThis is our price. Not a promotion. No catches. Period. Price should never be a barrier to investing for anyone, whether an experienced investor or someone just starting on the investing path,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger.\n\nThe company, which provides brokerage and financial advisory services, reported an 8% year-on-year jump in second-quarter net income at $937 million.\n\nSchwab managed total client assets of $3.75 trillion, as of July end.", "description": "Discount brokerage company Charles Schwab Corp said on Tuesday it is eliminating commissions for online trading of stocks, ETFs and options listed on U.S. or Canadian exchanges.", "authors": ["C Nivedita", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435903677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902X0", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
