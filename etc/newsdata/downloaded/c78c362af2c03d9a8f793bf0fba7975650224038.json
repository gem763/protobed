I\u2019m grateful. I have much to live for. And I intend to keep on living it.\u201d\n\nBack in March of this year, People magazine reported the Australian star was in the midst of treating stage 4 breast cancer. She was first diagnosed in 1992 and then secretly overcame a bout in 2013. Her most recent diagnosis came in 2017.\n\n\u201c\u2018Why me?\u2019 has never been a part of it,\u201d said Newton-John. \u201cBut I never felt victimized. I never felt, \u2018Why not?\u2019 Maybe deep down I knew there was a reason or a purpose for it, or maybe I needed to create one to make it OK for myself. Because, again, it\u2019s a decision: \u2018How am I gonna deal with it?\u2019\u201d\n\nJOHN TRAVOLTA PRAISES \u2018GREASE\u2019 CO-STAR OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN AMID HER CANCER BATTLE: \u2018I\u2019M VERY PROUD OF HER\u2019\n\nDespite fighting cancer for the third time, Newton-John said she doesn\u2019t dwell on the details concerning her prognosis.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, if they give you a percentage \u2014 you know, \u2018These many women get this and they live this long,\u2019 you can create that and make it happen,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think I know what the statistics are. But I put them away: I\u2019m gonna live longer than that. I\u2019ve made that decision. And I don\u2019t buy into the statistics, \u2018cause I think they can make you really nervous.\u201d\n\nKing, 64, also asked Newton-John if she ever thought about death.\n\nSNOOP DOGG'S 10-DAY OLD GRANDSON DIES\n\n\u201cYou have to think about it,\u201d said Newton-John. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s part of life. And, of course, if you have a cancer diagnosis, your death is kind of there. Whereas most people, we don\u2019t have a clue when we\u2019re gonna die. And I could die tomorrow; a tree could fall on me. So, it\u2019s just that we have that knowledge that we could die. But I\u2019m not \u2014 I try not to think about it too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to meditate and be peaceful about it, and know that everyone I love is there, so there\u2019s something to look forward to,\u201d she added.\n\nOLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN REVEALS SHE'S BATTLING CANCER FOR THIRD TIME\n\nIn November, California-based Julien\u2019s Auctions will be putting numerous pieces from Newton-John\u2019s personal clothing collection up for bid, including the iconic leather jacket and skin-tight pants she wore at the finale of the hit 1978 film \u201cGrease.\u201d\n\nThe clothes, along with a costume her character wrote in \u201cXanadu\u201d and outfits she performed in while promoting her \u201cPhysical\u201d tour in 1982 (among several other pieces from her wardrobe), will hit the auction block during the Icons & Idols \u201ctwo-day music extravaganza\u201d on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2 at the Standard Oil Building in Los Angeles.\n\nA portion of the proceeds from the auction will benefit the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Centre near her hometown of Melbourne, Australia.\n\nOLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN RECALLS TRANSFORMING INTO \u2018BAD SANDY\u2019 IN \u2018GREASE,\u2019 GIVES FANS CANCER BATTLE UPDATE\n\nBack in August of this year, Newton-John told Fox News she has been optimistic about her cancer fight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing great,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cLast year in September I was bedbound. I was lucky enough to be in my own hospital in Melbourne. I spent my 70th birthday at my wellness center. It couldn\u2019t have been more wonderful. My nieces and nephews were there, my best friend was there. It was really quite beautiful. And I\u2019m so proud of the center so it\u2019s a great honor to raise funds for it.\u201d\n\nNewton-John recalled how she was in \u201cincredible pain\u201d before learning of her diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI thought it was sciatic for a very long time,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt got much, much worse and I just couldn\u2019t walk. I had a break, which I discovered through some X-rays. But pain. Pain really because it\u2019s in my bones. That\u2019s how I knew.\u201d\n\nOLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN DISMISSES REPORTS SHE'S NEAR DEATH FROM CANCER\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t call it remission \u2014 I just say I\u2019m living with it,\u201d continued Newton-John about her health status. \u201cI\u2019m living with it very well. To think that you could get rid of every single cell is not really reality at this point. But I\u2019m feeling great. Things are shrinking. I\u2019m taking a lot of herbs because my husband worked in the Amazon and he\u2019s incredibly knowledgeable.\n\n\u201cAnd I use cannabis extracts, which has helped me incredibly. They\u2019ve helped me ween off morphine, which I was using for my [cancer-induced pelvis fracture] because I was in a lot of pain. Cannabis will not kill you but these opiates will. I\u2019m an advocate of it, very much so.\u201d", "description": "Olivia Newton-John is vowing to stay strong during her third battle with breast cancer.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/05/31/694940094001_5454234659001_5454225916001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
