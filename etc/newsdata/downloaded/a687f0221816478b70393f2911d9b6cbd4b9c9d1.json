These are used to create positive, measurable changes in thoughts, behaviours and habits.\n\n\"In order to take part, our participants have to want to be hypnotised because hypnosis is a self-generated state, which means if someone doesn\u2019t want to be hypnotised, then it\u2019s highly unlikely they\u2019ll go into a hypnotic state.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nMarmite have launched this competition to encourage the nation to stop sleepwalking into the same breakfast choices every single morning and instead, incorporate savoury breakfast options into their repertoire.\n\nNutritionist, Jenna Hope, further states the case for considering a savoury start to the day.\n\nShe explained: \"Consuming high-sugar breakfasts stimulates a spike in blood sugar level which provides fast, short-lasting energy. Encouraging the consumption of lower sugar, more savoury breakfasts can help to prevent these constant spikes and crashes.\n\n\"Foods such as Marmite, which are fortified with B vitamins, are a great way to optimise micronutrient profiles. With the rise of the vegan movement it\u2019s more important than ever that foods are fortified with vitamin B12 which, otherwise is very difficult to get from vegan dietary sources.\"", "description": "If you're not a fan of the incredibly divisive toast topper then you might want to keep reading this", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Marmite"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20544778.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_1-PR-hero-image.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
