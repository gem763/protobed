CNN\n\nThe truck container found carrying 39 bodies in Essex was transported from Belgium to the UK on a ferry called the Clementine, CNN has ascertained.\n\nThe Clementine belongs to Cobelfret Ferries and regularly shuttles between Zeebrugge, Belgium, and Purfleet, UK, according to maritime timetables seen by CNN.\n\nThe Clementine\u2019s timetable matches the timetable provided by UK Police which states that it arrived at Purfleet shortly after midnight on October 23, 2019. No other ship traveled this route for several hours either side of this timeframe.\n\nCobelfret Ferries confirmed to CNN that one of their ferries transported the container but refused to detail which one. They separately confirmed that the Clementine was one of their ferries. They refused to comment on whether the Clementine carried the container from Zeebrugge to Purfleet.\n\nAt this stage the ferry company is not under investigation by authorities but questions have been raised as to how the container could travel through Zeebrugge Port and board a ferry, if it was potentially carrying 39 bodies.\n\nCobelfret Ferries parent company, C.RO Ports, released a statement on Thursday saying they were assisting \u201cUK, Belgium and other law enforcement authorities with their ongoing investigation.\u201d", "description": "Police launched a murder investigation after 39 people -- who were identified as Chinese nationals -- were found dead in a container at the back of a truck in Essex.
