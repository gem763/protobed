Putin harder to defend.\n\nSoon after the July 25 phone call in which he urged Mr. Zelensky to investigate his political rivals \u2014 the call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 Mr. Trump seemed confident that he would get a peace deal on Ukraine after all.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to make a deal with President Putin, and he will be invited to the White House,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the Ukrainian president.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has not pressed Russia and sided with Ukraine in the negotiations in the way Mr. Zelensky has urged. To the contrary, at a news conference in New York last month, Mr. Trump backed away from Mr. Zelensky and his troubles in the war, telling the Ukrainian leader, \u201cI really hope you and President Putin get together and can solve your problem.\u201d\n\nBy distancing himself from Mr. Zelensky in negotiations, Mr. Trump has made it harder for the Ukrainian government to defend the concessions it is making to end the war.\n\nTo revive settlement talks, Mr. Zelensky has already ordered his troops to pull back at some locations on the front line, a move that earned derision from his domestic critics, who called it a capitulation to Russia. Tens of thousands of people in Kiev, the capital, protested the decision this month in Independence Square, the site of the demonstrations that toppled Ukraine\u2019s pro-Kremlin president five years ago.\n\nHere in eastern Ukraine, the war is far from over. On a crystalline fall day, the contact line, as the front is know, opened onto a meadow of dry grass, stretching a few hundred yards to the opposing positions in a tree line, the oaks and maples in the brilliant autumn colors of orange and yellow.", "description": "As President Trump froze military aid to Ukraine and urged it to investigate his rivals, the country was struggling in a bare-bones fight against Russian-backed separatists.", "authors": ["Andrew E.
