That is \u201csignificantly more than most of the Democrat presidential candidates are able to raise in a whole quarter,\u201d Parscale noted in an op-ed.\n\nThe entities raised a combined $5 million in the 24 hours following Pelosi\u2019s announcement:\n\nVoters vote with their wallets\u2026 and we are winning! You can not FAKE NEWS THAT. https://t.co/Ze29Iu0XTh \u2014 Brad Parscale (@parscale) September 25, 2019\n\nWhile Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reported a beefy $25.3 million in the third quarter, Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised $24.6 million, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) reported $19.1 million, several candidates saw numbers relatively the same \u2013 or lower \u2013 than the Trump campaign and RNC\u2019s three-day spike:\n\nJoe Biden: $15.2 million\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): $11.6 million\n\nAndrew Yang (D): $10 million\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): $6 million\n\nMarianne Williamson (D): $3 million\n\nSen. Michael Bennet (D-CO): $2.1 million\n\n\u201cThe sudden flood of donations to President Trump\u2019s reelection effort provides undeniable evidence that this impeachment gambit represents a massive miscalculation,\u201d Parscale noted, arguing that the impeachment effort is \u201calready coming apart at the seams.\u201d\n\nParscale said Democrats are using the impeachment effort as a mass distraction, albeit one that is backfiring. He predicts it could pose an issue for vulnerable Democrats in swing districts and result in \u201cserious losses\u201d for Democrats, who desperately want to maintain a majority in the House.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nIf this week\u2019s GOP fundraising haul is any indication, Pelosi didn\u2019t just drive another nail into the coffin awaiting the Democrats\u2019 nominee next year, she may also be looking at serious losses in the swing House districts that handed her the speaker\u2019s gavel in 2018. The moderate Democrats in those seats are already being put on the spot by the impeachment push. Their Republican challengers are poised to hold them accountable back in their home districts, hoping to ensure that those freshman legislators find themselves out of office next year. The true toll of the Democrats\u2019 decision to proceed with this Ukraine farce, of course, is the damage it is already inflicting on our government institutions. The American people won\u2019t look kindly on their politicization of a process that exists as a last resort in a genuine crisis \u2014 which this clearly is not.\n\n\u201cWe know that this charade won\u2019t result in Donald Trump leaving office, but it may well result in many Democrats leaving theirs,\u201d Parscale concluded.\n\nThe Trump campaign and RNC broke records this week, announcing a staggering $125 million raised in the third quarter.", "description": "Brad Parscale said the Trump campaign and RNC raised more in 36 hours than several Democrat candidates reported in the entire third quarter.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-883267414-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
