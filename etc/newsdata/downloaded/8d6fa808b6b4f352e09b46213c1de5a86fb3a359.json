Dave Birkett and Carlos Monarrez, Detroit Free Press\n\nTom Brady definitely is. Joe Flacco most certainly is not. And if you believe Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur, Matthew Stafford is, too.\n\nLaFleur, speaking in a conference call with Detroit reporters Thursday, said he considers Stafford among the elite quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\n\u201cMatthew Stafford, I think he\u2019s an elite quarterback,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cHe\u2019s a natural thrower. He\u2019s extremely accurate and I\u2019ve always \u2013 I haven\u2019t really gone against him too many times on teams that I\u2019ve been on but we all watch the same tape and he is just, I\u2019ve always thought he is an elite quarterback.\u201d\n\nStafford is off to a fine start this season, but 11 years into his NFL career, he\u2019s rarely been called elite.\n\nThe Lions have had just four winning records in Stafford\u2019s 10 seasons as quarterback and have never won a playoff game, though Stafford is on the verge of becoming the fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach 40,000 yards passing.\n\nLions quarterback Matthew Stafford and Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers chat before the game Oct. 7, 2018, at Ford Field. (Photo: Tim Fuller USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLaFleur, a Michigan native who\u2019s in his first year as Packers coach, said he defines an elite quarterback as \u201csomebody that when he\u2019s on your team you\u2019re confident that you have a chance each and every week to go in and win the football game.\u201d\n\nAsked how many elite quarterbacks are in the NFL, LaFleur said, \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know, to be honest with you. I know he\u2019s one of them, though.\u201d\n\nStafford has drawn high praise in recent days from not just LaFleur but others around the league.\n\nFormer NFL quarterback Carson Palmer said in an interview on \"The Tiki and Tierney Show\" this week that Stafford is \u201cthe most talented quarterback that I\u2019ve ever seen and just doesn\u2019t get his just due,\u201d largely because he plays for the Lions.\n\n\"I think Matthew Stafford has more talent than most of the quarterbacks in the league not named Aaron Rodgers and (Patrick) Mahomes, but he plays for Detroit,\" Palmer said, via WXYT-FM (97.1). \"The quarterback situation is so circumstantial, it\u2019s so based on the organization. If you play for a good organization, you\u2019re going to have a very, very successful career. If you play for a bad organization, it\u2019s turnover and change and firing coaches and firing GM\u2019s.\n\n\"Matthew Stafford has played for Detroit for too long and nobody knows he\u2019s as good as he is because they don\u2019t play on Monday Night Football multiple times a year and they don\u2019t play a bunch on Sunday Night Football.\"\n\nDetroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford passes against the Kansas City Chiefs during the first half Sunday, Sept. 29, 2019 at Ford Field.

Dozier, Detroit Free Press)\n\nStafford will share the spotlight with Rodgers this week when the Lions (2-1-1) play the Green Bay Packers (4-1) on Monday night in a clash of the two best teams in the NFC North.\n\nThe Lions have won two straight and three of their last four games in Lambeau Field, though Rodgers was knocked out of last year\u2019s meeting with a concussion.\n\nLaFleur, whose comments about Stafford were in response to a general question about the Lions offense, said his quarterback, Rodgers, a two-time MVP, falls into that elite category, too \u2013 something most NFL fans would agree with.\n\n\"Yeah, I feel like our guy\u2019s pretty good,\" he said.\n\n\"There\u2019s not a throw he can\u2019t make. I mean, he is something special and I think just it\u2019s so cool to see how he attacks every day and just how competitive he is. He\u2019s just so in control at all times.\"\n\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.
