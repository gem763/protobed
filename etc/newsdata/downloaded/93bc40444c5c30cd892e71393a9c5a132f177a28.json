REUTERS/Zoubeir Souissi\n\nKais Saied, a conservative law professor, and Nabil Karoui, a media magnate held in detention since last month, have an apparently solid lead over a moderate Islamist candidate and seem set to advance to a runoff vote next month.\n\nEight years after Tunisians staged the first of the Arab Spring revolutions to overthrow autocratic rule, Sunday\u2019s vote represents a sharp rebuke of democratically elected governments that struggled to improve living standards or end graft.\n\n\u201cHe will fight corruption and establish a just state and continue the process of the revolution,\u201d said fishmonger and Saied voter Noureddine el-Arabi, proudly showing the inky forefinger that proved he had voted.\n\nKaroui has for years used his Nessma television station and the charity he founded after his son died to present himself as a champion of the poor and a scourge of government, while his critics describe him as an ambitious, unscrupulous, populist.\n\nHe denies all claims of wrongdoing against him, including old tax evasion and money laundering charges which kept him in jail on election day, calling them an undemocratic plot.\n\n\u201cWe hope that Karoui will keep his promises and keep helping us like he did in recent years (with his charity),\u201d said a woman at Tunis fishmarket, who did not want to be named.\n\nHis wealth and massive electoral organisation stand in sharp contrast to Saied, who spent so little on his campaign that Tunisians joke it cost no more than a coffee and packet of cigarettes.\n\nSaied, who speaks in public in formal Arabic as if in a faculty meeting, drives an old car and wants to remain in his humble house if elected rather than move into the luxurious presidential palace at Carthage.\n\nA social conservative who backs restoring the death penalty and rejects equal inheritance for men and women, Saied\u2019s main focus is decentralisation in a country where politicians in the capital have traditionally dominated.\n\nWith 39% of votes counted, Saied was on 19%, Karoui was in second place with 15% and the moderate Islamist Ennahda party candidate Abdelfattah Mourou was on 13%, the official figures showed, proportions that now appear to be holding.\n\nISLAMISTS, POPULISTS, ESTABLISHMENT\n\nIn a radio interview on Sunday, Saied described his lead as \u201clike a new revolution\u201d, a reference to Tunisia\u2019s 2011 uprising that brought in democracy and set off the Arab Spring revolts elsewhere.\n\nTunisia\u2019s prime minister, two former prime ministers, the defence minister and a former president were among the political heavyweights competing in a field of 26 candidates.\n\n\u201cWe received the message sent by the Tunisian people,\u201d Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said late on Sunday, conceding defeat.\n\nAn official in Ennahda, seen as Tunisia\u2019s main anti-establishment force before it joined successive recent governments, said it would now focus on the Oct. 6 election for parliament, which wields more power than the presidency.\n\nWith a low turnout of 45% - down from 63% in 2014 - the result underscored widespread frustration over the sluggish economy, high unemployment, poor public services and persistent corruption.\n\nKaroui, in a statement read by his wife after exit polls were published, said result was a message to a political elite that he accuses of using the judicial process to try to silence him.\n\nTunisia\u2019s electoral commission has said he can stay in the race so long as he has not been convicted, though no date is set for a final verdict.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A child peeks out under a campaign poster of detained presidential candidate and Tunisian media mogul Nabil Karoui after unofficial results of the Tunisian presidential election in Tunis, Tunisia, September 15, 2019. REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed\n\nCourts have ruled that he must stay in custody while facing the charges, despite complaints by election monitors that this prejudices his chances. His opponents have said his use of his unlicensed television station should itself disqualify him.\n\nLegal questions over whether he could take the oath of office while in detention, or whether presidential immunity would protect him, are unsettled. A constitutional court to address such issues has not yet been set up.\n\n\u201cYou punished those who tried to steal the votes by putting me in prison without trial, and who prevented me from speaking to people in the campaign,\u201d Karoui\u2019s Sunday night message said.", "description": "Tunisian voters appear to have up-ended their nation's politics in Sunday's presidential election, rejecting established leaders for two outsiders with 39% of votes counted.", "authors": ["Tarek Amara", "Angus Mcdowall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430391463&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0KN", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
