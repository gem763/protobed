Jeff Fortenberry\u2019s devotion to President Donald Trump \u2014 and the state\u2019s sinking support for the president \u2014 will help her flip a district that\u2019s elected a Republican to Congress since 1964.\n\nState Sen. Kate Bolz, a former social worker who grew up on a family farm southeast of Lincoln, is running to oust Fortenberry next year. Since Fortenberry won his seat in 2004, he has been reelected by comfortable margins in the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which encompasses Lincoln (home of the University of Nebraska), Bellevue, Offutt Air Force base and rural towns.\n\nBolz sees an opening in 2020, despite Fortenberry\u2019s past popularity and the Trump\u2019s triumph in the district in 2016 by 20 percentage points. She hopes to capitalize on the \u201cblue wave\u201d momentum of the 2018 election and her state\u2019s large share of independent voters to finally flip the seat.\n\n\u201cI think people are paying attention more now than ever, partly because of the national context,\u201d she said.\n\nBolz is one of thousands of Democratic women running for higher office across the country in 2020. While she\u2019s no first-time candidate, having won her legislative seat in 2012, she\u2019s part of the larger push to get more Democratic women elected next year.\n\nRep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) \"has done nothing to help Nebraska farmers hurt by the trade war,\u201d state Sen. Kate Bolz said. She hopes to oust him in the 2020 election. (Photo: GETTY/KATE BOLZ) More\n\nFortenberry is a staunch Trump defender, and Bolz told HuffPost she was inspired by his inaction against the president to run for the House seat. Even after Fortenberry\u2019s teenage daughter approached him in tears over Trump\u2019s degrading comments about women in 2016, the congressman stood by the president, and he has since spoken out against House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe most troubling things are less the actions that [Fortenberry] has taken \u2015 it\u2019s his inaction on issues of such great importance,\u201d Bolz said in discussing her decision to challenge him.\n\n\u201cBolz is going to be a strong candidate, but I\u2019m not sure that will be enough,\u201d said John Hibbing, a professor of politics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \u201cI do think it\u2019s a long shot.\u201d\n\nA surefire route to a Bolz win, Hibbing said, would be \u201ca complete collapse of the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAnd that potential collapse may be coming in the wake of the president\u2019s Ukraine controversy.\n\n\u201cThe key would be what Fortenberrry\u2019s position is on that, and if he goes down with the ship, which could be damaging to him,\u201d Hibbing said. \u201cIt would look bad, so I\u2019m not sure he would do that.\u201d\n\nBut thus far, he has.\n\nFortenberry \u2014 a Louisiana native who moved to the Cornhusker State after college and served on Lincoln City Council before being elected to Congress \u2015 has called the impeachment inquiry \u201cdrama.\u201d He said he \u201cfound no violation of campaign laws\u201d after reading the White House-issued summary of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that kicked into gear the push to oust Trump from office.\n\nWhen reached via email for comment about Bolz\u2019s campaign, Fortenberry said simply, \u201cBorrrrrrrrrring.\u201d", "description": "State Sen.
