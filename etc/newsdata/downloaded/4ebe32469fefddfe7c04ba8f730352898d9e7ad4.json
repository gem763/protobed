It was one of the many little opportunities that his long-term injury provided to do something different, but also served to keep him mentally focused. It instead led to something of an out-of-body experience.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time I\u2019ve ever watched a football match with football fans of my team, if that makes sense. I\u2019m always either at the stadium, or at home. I\u2019ve never been to a pub where there\u2019s a bunch of Liverpool fans or Arsenal fans or England fans and watched it with them, to see what it means to them.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I\u2019ve missed something big here! This is special.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat is something often forgotten with players who became top-level professionals in their mid-teens, as was the case with the 16-year-old Oxlade-Chamberlain. For him, it\u2019s not something he\u2019d forgotten, it was something he\u2019d never experienced, and a novel inversion of seeing how the other half lived.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I was almost idolising them as well. Just seeing them do that and what it was creating around me, I was like \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s Raheem Sterling, look at what he\u2019s done, do I really do that?\u201d It was an experience, and my friends were like \u2018Chambo, this is why it\u2019s so weird for us when we sit at home with you, and then people that we know, how they talk about you and what they think of you\u2019. It\u2019s like, we\u2019re not what you see on there, put it that way.\u201d\n\nDid it not occasionally lead to the urge to show how the other half think, and gently correct any criticisms?\n\n\u201cThere were a few times where a bit of abuse stuck out and I wanted to be like \u2018Relax, relax, calm down!\u2019 but no, that\u2019s what football\u2019s all about. There were probably a few times when I was with them. \u2018What you doing?!\u2019\n\n\u201cSeeing what it meant to people, people rushing in from work, their shirts on still, their ties, bringing their girlfriend who\u2019s rushed in from the City as well. I met a couple of doctors there, a couple of boys from the City, a couple of plumbers, [they] all came into Boxpark and it was just mayhem and meant so much to everyone. I\u2019d never seen that first hand, so it was really, really special and sort of a reminder of what it means to play for England and how special that is.\u201d\n\nIt adds an extra layer of meaning to Saturday\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria for Oxlade-Chamberlain, which is likely to be his first England cap since the March 2018 friendly draw with Italy, especially since Gareth Southgate has already confirmed he would have been a starter had it not been for his serious knee injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like something new again,\u201d he smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s been 16 months, and there are a lot of new players here. I\u2019ve got to get used to it again, how things work, the new lads. It\u2019s exciting, feels kind of like a new start.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly been a long road back since going down in the first leg of that Champions League semi-final win over Roma in April 2018. Oxlade-Chamberlain has spoken at length about that recovery, but admits now he didn\u2019t initially tell his Liverpool teammates the extent of the injury, because he didn\u2019t want to dampen the mood around the raucous run to their first Champions League final under Jurgen Klopp.\n\n\u201cA few of them knew the severity, they didn\u2019t know the timescale. They knew I had to go in for surgery, and generally that means nine months. I didn\u2019t want them to put it out to the public and to the fans that it was going to be at least a year at that point just because it would have been a story that wasn\u2019t really relevant at the time in terms of what we were trying to achieve. It was something that will affect the team months and months down the line if I am not going to be available. We don\u2019t need to talk about me. It was more about concentrating on what the boys were doing, and how special that was.\u201d\n\nThat run to Kiev felt like the start of the final stage of this Liverpool team\u2019s development, that transformed them into one of the best teams on the planet. It also led to one of the starkest moments for Oxlade-Chamberlain, at the Olympic Stadium in the Ukrainian capital itself.\n\n\u201cI was at a point where it hadn\u2019t sunk in at that point. The season was still going, everyone was still working towards a thing that was so special in the Champions League that I still felt a massive part of. I was still living on through them. That\u2019s the only thing that matters at that point, and if they win that, I win that, I feel like it was all worth it, and all good. So when the final whistle went there, that\u2019s when it really hit me, and I got a bit emotional on the pitch, that was really hard. Then they had me in at Melwood the next day for rehab! To crack on.\u201d\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain greatly praises how Liverpool and the fans treated him during his recovery, as well as Southgate.\n\nThe trip to watch that match against Belgium during the 2018 World Cup was just one of many little steps to keep a perspective things, to use the injury as a positive, as was increased work on business interests like buying into a tech company. Oxlade-Chamberlain also did a lot of hospital visits, most notably at Christmas to the Zoe\u2019s Place hospice, to which he then donated \u00a320,000.\n\n\u201cYou do get times when you do feel sorry for yourself, feeling \u2018I can\u2019t play, I\u2019m on my crutches\u2019 but there are people so much worse off and I kept reminding myself of those little things.\u201d\n\nPerspective was essential to this process in general, especially given how much it takes mentally to get your head around the prospect of being out for a year. Oxlade-Chamberlain divided it into steps and goals \u2013 walking without crutches, sprinting, kicking a ball \u2013 in much the same way he has done with his entire career.\n\nAn international match like this, so close to a tournament where he would finally be a key starter, is all the more cause for thought.\n\n\u201cI maybe got caught up at a certain age and probably over-achieved when I was 18. I\u2019m in a position now where I\u2019ve just turned 26 and in my mind I still want to go to those places and give myself the best chance to be as good as I can be. I remember I used to think: \u2018When I\u2019m 24 I want to be right at the peak of my career and it\u2019s alright because I\u2019ve still got two years before I\u2019m 24.\u2019 You categorise it into years because your career is only so long but then every year would go behind me. By 24 I wanted to have won the Champions League and be scoring 10-15 goals a season. I set myself all these goals all the time but sometimes things just don\u2019t go the way you want them to. You have injuries, inconsistency, and I have been inconsistent in the past for sure in my performance, sometimes it is opportunity and selection, the quality of players around you and who can get in above you. It is a very competitive industry and sometimes it doesn\u2019t always go the way you want it. But one thing I would say, and why I remain proud of myself, is that even when a lot of things haven\u2019t gone as I wanted them to I still make sure I come back with the same optimism to improve and to do more. I am happy with the way I come back from those things and keep positive and keep striving.\u201d\n\nStarting a Wembley-staged Euro 2020 final at the age of 26 wouldn\u2019t be bad, and is now the very realistic goal.\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain similarly knows what it would really mean.", "description": "It was, according to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, a \u201csurreal\u201d moment of realisation. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d he says.
