Tear gas was fired as some demonstrators and police clashed in the early hours.\n\nFires lit in the street in central Beirut were smouldering on Friday morning. Pavements were scattered with the glass of several smashed shop-fronts and billboards had been torn down.\n\nProtesters blocked roads in the north, the south and the Bekaa Valley, among other areas on Friday, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. Schools were closed on the instructions of the government.\n\n\u201cWe are one people united against the state. We want it to fall,\u201d a protester in the town of Jeita, 15 km (9 miles) said. \u201cRevolution, revolution!\u201d they chanted.\n\nIn Beirut, several hundred people marched near the government\u2019s Serail headquarters chanting \u201cthe people want the downfall of the regime\u201d.\n\nThis was the second wave of nationwide protests this month.\n\nIn a country fractured along sectarian lines, the unusually wide geographic reach of these protests has been seen as a sign of deepening anger with politicians who have jointly led Lebanon into crisis.\n\nThe government, which includes nearly all of Lebanon\u2019s main parties, is struggling to implement long-delayed reforms that are seen as more vital than ever to begin resolving the crisis.\n\nDemonstrators sit together during a protest over deteriorating economic situation, in the city of Jounieh, north of Beirut, Lebanon October 18, 2019.

Another daily, al-Akhbar, declared it \u201cthe WhatsApp revolution\u201d that had shaken Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri\u2019s unity government.\n\nTwo foreign workers choked to death from a fire that spread to a building near the protests in Beirut, the NNA said.\n\nELUSIVE REFORMS\n\nSeeking ways to boost revenues, a government minister on Thursday announced plans to raise a new fee of 20 cents per day for calls via voice over internet protocol (VoIP), used by applications including Facebook-owned (FB.O) WhatsApp.\n\nBut as the protests spread, Telecoms Minister Mohamed Choucair phoned into Lebanese broadcasters on Thursday evening to say the proposed levy had been revoked.\n\nShattered by war between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon has one of the world\u2019s highest debt burdens as a share of its economy. Economic growth has been hit by regional conflict and instability. Unemployment among those aged under 35 runs at 37%.\n\nThe kind of steps needed to fix the national finances have long proven elusive. Sectarian politicians, many of them civil war veterans, have long used state resources for their own political benefit and are reluctant to cede prerogatives.\n\nThe crisis has been compounded by a slowdown in capital flows to Lebanon, which has long depended on remittances from its diaspora to meet financing needs, including the state\u2019s deficit.\n\nThe financial crunch has added to the impetus for reform but the government\u2019s steps have yet to convince foreign donors who have offered billions in financial assistance conditional on changes.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe strains have emerged recently in the real economy where importers have been unable to secure dollars at the pegged exchange rate.\n\nThe cabinet is due to meet on Friday at the presidential palace in Baabda in what a minister has said would be the final session to discuss the 2020 state budget.", "description": "Protesters across Lebanon blocked roads with burning tyres on Friday and marched in Beirut for a second day in demonstrations targeting the government over an economic crisis.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442212924&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0KD", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
