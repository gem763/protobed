If I called you and told you my mum had died, you wouldn't be like, 'give me a death certificate'.\"\n\nRachel grieved the loss \"in her own way\" and eventually moved on.\n\nThen two years later, the whole story unravelled.\n\nWhile back in her home town with a friend, she stopped by a restaurant where she was stunned to discover her ex-boyfriend, very much alive and working there.\n\n\"I just went into shock,\" she recalls.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nBut before she could confront him about it all, Rachel was asked to leave the restaurant.\n\nUnsure of the best course of action, she decided to talk to the police.\n\nHowever they weren't able to help as they said it was \"her word against his\".\n\nLater that same night, her ex's mother got in contact once again, this time to complain that Rachel had caused a scene at the restaurant and gotten her son fired.\n\nThe whole saga left the poor woman reeling and to this day there's still so much she doesn't understand about it all.\n\nHer biggest wish is that she could have had a chance to sit down with him properly and talk it through.\n\n\"I would have had questions,\" she adds. \"One or two.\"", "description": "A woman has shared the bizarre tale of how her ex-boyfriend faked his own death", "authors": ["Courtney Pochin", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Science Photo Libra", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743541.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_GettyImages-871450928.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
