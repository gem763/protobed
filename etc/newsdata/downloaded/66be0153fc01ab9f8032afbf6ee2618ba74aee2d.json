There\u2019s another passage in the Bible that warns that God will not be mocked. And there\u2019s yet one other bit in the Bible that tells how God, when ignored, mocked and resisted, will ultimately turn those who do the ignoring, mocking and resisting over to the sinful desires of their hearts \u2014 will ultimately toss figurative hands in the air like He doesn\u2019t care and say, OK then, have at it.\n\nThese aren\u2019t just old-tymey, old-fashioned, out-of-date and irrelevant biblical principles.\n\nThey\u2019re applicable to modern-day.\n\nThey\u2019re apt explanations for this just-released report, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: \u201cCombined cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia reached an all-time high in the United States in 2018.\u201d\n\nLet the secularists and atheists laugh.\n\nBut truly, this sorry state of cultural affairs is no laughing matter.\n\nThe CDC goes on to note that between 2017 and 2018, reported cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia all increased around the nation. Syphilis cases grew by 14% to more than 35,000; gonorrhea, by 5% to more than 1,300; and chlamydia, by 3% to more than 1.7 million.\n\n\u201cCombined,\u201d said Elizabeth Torrone, a CDC epidemiologist cited by CNN, \u201cthey total 2.4 million infections that were diagnosed and reported just in the last year alone.\u201d\n\nWhile the spikes in syphilis and gonorrhea cases represented the highest numbers reported for those STDs since 1991, the jump in chlamydia was a U.S. historical record \u2014 \u201cthe most ever reported to CDC,\u201d the report stated.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? Why the surge in sexually transmitted diseases?\n\nThe CDC finds these factors are contributory: drug use, poverty, decreased condom use, budget cuts to STD programs at the state and local levels, stigma \u2014 that is, the embarrassment that comes from seeking treatment \u2014 and, interestingly enough, \u201cunstable housing, which can reduce access to STD prevention and care.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and those of the left would no doubt agree with that list \u2014 particularly the part that argues in favor of more funding. Particularly when that funding argument can be tied back to President Donald Trump and his administration\u2019s rule changes for Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn August, for instance, the Concord Monitor reported on New Hampshire\u2019s 17% increase in chlamydia, 103% hike in syphilis and 352% jump in gonorrhea \u2014 all over a five-year period \u2014 by writing: \u201c[Health] providers say the absence of a budget this summer is hurting their ability to combat [the STDs]. A decision by the Trump administration to add new restrictions to federal funding for health care clinics that provide abortions \u2026 has taken a bit out of other health services.\u201d\n\nSorry, but the spike in STDs can\u2019t be blamed on Trump.\n\nNeither can it blamed on a supply shortage of condoms.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t make people have sex. Neither do condoms. This is how the secular mind works, though.\n\nOne ridiculous Democrat serving as Florida state representative, Anna Eskamani, who previously served as a Planned Parenthood regional director, is actually sounding the word on Orlando\u2019s upcoming LGBT \u201cCome Out With Pride\u201d event by distributing free condoms that are emblazoned with her photographed face. She explained her endeavor to Orlando Weekly as a means of breaking the \u201cstigma around sexuality and health,\u201d while taking to Twitter to joke, above a photograph of her product, \u201cI mean, who doesn\u2019t want a free condom with my face on it?\u201d\n\nShe epitomizes the problem with this nation and sex \u2014 that it\u2019s all fun and games.\n\nUntil people contract diseases.\n\nUntil innocent babies born to diseased mothers needlessly die.\n\nNot saying the CDC doesn\u2019t have a point about poverty contributing to a rise in sexually transmitted diseases. Not saying Democrats don\u2019t have a point about a need for funding to combat STDs with education and medical treatments.\n\nBut here\u2019s the real truth, the elephant in the room truth, the one nobody wants to talk about because it would seem intolerant, or judgmental, or too out-of-touch and rigid for a modern, free and easy world: Sex isn\u2019t a need \u2014 not like eating and breathing, anyway. So those who choose to have sex should either do so for the purposes sex was intended by God, else face the consequences. And hey now, guess what, drumroll please, consequences for sinful sex include STDs.\n\nRead the Bible. See for yourself. Galatians 6. Romans 1. A little Proverbs 30 thrown in for good measure. And more.\n\nThe surge in STDs shows the need for this nation to return to the Bible.\n\nIt\u2019s not a popular message for a growing secular world. But it is the one message that could actually and ultimately cure the country\u2019s entire STD problem. For good.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
