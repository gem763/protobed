These groups\u2019 loyalty may differ from country to country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Philippines: The country emerged as a key hot spot in the fight against the Islamic State, after extremists aligned with the group launched a battle for the city of Marawi in 2017. For months, the Philippine military tried to gain back ground, with material help from the United States and other countries. More than 1,000 people were killed \u2014 a figure that includes militants, soldiers and civilians, the military said.\n\nBut amid stalling progress in rebuilding the area, Islamic State-linked groups in the country \u2014 which has seen an influx of fighters from other parts of the world \u2014 are feared to be on the advance again. Earlier this year, Islamic State outlets asserted responsibility for the bombing of a Philippine cathedral.\n\nSouth Asia: There have also been persistent concerns over Islamic State-linked militants in India and its vicinity, in part fueled by the group\u2019s propaganda. In April, the Islamic State asserted responsibility for the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, which killed more than 250 people. In May, an Islamic State propaganda outlet claimed the group had established a \u201cprovince\u201d in India and was behind a recent attack on Indian troops in Kashmir.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut in both cases, analysts raised serious doubts about the group\u2019s capabilities to plot attacks of the scale of the Eastern Sunday bombings or to claim territory in the region in the same way as it had done in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSo far, the Islamic State\u2019s presence in India has been fairly limited, including in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which has been plagued by a decades-long militancy.\n\n\u201cThere are some boys over there who jump up every so often and wave [an Islamic State] flag,\u201d Ajai Sahni, a terrorism expert and executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi, told my colleagues earlier this year. \u201cThat\u2019s just an effort to get attention.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe only official Islamic State affiliate in South Asia is in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-Khorasan, with eastern Afghanistan as its stronghold. For more than five years, its militants have at times competed with and at times cooperated with the Taliban.\n\nAD\n\nIts fighters have launched deadly attacks, mainly against Afghan Shiites. In August, the group asserted responsibility for a suicide bombing at a Kabul wedding that killed more than 60 people. Analysts also worry that ISIS-Khorasan\u2019s reach extends into Pakistan.\n\nSomalia: The Islamic State emerged in Somalia after some militants broke away from al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked group, starting in 2015. Its presence has persisted, despite its rivalry with al-Shabab and despite pressure from the Somali government. More recently, Islamic State efforts to radicalize youths in neighboring Ethiopia have raised concerns.\n\nAD\n\nMali, Nigeria and other parts of West Africa: Security analysts worry that Islamic State-linked groups, along with militants linked to al-Qaeda, may be attempting a novel approach to gain a greater foothold in West Africa. Their new strategy? After deliberately provoking feuds among different ethnic groups, the militants systematically offer to \u201cprotect victims of the conflict they\u2019re stoking,\u201d my colleague Danielle Paquette wrote this month.\n\nThe footprint of Islamic State-linked groups in Nigeria continues to be so big that it is considered a major security threat in the region.\n\nLibya: Meanwhile, farther to the north, Islamic State-linked militants have wreaked havoc in Libya.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe country\u2019s political instability, the \u201crampant availability of weaponry\u201d there since the 2011 revolt and \u201clocal grievances\u201d were among the factors that have contributed to the Islamic State\u2019s presence in the country, terrorism researcher Inga Kristina Trauthig wrote in a paper for the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, or Europol, earlier this year.\n\nIslamic State militants\u2019 presence in the country has become a particular concern for Western security agencies because of \u201cLibya\u2019s status as a key transit country for migration to Europe,\u201d Trauthig wrote. As a result, the group may be able to \u201cinfiltrate the migrant pathways into Europe and exploit this illegal entry point in order to enable radicalised individuals to perpetrate attacks in Europe on its behalf or engage in other subversive activities, such as distribution of propaganda or collection of funds,\u201d she concluded.\n\nYemen: Whereas the Islamic State has been in retreat in Syria and Iraq, it continues to have a presence in war-torn Yemen. Recent strikes appear to have diminished the foothold of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the region, but both groups continue to exploit the country\u2019s chaos.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSympathizers worldwide: The group\u2019s propaganda continues to attract recruits in the West and can still spur former fighters who have returned to their countries of origin into action.\n\nIt remains unclear how many former Islamic State fighters escaped Kurdish prisons in northern Syria after President Trump recently announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region.\n\nBut European nations fear the escaped fighters \u2014 many originally from Western countries \u2014 could eventually return to Europe, where courts have often struggled to convict them.\n\nAs one of the Western countries hit hardest by Islamic State attacks, France stepped up security in the aftermath of Baghdadi\u2019s death, amid concerns about retaliatory attacks. French authorities, much like their counterparts elsewhere in the world, do not expect the group to go away just because the man who was its public face has been extinguished.\n\nRead more\n\nAD", "description": "Outside of Syria and Iraq, cells affiliated with or linked to the Islamic State have persisted in South Asia, Africa and other parts of the Middle East.", "authors": ["Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/slEIIJJ-z0-MBJoXdwtZxGbvjB8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/35WTC3HZOYI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
