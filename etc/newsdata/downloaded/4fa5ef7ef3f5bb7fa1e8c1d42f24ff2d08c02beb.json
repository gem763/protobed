And in any case, Gibbs \u2015 who has 560 acres of farmland in Shelby County \u2015 said he was done with Trump even if there was a deal:\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what he comes up with now. He could come up with this $50 billion, he could walk across my pond and not get wet, and I\u2019m still not going to vote for him because, you know, at the end of the day my name is Chris Gibbs, it\u2019s not Judas, and I\u2019m not going to sell my political moorings for 30 pieces of silver. So no \u2015 I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\nGibbs made a video for The New York Times last year pleading with Trump to end the trade war.\n\n\u201cI can draw a direct line from when the president started this tariff rhetoric in the price of my soybeans,\u201d Gibbs said at the time, adding that those prices plunged 20 percent.\n\n\u201cI have to tell you, Mr. President,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hurts.\u201d\n\nSee his full discussion on CNBC below:\n\nLove HuffPost?
