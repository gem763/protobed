Speaking at the 2019 GLAAD Gala San Francisco on Saturday, however, Levy recalled how his early experiences coming to terms with his sexuality fueled his interest in using his creativity to impact Hollywood for the better.\n\n\u201cStanding up here, it\u2019s hard not to think back to a very specific time in my life when I was still in the closet,\u201d said Levy, who accepted GLAAD\u2019s Davidson/Valentini Award for his LGBTQ advocacy work. \u201cI was in high school (in Tornto), I had a bad faux-hawk because the first \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 movie had just come out and I thought Tom Cruise was a real drink of water.\u201d (Watch the full speech in the video above.)\n\nNot living honestly and authentically, he added, came at a deeply personal cost.\n\n\u201cI legitimately thought that I would have to live with this secret \u2014 my being gay \u2014 for the rest of my life because I didn\u2019t have the security of seeing a lot of people like myself being celebrated in popular culture,\u201d he said.\n\nLevy \u2015 the son of actor Eugene Levy and screenwriter Deborah Divine Levy \u2015 came to rely on his family\u2019s \u201cfierce and unconditional\u201d love for support before coming out at 18. Others, he said, have not been so fortunate.\n\n\u201cHad I not had the love to give me a sense of security, I don\u2019t know if I would have found my way out of the closet, let alone create the opportunity for myself to tell stories on television that have effected some kind of positive change in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSupport, encouragement and love: three relatively simple acts of kindness that can change the course of a person\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nA desire to pay it forward, he said, was the impetus that led to the creation of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d in which he stars as David, a fashion-forward, pansexual man engaged to a gay man, Patrick (Noah Reid). And though \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d will be coming to a close after its sixth season airs next year, Levy pledged to continue incorporating LGBTQ-inclusive narratives in his future projects.\n\n\u201cI promise to continue to do my part in celebrating this radiant community in all the work that I do, big and small,\u201d the 36-year-old said.\n\nLevy\u2019s profile in Hollywood has risen exponentially since \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d became available for streaming on Netflix in 2017, two years after its debut on the little-known U.S. cable network Pop TV.\n\nEarlier this month, he signed a three-year deal to develop and produce new projects with Disney\u2019s ABC Studios.", "description": "Levy recalled how his coming out struggles spurred his Hollywood career in an emotional GLAAD speech.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9250a82100008207fe5055.jpeg?cache=g0dvn9akta&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
