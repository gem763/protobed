Pence officiated at his remarriage.\n\n\"I do think it's a legitimate point to be made,\" said Rusthoven, an Indianapolis lawyer who worked in the Reagan administration. \"This is the kind of thing that, as the vice president's own video clips from the campaign show, Republicans were outspoken about during the Clinton years.\"\n\nPence's top aide dismissed the group, saying the only constituency for the \"Never Trump\" Republicans is the liberal media.\n\n\"Without free promotion by anti-Trump press, no one would even know they still existed,\" chief of staff Marc Short said in a statement.\n\nWhat are we going to do, Mike? Trump's victory posed problems for Pence and his wife, new book says\n\nRepublicans for the Rule of Law bills itself as a \"group of life-long Republicans dedicated to defending the institutions of our republic and upholding the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe group started as an effort to push back on the Trump administration\u2019s claim that special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation was a witch hunt. They\u2019ve also urged Republican senators to act on proposed election security bills, among other issues.\n\nThe new ad highlights examples of foreign governments frequenting Trump properties. It includes snippets from the 2016 campaign showing Pence saying it would be a conflict of interest for Clinton to accept foreign and corporate donations to her foundation if she were president.\n\nBut \u201cwhen it comes to President Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest,\u201d the ad said, \u201call Mike Pence has to say is, `Who cares?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat line is excerpted from a Fox News interview Pence did soon after the 2016 election. Pence was asked why Trump\u2019s businesses would not pose a conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cWell, I can tell you, in a recent interview after the election, the president-elect summed up his view of his interest in his business life in two words. He said, `Who cares,\u2019\u201d Pence responded. \u201cDonald Trump is completely focused on the people's business. And I promise you, and I can assure the public that they\u2019ll have the proper separation from their business enterprise.\u201d\n\nTrump declared after the election that he was turning control of his businesses over to his sons. But he did not divest.\n\nTrump faces lawsuits over his ownership of a hotel that caters to foreign guests.\n\nCongressional Democrats have also been investigating possible conflicts of interest, including asking the administration for detailed costs of Pence's recent two-night stay at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel in Ireland this month.\n\nStay at Trump resort questioned: House Democrats investigating Vice President Mike Pence's stay at Trump resort in Ireland\n\nChris Truax, a spokesman for Republicans for the Rule of Law, said the ad goes after Pence instead of Trump because \"it's pretty clear that President Trump isn't going to listen.\"\n\n\"Vice President Pence might listen,\" Truax said. \"He was very vocal, and he was right, when he complained about Hillary Clinton soliciting donations for her foundation.\"\n\nThe group is spending $20,000 to air the ad on MSNBC and social media.\n\nRepublican attorney Peter Rusthoven speaks at an Indiana House Judiciary Committee hearing in 2014.
