Harvests 13,000 lbs of Dried Bio-mass from Oregon Hemp Farm", "language": "en", "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE -- PRIMO NUTRACEUTICALS INC. (CSE: PRMO) (OTC: BUGVF) (FSE: 8BV) (DEU: 8BV) (MUN: 8BV) (STU: 8BV) (\"Primo\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that further to the Company news release dated October 1, 2019 the Company has completed a harvest totaling 13,000 lbs of dried bio-mass of hemp from the Oregon hemp farm. The dried bio-mass hemp is currently being stored at a local drying facility located near Eugene, Oregon. The value for the crop in its current state is estimated to be worth $200,000 - $300,000 USD. This will be added to the 28 kilo grams of crude oil currently in inventor from last year\u2019s harvest.\n\n\n\nThe completion of the 2019 harvest season is a major milestone for the company and for the hemp farm in Oregon, as this is the first year hemp has been federally legal since the Farm Bill was passed. This year in Oregon alone there are nearly 63,000 acres registered growing hemp compared to the 11,500 acres growing hemp registered in 2018. This is a significant increase in the amount of hemp being grown, which solidifies the Primo strategy of providing drying facilities to the ever growing hemp market in Oregon. Primo plans to have its first drying facility built and in operation by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n\n\n\nPresident, Andy Jagpal Comments:\n\n\u201cI am very proud and excited with the amount of dried hemp that was harvested as it surpassed our expectations by a few thousand pounds. During a time in the cannabis market where companies have spent tens of millions of dollars building out facilities and cultivation infrastructure and have little to show for it, we have two harvests under our belt and product in inventory ready for sale. Together with this year\u2019s harvest and last year\u2019s inventory we estimate our inventory alone to be worth between $400,000 and $500,000 USD.\u201d\n\nVP Sales & Distribution, Andy Dhaliwal Comments:\n\n\u201cThe on-hand inventory and quality of the hemp as starting material is a major advantage in the current marketplace. While the revenue opportunities from the harvest are extremely promising, the hemp processing infrastructure supports the expansion of our in-house product lines, and increases our white-label offering to the USA market as well. Both of which are tremendous assets for the company.\u201d\n\nAbout Primo Nutraceuticals, Inc.\n\nPrimo Nutraceuticals Inc.
