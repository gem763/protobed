Shit was everywhere, just take a look on the TV.\n\nWhat they were always saying\u2014fifty thousand Elvis fans can\u2019t be wrong? News claimed over thirty thousand of those fans showed up, just to wait in line, see his body laid out at the Memphis Funeral Home. Rumor was that a few of the Beatles had even flown in all the way from England. Burt Reynolds and Ann-Margret, too. President Carter had to call in the National Guard, for Chrissakes.\n\nRaymond \u201cBubba\u201d Green wondered who was supposed to clean up all that shit. Taxpayer money, or cons handed Graceland details as Community Service.\n\nTo Bubba, there was only one thing that Dead Elvis meant: money.\n\nThe way the man from Cincinnati told it, it sounded like the King of Rock and Roll was worth more dead than alive\u2014or at the very least, his body seemed to pay by the pound.\n\nBubba Green, who at 25 had been expelled or suspended from every school he\u2019d ever attended throughout Tennessee, had grown accustomed to a life in and out of county lock-up, usually for selling drugs or for using them. By August 1977, he had grown more than accustomed to living for heroin, the same drug that had killed his Rhonda less than a year ago.\n\nThey\u2019d met right after Bubba\u2019s stint in Angola, that Louisiana state penitentiary named for the plantation and cotton fields that once occupied the land. Never married but thick as the thieves they were long enough for the State of Tennessee to label them as common-law. It had been Rhonda turned Bubba on to the harder drugs\u2014the chipping\u2014Bubba first figuring if she was going to be doing it, better she be supervised than unsupervised.\n\nWhile Bubba was finishing up another jail stint, Rhonda took off for Dallas. When he was sprung, Bubba got word she\u2019d been raped and killed in a roadside motel room, left to be found the next morning by housekeeping.\n\n\u201cWe was not as good for each other as we should have been,\u201d Bubba told people later, \u201cbut regardless, you know, I loved her.\u201d\n\nBack on the street by August of \u201977, Bubba hadn\u2019t much time for grieving. Let the world mourn Elvis, let him mourn Rhonda when he could. He had bonds to make, and Rhonda had taken what little money was left when she split for Dallas.\n\nBubba was thinking about just that\u2014the girl, the money, the debt\u2014when Blue Barron called him up Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cBubba, you looking to make some money?\u201d Blue was a local bondsman Bubba had come to know all too well. He knew Bubba was looking to make some money, knew he was always looking.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Blue. \u201cMeet me at the Luau.\u201d\n\nLike everyone in Memphis, Bubba Green knew the gaudy, Polynesian-themed exterior of the Dobbs House Luau on Poplar Avenue. Its sugary, fake island food was cheap and popular with the local college kids and the students from East High School across the street. He parked his motorcycle and, once inside, let his eyes adjust to the dim lighting of the large dining area.\n\nTiki torches flickered around the tourists lined up at the buffet. Mounted wood carvings shaped into sinister grins and framed stills of Elvis in Blue Hawaii were mounted along the walls. Blue Barron was seated at a family-sized wooden table under hanging plants and bamboo tufts. He was sitting next to another man. This one Bubba didn\u2019t recognize. White, looked big, husky, although he was sitting. Both men had their hands folded on the table top. They watched Bubba walk in and waited while he pulled his trucker cap low and sat down across from both. Neither spoke until Bubba was settled.\n\n\u201cAre you interested in making a million dollars?\u201d It was the big one beside Blue, the stranger. He said it more than he asked it.\n\nBubba didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d heard that number right, looked at Blue, who just nodded.\n\n\u201cI am mostly certainly interested in making a million dollars,\u201d Bubba said.\n\nThere was a pause before the large man leaned in. \u201cWell, what would you do for two million dollars?\u201d\n\nBubba could hear it now in his speech\u2014he was definitely a Yankee. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d Bubba said, \u201cmy mama ain\u2019t safe for two million dollars.\u201d\n\nThe man said he was from Cincinnati. Just about all he said, so Bubba thought of him as just that\u2014Mr. Cincinnati.\n\nBubba Green followed Mr. Cincinnati down Union Avenue to the Holiday Inn, the one in walking distance to Beale. There, he parked his bike on the side, saw the man lumber up the metal staircase leading up to the second story of the two-story hotel, then unlocking the door to one room and standing outside the threshold for Bubba to see him. \u201cGot any weapons on you?\u201d Mr. Cincinnati asked, raising Bubba\u2019s arms up in a frisk just inside the door.\n\n\u201cYessir, a knife,\u201d Bubba said, making eye contact and slowly handing over a butterfly knife from his right back pocket.\n\n\u201cWait here,\u201d the man said, pointing for Bubba to take a seat on the edge of the sparse room\u2019s twin-side bed. Bubba folded his hands on his lap and studied the green carpet and the ugly gold geometric shapes in the design, the white Venetian blinds, the writing table: an ashtray loaded with Mr. Cincinnati\u2019s cigarette butts and a small Holiday Inn stationery pad and matching pen. Crumpled balls of the stationery littered the desk.\n\nHe listened to the sounds of Mr. Cincinnati in the bathroom, not sure what was going on inside but hearing movement like the shower curtain being slid, followed by some exhausted grunting. The man emerged, each hand clutching an identical brown suitcase. He tossed both onto the bed behind Bubba\u2019s back. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said, flipping a case open.\n\n\u201c Bubba had already decided the money had to be counterfeit. All that cash in one place? Had to be fake. \u201d\n\nBubba stood beside him, on his toes to crane over the larger man\u2019s shoulder. He stepped aside for Bubba to see: maps and large, full-color photographs, mostly aerial views of Shelby County. It was easy for him to make out the shape of Memphis, the grid of its arteries punctuated by the muted tint of bayous and the blue wall of the Mississippi River to the west. There were more papers stacked underneath, and Bubba caught on to the bold type at the bottom of one enlarged, color map. Forest Hill Cemetery. The name was familiar, Bubba remembered it from the news.\n\nMr. Cincinnati pulled out tighter diagrams of the cemetery property, these with hand-drawn lines linking A and B points. White tape lines met at a specific mausoleum in the center.\n\nThe man began to sift through the other contents, handing Bubba papers in bunches, explaining as he went along. There were copies of receipts for a casket weighing 948 pounds; a nine-pound brass lock made special in Oklahoma City; the dimensions of a large, plexiglass bubble. \u201cTake a look through these,\u201d he said. Bubba leafed through the stack and the man bent to open the other case. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said and lifted the lid.\n\nBubba\u2019s eyes nearly teared up. He was looking down at stacks of paper-belted hundred-dollar bills, each belt marked with \u201c1,000\u201d in black, felt-tip pen.\n\nBefore Mr. Cincinnati uttered another word, Bubba had already decided the money had to be counterfeit. All that cash in one place? Had to be fake. If not, this meeting was some kind of sting, Blue setting him up for another skip of his, needing an easy fall-guy. Who did he know, or who had he borrowed from who could rope him into some RICO thing?\n\nBubba had served enough time, he decided he\u2019d never be anyone\u2019s fall-guy.\n\nBut he also considered the bills looked real enough to pass along on the street. Rent, smack, bonds, and a ticket out of Memphis.\n\nHe felt Mr. Cincinnati\u2019s eyes on him, watching him look down at the money. If all that money is real, Bubba now thought, this Yankee is carrying it around, he ought to be more afraid of more than just my little old knife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask for 10 million dollars in ransom for the body,\u201d the man said. He was cool, calm, and collected\u2014even the way he said the words like \u201cransom\u201d and \u201cthe body,\u201d like they was everyday words in a normal, everyday sentence.\n\nRight in that there briefcase was a million dollars in belted bills, Mr. Cincinnati explained. It, along with another briefcase just like it, he went on, was all Bubba\u2019s\u2014but only if he could execute a single task: smuggle the body of Elvis Aaron Presley out of its final resting place\u2014the little cemetery just off Elvis Presley Boulevard.\n\nForest Hills Cemetery, Lot #796A; about four and a half miles from Graceland.\n\nThe mausoleum constructed for Elvis Presley was a massive building, more than double the size of the single-family shack in Tupelo, Mississippi, that had been his childhood home. This was a monument\u2014airy rooms housing six vaults, a palace of many chambers. Elvis\u2019 was the one directly to the left, Corridor Z: 9 feet long and 27 inches high. All white, columns and tile. You walked in, all you heard was your own footsteps and breathing, the echoes of eternity billowing throughout a maze of granite and marble.\n\nOn August 18, the burial started with a long procession down the street bearing Elvis\u2019 name\u2014a white hearse leading 17 white limousines, all booked at a moment\u2019s notice by Elvis\u2019 daddy, Vernon Presley himself. Police had to carry away screaming fans attempting to charge his son\u2019s hearse on foot. The copper coffin, weighing nearly a thousand pounds, was carried by the six people who were the closest the performer had to friends: road manager Joe Esposito, members of Elvis\u2019 entourage, the self-proclaimed \u201cMemphis Mafia,\u201d and Dr. George Nichopoulous\u2014\u201cDr. Nick\u201d\u2014Elvis\u2019 longtime personal physician, known to get the King anything required for nearly twenty years of maladies: road fatigue, dehydration, high blood-pressure, and the twisted colon that brought on the fatal heart attack.\n\n\u201c Before the crypt\u2019s gates were locked, a cylinder with Elvis' name, birth, and death dates was placed in the casket, ensuring easy identification during the Rapture. \u201d\n\nA small service was held at the mausoleum for a select group of family and professional VIPs, those who had known Elvis Aaron Presley in real life. They, too, were enough in number to line up for hours. Vernon was the last out, kissing the coffin and promising his famous son that Daddy would be with him soon.\n\nVernon saw to it that Elvis was buried wearing a white suit and a blue shirt, and had personally brought his son\u2019s beloved TCB ring into the mausoleum to slide on his finger. Between the booking of the limos, the custom casket, and the all-important emblematic ring, Vernon had demonstrated that his son wasn\u2019t the only Presley who could take care of business in a flash. Nine-year-old Lisa Marie helped her grandfather place a metal bracelet on her father\u2019s lifeless wrist. Lastly, before the crypt\u2019s gates were locked, a cylinder with Elvis' name, birth, and death dates was placed in the casket, ensuring easy identification during the Rapture. Elvis hated waiting in lines.\n\nThe crowd long gone, five workmen then cut through the three-thousand floral bouquets strewn among the lawn and entered Elvis\u2019s tomb. They went in pushing a wheelbarrow full of sand and carrying a five-gallon bucket of water and cement, churning into a double slab of concrete to seal the crypt. They then covered it all over with a large marble sheet, Elvis\u2019 name and lifespan to be chiseled later.\n\nLike every other newscaster in Memphis, Russell Ruffin covered the death of Elvis Aaron Presley, just as he had covered every related update to come out of Graceland since word of the death first broke. That day, Russ and his crew had been two hundred miles outside Memphis, covering a routine legislative meeting that dispersed as soon as a civic employee entered the boardroom to announce Elvis had just been pronounced dead over at Memphis Baptist. Russ led the caravan back to WMC-TV Memphis\u2019 Midtown studios on Union Avenue.\n\nAfter moving down from Nashville in late 1975, the 36-year-old Ruffin learned quickly that working for the NBC Memphis station would mean covering just about anything having to do with the city\u2019s favorite son. Not that he was complaining; Russ had grown up an Elvis fan himself, seeing Jailhouse Rock in theaters as a kid and painting sideburns on the sides of his face, strutting them around school before puberty allowed the real thing to grow in.\n\nAround the newsroom, Russ was privy to all the Presley gossip that long predated the death. It had been rampant throughout Memphis pretty much Elvis\u2019 entire career, as he\u2019d bought Graceland only a year after signing with RCA in 1957. Superstardom in a year, and with it, one of those heavenly mansions Jesus mentioned.\n\nRuss was quickly told the one about Elvis presumably breaking up a real bar fight right here in town, telling a shocked drunkard, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you pick on someone your own size?\u201d just like in one of his own movies. He then followed up on sightings of the King flying over Graceland in a private plane, surveying his kingdom below and amused at the sight of the crowd, unaware he was watching from above. Russ had looked into rumors Elvis had nearly been arrested for driving a go-kart down Elvis Presley Boulevard, saved only from the indignation of handcuffs by flashing the badge given to him by Richard Nixon. Elvis always had it on him.\n\nAnd then there were all the Cadillacs. Russ covered each of those, too.\n\nRuss had arrived in Memphis just in time to cover the third of Elvis\u2019 widely-publicized stays in Memphis Baptist Hospital, always under the banner of road fatigue or exhaustion. The truth about the prescription drug addiction would only come out later during Dr. Nick\u2019s trial\u2014the scandalous affair finding Nick forever branded a pharmaceutical rubber-stamp for high profile patients like the late Presley and his darker contemporary, Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nIt was during that stay in Memphis Baptist that the King got the bug to bestow his riches upon select members of an adoring public. See, if Elvis saw you on TV and didn\u2019t like you, he\u2019d pull out the small revolver always in his right boot and blast a hole right through the screen projecting your moving image. But if he saw you and he liked you, liked your face, then Elvis would pick up the gold phone\u2014the one next to the couch\u2014and dial a few numbers, have a new car sent to your house. That July, he\u2019d bought a total of 13 Cadillacs from the local Madison dealership, then sent them out to random worthy citizens throughout Memphis. With love, Elvis Presley.\n\nOr so Russ had heard. He was still working as a general correspondent for the network, hadn\u2019t made weekend anchor just yet, the day Elvis called up the station room and asked for him by name.\n\nRuss snatched the phone from his station manager\u2019s hand, immediately recalling the one about Elvis buying some lucky Denver news anchor a brand new Eldorado\u2014his reward for airing a \u201chuman interest piece\u201d on him, making the performer sound more like Mother Teresa.\n\n\u201cMr. Ruffin,\u201d an unfamiliar voice spoke back to him. \u201cJoe Esposito here. Mr. Presley is next to me and he really enjoyed that piece you did\u2026 You did a great job demonstrating his generosity\u2026\u201d\n\nPresley had handed the receiver to his loyal road manager before Russ could get on the line. Insult to injury: the Cadillac wasn\u2019t for any WMC-TV anchor. No, Elvis wanted the address for a girl Russ had interviewed earlier that day, one going through hard enough times she deserved a new Eldorado.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have her address, now would you, Mr. Ruffin? Elvis sure would appreciate it.\u201d\n\nMight as well get a story out of it. Russ had grabbed a mic and a cameraman, rushed to Memphis Baptist anyway. They got as far as Elvis\u2019 private door, eye-to-eye with an off-duty cop and Esposito himself. He haggled for a few minutes of taping, promising a piece for that evening\u2019s broadcast: something about the outpouring of flowers, cards and, yes, teddy bears, all Elvis\u2019 fans had been sending.\n\nGood enough for Esposito, but Elvis was a little too tired at the moment to talk to the camera. Russ ended up reporting from beside the door, while over his shoulder, Elvis\u2019 bare feet dangled off the edge of the bed, out-of-focus.\n\nThat was a year ago. By August 1977, Russ had earned a second title as weekend anchor and was a recognizable face around Memphis. Recognizable enough for an FBI informant to obtain his home phone number, letting him know someone was planning to steal Elvis Presley\u2019s corpse later that week.\n\nThursday, August 25, 1977\n\nTwo days wasn\u2019t all that much time for Bubba to plan for such a large-scale body-snatch, but it looked like Mr. Cincinnati had done his homework, making it all that much easier. He had a few names to get the ball rolling and would use his own promised payment for deferred expenses\u2014including the team he would need. Giving it some thought, he had the makings of a skeleton crew before the day was out.\n\nHe knew a safe-cracker, one who owned a set of cutting torches that could get through the mausoleum\u2019s iron railing. If memory served, Mike also had his own acetylene torches and oxygen tanks, like those scuba divers go out in the islands. Over the phone, he had tipped Bubba to an appliance store downtown, said they didn\u2019t keep such a close watch on their loading docks early in the day. He could hotwire one of the appliance trucks\u2014would be ideal, pick up whatever the hell it was Bubba needed help lifting.\n\nHe promised Mike 75 grand but considered upping it to as much as an even hundred if all worked out and Bubba was feeling generous. He considered the fact they still needed two additional sets of hands to get the casket from the crypt and into the truck box. Two more workers meant further dipping into Mr. Cincinnati\u2019s briefcase. But Bubba had seen on the news that it took four pallbearers to carry Elvis\u2019 casket; scaling back to only four was pushing it, he knew, but no way around it. He\u2019d have to pay off three.\n\nThere was another old boy from the neighborhood, always needed cash for junk. Bruce Nelson was five years older than Bubba. They had scored together, for a while during the Rhonda years. They hadn\u2019t spoken since Bubba had come back to Memphis, but he called him up, offered him 40 grand right over the phone. Maybe 60, same conditions as Mike.\n\nCounting it out in his head, Bubba told himself he wasn\u2019t necessarily being greedy. If he was in line to score two million for putting everything together, no reason he was expected to give it all away. He considered the outstanding bonds, the ones Blue Barron knew this type of one-time score would cover, and then some.\n\nAfter that, Bubba thought, he would contact a few smugglers he knew from Angola. They\u2019d be heading to the Caribbean once they got out, he remembered, and remembered the offer was open to sail along. Get him far away from Memphis and its ghosts.\n\nFor that, Bubba needed every cent he could squeeze.\n\nBubba ended his Thursday night with a beer, knowing he had a well-equipped box man in place, and some needed extra muscle. All he needed now was a wheelman, the getaway driver to high-tail them out of the cemetery, allowing Mike to casually join the other truckers on the freeway, their thousand-pound cargo secure in the box.\n\nBruce suggested Bubba contact Ronnie Lee Adkins. Bubba recognized the name from high school. They had never been friends, Ronnie was a year behind.\n\nBruce vouched for him, handed his home number to Bubba.\n\nFriday, August 26, 1977\n\n\u201cWant to tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d\n\nRonnie Lee Adkins, behind the wheel of his beige Chrysler, Bruce Nelson in the passenger seat. Bubba Green sat alone in the back, watching the storefronts and street signs along Elvis Presley Boulevard through the window on his left. Ronnie looked up at the rear-view mirror, waiting for a response.\n\n\u201cJust drive and I\u2019ll tell you where to go,\u201d Bubba said, not looking up when he said it.\n\nRonnie Lee Adkins had been the first to show up at the chosen meeting point\u2014the parking lot of a laundromat on Union\u2014his Chrysler idling as Bubba and Bruce pulled up along either side on their bikes. The men got in silently, Bruce finally saying, \u201cHow\u2019re you, brother,\u201d once the doors were shut. From the backseat, Bubba studied the back of Ronnie Lee Adkins\u2019 head, watched his hands stay gripped on the wheel even while parked. He thought this was a good sign, a solid first impression. He didn\u2019t mention the fact that he recognized Ronnie from school.\n\n\u201c 'Bubba, I gotta ask you. We been circling Elvis Presley\u2019s cemetery for any particular reason?' \u201d\n\nBubba determined not to reveal to Bruce or Ronnie exactly where they were going just yet. Both had agreed to the job based on the money, tonight\u2019s mystery tour being part of the deal. He was playing close to the chest, and that\u2019s exactly why his plan\u2014cobbled together in less than 48 hours\u2014was going to work out just fine. He was playing it smart for once. Hell, he\u2019d only needed Mr. Cincinnati\u2019s map of the cemetery interior and the casket schematics. Other than that, Bubba knew the streets of Memphis good as anyone else.\n\nSo far, it looked like Ronnie Lee Adkins did too\u2014and he took directions just fine. Bubba told him to turn onto the expressway, then sat back and folded his hands in his lap. He watched the Memphis streets pass by, all lit up, as quiet as the city gets, then went over the steps again in his head.\n\nMike would be sitting tight in the appliance truck on Route 69\u2014Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway\u2014waiting in the shadow of the Kerr Avenue underpass just west of the cemetery\u2019s rear entrance. His industrial cutters and locksmith gear were stashed in the truck\u2019s cargo box, along with a mobile generator just in case the truck\u2019s battery couldn\u2019t supply enough juice to drill through the concrete.\n\nAs soon as Mike saw the Chrysler, he would park at Forest Hill\u2019s west entrance, while the other three went around to Elvis Presley Boulevard on the east side. They\u2019d hop the fence on either side of the property, then Mike would use his flashlight to help them all meet in the middle. According to the map, Elvis\u2019 crypt was in the center.\n\nOnly Mike was told the last part of Bubba\u2019s 48-hour plan. First thing tomorrow morning, he\u2019d call the man from Cincinnati through Blue Barron, have him meet in the parking lot of Poplar Plaza Shopping Center just after dawn.\n\nMr. Cincinnati, Bubba told Mike, would be bringing those briefcases\u2014both of them.\n\nRonnie took the car onto Elvis Presley Boulevard. Again he looked up into the rear-view mirror. \u201cWhere from here?\u201d he asked.\n\nEyes still out the window, Bubba mumbled to keep circling around Kerr Avenue and Hernando Road, keep a lookout for the appliance truck.\n\nHalf a dozen passes already the last half-hour. No Mike. No truck. More circles. An hour passed. Bubba tugged on the brim of his trucker cap. Where the fuck was he?\n\n\u201cYou got a way to call your boy, check in on him?\u201d Ronnie asked.\n\n\u201cNaw,\u201d Bubba said, giving a quick glance away from the passing streets. \u201cHe don\u2019t get that truck, we just try again tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRonnie looked over at Bruce for a response, got nothing. He turned south on Hernando, all three men in the car glancing to their right, checking for a big, white truck one more time. Again nothing, just the darkness of the overpass shadow.\n\n\u201cBubba, I gotta ask you,\u201d Ronnie said, one arm over the other on the wheel as he made the turn passed Forest Hill\u2019s iron gates. \u201cWe been circling Elvis Presley\u2019s cemetery for any particular reason?\u201d\n\nBefore he\u2019d been handed a seemingly never-ending stream of Elvis Presley assignments, Russ Ruffin\u2019s usual stories included community affairs and local politics. Both areas went hand-in-hand with the Memphis crime beat, ensuring not only the guards at Graceland knew Russ\u2019 face on-sight, but so did the cops and bailiffs at the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center, local District Court, and the Tennessee Court of Appeals.\n\nHe\u2019d always dealt well with law enforcement. Back in Nashville, Russ had covered the local police\u2019s acquisition of their first Kevlar vests. The broadcast got him an invitation to the Press Club\u2019s Gridiron show, an annual event for statewide news VIPs, all gathered together in a grand ballroom to rib each other, safely out of the public eye. Taking the stage, Russ demonstrated the bulletproof vest using a starter\u2019s pistol.\n\nWord spread about Russ\u2019 Press Club appearance, and he got coerced by a network cameraman to recreate the stunt out in the studio parking lot. The cameraman was itching to test out the station\u2019s new video camera unit and already had a gun in the trunk of his car. They loaded a blank, but the velocity of the blast\u2014all the finite debris hidden in the fresh Nashville air, instantly ignited and shot at the speed of sound\u2014sent Russ reeling, slamming him against a brick wall.\n\nThe clip found its way onto one of Dick Clark\u2019s blooper specials. So far, that was the extent of Russ\u2019 national exposure.\n\nHe moved to Memphis the following year, having taken enough bullets for one team. That November, he dodged a larger one. A few buddies linked through his NBC affiliate invited him to French Guyana, where they were covering California Congressman Leo Ryan\u2019s visit to the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project\u2014\u201cJonestown.\u201d\n\n\u201c 'Hey man, don\u2019t use my picture. I\u2019m undercover.' \u201d\n\nRuss knew it was a big story and packed his bags. He made it to the airport but missed his flight. None of his buddies returned.\n\nAfter that, covering news out of Graceland didn\u2019t seem so bad, or covering the Memphis crime beat. It was never boring, and there were benefits to all the sheriffs knowing who he was, he could be trusted. Russ ended up with a lot of tips that way, all the cops and robbers both recognizing his face.\n\nLike the first week of August, when Russ and a cameraman were on a routine assignment outside Shelby County Court.\n\nHe had his shirt-sleeves rolled up, the mic in his hand, watching the fresh arrests being escorted out of the courthouse. After all these months, Russ had started recognizing some of the faces. One in particular looked familiar\u2014a white twentysomething male, sporting a day\u2019s-old scruff and a dirty pair of jeans and tee shirt. Looked like a drop-out, his long hair falling down his face.\n\nThe kid stopped right in front of Russ, leaned in close to his ear. \u201cHey man,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t use my picture.\u201d He nodded to the cameraman. \u201cI\u2019m undercover.\u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t seen him since, but Russ never forgot a face. Or a voice.\n\nThe last Friday of August, Russ was home with his wife. Penny had dinner ready just as soon as he had walked in, and they were already clearing the plates when the kitchen phone rang. He wasn\u2019t expected back at the station until early the next afternoon and was looking forward to a quiet night at home.\n\n\u201cIs this Mr. Ruffin from the TV news?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was familiar, but Russ couldn\u2019t place it. \u201cI had to get your number from the station,\u201d the man said. \u201cI told them I had an Elvis story for you.\u201d\n\nAnother Elvis tip\u2014it never seemed to end.\n\n\u201cWell, sure,\u201d Russ said, looking over at Penny drying the dishes alone. \u201cHow may I help you, sir?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause on the line before the caller spoke again. \u201cWell, you helped me out a few weeks back and I thought I\u2019d help you out now, too\u2014you know, with a story.\u201d\n\nRuss craned over to the countertop and reached for a pen and small pad, the phone cord twisting around his body. \u201cAnd how is that? I helped you out?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were at Shelby Court a few weeks back,\u201d the man said. \u201cI asked you not to use my picture. I was undercover, working with Memphis PD\u2026\u201d\n\nThere it was, the drop-out with the hair. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d the man continued, \u201cmy name is Ronnie Lee Adkins. You were good to me, and I want to give you a scoop on something\u2014something going down at Forest Hills Cemetery tomorrow night.\u201d\n\nSaturday, August 27, 1977\n\nIf this Adkins fellow was telling the truth, Russ considered, that gang of misfits better be strong\u2014and be bringing plenty of gear for the heavy lifting.\n\nHe had said as much to Penny, placing the phone back in the cradle and reading her his notes from the strange phone call. For the past two weeks, Russ had covered the death of Elvis Presley from every possible angle, including the interment at Forest Hill. He knew intimately the near-impossibility of anyone getting through those gates, let alone driving off with a casket of that weight.\n\nHe turned to Penny. \u201cThese fellas would need a crane to pull this off.\u201d\n\nRuss also knew from contacts within the Memphis PD that Shelby County deputies were working in rotation, guarding the mausoleum itself.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t enough time to wait for Saturday\u2019s shift. Right after the call with Ronnie Lee Adkins, Russ dialed his closest squad contact, Captain Tommy Smith. \u201cListen, Tommy, I just want to make sure that you guys are aware of this,\u201d Russ had said. \u201cBefore I run with this, I need to make sure I\u2019m not holding any information that could get one of your boys hurt.\u201d He repeated everything he\u2019d been told by Ronnie Lee Adkins. When he was through, Smith\u2019s answer surprised him enough that Penny froze cross the room just seeing his own reaction.\n\n\u201cYep, the grave robbery?\u201d Captain Smith had said. \u201cWe know all about it.\u201d\n\nRuss called ahead to his station manager at WMC-TV Memphis studios and requested a crew for a live feed later that night.\n\nWhile working in Nashville, it was routine to chase down hot leads with the use of 16mm film; as an anchor here in Memphis, Russ now benefited from access to the NBC affiliate\u2019s more modern equipment, namely its expensive live van. Still, he\u2019d have had to call dibs on it, since there was only the one for the entire network.\n\nBy the time he punched into his Saturday shift, Russ been on the phone with Memphis PD all day, pumping the officers for updates and keeping his name associated with the exclusivity of the story. The latter had proved easier than expected: \u201cYou know, since I brought this to you guys, I was hoping we would be allowed to get up close, watch the arrest\u2026\u201d\n\nThe cops had agreed, but by Saturday afternoon, even they weren\u2019t sure of the break-in\u2019s possible time. They\u2019d heard from their informant, but there had been no word on the time.\n\nNot knowing didn\u2019t endear the story any further to Russ\u2019 station heads, none of whom wanted their only mobile unit wandering the streets of Memphis with no guarantee of a scoop.\n\nRuss made a deal with the manager: the station\u2019s best cameraman, Bernie, drove a white Crown Vic\u2014one that could pass for an unmarked squad vehicle. Russ grabbed him on his way out the door at 9 p.m. He\u2019d ride to Forest Hill Cemetery with Bernie, and the mobile van would follow behind.\n\n\u201c 'Bubba! Don\u2019t move, man! Something\u2019s wrong\u2014we ain\u2019t alone!' \u201d\n\nRuss looked at his watch. He had the live crew for an hour and a half. After that, any grave robberies would have to be taped and edited for a later airing.\n\nClimbing into the passenger seat of Bernie\u2019s Crown Vic, Russ tuned the newsroom\u2019s communal police scanner to the familiar Memphis PD frequency, prepared to sit back and listen intently for signs of life.\n\nHe told Bernie to head towards Elvis Presley Boulevard.\n\nBubba Green had no choice but to consider the previous night\u2019s attempt as a dry run; no reason to tell the others it was a bust. At least now all three knew the lay-out: the streets and the checkpoints.\n\nIt was nearly midnight when, again in the backseat of Ronnie Lee Adkins\u2019 Chrysler, Bubba finally spotted the appliance truck in the shadow of Route 69.\n\nBubba had felt furious all day. Seeing Mike in place at the underpass, the anger finally began to subside. He hadn\u2019t been able to get him on the phone until late last night, Mike apologizing, going on and on that the appliance store employees had still been working the loading dock late into the night. He couldn\u2019t have lifted any of the trucks until today, he insisted, but tonight should be fine. Sorry, brother\u2026\n\nHe had Mike recite the plan back to him over the phone, then quizzed him on the smaller details. Satisfied, Bubba hung up and called the other two, letting them know tonight was a go.\n\nRonnie careened off of Hernando Road south towards Forest Hill. Bubba turned his head and watched the headlights on the appliance truck flash on and off, as Mike took off the opposite direction, north on Person Avenue.\n\nThey\u2019d worked it out so Mike would bust his way into the cemetery through the back. He\u2019d find Elvis\u2019 massive mausoleum first, then signal the others with his military high beam. The assortment of cutting tools would be more than enough to bust the iron gate and all that marble\u2014but they\u2019d still have to cut their way through the fence to haul the casket itself out and into the truck.\n\nThere would be no way to cut through that undetected while they were inside doing their business, as any passing car would see the truck waiting by the west entrance. Bubba figured they\u2019d have to bust it last on the way out.\n\nTen minutes to midnight. Bubba leaned forward, pointed to the coming turn street. \u201cPull up right here like last night,\u201d he said to Ronnie, then to both Ronnie and Bruce, \u201cWait here\u2014I\u2019ll hop in first, make sure Mike\u2019s in place.\u201d\n\nBubba pulled his cap low on his head as he exited to the roadside. He looked around, then hopped the cemetery fence.\n\nRuss knew he was losing his chance at a live feed after the first half-hour had passed. It was too quiet, parked there in Bernie\u2019s car outside the Forest Hill gates, even with the staccato bursts of muffled directives shooting from the scanner. With the car radio off so they could listen to the police communications, it was the first time Russ hadn\u2019t heard so much as a second of Elvis music in the past two hours.\n\n\u201cRuss, did you hear that last part?\u201d Bernie reached over and turned up the scanner\u2019s volume nob.\n\n\u201cWhat did I miss, Bernie?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Chrysler was just pulled over near the cemetery\u2026 I think I heard an officer on the two-way ask his dispatcher if an undercover was in the car.\u201d\n\nRuss bolted upright. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery possibly.\u201d\n\nIt had to be them. Russ rolled down the window of the Crown Victoria and saw Hernando Avenue coming up ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the van any minute now,\u201d he said, his voice against the wind. \u201cLet\u2019s head towards the cemetery and keep an eye.\u201d\n\nBernie was back on Elvis Presley Boulevard in five minutes. He turned off the ignition.\n\nIt was nearly 10:30 p.m. \u201cBernie,\u201d Russ said, \u201clet\u2019s keep that scanner cranked until they call back the van.\u201d\n\nBubba hit the ground running.\n\nHe\u2019d instructed Ronnie to turn the car off, not let it idle. Best be safely inside the cemetery and set up with Mike at the crypt before hollering for the others. Scaling the cemetery\u2019s gate was easy enough, Bubba landing on his hands and one knee bent. The felt the grass cool under his hands and through the rips in his jeans. He looked up into the darkness and the sea of headstones. His eyes adjusted, and the stones slowly glowed a dull, pale gray against the black of the grass and the towering oaks and maples over a century old. Mike\u2019s flashlight would be simple to spot through the 200-acre abyss.\n\nAccording to Mr. Cincinnati\u2019s aerial schematics, Elvis\u2019 mausoleum should be west from his entrance over the fence. Staying low to the ground, Bubba looked around, inching his way towards the cemetery\u2019s center.\n\nHe froze in place. Was that movement up ahead? Bubba didn\u2019t see the beams of a flashlight, nothing but the dark swaying of the trees against the lighter darkness of the sky. But he could swear something had moved among the darkened shapes up ahead.\n\nFinally, a light\u2014a flashlight.\n\nMike setting up camp at the wrong fucking grave\u2026\n\nHe watched then as the small white beam vanished\u2014then appeared again, off to the left. He froze again. It was unmistakable\u2014now there were two flashlights.\n\nEither Mike wasn\u2019t alone, or it wasn\u2019t Mike at all.\n\nThere was no more time for silence: Bubba turned around on the spot, burning his knees against the ground as he scurried back towards the fence a hundred yards away.\n\n\u201cBubba!\u201d\n\nHe looked up, seeing the outline of Ronnie and Bruce in front of the gate\u2019s railings and against the lights of the street behind. They\u2019d climbed their way inside, were both whooping and hollering, their hands in the air, making a scene.\n\n\u201cBubba!\u201d Ronnie called out again, his hands cupped to his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t move, man! Something\u2019s wrong\u2014we ain\u2019t alone!\u201d\n\nBubba climbed to his feet and ran towards the fence, noise and chaos be damned. \u201cRun, boys!\u201d he yelled, following behind as all three hopped back onto the street and made for the Chrysler. Ronnie ran around and took his place behind the wheel, gunning the engine before all the doors had slammed shut.\n\n\u201cJust go, man,\u201d Bubba barked. \u201cGo straight and just keep on goin\u2019!\u201d\n\nRonnie took a right onto Person Avenue instead, lightning fast.\n\n\u201cWhat you doin,\u2019 man?\u201d Bubba cried. \u201cI said straight!\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t matter now. The beige Chrysler pulled onto Person, stopping short just as the inevitable came into the view for all three men: a barricade of at least half a dozen black and whites, all flashing their red and blue lights and cutting off any chance of passing through.\n\nWith them was an NBC news team.\n\nFor the better part of the last two hours, Russ had sat in the passenger seat of Bernie\u2019s car, fidgeting with the wire of his mic, twirling it around his fingers like the tail of an animal. Every few minutes, Bernie double- and triple-checked the video camera on his lap.\n\nAs expected, the station had called back the mobile van. That was almost an hour and half ago. As they watched it drive off back to the network studios on Union, Russ and Bernie made themselves comfortable, both fearing a long stakeout.\n\nFinally, five minutes after midnight, the fuzzy voice of a police two-way: \u201cIt\u2019s going down.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move!\u201d Russ said, unspooling the microphone wire between his fingers. Bernie revved the engine and sped to Elvis Presley Boulevard.\n\nWhat with the lights and the shouting, Bubba couldn\u2019t tell just how many squad cars were actually settled in the trap, cutting off their escape. They all swarmed, taking each side of the Chrysler, pulling the boys out at once. All Bubba felt were the fists raining down.\n\nEverything seeming to move in slow-motion, but those Miranda Rights being spouted, those were in real-time. As the officer spread Bubba\u2019s legs and laid his hands on top of the car\u2019s hood, he watched Ronnie being taken to one car and Bruce manhandled into another.\n\nBubba felt himself cuffed and thrown into the backseat beside Bruce. Through the window, Bubba watched Ronnie slink down in the backseat of the other vehicle.\n\nSome reporter\u2014a tall, blond fellow Bubba recognized from the weekend news\u2014was aiming his microphone into Ronnie\u2019s window, trying to get him to speak while some police were shouting at him to back off, step away from the vehicle. A cameraman was with him, the weight of a huge video unit pulling his shoulder slightly down. The two men looked tied together by electrical wires.\n\nBubba let out a defeated breath. There would be no money now, he knew.\n\nThere would be no Caribbean trip or paid-off bonds and loans. Matter of fact, now there\u2019d probably be a bunch more.\n\nFuck. He\u2019d never get out of Memphis.\n\nMore reporters outside the window now, plus the cops and curious nobodies snooping around\u2014a sea of snarls and grotesques. Bubba sucked wind back through his throbbing lungs slowly, each breath a little labored and deliberate.\n\nWhile he focused on his breathing, Bubba wondered if Mike had gotten out of the cemetery all right, hoped he had hightailed it in the appliance truck and was already miles away. He hoped Mike would make it to Texas, where Mike claimed he had family and friends waiting for him with open arms.\n\n\u201c 'I ain\u2019t no cop.\u201d' Ronnie said it low, his muscles tightened against the blade. \u201d\n\nDuring the ride to Shelby County lockup, Bubba also wondered something else. Something like an itch that had been itching since Ronnie had taken it upon himself to break the silence of the night, yelling through that cemetery fence.\n\nBubba wondered why Ronnie was taken to a different car.\n\nThen he wondered how Ronnie had somehow landed them directly into a barricade of waiting police cars.\n\nPOLICE CLAIM FOILING ELVIS BODYSNATCHERS!\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)\u2014Police on a stakeout at Forest Hill Cemetery captured four men after a chase Monday, foiling what authorities said was a plot to steal Elvis Presley\u2019s body and hold it for ransom.\n\nBut one of the men was freed for lack of evidence, the other three were charged with trespassing, and a police official said the plot might be hard to prove.\n\nIn a statement, Memphis police said information was received \u201cseveral days ago\u201d that a group of people was going to enter the cemetery, break into Presley\u2019s mausoleum, steal the body and try to ransom it.\n\nActing on the tip, police kept the mausoleum under watch.\n\nOn Saturday night, the statement said, \u201csuspects were seen near the cemetery \u2026 but did not attempt to enter Forest Hill.\u201d Police were later informed, they said, \u201cthat this had been a trial run.\u201d\n\nThe stakeout continued Sunday night, and early Monday morning, \u201cfour suspects were arrested near the cemetery after having entered over the back wall, bypassing security guards, approached the mausoleum and shook the door when they were apparently frightened off.\u201d\n\nPolice Director E. Winslow Chapman said three of the men were arrested after a brief chase. The fourth was arrested at the emergency room in Baptist Hospital, where Presley was taken after he died on Aug. 16. Chapman said the fourth man apparently had sprained an ankle running from the cemetery.\n\nChapman said the police believe the men intended to use conventional burglary tools to break into the mausoleum, but he said no tools were recovered, although police searched the cemetery grounds and the route of the chase. The case against them would be weak without the tools for evidence, Chapman said.\n\nTuesday, August 30, 1977\n\nLocked up again, facing felony charges of attempted grave robbery, body snatching, and trespassing.\n\nA public defender had told Bubba in no certain terms: If it all stuck, grave-robbing would get him 99 years, but don\u2019t worry\u2014the botched attempt would only get him 33.\n\nBubba thought: in the grand scheme of things, what the fuck was the difference?\n\nThe public defender went on, \u201cYou could go up there and shoot an\u2019 kill a guy, rather than let him testify against you, put your gun down, call the po-leece, tell 'em you just shot and killed 'em, come get 'ya, and you\u2019ll get 30 years \u2026 Or you can let him get on that witness stand, testify against you, and you get 33 years\u2014if they convict 'ya.\u201d\n\nBubba had made the error of asking what had happened to dear old Ronnie Lee Adkins. Lawyer told him, also in no uncertain terms: Leave that Adkins fella alone.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what Bubba heard. The way he saw it, the lawyer just confirmed Ronnie was worth more dead than alive.\n\nBruce knew where Ronnie lived, had his address written down. Having used what little money he had left to post bail\u2014Blue Barron always won in the end\u2014Bubba went round to Bruce, told him the new plan, to be implemented immediately.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna put the fear of God into Ronnie,\u201d he\u2019d told Bruce. \u201cLet him think his life is on the line, he gets up on that stand and throws us all under a bus.\u201d\n\nThey rode over in Bruce\u2019s car, playing it cool and getting Ronnie into the front seat of the car, in the passenger\u2019s seat for once. Bubba got in back and instructed Bruce to drive them down Poplar Avenue all the way downtown. He told him not to stop until he could see the marshes and the Mississippi River out in front.\n\nParked, Ronnie felt cold steel come whip around under his chin.\n\n\u201cYou messed up real good,\u201d Bubba hissed, pressing the tip of his butterfly knife tight against Ronnie\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple. He ran it slow along the scratchy grain of Ronnie\u2019s stubble. \u201cReal good, informing on the wrong people this time. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said.\n\nBehind the wheel, Bruce kept a lookout for tourists. They came down here sometime to get a nice view of Mud Island. Ronnie kept his mouth tight, let Bubba keep talking. \u201cSee, you\u2019re worth way more to me now dead than alive,\u201d Bubba said. \u201cLawyer told me so. And I listen to the law, now on.\u201d\n\nBruce cracked the window. Near silence where they were, the wind through the marshes and the soft lapping of the shore nearby.\n\n\u201cWe got friends,\u201d Bubba said, his grip on the knife and its place at Ronnie\u2019s jugular frozen still. \u201cAnd they got friends, and you know, friends of friends. Way I see it, you\u2019re in a no-win situation. You agree?\u201d\n\nHe loosened his grip just enough for Ronnie to slowly nod without cutting himself against the blade.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good,\u201d he said, \u201creal good, Ronnie. So, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do: we\u2019re going to drive you up to Baptist Memorial Hospital, drop you off, and you\u2019re gonna tell them you\u2019re a Memphis City policeman suffering chest pains the last few days. But you hear me? You fucking tell them you\u2019re a cop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t no cop.\u201d Ronnie said it low, his muscles tightened against the blade.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t matter to me,\u201d said Bubba. \u201cNot at this point. But you\u2019re gonna tell them that, get pinched for impersonation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would I do that? We all already facing charges, man.\u201d\n\nBubba tightened his grip again. \u201cI want you discredited, got it? You even think about turning us out on that witness stand, I want you seen as a lying sack of shit whose word ain\u2019t worth nothing. Your testimony won\u2019t be no good. I already know you\u2019re a liar\u2014but I want it on fucking record you\u2019re one.\u201d\n\nHe paused, listened to the stillness surrounding the car. Seagulls hung over the river. \u201cI mean,\u201d he said, flicking the butterfly back into its sheath, \u201cthere\u2019s more truth in that than anything else, right?\u201d\n\nELVIS RETURNS HOME!\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)\u2014In death, Elvis Presley returned to his mansion in much the same manner as he went in life\u2014with secrecy and tight security.\n\nTwo white hearses carried the bodies of Presley and his mother, Gladys Smith Presley, from Forest Hill Cemetery to the grounds of Graceland unannounced Sunday night.\n\nThe hearses, escorted by eight Memphis policemen and five Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s deputies, traveled south without disruption down Elvis Presley Boulevard, three miles from the cemetery to the mansion.\n\nThe Presley family received unanimous approval from zoning officials last week for the transfer. Lawyers for the family said security and privacy were reasons for the request as well as the inconvenience caused to other families with loved ones at the cemetery by Elvis crowds.\n\nAbout 100 fans watched as the hearses entered the mansion grounds from the rear entrance shortly after 7 p.m.\n\nTuesday, October 4, 1977\n\nThe story ran on WMC-TV on Sunday morning. It wasn\u2019t the live feed Russ had envisioned, catching the grave robbers redhanded, but he\u2019d still gotten the scoop Ronnie Lee Adkins promised.\n\nRuss\u2019 observation that the Crown Victoria closely resembled an unmarked squad car proved correct: The cops had waved them right through the Forest Hill gates. At Elvis\u2019 mausoleum, he\u2019d leapt out and quickly struck a pose with the mic, reporting the night\u2019s events against the mausoleum\u2019s marble wall. They used the car\u2019s high-beams to light the shot. Russ then shot a clip inside Elvis\u2019 private chamber.\n\n\u201c Elvis\u2019 grave would always remain the only part of the Graceland tour that was free of charge. \u201d\n\nSpliced together with Bernie\u2019s footage of Raymond \u201cBubba\u201d Green, Bruce Nelson, and Ronnie Lee Adkins being carted away, the completed clip aired as Sunday\u2019s lead story. Phone calls started almost immediately, Russ\u2019 NBC parents and the National Enquirer within the first few hours of its airing.\n\nThe Enquirer should have known better than push Russ and Bernie to hand over even a single frame to a competitive news source. But when it came to the honchos at their parent network, any footage shot with studio equipment was up for grabs. They handed over the raw footage, seeing every NBC affiliate in America use the material for their own coverage on the story.\n\nForget taking a bullet on Dick Clark\u2019s blooper reel. On August 29, Russ finally reached a national audience\u2014just as he had promised the station managers.\n\nAs he had expected, new of the attempted theft of the King\u2019s body quickly spread, especially in Memphis. Only weeks after Elvis had been tucked and shelved in his mink-lined crypt, the botched grave robbery proved another excuse for Elvis\u2019 wide-reaching constituency to gather en masse around both Forest Hill and the locked gates of Graceland.\n\nAlso as he expected, Russ had to cover it all for WMC-TV Memphis: the arrests, the aftermath, the eventual arraignment and, finally that October, the most unexpected twist of it all\u2014the dismissal.\n\nIt was months later that Russ was again at Shelby County District Court, watching in disbelief as a judge announced that Green, Nelson, and Adkins were to be set free, let go, the judge declaring Adkins as too unreliable a witness to even take his word at face value.\n\nOnly Russ knew Adkins had been the tipster, the informant\u2026 the one to call him at home, for Chrissake. No one in law enforcement would say it in a courtroom, but Russ wondered if the judge been fed instructions to let Adkins walk, his clandestine status within the Memphis PD earning him some form of immunity.\n\nOr, Russ also wondered, had someone gotten to the judge?\n\nRuss never got the answer, but he did cover every detail of the grave robbery\u2019s strange aftermath. The same week as the delinquent crew\u2019s dismissal, Vernon Presley successfully circumvented the longstanding zoning codes in Shelby County, granting him permission for the legal transfer of his beloved son and wife, Gladys, back to Graceland. He wanted them home, under the shade of the trees in the backyard, right there beside Elvis\u2019 swimming pool.\n\nThe Presley family later called it The Meditation Garden, even put up a plaque.\n\nLater on, after Graceland later became Memphis\u2019 greatest tourist attraction, drawing thousands of fans from around the world to take the tour, see his shag-carpeted living room and his famed white porcelain monkey, his gold Cadillac and personal jets parked outside, and his sequined jumpsuits and matching capes, all under glass next to a television set he\u2019d used for target practice\u2026 Even then, Elvis\u2019 grave would always remain the only part of the tour that was free of charge.\n\nElvis loved visitors.\n\nBefore he and Penny moved on to Denver a few years later, Russ Ruffin decided that Memphis\u2014Elvis\u2019 Memphis\u2014had been good to him.\n\nYears later, long after his Memphis days, Russ remembered something.\n\nHe had been finishing up breakfast with Penny, thumbing through that morning\u2019s newspaper and saw an article that jogged loose memory from 1977: It was right before the dismissal at Shelby County Court.\n\nThat week in September, Russ had received another phone call at home and hadn\u2019t thought about it in over 20 years. When it had happened, however, he had half-expected the call to be from Ronnie Lee Adkins, since another hearing was coming up.\n\nIt had been a weekday, Russ remembered, Penny out running errands when the kitchen phone rang.\n\n\u201cThis Russ Ruffin from the TV?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Ronnie, it was another voice, a new one only slightly familiar. \u201cIt sure is,\u201d Russ said, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, the voice taking a deep breath before going on. \u201cWell, you know who I am, but we ain\u2019t ever actually spoke\u2026 Name\u2019s Raymond Green.\u201d\n\nRuss had watched Bubba Green\u2019s arraignment the previous week. Russ reached for his pad and pen. \u201cWell, hello there, Mr. Green. Yes, I do know your name, and I\u2019ve been covering everything about your case, as you may know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cListen\u2026 Just so you know, it ain\u2019t nothing like you heard.\u201d\n\nRuss didn\u2019t say a word, let the man continue.\n\n\u201cYou know, my story I mean,\u201d said Bubba Green. \u201cWhat you seen in the newspapers. Nothing like you heard. I got a story for you\u2014after my hearing.\u201d\n\nBut after the hearing, Bubba Green was gone. So was Ronnie Lee Adkins.\n\nRuss remembered all of that, sitting in his kitchen in Denver, reading the newspaper and tearing out an article to show Penny across the table.\n\nThe story in the paper was about a former FBI informant changing his name in Witness Protection. Ronnie Tyler.\n\nFBI WITNESS: PRESLEY CLAN STAGED GRAVE-ROBBING\n\nInformant says pop hatched plot to move King\u2019s plot to Graceland\n\n(WorldNetDaily) MEMPHIS, Tenn.\n\nAugust 15, 2002\n\nAn FBI informant involved in a plot to steal Elvis Presley\u2019s body shortly after the rock idol died 25 years ago claims the Presley family staged the grave-robbing to persuade Memphis officials to move him from the public cemetery to Graceland, now a $15 million-a-year tourist attraction, a veteran FBI agent told WorldNetDaily.\n\nThe late Vernon Presley, \u201cthe King\u2019s\u201d father and executor of his estate at the time, wanted his son buried on mansion grounds, but it was not an area zoned for burials.\n\nSo three weeks after Elvis died of a heart attack, he had lawyers for the Presley estate petition the Memphis Shelby County Board of Adjustment for a zoning variance. They cited what they called an attempted theft of Presley\u2019s body several days earlier and the expense of round-the-clock security.\n\nThree men were arrested Aug. 29, 1977, near the Forest Hill Cemetery mausoleum where Elvis was entombed in a 900-pound copper coffin. One of them was Ronnie Tyler, who later became an FBI informant.\n\nTyler \u201chad been in cahoots with a crooked deputy sheriff, who swooped down and \u2018captured\u2019 the thieves,\u201d said Ivian C. Smith, former head of the FBI\u2019s Arkansas office. \u201cThe scheme had been hatched after the Memphis board had refused the Presley family\u2019s request to bury Elvis at Graceland,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Memphis board on Sept. 28, 1977 OK\u2019d Presley\u2019s request to move his son\u2019s body to Graceland. And the singer, dressed in a white suit with dark-blue tie and light-blue shirt, was reburied there Oct. 2.\n\n\u201cAfter the \u2018theft,\u2019 the county made an exception to the law\u201d\u2014and Tyler was charged with misdemeanor trespassing,\u201d said Smith.\n\nAUTHOR\u2019S NOTE ON SOURCES\n\nThis article was written with the aid of Russell Ruffin, who was generous enough to offer a comprehensive interview regarding his participation in the original arrests of Ronnie Lee Adkins, Raymond Green, and Bruce Nelson.\n\nLikewise, the Shelby County Historical Commission was patient and helpful in supplying details and fact-checking for dates and details regarding the numerous events and media coverage of Elvis Presley\u2019s death and burial in August 1977.\n\nQuotes and details regarding Raymond Green are courtesy of Tri-Marq Communications and WTMJ Television, Milwaukee, which provided the only existing transcripts of Green\u2019s initial interviews.\n\nRonnie Lee Adkins, now Tyler, remains an active informant for the FBI, and his background information and current whereabouts do not fall under the guidelines of the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nOther sources include:\n\nGuralnick, Peter.
