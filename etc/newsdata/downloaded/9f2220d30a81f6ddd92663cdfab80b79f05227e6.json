(file image)\n\nHe was accused of using 'the secrecy of the circumstances to assault young, vulnerable women off-camera for his own personal pleasure,' say the court papers prepared by attorney Brian Holm, who represents 22 Jane Does in the civil trial, reports the Daily Beast.\n\nThe plaintiffs said they expected the videos would land in the hands of private distributors and that their names would be kept out of the footage. Instead, the plaintiffs claim their scenes were immediately put online, and their identities were exposed.\n\nA federal indictment unsealed on October 10 in San Diego also charged Garcia, Pratt, and two other Girls Do Porn employees with sex trafficking. Garcia, who was arrested, and Pratt, who has fled the country and is wanted as a fugitive, have both maintained their innocence, reports Daily Beast.\n\nDetails of the rape and assault allegations against Garcia are mentioned in court documents from the civil case, but have not emerged during the trial because six of the plaintiffs who say they are Garcia's victims dropped the charges.\n\nThe women wanted 'to avoid the trauma of plaintiffs having to relive these events,' court records say.\n\nA civil suit alleged Garcia and others at Girls Do Porn, including the company's owner Michael Pratt (pictured above), preyed on women who struggled financially and came to work for the San Diego-based company believing explicit scenes they filmed would go straight to DVD\n\nThat means the allegations most likely won't be heard at all throughout the remainder of the ongoing trial, which is expected to wrap up by month's end.\n\nA 2015 police report and excerpts from victim depositions were used by Holm as evidence for the assault allegations made against Garcia in the civil trial.\n\nMore than 100 women with stories of being defrauded by the company were interviewed, and almost two dozen alleged that Garcia had raped, sexually assaulted or attempted to sexual assault them.\n\nSeveral common threads emerged from the stories Holm heard in the interviews and and depositions. Most women said Garcia would try to lure them back to his apartment, for different reasons.\n\nThe civil trial notes how Girls Do Porn has operated under different names. One of the company's logos is pictured above\n\nOne excuse he allegedly gave was that he lived close to the airport and that he was in charge of making sure that women who had come in from out of town to work for Girls Do Porn caught their flights back home.\n\nOther women said that he would come up with an excuse to stop by his apartment while driving them around, and that he would invite them upstairs.\n\nGarcia is also accused of hanging around after a shoot, waiting till he was alone with women he had just been filmed with to make his move. Sometimes his alleged attacks took place in his car.\n\nThe actor also is accused of posing as a Girls Do Porn contact named Jonathan, who was responsible for arranging the job, and who in a text to a woman said she was being kicked out of her hotel and that she should stay at Garcia's apartment. The woman later learned that Jonathan was an alias used by Garcia, reports DailyBeast.\n\nOnce alone with his alleged victims, Garcia would start off proposing consensual sex, and say 'that the woman was the most attractive woman he has ever filmed, that the woman should quit what she was doing and move to San Diego to be his 'girlfriend,' and that he could take care of her if she moved here because he is rich,' Holm writes in the civil filing.\n\nGarcia is also accused of calling one woman his 'sex slave,' according to emails read aloud during a deposition.\n\nJane Doe No 2 in the civil case, said during a May 2017 declaration, that Garcia approached her after filming with a line about how 'pretty' she was, that I should be his girlfriend, how he had a really nice car and that he and I should hang out.'\n\nAfter she said no, Garcia allegedly still offered to drive her to her car, and while in his Range Rover, kept going past the woman's vehicle, instead of stopping to drop her off. After Garcia allegedly made sexual advances, Jane Doe No. 2 said she tried to leave, but he 'began to play with the electronic locks' to prevent her.\n\n'He then climbed over the center console and he tried to mount me,' she says in the court documents. 'As he was doing so, I slid underneath him into the backseat, hoping to escape the vehicle through the back doors'.\n\n'However, those doors were locked too and I was unable to quickly figure out how to open them,' she continued. 'Garcia followed me into the back seat and prevented me from opening the back door.'\n\nThe woman noted that Garcia 'is a larger male and was easily able to overpower my attempts to get away.' She claims Garcia 'forcibly' removed her clothes after she told him to stop and he wouldn't.\n\n'Garcia then had intercourse with me in the back seat of the Range Rover without my consent,' she said. 'I told him to stop several times but he would not.'\n\nHolm submitted a 2015 police report filed in Newport, Beach, California with a similar account made by a different woman.\n\nThe victim, another anonymous woman, said she went to work for Girls Do Porn after responding to a 'Begin Modelling' advert made on Craigslist. The civil trial notes how Girls Do Porn has operated under different names, reports DailyBeast.\n\nThe woman made three films for the company between September 10 and October 1, 2015, and after the third said she found herself alone with Garcia. He again is alleged to have used his pick-up lines, after refusing her request to call for an Uber. He said she was 'the best girl I've been with,' according to the report.\n\nShe turned him down when he asked her to be his girlfriend, saying she already was taken. Garcia, undeterred, offered her $1,000 and a shopping spree if she agreed to visit him San Diego 'sometime'.\n\nThe woman said she declined, setting Gracia off. He allegedly grabbed and shook her, demanding she be his girlfriend, as she kept saying 'no.'\n\nHe then raped her during a 20-minute ordeal, the police report states.\n\nThe woman said she got dressed, texted her boyfriend and called for a ride, as Garcia acted 'very nice,' called her 'baby', asked why she was mad, and again asked her to be his girlfriend.\n\nShe again declined and accused Garcia of even showing up to her boyfriend's home in Laguna Beach, demanding she go with him. When she threatened to call cops, Garcia is alleged to have left.", "description": "Girls Do Porn actor Andre Garcia was said to have sexually assaulted more than two dozen women, who allege in a civil suit that the company conned them into doing adult films that were posted online.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
