At 16, she moved from her native Sydney, Australia to New York City where she stayed in model apartments and AirBNBs by herself. Unlike Liam's ex wife Miley Cyrus, Maddison Brown says she has always avoided the party scene. 'I've lived overseas on my own so I haven't had the bond of the parents going away meaning a party,' she told i-d magazine in 2014. 'I remember the first time I went overseas on my own my agent said, now don't get into the partying. And I was just like, trust me it's not going to happen.' She considers herself an old soul, telling the publication: 'Sometimes, I feel like I have trouble connecting with people my own age because I've been working for so long. But then I have trouble connecting to people in their late 20s and 30s because I feel like there is such a big age gap. I don't know. It's about finding the right people I guess.' During her time as a model, she chalked up campaigns with Miu Miu, Calvin Klein, Jason Wu and Marchesa.
