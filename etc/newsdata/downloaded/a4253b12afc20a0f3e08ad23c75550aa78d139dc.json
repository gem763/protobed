We have put hundreds of engineers to work to ensure that this airplane is 100 percent ready,\u201d says Jennifer Henderson, chief test pilot for the 737, in one of the clips.\n\n\u201cWhen the 737 MAX returns to service I will absolutely put my family on this airplane,\u201d she stressed.\n\nBut on a Facebook page for Boeing enthusiasts where the clip was posted, the response is negative.\n\n\u201cWell, I think she could not say it would be unsafe,\u201d one member quipped, as Boeing faces the Herculean task of trying to regain the confidence of civil aviation authorities and the public, seven months after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines MAX that killed 157 people.\n\nThat came after the downing of a Lion Air MAX in Indonesia in October 2018, killing 189, with the plane\u2019s MCAS anti-stall system being blamed in both accidents.\n\nIt\u2019s not known when the MAX will return to service. Boeing, which still has not submitted a modified version of the MCAS system to regulators, hopes it will be before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe 737 Max is, for now, an \u2018airplane non grata\u2019 \u2014 a plane passengers do not want to fly,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cTravelers aren\u2019t merely scared of the 737 MAX, they\u2019re terrified of it.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Irresponsible\u2019 \u2013\n\nJust 19 percent of business travelers and 14 percent of leisure travelers would willingly take the 737 MAX within six months of returning to the sky, according to an Atmosphere survey.\n\nNearly half of the 2,000 respondents said they would pay more to avoid the MAX.\n\nFaced with this distrust, airlines are adapting.\n\n\u201cWe will be transparent \u2014 and communicate in advance \u2014 with our customers who are booked to fly on a MAX aircraft, will rebook those who do not want to fly on a MAX at no charge, and for some time will not swap aircraft to a MAX if a change of aircraft is required,\u201d said a spokesperson at United Airlines, which owns 14 MAX aircraft.\n\nAmerican Airlines, which has 24 MAX planes, has said its company brass and employees will be the first to fly on the aircraft once it\u2019s cleared to return to the sky.\n\nThe MAX\u2019s setbacks have cast a shadow over a century of history at Boeing, a highlight of which was the success of its 747 jumbo jet, nicknamed the \u201cQueen of the skies.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harteveldt, half of business passengers and 55 percent of leisure passengers consider Boeing to be \u201cirresponsible,\u201d \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201cunsafe.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s management has addressed the trust issue.\n\n\u201cWe know that trust has been damaged over the last few months and we own that and we are working hard to re-earn that trust going forward,\u201d CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in August.\n\nThe trust may have been tested again on Friday, when it emerged that some potentially significant documents at Boeing were held back from investigators for months.\n\nBoeing says it has conducted 1,447 flight test hours as of October 13 with the modified MCAS, and Muilenburg personally took part in two tests.\n\nFrom late September to mid-October, the company also invited airline pilots to simulator training and information sessions in Miami, London, Istanbul, Shanghai and Singapore.\n\n\u201cBoeing has no choice but to get it right this time, however uncomfortable that may be for now,\u201d said Tracy Stewart, an editor at airfarewatchdog.com.\n\nIf Boeing can take comfort in anything, it may be that most travelers do not look up which jet they will fly when booking tickets.\n\nMost commercial passengers are \u201cworried about getting an aisle seat, and hoping the overhead bin will still have space for a carry on,\u201d said John Dekker of online travel agency Surf City Travel.\n\nSome experts said one of the best ways for Boeing to regain credibility is to release a video explaining the changes to the 737 MAX to make it safer.\n\nThey must \u201cmake sure they have informed the consumer that it won\u2019t happen again\u2026 PERIOD!\u201d said Dekker.", "description": "New York (AFP) \u2013 On September 12, Boeing started putting out 30-second videos in which employees tout its planes\u2019 safety, hoping to reassure", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/a6078a_boeing-737-max-soars-overhead-paris-air-in-2017-boeing-it-fly-but-travelers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
