They've got great desserts, too. We'd go to town on those nights. I was crushing it. When it's not catered, we're on our own to cook. We get a grocery list and can put whatever we want on it.\n\n'And then it's just a fight for the kitchen and who gets to the stove first. We ended up cooking for each other a lot.

Cameron stretched out his muscles out in the park\n\n'Nah, you don't touch that food,' he insisted. 'It's more for show. We get to eat before the dates, usually from the same restaurant. It's still real food on the plate\u2014you could eat it, but it's a little cold by then.
