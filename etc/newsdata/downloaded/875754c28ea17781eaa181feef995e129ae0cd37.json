Nearly two-thirds \u2014 64% \u2014 of small-business owners (SBOs) surveyed by Capital One (COF) are calling current business conditions good or excellent.\n\nMargaret Donnell, head of Customer Experience for Capital One\u2019s Small Business Bank, told Yahoo Finance that \u201cit's an all-time high since our Great Recession, and up five percentage points from our last survey.\u201d Recession fears are down five points, according to the survey.\n\nCapital One regularly updates its Small Business Growth Index, which tracks sentiment among SBOs relating to a broader economic outlook, recession concerns, plans for hiring and growth, and more.\n\nDonnell explained that \u201crecession fatigue\u201d could be assuaging some fears, but that the continued talk of a potential downturn has kept SBOs \u201cpreparing for the unexpected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we're hearing from small-business owners is that now is the time to prepare,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of them are consulting with financial advisors, business bankers, thinking about: when they have that unexpected cash flow need, how they prepare for it. We are headed into a lower interest rate market, so now is a good time for them to secure funding.\u201d\n\nAmid lower recession fears, SBOs are also showing continued strength in hiring. Thirty percent plan to hire in the next six months.\n\n\u201cWe're actually seeing more and more small business owners trend towards contingent workers,\u201d Donnell said \u201cThey're able to hire as they need, but also need to pare down and they can do that.\u201d\n\nDemographically, millennial (50%), minority (40%) and women (35%) small-business owners are more likely to have plans to hire than other SBOs, and the sentiment divide is noticeable among generations.\n\n\u201cMillennials are some of our more optimistic group,\u201d Donnell told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThey actually entered the workforce at a time when they were going through a recession, and many leaned into being entrepreneurs themselves. So they remember that experience and they are prepared for it \u2014 or at least they tell us they are.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Katie on Twitter: @hashtagkatie.\n\nRead More:\n\nRead the latest stocks and stock market news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.", "description": "Nearly two-thirds of small-business owners surveyed by Capital One are calling current business conditions good or excellent.", "authors": ["Katie Krzaczek", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v9fuJZe5QkWUij1SPMA6gQ--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/985a0520-e92c-11e9-bdfd-5bb7d06ba4de", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
