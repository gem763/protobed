Would these two pair excellently together?", "language": "en", "text": "I was encouraged by the profile submitted by Jake Halpin. On paper, the self-described liberal seemed thoughtful and funny. He listed his greatest luxury as \u201ca personal time-keeping device (a watch)\u201d and preferences ranging from soccer and the Beatles to \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and taking the bus rather than Uber. Sifting through potential candidates for his time and possible affection, I kept returning to Emily Platt. A few of her favorite things included the book \u201cBad Blood,\u201d Michelle Obama, the Philadelphia Eagles and singer John Legend.\n\nNeither could recall a worst date. Both are interested in politics. Emily could even imagine herself running for office someday. They also shared an appreciation for food that went beyond the usual. Emily, who counts her biggest indulgence as dinner at Rose\u2019s Luxury, is the chief cook in her group household, where everybody but her is either vegan or vegetarian. (She eats fish and some meat.) On his Date Lab application, Jake, a fan of breweries and craft cocktails, wrote \u201cloving good food is a must.\u201d Both flagged an Indian dish as among their foods of choice \u2014 Jake goes for chicken tikka masala, Emily likes butter chicken \u2014 which prompted me to send them to Karma Modern Indian downtown. For this Very Special Edition of Date Lab, I also agreed to join them for dessert.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey both showed up early for their 6:30 reservation. \u201cI\u2019m never early for a date,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI knew I had to be for this one.\u201d Friends in her office seemed to be more into the meet-and-eat than she was, telling her, \u201cDon\u2019t mess this up!\u201d She found Jake to be \u201cvery cute, tall and very friendly,\u201d so much so that he put his arm around her while they were taking predinner Date Lab photos. Jake, who went into Karma with a positive attitude \u2014 \u201cgood or bad, this will be something to remember\u201d \u2014 said Emily\u2019s \u201cwarm, welcoming smile\u201d told him \u201cthis is going to be a fun date.\u201d\n\nCocktails followed. They both got different drinks topped with whipped egg whites. And they both agreed to order things they hadn\u2019t tried before. Enlisting the help of their server, they ordered enough food to write a review of the place: tandoori shrimp with mango salsa, pan-seared scallops with a red pepper sauce, a grilled vegetable platter that included star fruit, branzino with spinach, stuffed bread and a mushroom biryani.\n\n\u201cAs first dates go, this was one of the best,\u201d says Emily. She found Jake to be engaging and a good listener. \u201cIt was a pretty good match. We had a lot in common.\u201d While Jake was born in England, he grew up in New Jersey, just like Emily. Both had parents who lived in Delaware. They shared an interest in music, too. Emily jams with friends at house parties \u2014 with a ukulele. Jake has played violin with an orchestra at his college near Boston.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe flow was great,\u201d says Jake. \u201cShe asked a lot of questions and [the conversation] never felt forced.\u201d\n\nWhile they were passing plates, ordering wine and connecting more dots, I walked to the restaurant and waited until they texted me that it was time for dessert. As I approached Karma, I happened to catch a couple in a second dining room, near the front window. Them! And animated, as best as I could tell. I sat on a bench nearby until Emily gave me the green light.\n\nEnter the chaperone, or the dad figure. At least that\u2019s how I felt. As often as I dine with strangers for work, I have to admit I was a little tentative about interrupting what I imagined to be their good time. But Jake and Emily turned three\u2019s a crowd into three\u2019s company, peppering me with as many questions as I had for them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTheir take on Karma? \u201cEverything was superlative,\u201d says Jake, who appreciated the twists on Indian tradition. Emily raved about the drinks list, the service and the \u201celevated Indian food,\u201d but remains loyal to Rasika. (The three of us agreed the desserts were a little busy and overly sweet.)\n\nShortly after I left \u2014 around 10:30 \u2014 Jake and Emily did, too. Jake waited with Emily for her Uber to arrive, at which point they hugged (twice) and he asked for her digits. When Jake got home, he texted Emily and invited her to go to the National Zoo after she returned from a beach trip.\n\nNo matter what transpires between them, I\u2019ve found future dining companions: Separately, Jake and Emily let me know they would enjoy tagging along on a restaurant review.\n\nAD\n\nRate the date\n\nJake 4.5 [out of 5]. \u201cIt was a really good date\u201d if \u201ca bit more friendly than romantic.\u201d\n\nEmily 5. \u201cTime flew by.\u201d\n\nUpdate\n\nJake had to postpone the second date due to a work conflict, but the two are trying to reschedule.\n\nTom Sietsema is the Washington Post food critic.\n\nAD", "description": "We interrupt these foodies for a third party.", "authors": ["Tom Sietsema", "Food Critic"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YzVd2nPo0l4Z6kgsaVe1aO7j0sY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JPRRVAGUYEI6TE2DIDNVPT3KXU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
