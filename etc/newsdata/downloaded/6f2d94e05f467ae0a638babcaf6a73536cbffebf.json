(Oct. 28) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence doesn\u2019t believe the House voting to impeach President Donald Trump is a \u201cforegone conclusion.\"\n\nIn an interview that aired Monday on PBS NewsHour, Pence firmly defended Trump, reiterating multiple times that there was no \u201cquid quo pro\u201d with Ukraine and criticizing the Democrats' handling of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf the House goes ahead and votes to impeach the president, what do you believe will happen in the United States Senate? Do you believe they will convict the president and remove him from office?\u201d PBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff asked Pence.\n\nHe answered, \u201cWell, let's be clear first that I don't take it as a foregone conclusion that the House will \u2014 will vote to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nVice President Pence in an interview with @NewsHour: \"I don't take it as a foregone conclusion that the House will vote to impeach President Donald Trump.\" pic.twitter.com/dqfm9Q1Juo \u2014 PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cI mean, as the American people take a look at the facts in this case, they read the transcript, it was so mischaracterized by the whistleblower, and grossly mischaracterized by Chairman Adam Schiff in his fabricated version of the phone call that he read into the committee,\u201d Pence continued. \u201cBut when people read the transcript, they will see, despite the reckless allegations of many in the media, there was no quid pro quo. President (Volodymyr) Zelensky himself said there was no pressure, that it was a perfectly good phone call. The president did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\n'Too tough on the president?': Mitt Romney: a solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party\n\nA majority of House members have said they support the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPence railed against House Democrats for how they\u2019ve conducted the impeachment investigation, blaming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for \u201cunilaterally\u201d opening the inquiry.\n\nPelosi declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 and said an umbrella of six committees would continue to investigate Trump and his administration for possible offenses such as abuse of power and obstruction of justice. Her declaration came amid reports about the president\u2019s call July 25 to Ukraine's president, when Trump urged an investigation of his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nEarlier Monday, it was announced that the House of Representatives will vote this week to formalize impeachment inquiry procedures after weeks of resisting a full House vote and unrelenting attacks by Republicans for holding depositions behind closed doors.\n\nPelosi sent a letter to members that outlined the resolution, which seeks to combat a key line of Republican attack: that the impeachment inquiry was illegitimate because there was no House vote on it.\n\nImpeachment: DOJ appeals order to release secret evidence gathered by Robert Mueller in Russia investigation\n\nRepublicans on the Hill and within Trump's administration have bemoaned the handling of the inquiry because of this with about three dozen House GOP members storming the gates of Defense Department official Laura Cooper\u2019s testimony last week.\n\n\u201cAs the facts all come out, I think the American people will come to understand that and I expect let their voice be heard on Capitol Hill,\u201d Pence added.\n\nForty-seven Republicans on the committees leading the investigation have had access to the closed-door depositions.\n\nPence called the inquiry against Trump \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and demeaned damaging testimonies from government officials as mere \u201cleaks.\u201d\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes, Bart Jensen and Nicholas Wu, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/28/mike-pence-not-foregone-conclusion-house-impeach-donald-trump/2492311001/", "description": "In an interview on PBS NewsHour, Vice President Mike Pence called the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump \u201ca disgrace.\"", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
