Among them: We Work, Lyft, Robinhood, OYO, and Tesla.\n\nOvervalued unicorns:\n\n\u2014 Pinterest\n\n\u2014 Snap\n\n\u2014 Twitter\n\n\u2014 Peloton\n\n\u2014 Slack\n\n\u2014 DoorDash\n\n\u2014 Lime\n\n\u2014 Palantir\n\n\u2014 Uber\n\n\u2014 Compass Will lose 80% or disappear:\n\n\u2014 Tesla\n\n\u2014 WeWork\n\n\u2014 Robinhood\n\n\u2014 Lyft\n\n\u2014 OYO#nomercynomalice https://t.co/Uw2GgOIevf \u2014 Scott Galloway (@profgalloway) October 4, 2019\n\nWhile the first four may not be huge shockers, adding Tesla to the list looks a bit controversial given the company\u2019s record-setting pace in Q3. But, if you look a little closer, things beneath the surface don\u2019t appear so tranquil.\n\nA leaked email obtained by Elektrek indicated the company was on pace to deliver more than 100,000 cars in Q3, which would be a record. Unfortunately for Musk and co., this milestone comes at the expense of profitability. According to a report from The Motley Fool:\n\nTesla will probably report another sizable loss for the third quarter, even excluding stock-based compensation, which is a massive expense in itself. Normal-course cost reductions may enable Tesla to reduce its losses over time, but they don\u2019t represent a path to sustainable profitability.\n\nGalloway\u2019s prediction appears based on similar logic. Here\u2019s the Tesla-relevant snippet from his blog:\n\nDear Twitter trolls: yes \u2026 I\u2019m an idiot, I can\u2019t do, so I teach, and I don\u2019t understand genius. It\u2019s a tech/energy play. I get it\u2026 Save your breath. Yes, he is a genius, Tesla has changed the world for the better (I believe this). And \u2026 Tesla doesn\u2019t have the scale to compete in a well-run, low-margin business \u2014 auto.\n\nWhile anyone who\u2019s written about Elon Musk with a.. shall we say, \u2018less than positive\u2019 spin, can empathize with Galloway\u2019s tongue-in-cheek defensiveness, his simple point is that Tesla doesn\u2019t appear to have a viable plan to become profitable. Despite promises about advances in batteries and cutting marginal costs from third-party parts providers, there\u2019s little reason to believe Tesla can brute-force its way into the black.\n\nThe company\u2019s current big claim to the future is Musk\u2019s promise that Tesla will field a million fully autonomous \u2018robotaxis\u2019 sometime before the end of 2020. Experts in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics say this claim is ridiculous. Rodney Brooks and Kai Fu Lee, for example, said they\u2019ll eat all one million of those cars if that happens.\n\nIf there are a million Tesla robo-taxis functioning on the road in 2020, I will eat them. Perhaps @rodneyabrooks will eat half with me? https://t.co/NEVnU4Jjgy \u2014 Kai-Fu Lee (@kaifulee) May 8, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that Tesla would have no trouble turning a profit if it were to invent, develop, manufacture, and field one million fully-autonomous robotaxis by the end of 2020. But, considering that the number of driverless cars capable of level five autonomy in existence is currently zero, it\u2019s unlikely Brooks and Lee will lose their bet.\n\nGalloway says Tesla will either disappear or lose eighty percent of its value. According to him, \u201cThe unicorn barn is on fire. Ablaze.\u201d And, in truest form, Musk\u2018s making fart noises in the inferno\u2019s general direction:\n\n\ud83d\udca8 & \ud83d\udc10 sounds too (also, of course) \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 6, 2019\n\nTo be more specific, Musk announced on Twitter over the weekend that Tesla owners will soon be able to customize their vehicle\u2019s running and horn sounds. Among the options, of course, is a fart sound.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fmusk_toot.jpg&signature=2bbf76b7675022ddf24e3f91372646a9", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
