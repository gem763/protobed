They have absolutely nothing in common, but the names are similar enough that we\u2019ve never been able to talk to anyone else about Outer Wilds without both parties having to clarify which game they mean. It\u2019s an unfortunate state of affairs because Outer Wilds is one of the best and most original games of the year and deserves all the attention it can get.\n\nOuter Wilds was originally released on Xbox One and PC in May but for some reason the PlayStation 4 version was delayed until now. Apart from being \u00a31 cheaper there are no differences, which is exactly what you\u2019d expect given that this isn\u2019t a game that pushes any format in terms of technology (which makes it odd that there\u2019s been no sign of a Switch version).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a link to our full review of the Xbox One version below but the gist of it is that you\u2019re playing as an alien astronaut out minding his own business on a camping trip, when you discover the local sun is about to go supernova in 22 minutes. That\u2019s not enough time to do anything about it and yet when disaster strikes you suddenly find yourself alive again\u2026 22 minutes before the supernova is about to go off.\n\nAs a cross between Groundhog Day and Zelda: Majora\u2019s Mask, that\u2019s a great premise for a video game and accordingly Outer Wilds has a very old school charm to it. Despite the scenario there\u2019s no real violence or aggression and you\u2019re given complete freedom to explore and work out the enjoyably complex puzzles on your own. Complex, not in that they\u2019re especially difficulty but because they so imaginatively use the situation and environment (and a few high-tech gadgets) to create a game that\u2019s a pleasure to get lost in.\n\nWe\u2019ve no idea if Outer Wilds has been a success or not but it really is one of the best indie games of the year and absolutely worth seeking out on any format.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ORIGINAL FULL REVIEW OF OUTER WILDS\n\nOuter Wilds PS4 review summary In Short: A fantastically imaginative, time-bending puzzle adventure that makes full use of one of the most enjoyably interactive game worlds in a long time. Pros: A great concept, well executed. Excellent world and puzzle design, with secrets and revelations around every corner. Charming visuals and even the few action elements are nicely handled. Cons: Survival element and dialogue with other characters is rather undercooked and it is possible to get entirely stuck at times. Score: 8/10\n\nFormats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PC\n\nPrice: \u00a318.99\n\nPublisher: Annapurna Interactive\n\nDeveloper: Mobius Digital\n\nRelease Date: 15th May 2019\n\nAge Rating: 7\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: L.A.
