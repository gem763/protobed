There\u2019s no cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course.\n\nYou don\u2019t usually need to get medical advice unless there\u2019s a risk of a more serious problem.\n\nTo help ease your own or your child\u2019s symptoms:\n\nDrink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration . You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea \u2013 as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup. Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Science Photo Libra)\n\nTake paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains.\n\nGet plenty of rest.\n\nIf you feel like eating, eat plain foods such as soup, rice, pasta and bread .\n\nUse special rehydration drinks made from sachets bought from pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine.\n\nAdults can take antidiarrhoeal and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medication \u2013 these aren\u2019t suitable for everyone though, so you should check the medicine leaflet or ask or your pharmacist or GP for advice before trying them.\n\nBabies and young children, especially if they\u2019re less than a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated.\n\nNorovirus can spread very easily, so you should wash your hands regularly while you\u2019re ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the symptoms have cleared to reduce the risk of passing it on.\n\nHealth Advice\n\nWhen to get medical advice:\n\nYou don\u2019t normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there\u2019s no specific treatment for it. Antibiotics won\u2019t help because it\u2019s caused by a virus.\n\nVisiting your GP surgery with norovirus can put others at risk, so it\u2019s best to call your GP or NHS 111 if you\u2019re concerned or feel you need advice.\n\nGet medical advice if:\n\nYour baby or child has passed 6 or more watery stools in the past 24 hours, or has vomited 3 times or more in the past 24 hours\n\nYour baby or child is less responsive, feverish, or has pale or mottled skin\n\nYou or your child has symptoms of severe dehydration, such as persistent dizziness, only passing small amounts of urine or no urine at all, or reduced consciousness \u2013 babies and elderly people have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated\n\nYou have bloody diarrhoea\n\nYour symptoms haven\u2019t started to improve after a few days\n\nYou or your child have a serious underlying condition, such as kidney disease, and have diarrhoea and vomiting\n\nYour GP may suggest sending off a sample of your stool to a laboratory to confirm whether you have norovirus or another infection.", "description": "Rock Ferry Primary School, in Wirral, was forced to close after large numbers of children and staff fell ill", "authors": ["George Morgan", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Getty Images Science Photo Libra"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704999.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Mother-measuring-temperature-her-sick-asian-little-child-girl-with-infrared-thermometer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
