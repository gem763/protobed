They use traffic management techniques to change speed limits and improve the flow of cars.\n\nAnd by April, the smart network will cover 488 miles and an additional 300 is planned by 2025.\n\nMr O'Sullivan has rejected calls to pause the extension of the programme and more emergency laybys as he feels they would do little to improve safety.\n\nThere were 77 deaths across conventional roads, compared to just nine on smart motorways\n\nAlthough Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has allegedly requested an investigation into the motorway's 'true safety record'.\n\nJason Mercer, 44, was killed just 15 minutes after saying goodbye to his wife Claire, 43, when an 18-tonne HGV smashed into him on the M1 smart motorway.\n\nHe was the fifth person killed on the same 16 mile stretch of the M1 in just 10 months.\n\nJason Mercer, 44, was killed just 15 minutes after saying goodbye to his wife Claire, 43, when a HGV ploughed into him on the M1 smart motorway\n\nBut Mr O'Sullivan told The Times that 'we know' the network is safe as 'you lay all the numbers out' and can see the benefits.\n\nGrant Shapps, the transport secretary, has requested an investigation into the motorway's 'true safety record'\n\nIt is more a case of 'struggling to convince people' who feel conventional motorways are safer and AA have a 'duty' to communicate safe driving 'more clearly'.\n\nHe added that organisations such as the AA had a duty to communicate safe motorway driving more clearly.\n\nEdmund King, president of the AA, said: 'It\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that having more lay-bys won\u2019t improve safety . . . if drivers have more places to pull off the motorway that\u2019s going to make the whole thing a lot safer.'\n\nWork has already begun on painting lay-bys bright orange to avoid confusion on where the hard shoulder is on a smart motorway. Work will be completed in spring.", "description": "Jim O'Sullivan, chief executive of Highways England, says bad drivers are the cause of crashes on smart motorways in Britain.
