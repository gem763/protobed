Those kinds of schisms have plagued party conventions in years when a Republican incumbent went on to lose his re-election bid, Republican officials said. Mr. Trump himself confronted an effort to strip him of delegates in 2016.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s political advisers have been working for months to get states to adjust their plans to ensure that nothing disrupts next year\u2019s convention.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Annie Karni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/us/politics/02trump-delegates/merlin_110155078_760102e9-c5c4-4c48-86ac-f554f5964824-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
