Premium members will be allowed to visit Komodo island, while non-premium members will be able to visit other islands in the Komodo national park, where dragons also live.\n\nMarius Jelamu, spokesman for Mr Laiskodat, told the BBC precise details were still being worked out.\n\n\"The growth of the community on the island will be restricted so that the village does not become too big and threaten conservation efforts,\" he said.\n\n\"There will also be more education programs in the village to make sure the community are fully part of the conservation effort.\"\n\nHe added there would be tighter regulations on the movement of cruise ships.\n\nKomodo dragons are the world's largest lizards. They can grow up to 3m (10ft) long and have razor-sharp teeth and a poisonous bite.\n\nMost of them - around 1,700 - live on Komodo Island, and around 1,000 more live on Rinca, another island in the national park.\n\nThe national park as a whole is a Unesco World Heritage site.", "description": "Entry to the Indonesian island was $10, but authorities want to restrict the number of visitors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/393D/production/_109035641_komodo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
