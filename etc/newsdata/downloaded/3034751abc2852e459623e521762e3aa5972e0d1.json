In a new book, \u201cSchism,\u201d about China and global trade, Paul Blustein explains how the U.S. could join with other countries to make such a trade case based on the W.T.O. agreement. Trade experts aren\u2019t sure the case would succeed, but it\u2019s worth trying.\n\nA second step the United States should take is to invest more in internet circumvention technologies to help ordinary Chinese vault the Great Chinese Firewall and read uncensored news. The U.S. spends more than $700 million a year on broadcast programs to sometimes-obscure parts of the world, but only tiny sums to help citizens of closed countries access the free internet.\n\nRichard Stengel, a former under secretary of state who was involved in these programs, told me that he generally agreed that the U.S. should invest more in circumvention technologies. \u201cIt aligns with American values,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be in favor.\u201d\n\nSome American officials I\u2019ve spoken with worry that this would enrage Xi. Yes, it might. Frankly, it\u2019s also not clear that many Chinese want to access the outside internet, for they don\u2019t much use tools like Ultrasurf and Psiphon that already enable them to do so (with a bit of difficulty).\n\nThose are fair concerns, but I worry even more about the rise of nationalism in China inculcated in part by the Communist Party\u2019s education system and propaganda machine. I\u2019ve seen over the decades how a freer flow of information eventually can liberate minds and peoples, and the world would be better off if that process unfolded in China.", "description": "President Xi wants to censor the Western world, too.", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/opinion/09kristofWeb/09kristofWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
