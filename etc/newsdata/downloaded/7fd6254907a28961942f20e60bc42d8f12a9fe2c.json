The bubbly \u201cToday\u201d meteorologist used her skill in making abstract concepts very concrete, just weeks ago, demonstrating the change in how the sun hits the earth above and below the equator during fall months. Bringing out her handy-dandy black marker and an orange, Dylan Dreyer could have been in any elementary school classroom, teaching her lesson on weather.\n\nThis morning, October 14, Dreyer was fresh off a weekend of hosting a session at the New York Wine & Food Festival, and the resourceful mom described just what to do when a kitchen demonstration doesn\u2019t exactly go as planned. It always helps to have your three-year-old in the audience.\n\nBringing out the charm offensive\n\nLike the other professionals of the \u201cToday\u201d show and her third-hour colleagues, Dylan Dreyer knows the disaster of dead air, especially when any action is \u201clive\u201d before cameras.\n\nShe described both the honor and the bevy of activity at the esteemed food and beverage event as \u201cbananas,\u201d and by the way, bananas happen to be one of her son, Calvin\u2019s, favorite foods.\n\nDylan Dreyer was all set to prepare one of Calvin\u2019s other favorites, her homemade chicken pot pie, for her premiere food event, until the main ingredient wasn\u2019t quite ready. That's why Calvin came to his mommy\u2019s rescue.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news! Click on the topic you interest most. We'll keep you updated with all the news you shouldn't miss. TV Shows\n\nThe effervescent co-host was only into her cooking demonstration for about a minute when she noticed that the chicken in her pot was not even cooked. It seems like the New York Wine & Food Festival folks are not up to the wizardry of cooking by magic, like \u201cToday\u201d preparation staff, who make sure there is always one ready in the oven at exactly the same time that the just-mixed recipe goes into the preheated appliance.\n\nIt had to the divine providence that Dylan\u2019s husband, Brian Fichera, just happened to be watching with their son, Calvin, 3. Dylan called her preschooler up to the kitchen stage, and he could not have been more precious. He may not possess the slice and dice skills of the professional chefs just yet, but he certainly showed off personality as he played with bowls, worked the dishtowel for cleanup, and even tasted a spoonful for Mom.\n\nThe audience didn\u2019t show one bit of dissatisfaction at seeing the featured cooking star become a duo, and Dylan Dreyer's session still came off as a hit after the other 29 minutes.\n\nAlways up for a taste test\n\nCalvin didn\u2019t make one disdainful face after tasting anything at his big stage debut in cooking, but Dylan Dreyer has frequently shared the fun of seeing her son try all manner of food and drink through his young years.\n\nOf course, he'll have to wait several more years before he is eligible to offer his review on wines, but he has already weighed in on seltzer water, his first apple, and chocolate goodies. The growing boy has also teamed up for swim safety lessons with his mom.\n\nHarry Smith was sitting in for Al Roker, and the veteran broadcaster couldn't get enough of Dylan Dreyer\u2019s pot pie. She calls the dish her \u201cgo-to meal\u201d for the weekend or a weekday night, and loves that it gets \u201call the veggies in there\u201d for Calvin. She confirmed to Smith that her boy really does eat the vegetables, the chicken, and the puff pastry crust.\n\nDylan Dreyer has mentioned in the past that Calvin would rather watch Elmo on TV than her, but if he ever wants to have his own cooking show (or take the \u201cToday\u201d kitchen), he seems to already know the ropes and the spoons, too.", "description": "The busy co-host and meteorologist, on the morning show, proves how entertaining a three-year-old can be in the kitchen.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Jane Flowers", "Susan B.", "Read More On The Same Topic Tresa Patterson", "Hawaii Five-O", "Season Episode", "Cullen'S Surprise Croissants", "A Plane Crash Perp", "Today S", "Craig Melvin Is A Nice Dad"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/14/os/b_1200x630/dylan-dreyer-of-today-had-help-from-her-son-calvin-at-the-new-york-wine-food-festival-image-source-today-youtube_2339229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
