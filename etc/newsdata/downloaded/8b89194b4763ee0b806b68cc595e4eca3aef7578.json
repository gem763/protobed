I don't know why she [the head teacher] hasn't said anything to me in person.'\n\nStacy Jarvis, 31, of East Hull, is pictured with her nine-year-old son Jayden\n\nMiss Jarvis said she would not have been so upset by the whole situation if she had known her son was offered a hot meal, before being offered a tuna sandwich.\n\nShe was so infuriated she pulled her son out of school over the issue, but sent him back a day later after being threatened with a fine for unauthorised absence.\n\nShe then spoke to the headteacher on the phone once Jayden had gone back to school last Friday to ask for assurances for the future.\n\nBut in her letter, the Mrs Machon accused Miss Jarvis of only speaking to her on the phone to get 'enough information' to pass onto the media.\n\nThe head wrote in the letter: 'I went out of my way on Friday, during our telephone conversation, so that we could move forward and out the incident behind us, to ensure the best for Jayden.\n\n'It has now become apparent that the sole purpose of the conversation was so that you could gain enough information for a follow up newspaper report. Once again completely based on untruths and misquotes.'\n\nMiss Jarvis said she 'does not know what to do now.'\n\nJayden is pictured with siblings Alisha, seven and Cole, five\n\nShe said: 'That was not the case. I wanted to talk to her to resolve it. I'm fuming about that because that wasn't the fact.'\n\nThe letter tells Miss Jarvis her actions have caused a great deal of stress and upset to all the staff at the school.\n\nThe headteacher signs off the letter by telling Miss Jarvis she will continue to do her best for 'all of her children.'\n\nBut she warns her she will be banned from the school site if she is 'rude' and 'aggressive' again.\n\nIn a statement school head Mrs Machon said: 'Thanet school promotes five key values of respect, responsibility, kindness, honesty and friendship. I have written to Miss Jarvis to request she adheres to these values.'", "description": "Stacy Jarvis publicly accused staff at Thanet Primary School in East Hull of leaving her nine-year-old Jayden starving with no food for the entire day.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19842102-0-image-a-64_1571322193778.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
