There is \u201cno immediate plan to conduct a procurement exercise of a similar nature.\u201d\n\nA copy of the government brief seeking PR services underlines that city authorities are aware the political unrest has \u201craised concerns about Hong Kong\u2019s positioning as a global business and financial hub with a stable environment underpinned by the rule of law\".\n\nThe goal in procuring public relations services was to \u201caddress negative perceptions in key markets overseas to maintain confidence in Hong Kong [and to] underscore the strengths and attributes that differentiate Hong Kong from other cities in the region and bring out the success of \u2018one country, two systems,\" reads the brief obtained by the Holmes Report, a PR trade publication.\n\nViolent, long-running protests have damaged Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as an efficient global financial centre and popular tourist destination.\n\nActivists first took to the streets against a proposal that would allow people facing criminal charges to be extradited to China, where the ruling Communist Party controls the courts. Demands have since evolved to encompass wider freedoms, including direct leadership elections.\n\nProtesters have disrupted road and rail links, and even blocked passengers from catching flights in efforts to draw global attention to their cause.\n\nEarlier this month, Ms Lam finally conceded to one of five protest demands by formally withdrawing the extradition proposal. The government also began taking out full-page newspaper ads overseas including in the Australian Financial Review and the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cYou have read a lot, seen a lot, heard a lot about the events and protests in Hong Kong,\u201d the ads said. \u201cBut what you read, see, hear or \u2018share\u2019 on social media is just one piece of a complex social, economic and political jigsaw puzzle. It is a puzzle that we will solve on our own. And, it may take time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe remain a safe open, welcoming and cosmopolitan society and an internationally connected, vibrant and dynamic economy,\u201d the ad said. \u201cWe will no doubt bounce back. We always do.\u201d\n\nBut many activists say Ms Lam\u2019s move was too little, too late.\n\nIndeed, the damage is clear from the numbers \u2013 tourist arrivals in August plummeted 40% compared to the same period last year.\n\nThe Hong Kong International Airport, normally one of the world\u2019s busiest transport hubs, suffered its biggest monthly drop in passengers in a decade, handling 12 percent fewer in August.\n\nThe Hong Kong Tennis Open, originally scheduled for October, was also postponed to an undeclared future date.\n\nPR firm Brunswick declined to comment and Ruder Finn did not respond to queries from the Telegraph. Ogilvy said it was invited to submit a proposal and attended a briefing, but \u201cchose not to proceed after an assessment regarding the availability of our internal resources to meet required timelines.\u201d", "description": "The Hong Kong government is on its own to fix a\u00a0battered reputation\u00a0after global public relations firms declined to help with rebranding efforts as\u00a0months of pro-democracy protests have plunged\u00a0the city into its most serious political crisis ever.
