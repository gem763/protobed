The engines are in perfect condition, so that 12 aircraft have returned to regular flight operations,\" Swiss said in a statement, adding that an additional five should be cleared to fly later on Wednesday.\n\nThe grounding of the Swiss fleet came after Airbus A220s -- initially known as the Bombardier C Series - were involved in eight separate engine-linked incidents in just over a year, according to Swiss public broadcaster RTS, which cited the Aviation Herald.\n\n\n\nThe latest came on Tuesday, when a Swiss flight from London to Geneva was rerouted to Paris after an incident that raised questions about the engine on the model.\n\nFrance's investigation and analysis bureau BEA has also sent out a call for volunteers to help find pieces of an engine dropped by a Swiss-flown Airbus A220 over Yonne in July.\n\nAnd the Federal Aviation Administration in the US last month issued a so-called \"Airworthiness Directive\" requiring inspections of the Pratt & Whitney engines that equip the A220 following the event in July and a similar incident in September.\n\n\"Swiss takes these incidents very seriously and continues to maintain close contact with the responsible authorities,\" the company said.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
