It has been welcomed by the EU as a positive step \u2014 but leaders have been quick to highlight problems.\n\nThe biggest difference is that the controversial Irish backstop \u2014 to guarantee an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland \u2014 is scrapped.\n\nThe backstop \u2014 contained in the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the May government but rejected by the British parliament \u2014 would keep the UK in a temporary customs union, if no free trade deal or alternative plan had been agreed by the end of a post-Brexit transition period.\n\nHere is a look at some of the main proposals in the UK plan \u2014 and why they risk causing a headache for the European Union.\n\nRead more: Tusk 'unconvinced' by Brexit plan: How Europe reacted to UK proposals\n\nCustoms union: Northern Ireland to leave\n\nThe UK wants to leave the EU\u2019s customs union in 2021, after a planned transition period, to pursue an independent trade policy. The plan makes it clear that Northern Ireland, as an integral part of the UK, would leave too.\n\nBoris Johnson acknowledges that this means checks would be inevitable, but insists they would not jeopardise the open border between north and south. The EU opposes customs checks on the island of Ireland, which Brussels and Dublin say risk disrupting the all-island economy and may pose a threat to peace.\n\nThe prime minister says there would be \u201cno new physical infrastructure\u201d at the border. The EU has always been sceptical about this. It argues that no other customs border in the world is check-free, and fears that a porous frontier would be a smugglers\u2019 charter.\n\nTo deal with tariffs and rules of origin, the UK proposes trusted trader schemes and simplified procedures. Checks would be minimal and take place away from the border at business premises or at \u201cother designated locations\u201d. The plan relies heavily on technology such as satellite tracking.\n\nThe EU has repeatedly rejected such \u201calternative arrangements\u201d put forward by Eurosceptics, arguing that the technology either does not exist or is untested \u2014 and in any case would not provide an equivalent cast-iron guarantee to the backstop.\n\nThe Johnson plan demands exemptions for smaller businesses, which may require the EU to change its customs rules.\n\nRead more:'Very little time': Read Johnson's letter to EU chief Juncker on latest Brexit plan\n\nSingle market: Northern Ireland to remain (partially)\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s plan envisages Northern Ireland staying subject to EU single market rules for agriculture, food and manufactured goods. This would mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea, with checks on items coming from Britain. Such checks already happen with animals.\n\nThis goes further than his original proposal, which was for regulatory alignment with the EU only on agri-food standards. It has been welcomed by EU officials.\n\nConsent: Northern Ireland to decide\n\nHowever, the single market arrangements would have to be reviewed by Belfast. The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly would then have to decide every four years whether to continue following EU rules, or opt into British regulations.\n\nThe EU\u2019s fear is that if Stormont chose the latter course, this would bring a hard border as new customs and regulatory checks would be needed.\n\nThe plan also poses a political problem, given the delicate balance between nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing arrangements. Dublin fears that it would hand the hardline Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) an effective veto.\n\nAlso, doubt is cast on the proposal by the fact that the Stormont assembly has not sat since early 2017 due to political deadlock.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat is the Irish backstop and why does Boris Johnson want it ditched?\n\nNorthern Ireland conflict 50 years on: will a no-deal Brexit threaten the peace?\n\nCan the Johnson plan survive?\n\nEU officials are relieved that the UK prime minister has not presented the plan as a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d offer, as Downing Street had threatened he would.\n\nBrussels sees it as a starting point for further negotiation, even though Boris Johnson has said the only alternative is \u201cno deal\u201d and the obstacles to overcome are formidable.\n\nThe British government has called on the European Union to compromise. But the EU says London\u2019s proposals must be realistic and legally enforceable.\n\nPolitics will undoubtedly come into play. The EU does not want a no-deal Brexit, and certainly does not want to be seen as being responsible for such a scenario.\n\nHowever, its credibility especially with smaller states would be hugely damaged if it sacrificed Irish concerns to bend the rules and secure a deal with the UK.\n\nThe EU's priority is to preserve its cohesion, along with the integrity of its single market, institutions and founding principles \u2014 as well as upholding peace and security on the island of Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat was in Theresa May's Brexit deal and why was it rejected?\n\nNo-deal Brexit: everything you need to know\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?\n\nWant more news?", "description": "EU leaders are reserving full judgement on the UK prime minister\u2019s plan, but critics say it crosses several red lines.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/47/46/1000x563_cmsv2_c873d4b1-04d2-5a59-a2a9-8e6db7acbe03-4204746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
