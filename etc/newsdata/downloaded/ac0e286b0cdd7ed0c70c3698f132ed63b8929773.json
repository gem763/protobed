Irvin believes the Dallas Cowboys should look into signing Brown, even if it\u2019s just a temporary fix, according to 105.3 The Fan.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nWhen asked about the Cowboys\u2019 recent struggles, Irvin suggested the team needed \u201creal help.\u201d With wideout Amari Cooper sidelined due to an injury, Irvin went so far as to suggest Dallas sign Brown as a replacement.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIrvin wasn\u2019t sold on that stance initially. He asked the hosts what they thought about bringing in Brown. Ultimately, Irvin came to the conclusion that it\u2019s worth signing Brown for \u201ca week or two,\u201d according to Sports Illustrated.\n\n\"Where we find help?'' Irvin said, \"I don't care. I don't care about media relations or a public-relations nightmare.'' And then the Hall of Fame receiver paused, gathering and re-analyzing his own thoughts. \"Maybe,'' Irvin summarized, \"we should just go pick him up for a week or two.''\n\nThe 31-year-old Brown hasn\u2019t played in the NFL since he was released by the New England Patriots in September. The team released Brown after he was accused of rape. Since then, Brown has also been accused of sexual misconduct, as well as \u201creprehensible behavior\u201d during a deposition, among many other things. When Brown was released by the Patriots, the NFL sent out a memo suggesting Brown would face a suspension if another team signed him.\n\nAfter starting the season 3-0, the Cowboys have lost three straight games. During Sunday\u2019s loss against the New York Jets, the team lost Cooper to an injury on Dallas\u2019 first drive. The Cowboys\u2019 offense looked lifeless without Cooper, and it\u2019s unclear whether the receiver will be able to return for Week 7.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite those offensive struggles, there\u2019s no evidence the Cowboys are considering Brown. Irvin might think it\u2019s a good idea, but the team isn\u2019t that desperate for talent just yet.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
