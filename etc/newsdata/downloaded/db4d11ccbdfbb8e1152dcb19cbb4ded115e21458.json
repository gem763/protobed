Previously they had penciled in growth to be \u2018around\u2019 2.5% for 2019; currently, the average growth for 2019 is just 1.6%, both way below their forecast and trend. Moreover, with annualized growth at just 1.4%, GDP is its lowest since Q3 2009 and clearly beneath trend. Whilst markets are pricing in the potential for a cut this year; they\u2019re still not confident of a cut at their next meeting. That said, expectations for a cut would likely be brought forward if employment data disappoints on the 19th of September.\n\nAUD/USD Daily Chart\n\nFor now, AUD/USD is enjoying its corrective rebound and hit a 6-day high simply because GDP hit expectations. Moreover, the USD rally has hit a speed bump following yesterday\u2019s ISM contraction, which is allowing the Aussie a little more headroom.\n\nYesterday\u2019s bullish outside day suggests an interim low could be in place, and intraday bulls could seek long positions towards 0.6832 resistance.\n\nFor now, we favor current price action to be corrective against the bearish trend and possible part of a flat correction (between 0.6677 and 0.6832)\n\nThis could allow bears to fade into moves below 0.6832 on the daily chart. A momentum shift around these levels (i.e., a strong rejection of the level) suggests the correction is over, and AUD/USD could head for a break to new lows\n\nGBP/AUD Daily Chart\n\nBrexit woes continue to weaken the British pound overall, yet headline risks remain for both directions. That said, the daily structure on GBP/AUD suggests we\u2019ve seen the end of a correction and could be headed back towards the 1.7562 low (and possibly lower if the trend holds.\n\nThe daily trend remains bearish below 1.8336, although the break of its correction line suggests it's ready to resume its downtrend\n\n1.8000 is a pivotal level, being a round number and having acted as support and resistance previously, so we\u2019d seek bearish setups beneath this 1.8000\n\nThis could allow bears to fade into intraday rallies below 1.8000, or wait for a break of yesterday\u2019s low before assuming trend continuation.\n\nOne caveat with the broken correction line is that we\u2019ve not seen a daily close beneath it, even though current prices are below it, so, one could use a daily close as added confirmation it has broken out.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
