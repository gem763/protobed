Asylum is protection granted to people already in the U.S., while refugees are those requesting protections from outside the country.\n\nThere\u2019s already a backlog of nearly 1 million asylum cases pending with Homeland Security and the immigration courts.\n\nA senior administration official said they view asylum and the refugee program in tandem, and as the number of migrants demanding asylum on the southwest border has surged, it\u2019s natural that the government would cut the number of refugees it can handle.\n\n\u201cGiven the massive backlog we\u2019ve got in humanitarian protection cases that are already in our country, it makes sense to prioritize that case load before we go abroad looking for new refugees to resettle,\u201d the official told The Washington Times.\n\nAs striking as the smaller refugee cap is, officials said the changes to the system are just as important.\n\nChief among those is an executive order Mr. Trump will soon issue giving states and localities the chance to consent before refugees are sent to their jurisdictions.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue a number of regions raised several years back when the Obama administration was inviting refugees from the war-torn terrorism hotbed of Syria.\n\nThe administration says refugees, who are entitled to taxpayer programs such as Medicaid, and who often come with children who have special education needs, can tax localities. It makes sense to give them a chance to say whether they can accommodate new arrivals.\n\n\u201cThe aim behind this is setting people up for success,\u201d the administration official told The Times. \u201cSome states and localities aren\u2019t ready for this. Others are.\u201d\n\nThe administration will also change the way the refugee cap is allocated. In the past, each region of the globe had a limit, which served to spread refugees around different regions.\n\nBut Trump officials say those geographic divisions didn\u2019t align with the law, which says the U.S should prioritize important cases.\n\nInstead, they will divide the 18,000 refugees into interest categories, with 5,000 slots designated for religious minorities, 4,000 slots for Iraqis who have assisted the U.S., and 1,500 refugees from Central America\u2019s Northern Triangle region.\n\nThose countries \u2014 Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2014 account for almost all of the border asylum surge, and the administration hopes that carving out a set number of refugee slots will help separate valid claims from the mostly bogus cases coming through the asylum system.\n\n\u201cThe idea is if we can find them, we can give them an alternative to having to make the dangerous trip here,\u201d the administration official said.\n\nThe new policy will also reduce the role of the U.N., which traditionally has played gatekeeper in vetting and suggesting potential refugees to the U.S.\n\nOfficials said the administration will still rely on the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to suggest valid Northern Triangle refugees, and the UNHCR will also be able to flag potential applicants in other categories.\n\nBut religious minorities and Iraqis can apply directly to the U.S. under existing laws, undercutting the U.N.\u2019s role in selecting names of potential newcomers.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly we don\u2019t need to ask them for any. We\u2019ve got thousands of people in the processing backlog,\u201d the official said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
