It was awful for me personally but was a lot worse for my wife.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cI was more concerned at the fact that we were told there were no beds, yet my wife had been in labour for two days.\n\n\"What would have happened if it had got to the stage that the baby was coming? What would they have done then?\n\n\u201cWe were sitting in a room on a hard chair and there was no contact - nothing.\u201d\n\nThe couple say they were given a bed around 1.30am on Friday morning.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/Tetra images RF)\n\nThe couple said that they were left with little pain relief, with the mother only given paracetamol to deal with the pain of childbirth.\n\nHer partner added: \u201cTo be honest, I find it a joke. That\u2019s the truth.\n\n\u201cWhen you have got a hospital sitting there in Wick and you can\u2019t use it then what is the point?\u201d\n\nAn NHS Highland spokesman apologised for the situation not being up to the \u201cexpected standard\u201d and encouraged the couple to contact the health authority\u2019s lead midwife to investigate their concerns.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nThe couple has since raised concerns with the Caithness Health Action Team (Chat), who claimed this was not an isolated report of mothers who have had to give birth at Raigmore.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are growing increasingly concerned about the capacity for Caithness mothers to give birth at Raigmore following the downgrading of the maternity model here in Caithness.\n\n\u201cMothers have told us there is a lack of privacy and yet again this highlights the plight of health services to the people of Caithness.\n\n\u201cIt is by time something changed and we will continue to push for those changes.\u201d", "description": "The Scottish couple say they had to drive from their home in Wick to a hospital in Inverness due to a lack of local beds", "authors": ["John Jeffay", "Sam Elliott", "Image", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Cultura Rf", "Getty", "Getty Images Tetra Images Rf"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706911.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pregnant-woman-at-hospital.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
