Here's everything we know about the candidate and how he stacks up against the competition", "language": "en", "text": "Who is Bill Weld?\n\nCurrent job: Candidate for the president of the US in the Republican primary.\n\nAge: 73.\n\nFamily: Weld is married to Leslie Marshall, an author and journalist. With his previous wife, Weld has five children.\n\nHometown: Smithtown, New York.\n\nPolitical party: Republican (2019-present); Libertarian (2016-2019); Republican (before 2016).\n\nPrevious jobs: Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee (2016); Governor of Massachusetts (1991-1997); Assistant attorney general for US Criminal Division (1986-1988); United States Attorney for Massachusetts (1981-1986).\n\nCould Bill Weld win the nomination?\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it, but the reality is that Weld is probably not going to be the Republican nominee for the presidency in 2020.\n\nIn general, as leader of the Republican Party a candidate like Trump has considerable home-field advantage when it comes to orchestrating the primary process, and the presidency offers unparalleled awareness numbers that Weld will not share.\n\nThere is an appeal among some Republicans for a challenger to Trump. INSIDER conducted a national SurveyMonkey Audience poll in late April that asked Republicans \"What best describes your view about the prospects for a Republican primary in 2020?\"\n\nAmong respondents who identified as at least slightly conservative, 13% said, \"I would absolutely support a qualified candidate who challenged President Trump in the Republican primary,\" 11% said, \"I would probably support a qualified Republican candidate who challenged President Trump in the primary,\" and 18% said, \"I support the president, however I am open to other qualified Republican primary challengers.\"\n\nPotentially, Weld could tap into that 42%. More likely, he won't be able to leverage that into a winning constituency.\n\nWhat are Bill Weld's political positions?", "description": "Weld was a two-term governor of Massachusetts and is the first Republican to attempt a primary challenge against President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Joe Perticone", "Joseph Zeballos-Roig"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d84eaf82e22af5f0c577ac2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
