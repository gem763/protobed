Located on the capital's south side, it was built in less than five years at a cost of 120 billion yuan ($17 billion).\n\nThe airline's first commercial flight, a China Southern Airlines plane bound for the southern province of Guangdong, took off Wednesday afternoon, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Six more flights took off later for Shanghai and other destinations.\n\nThe main Beijing airport, located in the city's northeast, is the world's second-busiest after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and is nearing capacity.\n\nDaxing, designed by the late Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid, includes a terminal billed as the world's biggest at 1 million square meters (11 million square feet).\n\nDespite that, its builders say travelers will need to walk no more than 600 meters (2,000 feet) to reach any boarding gate.\n\nThe vast, star-shaped airport is about 45 kilometers (30 miles) south of downtown Beijing. It has four runways, with plans for as many as three more.\n\nCarriers including British Airways and state-owned China Southern, the country's biggest airline by passengers, plan to move to Daxing from Beijing Capital International Airport.\n\nThe capital has a third airport, Nanyuan, for domestic flights, but the government says that will close once Daxing is in operation.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
