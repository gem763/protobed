It turned out to be powdered milk.", "language": "en", "text": "When they finally caught up to Gregg and demanded to search his backpack, they found a large clear plastic bag of white powder stuffed in a coffee can.\n\nPolice concluded that the substance was cocaine and charged Gregg with a felony. Last week, after spending nearly two months in jail, the 29-year-old pleaded guilty to cocaine possession with the intent to distribute, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. But on Thursday, just two days after learning his fate, Gregg was back in court, this time to withdraw his guilty plea. The lab tests had come back, and they showed that the suspicious-looking white substance was powdered milk, the Oklahoman reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the paper, Gregg told the judge that he got the milk from a food pantry. He said that he entered a guilty plea only so that he could stop languishing in Oklahoma County Jail, which has been plagued with issues including overcrowding, chronic mold and an unusually high suicide rate for decades.\n\nOn Friday, the case was dismissed and Gregg was released.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Police Department couldn\u2019t immediately be reached late Tuesday to clarify how powdered milk was mistaken for a stash of illegal drugs. In the probable cause affidavit obtained by the Oklahoman, an officer wrote that the baggie contained \u201ca large amount of white powder substance that I believed to be cocaine based on my training and experience,\u201d and that the powder \u201clater tested positive for cocaine and was a total package weight of 45.91 grams of cocaine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that a harmless household staple has been incorrectly categorized as an illicit drug. In 2016, the New York Times magazine and ProPublica revealed that tens of thousands of people nationwide were being jailed each year based on the results of finicky roadside drug tests that frequently produced false positives. Often, the tests were responding to environmental factors like the weather, or the presence of chemicals found in household cleaners. In some instances, police simply didn\u2019t understand how to use them correctly.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Radley Balko wrote last year, the list of innocent items that have been misidentified as dangerous drugs includes chocolate chip cookies, breath mints and the glaze from a Krispy Kreme doughnut. Despite growing awareness that the tests have a high error rate \u2014 some studies have found that they result in false positives a fifth or even a third of the time \u2014 many police departments continue to rely on them.\n\nAt the time of his Aug. 12 arrest, Gregg was on probation. Court records show that the 29-year-old had been arrested on drug-related charges at least three times since 2014, and had previously pleaded guilty to possessing marijuana, methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia. In at least one instance, the costs of his incarceration were waived because of mental illness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter cops found the white powder, Gregg was charged with trafficking illegal drugs and jailed on a $50,000 bond. He initially pleaded not guilty, but after nearly two months in jail, he changed his mind. On Oct. 8, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute.\n\nThat day, Gregg was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nThough he was released just days later when his public defender pointed out the new evidence that had emerged, showing that the white powder tested negative for cocaine, many on social media argued that Gregg\u2019s ordeal illustrated a larger problem with the criminal justice system.\n\nAD\n\nRather than spend months or even years in jail while awaiting a trial, people who can\u2019t afford to pay bail often end up reluctantly pleading guilty to crimes they did not commit. The National Registry of Exonerations has found that 66 percent of people who were exonerated after being convicted of drug crimes ended up in prison in the first place because they entered a guilty plea. Similarly, the 2016 New York Times-ProPublica investigation found that more than half of the people charged with drug crimes on the basis of a faulty field test pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.\n\n\u201cInnocent people plea guilty. A lot,\u201d tweeted Jason Lollman, a public defender in Tulsa, who added that Oklahoma County Jail is \u201cwidely considered one of the worst in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny innocent person would consider pleading guilty just to get out,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD", "description": "Cody Gregg was arrested after police stopped him for riding a bicycle with no rear lights and searched his backpack.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ckgkm4j7Z5Sput_ScnASfhynfmI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LBDDZE7R7REC3NH7LRRBSFAJOM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
