A system's computing power increases exponentially with each additional qubit.\n\nYes, but: IBM scientists, who are also developing quantum machines, recently argued that Google's team underestimated the power of current computers.\n\nIBM scientists claim that a modern computer system could perform the calculation in Google\u2019s report in 2.5 days, and it would make fewer mistakes than Google's quantum machine.\n\nOf note: There's debate over the utility of quantum random number generation \u2014 the task Google's machine completed. However, Google says it's important for next-generation cryptography.\n\nGo deeper: Heading off the quantum encryption apocalypse", "description": "Tasks that take current computers 10,000 years could be completed by quantum machines in minutes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/VR8a-YkmJNSBfCLdUprgsatz1I0=/0x311:5050x3152/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571848782311.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
