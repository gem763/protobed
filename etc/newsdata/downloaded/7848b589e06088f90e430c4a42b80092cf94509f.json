This article is adapted from a forthcoming report, entitled \u201cThe Rise of the \u2018Traditionalist International\u2019: How Moscow cultivates American white nationalists, domestic secessionists, and the Religious Right,\u201d from People For the American Way.\n\n\n\nUntil the election of Donald Trump, no sitting president had ever requested a foreign government\u2019s help to discredit a political rival. Coupled with Trump\u2019s appeal to Russia during the 2016 campaign that Moscow use its cyber power to uncover Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails, not to mention his eldest son\u2019s eagerness to accept anti-Clinton material from Kremlin allies, Trump\u2019s willingness to allow foreign governments to influence American elections is historically unprecedented.\n\nJust how unprecedented becomes clear when you look back at the long history of attempts by foreign powers (almost always Russia) to tip an outcome to their advantage. On multiple occasions since the start of the Cold War, Moscow has proffered money, dirt and manpower to undermine a candidate perceived to be harmful to their interests. But in nearly every instance, the interference never came to pass. And this is the starkest difference between Trump and other presidential candidates\u2014and between Trump and every one of his presidential predecessors. Where Trump has welcomed such assistance\u2014and, in the case of his controversial call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, demanded it\u2014other candidates, to a man, rejected the aid.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat these examples show is that across parties and across decades\u2014whether or not there were laws in place banning the foreign aid\u2014aspirants to the nation\u2019s highest office recognized the impropriety of the offers. Even as they knew how valuable it might be to them, especially as challengers, they understood that accepting the assistance would compromise them and the underpinnings of American democracy, should they win.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any precedent for this kind of prima facie corrupt action on the part of an American president,\u201d Brad Simpson, an associate history professor at the University of Connecticut with a focus on U.S. foreign policy, said. \u201cI think that [this is] a president whose whole political life has been prone to conspiracy theories, but who now has the apparatus of the executive branch to try and do something about it\u2014and that\u2019s what\u2019s really novel.\u201d\n\nOr as Dov Levin, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong and renowned expert on American interference efforts, told me. \u201cFor a sitting president to do that, if it\u2019s confirmed, would be something which is new, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nWe have known for decades that when it comes to foreign interference efforts, campaigns are the front-line\u2014the first targeted, and the first to know. And for decades, the campaigns\u2019 refusals have stopped interference efforts in their tracks. As we already know, hostile regimes such as Russia successfully injected themselves into the 2016 election\u2014without asking permission\u2014coaxing armed white supremacists onto the street, stealing internal emails and planting fake news stories, and creating some of the most popular social media feeds during the election. And Russia is almost certainly gaming out how to reprise its efforts in 2020. The difference now is that the interference, after decades, has been sanctioned by the president himself.\n\n\n\n***\n\nFor most of U.S. history, other countries have largely resisted the impulse to meddle in our affairs, both out of indifference and a desire not to get on the wrong side of the other political party. There were a handful of examples in our republic\u2019s early days\u2014in 1796, in 1812\u2014of American officials reaching out to British or French counterparts to try to coax them into interfering in upcoming elections. (The historical record doesn\u2019t make it clear exactly which Americans these were, but none, obviously, were sitting presidents.) But those requests for foreign help went nowhere, and for decades afterward, European governments paid little thought to helping, say, Ulysses S. Grant or Grover Cleveland earn a second term in office.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after World War II that these interference efforts, driven by foreign capitals, began in earnest. By then, America\u2019s role on the global stage had never been greater. And its primary adversary, led by a paranoid clique sitting in the Kremlin, began probing for weaknesses in America\u2019s electoral defenses, and began looking for American candidates willing to brook foreign interference.\n\nHenry Wallace, commerce secretary under Harry Truman, was the first candidate Moscow targeted for support, back in 1948. Broadly sympathetic to Soviet designs, Wallace set the tone for his pro-Soviet views early. \u201cThe first thing we have evidence for is, in Oct. 1945, when he was still the secretary of commerce, Wallace contacted the NKVD [the forerunner to the KGB] station chief in Washington, basically telling him that the people who support him are fighting for Truman\u2019s soul, and that other people in the Truman administration are more anti-Soviet,\u201d Levin said. \u201cHe basically asked, \u2018Come and help me\u2014I\u2019ll be an agent of influence to make sure there will be better policies.\u2019 He basically believed that [Joseph] Stalin and the Soviets had benign intentions.\u201d\n\nWallace carried those beliefs into the 1948 election, as the head of the third-party Progressive Party. A clear longshot\u2014think of his run as something closer to Jill Stein, rather than Donald Trump\u2014Wallace made rapprochement with the USSR a key plank. A few months before the election, Wallace thundered in New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden about the need to decrease tensions between Moscow and Washington. And he immediately got a public show of support from the man presiding over the Soviet Union\u2019s efforts at ethnic cleansing, totalitarian designs, and destruction of nascent democracies across Eastern Europe: Stalin.\n\nStalin wrote a letter, published in newspapers across the U.S., that was straightforward. Wallace\u2019s call for easing tension was the \u201cmost important\u201d political platform \u201cof recent times,\u201d the Soviet dictator wrote. \u201cAs far as the government of the USSR is concerned, we believe that the program of Wallace could be a good and fruitful foundation for such understanding and for the development of international cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe Soviet tyrant\u2019s praise immediately reverberated. \u201cIt was a big commotion,\u201d Levin said. \u201c[Stalin\u2019s letter] dominated news for a whole month, with some people hoping it would end the Cold War before it started.\u201d More pertinently, Wallace wasn\u2019t surprised to receive the show of support; thanks to back channels between Wallace\u2019s supporters, members of the U.S. Communist Party, and Soviet partners, \u201cStalin had let him know ahead of time\u201d that the letter was in the works, Levin added.\n\nThe missive didn\u2019t do much for Wallace\u2019s chances; the former commerce secretary\u2019s campaign barely registered during the 1948 election and failed to carry a single state. But to Moscow, that didn\u2019t necessarily matter. The seed of interfering in American elections was planted\u2014a plan that, over the coming decades, would try to take root time and again, but only succeed once Donald Trump announced his campaign for the presidency.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn 1960, with the Cold War in full bloom, the Soviet ambassador, Mikhail Menshikov, arranged a sit-down meeting with perennial Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson. According to Stevenson\u2019s recollections, Menshikov got right to the point, pulling a slip of paper from his pocket with a message from Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned with the future, and that America has the right President,\u201d Menshikov dictated. \u201cAll countries are concerned with the American election. It is impossible for us not to be concerned about our future and the American Presidency which is so important to everybody everywhere.\u201d The Soviet ambassador continued, unspooling Khrushchev\u2019s offer:\n\nBecause we know the ideas of Mr. Stevenson, we in our hearts all favor him. And you Ambassador Menshikov must ask him which way we could be of assistance to those forces in the United States which favor friendly relations. We don\u2019t know how we can help to make relations better and help those to succeed in political life who wish for better relations and more confidence. Could the Soviet press assist Mr. Stevenson\u2019s personal success? How? Should the press praise him, and, if so, for what? Should it criticize him, and, if so, for what? (We can always find many things to criticize Mr. Stevenson for because he has said many harsh and critical things about the Soviet Union and Communism!) Mr. Stevenson will know best what would help him.\n\nStevenson, according to his notes, blanched. Following Menshikov\u2019s bid, Stevenson offered his thanks for \u201cthis expression of Khrushchev\u2019s confidence.\u201d But the red line Menshikov had crossed was undeniable: \u201c[I detailed my] grave misgivings about the propriety or wisdom of any interference, direct or indirect, in the American election,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cI said to him that even if I was a candidate I could not accept the assistance proffered. I believe I made it clear to him that I considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned.\u201d\n\nRejected by Stevenson, Moscow turned elsewhere. As Christopher Andrew detailed in The Sword and the Shield, his 700-page run-through of documents smuggled from former KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin, Khrushchev especially feared the election of Republican nominee and Cold War hawk Richard Nixon. (Nixon would leave a trail of ignominy not only for his eventual resignation, but also, in a nod to Trump and Russia in 2016, for his willingness as a candidate to set up back channels with South Vietnamese partners in the run-up to the 1968 election.) The KGB resident in Washington, Alexander Feklisov, received orders from the Kremlin to \u201cpropose diplomatic or propaganda initiatives, or any other measures, to facilitate [John F.] Kennedy\u2019s victory.\u201d As Feklisov added in his autobiography, his mission centered on providing ideas \u201cto Moscow that could help secure a Kennedy victory.\u201d The details on Feklisov\u2019s and Moscow\u2019s ideas remain scant\u2014yet another casualty of Moscow\u2019s unwillingness to allow access to archival material\u2014but we do know that, as part of his mission, Feklisov reached out directly to those surrounding Robert Kennedy, JFK\u2019s lead campaign surrogate. But the Kremlin again got nowhere; as Andrew wrote, Feklisov and his team\u2019s offers of help were \u201cpolitely rebuffed.\u201d\n\nNixon, of course, lost that 1960 election. But when he stood again eight years later\u2014with Leonid Brezhnev, the man whose policies of stagnation would eventually erode Soviet power, now overseeing the Kremlin\u2014Moscow espied another opportunity. As Anatoly Dobrynin, Moscow\u2019s man in Washington, detailed in his 2001 memoir, the Kremlin cooked up an idea to tilt the election once more in the Democrats\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cOur leadership [in Moscow] was growing seriously concerned that [Nixon] might win the election,\u201d Dobrynin wrote. \u201cAs a result, the top Soviet leaders took an extraordinary step, unprecedented in the history of Soviet-American relations, by secretly offering [Democratic candidate Hubert] Humphrey any conceivable help in his election campaign\u2014including financial aid.\u201d Dobrynin led the effort, breakfasting during the campaign with Humphrey himself. As the conversation wound toward the state of Humphrey\u2019s campaign\u2019s finances, the candidate quickly discerned what was on offer\u2014and immediately put a stop to it. \u201cHe knew at once what was going on,\u201d Dobrynin wrote. \u201cHe told me it was more than enough for him to have Moscow\u2019s good wishes which he highly appreciated. The matter was thus settled to our mutual relief, never to be discussed again.\u201d\n\nBut that wouldn\u2019t be the end of the Kremlin\u2019s offers of aid. With Yuri Andropov as premier in 1983\u2014the man whose untimely demise would eventually give rise to Mikhail Gorbachev and to the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself\u2014KGB leadership directed those overseeing American operations to \u201cbegin planning active measures to ensure [Ronald] Reagan\u2019s defeat in the [1984] presidential election,\u201d writes Andrew. Per the smuggled KGB archival documents, KGB agents were directed to \u201cacquire contacts on the staffs of all possible presidential candidates and in both party headquarters.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just limited to the U.S.; KGB residencies \u201coutside the United States were told to report on the possibility of sending agents to take part in this operation. [KGB leadership] made it clear that any candidate, of either party, would be preferable to Reagan.\u201d\n\nWith KGB archives from this period remaining effectively inaccessible, the details of these 1983-84 operations remain murky. (KGB residencies \u201caround the world were ordered to popularize the slogan \u2018Reagan Means War!\u2019\u201d, Andrew wrote, highlighting one of the few particulars we know about.) However, there\u2019s no evidence that any campaigns opposing Reagan ever took the bait. If anything, Andrew added, \u201cReagan\u2019s landslide victory in the 1984 election was striking evidence of the limitations of Soviet active measures within the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Soviet Union, weighed down by a crumbling economy and fractured by nationalist movements, didn\u2019t last much longer. But Moscow\u2019s presence in American elections, even during the 1990s, didn\u2019t collapse alongside the Soviet implosion. As The New York Times reported this month, a trio of Republican representatives came to President George H.W. Bush in the lead-up to the 1992 election with an idea: reaching out to the Kremlin directly for dirt on Bill Clinton, nipping his opposition campaign in the bud.\n\nBut like Stevenson, Kennedy, and Humphrey before him, Bush and his inner circle balked. \u201cThey wanted us to contact the Russians\u2026 to seek information on Bill Clinton\u2019s trip to Moscow,\u201d James A. Baker III, Bush\u2019s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo. \u201cI said we absolutely could not do that.\u201d Baker shut the conversation down, and with it any consideration of reaching out to Russia for help in tilting an American election.\n\nShortly thereafter, Clinton won, resoundingly. And he brought with him a First Lady who, a quarter-century later, would be on the receiving end of unprecedented interference efforts out of that same Kremlin\u2014and who would face an opponent in Donald Trump who had no problems accepting Moscow\u2019s offers of help, and who would become the first sitting president to toss the floodgates open, with all comers, and all interference, now welcome.\n\nThis article tagged under: Russia\n\nHistory Dept.", "description": "Until Trump, presidential candidates said no thanks to accepting illicit aid.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/66/f9/cbe93e5e46a49c304bb3b2648f46/191025-kremlin-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
