In a forceful email sent to staff on Sunday night, Craig McLean, the chief scientist of NOAA, took on anonymous members of his own organization who may have \u201cviolated NOAA\u2019s policies of scientific integrity.\u201d McLean vowed to pursue truths in a long saga involving President Trump, Hurricane Dorian, a Sharpie, a forecaster in Alabama, and an anonymous \u2014 and potentially coerced \u2014 press release.\n\nThis all started on September 1st, when President Trump tweeted that Alabama would be among the states most likely to be \u201chit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d It, in fact, was not.\n\nTwenty minutes later, the National Weather Service in Alabama tweeted its response: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d\n\nAt no point did Dorian present a risk to Alabama in the way Trump claimed it would\n\nForecasters at one point thought Dorian might make landfall in Florida, but instead the storm battered the Bahamas, and grazed much of the East Coast of North America before slamming into Nova Scotia and heading out to sea.\n\nAt no point did it present a risk to Alabama in the way Trump claimed it would. The National Weather Service forecast around the time of Trump\u2019s tweet indicated about a 5 percent chance of tropical-force winds for a small corner of Alabama, a far cry from Trump\u2019s warning that it would be \u201chit (much) harder.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Trump doubled down on the misinformation. He brandished an outdated National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been drawn on with a Sharpie to falsely extend the path of the storm further into Alabama. He repeated falsehoods about Dorian at a press conference on opioids. The White House even issued a statement from a rear admiral backing up the president.\n\nBut the body blow to the NWS came on Friday evening, when its parent agency, NOAA, issued an unsigned press release saying that it had provided information to Trump and the public \u201cthat tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\u201d The anonymous letter even scolded the Birmingham, Alabama National Weather Service for clapping back at Trump on Twitter on September 1st, saying that the tweet \u201cspoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times, the surprising press release was the result of threats from the secretary of commerce, who threatened that he would fire top officials at NOAA if they didn\u2019t fall in line with the president.\n\n\u201cIt compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information\u201d\n\nCurrent NOAA employees were furious at the press release, and acting chief scientist McLean seemed to put many of those frustrations into words on Sunday.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political,\u201d McLean said of the press release in his email. \u201cThe content of this press release is very concerning as it compromises the ability of NOAA to convey life-saving information necessary to avoid substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.\u201d\n\nThe press release from NOAA also immediately drew ire from the broader weather community and former NOAA administrators. \u201cThe anonymous and disingenuous statement NOAA tweeted out is a major breach of scientific integrity that damages the NWS and stains the agency\u2019s leadership,\u201d Kathryn Sullivan, who headed the agency under the Obama administration, told The Washington Post.\n\nMcLean, in his email, praised the NWS\u2019s forecasters who, he added, \u201cprovide the benefit of their own experience in announcing accurate forecasts accompanied by the distinction of all credible scientists \u2014 they sign their work.\u201d\n\nAccurate and trustworthy forecasts are important not only because they help prepare for the storm, they also avoid unnecessary panic in places that won\u2019t actually be threatened.\n\nMcLean wrote that he will continue to look into how his agency\u2019s Administrative Order on Scientific Integrity might have been violated. \u201cOur NOAA Scientific Integrity Policy and Code of Scientific Conduct make clear that all NOAA employees shall approach all scientific activities with honesty, objectively, and completely, without allegiance to individuals, organizations, or ideology,\u201d he said.", "description": "In a forceful email sent to staff on Sunday night, Craig McLean, the chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, took on anonymous members of his own organization who may have \"violated NOAA\u2019s policies of scientific integrity.\"", "authors": ["Justine Calma", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oAncbnm9HySSHYszNq7HQ1-_Wj0=/0x419:5854x3484/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19182048/1172258193.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
