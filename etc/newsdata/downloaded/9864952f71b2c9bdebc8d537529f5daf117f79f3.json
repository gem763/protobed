Trump has called the person, whose identity he says he does not know, a \u201cpartisan whistleblower\u201d and described the complaint as \u201cjust another political hack job.\u201d\n\nThe complaint against Trump over his repeated calls for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter was made public on Thursday morning. In it, the unnamed whistleblower cited conversations and details provided by \"more than half a dozen U.S. officials,\u201d alleging that Trump is \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\u201d\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testifies before a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the handling of the whistleblower complaint on Capitol Hill on Sept. 26. (Photo: Leah Millis/Reuters) More\n\n\u201cWho is this so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who doesn\u2019t know the correct facts,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. \u201cIs he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from. Is this all about Schiff & the Democrats again after years of being wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any reason to accuse them of disloyalty to our country or suggest they\u2019re beholden to some other country?\u201d Schiff asked Maguire.\n\n\"Sir, absolutely not,\u201d Maguire responded. \u201cI believe the whistleblower followed the steps every step of the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the whistleblower did the right thing,\u201d he added. \u201cI think he followed the law every step of the way.\"\n\nSchiff pressed Maguire on the timing of his defense of the whistleblower, asking why he didn\u2019t come forward sooner to protect him against Trump\u2019s smears.\n\n\u201cThe way this thing was blowing out, I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate for me to be making a press statement so that we counter each other every step of the way,\u201d Maguire said, stating that he\u2019d emphasized to the intelligence community his commitment to whistleblower protection.\n\n\u201cI think it was not only appropriate, but there\u2019s nothing that would have given more confidence to the workforce than to hear you publicly say no one should be calling this professional who did the right thing a hack, a traitor or anything else,\u201d Schiff said.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire defended the intelligence-community whistleblower at a congressional hearing Thursday morning, saying the still-anonymous official \u201cdid the right thing.\u201d", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i35bOkEyW6oSwRPI7YfFrQ--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/2c1324e0-e06d-11e9-aded-95d7a601c542", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
