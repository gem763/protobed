He added that the song would be coming \"SOON.\"\n\nThe tweet shows the album track listing. The song \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" is listed as having a guest artist, whose name is blacked out, but if you hit \"play\" on the Instagram post of the track list, her name is slowly revealed.\n\nIf you're wondering how Pentatonix pulled this off with the late superstar, Whitney recorded \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" in 1987 for the benefit album \"A Very Special Christmas,\" so it's likely that those vocals have been mixed with the a capella group's version of the tune.\n\nOther guests on the album include Kelly Clarkson, with whom the group toured several years ago, as well as Tori Kelly, Jennifer Hudson, Jazmine Sullivan and Maren Morris.\n\nRCA\n\nWhen \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" is released, it'll mark the second Whitney track released in 2019.\n\nA remixed version of her 1990 version on Steve Winwood's 1986 hit \"Higher Love\" is climbing the charts right now.", "description": "Sorry, all other Christmas music releases of 2019 -- you're about to get owned.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/whitney-houston-gty-jc-191018_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
