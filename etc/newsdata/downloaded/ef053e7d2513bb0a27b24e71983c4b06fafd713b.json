During a press conference Tuesday, Lam said her remarks will primarily focus on land and housing policies.\n\nShe is not expected to provide further concessions to the pro-democracy movement, which has spawned weekly skirmishes between police and protesters. As the crackdown intensifies, with police arresting more than 2,500 protesters, the black-clad demonstrators have fired back bricks, gasoline bombs and most recently, police say, an improvised explosive.\n\nThe homemade bomb was concealed in a roadside bush about a mile away from a police vehicle and was detonated remotely by a mobile phone, Suryanto Chin-chiu, superintendent of the Hong Kong police\u2019s Explosive Ordinance Disposal Bureau, said during a press conference Monday. The device was made with \u201chigh-performance explosives,\u201d he added.\n\nThe impact of Sunday\u2019s explosion was minimal with no injuries reported, but Suryanto said that the bomb-maker appeared to be familiar with chemicals and electrical devices, and \u201chas the ability to make effective explosives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tactics and explosives involved are similar to those used in terrorist attacks around the world,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe use of explosives is an escalation of violence.\u201d\n\nTang Ping-keung, a deputy police commissioner, said there was reason to believe the device targeted police officers.\n\nBut Gary Tang, an assistant professor of social science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, cautioned against drawing hasty conclusions. There is no evidence, he says, linking the device to protesters.\n\n\u201cIf the bomb is as advanced as the police described, I think very few people can make such a bomb,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a separate incident that pointed to intensifying violence Sunday, a protester slashed an officer with a \u201csharp-edged object,\u201d police say. The officer was hospitalized but is in stable condition.\n\nProtests and police have both increased their firepower as the political deadlock drags on. Earlier this month, officers shot two teenage protesters with live rounds. Both survived.\n\nIn the movement\u2019s earliest days, demonstrators armed themselves with umbrellas and makeshift shields. Now, pitched battles have become the norm, with hardline protesters saying they have been given no recourse after the government refused to respond to peaceful marches.\n\nWhat began as a public backlash to a contentious extradition bill has in the 19 weeks since broadened into a wider anti-communist movement, with demands that include fully democratic elections.\n\nWhile further demonstrations are planned for the coming weekend, there have been few calls to stage a protest to coincide with Lam\u2019s coming policy address, likely owing to the heightened security around the Legislative Council building.\n\nThe last time Lam made a political appearance, she ended up trapped inside the building long after the town hall-style dialogue ended, unwilling to leave while angry protesters encircled the premises.", "description": "The address comes just days after police say a homemade bomb was detonated for the first time", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zjRo6VNfugxko83tjPx1cA--~B/aD02ODI7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/1bbb302dcc862f2f2180338605159557", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
