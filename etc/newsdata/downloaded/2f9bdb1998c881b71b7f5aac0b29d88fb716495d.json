There are datasets with 100k realistic (but not real) faces available already.\n\n\"My guess is that we can code a nice generator for less than 100k...\"\n\nHowever, if the idea of seeing an army of robots with your face doesn\u2019t put you off, you can apply here.", "description": "An unnamed robotics firm is searching for the human face of its new robots - and will even pay the successful applicant \u00a3100,000 for the privilege", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20592810.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_group-of-robotic-businessman.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
