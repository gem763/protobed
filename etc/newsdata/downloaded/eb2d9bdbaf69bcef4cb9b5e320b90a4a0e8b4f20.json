With its pricing at $15, Ping\u2019s valuation is $1.16 billion (or $1.19 if underwriters exercise their options.)\n\nSubscribe to the Crunchbase Daily\n\nPing priced more conservatively, compared to its initial range, than some recent IPOs (looking at you, Cloudflare), likely due to its slower growth rate.\n\nPing isn\u2019t like most of the tech companies we\u2019ve seen go public recently. The company was previously a venture-backed startup with $128.3 million in total funding, according to Crunchbase. Its last venture round raised $35 million in 2014.\n\nBut the company, founded in 2002, was acquired by Vista Equity Partners in 2016 for $600 million. Rumors of an IPO have been floating around since last year. The new valuation of the company is quite the step up\u2014it\u2019s nearly twice what Vista Equity paid for Ping.\n\nThe company filed to go public last month with Goldman Sachs and Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch as underwriters.\n\nPing reported 25 percent ARR growth in 2019 and revenue of $201.6 million in 2018, up from $172.5 million in 2017. Its operating expenses also went up. The company reported operating expenses of $141 million in 2018, compared to $112.4 million in 2017.\n\nNow that the price has been set, it\u2019s all eyes on the Nasdaq tomorrow when Ping starts trading.\n\nIllustration Credit: Li-Anne Dias", "description": "", "authors": ["Sophia Kunthara"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IPO_generic_orange.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
