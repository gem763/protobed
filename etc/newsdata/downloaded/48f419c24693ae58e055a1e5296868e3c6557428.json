REUTERS/File Photos\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division chief, Makan Delrahim, acknowledged instances where officials\u2019 time \u201cis wasted on those kinds of squabbles.\u201d\n\nThe hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel was a tough one for Delrahim and Joe Simons, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, who were criticized by lawmakers for overlapping on the probes, and for other matters.\n\nReuters and others reported in June that the agencies had divided up the companies being investigated, with Justice taking Google and Apple, while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.com Inc.\n\nThe Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms. This led some industry observers to question whether the two investigations would overlap.\n\n\u201cBased on news reports, it sounds like your agencies may be pursuing monopolization investigations of the same companies,\u201d said the panel\u2019s Chairman Mike Lee. \u201cI don\u2019t think your agencies should be divvying up parts of a monopolization investigation of the same tech company.\u201d\n\nLee asked both men if the process of deciding which agency would investigate which company - formally called the clearance process - had broken down.\n\nFor the vast majority of matters, Simon said, it had not.\n\n\u201cI take that as a yes, things have broken down,\u201d said Lee.\n\n\u201cI would agree with that,\u201d Simons said.\n\nThe antitrust enforcers got no support from other Republicans on the panel.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, who has been a critic of Google, attacked the FTC for its failure to take a harder line with the tech giants, saying, \u201cWhat I see from your agency is a culture of paralysis.\u201d\n\nPROBING THE AUTOMAKERS\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the panel and a presidential candidate, also pressed Delrahim on a decision to probe four U.S. automakers for potentially breaking antitrust law over how they entered talks with California to curb emissions. The probe comes at a time when the Trump administration has battled the state on everything from immigration to census questions.\n\nKlobuchar said the effort looked like \u201cbullying.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite frankly the antitrust investigation into these automakers appears to have less to do with protecting competition than with intimidating parties that don\u2019t fall into line with the Trump administration\u2019s plan to relax emissions standards,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder questioning from Klobuchar, Delrahim repeatedly denied that there had been any contact or discussions between the White House and the Justice Department regarding the automakers or anything else related to antitrust.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with these companies individually announcing higher emission standards if they want to,\u201d said Delrahim, noting that no conclusions had been reached about the automakers.\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, pressed Delrahim about chief executives like John Legere, head of T-Mobile US Inc, who stayed at the Trump International Hotel, near the Justice Department, during some trips to Washington.\n\n\u201cMy decisions are not based on the hotel stays of any merging parties,\u201d Delrahim responded.\n\nIn June, a group of senators asked the government if the president had interfered in a review of the proposed $26 billion merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint Corp.\n\nKlobuchar and Senator Cory Booker, who is also running for president and sits on the subcommittee, signed the letter, as did Senator Elizabeth Warren, also a candidate for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe Justice Department approved the deal, but states sued to stop it.", "description": "The top U.S. antitrust regulators admitted at a congressional hearing on Tuesday that they had wasted time arguing over who would investigate which tech company, as they take on major probes of firms like Alphabet's Google for allegedly using their market power unfairly.", "authors": ["Diane Bartz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430945151&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1GH", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
