Elizabeth Warren speaks to reporters after a town hall meeting in Franconia, N.H., August 14, 2019. (Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters)\n\nDuring the Democratic debate in Detroit, Elizabeth Warren \u2014 presumably drawing upon her experience as a woman of color \u2014 accused President Trump of \u201cenvironmental racism, economic racism, criminal-justice racism, health-care racism.\u201d\n\nExpect Warren to accuse Trump of agricultural racism, transportation racism, and national-security racism soon. That\u2019s because it\u2019s extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a Democrat to win the White House unless 1) there\u2019s a large black-voter turnout and 2) that candidate receives between 85\u201395 percent of the black vote. Many of Warren\u2019s policy prescriptions \u2014 e.g., free health care for illegal aliens, abolishing private health insurance, decriminalizing illegal border crossings \u2014 have marginal appeal to black voters. The perception that she gamed the affirmative action spoils system by identifying as Native American doesn\u2019t help either. So she\u2019ll resort to the standard Democratic tactic of branding everyone and everything within a fifty foot radius of the Republican candidate as racist. Oh yes, and promising reparations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren, now considered the Democrat frontrunner, has erased the gap in overall voter support between herself and Biden. But despite improving her position somewhat among black voters, she still trails him in that category by a substantial margin. The latest Quinnipiac poll shows Warren with an anemic 19 percent support among blacks. Although that\u2019s a 9 point increase over the previous poll, she\u2019s still far behind Biden, who enjoys 40 percent support among black voters.\n\nWarren fares worse in the early primary state of South Carolina, where blacks constitute 60 percent of Democrat primary voters. A recent CNN poll shows black South Carolinians preferring Biden over Warren 45 percent to 4 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, if she\u2019s the nominee, Warren, as a Democrat, will get the majority of the black vote. Her percentage of the black vote in the 2018 Massachusetts Senate race (88 percent) was nearly identical to Hillary Clinton\u2019s percentage of the black vote in the 2016 presidential election (89 percent). But that percentage wasn\u2019t enough for Clinton to win because of tepid black turnout \u2014 an estimated 4 million fewer blacks went to the polls in 2016 than in 2012. It will be difficult for Warren to win in 2020 unless she can inspire a greater black turnout than Clinton did, particularly in battleground states. Getting 88 percent of the black vote in her home state of Massachusetts doesn\u2019t necessarily project to 88 percent of a robust black vote in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania, or Michigan. And 88 or even 90 percent probably won\u2019t be enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren\u2019s underwhelming black support is compounded by the fact that Trump\u2019s black support hasn\u2019t remained static. He received 8 percent of the black vote in 2016 (about average for GOP presidential candidates), but his approval rating among blacks today ranges between 15-34 percent. This, despite his oceanographic racism, grain elevator racism, and medical waste product racism. Apparently, black voters have been unduly distracted by the best economic conditions for blacks in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Trump raises his percentage of the black vote to 10-12 percent in 2020, he\u2019ll be reelected.", "description": "It will be difficult for Warren to win in 2020 unless she can inspire a greater black turnout than Clinton did, particularly in battleground states.", "authors": ["Peter Kirsanow", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
