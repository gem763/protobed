She was 25 years old and relatively unknown, best recognised from undistinguished roles in The Next Karate Kid and Beverly Hills 90210. She was up against the never-awarded Hollywood royal Annette Bening, who had a juicy, grandly entertaining role in the Academy\u2019s favourite film of the year, American Beauty \u2013 which just happened to win every other major category it was up for that night. Swank\u2019s film, Boys Don\u2019t Cry, was only up for two acting prizes, and even those nominations counted as hard-fought victories for a tough $2m indie on the subject of transgender hate crime, that had to make judicious edits to avoid a commercially crippling NC-17 rating.\n\nAmerican Beauty at 20: is the Oscar-winning hit worth a closer look? Read more\n\nBening had won the cliquier Screen Actors Guild award, often a harbinger of Oscar victory. Yet when Swank prevailed in what had been a tight months-long race, confidently taking the stage to accept her statuette from a happily baffled Roberto Benigni, no one was especially surprised. Because sometimes, amid the politics and strategy of awards campaign season, a certain level of performance cannot be denied \u2013 and Swank\u2019s astonishing, bone-deep portrayal of Brandon Teena, a 21-year-old Nebraskan trans man gang-raped and murdered in 1993 by several male acquaintances when his transgender identity was revealed, was such an achievement.\n\nSwank\u2019s performance entailed, of course, the kind of all-in physical commitment that tends to wow Oscar voters \u2013 though it was a transformation dependent on inside-out understanding of the character rather than prosthetics. With cropped hair and a slouchy denim-and-plaid wardrobe emphasising the androgynous beauty in her tough features, she controlled the calculated, rangy swagger in her body language to tilt Teena\u2019s masculine-feminine presence in either direction from scene to scene; her voice was similarly deepened and elasticised, its studiously maintained huskiness occasionally betrayed by spontaneous quivers and leaps when Teena\u2019s true emotions surged.\n\nSwank may not have been fully convincing as a man, but that was the point. Her Teena was inexperienced in the role himself, feeling his way through it as restless hormones rattled within him; he desperately wanted his gender to transcend performance, and Swank\u2019s own acting was attuned to the difficulties of the transition. Audiences had rarely seen a performance along these lines, at a time when gender identity crisis was mostly presented in cinema in flatter dress-up terms, as opposed to a more interior study of a soul at war with a body. The Academy certainly hadn\u2019t: awarding a supporting actress Oscar to Linda Hunt, adept but essentially stunt-cast in the role of a cisgender male Chinese photographer in The Year of Living Dangerously was as adventurous as they had previously been in the gender-confusion department. (The yellowface nature of the role, meanwhile, didn\u2019t exactly make it a progressive milestone.)\n\nThe mainstream media conversation around transgender representation was, to say the least, a lot less evolved in 1999 than it was in 2019 \u2013 so much less so, in fact, that Swank using male pronouns to pay tribute to Teena in her acceptance speech actually sparked a flurry of public debate. (Teena\u2019s mother JoAnn was unimpressed, insisting her child \u201cpretended she was a man so no other man could touch her\u201d.) Reports circulated of uncomfortable laughter and jeering at the film\u2019s love scenes: the Chicago critic Nick Davis recalls that even Teena\u2019s final rape and murder met with mirth at his youth-populated campus screening. Pierce\u2019s film was uncompromising in its presentation of transgender identity as difficult, untidy, as internally confusing to the person inside the body as those outside of it. Swank\u2019s performance was haunting in its self-alienation, and occasionally euphoric in its palpable sense of discovery \u2013 the actor\u2019s, one sensed, as much as the character\u2019s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hilary Swank winning the best actress Oscar in 2000.\n\nPhotograph: Gary Hershorn/Reuters\n\nYou need only compare Boys Don\u2019t Cry to a more recent Oscar winner, Tom Hooper\u2019s vapidly prettified The Danish Girl \u2013 in which Eddie Redmayne\u2019s preening transgender artist Lili Elbe appears to find her identity through the simple thrill of rolling on a pair of stockings \u2013 to see how relatively unusual the complex, conflicted empathy of Kimberly Pierce\u2019s film still is in mainstream LGBTQ cinema.\n\nThe Danish Girl came in for a lot of stick from transgender activists, many of whom protested the casting of a cis male actor in the role of a trans woman. Boys Don\u2019t Cry was accused of exploitation in its day too, and has retrospectively received increased criticism over Swank\u2019s casting: indeed, given the sensitivity and conscientiousness of Pierce\u2019s perspective, it seems unlikely that the film would be equivalently cast today. The grievance is understandable: Swank managed to persuasively slip into a tortured skin and slip out of it again, winning a best actress Oscar that, by its very category title, fully affirmed her feminine identity and launched her career as an A-list leading lady who would win another Oscar (this time playing a cis woman, albeit in the butch realm of female boxing) five years later. The prizes for Boys Don\u2019t Cry may have honored Brandon Teena\u2019s legacy, but the happy ending was Swank\u2019s, not his.\n\nYet it would be a mistake to politely sideline Boys Don\u2019t Cry as another miscalculated, progressive-for-its-time casualty of cancel culture. Pierce\u2019s film was hard enough to get made as it was, while the director has explained how she considered various actors across the gender spectrum before settling on Swank\u2019s soulful, anxious imperfection in the part. Boys Don\u2019t Cry was, for many viewers, an introductory text in the understanding of transgender identity; its deep, protective but unsentimental love for Brandon Teena helps it remain one today, however differently it might be made now. \u201cWe have come a long way,\u201d Swank said at the outset of her Oscar acceptance speech, striking a note of proud defiance that didn\u2019t immediately endear her to the Hollywood crowd that prefers gushing, weepy gratitude from its starlets. She was right, of course, however much further we\u2019ve come since.", "description": "In 1999, Hillary Swank won plaudits for playing Brandon Teena, a murdered trans man, but in the years since, a backlash has been brewing", "authors": ["Guy Lodge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d3960ea30b5557e93f2cba50ddbc1f59e41cc7/0_296_1778_1067/master/1778.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a5b8dc69bc2b72d468c0bbd11670be80", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
