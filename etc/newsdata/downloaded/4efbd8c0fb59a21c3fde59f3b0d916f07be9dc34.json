The current 10-year deal expires in March 2021, and the two sides have had preliminary talks on a number of issues.\n\nAmong the tips provided to the players by the union, which was locked out for more than four months in 2011, are to be prepared to be out of work.\n\n\u201cExpiration is Coming, Stay Ready,\u201d the booklet warns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the veterans to step up and tell those guys who weren\u2019t in the NFL back in 2011 that the business of football is serious, a work stoppage is serious, and the best thing that any of us can do is stay ready,\u201d Giants safety Michael Thomas, an NFLPA vice president, said in the guide.\n\nSo the guide suggests such things as:\n\n-build savings;\n\n-modify lifestyles;\n\n-implement a \u201cno spending day\u201d once a week;\n\n-cook more at home, eating out less often;\n\n-cancel unused subscriptions (such as music and video streaming services, gym memberships, shopping apps);\n\n-manage the expectations of friends and family members;\n\n-just say \u201cno.\u201d Don\u2019t let outside requests wreck the budget.\n\nThe union also urges players to \u201cget creative with housing costs\u201d by finding renters for their unoccupied homes or bedrooms which \u201ccan generate extra income and offset the mortgage for that house.\u201d\n\nThe average player salary in the NFL is well over $2 million, but the number is skewed by the monster contracts at the top end, mostly to quarterbacks. There are hundreds of players making far less than that, albeit substantial money. The rookie minimum is close to $500,000, and veteran minimums run from above $700,000 to more than $900,000.\n\nBalancing that: careers are very short, less than three years on average. And players put their bodies on the line daily, in games and practices.\n\nA work stoppage can cut down those careers even more. With that in mind, the guide urges players to begin budgeting, re-examining their housing situations, car, clothing and jewelry expenses.\n\n\u201cWhether you are preparing for a work stoppage or your second career,\u201d the guide says, \u201cyou should have a plan in place to manage the financial transition. One good rule of thumb is to follow the ABCs:\n\nAdjust. Budget. Cut.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tom Canavan contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A potential lockout or strike is 1 1-2 years away, yet the NFL Players Association is handing out \"work stoppage guides to its players.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Barry Wilner"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
