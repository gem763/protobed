I\u2019m the most overrated general,\u201d the former Pentagon chief boasted during the keynote speech at the Al Smith Memorial Foundation dinner on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress.\u201d\n\nSo I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals, and frankly that sounds pretty good to me.\n\nWarming to the somewhat ungainly comparison, Mattis continued, \u201cAnd you do have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Agreement to pause Turkey\u2019s campaign in Syria destroys US credibility, top Democrats say, despite demanding it\n\nTrump reportedly gave Mattis his new sobriquet during a meeting with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on Wednesday after Senate Minority Leader Schumer read a quote from the general nicknamed \u201cMad Dog\u201d suggesting \u201cISIS will resurge\u201d if the US did not remain in Syria.\n\nTrump dismissed Mattis as \u201cnot tough enough,\u201d pointing out that the general had said it would take two years to \u201ccapture ISIS,\u201d but \u201cI captured them in one month.\u201d Mattis resigned as Defense Secretary in February over disagreements with the president\u2019s desire to withdraw from Syria, putting him squarely on the side of the #Resistance \u2013 who welcomed his quips, but wanted more.\n\n\u201cI earned my spurs on the battlefield, Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor, so I\u2019m not in the least put out by [Trump\u2019s insult],\u201d Mattis continued.\n\nI think the only person in the military Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think is overrated\u2026 is Colonel Sanders.\n\nThe jokes are fine ... but General Mattis, we\u2019re past the time for jokes. Tell us what you saw. Tell us what you know. https://t.co/7glbIFJPIY \u2014 Patrick Chovanec (@prchovanec) October 18, 2019\n\nSome took to social media to praise the retired general, but many demanded more than wisecracks. \u201cWhy is Mattis out there cracking jokes when he should be holding daily press conferences detailing Trump\u2019s unfitness as Commander in Chief?\u201d one solemn user tweeted.\n\nI want to laugh at these jokes and I'm sure that Donald Trump will lash out, but what I really want to see is General Mattis telling the truth about Donald Trump's fitness for office. https://t.co/00xk2Ofu5C \u2014 Jennifer Hayden (@Scout_Finch) October 18, 2019\n\nLike this story?
