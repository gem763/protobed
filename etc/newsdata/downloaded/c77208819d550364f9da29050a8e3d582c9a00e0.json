I\u2019m so f------ glad we got Osuna!\u2019\n\nThe Houston Chronicle reported that three eyewitnesses, two of whom were reporters for the paper, confirmed the events described in the Sports Illustrated story. Taubman was referencing Roberto Osuna, 24, who had just blown a crucial save during the top of the ninth inning of Game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees.\n\nThe Astros acquired Osuna from the Blue Jays in July 2018 while he was serving a 75-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball\u2019s Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse policy, the Chronicle reported.\n\n\u201cThe story posted by Sports Illustrated is misleading and completely irresponsible. An Astros player was being asked questions about a difficult outing. Our executive was supporting the player during a difficult time,\u201d the team said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHis comments had everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else\u2014they were also not directed toward any specific reporters. We are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustrated\u2019s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.\u201d\n\nOsuna\u2019s failed save allowed the Yankees\u2019 DJ LeMahieu to hit a two-run home run, tying the gaming in the first half of the final inning of the game. The Astros recovered in the bottom of the ninth when Jose Altuve hit a walk-off home run, pushing Houston to the World Series.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nCanadian prosecutors dropped domestic abuse charges against Osuna last September after the mother of his then-three-year-old child returned to Mexico and declined to testify.
