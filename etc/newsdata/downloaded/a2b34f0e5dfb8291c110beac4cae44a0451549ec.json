(Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nJessica Frede waited all offseason for Sunday\u2019s game. Revenge was on her mind.\n\nThe 30-year-old is still vexed from the stunning non-call on obvious pass interference that sent the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl in January. The referees\u2019 negligence cost her beloved New Orleans Saints dearly that day, but she\u2019s tried to put the play behind her. Sunday\u2019s rematch presented a chance to alleviate some of the pain.\n\nOr so she thought.\n\n\u201cI just feel deflated all over again, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to believe the refs are unaware of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Frede, who was one of many fans to express her discontent on Twitter, said in a phone interview after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019m at the point where the NFL needs to step up and do something intervene. I just feel deflated all over again.\u201d\n\nThe familiar feelings returned with about six minutes left in the second quarter. With the score tied at 3, Rams quarterback Jared Goff fumbled the ball, which was picked up by Saints\u2019 defensive end Cam Jordan and returned 87 yards for a touchdown. It was during the return that the referees struck again: They blew their whistles and stopped the play, ruling Goff had thrown an incomplete pass.\n\nThe call was changed to a fumble after a challenge by Saints Coach Sean Payton, but the touchdown didn\u2019t count because the play was blown dead. Instead of taking a 10-3 lead, the Saints went scoreless on their next possession and trailed at halftime. The rest of the game didn\u2019t go much better, as the Rams won 27-9.\n\nHorrendous call by the refs. Play being blown dead, takes a TD away from the #Saints.\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/Rg1456tFPY \u2014 Garland Gillen (@garlandgillen) September 15, 2019\n\n\u201cI want to believe every Sunday i\u2019m watching a fair and unbiased game,\u201d said Reynold Evans, a 48-year-old New Orleans native who became a diehard fan after the Saints\u2019 lone Super Bowl victory in 2010. \u201cBut now, instead of betting whether we\u2019re gonna win or lose, we bet on how long it\u2019s gonna take for the officials to f--- it up. That\u2019s the general consensus.\u201d\n\nFrede and Evans don\u2019t think the play in question decided Sunday\u2019s game, rather, they see it as even more evidence that the referees or NFL (or both) have conspired against their favorite team. They aren\u2019t alone in that opinion: To express their discontent with the officials in Week 1, many exasperated Saints fans in the crowd wore black-and-white-striped referee jerseys and carried oversized penalty flags.\n\nSaints fans will tell you that game was nearly derailed by the referees, too. In its waning moments, a controversial roughing-the-kicker penalty gave the Houston Texans another chance at an extra point. Houston was able to take a 28-27 lead because of that penalty, but the Saints held on thanks to Drew Brees and a 58-yard field goal by Saints kicker Wil Lutz as time expired.\n\nThat, of course, was the Saints\u2019 first game since the infamous non-call, which made fans so irate multiple lawsuits were filed against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. Their anger was not unfounded: The missed call in the NFC championship game resulted in the NFL making pass interference calls and non-calls reviewable on instant replay after the fact.\n\nWith fans already on edge, Sunday\u2019s game may have transformed some Saints supporters\u2019 disdain for the referees into full-on resentment. Even Payton articulated his frustration with the officials at halftime. According to Erin Andrews of Fox, he stated: \u201cI\u2019m so tired of it, I\u2019m so tired of being on the wrong side of it.\u201d\n\n[How the Saints-Rams no-call changed the NFL]\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the Rams faced no penalty in a separate play when wide receiver Tre\u2019Quan Smith\u2019s helmet was literally ripped off his head.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on, to be honest,\u201d Frede said. \u201cWe just want answers.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Goff even admitted that he thought the play was a clear fumble, adding \u201cwe might\u2019ve got away with one.\u201d Jordan was less jovial; the play would have marked his first career fumble recovery touchdown, and after the game, he told reporters he was \u201ctrying my best not to see red.\"\n\nHe compared the referees to Foot Locker employees, who famously wear referees\u2019 uniforms in-store.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even hear the whistle,\u201d Jordan said, according to nola.com. \u201cI grabbed the ball, 15, 20 yards down the field. Allegedly a whistle was blown \u2014 clearly, I mean, a whistle was blown. Normally you let the play happen. Any Foot Locker \u2014 I mean, referee \u2014 usually tells you, you let the play happen, then you go back and review the play.\u201d\n\nNo disrespect to footlocker https://t.co/YhiBokGL8Z \u2014 cameron jordan (@camjordan94) September 16, 2019\n\nNFL vice president of officiating Al Riveron posted an explanation of the call to Twitter, but failed to explain why the play was ruled dead. Speaking to reporters after the game, according nola.com, Riverson elaborated said the league tells its officials \u201cwhen it doubt, to let it play out.\u201d\n\nThe refs didn\u2019t let it play out Sunday, however, and an injury to Drew Brees has only made things worse for the Saints\u2019 fan base. There are concerns it could be \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nBut Frede isn\u2019t ready to give up. At least, not yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said time and time again \u2018I\u2019m done, I\u2019m giving up for the NFL,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut I love my team too much to just quit.\u201d\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nDrew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger out with injuries on a rough day for NFL quarterbacks\n\nFire breaks out on field before Tennessee Titans\u2019 home opener\n\nBrewer: Lamar Jackson, Baker Mayfield and the dangers of judging quarterbacks too early", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting mugged by the same guy over and over,\" one fan said. \"I hate them.\"", "authors": ["Michael Brice-Saddler", "General Assignment Reporter", "September At Am", "Michael Brice-Saddler Is A General Assignment Reporter.
