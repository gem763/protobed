And it\u2019s a scenario that could well put the social networking platform on a collision course with Binance\u2019s Venus project.\n\nPer Reuters, Facebook\u2019s blockchain chief David Marcus told attendees at a banking seminar,\n\n\u201cWe could do [Libra] differently. Instead of having a synthetic unit [...] we could have a series of stablecoins, a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a pound sterling stablecoin, etc. We could definitely approach this [by] having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenized digital form.\u201d\n\nMarcus also added that Libra needed to \u201cdemonstrate a lot of agility.\u201d He stated, \u201cWhat we care about is the mission and there are a number of ways to go about this.\u201d\n\nBut Facebook\u2019s Libra alternative sounds eerily similar to Binance\u2019s Venus project, unveiled in August this year. In the latter\u2019s own words, Venus would see the exchange \u201cdevelop localized stablecoins and digital assets pegged to fiat currencies across the globe.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Binance even went as far as stating that Venus would be an \u201cindependent, autonomous and regional version of Libra.\u201d The exchange has already won regulatory permission for its USD-pegged stablecoin from authorities in New York.\n\nExpert analysts believe that regulatory clarity on stablecoin-related matters is around the corner in many countries, and that the cryptocurrency world should \u201cexpect a swarm of CorpoCoins\u201d to hit the market. In certain progressive nations such as Japan, stablecoins already have legal status, and can be issued without seeking prior regulatory permission.\n\nRegulators in Europe and the United States have been lining up to take a swipe at Facebook\u2019s Libra since the project was announced, however. France\u2019s finance minister recently claimed that Libra would not be used \u201con European soil.\u201d The minister claimed that he had the backing of his German and Italian counterparts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Group of Seven (G7) largest advanced economies has instructed its members to compete with cryptocurrencies and stablecoins by improving the existing financial system \u2013 and consider issuing digital fiats.\n\nInitial Libra partners Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, eBay, PayPal and Booking Holdings have all pulled out recently, caving in to regulatory pressure from financial bodies and politicians in the United States.\n\nAlso, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan that is developing its own JPM Coin, says Libra was a \"neat idea\" that will never happen.", "description": "Facebook has revealed that it has an alternative to its proposed Libra token \u2013 multiple stablecoins, each pegged to a national fiat.
