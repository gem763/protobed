Bush at a football game last weekend? Don\u2019t be! Rich people love hanging out with other rich people. So, since Ellen\u2019s a multimillionaire, the 43rd President of the United States is a multimillionaire, and Charlotte Jones Anderson\u2014the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Executive Vice President who invited both of them to Sunday\u2019s game\u2014is a multimillionaire, it actually all makes perfect sense that they\u2019d all want to socialize together.\n\nStill, it is confusing to think about how DeGeneres, one of the nation\u2019s foremost openly gay celebrities would, could look past Bush\u2019s years of using the bully pulpit to advocate against LGBTQ rights\u2014not to mention, uhhhh, the unnecessary wars he started in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have killed millions of people and traumatized countless others.\n\nEllen tried to explain away the cognitive dissonance of all this on her talk show Monday morning, saying that \u201cjust because I don\u2019t agree with someone on everything doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not going to be friends with them.\u201d But disagreeing about the Bush administration\u2019s ongoing legacy of global violence against Muslim people seems like more than just a difference of opinion.\n\nDoes Ellen not understand why people are disgusted by that video of her and W. palling around at the football game? Does she just not care?\n\nPossibly!\n\nWhile we\u2019re unable to psychoanalyze a famous stranger from the aggressively air-conditioned comfort of VICE\u2019s Brooklyn office, we can say that it is well documented that wealthy people often struggle with holding empathy for other people.\n\nIn fact, UC Berkeley psychologists Paul Diff and Dacher Keltner have done a number of studies over the past 10 years that suggest that the more material wealth an individual accumulates, the less likely that person is to have compassion and empathy for other people, and to use their wealth to help others in need.\n\nUpper class individuals are also worse at recognizing other people\u2019s emotions, and they\u2019re less likely to pay attention to the people they\u2019re interacting with. Maybe that\u2019s why Ellen\u2019s just not getting why everyone\u2019s so mad. I wonder if she\u2019ll start to get it soon? Or maybe we should just get this class war started, just to be safe.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Harron Walker on Twitter .", "description": "Ellen and Bush don\u2019t really make the strangest of bedfellows, and we have the studies to prove it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9e26d9c94537000a156f42/lede/1570646294197-GettyImages-1179435742.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7838xh;0xw,0.0494xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
