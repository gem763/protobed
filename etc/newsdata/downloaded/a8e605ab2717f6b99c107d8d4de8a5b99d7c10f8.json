Mandatory Credit: Danielle Parhizkaran-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAndreescu beat Serena Williams 6-3 7-5 in Saturday\u2019s final to maintain a 13-match unbeaten run, where she also won the Canadian Open, to break into the top 10 for the first time in her career.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take anything for granted. These are the moments you live for and I\u2019m just beyond blessed,\u201d Andreescu, who moved up 10 places, told Reuters.\n\nAfter taking the first set and leading 5-1 in the second, Andreescu was broken twice by 23-times Grand Slam winner Williams before eventually breaking back and winning the contest to become the first Canadian to win a major in the professional era.\n\n\u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t easy in the final against Serena Williams,\u201d the 19-year-old added. \u201cI think I\u2019m most proud of how I\u2019m able to get into my zone and I was able to block out the crowd too because they were really, really loud.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t do that, I\u2019m sure Serena would have won that second set so I\u2019m really glad with how I handled everything.\u201d\n\nFrench Open champion Barty exited the tournament in the last 16 but regained the number one spot after last year\u2019s champion Naomi Osaka was also knocked out at the same stage.\n\nThe Japanese, who also beat Williams in last year\u2019s final, slipped to fourth in the rankings with Czech Republic\u2019s Karolina Pliskova and Ukraine\u2019s Elina Svitolina leapfrogging her to move up to second and third respectively.\n\nWimbledon champion Simona Halep fell two places down to sixth while Williams fell one spot to ninth despite her run to the final.\n\nIn the ATP rankings, there was no change in the top three with Novak Djokovic leading men\u2019s champion Rafa Nadal, who won his 19th Grand Slam on Sunday, and Roger Federer but this year\u2019s runner-up Daniil Medvedev moved up to a career-high fourth.\n\nMedvedev has had a stellar record since a third-round exit at Wimbledon, reaching the finals of his last four tournaments, winning the Cincinnati Masters last month.", "description": "Australia's Ash Barty has reclaimed the number one spot in the WTA rankings less than a month after losing it while U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu moved up to a career-high fifth after her maiden Grand Slam win in New York.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427994376&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF881DD", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
