He has played three games at this year's Rugby World Cup for the French, scoring one try.\n\nSebastien Vahaamahina with the dumbest decision of the #RWC2019. How can any international rugby player even begin to think he should do that. I\u2019m glad we won\u2019t see him again in this tournament regardless of the result. #WALvFRA \u2014 Jake O'Flaherty (@jakoboflaherty) October 20, 2019\n\nSebastien Vahaamahina was the fool who threw a ludicrous pass which cost @FranceRugby against Wales in the 6N; now he\u2019s brainlessly thrown an elbow in a RWC QF against the same opposition. He doesn\u2019t learn does he? Perhaps @ASMOfficiel will send him to night school? \u2014 Martin Gillingham (@MartGillingham) October 20, 2019", "description": "France lock Sebastien Vahaamahina was sent off in his side's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Wales after a crazy elbow on Aaron Wainwright that cost his side a place in the semi-finals.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/10/19951426-0-image-a-34_1571562407352.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
