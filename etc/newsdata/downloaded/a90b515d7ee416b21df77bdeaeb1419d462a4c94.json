The former vice president has declined to appear on any of the weekend political talk shows since declaring his candidacy, mostly reserving his on-air appearances for venues like late-night comedy shows and \u201cThe View.\u201d", "description": "Advisers to the former vice president wrote to executives at ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and Fox News to \u201cdemand\u201d that Mr. Giuliani not be invited on the air to discuss Ukraine and President Trump.", "authors": ["Michael M.
