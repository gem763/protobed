REUTERS/Adriano Machado\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - France\u2019s foreign minister said on Wednesday that he would soon go to Iraq to discuss a judicial framework to enable jihadists being held in Syria to face trial.\n\n\u201cThe subject with the Iraqi authorities is to find a judicial system that could try all these fighters, including the French ones,\u201d Jean-Yves Le Drian told BFM television, referring to Islamic State militants held in Kurdish-controlled camps in northeastern Syria.\n\nEuropean states are trying to fast-track a plan to shift thousands of foreign Islamic State militants out of Syrian prison camps and into Iraq, after the outbreak of fresh conflict in Syria raised the risk of jihadists escaping or returning home, diplomats and officials have told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be an ad hoc judicial system and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking to the Iraqi authorities about,\u201d le Drian said.\n\nLe Drian said he would head to Iraq very soon because it was vital to offer support to Baghdad which was in danger of seeing the hardline militant group revive its activities in the northwest Iraq.\n\nIraq saw some of the bloodiest battles against Islamic State and its government is already conducting trials of thousands of suspected Islamic State insurgents with many arrested as the group\u2019s strongholds crumbled throughout Iraq.\n\nLe Drian said that nine French women had already escaped on Sunday from the Ain Issa camp in northwestern Syria. Kurdish officials have said almost 800 people fled that camp after the Turkish offensive into northern Syria targeted the area.\n\nLe Drian said women, who had joined Islamic State, should also face justice in the region, although Paris would look to bring back children.\n\n\u201cThe French women who went to this region in 2015 knew what they were doing. They aren\u2019t tourists. They are fighters against France and must face trial (in Iraq) if possible,\u201d he said.", "description": "France's foreign minister said on Wednesday that he would soon go to Iraq to discuss a judicial framework to enable jihadists being held in Syria to face trial.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441394049&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0IM", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
