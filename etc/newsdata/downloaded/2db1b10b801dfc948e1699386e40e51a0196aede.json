He killed himself inside his Manhattan jail cell in mid-August. The multi-millionaire was being held without bail pending trial on child-sex-trafficking charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to his arrest in July, Epstein cultivated relationships with some of the most high-profile scientists around the world and became a generous benefactor to some of their research.\n\nLast month, Stanford, among a number of other institutions, told Buzzfeed that they had searched their financial records and could find no evidence that Epstein\u2019s foundation ever made donations. (A spokesman told Bloomberg that Buzzfeed asked about donations after 2006 and that it was forthright about the 2004 gift).\n\nOn Thursday, Harvard University President Lawrence Bacow said in a letter that prior to Epstein\u2019s guilty plea in 2008, Epstein gave, in total, $8.9 million to the university. While the university already spent most of that money, it plans to redirect the remaining $186,000 to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.\n\nAnd in August, Mount Sinai Health System said it planned to make a charitable contribution equivalent to the undisclosed amount of money it received from Epstein to organizations focused on preventing human trafficking and sexual exploitation.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Media Lab, meanwhile, came under increased scrutiny last week following a New Yorker report that it worked to conceal the extent of its fundraising relationship with Epstein.\n\nThe director of the lab stepped down on Saturday after outcry over his financial connections to Epstein.\n\n\u201cAfter giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately,\u201d the director, Joichi Ito, wrote in an email to the university\u2019s provost, Martin A. Schmidt.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The donation came two years before allegations about the disgraced financier\u2019s sexual misconduct with young girls began making the news.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/Jeffrey-Epstein-T.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
