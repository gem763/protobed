Johnson, Tracy Rucinski and Tim Hepher\n\nSEATTLE/CHICAGO/PARIS, Sept 13 (Reuters) - As Boeing Co sets its sights on winning approval to fly its 737 MAX within weeks, following a six-month safety ban, engineers around the world are rolling out plans for one of the biggest logistical operations in civil aviation history.\n\nInside Boeing's 737 factory at Renton, Washington, south of Seattle, workers have pre-assembled dedicated tool kits for technicians tasked with installing software updates and readying over 500 jets that have sat idle for months, insiders said.\n\nAcross the globe, Boeing teams are hammering out delivery schedules - and financial terms - with airline customers who have been forced to cancel flights, cut routes and fly aging jetliners while they await the MAX's return.\n\nAlthough regulators must still approve the jets for flight, Boeing and airline staff and executives say the world's largest planemaker is weeks into an elaborate blueprint for production, maintenance and delivery that one source said involves 1,500 engineers - as many as it takes to design a small new jet.\n\nAnother likened the logistics to a nation \"going to war.\"\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Engineer John Hamilton called the previously unreported mobilization more like an elaborate \"ballet,\" which includes synchronizing 680 suppliers of everything from carbon brakes to pilot seatbelts.\n\nBoeing will have to juggle the delivery of two different MAX categories: some 250 produced since the ban, parked at various facilities in tail-to-nose configurations that conjure the puzzle game Tetris; and those that will roll off the production line post-approval.\n\nAirlines will mostly handle a third category involving the return to service of 387 aircraft flown before the grounding, though Boeing has already deployed teams around the world to help companies get ready for that process.\n\nBoeing's fastest-selling jet was grounded in March after flight-control software was found to have played a role in two separate crashes that killed 346 people within five months.\n\nThe ban sent shockwaves through aviation, cutting Boeing's profit and margins, with a cost to Boeing so far estimated at $8 billion.\n\nRedeploying hundreds of idle 737 MAX aircraft, which bring in an estimated 40% of Boeing's pre-tax profit, smoothly is crucial for the health of America's top corporate exporter and the country's wider manufacturing sector, whose recent loss of momentum has taken a further knock from the crisis.\n\nBoeing receives much of its cash upon delivery and Fitch Ratings and Moody's have warned its \"stable\" outlook may be at risk, as its plane deliveries fall 72% this year.\n\nPreparations for a return to service are finely tuned to the company's present assumption that the 737 MAX will resume commercial flights in the October-December timeframe, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters in August.\n\nBut the timeline is in the hands of divided regulators around the world who must approve Boeing's proposed software fix for 737 MAX flight controls and new training materials. European regulators plan their own test flights on the changes.\n\n\"We don't control that timeline,\" Muilenburg said. \"We are going to work with the regulators and we are making progress towards that timeline. But if that return to service date changes, it affects everything else.\"\n\nBoeing has told suppliers that it expects the plane to be flying in early November, a senior industry source said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLOGISTICAL GAME PLAN\n\nOnce regulators certify the MAX for flight, Boeing will have to mobilize hundreds of mechanics and pilots to bring the roughly 250 stored aircraft out of hibernation.\n\nAirlines estimate the process - which includes installing new software, changing fluids and cycling the engines - will take 100 to 150 hours per jet, and months in total for Boeing.\n\nIn one example highlighting the minute risks that could upend months of planning, a team of employees is analyzing years of data on December snowfall at an airport in rural Moses Lake, Washington - where Boeing has parked some 100 jets - to predict demand for aircraft anti-freeze and runway performance.\n\nThe maintenance process will be followed several days of test flights as part of a standard customer acceptance period, but another challenge is finding enough pilots to work through the backlog.\n\nStory continues", "description": "SEATTLE/CHICAGO/PARIS, Sept 13 (Reuters) - As Boeing Co sets its sights on winning approval to fly its 737 MAX within weeks, following a six-month safety ban, engineers around the world are rolling out plans for one of the biggest logistical operations in civil aviation history.
