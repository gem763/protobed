The grime was evident: the subway tiles seemed like they hadn\u2019t been cleaned in decades. Ford\u2019s models, who used the platform as a runway, wore choppy faux hawks and silk-jersey T-shirts with the sleeves rolled roughly up over the shoulder atop debutante floor-length skirts\u2060\u2014punk ghosts from an era when the Lower East Side was derelict. Was this glitzy Ford\u2019s ode to gritty New York?\n\n\u201cYes, that was the point!\u201d Ford said as he greeted guests after his show. He leaned in for a bisous-bisous. \u201cI\u2019m kissing everybody,\u201d he added.\n\nFord is the new chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and his setting was indicative of the entire week of New York shows, which took place from September 6-11. Designers drilled into the experience of being American, with settings from Harlem to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, often relying on live music and theatrical performances to help them set the stage. Yes, there were clothes\u2014the kind that people will likely want to wear in their real lives, fantasies be damned.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that New York Fashion Week has languished in recent years, but this season marked an ideological shift: the clothes became the backdrop for the show\u2014and the show carried a deeper message about what each designer stands for. It was reminiscent of the golden period of American fashion design, when New York\u2019s then-leading designers\u2014 Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Halston, Bill Blass\u2014wrought collections from their own life and experiences.\n\nJanelle Monae performs after models present creations from the Ralph Lauren collection during New York Fashion Week in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 7, 2019.

Designers delved into their messages: opposing cultural biases, the experience of being black in America, celebrating curvy bodies and every age of womanhood. There was even a wheelchair section at Tommy Hilfiger\u2019s joyous ode to 1970s Harlem, created in collaboration with the actress Zendaya.\n\nThis season, while people in the front rows and backstage discussed trade tariffs, Brexit and the latest news in Washington, D.C., models twirled and smiled on a remarkable number of runways, including Ralph Lauren, Brandon Maxwell, Sies Marjan and Deveaux. It marked a departure from the stone-faced marches that have been the official walk for a couple of decades. Whatever follows in London, Milan and Paris, New York designers embraced a very American can-do approach that suggested that fashion doesn\u2019t\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014exist outside of politics, culture and the economy.\n\nAfter showing his collection on Friday, CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award winner Telfar Clemens invited guests to a preview of Slave Play, a Broadway play billed as exploring the experiences of three couples navigating race, history, gender and sexuality.\n\nAt Pyer Moss in his native Flatbush, Brooklyn, Kerby Jean-Raymond used a choir called The Pyer Moss Tabernacle Drip Choir Drenched in The Blood on stage at the spectacularly renovated Kings Theatre. The show was the final installment in a three-part series entitled \u201cAmerican, Also\u201d in which Jean-Raymond has explored black people\u2019s often-forgotten contributions to popular culture. He focused this season on Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a \u201940s-era recording artist whose rhythmic gospel music was a precursor to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Among the memorable looks\u2014which included a Reebok athletic capsule collection\u2014were a series of printed fabrics using artwork by Richard Phillips, the artist who was exonerated in 2017 after 45 years in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, international politics were playing out: brands that buy fabric from China or produce collections there are being forced to seek alternatives. The lack of clarity over whether tariffs will shoot as high as 20% added a worrying level of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThis is happening in real time,\u201d said Tory Burch after her show at the Brooklyn Museum on Sunday morning. Her collection was the opposite of city grit: It was an American take on Princess Diana-inspired \u201980s garden-party dressing. \u201cI think all of us want a resolution as soon as possible,\u201d said Burch, who noted that she is looking to move portions of her production outside of China. \u201cNot just in fashion\u2014anyone in business. For us it\u2019s not good. It\u2019s very difficult.\u201d\n\nDiesel is also moving as much as possible to non-China factories. At the Soho launch of its latest Red Tag collection, Stefano Rosso, CEO of Diesel\u2019s US operations (and son of founder Renzo Rosso), said the company has allocated a financial reserve of as much as $500,000 this year for the costly tariffs. \u201cEvery week my production manager comes in with the latest saga,\u201d Rosso said.\n\nBrandon Maxwell\u2019s Spring 2020 Collection Photo: Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press\n\nThe Row doesn\u2019t face such challenges, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen \u2019s brand stayed in its monastic lane. They recognized early on the public\u2019s desire for calming and comfortable collections in deeply luxurious fabrics that are nearly impossible to identify by season.\n\nGabriela Hearst served lunch and promised that her show would be carbon neutral\u2014once she purchased the appropriate number of offsets. While her guests waited for the actress Diane Lane to arrive (Lane whispered to her seat partner that her car had been stuck in traffic on the FDR expressway), they checked their phones to read that President Donald Trump had fired National Security Adviser John Bolton\u2014or perhaps Bolton had resigned first.\n\nAt Carolina Herrera, Wes Gordon\u2019s take on Americana was inspired by California\u2019s super-bloom this spring. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past year and a half trying to make joyful, happy dresses,\u201d he said after his show in Battery Park.\n\nOne could almost smell Texas in Brandon Maxwell\u2019s collection, in which the Texas-born designer introduced two surprises\u2014a whole lot of denim and his first menswear collection. Maxwell sneaked out back for a surreptitious cigarette after the show, which he held in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and said he\u2019d drawn more deeply from his personal world this season. \u201cI live in Brooklyn, and my fiancee is wearing one of my jackets tonight.\u201d With a much broader collection of daywear in addition to the former stylist\u2019s evening looks, Maxwell seemed to be stepping up to a larger-scale brand. \u201cYou decide if that\u2019s the case,\u201d Maxwell said. Then he paused. \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable. Why not?\u201d\n\nRalph Lauren staged an over-the-top nightclub extravaganza that harked back to the glory days of the Stork Club. His primary colored-evening jackets and bugle-beaded overcoats were available immediately afterwards, so any presidential saber-rattling will not upset their price points.\n\nThough he wasn\u2019t quite the last designer to show this week, Michael Kors seemed to be trying to sum the mood up - upliftingly - with a preppy collection that leaned heavily on red, white and blue as the Young People\u2019s Chorus of New York City belted out a medleys of songs \u2014 \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d, Simon and Garfunkle\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u201d \u2014 that left little doubt that Kors thinks America is already great.\n\nBut the ultimate example of where this is all going took place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn when Rihanna filmed an Amazon Prime television special for her Savage X Fenty lingerie line. It featured performers, including Halsey, Migos, and Tierra Whack, with celebrity cameos - Cara Delavingne! Laverne Cox! - that will stream on Amazon on Sept. 20. (Audience members were asked to check their phones to prevent any sneak peaks slipping out on social media.) Backstage, dozens of actors and rappers were corralled and run through a corridor where they were filmed. Diplo waved his hands back and forth across his body and mugged for the camera. Chris Rock wandered around in sunglasses looking perplexed. An MC encouraged fashion-industry guests to \u201cdance and sing with the cast throughout the show. Bring that energy!\u201d\n\nAs several dozen underwear-clad dancers of every imaginable skin color and shape, including several amputees, gyrated onstage, it was easy to imagine Victoria\u2019s Secret executives taking notes about how to message inclusivity and diversity. It may not have been fashion but the crowd left feeling like it is the future.", "description": "New York Fashion Week was at its most inclusive and optimistic in years\u2014on the runways.
