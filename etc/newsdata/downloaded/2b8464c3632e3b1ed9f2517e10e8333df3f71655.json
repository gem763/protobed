Brands restaurant chain announced on Tuesday it had recalled 1 million kilograms of seasoned beef last Friday. According to Taco Bell, the company took action after a customer reportedly found \u201cmetal shavings\u201d in what they had ordered.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we received the first consumer complaint, we immediately acted to remove the product from the affected restaurants and proactively worked with the supplier to inform the USDA of our steps to protect our guests,\u201d said Taco Bell\u2019s President of North America Julie Masino, in a public statement. \u201cNothing is more important than our customers\u2019 safety, and nothing means more to us than their trust.\u201d\n\nTaco Bell determined the beef in question was produced at a plant that sent beef to Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Virginia. But the company pulled beef from 20 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe recall left many customers beefless, angry, and confused.\n\nHey @tacobell can you guys be real about what\u2019s going on with your beef. I love eating there and the secrecy of what\u2019s going on makes me afraid to ever eat at your restaurant again \u2014 ICUrn (@jeff_serenks) October 14, 2019\n\n@tacobell wtf happen to the beef \u2014 poonslayer420 (@WAllYisG2) October 12, 2019\n\n@tacobell ..so disappointed in you.

Birds were chirping intensely, the employees looked tense and people were yelling. This Taco Bell has become the Twilight zone. \u2014 Yousif Elberri (@YElberri) October 11, 2019\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement that there were \u201cno confirmed reports of adverse reactions\u201d from eating Taco Bell beef. The agency\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service said it is concerned that some of the beef may still be lingering in Taco Bell refrigerators, and urged operators to get rid of the beef.\n\nThis incident comes just months after Taco Bell was hit with a crippling tortilla shortage.\n\nWe\u2019re pouring one out for that mountain of spice-filled diarrhoea beef and the tragedy that a few metal shavings can bring.", "description": "Taco Bell stealthily yanked heaps of beef following a report that a diner found metal in their Mexican-inspired fast-food cuisine, angering customers across the U.S....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Bradley Brownell"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ei9qlklrfesfjnkt2qif.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
