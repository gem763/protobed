Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC \u2013 the ACLU alleges that an employee was discriminated against \u2013 ultimately fired \u2013 for being transgender. Rost explained in a statement that his business abides by a \u201cprofessional code of conduct and sex-specific dress code to ensure families can focus on processing their grief.\u201d The employee at the center of the controversy agreed to the code of conduct and dress code but changed his mind years later, expressing a desire to present himself as a female.\n\nRost said the business created the dress code for grieving families and determined that it was in the best interest of those families to reject the employee\u2019s request. He did not violate federal law, but the ACLU argues that the employee\u2019s termination it is a form of sex discrimination.\n\nA lawyer for Rost spoke after the Supreme Court heard the case and said justices were \u201ctroubled\u201d by the ACLU\u2019s argument. He added that the ACLU \u201cseeks to do nothing less than to redefine the meaning of the word sex in federal law\u2013a change that Congress has repeatedly rejected.\u201d\n\nHe said:\n\nOur federal law prohibiting discrimination because of sex in employment, Title XII, is a promise that women will not be treated worse than men and men will not be treated worse than women. The law\u2019s text does not mean that employers must treat biological men as women. The ACLU\u2019s attempt to redefine the word sex creates unfair situations for women and girls and undermines nearly 50 years of advances for women in this country.\n\n\u201cIn this very case, Tom is being punished for having the audacity to apply a sex-specific dress code based on an employee\u2019s biological sex,\u201d he explained, adding that they were \u201creally encouraged\u201d by what happened in court.\n\n\u201cWe were really encouraged by what happened in the court today, because the justices were troubled by the ACLU\u2019s position that you can wipe out all sex-specific policies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJustice Ginsburg observed that unlike other classifications, certain distinctions require treating males and females differently,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJustice Alito noted the Congress is working on these very issues, and he questioned whether courts should ever be in the business of rewriting the law, as the ACLU asks,\u201d he added. \u201cChief Justice Roberts made the same point.\u201d", "description": "An attorney representing funeral home owner\u00a0Thomas Rost said on Tuesday that Supreme Court Justices were \"troubled\" by the ACLU's argument.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/wi/ap/08/3bnmr9g.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
