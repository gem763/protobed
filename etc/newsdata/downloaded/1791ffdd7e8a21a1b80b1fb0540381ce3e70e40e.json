During that time, MPs - not the government - will have the opportunity to reject the EU's date.\n\nThe bill also requires ministers to report to the House of Commons over the next few months. potentially providing more opportunities to take control of the timetable.\n\nBe aware though, this could all change over the next few days because MPs and peers have the power to pass amendments to any law.\n\nMeanwhile, the fallout from No 10's decision to withdraw the party whip from 21 Tory rebels who backed the bill to block no deal has continued to face criticism from others in the party.\n\nA group of around 80 Conservatives have written to the prime minister, calling on him to re-instate the whip to the \"principled, hard-working and dedicated\" MPs.\n\nIn a statement on behalf of the \"One Nation Caucus\", former minister and Tory MP Damian Green said: \"Removing the whip from valued colleagues who have served their country and party with distinction damages our hope of winning the next general election.\"", "description": "The PM put forward his plan in the Commons after MPs backed a bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mgqfp.jpg"}
