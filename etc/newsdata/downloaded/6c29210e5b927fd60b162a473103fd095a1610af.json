England may face a massive task in tackling holders New Zealand but they have built up a huge head of steam after that emphatic quarter-final win over Australia.\n\nEverything is coming to the boil nicely and sometime soon this England side is going to produce a performance for the ages. This Saturday would be the perfect time.\n\nAs Eddie Jones said straight after the game, England still haven\u2019t produced their very best and he most certainly wasn\u2019t playing mind games or being falsely modest.\n\nEngland unquestionably have more gears and they will need them against an in-form New Zealand who were irresistible against, it has to be said, an extremely poor Ireland team who confirmed rumours of their decline.\n\nEngland put in their most commanding performance of their World Cup campaign on Saturday\n\nNew Zealand were superb but in truth they haven\u2019t yet been fully tested in this tournament since their opening game against the Springboks a month ago.\n\nThe stars do seem to be aligning a little for England. Eddie has 31 fit players to pick from so he has all sorts of options. Also, New Zealand will rightly be perceived as favourites. Brilliant, play on that underdog label a little\n\nEddie has also been lucky with avoiding major injuries, but luck has played no part in avoiding yellow and red cards. Their tackling technique has been exemplary all tournament \u2014 low, arms wrapped well timed and strong.\n\nThey are helped in this by the Kamikaze Kids, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill, neither of whom are giants and both go in low naturally. They are also of the modern generation with habits not so ingrained. They have adapted quickly to the new reality.\n\nKyle Sinckler was one of many star performers as Eddie Jones' side blew Australia to pieces\n\nEngland will need to be careful not to allow New Zealand so much possession next week\n\nSomebody has done a brilliant job with the squad generally over the summer in getting England\u2019s older players to refine their technique and as far as is humanly possible.\n\nThey have taken the head high, or even neck high tackle out of the equation and that means they can defend with confidence \u2014 and keep 15 guys on the park.\n\nAlthough this week is different \u2014 World Cup semi-finals don\u2019t come around very often \u2014 England must do nothing differently. They need to tick over quietly early in the week with a couple of short, high quality sessions and avoid distractions and controversy at all cost.\n\nWhat do I mean by distractions? Media requests increasing tenfold, family and friends arriving from home and all of them need tickets. Sponsors and other commercial interests want to get in early with proposals before the job is done.\n\nEddie Jones will make sure that all focus is on the next game as excitement builds in camp\n\nEverything has to go on hold. When I was involved with the GB team at London 2012 we brought in extra personnel to help competitors whose lives were changing overnight but still had events to compete in.\n\nEngland also still have plenty to work on. The fact is they won 40-16 on just 36 per cent possession and if New Zealand find themselves with 64 per cent on Saturday they are unlikely to be so accommodating and muddle headed as the Australians, who kicked the ball away aimlessly on occasions.\n\nAll eyes are on next week but it would be remiss not to pause for a minute to reflect on Saturday's stunning victory.\n\nNew Zealand thumped Ireland but England should not be afraid as they haven't yet been tested\n\nEddie\u2019s bold but well thought out selections worked a treat. Bringing Mako Vunipola back for his first start since February, after his injury problems, opting for the tackling power of Courtney Lawes at lock, moving Owen Farrell to 10 in place of the in-form George Ford, bringing in Henry Slade at 13, shifting Manu Tuilagi to 12. Rarely as a coach do all your calls come off, let alone in a World Cup quarter-final.\n\nAnd finally, take a bow Kyle Sinckler, not only for general play and wonderfully-taken try but for your discipline and focus.\n\nThe Aussies tried to wind him up from the start but Sinckler was ready for it \u2014 he took it with a smile and got on with his work. If England can collectively keep doing that they can beat New Zealand and win the World Cup.", "description": "SIR CLIVE WOODWARD: Everything is coming to the boil nicely and sometime soon this England side is going to produce a performance for the ages.
