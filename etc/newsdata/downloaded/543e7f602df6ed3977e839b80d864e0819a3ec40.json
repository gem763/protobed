The president threatened to sue Facebook and Google in June and has in the past pressured the Justice Department to take action against his perceived foes.\n\n\u201cThe discussion in Silicon Valley is that Zuckerberg is very concerned about the Justice Department, under Bill Barr, bringing an enforcement action to break up the company,\u201d said one cybersecurity researcher and former government official based in Silicon Valley. \u201cSo the fear is that Zuckerberg is trying to appease the Trump administration by not cracking down on right-wing propaganda.\u201d\n\nFacebook has been criticized in recent days, including by Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, for its ad policy, which exempts politicians from third-party fact-checking and arguably facilitates the spread of disinformation.\n\nWhen asked about the gatherings, a senior Trump administration official said \u201cthe White House is looking for meaningful steps from Facebook on a number of fronts,\u201d including \u201ccompetition, free speech for everybody including conservatives, and privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNominal outreach won\u2019t cut it,\u201d the official added.\n\nAs part of the series, Zuckerberg met earlier this year with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who insinuated that Facebook had become a monopoly during a congressional hearing last year; Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has fingered Zuckerberg as contributing to \u201cthe death of free speech in America\u201d; and conservative radio talk host Hugh Hewitt, who has cautioned against a DOJ enforcement action but has called for a \u201cnew regulatory regime\u201d to minimize \u201cbig tech bias\u201d against conservatives.\n\nCNN commentator Mary Katharine Ham, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, AEI fellow and former Washington Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti, Town Hall editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson, and Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell have also attended the dinners, according to the person familiar with the gatherings. Washington Examiner chief political correspondent and Fox News contributor Byron York also confirmed his attendance but declined to disclose the contents of the dinner because there was a prior agreement that it was off-the-record.\n\nA spokesman for Graham confirmed that the South Carolina senator has spoken with Zuckerberg. Carlson, Continetti, Benson, Bozell and Hewitt declined to comment. Ham and Shapiro did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Facebook, noting Zuckerberg's recent meetings in Washington with Democrats, said in a statement, \u201cFor years, Mark Zuckerberg has met with elected officials and thought leaders all across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nEach dinner has been hosted at one of Zuckerberg\u2019s homes in California, and at least one lasted around two-and-a-half to three hours. The conversations center around \u201cfree expression, unfair treatment of conservatives, the appeals process for real or perceived unfair treatment, fact checking, partnerships, and privacy,\u201d the source familiar with the meetings said.\n\n\"My perception of him was more positive than I anticipated,\u201d this person added, referring to Zuckerberg. \u201cHe was receptive and thoughtful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that he wanted to make things right by conservatives,\u201d said another person familiar with the dinners. \u201cI think he\u2019s been genuine in hoping that might happen. Sometimes I think the headwinds are so strong in Palo Alto that I don\u2019t think even he can succeed.\u201d\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has engaged in similar outreach to conservatives in an attempt to gain their trust, and hosted a private dinner in Washington, D.C. with GOP political operatives and commentators in July 2018, according to the Washington Post.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been hosting informal talks and small, off-the-record dinners with conservative journalists, commentators and at least one Republican lawmaker in recent months to talk about issues like free speech and discuss partnerships.
