Do they have no conscience?\u201d\n\nEben and his wife, Letisia (38), had been out with friends when a white Toyota bakkie with a GP registration ran her over.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d had a braai and then decided to have a drink at a new bar that had opened across the street,\u201d Eben says.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t there long and decided to go back home. We were walking across the road when we heard the bakkie approaching. He drove at a hectic speed. Letisia was at the side of the road when the driver lost control of the bakkie and hit her.\u201d\n\nLetisia rolled over the bonnet and fell to the ground. The driver reversed, driving over her, before speeding off.\n\n\u201cI was hysterical. I tried breaking the bakkie\u2019s window with my fist to get the driver out. I practically crushed my hand.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still struggling to understand it. To come to terms with the fact that she won\u2019t be waking up next to me every morning ever again.\u201d\n\nEben and Letisia are both prominent businesspeople in Mbombela and own a construction company.\n\nA case of negligent and reckless driving and culpable homicide has been opened with the police.\n\nCCTV footage of the nearby shopping centre apparently shows how the bakkie ploughed into her and then sped off.\n\n\u201cAs we understand it, the camera did get the guy\u2019s face but we don\u2019t know if the number plate is visible,\u201d Eben says.\n\nPolice have yet to identify the suspect, who\u2019s yet to be found.", "description": "They\u2019d been childhood sweethearts and were together for 27 years \u2013 and then her life was claimed in a hit-and-run.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9420/7c8f8f813c5345dd88f8eff7ed070072.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
