It cost me a lot of money over the years.\" Next to him, Arnault grinned. As jobs were discussed, he gave a thumbs up. Later, the men moved to the blue-and-gold Louis Vuitton ribbon and stood side by side with their scissors, flanked by their teams.\n\nIt was a potent photo op (even though Arnault's shears seemed to get stuck). It was not hard to understand why Trump had made time to stop by.\n\nBut what was LVMH, which also owns brands such as Dior, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Sephora and has numerous US celebrities on its payroll, getting out of it?\n\nBesides becoming the first major fashion group to so publicly align itself with the President, of course. With all the immediate brand equity risks and potential rewards if Trump wins a second term that implies. Not that the group would put it that way, exactly.\n\nWhat Arnault said was: \"We are very honoured to have the President of the United States coming for the opening.\"\n\nHe also said: \"I am not here to judge his types of policies. I have no political role. I am a businessperson. I try to tell him what I think for the success of the economy of the country, and the success of what we are doing.\"\n\nIn an interview earlier, Burke noted Trump was a \"democratically elected President,\" and if that President wanted to come christen a new workshop, well \u2013 \"how should we react?\" As for the fact the event just happened to be sandwiched between a re-election fundraiser and a rally, \"we have nothing to do with the timing\".\n\nWhether a claim of being apolitical can survive the optics of the presidential helicopter landing on the newly mowed field of a ranch with \"LV\" carved into its stone columns, however, is another question. Especially at a time when consumers are increasingly demanding brands stand up, and speak up, for their values.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There's a lot of anger out there right now against the Trump administration,\" wrote Shannon Coulter, the founder of #grabyourwallet, the social media campaign to boycott brands financially connected to the Trumps, in an email. \"I think Louis Vuitton is about to find out just how much.\"\n\nThis is probably not the case in Johnson County, where 77.5 per cent of the vote went for Trump in 2016 and where the streets in communities such as Keene were lined with flags for the presidential visit. But, wrote Coulter (who is not planning a Vuitton boycott), \"for many Americans, any brand that chooses to associate itself with the Trump administration is also associating itself with the separation of children from their parents.\"\n\nIndeed, any connection with Trump and his family has been notoriously complicated for brands, which have been the target of very public consumer ire over their ties with the President and his policies.\n\nIn 2016, for example, New Balance suffered when it welcomed Trump's victory and the end of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Later, Home Depot was attacked when it was revealed the company's chairman was contributing to Trump's re-election campaign. Most recently, memberships at Equinox and Soul Cycle were cancelled after one of their owners, Stephen Ross, hosted a Trump fundraiser in the Hamptons.\n\n'In a bubble'\n\nArnault first met Trump, he said, in New York in the 1980s, and when the new President invited him to Trump Tower in January 2017, he went, along with his son Alexandre. That was when he and Trump first discussed his plans to open a new facility in the United States, and Trump said when that happened, he would go to the opening.\n\nArnault also attended the Trumps' first state dinner, for President Emmanuel Macron of France \u2013 to which Macron's wife, Brigitte, wore Louis Vuitton. (Vuitton has become a sort of de facto dresser to the French first lady.) Melania Trump often chooses Dior, another LVMH brand, for her public appearances.\n\nAccording to Burke, Arnault and Trump \"have regular conversations\", though when asked if they were \"friends\", Arnault looked surprised and said, \"No\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's possible, said Charles Day, a leadership adviser with the Boswell Group of psychological management consultants, that Arnault \"is operating in a bubble\".\n\n\"He wouldn't be the first; the more powerful the leader, the stronger the bubble,\" Day added. \"But more likely is that he wants something from the relationship. Maybe tariff related. And his calculation is that LVMH is so vast that it will be difficult for protesters to target.\"\n\nA player in the corridors of power\n\nArnault is no stranger to controversy, having made his name as \"the wolf in the cashmere coat\" when he scandalised the French business community with his ruthless acquisitions of hallowed family brands in the 1980s and '90s.\n\nHe laid the bedrock for the modern luxury industry, and has since softened his public image, inviting the public inside the couture ateliers and Champagne estates of his brands during special \"Heritage Days\" events, and establishing a contemporary art museum in the Bois de Boulogne \u2013 the Fondation Louis Vuitton \u2013 which will become a gift to the city of Paris in about 45 years. But he also made news last month when he publicly scolded Greta Thunberg, the young climate activist, for \"surrendering completely to catastrophism\".\n\nHe has also long played in the corridors of power. Aside from Macron, he also was close to a previous president, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. (Trump asked Arnault to \"say hello to Emmanuel\" for him, despite the fact \"we have our little disputes every once in a while\".) Yet Arnault has never been as public about his alignment with Trump, or that of his most prominent brand, as he was in Texas.\n\nPlans for the Texas factory, which is called the Louis Vuitton Rochambeau Ranch after Marshal Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau, a general who was in charge of the French forces in America during the Revolutionary War, were developed in 2017. Originally, the land was known as the Rockin' Z Ranch.\n\nVuitton, which is the most valuable luxury brand in the world, according to Forbes, is the largest brand in the LVMH stable of more than 70 fashion, beauty, alcohol and hospitality names. LVMH, which had 2018 revenues of \u20ac46.8 billion, has 754 stores and employs about 33,000 people in the United States alone. And it invested $US1 billion in the country's economy last year in salaries, taxes and real estate, according to Arnault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are already two Louis Vuitton workshops in California, in San Dimas and Irwin (for the past 30 years, about half the bags Vuitton sold in the United States have been made there), and the company has had what Burke called a \"special relationship\" with the United States since Georges Vuitton, son of Louis, attended the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Company executives had been looking for another US base of operations to satisfy local demand in what is their largest market.\n\nThey considered North Carolina, but chose to buy the about 100 hectares in Texas instead, in part because of its central location and, they said, coastal accessibility, and in part because of the state's history as a leather-working centre. Part of the deal was a 10-year, 75 per cent tax abatement of about $US91,900 a year, though Burke said that was immaterial. The county also agreed to widen roads, add a roundabout for Vuitton trucks, put in high-speed internet cables and add streetlights.\n\nFrench luxe 'Made in America'\n\nIn return, Vuitton has promised 1000 jobs; the company signed Trump's \"Pledge to America's Workers\", an education and training initiative, the week before the opening. However, at present there were only 150 people employed in Texas (there are an additional 760 in California) \u2013 though that still makes Vuitton the county's fourth-largest employer. Burke declined to reveal how much the Texas facility cost, but Trump announced it in his speech: $US50 million (a Vuitton spokesman later confirmed the number).\n\nWhile all the raw materials, including the leather, machinery and even the thread, are imported from Europe, the employees are local and the bags produced \u2013 which include the Neverfull, Neonoe and M\u00e9tis, among others \u2013 are labelled \"Made in USA\".\n\nAccording to Burke, the company derives no discernible tax benefits from its US handbag production, thanks to the low-duty environment, though in the case of a trade war between the United States and Europe, that obviously would change.\n\nIn his back and forth with reporters during the factory event, Trump had addressed the same question a little more excitedly: \"I can't tax him because he moved to the United States,\" he said of Arnault. \"He has no tariffs whatsoever, because he's in the United States. So we're very happy about that. Very happy.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Arnault and LVMH were among the forces driving the mythology of \"Made in France\" as a factor in brand value, embedded in the high prices of their products. If a bag is made in a French way, but in America and by Americans, does that change the commercial proposition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the news broke about the Texas workshop, some began to express their dismay about both the idea of their Vuitton bags being made in the United States, and the relationship between the President and the brand.\n\nFor now, they are being shrugged off the way Burke shrugged off original complaints about the factory. \"For every one person who complains there are 99 in favour,\" he said. He was wearing bespoke cowboy boots he had bought a few years ago in El Paso. \"You listen to the 99 per cent,\" he added.\n\n\"This is about creating jobs,\" he said later. \"There's a commonality of interests that is absolutely in keeping with what our overriding social duties are.\"\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "LVMH boss Bernard Arnault has long courted successful politicians.
