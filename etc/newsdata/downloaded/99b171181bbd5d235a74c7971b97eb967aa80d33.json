But more generally players are less willing to go there than in the past.\n\n\u201cAgents will be asking for more because they know that for the first time in a long time Man United need players more than players need them. They used to be in the stronger position but they now have a weaker hand and players can use that to their advantage in negotiations.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWoodward recently admitted that United have to be wary of some players using the club for their own means in order to secure a better deal elsewhere.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility by United We Stand , he said: \"We're usually after three players, so we might be talking to nine in reality.\n\n\"What you are referring to in the original question does happen, but it's less likely to happen given our closed-door approach to recruitment targets.\n\n\"But it does exist and we have to be wary of that [players using the club].\n\n\"Sometimes, the amount of time a player or his agent invests into discussions, meetings and contracts shows that there is an interest.\n\n\"If it was only a flippant interest then they could go and put a fake story then go to a club president and go say 'Look at who is in for me.' That happens all the time as well.\n\n\"What sometimes also happens is that we do have a player in an agreed position, but his club refuse to sell and, because the club refuse to sell, the player then uses that to get a new contract.\n\n\"From our perspective, we have to try and see through it and make sure that the club is not being used.\"", "description": "The Leicester midfielder is attracting plenty of interest due to his impressive displays in the Premier League", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Leicester City Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20665419.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Leicester-City-v-Burnley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
