A day later, the lanky Daniil Medvedev made Rafael Nadal work hard for his 19th grand slam title.\n\nConnecting the two was 22-year-old financier Michael Genender, who served as a hitting partner for both Andreescu and Medvedev during the tournament.\n\n\"I will remember it forever,\" Genender told CNN's Patrick Snell.\n\nDanill Medvedev of Russia serves against Rafael Nadal in the US Open final.\n\nFrom left field\n\nGenender, a lefty who plays a two-handed backhand, was a promising collegiate player with Stanford University before trading the tennis court for the stock market.\n\nAt Flushing Meadows he was part of the US Open's hitting partner program, on hand to help players tune up for key matches.\n\nAhead of Andreescu's round-of-16 clash with the left-handed Taylor Townsend, Genender was asked to mimic Townsend's game, employing an aggressive net approach tactic during warm ups.\n\nBianca Andreescu returns a shot during the US Open final against Serena Williams.\n\n'Showed fight'\n\nHe also replicated Nadal (as best he could) by standing far behind the base line on serve as Medvedev worked on his strategy to counter the Spanish great in his first grand slam final.\n\n\"Daniil is a great guy, really down to earth,\" said Genender, who also hit with Naomi Oska's conqueror Belinda Bencic. \"He was very relaxed and knew the magnitude of what was coming.\"\n\nMedvedev, 10 years Nadal's junior at 23, showed real grit, coming back from two sets down to square the match at 2-2 before losing in five sets. Not that Genender is taking any credit for himself.\n\n\"I tried to emulate what Rafa might use,\" Genender added. \"We saw the way [Medvedev] took the two-handed back hand and took it across court. He was more effective with that play. He showed fight.\n\n\"He showed how prepared he was for the battle. We only hit for 25 minutes. Most of his warm up was physical, making sure his body was in the right state to go with Nadal for five hours.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Rafael Nadal: Story of a tennis legend Replay More Videos ...

In that moment it hit me how real this experience was. I will be a fan for life of the game, of Daniil personally and tennis as a whole.\"\n\nWatch the video at the top of the page to see more of Michael Genender's reflections as a hitting partner to the stars.", "description": "Heard the one about the 19-year-old tennis prodigy from Canada, the two-meter-tall Russian and the New York investment banker?", "authors": ["Daniel Gallan", "For Cnn"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190911101506-danill-medvedev-us-open-genender-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
