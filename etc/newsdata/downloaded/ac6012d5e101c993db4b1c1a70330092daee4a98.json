Eric Cabanis/Pool via REUTERS\n\nMacron came to power promising to shake up the economy, but he needs a solid powerbase to deliver that in the face of fierce resistance from trade unions, the political opposition and the grass-roots \u201cyellow vest\u201d protest movement.\n\nShowing the scale of the dissent, around 20 lawmakers with Macron\u2019s La Republique en Marche (LaRem) party are supporting Cedric Villani, who rebelled against the party to run for mayor of Paris against the party\u2019s candidate, according to six parliamentary sources, including two who do not back Villani.\n\nIn another sign of dissent, lawmaker Frederique Lardet, a former hotel executive who quit her job to join Macron\u2019s movement, said she was prepared if necessary to go against the party\u2019s wishes to mount a bid for the job of mayor in her home city of Annecy in the French Alps.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the party, but if I stick to my decision and I\u2019m told to leave the party, I\u2019ll obey,\u201d Lardet told Reuters in an interview, making public for the first time her discontent with LaRem.\n\nAsked to comment on dissent, a LaRem spokesman said: \u201cThere can be disappointment and tensions locally, it\u2019s normal. But in the choices we make, we are careful to remain coherent and try to stick together.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s party has 300 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, so faces no short-term risk of losing the majority he needs to get his reforms adopted into law, but there is growing unease in party ranks.\n\nSince he became president, Macron faced some dissent from the left-wing of his party who disliked his tough stance on immigration and on liberalizing the economy. Nine lawmakers have left the group over policy disagreements since 2018.\n\nThe latest wave of dissent is different because it comes from people who squarely support Macron\u2019s policies but believe the party is being drawn into conducting politics-as-usual. The dissent goes beyond squabbling about mayoral candidates and to the heart of the party\u2019s identity.\n\nEMPEROR\u2019S CLOTHES\n\nFour Macron lawmakers who spoke to Reuters said they were troubled by the party\u2019s decision to pick as its candidate for Paris mayor not Villani, a charismatic mathematician, but Benjamin Griveaux, a long-standing disciple of Macron.\n\n\u201cVillani\u2019s bid highlights what\u2019s wrong with the movement,\u201d one said on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey don\u2019t consult their base enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a bunch of mates who divvy up the positions, and it\u2019s starting to show: the emperor has no clothes,\u201d she added.\n\nAnne-Christine Lang, a Paris lawmaker with Macron\u2019s party who is actively backing Villani\u2019s mayoral bid, said: \u201cVillani embodies the shot of oxygen in political life that Emmanuel Macron used to be.\u201d\n\nImmigration is another source of dissent. Existing criticism from LaRem\u2019s left-wing grew more acute after Macron said last month the party should confront the issue of immigration more forcefully and not act like a \u201cmiddle-class party\u201d which has \u201cno problem\u201d with it.\n\n\u201cThis is about hunting on the right\u2019s turf, that\u2019s clear. That\u2019s not desirable,\u201d said Sonia Krimi, a Tunisia-born LaRem lawmaker.\n\nCAREER CHANGE\n\nIn Annecy, Lardet, 53, was a vice president with international hotel chain Accor before quitting to start a political career with Macron\u2019s party two years ago.\n\nFor the mayoral race in Annecy, she said, LaRem is considering backing the incumbent, Jean-Luc Rigaut, a 60-year-old elected in 2007. She said he was part of a political establishment that the party was supposed to break with.\n\n\u201cThey (LaRem) came to us, we agreed to quit our jobs to make France evolve with us, people from civil society\u201d, said Lardet, speaking in the city\u2019s picturesque mediaeval center. \u201cI am a Republique en Marche lawmaker, but my first party is the people of Annecy.\u201d\n\nThe mayor did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMunicipal elections in March 2020 will be the biggest domestic electoral test to date for Macron since he won the presidency in 2017.\n\nStanislas Guerini, LaRem\u2019s party head, said the party needed to control mayor\u2019s offices throughout France to help push through reforms on the ground. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s missing on the ground, to win the last mile for reforms,\u201d he said.", "description": "Previously-loyal lawmakers inside Emmanuel Macron's party are voicing dissent about its direction, according to interviews with party insiders, exposing new faultlines in the political base the French president needs to deliver his reform agenda.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Pineau", "Michel Rose", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437029551&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930Z3-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
