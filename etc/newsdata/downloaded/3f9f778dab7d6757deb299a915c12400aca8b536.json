The slump has defied all predictions of a rebound as house prices fell around 30%.\n\nAbout 30,000 new homes will be built this year, twice the demand in the Gulf city, property broker JLL estimates.\n\nDamac has dramatically reduced new sales in the past two years and will focus on selling the properties in its inventory, Sajwani said. Still, the developer will complete 4,000 homes this year and an another 6,000 in 2020.\n\n\u201cAll we need is just to freeze the supply,\u201d Sajwani said. \u201cReduce it for a year, maybe 18 months, maybe 2 years,\u201d he said.\n\nBank Risks\n\nSajwani warned that ignoring the oversupply could spell trouble for the city\u2019s banks. The declining value of homes would inevitably lead to growing bad loans and higher provisions against default, hitting profitability.\n\nDubai has recently created a committee to limit supply and ensure that private developers operate in fair environment.\n\n\u201cThe domino effect is ridiculous because Dubai\u2019s economy relies on property heavily,\u201d he said.\n\nSajwani pointed at his competitor Emaar Properties PJSC as the main culprit in the oversupply and said the company offers payment plans that encourage speculation.\n\nThe majority of other big developers, including Meraas Holding LLC and Nakheel PJSC, have halted new construction or cut it back by about 80%, while Emaar continues to \u201cdump\u201d properties on the market, he said.\n\nDamac\u2019s share price has fallen 40% this year and the company won\u2019t pay dividend this year because profitability is down. Sajwani said he prefers to keep the cash in the company to meet financial obligations.\n\nEmaar, which built the world\u2019s tallest tower in Dubai, declined to comment.\n\nEmaar\u2019s website shows a long list of its latest developments, including Arabian Ranches III, Dubai Creek Harbour and Emaar South. The developer has also joined forces with divisions of state-owned builders. Dubai\u2019s government owns about 29% of Emaar.", "description": "Dubai needs to halt all new home construction for one or two years to avert an economic disaster brought on by continued oversupply, according to one of its biggest builders", "authors": ["Zainab Fattah", "Yousef Gamal El-Din"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2244/fb982ea6464949fd9de035e531bb8f2f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
