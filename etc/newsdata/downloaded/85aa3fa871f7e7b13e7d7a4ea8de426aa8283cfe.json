I done something for him - 'You'. It's on his album, isn't it? So when I went to do my one I was told, 'You can't do this, Ed can't do the video. You can't use Ed', basically.\n\n\"He didn't want to stand up to his label - he folded.\n\n\"I knew life wasn't fair, but I didn't know it was this unfair.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wiley is known as the \"Godfather of grime\"\n\nIn a post on his Instagram story on Monday, Ed said: \"I never said no to doing a song for you after we made You for No.5.\"\n\nHe said Wiley had wanted to release his 2011 song If I Could - which features Ed - on the same day his debut single with a major label was released.\n\n\"I merely asked if you could move to a week before or a week after - which you did - the song came out and I'm still very proud of it.\"\n\nEd went on to say he's said \"yes\" to 90% of the features he's been personally asked for - unless he's been on a music break or didn't know the artist.\n\nHe also said his song You Need Me, I Don't Need You was written when he was 15 and \"definitely isn't about anything other than teenage angst\".\n\nSome fans have suggested Wiley's rant against Ed is a publicity tactic - as he has a new album coming out this year.\n\nIt's something Ed says he's looking forward to.\n\nIn the post he wrote: \"You know I have a deep love and respect for the scene, and for you. I look forward to Godfather 3, excited to hear it.\"\n\nListen back to Wiley's interview in full on BBC Sounds.", "description": "The singer says he has a \"deep love and respect\" for the grime artist and for the music genre.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/174AB/production/_108830459_69f06837-c3f5-4507-9763-728031f5be91.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
