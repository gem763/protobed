REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke\n\nMerkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrats and the SPD clung on as the largest parties in Saxony and Brandenburg respectively but bled support to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which came second in both states.\n\nThe AfD harnessed voter anger over refugees and the planned closure of coal mines in the formerly communist east, casting itself as the heir of the demonstrators who brought about the fall of the Berlin Wall three decades ago.\n\n\u201cBoth CDU and SPD suffered significant losses in both states, but ultimately got away with a black eye,\u201d said Kevin Koerner, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Research.\n\n\u201cFor the grand coalition in Berlin, the result of the two state elections probably means a breather.\u201d\n\nThe setbacks for the CDU and SPD were not as great as feared and they took the reprieve as a cue to deliver tangible results before an autumn mid-term review of the national coalition and the SPD\u2019s party congress in December.\n\nIn both Brandenburg and Saxony, the vote was so fragmented that three-way coalitions appear the only route to a majority - a reminder to the CDU and SPD that, however awkward their national alliance, a new election would only complicate matters. Both resolved to double down and deliver results.\n\n\u201cWe learn from yesterday that it\u2019s not enough to complain about the AfD\u2019s election results - we have to be on the ground, we have to deliver,\u201d Manuela Schwesig, one of the SPD\u2019s caretaker leaders, told reporters.\n\n\u201cThat is now the job of the grand coalition in Berlin.\u201d\n\nSPD TURMOIL\n\nThe government\u2019s immediate focus is to agree an ambitious climate package in September - a key policy given the popularity of the Greens, running second behind the conservatives in national polls - and on ways to support the economy, which is on the brink of recession.\n\nLeaders from the ruling coalition parties are due to meet in Berlin on Monday evening to chart an immediate way ahead.\n\nBeyond the autumn, the national coalition\u2019s fate will depend on the SPD\u2019s choice of a new leader, and then the outcome of its party conference in December.\n\nAfter a disastrous performance in European elections in May, the party sank into turmoil, and many rank-and-file members want to quit an alliance that has supported Merkel for 10 of her 14 years in power and rebuild in opposition.\n\nThat would most likely signal the end of the Merkel era - she has already given up the leadership of her party, the Christian Democrats (CDU), and indicated that she will not seek a new term as chancellor - and a potentially awkward choice of leading candidate.\n\nThe leader of the SPD\u2019s youth wing, Kevin Kuehnert, who campaigned against joining the grand coalition in 2017, said the Social Democrats \u201csometimes make ourselves smaller than we are\u201d by governing in the coalition.\n\n\u201cThe pressure to bolt from the government will continue to build, possibly coming to a head at the December party congress,\u201d said Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of the weekly Die Zeit. \u201cIf so, look forward to the end of the Merkel government and early elections.\u201d", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners turned their sights with some relief on new hurdles months down the road after withstanding a far-right battering in two eastern regional elections on Sunday.", "authors": ["Paul Carrel", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425458175&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF811EW"}
