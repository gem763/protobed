Whatever the excuse, Steam does like its sales and leaked info seems to have revealed the dates for all the ones left this year.\n\nThe Halloween Steam Sale starts Monday 28, October and runs until Friday, 1 November.\n\nThe autumn sale runs from Tuesday, 26 November till Tuesday, 3 December (how it\u2019s supposed to be autumn in December we\u2019re not sure, but whatevs).\n\nAnd finally, the winter sale starts on Thursday, 19 December and ends on Thursday, 2 January.\n\nLeaked upcoming @steam_games 2019 sale dates: \ud83c\udf83 Halloween Sale: October 28 \u2013 November 1\n\n\ud83c\udf42 Autumn Sale: November 26 \u2013 December 3\n\n\ud83c\udf85 Winter Sale: December 19 \u2013 January 2 Multiple developers posted it in multiple places despite Valve asking otherwise. But you know how that goes. \u2014 Steam Database (@SteamDB) October 19, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen is the next Steam Sale?\n\nTechnically none of those dates are official but Steam Database has always been very reliable when it comes to this sort of thing, plus it\u2019s not like there are a lot of options for the Halloween sale.\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t been leaked is which games will be involved, but it doesn\u2019t take much of a leap to assume that there\u2019ll be a heavy focus on horror themed titles for the Halloween one.\n\nSales are also a good opportunity for Valve to emphasise Steam\u2019s advantages over the Epic Games Store, so look for them to go all out in terms of bargains.\n\nAlthough recent rumours that EA may be returning to Steam, while still keeping their Origins service running, may mean that Steam also has other surprises laying in wait this year\u2026\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "There\u2019s not one, not two, but three, Steam Sales coming up in the next few months and the first one starts very soon.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/maxresdefault-c378_1571748119.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
