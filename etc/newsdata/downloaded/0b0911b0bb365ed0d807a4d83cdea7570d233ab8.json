Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, leaving Capitol Hill after hours of testimony this month. \u00a9 Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Nameless, faceless and voiceless, the C.I.A. officer who first triggered the greatest threat to President Trump\u2019s tenure in office seemed to be practically the embodiment of the \u201cdeep state\u201d that the president has long accused of trying to take him down.\n\nBut over the last three weeks, the deep state has emerged from the shadows in the form of real live government officials, past and present, who have defied a White House attempt to block cooperation with House impeachment investigators and provided evidence that largely backs up the still-anonymous whistle-blower.\n\nThe parade of witnesses marching to Capitol Hill culminated this week with the dramatic testimony of William B. Taylor Jr., a military officer and diplomat who has served his country for 50 years. Undaunted by White House pressure, he came forward to accuse the same president who sent him to Ukraine a few months ago of abusing his power to advance his own political interests.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nThe House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to force Ukraine to investigate Democrats is the climax of a 33-month scorched-earth struggle between a president with no record of public service and the government he inherited but never trusted. If Mr. Trump is impeached by the House, it will be in part because of some of the same career professionals he has derided as \u201cabsolute scum\u201d or compared to Nazis.\n\n\u201cWith all the denigration and disparagement and diminishment, I think you are seeing some payback here, not by design but by opportunity,\u201d said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Democrat from Washington\u2019s Virginia suburbs who represents many federal employees. \u201cIt\u2019s almost karmic justice. All of a sudden, there\u2019s an opportunity for people who know things to speak out, speak up, testify about and against \u2014 and they\u2019re doing so.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former officials like Marie L. Yovanovitch, Fiona Hill and George P. Kent told House investigators how the government was circumvented by a rogue foreign policy operation on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. Michael McKinley, a four-time ambassador and senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, described resigning after four decades at the State Department over the treatment of the career foreign service.\n\nEven the original Anonymous is back, the unidentified author of a much-discussed essay in The New York Times last year claiming that officials within Mr. Trump\u2019s administration were working \u201cto frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.\u201d The writer, still unnamed, plans to publish a book next month called \u201cA Warning.\u201d\n\nThe witnesses heading to Capitol Hill do not consider themselves part of any nefarious deep state, but simply public servants who have loyally worked for administrations of both parties only to be denigrated, sidelined or forced out of jobs by a president who marinates in suspicion and conspiracy theories.\n\nBut it is also true that some career officials, alarmed at what they saw inside the corridors of government agencies, have sought ways to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s aims by slow-walking his orders, keeping information from him, leaking to reporters or enlisting allies in Congress to intervene.\n\nAnd so what is \u201ckarmic justice\u201d for the career establishment feels like validation to Mr. Trump and his circle that they were right all along.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now, I believe, is a group of mostly career bureaucrats who are saying: \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t like President Trump\u2019s politics so I\u2019m going to participate in this witch hunt that they\u2019re undertaking on the Hill,\u2019\u201d Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters last week.\n\nAn Exodus of Career Officials\n\nMr. Trump has lashed out angrily in recent days, implicitly threatening retribution. At a campaign rally in Dallas last week, he demanded four times to know who the original whistle-blower is.\n\n\u201cIs the whistle-blower a spy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe got a lot of bad people out there,\u201d he added, \u201cbut one by one, we\u2019re advancing. One by one.\u201d\n\nHe did not elaborate, but his administration is moving to weed out career officials at the National Security Council. Robert C. O\u2019Brien, his new national security adviser, plans to pare the council staff by about a third, from 174 policy experts to under 120, by early next year, generally through attrition. He initiated the effort before the whistle-blower complaint became public and frames it as efficiency, but it is seen by some as a way to purge internal \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nThe administration has sought all along to minimize the role of career officials. In the foreign service, 45 percent of the 166 ambassadors serving under Mr. Trump are political appointees chosen based on loyalty and campaign contributions, the highest rate in history, according the American Foreign Service Association.\n\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > President Trump has referred to officials detailed to the White House from agencies around the government as \u201cObama people.\u201d \u00a9 Erin Schaff/The New York Times\n\nAs a result, there has been an exodus from public service. According to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organization, the Trump administration lost nearly 1,200 senior career service employees in its first 18 months \u2014 roughly 40 percent more than during President Barack Obama\u2019s first 18 months in office.\n\nBut now more are speaking out. In a letter to Mr. Pompeo this week, 36 former foreign service officers complained that he had \u201cfailed to protect civil servants from political retaliation,\u201d citing in particular Ms. Yovanovitch, who was removed as ambassador to Ukraine after being targeted by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies.\n\n\u201cThe politicization of our diplomatic corps and the erosion of the values of our oath of office,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwill make us more susceptible to the personal interests of an elite few, at the direct cost of our national security.\u201d\n\nAnother letter signed by more than 270 former employees of the United States Agency for International Development said they were angry at the treatment of public servants and \u201cdistraught at the dangers inherent in the president\u2019s cavalier (and quite possibly corrupt) approach to making foreign policy on impulse and personal interest rather than in response to national security concerns.\u201d\n\nA Familiar Complaint Taken to a New Level\n\nThe notion of a deep state of unelected bureaucrats secretly plotting to control government has a long history but until recently was more associated with foreign countries like Turkey or Egypt. In the United States, it was largely relegated to the political fringe or the subject of Hollywood thrillers.\n\nBut other presidents have viewed career officials warily at times. Ronald Reagan regularly derided bureaucrats and they in turn derided him. Bill Clinton fired the White House Travel Office staff fearing it was loyal to his predecessor. George W. Bush grew frustrated that career diplomats disregarded his \u201cfreedom agenda\u201d foreign policy. Mr. Obama was convinced that the military leadership tried to box him into decisions he did not want to make.\n\nStill, none of them went to war with the professional staff the way Mr. Trump has, a war fomented in part by far-right media and conspiracy theorists who have gained favor in the Trump era, propelling wild ideas into mainstream conversation. Bookstore shelves are stocked by new volumes with \u201cdeep state\u201d in the title. The Epix television thriller \u201cDeep State\u201d refers to a president \u201cwho tweets like a teenage girl\u201d being pressured by sinister forces to go to war.\n\n\u201cWashington hasn\u2019t taken the deep state idea seriously; they treat it as a badge of honor or an inside joke,\u201d said John Gans, the author of \u201cWhite House Warriors,\u201d a history of the National Security Council. \u201cBut it is a concern around the country. And one that has been stoked on the right by those who support the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, the first president never to have served a day in public office or the military, did not use the term deep state at first, but his hostility toward government was strong from the start. He blamed the leak of the so-called Steele dossier of unverified allegations against him on intelligence agencies and never trusted their conclusion that Russia intervened in the 2016 election on his behalf. He bristled at the National Park Service when official photos showed his Inauguration Day crowd was smaller than Mr. Obama\u2019s.\n\nHe referred to officials detailed to the White House from agencies around the government as \u201cObama people.\u201d When transcripts of his telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia were leaked, it convinced him that he could not trust the career staff and so records of subsequent calls were stashed away in a classified database \u2014 including the rough transcript of his July 25 telephone call with Ukraine\u2019s president that now has him on the verge of being impeached.\n\nThe Search for Disloyalists\n\nIt was Stephen K. Bannon, then Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist and a veteran of the conspiracy-minded world of alt-right media, who first articulated the war to come, declaring shortly after the inauguration that the administration\u2019s goal would be the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d\n\nOther aides resisted this mind-set. When Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster became national security adviser, he barred his staff from calling career officials \u201cObama holdovers\u201d and promoted some of them. Soon enough, Mr. Bannon\u2019s allies waged a campaign against General McMaster through Breitbart News and Twitter.\n\nThe search for disloyalty was especially pronounced at the State Department. Diplomats said career officials had largely been cut off from viewing memorandums of conversations written after senior officials talk to foreign leaders, memos traditionally used to help junior officers issue guidance to embassy staff members across the world. (A State Department spokesman denied that access to the memos had been restricted.)\n\nSlideshow by photo services\n\nAt the American Embassy in Ottawa, tensions were high between the ambassador, Kelly Craft, and the highest-ranking career diplomat. One diplomat described a campaign to uncover evidence of staff disloyalty to the Trump administration. Another cast doubt that it was ordered by Ms. Craft but agreed that there was broad discomfort among career diplomats in Ottawa with Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policies.\n\nWhile many career employees have left, some of those who stayed have resisted some of Mr. Trump\u2019s initiatives. After the president canceled large war games with South Korea, the military kept doing them \u2014 just at a smaller scale and without talking about them. Fearing that Mr. Trump would blow up a NATO summit, diplomats negotiated an agreement before the forum even began.\n\nWhen the White House ordered foreign aid frozen this year, agency officials quietly reached out to Congress for help reversing the decision, even drawing up lists of programs that would be starved of funding to help lawmakers pressure the administration. State Department officials similarly enlisted congressional allies to hinder Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to push through proposed weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and other nations.\n\nState and Defense Department officials likewise tried to undermine the president\u2019s decision to hold up the $391 million in security aid to Ukraine that now has him in trouble, going through back channels to tip off lawmakers. Pentagon lawyers even developed a finding that the aid freeze was illegal, according to a congressional aide, only to be rejected by the White House budget office.\n\nMr. Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, made clear to House investigators this week that he sought to resist the president\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine for political help, which he saw as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cimproper.\u201d Even as Mr. Trump pushed to have Ukraine\u2019s president go on CNN to publicly pledge to investigate Democrats, Mr. Taylor testified that he quietly advised Ukrainian officials not to do so for fear of getting involved in American domestic politics.\n\n\u201cAs we are seeing pure-form Trumpism take over foreign policy, it is bumping up against the reality of professionalism,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former Obama administration official. \u201cEven if there are people who may agree with the policy of the Trump administration, the way the administration and this president goes about doing business is unprofessional, unethical, perhaps illegal. And whatever your policy views, that cuts against what these folks have joined government to do.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve Done Big Damage\u2019\n\nMr. Trump first embraced the phrase \u201cdeep state\u201d in June 2017 when he retweeted a post from Sean Hannity of Fox News and then used it himself for the first time on Twitter in November of that year, according to Bill Frischling of Factba.se, a service that analyzes data on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nMr. Trump began using the term in speeches and media appearances in August 2018 at a Republican dinner in October, but he has turned to it increasingly as time has passed. He has referred to a deep state 23 times so far this year, twice as often as last year.\n\nAt the Young Black Leadership Summit this month, he railed against Democrats and \u201ctheir deep-state cronies\u201d who are \u201ccolluding in their effort to overturn the presidential election.\u201d He brought up the \u201cdeep state, whatever you want to call them\u201d again during a trade-pact signing ceremony. At a Louisiana rally, he denounced \u201cthe unholy alliance\u201d of Democrats, the media and \u201cdeep state bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with his former aide Sebastian Gorka, conducted before the impeachment conflict but published in The Daily Caller this month, Mr. Trump described his war with the deep state as fundamental to his presidency.\n\n\u201cIf it all works out, I will consider it one of the greatest things I\u2019ve done,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think with the destruction of the deep state, certainly I\u2019ve done big damage,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve come after me in so many different ways; it\u2019s been such a disgrace. But I think it\u2019ll be one of my great achievements.\u201d\n\nThat was then. Now he faces the counteroffensive. Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, said career officials who suffered in silence finally had a voice. \u201cWhat people are going to learn is this level of dissent has been ongoing almost since Day 1\u201d he said. At first, \u201cit was always a one-off. \u2018This diplomat resigned.\u2019 Then the story would disappear three hours later. It never went anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d he added, \u201cthese people have a platform. And not just a platform, a megaphone.\u201d\n\nReporting was contributed by Adam Goldman, Maggie Haberman, Mark Mazzetti and Eric Schmitt.", "description": "The \"deep state\" has emerged from the shadows in the form of real live government officials who have defied a White House attempt to block cooperation with House impeachment investigators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJggiw.img?h=373&w=624&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&x=862&y=232", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
