Mo Brooks, a Republican from that state:\n\n\"For example, there is a current dispute over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes. Depending on the resolution of that dispute, this data may be relevant to those considerations. We will be studying this issue.\"\n\nIt is unclear exactly how citizenship data could be used to produce a count of unauthorized immigrants needed to exclude them from the apportionment count. Any effort to try to do so would be \"based on estimations that use probabilistic statistical modeling\" to determine the number of unauthorized immigrants and, therefore, unconstitutional, MALDEF attorneys argue in their court filing.\n\nCiting NPR's reporting, the filing also references Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham's vague response to a question Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat from Massachusetts, posed during a congressional hearing in July. Asked whether citizenship will be factored into apportionment after the 2020 census, Dillingham ultimately refused to directly comment on an issue \"currently in litigation.\"\n\nCensus Bureau spokesperson Michael Cook declined to comment on this latest legal filing.\n\n\"We do not provide comments on litigations,\" Cook said in an email.\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Sarah Sutton and the public affairs office of the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, also declined to comment.\n\nMALDEF's latest legal move adds another layer of complexity to the tangled legal battle in Alabama over who will be included in the congressional apportionment count after the census.\n\nThe organization's lawyers have said they do not trust Justice Department attorneys to provide a thorough defense of the Census Bureau.\n\nLast year, U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor of Birmingham, Ala., allowed the groups represented by MALDEF to intervene in Alabama and Brooks' lawsuit by joining the administration in defending the bureau's long-standing policy of including unauthorized immigrants in the apportionment count.\n\nIn September, Proctor also allowed a coalition of 15 states, led by New York, and other groups to defend the bureau.\n\nThrough what's known as a \"cross-claim,\" MALDEF lawyers are alleging that there is a \"live and actual controversy\" between the groups they're representing and the Trump administration in light of the recent statements about apportionment.\n\nMALDEF is also helping to represent Latinx community groups based in Texas and Arizona in a separate lawsuit to block the administration from collecting government records for producing citizenship data in the first place.", "description": "The group is concerned the Trump administration won't follow more than 200 years of precedent in dividing up seats in Congress based on numbers that include unauthorized immigrants.", "authors": ["Hansi Lo Wang"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/01/gettyimages-1155197380_wide-1194df274883c186e18c3278c08c2f629edfdd44.jpg?s=1400"}
