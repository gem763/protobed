General Assembly\u2019s human rights committee, the signers will also call on all countries not to send refugees or asylum seekers back to a place where they face persecution.\n\nChina has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in remote Xinjiang that it describes as \u201cvocational training centres\u201d to stamp out extremism and give people new skills. The United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained.\n\nThe statement on Tuesday is due to be made during a General Assembly rights committee meeting on the elimination of racial discrimination.\n\nDiplomats said other countries who back the statement include: Albania, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Chinese government to uphold its national laws and international obligations and commitments to respect human rights, including freedom of religion or belief, in Xinjiang and across China,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nIt pushes China to \u201curgently\u201d implement recommendations by independent U.N. experts on the situation in Xinjiang, \u201cincluding by refraining from the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and members of other Muslim communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe express concern regarding Chinese authorities harassment and intimidation of civil society representatives who raise concerns about Xinjiang in U.N. fora,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nThe statement follows a similar move in July when 22 states at the U.N. Human Rights Council wrote a letter calling on China to halt its mass detention. In response, Saudi Arabia, Russia and more than 30 other countries wrote a rival letter commending what they called China\u2019s remarkable rights achievements.\n\nWhen asked by Reuters last month if U.S. criticism of China\u2019s policies on Xinjiang and Hong Kong political protests could affect trade talks, China\u2019s state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi, said: \u201cWe hope trade talks can have a loose and good foreign environment.\u201d\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators are working to complete the text of an interim trade agreement for U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile Nov. 16-17.\n\nA U.S. administration official said on Tuesday it might not be completed in time for signing in Chile, but that does not mean the accord is falling apart.\n\nChina dislikes public criticism and met with some foreign envoys ahead of the start of the latest session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, which began last month. Chinese human rights academics also defended Beijing\u2019s policies in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong during a briefing with reporters in New York at China\u2019s U.N. mission last week.\n\nIn response to criticism last week by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence of China\u2019s approach to Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Washington would do better to look at its own domestic problems like gun violence. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Pence\u2019s speech was full of lies and prejudice, and that it had made China \u201cstrongly indignant\u201d.\n\nAt an event on the sidelines of the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, the United States led more than 30 countries last month in condemning what it called China\u2019s \u201chorrific campaign of repression\u201d against Muslims in Xinjiang. China denounced the event.", "description": "The United States, Britain, Germany and more than a dozen other countries will push China on Tuesday at the United Nations to stop the detention of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims, said diplomats, a move likely to anger Beijing as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
