REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File Photo\n\nDUISBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Proceeds from a potential sale of Thyssenkrupp\u2019s (TKAG.DE) elevator division must stay with the group, a leading labour representative said on Thursday, rejecting the idea of a special dividend for shareholders.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Tekin Nasikkol, who heads the works council of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, told journalists. \u201cThe steel unit needs sufficient funds just like the other business areas,\u201d he added.\n\nHis remarks come a day after Thyssenkrupp\u2019s supervisory board reviewed first expressions of interest for the division, which some analysts say could be worth up to 17 billion euros (15.41 billion pounds).\n\nThyssenkrupp, in which Swedish activist fund Cevian owns 18%, is looking to list or sell Elevator Technology, which could bring in billions of euros of cash that is needed to pay pensions, cut debt and support its other struggling units.\n\n\u201cIf someone like Cevian comes and says \u2018we\u2019ll reach into the cash register\u2019 then we\u2019re saying: not with us,\u201d Nasikkol said, adding he expected to clash with Thyssenkrupp management over a planned restructuring of the steel unit.\n\nThe turnaround plan, to be presented in late November, could include more job cuts at the steel unit than the 2,000 previously announced. Nasikkol said there would not be any compulsory layoffs.", "description": "Proceeds from a potential sale of Thyssenkrupp's elevator division must stay with the group, a leading labour representative said on Thursday, rejecting the idea of a special dividend for shareholders.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429038765&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0U6", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
