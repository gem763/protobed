Nor will it mark the end of Brexit, merely herald in the start of negotiations that promise to be significantly more difficult than those we have witnessed to date,\u201d said Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists that he wants to strike a Brexit deal with the EU, but that the agreement must not include the backstop \u2014 the mechanism agreed by his predecessor Theresa May and the EU leaders to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Johnson has repeatedly said the U.K. should leave the EU without a deal on October 31 if no agreement is reached by then.\n\nAccording to the report, a future trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU on World Trade Organization terms following a no-deal Brexit would make the British economy grow at a \u201csignificantly slower pace\u201d than if the country had remained in the EU. Income per capita in the U.K. could be between 4 and 9 percent lower in 10 years than it would otherwise have been, the researchers estimate.\n\nA no-deal Brexit could also lengthen the period of time needed to rebuild cooperation in certain areas such as when it comes to Britons\u2019 economic rights in the EU and security, the researchers warn. As an example, they point to the Europol-Norway security agreement, which took seven years to negotiate.", "description": "EU could withdraw or allow to expire any of the measures aimed at mitigating the impacts of a no-deal Brexit, warn researchers.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1133279491-1200x628.jpg"}
