Moscow has denied any interference.\n\nIn addition, tensions between the United States and Iran have risen since May 2018 when Trump withdrew from a 2015 international nuclear accord with Tehran that put limits on its nuclear program in exchange for easing of sanctions. Trump has since reinstated US sanctions, putting increased pressure on the Iranian economy, including its oil trade.\n\nThe Iranian government did not issue any immediate comment through state-run media on Microsoft\u2019s statement of any link to Phosphorous.\n\nMicrosoft said Phosphorous used information gathered from researching their targets or other means to game password reset or account recovery features and attempt to take over some targeted accounts.\n\nThe attacks disclosed by the company on Friday were not technically sophisticated, the blog said. Hackers tried to use a significant amount of personal information to attack targets, it said.\n\n\u201cThis effort suggests Phosphorous is highly motivated and willing to invest significant time and resources engaging in research and other means of information gathering,\u201d the software company said in a blogpost.\n\nMicrosoft has been tracking Phosphorus since 2013 and said in March that it had received a court order to take control of 99 websites the group used to execute attacks.\n\nThe company said it had notified the customers related to the investigations and threats and has worked with those whose accounts were compromised to secure them.\n\nPhosphorus is also known as APT 35, Charming Kitten and Ajax Security Team, according to Microsoft.", "description": "Group called \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 made more than 2,700 attempts to identify consumer email accounts and attacked 241 of those", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b7a7e58e9274eacb7bc883ea4477c1f60c7248/245_0_4312_2588/master/4312.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c57f3ae15f64823095474fbee5a0f6d3", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
