At the time, it was a rare treat, offering an intimate, humanizing portrait of the \u201cice queen\u201d at the magazine\u2019s helm (only a few years after Wintour had been mythologized in The Devil Wears Prada), plus a glimpse at how some of the world\u2019s most glamorous sausage gets made.\n\nThe documentary was filmed in 2007, the year Sienna Miller appeared on Vogue\u2019s cover in a feathery Marchesa gown. Fashion was about to go through some major changes, and the film arguably captured the magazine\u2019s last gasp of unchecked over-the-top-ness, preserving it in amber and then displaying it two years later to a postrecession audience. It was convincing: Wintour was still \u201cthe most powerful woman in America,\u201d Vogue was the \u201cBible,\u201d and employees like Grace Coddington were nothing short of \u201cgenius.\u201d There were horses and Town Cars and more than one fake papal entourage. People said mean things to other people\u2019s faces in strange, unidentifiable accents. Thakoon was the designer du jour, and photographers like Mario Testino were the opposite of blacklisted. At the time, fashion seemed to exist on its own planet, and watching the documentary as a wide-eyed 17-year-old, I wanted nothing more than to be launched into its orbit.\n\nFashion never stays the same for long, but rewatching The September Issue ten years later, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Like, a lot. So much that my roommate came in and asked what I was watching. Of course this world was never going to last. How could it? But it\u2019s thrilling to be reminded of a time when people actually believed it might \u2014 whether owing to blind optimism or a sense of entitlement. Below, ten ridiculous scenes that we\u2019ll never forget.\n\n1. Anna Wintour Double-Fisting Cell Phones\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nIn the film\u2019s opening scene, we see Anna Wintour heading to the office in a Town Car. In her left hand, she holds her BlackBerry, and in her right, she\u2019s got a Motorola flip phone. While reading an email from Tom Ford on the BlackBerry, she speaks into the phone to someone named Sophie \u2014 presumably an assistant \u2014 asking her to \u201csend the email on\u201d to someone named Jay. Slowly, it dawns on us: She called her assistant to ask her to forward an email. This is what multitasking looked like in 2009.\n\n2. Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley\u2019s Hungry Eyes\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been Bleak Street over here in America,\u201d says Vogue editor Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley in reference to the most recent New York Fashion Week runways. \u201cIt\u2019s a famine of beauty,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s a famine of beauty \u2026 A famine of beauty, honey! My eyes are stah-ving.\u201d He repeats himself until designer Vera Wang gives him a high five, thereby creating the movie\u2019s catchphrase.\n\n3. Stefano Pilati Arguing That Navy Is Totally Different From Black\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nOne of the most painful scenes in the documentary happens when Anna Wintour meets with Yves Saint Laurent designer Stefano Pilati, who left the brand in late 2012. He greets her by kissing her hand, like she really is the pope, and proceeds to show her his very dark upcoming collection. (Wintour often previews collections to make sure they\u2019re on track.) Wintour, who notoriously hates the color black, interrupts after only a few looks: \u201cSo you\u2019re not really feeling for color, Stefano.\u201d Pilati tries blaming his mood, becoming increasingly desperate: \u201cThere\u2019s blue navy! There\u2019s an emerald green!\u201d In his defense, emerald green is definitely a color, but I wouldn\u2019t say that to Anna.\n\n4. Sally Singer Thinking Really Hard About Jackets\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nIn a breakfast meeting, Anna Wintour and the Vogue team share a list of upcoming trends with retail CEOs and buyers. Wintour calls upon features director Sally Singer, who declares with great confidence that the \u201ckey item\u201d for fall is going to be \u2026 the jacket. The suits nods, and Wintour backs her up: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be putting a huge, huge push onto a wardrobe of jackets for the fall issues,\u201d she says, pounding the table. Later in the film, Singer is still haunted by the idea of jackets. \u201cI think the jacket is the new coat,\u201d she says, putting her head in her hands like a woman suffering great emotional turmoil.\n\n5. Edward Enninful Failing to Properly Color-Block\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nEdward Enninful, then a contributing editor, is tasked with a color-blocking shoot for the September issue but cannot seem to figure out what the heck that means, at least in the eyes of his boss. \u201cThere\u2019s always one shoot that\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Coddington says in a premonition. And this is it. \u201cI wanna kill myself!,\u201d Enninful squeals after a run-through in which Wintour nixes nearly everything on his rack. He stress-sips from a gigantic Styrofoam cup of Jamba Juice \u2014 truly a sign of the times \u2014 and Grace consoles him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be tougher,\u201d she says. \u201cOr else you\u2019ll lose.\u201d Clearly, he learned from his mistakes, because he\u2019s now the editor-in-chief of British Vogue.\n\n6. Those Poor Goddamn Rodartes\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nAnna is \u201creally concerned\u201d about how much black there is in the issue, so another look bites the dust, this one by the Mulleavy sisters, the then-up-and-coming designers behind the brand Rodarte. \u201cThose poor goddamn Rodartes!,\u201d fashion editor Grace Coddington tells a guy who doesn\u2019t look like he knows who those poor goddamn Rodartes are in the first place.\n\n7. Bee Shaffer Dragging Her Mom\u2019s Life Work\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t want to work in fashion,\u201d declares Anna Wintour\u2019s daughter, Bee Shaffer, who was around 22 at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a really weird industry to me. I don\u2019t want to put it down, but I would never wanna take it too seriously. Some of the people in there act like fashion is life. It\u2019s really amusing, and you can make fun of them, but for that to be your career \u2026 It\u2019s just \u2026 There are other things out there, I think.\u201d Ouch.\n\n8. Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley\u2019s Luxurious Tennis Getup\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nAs Talley tells it, Ms. Wintour \u201cinaugurated him into health by intervention,\u201d which is a nice way of saying she told him he needed to lose weight and sent him off to a diet-and-fitness center. Now, he plays tennis. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t come to the tennis court in just a pair of shorts and a tennis shirt,\u201d he says. God no! Talley goes to Damon Dash for his sweats and Ralph Lauren for his polos. His \u201ctennis watch\u201d is a diamond-covered Piaget from the \u201960s. Plus, all his gear, including a hat, a towel, and a water-bottle suitcase, is monogrammed Louis Vuitton. \u201cIt\u2019s all a part of being who I am,\u201d he explains. \u201cI have to get up and approach life with my own aesthetics.\u201d\n\n9. Anna Looking Bored As Hell in a Pitch Meeting\n\nThis scene takes place about three-quarters of the way through the documentary, following a poignant moment when Wintour lists the important things her siblings do for a living, adding that they are \u201camused\u201d by her role at Vogue. Sad piano music plays over the most excruciating pitch meeting ever. A young beauty editor suggests a story about \u201cadvancements in eyes.\u201d Anna\u2019s own eyes look nearly closed.\n\n10. Anna Fat-Shaming the Cameraman\n\nPhoto: Lionsgate\n\nIn a brilliant, meta, last-minute move, Grace Coddington decides to include Bob the cameraman, who\u2019s been filming her this whole time, in the (reworked) color-blocking shoot. It makes for a great, forward-thinking image, but Anna Wintour\u2019s only take is that Bob needs to work out. Coddington gasps when she hears this, but Bob, who\u2019s perhaps sipped too much of the Kool-Aid at this point, agrees with Wintour. \u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019s better that you\u2019re not like skinny skinny,\u201d Coddington argues. \u201cTo me, it makes the point that you\u2019re real people and not models. Everybody isn\u2019t perfect in this world. I mean, it\u2019s enough that the models are perfect. You don\u2019t need to go to the gym.\u201d", "description": "When \u201cThe September Issue\u201d documentary premiered in 2009, it gave viewers unprecedented access to both a media empire and the woman, Anna Wintour, at its helm. Ten years later, it\u2019s a relic of a bygone era, and the pros and cons of said culture.", "authors": ["Emilia Petrarca"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/28/the-september-issue/feed-b.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
