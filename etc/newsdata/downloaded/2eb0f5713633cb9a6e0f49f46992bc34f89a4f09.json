The turnout and the tone of this year\u2019s event will act as a guage on the separatist movement ahead of a court ruling linked to a short-lived unilateral declaration of independence in 2017.\n\nAt the same time, 12 Catalan leaders - nine of them jailed - are awaiting a verdict in their trial for rebellion, sedition and misappropriation of public funds over the independence referendum and the botched declaration that followed it.\n\n\u201cWhat the state intends with this sentence is to behead a peaceful movement and, as it cannot detain two million citizens, it locks us up,\u201d said Oriol Junqueras, 50, the jailed leader of the left-wing Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya party.\n\nProsecutors are seeking sentences ranging from 7 to 25 years, the latter only for Junqueras.\n\nAsked if he would rule out acting unilaterally again on a referendum, Junqueras, answering questions from Reuters, said: \u201cWe cannot discard any option that is democratic and peaceful\u201d.\n\nAnother jailed separatist leader, Jordi Cuixart, said on Twitter: \u201cWe will never give up on being free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it again,\u201d he said, using has become a separatist catchphrase referring to the 2017 referendum and independence declaration.\n\nHowever, there are growing divisions among separatists on what the next steps should be.\n\nOne way or the other, the Supreme Court ruling, expected in the first half of October, is likely to mark a defining moment for a movement that triggered Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades in 2017 and still influences its national politics.\n\nEarly on Wednesday close to 450,000 people were registered to take part in the Barcelona demonstration, about 10,000 people below last year\u2019s, said Assemblea Nacional Catalana, the grassroots organization behind the protest.\n\nSpanish and Catalan politicians on Wednesday showed their different expectations for the \u201cDiada\u201d, the anniversary of the fall of Barcelona to Spanish forces in 1714.\n\nSpain\u2019s acting Socialist prime minister Pedro Sanchez said that he hoped that one day, the \u201cDiada\u201d would not be a celebration of \u201conly a part of Catalans\u201d, referring to separatists.\n\nPolice officers block Catalunya\u2019s Parliament entrance to protesters in Barcelona, Spain, September 11, 2019.

The confrontation saw police wielding batons at crowds seeking to vote and prompted the then-conservative government to impose direct rule from Madrid on the region.\n\nA poll published in July by a public Catalan institute showed support for an independent Catalonia at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3% of people against and 44% in favour.", "description": "Catalonia's separatist leaders said independence from Spain was still their goal and another unauthorised referendum remained an option as supporters gathered on Wednesday for an annual march that has come to exemplify Catalan nationalism.", "authors": ["Joan Faus", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428671965&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0WJ", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
