Giuliani, said Thursday he believed that Hunter Biden did not run afoul of any laws in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,\u201d former Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post in his first interview since the disclosure of a whistleblower complaint alleging pressure by Trump on Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymr Zelensky.\n\nLutsenko\u2019s comments about Hunter Biden \u2014 which echo what he told Bloomberg News in May \u2014 were significant because President Trump and his personal attorney Giuliani have sought to stir up suspicions about both Hunter and former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s conduct in Ukraine in recent weeks. Joe Biden is leading Trump in many opinion polls ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nLutsenko has been an elusive figure in recent weeks since stepping down from office in late August, but his conversations with Giuliani figure highly in both Giuliani\u2019s own allegations about corruption in Ukraine and in the whistleblower complaint that was declassified Thursday.\n\n[Intelligence chief defends handling of whistleblower complaint]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son,\u201d Trump told Zelensky in a July 25 phone call, a rough transcript of which was released Wednesday.\n\nTrump went on to tell Zelensky to be in touch with Giuliani and Attorney General William P. Barr and suggested that U.S. investigators could assist the Ukrainians to look into any wrongdoing.\n\nBut Lutsenko said he was not aware of any U.S. law enforcement officials coming to Ukraine to assist in any such probes while he was in office.\n\n\u201cNo American groups came to Ukraine for an investigation\u201d during Lutsenko\u2019s tenure from May 2016 until late August.\n\nGiuliani has alleged that Hunter Biden was involved in corruption during his nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company.\n\nGiuliani has not offered any evidence. Burisma\u2019s owner came under scrutiny by Lutsenko\u2019s predecessors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment, but Hunter Biden was never accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.\n\nAs vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden cannot be responsible for violations of the management of Burisma that took place two years before his arrival,\u201d Lutsenko said.\n\nNatalie Gryvnyak contributed to this report\n\nRead more\n\n5 key takeaways from the whistleblower complaint\n\nTrump\u2019s other Ukraine problem: New concerns about his business\n\nAnalysis: The alarming pattern of Trump actions in whistleblower allegations\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Former prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko also said no U.S. law enforcement officials came to Ukraine to help with corruption probes.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "David L.
