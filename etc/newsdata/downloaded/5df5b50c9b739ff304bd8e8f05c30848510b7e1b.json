I fielded a lot of calls from readers threatening to cancel their subscriptions \u2013 including, on occasion, my mom.\n\nI never got upset about it. Their loss, I figured. I know, because I prowl through at least eight newspapers a day, that I feel about 1,000 per cent smarter and more interesting afterward.\n\nI\u2019ve always noticed a huge difference in leaders who read the news carefully, like Barack Obama, an avid New York Times reader, and those, like Donald Trump, who fail to feed their brains properly. The nasty Narcissus looks at the papers not to broaden himself but for the most narrow of reasons: to hunt for his own name and to search, largely in vain, for any scrap of positive coverage.\n\nTrump cheerleader Tomi Lahren recently tweeted a picture proving that the White House staff is still artificially sweetening what they show the boss. The president sent Lahren a printout of tweets \u2013 including hers \u2013 praising him for his Dallas rally, compiled by his aides to reinforce Trump\u2019s reality distortion field.\n\nPresident Snowflake had a pout this past week and cancelled the White House subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post. He probably thinks the papers are still delivered by boys in tweed news caps tossing them over the fence in the general direction of the West Wing.\n\nGet those damn papers off my lawn!\n\nStephanie Grisham, Trump\u2019s press secretary, imperiously announced that the White House would also strong-arm federal agencies to end their subscriptions to the papers, noting that this would be \u201ca significant cost saving\u201d to taxpayers.\n\nNot as much, of course, as if Trump stopped spending tens of millions on golf outings after savaging his predecessor for excessively hitting the links. Besides, taxpayers would probably be happy to spend the money on newspapers if the president would stop staring at his name and educate himself on the globe.\n\nMission impossible\n\nThe enormity of his stupidity caused him to accomplish the impossible: he managed to bollix up America\u2019s Middle East policy even more, after we had already shattered the region through ignorance and arrogance.\n\nIn dropping The New York Times and The Post, the president came across like all those liberals on Twitter who bristle with cancelitis. They\u2019re always huffing away from our paper only to sneak back a few days later.\n\nTrump\u2019s move is not without precedent.\n\nJFK was widely mocked when he cancelled deliveries of The New York Herald Tribune and said he would read The St Louis Post-Dispatch instead. After sneaking in copies of The Tribune for a while, president Kennedy resumed openly reading it.\n\nYour long-suffering Republican allies/hostages are finally getting tired of having to defend you all the time\n\nThe same will happen with Trump. He can\u2019t quit us. The relationship of Donald and the media is the greatest love affair \u2013 and mutual addiction \u2013 of all time. When he cancels subscriptions, it\u2019s like an angry lover tearing up pictures of a woman he is obsessed with but cannot win over.\n\nNewspapers are liquid history, with deadlines pressing and people trying to pull the wool over our eyes. God knows, we\u2019re not perfect. But we\u2019re definitely better arbiters of objective reality than Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise.\n\nGiven the perverted values we\u2019ve seen in other institutions, such as Facebook, the Catholic Church, the Bush-Cheney White House and the Trump White House, it feels good to be part of an institution that aims to illuminate rather than obscure.\n\nSpin point\n\nSpeaking of spin, I\u2019ve got a push alert for Kellyanne Conway: no matter how many reporters you dress down, your tortured triangle with George and Donald is a real story. No one in Washington has seen anything like it since the days of Martha Mitchell.\n\nSo, Mr President, given that you are shorn from The New York Times and The Post, I feel an obligation to fill you in on what you\u2019re missing:\n\nYou\u2019re about to be impeached.\n\nNancy Pelosi is kicking your butt.\n\nThe Deep State is not only out to get you; it\u2019s gotten you.\n\nThe Republicans on the Hill who tried to crash the hearing \u2013 even though their fellow Republicans were taking part \u2013 looked like fanatical losers. Matt Gaetz compared his stunt to the Spartans and the movie 300, but he\u2019s no Gerard Butler and his pizza party was lame.\n\nYour long-suffering Republican allies/hostages are finally getting tired of having to defend you all the time.\n\nYou\u2019re canny about media. You know that you can\u2019t hurt The New York Times and The Post by having a childish fit of pique; that just sells more newspapers.\n\nThe only way you could cut the clicks is if you calmed down, behaved properly and acted like a decent human being, so that there weren\u2019t always 20 breaking news stories every day about your conspiring and grifting and lying and lunacy. And there\u2019s no chance of that, because then all eyes wouldn\u2019t be on you.\n\nYou\u2019ll sneak back and you know it. \u2013 New York Times", "description": "President\u2019s cancelling of newspaper subscriptions is the act of an angry lover", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4064183&origw=1440", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
