He approached the wrong side of the door to go out and often started to pee in the vestibule, a common sign of cognitive impairment. Long walks \u2014 and sometimes any walks \u2014 were now out of the question.\n\nBut not until I was home all day and heard him whimper almost constantly did I realize we were not doing this much-adored pet any favors by prolonging his life. As a 40-pound springer spaniel mix wintering in New York and summering in Minnesota, he\u2019d led a very full and active life. He hiked in the woods year-round, frolicked in every snowfall in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park and even swam a river with me summer mornings in Minnesota until he was 15.\n\nAlthough he had no discernible fatal disease, we knew that as Max the First (hereafter, Max-I) passed the equivalent of 110 in people years, it was time to say a tearful goodbye. Much to our surprise, he seemed grateful. We had planned to wheel him to the vet in a little red wagon but Max-I, who until then refused to set foot on any block near the vet\u2019s office, now walked there without hesitation under his own steam. I admit that 18 years later I still weep recalling how omniscient he seemed on his last day.\n\nNow, though, I\u2019m the happy parent of Max-II, a 6-year-old Havanese who still runs and swims like a puppy as he approaches what some veterinarians consider middle age for a 17-pound dog. And I hope I\u2019m even smarter now about what it takes to keep him vibrant for as long as his biology will allow.", "description": "As with people, probably the most important measure for keeping dogs healthy and promoting a long, active and happy life is to keep them trim.", "authors": ["Jane E.
