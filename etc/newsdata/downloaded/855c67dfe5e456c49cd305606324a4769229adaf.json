They are discussing whether to grant Britain a short or long extension with a decision expected tomorrow. They are also considering whether they need to convene a special summit in Brussels to do this, or the 27 EU leaders can reach a consensus remotely. If leaders agree a short extension of a few days or weeks, Boris Johnson could try to get his deal over the line and agree a new timetable to get Brexit done. If they agree an extension until January 31 or beyond, Number 10 says it will pull the Bill and challenge Jeremy Corbyn to an election. It is thought this would be held before Christmas, with the last feasible date to hold a vote being December 12. After that civil servants have warned that schools will have to cancel nativity plays and other Christmas events to act as polling stations. It means that how the EU decides to act is crucial in how the future of Brexit and a general election could play out.\n\nIf the EU is unable to agree the terms of a delay then an emergency summit is likely at the start of next week.\n\nThe bloc is split on whether to offer a short or a long delay with French President Emmanuel Macron leading the resistance to a three month extension.\n\nUncertainty over the offer grew this afternoon after Catherine Colonna, the French ambassador to the UK, was pictured leaving 10 Downing Street.\n\nIt is thought the PM could move preemptively this evening to ready the government in case it is a three month extension that is imposed by the bloc.\n\nMr Johnson could table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 which would allow a vote to be held in the Commons on Monday - parliament is not sitting tomorrow - on whether to hold a snap poll.\n\nBy tabling the motion today Mr Johnson will have the option of pressing ahead with the vote at the start of next week if he believes what the EU offers is unacceptable.\n\nHe has long maintained that he is opposed to any delay to Brexit but in the event the bloc came up with something he could agree to - a short delay to allow him to get his deal agreed by MPs - he could always pull the election vote.\n\nThe timing of the motion being tabled is key because election rules dictate that there must be 25 working days before polling day.\n\nThat means that by tabling the motion today - should it happen - MPs could vote for an election on Monday, Parliament would then be dissolved on Tuesday and the election clock would start ticking on Wednesday.\n\nGeneral elections traditionally happen on Thursdays which means that if the timetable outlined above was stuck to then the nation could go to the polls on December 5.\n\nHowever, in order to win a vote on holding a general election Mr Johnson will need to secure the support of two thirds of MPs.\n\nToday it remained unclear whether he will be able to reach that threshold after Tory MPs warned the PM an early election could see them 'stuffed like Christmas turkeys'.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn is battling a Labour rebellion on the same issue amid growing opposition on the backbenches to a snap poll.\n\nA long Brexit delay would almost certainly lead to a snap election being held before Christmas.\n\nMany Tory MPs fear that the party could lose seats in Scotland and London if a vote is held now, because of strong support for Remain in those areas as Mr Johnson pushes for Brexit.\n\nSome Tory backbenchers are deeply sceptical that the Conservatives will be able to win a majority at a snap poll \u2013 a point they have conveyed to Number 10.\n\nAnd many of Mr Corbyn's MPs are set to vote against any move to support Mr Johnson's wish, fearing an electoral disaster.\n\nHowever, in a possible sign he could whip them to back a fixed-term parliament act (FTPA) motion next week, one of his most loyal frontbenchers said they would vote for an election as soon as possible.\n\nIt comes after MPs handed EU leaders power over the timescale of UK politics, with a decision on how long the UK will remain tied to Brussels expected within days.\n\nOne Conservative MP told MailOnline: 'There is not unalloyed enthusiasm on Tory benches for a general election. That has been fed in.'\n\nMeanwhile a Tory source was even more downbeat as they said: 'If we go early we'll be stuffed like Christmas turkeys.'\n\nHowever, party chairman James Cleverly this morning said: 'I don't want to be the Grinch.\n\n'But the point is democracy is incredibly important and we have been prevented on discharging the duty imposed upon us.'\n\nMany Tory MPs fear the party's hardline approach to Brexit could cost it seats in Scotland and in London and it is not clear where gains could be made.\n\nA Cabinet minister told The Sun: 'We'll lose seats in Scotland and London if it's all about Brexit, and I can't see where we'll pick them up.\n\nBoris Johnson said tonight that he wants a general election to be held on December 12\n\nMr Johnson is facing a growing Tory backlash over the prospect of holding an election before Brexit is resolved\n\nThe French ambassador to the UK, Catherine Colonna, was spotted going into 10 Downing Street this afternoon\n\nHow a vote on an election would work Boris Johnson would ask the House of Commons to vote on a motion tabled under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. To succeed it would require the support of two thirds of MPs. Mr Johnson has gone down this path twice before but he was thwarted on both occasions by opposition MPs. If he was able to get the support of two thirds of the Commons the nation would then be on track for a snap poll at some point in the first half of December. However, success or failure on the FTPA motion vote will almost certainly depend on what Labour decides to do.\n\n'Labour is very well dug in across the Northern Brexit seats and it will be very difficult to dislodge them.'\n\nDominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief adviser, is reportedly leading calls to abandon attempts to get the Prime Minister's Brexit deal through Parliament and go for an election.\n\nThere are fears among Conservatives that if there is an election before the UK has left the EU, it will play into the hands of Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.\n\nEven if Mr Johnson does decide to press for an early election there is no guarantee that he will succeed.\n\nVeteran left-winger Mr Corbyn has vowed to support the PM's call for a poll as soon as No Deal Brexit has been taken off the table.\n\nBut two-thirds of the Commons - 434 MPs - is needed to approve an early election.\n\nAnd the 'nightmare' scenario of the party disintegrating emerged as big beasts Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell, who have previously resisted the idea of an early election, stayed ominously silent on the subject.\n\nHowever Labour HQ has sent out a string of loyalists in recent days to play up the chances of the party backing an early election.\n\nMany of Mr Corbyn's MPs are set to vote against any move to support Mr Johnson's wish, fearing an electoral disaster\n\nFrance wants the UK out of the EU within 15 days French president Emmanuel Macron is leading a group of EU rebels who want a Brexit extension of as little as 15 days after Boris Johnson was forced by MPs to hand control to Brussels. EU leaders are discussing today whether to grant Britain a short or long extension - with a decision expected tomorrow. Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain are said to back Mr Macron - with the Netherlands reportedly drifting towards this position. Germany and Ireland however, are among the countries that are more relaxed about the idea of a three-month delay proposed by European Council president Donald Tusk.\n\nThis morning Rebecca Long-Bailey, seen as a potential successor to the 70-year-old opposition leader, said that such a move was Labour's 'position' in a radio interview this morning.\n\nAsked on the BBC's Today programme if Labour would vote for a general election as soon as the Prime Minister asks for one after the EU grants an extension, the shadow business secretary said: 'That's our position.\n\n'But we also want the Prime Minister to look at the compromise that's been offered that a lot of MPs support, and that's the ability to be able to properly scrutinise the Bill.'\n\nBut John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, today appeared to cast doubt on the party's desire for an election as he suggested he wanted Mr Johnson to bring back his deal to the Commons for further scrutiny - even though Labour is opposed to it.\n\n'We're in the process at the moment of trying to see whether or not this compromise we've offered to Boris Johnson will enable him to bring forward a proper programme motion (timetable),' he said.\n\nIt came after senior party figures told MailOnline that Mr Corbyn might not carry enough MPs to help Boris Johnson force a snap election even if he tries.\n\nFrontbenchers fear that the scale of the rebellion by 'scared'' Labour MPs - many of whom are determined to hold a second referendum to cancel Brexit - would be so great that the motion will still be defeated.\n\nParliament effectively handed the EU control over the UK's destiny by voting down the PM's fast-track timetable for the Brexit Bill earlier this week.\n\nThat decision killed off the chances of the crucial legislation being passed in time for the October 31 deadline - and left Mr Johnson waiting to hear what extension Brussels will offer.\n\nDespite protests from the premier, the Remainer Benn Act meant he was forced to send a letter on Parliament's behalf begging for a postponement at the weekend.\n\nThe bloc is not expected to give its verdict until at least tomorrow (Friday), with business at Westminster stalled.\n\nThe 'Grinches' who stole Christmas? Schools could be asked to reschedule their NATIVITY plays to make way for polling stations Schools could be asked to reschedule their nativity plays so that schools can be used as polling booths for a pre-Christmas general election, it emerged today. Downing Street wants to go to the polls in December in the hope of getting a majority for a Brexit deal as soon as possible. But Boris Johnson has been warned of the logistical problems a winter election could bring, including the need for external lighting at polling booths and contingency plans for bad weather, the Times reported. Tory Party chairman James Cleverly told the BBC's Today programme this morning: 'I don't want to be the Grinch. 'But the point is democracy is incredibly important and we have been prevented on discharging the duty imposed upon us.'\n\nMr Johnson has insisted that if the EU offers a long extension he will go full-throttle for a snap election.\n\nBut he has already failed twice to get support for a ballot in the Commons, as Labour argued that the threat of an accidental No Deal was too serious.\n\nIn theory, Mr Corbyn's 245 MPs should be more than enough to reach the two-thirds threshold, when combined with 288 Tories, 35 SNP and 19 Lib Dems.\n\nJust 100 Labour should be enough to guarantee the motion's success, but doubts have been raised over whether that would be possible. A recent meeting of the Parliamentary party was said to be 'unanimous' in saying that a second referendum must come before an election.\n\nOne shadow Cabinet minister told MailOnline: 'It is awful. He could try, but he probably won't have the numbers to get it over the line anyway.\n\n'It just doesn't stack up.'\n\nThe shadow minister predicted that the leadership will wait till the last possible moment and hope events save them from having to make a decision.\n\n'In principle an Opposition should always be wanting to face the electorate. That is pretty much our only reason for being.\n\n'But a lot of people are scared of what will happen. Splitting the party that badly would be the nightmare.\n\n'What is our excuse for not wanting an election? Once we have the extension, what are we going to say?'\n\nThe failure of another early election motion next week would take the turmoil at Westminster to a whole new level.\n\nMr Johnson faces losing a vote on the Queen's Speech today, meaning there will be no legislative programme.\n\nIn previous years that would be the end of a government, as it was a confidence issue.\n\nBut the Fixed Term Parliaments Act has laid waste to the constitution, stripping the PM of prerogative powers to seek a new mandate at a time of their choosing.\n\nInstead, Parliament has chosen to prop up Mr Johnson - who is nowhere near having majority - in No10 and order the government to do its will by passing legislation.\n\nCommons rules have been twisted with the help of Speaker John Bercow to facilitate the process, which effectively tears up the normal division of responsibilities between the legislature and executive.\n\nThere is no sign that Mr Corbyn or any other MP could put together a majority to become PM in this Parliament.", "description": "Boris Johnson convened his Cabinet for a crisis meeting this afternoon just one day before the EU is expected to rule on the length of a Brexit delay", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor", "David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent", "James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20141538-0-image-a-19_1571932787476.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
