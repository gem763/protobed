As the female officer tried to prevent him from doing so, the man produced two knives, attempting to stab the officer twice in the stomach.\n\nIn response the officer drew her Taser, discharging it before pursuing the suspect along with colleagues.\n\nOfficers arrested the man at nearby Clapham Common on suspicion of attempted murder, possession of an offensive weapon and a public order offence. He remains in custody at a south London police station.\n\nAs of yet, the officers have been unable to locate the knives that the man was seen in possession of and discarded between Lynette Avenue and Clapham Common.\n\nChief Superintendent Simon Messinger of the Central South Command Unit said in a statement that the officer\u2019s reaction was a \"testament to her bravery\".", "description": "A man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a female officer was viciously attacked with two knives.", "authors": ["Verity Bowman", "Stephen Pollard", "Michael Deacon", "Benedict Spence", "Tom Harris", "Douglas Carswell", "Joe Armitage", "Asa Bennett", "Daniel Kawczynski", "David Collins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/23/lynette-av-grab-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaufcuXmtQCYSGLjfMYQtWVIH1pSSXsiKJr3HWxRYKu0.PNG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
