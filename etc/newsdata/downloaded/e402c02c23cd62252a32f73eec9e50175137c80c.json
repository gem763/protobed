The transcripts that could doom Trump Read more\n\nBut the roots of the process \u2013 the latest iteration of which started last week when the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump \u2013 date back not only to the American constitution, where it is enshrined in law, but to 14th-century England.\n\nThe first recorded impeachment \u2013 a mechanism by which a legislative body can make charges against a public official \u2013 was in 1376 in England by the \u201cGood Parliament\u201d. William, 4th Baron Latimer, who served in the household of the then king, Edward III, was accused of bribery and corruption by the Good Parliament, so called because of its prosecution of the king\u2019s corrupt ministers.\n\nImpeachment was used as a way of keeping political figures, particularly royal ministers, in check. A conviction could lead to fines, imprisonment or execution.\n\n\u201cSometimes it was just for cleaning out mid-level judges or other bad officials,\u201d said Frank Bowman, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law and author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump. \u201cBut the principal constitutional purpose for Great Britain was as a legislative counterweight to royal overreaching and tendencies towards tyranny, and the like.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOf course, Great Britain did not impeach kings or queens, the only way you could do that was bloody revolution. But on the other hand, if parliament or the interests that were represented in parliament wanted to push back against some royal policy or tendency from the king or queen to get above themselves they would often do so by striking at the royal ministers.\u201d\n\nAlthough the British member of parliament Liz Saville-Roberts recently requested to table a motion to impeach the prime minister, Boris Johnson, generally the law is considered redundant in the UK, where there has not been an impeachment case since 1806.\n\nBut in America, impeachment lives on as an important part of the US constitution, which states: \u201cThe president, vice president and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nImpeachment was first enforced in America when it was under British colonial rule.\n\n\u201cSometimes because royal or proprietary charters actually gave the colonial assemblies impeachment powers, sometimes because the colonists in their assemblies wanted to assume the powers of parliament,\u201d said Bowman.\n\nAfter the ruling British were defeated in the American Revolutionary war, the framers, a group among the patriotic founding fathers, gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 to craft the constitution of the young United States republic.\n\nBowman said all four of the draft plans included impeachment. After some debate over whether it was in fact necessary, in conjunction with a fixed, four-year presidential term and, at the time, a comparatively small federal government, it was decided that impeachment would be included.\n\nFounding father Alexander Hamilton later described its jurisdiction in the Federalist Papers as \u201cthose offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust\u201d.\n\nWhile it shared some similarities to the British version, following a process that started in the lower legislative house followed by a trial by the upper house, the new American impeachment mechanism had some distinct differences.\n\nIn Britain a majority vote in the House of Lords could lead to conviction, but in the US a supermajority of two-thirds of the Senate, the US upper house, was needed, while punishment was limited to removal from office.\n\nThe framers used the phrase \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d, first adopted by the British parliament in 1386, which Bowman believes is evidence that the framers \u201chad in mind the long history of British impeachments\u201d.\n\nHe said they used the term to refer lawmakers to British impeachments as a source of reference, or \u201ccatalogue\u201d, for examples of impeachable offenses and because it was both flexible and implied serious abuses of power.\n\nAt the time, there was not huge confidence in the power and unity of America and considerable worry over the potential influence of European powers, especially Britain and France, according to Beverly Gage, professor of history and American studies at Yale University. There were also fears over corruption, which they hoped the threat or process of impeachment would keep a check on.\n\n\u201cThe founders were obviously quite worried about concentrated executive power. They were especially worried about the ways in which foreign influence and corruption might drive a new executive and so it\u2019s really the final check of Congress on the presidency that\u2019s built into the system,\u201d said Gage.\n\nWhile presidents are often threatened with impeachment, to date, only two \u2013 Andrew Johnson and Clinton \u2013 have had impeachment trials in the Senate. Both were acquitted and remained in office, while Nixon resigned before his impeachment could be voted on.\n\nGage said the process is useful for holding presidential power to account and as a means of investigation.\n\n\u201cThe process itself is going to produce a lot of new revelations \u2026 having a formal investigative process seems important \u2026 and it seems like the right way to be moving forward for now.\u201d", "description": "Before the power to hold public officials to account was written into the US constitution it had a long history in English law", "authors": ["Miranda Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e80b4644311a836ff86351241d06e58ff8212d79/0_51_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=008631678f2bb3bba7d4b1027179948c"}
