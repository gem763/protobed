Touting the agreement, Trump said it's \"a great day for civilization.\" (Oct. 17) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Most Americans believe that President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Syrian border has damaged America\u2019s reputation around the world as a reliable ally, a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds.\n\nEven Republicans, typically in Trump\u2019s corner, by 44%-36% say the nation\u2019s reputation has been hurt.\n\nMany of those surveyed express uncertainty about what to think; only half say they are very or somewhat familiar with rapidly changing developments in the region. The unexpected U.S. withdrawal opened the door to a Turkish military assault on the Kurds, who had been aligned with U.S. forces against ISIS. The White House announced Thursday that Turkey had agreed to a five-day ceasefire to allow Kurds to withdraw from the area.\n\nOverall, a 37% plurality of Americans calls the president\u2019s decision to withdraw the small contingent of U.S. troops wrong because it upset stability in a dangerous region; 27% say it was right because the United States has too many military commitments around the world. More than one in four Republicans see the decision as wrong.\n\nTurkey cease-fire: Mike Pence announces that Turkey agreed to a five-day cease-fire in its Syria assault\n\nOpposition swells among those who are more familiar with what\u2019s happening in the region. By nearly 2-1, 58%-30%, they say the president made the wrong call.\n\n\u201cThe decision to remove troops from northern Syria has not proven to be popular with the American public,\u201d said Cliff Young, the president of Ipsos. \u201cWhile Americans remain divided on most topics, there is some surprising unanimity here, especially among people more familiar with the decision.\u201d\n\nOverall, 54% say the withdrawal has damaged the nation\u2019s standing as a trusted ally.\n\nThe decision has put Trump at odds not only with some GOP voters but also with GOP lawmakers. In the House Wednesday, more than two-thirds of Republicans joined every Democrat in passing a resolution that condemned the withdrawal as a step that endangered the Kurds and benefited Russia, Syria and Iran.\n\nMore: Lindsey Graham to President Trump: `I will hold you accountable' on Turkey's actions in Syria\n\nIn the USA TODAY/Ipsos poll, Americans by more than 3-1 say the nation has an obligation to protect the Kurds, who have been U.S. allies in battles in Syria and Iraq That sentiment crosses party lines.\n\nAnd there is bipartisan concern that the ISIS fighters who have escaped Kurdish prisons in the chaos are likely to pose a terrorist threat down the road: 54% predict they will be a threat in the region, 44% say they will be a threat in the United States.\n\nTrump did get credit from two-thirds of Republicans for delivering on his campaign promise to \u201cend endless wars.\u201d By 57%-26%, Republicans say they back his Syria policy, despite concerns about its consequences.\n\nOverall, however, just 31% of those surveyed say they support the president\u2019s policy on Syria.\n\nThe online poll of 1,006 adults, taken Wednesday and Thursday, has a credibility interval of 3.5 percentage points.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/18/trumps-syria-withdrawal-hurt-americas-reputation-most-say-poll/4018093002/", "description": "Poll: Most Americans, including a plurality of Republicans, say Trump's Syria withdrawal has damaged the U.S. reputation as a trusted ally.", "authors": ["Susan Page", "Published A.M.
