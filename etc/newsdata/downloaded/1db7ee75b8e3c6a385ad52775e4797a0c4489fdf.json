It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\"\n\nBiden has said Trump is the corrupt one, and is asking foreign countries to dig up dirt because he fears the former vice president will defeat him in 2020.\n\nAs for being \"done all the time,\" historians and foreign policy analysts said no previous president has asked foreign countries to get involved in American politics the way Trump has.\n\nThe administration's letter to Pelosi seeking new rules on the impeachment inquiry is expected to echo a request sent earlier this week by House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nUkraine: Text messages show U.S. diplomats believed U.S. aid was linked to Trump's demand for Biden\n\nCriticizing \"the swiftness and recklessness\" of the impeachment drive, McCarthy asked Pelosi if Republicans would be let into the process and if administration lawyers could cross-examine witnesses.\n\n\"Unfortunately, you have given no clear indication as to how your impeachment inquiry will proceed \u2013 including whether key historical precedents or basic standards of due process will be observed,\u201d McCarthy said in his letter.\n\nIn replying to McCarthy, Pelosi said the majority is proceeding under authority it already has.\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,\" Pelosi said in a letter to the House Republican leader.\n\nTrump's China comments: Democrats see echoes of Russia in Trump\u2019s call for China to investigate Joe Biden\n\nThe back-and-forth reflects the political pressures surrounding impeachment.\n\nWhite House and Republican officials have said they want to get all House members on the record about whether they favor an impeachment investigation, particularly Democrats who represent districts carried by Trump in 2016.\n\nRepublicans also question whether Pelosi and the Democratic leadership could get their impeachment inquiry authorized by the full House.\n\n\u201cThe problem is you don't have the votes,\u201d Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., told Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., during a Sept. 17 hearing.\n\nPelosi has repeatedly said that committees are free to conduct their own impeachment investigation, and \"there's no requirement that there be a floor vote.\" Democrats have also said they suspect the White House will try to stonewall their probe.\n\nUkraine weapons deal: Trump administration announces weapons deal with Ukraine amid swirl of impeachment inquiry\n\nThe impeachment investigation centers on Trump's request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to have his government investigate U.S. political rival Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate. Investigators are also looking at whether Trump held up aid to Ukraine until it agreed to investigate Biden and his son, who had business interests in the country.\n\nOn Thursday night, a group of House committee chairmen released text messages from diplomats describing an effort to lobby Zelensky into a public pledge to investigate Biden in exchange for the nearly $400 million in aid as well as a private meeting with Trump.", "description": "Trump and aides plan to tell Pelosi that they will not cooperate with the inquiry until the full House votes to authorize it, officials said Friday.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3g5x5TzFvxycbitbjMhEqg--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/f801aad9c84d7d3caad58f4ec890ce3c", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
