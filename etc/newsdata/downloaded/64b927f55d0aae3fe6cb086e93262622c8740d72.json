It\u2019s \u2018UGE\n\nTo give you a mental picture, Walt Disney World is the literal size of Manhattan. As in, the Manhattan. The one that every single American sitcom is based in. The Manhattan in New York. Got it? Manhattan.\n\nThat\u2019s a massive resort to explore in however long you have there, so just keep that in mind when you\u2019re planning to hit up two different rides on opposite sides of the Manhattan-sized Walt brainchild.\n\nFor the most time-efficient trip, you need to map out your days so you can cover as much ground as possible without missing a single thing.\n\n2. No really, it\u2019s \u2018UGE\n\nAs previously mentioned, Walt Disney World is \u2018uge. Did I tell you all that it\u2019s the size of Manhattan? Crazy stuff.\n\nBut instead of this weird Manhattan unit of measurement I keep going on about, let\u2019s break it down into sections.\n\nThere are four separate theme parks coexisting in the same place \u2013 Magic Kingdom, Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, Epcot and Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom \u2013 as well as two water parks and 25 resort hotels. Here\u2019s an overview:\n\nIt really is a mammoth beast.\n\n3. A food map is a must\n\nI\u2019m just going to burst your bubble and inform you that no, you won\u2019t be able to try every single dish served at Walt Disney World, unless, of course, you have a spare 20 years up your sleeve.\n\nThe good news is that if you really commit to it, you\u2019ll be able to chew off a fair chunk of the park when you\u2019re there. I strongly recommend studying the menus from the restaurants back-to-front and circling your favourite restaurants on the map you\u2019ve printed off (print off a map).\n\nHere are a couple of great starting points if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed:\n\nTip of the iceberg, comrades.\n\n4. Your mates need to be on your level\n\nThis is probably the most important aspect of your entire trip and I\u2019m not exaggerating.\n\nHave you already picked who you\u2019re going with? Have you thought about your choice? No, have you really thought about it? Didn\u2019t think so.\n\nIf you\u2019re dragging along a reluctant mate/datemate/soulmate then expect them to bring you down. You need someone who is as amped as you are to be there, and hyperactive enough to cover hundreds of kilometres in a single day.\n\nHave a long, hard look at the person you\u2019re thinking of taking and question everything.\n\n5. Your phone goes a long way\n\nScratch my previous statement \u2013 this is the most important aspect of your entire trip.\n\nBecause it\u2019s 2019 and everything relies on tech, you absolutely must have a phone on you at all times. Not only to call your pals if you get separated, but to use the Walt Disney World app to book restaurants or use the GPS-enabled maps to suss out which ride you want to go on next. Or just, y\u2019know, quickly send people photos of you wearing Mickey ears to spark rage.\n\nPlus, the entire place has free Wifi so you won\u2019t even use that precious, precious data.\n\nPro tip: a portable phone charger should be the first thing you pack. Well, second if you require medication to live or something, but it should definitely be a priority.", "description": "I won't get too specific about what you should do, but the more you know about Walt Disney World before you go, the better.", "authors": ["Louis Costello"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/08/johnstamos-e1567049826148.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
