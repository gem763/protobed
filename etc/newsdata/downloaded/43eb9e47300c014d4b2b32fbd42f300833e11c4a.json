Malaysia had said it did not receive \"anything official\" from India.\n\nMahathir said on Sunday his government will \"study the impact of the action taken by India\", the government-owned Bernama said.\n\n\"They are exporting goods to Malaysia too. It's not just one-way trade, it's two-way trade,\" Mahathir was quoted as saying in the report.\n\nIndia is the world's biggest importer of edible oils, and is the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil. It bought 3.9 million tonnes of Malaysian palm oil in the first nine months of 2019, according to data compiled by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.\n\nMalaysia's key imports from India include petroleum products, live animals and meats, metals, chemicals and chemical products.", "description": "Malaysia to study impact of India's planned trade action", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D02Y_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
