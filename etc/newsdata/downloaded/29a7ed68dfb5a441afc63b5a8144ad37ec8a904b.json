Showtime is home to the award-winning series \"Homeland\" and the hit show \"Billions,\" and its documentary films include \"The Circus,\" \"Murder in the Bayou\" and \"Shangri-La.\"\n\n\"Our team of award-winning reporters, producers and editors have set the tone for gold-standard longform international reporting and we can't wait to bring those stories to Showtime, who share our passion for quality storytelling, differentiated and important journalism, and distinctive voices that capture the critical issues facing our world today,\" Vice Media CEO Nancy Dubuc said in a statement on Tuesday.", "description": "Showtime announced on Tuesday that it acquired the rights to \"Vice\" and ordered a 13-episode season to run in spring 2020.", "authors": ["Kerry Flynn", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190924122804-vice-media-nancy-dubuc-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
