The irony is that, by trying to play the role of Roy Cohn to Donald Trump, William Barr has basically screwed his boss. If Trump had half a brain, he would be, well, pissed.\"\n\nThe backdrop: Starr was named independent counsel during the Clinton administration to investigate a series of scandals involving the First Family. He eventually adapted the investigation to focus on President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and the president's eventual alleged perjury before a grand jury.\n\nHe quickly became the face of Republicans' impeachment efforts at the time.\n\nLanny Davis, then one of Clinton's lawyers, described Starr as the villain of Clinton impeachment, and said their team's war room strategy was to attack Starr as such.\n\nWhat's next: It's unclear exactly how Schiff\u2019s role and modus operandi will change if Democrats move forward with a formal impeachment vote, Democratic leadership aides say.", "description": "He's acting as both a key committee chairman and chief investigator.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/7d2zj1l5MccJz0syP5j42oYTg-g=/0x0:1280x720/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571821987772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
