I don't think he did any painting after and never mentioned his art.\n\n\"He had five girls and one boy and, like everyone else, was busy working and building the country back up.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the war, he could well have been famous.\"\n\nHe was born Harold David Saxon Jenkins in 1907 in Skewen, Swansea and in 1933 submitted work to London's Royal Academy.\n\nDifferent newspapers lavished praise on this oil painting depicting \"the changing face of Wales\".\n\nImage caption A faded clipping from an unknown 1930s newspaper is one of only two images Margaret has showing her father's work\n\nIt was of a soon-to-be-destroyed rural thatched cottage, with a despondent-looking old man sitting outside as a motor car sped by.\n\nOne clipping said it was \"remarkable\" how he had captured the light and mood.\n\nSaxon described how he was inspired while cycling from his Cardiff home to Swansea and going out to the Vale of Glamorgan every weekend to draw.\n\nHe would stop and sketch scenes before completing landscapes and seascapes.\n\nHowever, modestly, he told one newspaper: \"Art is only a hobby for me so far.\n\n\"I am afraid it may never be more than that but it is a delightful hobby all the same, and therefore its own reward.\"\n\nImage caption Saxon was employed at Ely Paper Mill for most of his career, and worked as an electrician in his spare time\n\nWhen war started, Saxon worked as a policeman in Ely and met his wife, which is when his fledgling art career appears to have ended.\n\nMargaret knew that an aunt in Canada had some of her father's paintings - but when she died, they also disappeared.\n\nOne was donated to Cardiff's Royal Infirmary in the 1930s, but Margaret fears all traces of his talents have may disappeared from the wards there too.", "description": "Attic findings reveal Welsh artist Saxon Jenkins' links to the Royal Family.", "authors": ["Chris Wood", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pjs6z.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
