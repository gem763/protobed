The skirt is also from a charity shop (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\nNina says 90% of her wardrobe is second-hand and encourages others to reuse and recycle.\n\nSometimes when she has worn some of the goods she\u2019s come across, she donates it so others can also enjoy wearing it.\n\nThe thrill of shopping second-hand is also more of a hobby than a necessity, says Nina.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t afford to go somewhere else for clothes, it\u2019s just that I get the fun and excitement out of finding something that\u2019s a lot cheaper.\n\n\u2018I can get an outfit that looks just as good for a fiver rather than paying \u00a350, why wouldn\u2019t anybody want to do that?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not only saving people money going to charity shops but it\u2019s also helping charity and the environment by keeping clothes out of the landfill \u2013 it\u2019s a win-win-win situation.\u2019\n\nNina\u2019s best finds include a brand new Barbour coat for just \u00a320 instead of \u00a3180, Hugo Boss and Givenchy shirts and Moschino and Ralph Lauren jackets and tops for less than a fiver.\n\nIt\u2019s also all about luck, she adds, as she had bought the black evening dress at a charity shop that was closing down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They had an offer to fill a bag for \u00a31. I picked up the dress and had nine other items in the bag, meaning it cost just 10p.\n\n\u2018I wore it to a black-tie event at a charity boxing match and I got compliments on it.\u2019\n\nIt was her mum that introduced her to frugal living as a teenager (Picture: Kennedy News)\n\nDespite being embarrassed at the prospect of buying second-hand clothes when she was younger, Nina said becoming a teenage mum changed her outlook.\n\nNina said: \u2018I had my daughter when I was 16, having a home and baby was very expensive.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a stigma towards charity shops but once you\u2019ve brought an item of clothing home and washed it, it\u2019s brand new.\n\n\u2018Some still have the tags on them, so they\u2019ve never been worn.\n\n\u2018Baby clothes are barely worn before they\u2019re donated to charity shops, a newborn baby\u2019s probably been in it twice.\n\n\u2018The clothes are like brand new, it\u2019s such a shame that all these lovely things aren\u2019t getting used.\u2019\n\nNina now shares her bargains from charity shops, car boots and discount chain Steals to show people the stylish second-hand outfits that can be found.\n\nShe said: \u2018The items I buy are things I would never have gone looking for, I end up falling upon it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I want to look different, stand out and be unique and you can\u2019t get that from just shopping on the high street.\n\nShe adds: \u2018With charity shops, you don\u2019t have to worry about someone wearing the same outfit as you.\u2019\n\nMORE: Thrifty mum pays for daughter\u2019s entire prom night with just \u00a312.50\n\nMORE: Mum saves money by giving her kids \u2018the gift of time\u2019 instead of presents\n\nMORE: Mum spends just \u00a3115 transforming her bathroom into a tropical paradise\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Thrifty mum Nina Dixon, from Blackburn, has snapped up bargains from designer brands including Moschino, Ralph Lauren, and Givenchy.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90827705_1571570202.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
