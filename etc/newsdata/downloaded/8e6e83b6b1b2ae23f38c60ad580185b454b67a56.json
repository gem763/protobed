Made possible through a power purchase agreement (PPA), the area will host a wind farm intended to produce up to 50 MW of wind energy.\n\nAmazon expects the farm will produce 168,000 MWh of clean energy on an annual basis once completed.\n\nSee also: Amazon Kindle Oasis 2019, long-term test: A few features short of perfection\n\nThe retail giant's second and third projects will be located in Warren County, North Carolina, and Prince George County, Virginia. In these areas, solar power is the goal, and Amazon expects the new solar farms to total 215 MW and to generate 500,997 MWh annually.\n\nIt is anticipated that the three projects will begin producing energy in 2021.\n\nAmazon says that the new projects will bring the tally to close to 70 renewable energy schemes worldwide, generating over 1,600 MW.\n\nIn September, Amazon announced its intention to meet the Paris Agreement a decade early through The Climate Pledge. Having co-founded and signed the pledge, Amazon has the goal of becoming zero carbon by 2040 -- and in order to do so, the company intends to reach 80 percent renewable energy by 2024 and become 100 percent powered by renewables by 2030.\n\nCNET: 6 things you haven't tried with your Amazon Echo yet\n\nAs Amazon's business relies so heavily on package delivery, the firm intends to seriously reduce its carbon footprint by making sure 50 percent of shipments are considered carbon neutral by 2030. Part of the plan includes the purchase of 100,000 Rivian electric vans, due to hit the road in 2021.\n\nRivian says the vans, designed specifically for Amazon, should remove roughly four million metric tons of C02 entering the atmosphere per year once the full fleet has been deployed.\n\nTechRepublic: How to calculate AWS costs and avoid paying too much for cloud services\n\nAmazon has launched a transparency website that can be used to track the company's progress towards the adoption of only renewable energy sources.\n\n\"We're committed to investing in renewable energy as a critical step toward addressing our carbon footprint globally,\" said Kara Hurst, Director of Sustainability at Amazon. \"With nearly 70 renewable energy projects around the globe -- including 54 solar rooftops -- we are making significant progress towards reaching Amazon's company-wide commitment to reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.\"\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
