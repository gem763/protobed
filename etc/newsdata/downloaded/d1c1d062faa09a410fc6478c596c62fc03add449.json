The 41-year-old will be out to prove a point otherwise he risks being sacked if the poor results persist.\n\nElsewhere, the spotlight will be on Polokwane City who started well but have watched in horror as the wheels have come off with two back-to-back losses to Highlands and Stellenbosch FC.\n\nCity\u2019s coach Zlatko Krmpotic will hope to bounce back at the expense of Steve Komphela\u2019s out-of-sorts Golden Arrows on Saturday.\n\nThe Fifa international break also served as a welcome relief for the newcomer coaches Norman Mapeza, Luc Eymael and Jozef Vuku\u0161ic who had a chance to work extensively with their new sides, Chippa United, Black Leopards and AmaZulu, respectively.\n\nREAD: Absa Premiership: A break for reflection\n\nTime is not on their side to stamp their authority as they need to move their teams away from the relegation zone.\n\nSome coaches are already on borrowed time and it will depend on who blinks first in the next batch of matches.\n\nThe opening quarter already had three casualties \u2013 Cavin Johnson (AmaZulu), Clinton Larsen (Chippa) and Lionel Soccoia (Leopards) \u2013 and others are already looking over their shoulders as the axe is hovering over them.\n\nAfter registering his first victory in the top flight league just before the break, Stellenbosch coach Steve Barker will be hoping to continue where his newly promoted side left off when they beat Polokwane City away from home a fortnight ago.\n\nVuku\u0161ic also guided AmaZulu to their first full points of the season with a win over Cape Town City and will be yearning for more positive results.\n\nChippa will be hoping that former Zimbabwean international Mapeza is who they have been waiting for to lead them to their first win of the season.", "description": "After recharging their batteries, the Absa Premiership campaigners are back in full swing next week \u2013 albeit just for three rounds of fixtures before yet another international break.", "authors": ["Timothy Molobi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9375/a03fd6519f904795bc05252efbfbdf86.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
