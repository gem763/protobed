REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci/File Photo\n\nFollowing reports Trump sought foreign help to smear Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House would initiate a formal inquiry, saying Trump appeared to have undermined national security and violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe dollar bounced slightly in Asia after falling in U.S. trade overnight following Pelosi\u2019s move, which was announced late on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere was a bit of position unwinding in Asia. After all, the impeachment process could take months. Still, it\u2019s not good news (for the dollar),\u201d said Koichi Kobayashi, manager of currency trade at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Bank.\n\nThe dollar ticked up 0.2% to 107.28 yen JPY=, having slipped to a two-week low of 106.96 the previous day.\n\nThe safe-haven Swiss franc edged back to 0.9866 franc per dollar CHF= from near three-week high of 0.9845 to the dollar on Tuesday.\n\nThe euro, which was battered by weak euro zone economic data earlier this week, inched down 0.2% to $1.1001 EUR=, a hair's breath off Monday's low of $1.0966.\n\nTrump promised on Tuesday to release a transcript of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy amid reports he withheld nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Zelenskiy to launch a probe that would damage Biden.\n\nAlthough it is far from certain whether the inquiry will eventually lead to an impeachment, which needs a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controled Senate, increased political uncertainty is seen as negative for the dollar.\n\nSome market players also suspect domestic political fights will consume Trump\u2019s political capital, making it harder for him to strike any compromise with China on trade and other issues.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump\u2019s rhetoric on China turned harsh once again as he delivered a stinging rebuke to Beijing\u2019s trade practices at the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would not accept a \u201cbad deal\u201d in U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n\nChina\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi quickly hit back, saying Beijing would not be threatened on trade or allow interference in its affairs, including Hong Kong, while having no intention to \u201cplay the Game of Thrones on the world stage\u201d.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s speech was full of sensitive words for China - trade practices, currencies, freedom of religion and so on. It is not hard to imagine it will irritate China,\u201d said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.\n\n\u201cIn the past China has reacted to U.S. pressure on trade by bringing down the yuan. It appears we are having that settings again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chinese yuan was steady at 7.1088 per dollar in onshore trade CNY=CFXS, keeping some distance from 11-1/2-year lows of 7.1854 touched earlier this month.\n\nThe dollar was also undermined by data showing U.S. consumer confidence USCONC=ECI fell by the most in nine months in September, far more than expected.\n\n\u201cNet-net, consumer confidence plunged in September which counts as a big surprise that may sidetrack the economic expansion that is relying on consumer spending to fuel growth,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Bank in New York.\n\n\u201cThis unwelcome news on souring consumer spirits is a startling new development that could even bring more rate cuts later this year from the Federal Reserve,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere, the British pound found some support after the UK Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful in a further blow to his ambition to pull Britain out of European Union next month with or without a deal.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Euro, Hong Kong dollar, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan banknotes are seen in this picture illustration, January 21, 2016.
