Elizabeth Warren for attacks from 2020 rivals, which is surely in response to her mounting support in national polls. As with previous debates, personal attacks were on display despite some calls for civility.\n\nHere are a few of the top moments from Tuesday's debate:\n\nBiden redirects on Ukraine involvement as impeachment takes center stage\n\nAs expected, the first focus of this debate was the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats. At its center is the allegation that Trump pressured Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.\n\nWhen asked whether his son's business interests in Ukraine during his vice presidency, Biden redirected the focus to Trump. The question came after Biden's declaration over the weekend that his family members won't have foreign business relationships if he is elected.\n\nForeign business deals: Hunter Biden says he won't serve on foreign boards if Joe Biden elected president\n\n\u201cLook, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Biden said, before pivoting back to Trump. \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. I\u2019m proud of the judgment he (Hunter) made.\u201d\n\nVice President Joe Biden speaks in a Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University. More\n\nHunter Biden said in an interview with ABC News earlier in the day that he made a \"mistake\" and exercised \"poor judgement\" regarding the political consequences of his seat on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company during his father's time in office. He denied any misconduct.\n\nUkraine explainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases\n\nThis debate was the first opportunity for Democratic candidates to come together on stage after the announcement of the impeachment probe, and candidates reaffirmed their support with varying levels of enthusiasm.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren was asked why voters shouldn't be the ones to determine whether Trump stays in office. \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics,\u201d she said.\n\n\"I\u2019m still waiting to find out form him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in our election makes America great again,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nBut Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard cautioned against purely political motives while pursuing impeachment: \"If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide a terribly divided country.\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris said she doubts the impeachment inquiry will last long.\n\n\u201cAs a former prosecutor,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI know a confession when I see it.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren the target of multiple attacks as her standing in polls rises\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., answers questions during the Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University.
