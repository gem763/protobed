Without moisture, your beard will look dull and brittle, and it might start to feel itchy or develop dandruff \u2014 something you definitely don\u2019t want. But just a few drops of beard oil massaged from the roots of your facial hair to the tips can make your beard glow with the intensity of polished gold.\n\nThe world of beard oils, though, can quickly feel overwhelming: a quick Google search will turn up more iterations of the concoction than we can count. So we called up nine grooming experts to help us separate the good from the great. Two top criteria came up over and over again in our conversations: ingredients (and their quality) and scent. In both cases, our experts agree that less is more. Tony DeAngelis, a co-owner of Blue & Black Barbers who makes his own beard oil that he sells at his shop, says to look for a \u201clight oil that\u2019s paraben-free with a scent you won\u2019t get tired of.\u201d He and the rest of our experts all agreed that the best beard oils will all contain jojoba, argan, grape-seed, or other naturally derived oils that will condition your facial hair and moisturize your skin without clogging your pores. But each had their own favorites when it came to specific brands. Read on for all of their picks, which include fast-absorbing options, oils for treating dandruff and promoting hair growth, and others that come in various soothing scents. We\u2019ve even included the ingredients the pros say you should buy if you want to make your own beard oil at home.\n\nBest overall beard oil\n\nGrave Before Shave Beard Oil $27 (was $30, now 10% off) All of the beard oils our experts recommend, including this one, either contain jojoba oil, argan oil, grape-seed oil, avocado oil \u2014 or a combination of the four. According to Chad Beightol of New York City\u2013based grooming store Consiglieri, \u201cjojoba oil is closest to the oil in your skin, and therefore doesn\u2019t clog your pores.\u201d Argan oil has high levels of vitamin E, omega 3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, making it an excellent anti-aging moisturizer and great for softening dry, damaged hair. Grape-seed oil, which is lighter than jojoba oil, is high in linoleic acid and thought to reduce clogged pores, so it\u2019s great for oily skin. And avocado oil is rich in oleic acid and monounsaturated fats, which help it to penetrate into the hair shaft. Grave Before Shave, which is formulated with jojoba oil, also contains tea-tree oil, a common ingredient in dandruff shampoos because it soothes skin while clearing clogged pores. Arthur Iskhakov, master barber at Barbers Blueprint; beard-care expert Matt Benevento (who describes himself as a \u201cfaithfully bearded man\u201d); and Colorado-based plastic surgeon Dr. Manish Shah all recommend it for its solid but simple list of ingredients. The oil also comes in a variety of scents, including bay rum, sandalwood, and pine, a feature Iskhakov likes because \u201cthere is a scent for every man\u2019s preference.\u201d $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) overall beard oil\n\nHonest Amish Classic Beard Oil This oil from Honest Amish Man, which has jojoba and argan oils in it, comes recommended by Luca Blandi of Oscar Blandi salon, who says it\u2019s versatile enough to handle all hair types and has a pleasing \u201cmanly\u201d scent. It\u2019s also an oil that Strategist writer David Notis used when growing out his beard; he says it\u2019s \u201creally terrific,\u201d adding \u201cif you\u2019re concerned about synthetics and preservatives, the stuff is just a blend of different organic oils, avocado, pumpkin seed, sweet almond, and argan.\u201d $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest fast-absorbing beard oil\n\nBaxter of California Beard Oil Baxter of California\u2019s beard oil, which has avocado oil in it, comes recommended by Beightol and Shah. Beightol says it is part of what he calls the \u201cnext generation of beard oils\u201d because, instead of argan or jojoba oils, its \u201cprimary moisturizing ingredient is squalene \u2014 a water-based moisturizer that penetrates and absorbs quickly into the skin.\u201d Shah also likes that it includes squalene (which he says is one of his favorite moisturizers) in its formula of high-quality oils and antioxidants. $27 at Amazon Buy $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest woodsy-scented beard oil\n\nThe Bearded Bastard Man of the Woods Beard Oil Benevento told us that he uses Austin-based brand the Bearded Bastard\u2019s earthy-smelling beard oil (which gets its scent from essential oils of cedar, pine, and sandalwood) every day. \u201cEvery morning, I dampen my beard and carefully massage the beard oil into my facial hair and skin. I then use a beard comb to straighten and style my beard.\u201d On top of making his beard look and smell great, Benevento likes that this oil is \u201cmade with ethically sourced, all-natural ingredients,\u201d including grape-seed, argan, and jojoba oils. $35 at The Bearded Bastard Buy\n\nBest exfoliating beard oil\n\nReal Bearded Men 100% Natural Premium Beard Oil 1 oz - Dead Sea Salt with Hemp Barber Roderick Hampton of Miracle\u2019s barbershop in Brooklyn swears by this beard oil formulated with argan, hemp-seed, apricot kernel, and avocado oils. Shah is also a fan, noting it additionally includes Dead Sea salt, which he says gives the oil added \u201canti-infective and exfoliating\u201d properties. For men who suffer from ingrown beard hairs or facial-hair dandruff, this is a good choice. Hampton adds that it has a fresh, citrusy smell thanks to its unique blend of essential oils. $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest growth-enhancing beard oil\n\nRICH by Rick Ross Luxury Beard Oil Pedro, a master barber at Klippers Barbershop in New Jersey who goes by the nickname \u201cWolf of Broad Street\u201d (and declined to give his last name), recommends this oil from extremely good beard\u2013haver Rick Ross, saying \u201cyou can comb, brush, or pick it through your beard to distribute the product equally.\u201d This beard oil contains grape-seed and jojoba oils, and Shah, another fan, notes it also has linoleic acid, which he says \u201cis anti-inflammatory and especially helpful in beards of men of color who are more prone to ingrown beard hairs. A good beard oil like this one that keeps inflammation to a minimum should help reduce the incidence of ingrown hairs.\u201d It also contains castor oil, which Shah says has \u201canti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, and stimulates prostaglandins, which aids in hair growth.\u201d $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest combination beard-and-hair oil\n\nSEB MAN The Groom by Sebastian, Men's Hair & Beard Oil Blandi, who told us he\u2019s a fan of getting the most for your money, also recommends this beard-and-hair oil from professional grooming products line Sebastian. It contains argan, jojoba, and grape-seed oils, and on top of moisturizing and adding a healthy sheen to your beard, it will also help define its shape. But it\u2019s versatility doesn\u2019t stop there. Blandi adds that you can also use it in your hair for styling or added shine. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard oil for softening and smoothing\n\nAesop Shine Hair Oil Joseph Rosenfeld, a New York\u2013based personal stylist who says he\u2019s had a beard for going on ten years, told us Aesop Shine is his go-to beard oil. In addition to grape-seed and jojoba oils, it contains linoleic acid, an omega 6 fatty acid that Rosenfeld says helps the product penetrate the hair shaft and soften hairs while improving hydration. He adds that this consistently makes his beard look good without ever leaving any residue behind. \u201cI apply a few drops onto a small beard brush and then brush through to evenly distribute the oil.\u201d $33 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nOrganic Beard Oil and Beard Conditioner - Royal Beard Club Adam Rinn, the host of the annual Coney Island Beard and Mustache Competition, who told us he\u2019s had a beard on and off for most of his adult life, suggests Brooklyn-made Royal beard oil for its short list of ingredients: Moroccon argan oil, jojoba oil, and vitamin E. But he also likes it because it \u201cfeels good,\u201d and because it comes in an unscented version, for those who don\u2019t want a strong smell under their nose all day. (For those who do, Royal also sells its oil with various scents including what and what citrus, pine, and mint.) $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest oils for making your own beard oil\n\nIf you\u2019ve got the extra time on your hands and are brave enough to try making your own beard oil, DeAngelis recommends starting with a 50-50 combination of argan and jojoba oils, which he suggests buying in small quantities and combining in an empty glass bottle. Then, if you prefer something scented, he suggests playing around with different essential oils depending on if you like woody, earthy, or citrusy smells. Ideally, DeAngelis says you would visit Manhattan-based essential oil shop Enfleurage for a guided tour of scented oils that you can test on your skin. But if you can\u2019t make that trek, he says you can go to Whole Foods or your local health-food store and take a whiff of a few different oils, including tea-tree, lemon-eucalyptus, or a set of different woodsy scents.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
