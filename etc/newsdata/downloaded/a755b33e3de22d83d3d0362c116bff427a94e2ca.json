With five more said to have been identified by Hanoi police.\n\nThe authorities in he refrigerated trailer where 39 people were found dead in the early hours of Wednesday morning\n\nOfficials in Hanoi said today 28 Vietnamese families from two rural provinces have come forward fearing a loved one was among the victims who died in the refrigerated container that had travelled from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.\n\nGovernment sources said 18 of those reported missing came from Hghe An province while the other ten were from Ha Tinh, two poverty stricken areas less than 50 miles apart.\n\nEach of the families told authorities that their loved ones had been in contact up until October 21st when they were attempting to enter the UK illegally with the assistance of people smugglers.\n\nA telephone hotline has been set up for families to report a missing person and in the capital the British ambassador Gareth Ward has held meetings with Vietnamese officials to discuss cooperation in the identification of victims.\n\nA Vietnamese Government spokesman said the 14 names had been sent to the UK via the British Embassy in Hanoi.\n\nOver the weekend officials collected hair and nail samples from grieving families to be used in DNA analysis.\n\nFamilies also supplied photographs and descriptions of distinguished marks, such as moles or scars.\n\nWhile more than half a dozen families have spoken out about their anguish others have chosen to remain silent.\n\nPham Tra My, 26, was the first person named by family as among the 39 dead in the container tragedy and it appears she may have been deported from Britain days earlier\n\nThis is the last photo of 15-year-old Nguyen Huy Hung, who has been missing since he tried to cross illegally to Britain, his family claim\n\nNguyen Van Hung's shocked family have not heard from him since October 21st when he sent a message saying he was 'going by taxi' to the UK\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, and cousins Hung Nguyen, 33, and Hoang Van Tiep, 18, (pictured left to right) are all feared to be in the container\n\nCarpenter Le Van Ha, 30, father-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, and Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26, are also named by family as victims\n\nThe names supplied to Essex Police are thought to include the youngest victim, 15-year-old Ngyuen Huy Hung.\n\nFamily members said his parents were already in the UK and he was set to be reunited with them after a journey from his home in Ha Tinh province that had taken two month.\n\nPham Thi Tra My, 26, who sent a devastating text to her mother saying she was suffocating, was also thought to be among those whose details are now with Essex Police.\n\nHer father was among the first to send a letter to the local authorities saying his daughter was likely one of the 39 people found dead.\n\nThe death of so many Vietnamese people has caused embarrassment to the Government and local media have down played the tragedy in its news reports.\n\nForeign media were ordered to leave the homes of some victims and families told not to answer questions.\n\nThe victims were thought to have been carrying false Chinese passports - but the majority are understood to be from Vietnam\n\nThe terrible events of the past few days are but the latest example of the trade in \u2018human cargo\u2019 between China and Britain, a 5,000-mile route through Asia and mainland Europe that can take a month\n\nThe Ministry of Public Security has said it is investigating possible involvement of individuals or groups who help Vietnamese emigrate illegally.\n\nAnd the country\u2019s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered a probe into the trafficking of Vietnamese citizens.\n\nThe debt-ridden families of suspected victims in the Essex lorry tragedy are being intimidated by smuggling gangs, it has emerged.\n\nGrieving relatives in Vietnam are understood to have come under pressure not to speak out as authorities in the UK seek to find those responsible for the 39 deaths. Anti-trafficking experts last night warned that victims\u2019 relatives are being held ransom by \u2018highly sophisticated and organised\u2019 smuggling networks to whom they owe up to \u00a330,000.\n\nThe press was prevented from speaking to the family of one suspected victim in Vietnam.\n\nAfter wanting to discuss their child\u2019s disappearance, the family was ordered to keep quiet by men who escorted a reporter off the property \u2013 and locals believe they may be linked to smugglers.\n\nMo Robinson was in court yesterday accused of 39 counts of manslaughter, money laundering and people trafficking charges\n\nJoanna and Thomas Maher, arrested in connection with Essex lorry deaths because of historic links to the lorry. They have now been released on bail\n\nThe family of suspected victim Nguyen Dinh Luoung, 20, have told how they were contacted by a trafficker in France after the tragedy and promised that some of the \u00a311,000 smuggling fee would be returned.\n\nExperts said the tactic has likely been employed by gangs as leverage to ensure families do not speak to police about their operation.\n\nMichael Brosowski, head of anti-trafficking charity Blue Dragon in Hanoi, said families often borrow money from the smugglers and are then left facing years of repayments \u2013 while the victims of gangs can find themselves trafficked and effectively used as slaves to supposedly pay off the debt.\n\nDreams of a better life: Faces of the migrants feared dead in truck tragedy while trying to enter UK\n\nHoping for a better life, here are the faces of the 39 people who are believed to have frozen to death in the back of a truck after a desperate attempt to reach Britain.\n\nVietHome, a British organisation which tries to help UK-based Vietnamese residents, said it had been sent 20 photographs and names of people feared to have been inside the lorry container.\n\nEight suspected victims have so far come to light: Hung Nguyen, Anna Bui Thi Nhung, Nguyen Dinh Tu, Le Van Ha, Vo Ngoc Nam, Pham Thi Tra My, Joseph Nguyen Dinh Luong and Hoang Van Tiep.\n\nAll 39 people have been moved from Tilbury Docks to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford and are being formally identified.\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Vietnam paid an agent over $10,000 with the hope of entering the U.K.\n\nThe nail technician who paid \u00a38,800 to make it to Britain\n\nAnna Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Vietnam paid an agent over \u00a38,000 [$10,000] with the hope of entering the U.K. to work as a nail technician, according to a relative.\n\nHer mother and a sister today cried as they set up an altar with incense and a photo of the suspected victim where family and friends can pray at their home in Do Thanh village.\n\nThe family heard from a friend living in the UK that 'Nhung is one of the victims,' said one of her relatives, who was visiting the missing teen's mother.\n\nNhung and many others from Yen Thanh district, where the village is located, some 200 kilometers (120 miles) south of Hanoi, travel abroad looking to make the type of money they cannot earn back home. One of their main goals is to send back enough to allow their families to build large homes that they would otherwise be unable to afford.\n\nOn October 21, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged, Nhung wrote in a Facebook post: 'Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face.'\n\nA relative looks at an image of Nhung. The 19-year-old wanted to work as a nail technician, according to a relative\n\nNhung's family said she first left Nhung on her journey overseas in August. She went to China first, before eventually making her way to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she boarded the fated truck.\n\n'I just want a peaceful life,' Nhung wrote in a caption beneath a photo of her smiling in a green field a few weeks after leaving Vietnam.\n\nLate on Saturday night, Nhung's family, devoid of hope, set up an altar in her memory, with her photo next to her father's.\n\nHer father died of cancer a few years ago. Her mother was unable to work because of health complications and so her loved ones clubbed together to finance a new life overseas, Nhung's family said.\n\n'Nhung didn't have the qualifications to get a good job with handsome pay. Nor do her friends and many others here,' said Nhung's uncle, Hoang Binh.\n\n'Going abroad and sending back money was the only choice,' he added.\n\nBy early September, it was not clear where she was, but Nhung was already well into her trip, and reflecting on her next steps.\n\nBeside a stock image of two children flying kites at sunset, she posted: 'As I grow up, I see that life is not as peaceful as I used to think. When I grow up, I want to go back to my childhood, when I lived freely'.\n\nTon Quang Tuan, one of Nhung's friends living in Berlin, said that 'We went out a few times when Nhung was in Berlin' and added that 'she was in a good mood, very happy,' but they lost contact after she said she had to leave for Britain.\n\nIt was not clear how Nhung had travelled from the Vietnamese countryside to China and then Berlin, but the German capital has emerged in recent years as a staging ground for Vietnamese and other migrants looking to start new lives in Britain.\n\n'I feel lonely in the place I used to dream of everyday,' Nhung wrote on September 25.\n\nIt was unclear where she was - Vietnamese smugglers are said to advise their subjects to live discreetly and not to give away too many clues in order to evade detection from the authorities.\n\nA few days later, Nhung was pictured outside Berlin Cathedral with a cup of bubble tea in her hands.\n\nBy late October, Nhung was in Belgium. She posted photos of herself, again with a cup of bubble tea in her hand, excitedly exploring the sights of Brussels, including the old stock exchange and the bustling Rue Auguste Orts thoroughfare.\n\nIt was from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge that the doomed container eventually departed. Her family believe that she was on board.\n\nIn Berlin, Nhung wrote: 'Back in Vietnam, I thought Europe was pink. But it turns out it's black'.\n\n\n\nThe 'VIP' traveller who paid \u00a330,000 believing she would travel to Britain by plane and car and sent harrowing messages to her mother as she died in the back of a freezing lorry crossing the North Sea\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, from Vietnam sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed.\n\nThey claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'.\n\nShe is from Ha Tinh, an impoverished province in a part of Vietnam where many of the country's illegal migrants come from.\n\nNguyen Thi Phong and Pham Van Thin, told CNN it was 'very painful' to receive the text - saying she must have known she was going to die when she sent it.\n\n'I've lost both my loved one and my money,' her father Pham said, claiming he and his partner scraped together the money to pay for their daughter to travel to the UK.\n\nThe pair, who make around $400 a month between them, said the smugglers did not tell them how their daughter would be transported to the UK.\n\n'The smugglers said that this was a ... safe route, that people would go by airplane, car ... if I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,' Pham added.\n\nA human rights worker in Vietnam, who has spoken with Tra My's family, revealed she made the perilous journey because her family was in debt and she was desperately trying to help them.\n\nHer family claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'\n\n'She had just returned from Japan where she was working to try and pay off the debt. And that was not enough and so she looked for a better future,' she told the BBC.\n\nAsking to remain anonymous, the human rights worker continued: 'For this girl it is very sad that she took the risk because she was dealing with debt that was created by another man in the family.\n\n'And I also learnt that the service that she was using was called 'very important service' and so it is like a business class ticket on the lorry and with that she had to pay double or three times the price of the cheap ticket.'\n\nThe human rights worker added that migrants are told they can vast amounts of money by moving to the UK, and the 26-year-old may have been convinced to purchase a 'VIP ticket' to get there.\n\nHe family mortgaged the house to get that money for her, the human rights worked added.\n\nPham Thi Tra's last text messages were sent at 10.28pm BST on Tuesday - two hours before the truck reached the UK, as it was en route from Belgium.\n\nShe told her mother: 'I'm sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn't succeeded. Mum, I love you so much. I'm dying because I can't breathe.'\n\nTra My's brother told the BBC on Friday that his sister had told them not to contact her because 'the organisers' did not allow her to receive calls.\n\nHe said she flew to China from her home in Can L\u1ed9c, a rural district of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province in Vietnam, then left for France and initially attempted to cross the border into the UK on October 19, but 'got caught' and turned back.\n\nNguyen Dinh Luong, 20, pictured at Montmartre in Paris planned to work in a nail salon when he got to Britain\n\n20-year-old impoverished Vietnamese province with dreams of a better life in a British nail bar\n\nAnother of the suspected victims was revealed to be Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20.\n\nHis father Nguyen Dinh Gia said his son told him two weeks ago he planned to travel to Britain from France, where he had been living illegally since 2018.\n\nHe said he would pay \u00a310,000 [$14,000] for the journey and planned to work in a nail salon when he got to Britain.\n\nBut Gia got a call several days ago from a Vietnamese man saying 'Please have some sympathy, something unexpected happened,' he told AFP.\n\n'I fell to the ground when I heard that,' Gia told AFP.\n\n'It seemed that he was in the truck with the accident, all of them dead,' he added.\n\nHis father told The Associated Press he had not been able to reach him since last week. He had said he would join a group in Paris that was trying to reach England.\n\n'He often called home but I haven't been able to reach him since the last time we talked last week,' Nguyen Dinh Gia said. 'I told him that he could go to anywhere he wants as long as it's safe. He shouldn't worry about money, I'll take care of it.'\n\nHe said his son left home in central Ha Tinh province to work in Russia in 2017, then on to Ukraine. In April 2018, he arrived in Germany then traveled to France. He told his family that he wanted to go to the UK.\n\nLuong's older brother, Pham Dinh Hai, said that Luong had a tattoo of praying hands on a cross on his right shoulder. The family said they shared the information with local authorities. Luong is also from Ha Tinh.\n\nOne of the newly named suspected victims, Nguyen Dinh Tu\n\nThe ex-soldier who left his wife and young son at home\n\nOne of the newly named suspected victims, Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26, had a few months ago asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong to help him raise \u00a311,000 ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom.\n\nMs Hoang revealed he had been working illegally in Romania and Germany and had begged her for money to get to the UK.\n\n'I lost contact with him on October 21,' Thuong said with tears in her eyes. 'I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything'.\n\nTu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick him up.\n\n'They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but they called and said Tu was in that truck,' Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, said.\n\n'I haven't heard anything from my son'.\n\nTu had a few months ago asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong (pictured with her son) to help him raise \u00a311,000 ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom\n\nFather-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, is also feared to have been in the ill-fated container\n\nFather-of-two who called his family on day of tragedy asking them to pray for his safe journey to Britain\n\nFather-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, is also feared to have been in the ill-fated container.\n\nHis wife, Ta Thi Oanh, told Vietnamese media that he had called her last Tuesday afternoon to say he was on the truck going to Britain.\n\nHe asked her to call her parents and ask them to pray for him, but has not been heard of since.\n\nMr Nam's father, Vo Ngoc Luyen, said: 'After reading information about the 39 people in the container in the UK, my family is extremely shocked. We are anxiously waiting for official information from the authorities.'\n\nNam is believed to have travelled to Romania, before Germany and France, to find work. The local report described the family situation as 'difficult'.\n\nHoang Van Tiep, 18, (right) is feared to have died alongside his cousin in the container\n\nThe youngest to die: Victim believed his \u00a313,500 to traffickers would mean a taxi into Britain\n\nBelieved to be the youngest victim, Hoang Van Tiep, 18, is feared to have died with his cousin Hung Nguyen.\n\nTiep left home two years ago after his family got a \u00a313,500 loan to pay for him to travel to Russia and on to France.\n\nHe had left his family in Yen Thanh to risk his life getting into the UK.\n\nHis father Hoag said his teenager son had also told him that he would be travelling by taxi to the UK.
