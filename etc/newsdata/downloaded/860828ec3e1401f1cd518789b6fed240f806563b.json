Schiff (D-Calif.), who has become the face of the investigation, on Tuesday. He was talking about diplomat Gordon Sondland, who was blocked by the Trump administration from talking to the House hours before he was set to testify about his role in asking Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Democrats have signaled this warning that they\u2019re considering obstruction as a reason to impeach Trump last week, after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stopped State Department officials from testifying. One did \u2014 former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker \u2014 but only after he resigned from his post.\n\nBy the Constitution\u2019s standards, impeaching a president for not participating on an impeachment inquiry is A-okay. Congress gets to decide what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d in the impeachment clause are. If it decides blocking Congress from its oversight duties meets that requirement, then so be it. A similar article of impeachment was written up against President Richard M. Nixon and voted out of the House Judiciary Committee. In that article, the Judiciary Committee cited four times that the Nixon administration \u201cwillfully disobeyed\u201d subpoenas:\n\nARTICLE III, DEFIANCE OF SUBPOENAS. In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas\n\nSo Trump\u2019s impeachment could still continue if his administration won\u2019t provide documents or witnesses to the broader inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow it plays politically is another question. Democrats would be at risk of pursuing impeachment of a president without a comprehensive investigation of what he did. They won\u2019t have the benefit of making their case with public hearings, or by obtaining and releasing more private diplomatic texts. (Schiff said Sondland has related private texts or emails that the State Department may also block from coming to light.)\n\nBut maybe Democrats don\u2019t need to stretch to make their case. A new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows that a majority of Americans (58 percent) support an impeachment inquiry with the facts that are already out there. The country is still split on whether to impeach Trump, with 49 percent supporting it. But there is growing Republican support for impeachment: A notable 18 percent of Republicans support removing Trump from office. That\u2019s not nothing.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, there are early signs that pursuing an obstruction charge would be received the same way as impeachment for other stuff, like abuse of power. Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) is a newly elected member of Congress who flipped a district Trump won. She, along with other Democratic moderates, reluctantly supported an impeachment inquiry when the Trump administration wouldn\u2019t hand over the whistleblower complaint that started all this. It was the act of not cooperating that convinced her an inquiry was necessary.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd in front of reporters last week in her district in Allentown, Pa., Wild said any efforts to withhold documents would be considered an obstruction of the impeachment probe \u2014 and perhaps an impeachable offense in its own right. \u201cIf the administration stonewalls us and refuses to produce things, I would consider that to be an obstruction of justice, and, yes, I believe that would constitute additional grounds\u201d for impeachment, she said.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, there are a handful of House Republicans who have expressed some kind of endorsement of House Democrats\u2019 investigations into the whistleblower complaint. They don\u2019t support impeaching Trump, but they do seem amenable to the argument that Congress needs to stand up for its right to oversee the executive branch.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, if you don\u2019t believe in the processes of your own institution, what are you doing there?\u201d Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) told the New York Times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis isn\u2019t an ideal situation for House Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) supported the impeachment inquiry in part because the allegations Trump pressured a foreign country to help his reelection are easy to understand. She urged Democratic investigators to focus just on Ukraine. Now, they may have to shift to a broader, somewhat more esoteric focus: Congress\u2019s role as a separate and coequal branch of government. But it can be done.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nAD", "description": "Democrats are at risk of pursuing impeachment of a president without a comprehensive investigation of what he did.", "authors": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HRyyh7qiQEmRs7ODX3a96GQZ-98=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-08-2019/t_5f060e00ad994643b98561a5aa5740f8_name_20191008_Schiff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
