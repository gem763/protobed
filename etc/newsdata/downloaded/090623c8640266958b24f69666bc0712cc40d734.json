Ships have always aspired to glamour, especially when a famous \u201cgodmother\u201d is involved in order to bring luck and protection to the vessel (and yes, there might be complimentary sailings involved too). But 2019 has been a standout, especially when Scenic Eclipse was christened in New York on September 10 by Dame Helen Mirren.\n\nCunard delivered similar Oscar power to the seas in August, when Queen Mary 2 played host to director Steven Soderbergh and actor Meryl Streep, along with their film crew, on the ship\u2019s New York to Southampton trans-Atlantic crossing. They were shooting scenes for the movie Let Them All Talk and passengers so inclined had the option to appear as extras.\n\nHelen Mirren brought her Oscar-winning star power to the Scenic Eclipse's christening ceremony in New York in September 2019.\n\nAlso in the second half of this year, Viking Cruises was a natural partner for promoting the release of Downton Abbey the movie, given its long association with the owners of Highclere Castle, where the TV series was filmed.\n\nAnd of course, where do all good talk-show hosts eventually wash up but on the high seas. Over the past 18 months, passengers aboard Queen Mary 2 or Queen Victoria might have caught one of Sir Michael Parkinson\u2019s talks at sea \u2013 or bumped into him at the breakfast buffet.\n\nParky is becoming something of a regular on Cunard\u2019s queens, while his US counterpart Oprah Winfrey continues to cruise with Holland America Line in a nod to her eponymous magazine\u2019s partnership with HAL and her friendship with the line\u2019s global president, Orlando Ashford.\n\nThe Spa Suite aboard Scenic Eclipse.\n\nThe above godparents join a notable list, starting with the queen bee herself, Queen Elizabeth II, who has christened many ships, including Cunard\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II in 1967 and the Queen Elizabeth in 2010. Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s grandaughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, is godmother to Royal Princess, while Princess Charlene of Monaco has Seven Seas Explorer entrusted to her care.\n\nIn December last year, Celebrity Edge made headlines when activist and Nobel peace prize recipient, Malala Yousafzai, christened the ship in Miami. Other celebrity godmothers include Judi Dench (Carnival Legend) and Catherine Deneuve and Joan Collins (Uniworld\u2019s S.S. Catherine and S.S. Joie de Vivre respectively), while Sophia Loren has a staggering 14 ships under her watchful eye. Nor is Mirren entirely new to the task \u2013 in 2008, she christened P &O\u2019s Ventura.\n\nVisit Indonesia\u2019s Saparua Island with Coral Expeditions this Christmas.\n\nStaying with the red-carpet theme, Australian-owned Coral Expeditions\u2019 12-night Raja Ampat, Spice Islands & West Papua cruise, departing from Darwin on December 21, 2019, and following ancient trade routes, includes Christmas lunch with a king. Having established a strong tie with the Indonesian island of Saparua, Coral Expeditions has been welcomed back this year by the island\u2019s king to share \u201clunch and festivities with the village this Christmas\u201d.\n\nThe 68-page bumper Grand Journeys issue of Sophisticated Traveller is out on Friday, October 18 inside The Australian Financial Review.
