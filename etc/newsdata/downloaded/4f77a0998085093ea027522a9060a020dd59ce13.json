Mandatory Credit: Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNewton is hoping rest and rehab will keep him out of a procedure for a second time in 2019. He had shoulder surgery in January.\n\nNewton was sidelined after an 0-2 start during which he struggled with accuracy and did not run often. The injury by definition is displacement of the metatarsal bones, which often requires surgery and a lengthy recovery process that includes a hard cast for up to two months.\n\nNFL Network, seconding a report from Joseph Person in Charlotte, reported that Kyle Allen is likely to be the starter for several weeks. Allen threw four touchdown passes and guided the Panthers to their first win of the 2019 season on Sunday at Arizona.\n\n\u2014Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden told reporters that he isn\u2019t concerned about job security, one day after his team lost its third straight game to start the season.\n\nThe Redskins, who lost 31-15 to the Chicago Bears on Monday, visit the New York Giants (1-2) this weekend before hosting the New England Patriots (3-0) in Week 5.\n\nGruden, however, said he doesn\u2019t feel as though he is coaching on a week-to-week basis. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t felt like that. But who knows?\u201d the 52-year-old Gruden said.\n\n\u2014Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson told reporters he expects wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and tight end Dallas Goedert to play Thursday at Green Bay.\n\nHowever, Pederson said wideout DeSean Jackson is a \u201clittle further away\u201d and likely will not return from his core muscle injury until Week 5 against the New York Jets. Jeffery injured his calf against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2 and missed Sunday\u2019s loss to the Detroit Lions. He practiced in full on Tuesday.\n\nGoedert was hurt in Week 1 and dressed against Atlanta but did not play. He saw nine offensive snaps against the Lions, garnering one target, which he dropped in the end zone. Goedert was also a full participant in Tuesday\u2019s practice.\n\n\u2014The Minnesota Vikings re-signed former first-round pick Laquon Treadwell and placed fellow wide receiver Chad Beebe on injured reserve.\n\nTreadwell, selected by Minnesota with the 23rd overall pick of the 2016 NFL Draft, was cut by the Vikings on Aug. 31. The 24-year-old recorded 35 receptions for 302 yards and a touchdown in 2018.\n\nBeebe hurt his ankle in Minnesota\u2019s 34-14 win over the Oakland Raiders on Sunday. An MRI on Monday revealed torn ligaments in his ankle for the 25-year-old, who has two catches for 70 yards this season.\n\n\u2014Chicago Bears defensive tackle Akiem Hicks seemingly avoided significant injury to his right knee, head coach Matt Nagy told reporters.\n\nHicks left Monday night\u2019s win over the Redskins in the second half and was seen limping to the locker room alongside trainers. He had been wearing a soft wrap on the knee. Nagy was vague in postgame comments about Hicks\u2019 status, saying he was sore and adding \u201chopefully he\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nHicks, 29, has one sack and three QB hits through three games this season after totaling 7.5 and 16, respectively, in 2018 en route to his first Pro Bowl selection.\n\n\u2014Troy Aikman didn\u2019t take too kindly to an unfavorable comparison to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAfter The Athletic Kansas City tweeted \u201cICYMI: Patrick Mahomes has thrown 36% of Troy Aikman\u2019s career touchdowns, in about 8% of the games,\u201d the Pro Football Hall of Fame member and Fox Sports analyst was quick with a response on Twitter.\n\n\u201ciCYMI: Talk to me when when (sic) he has 33% of my Super Bowl Titles,\u201d Aikman, 52, wrote on Monday. Aikman won three Super Bowl rings during his 12-year career with the Dallas Cowboys. The six-time Pro Bowl selection threw for 32,942 yards with 165 touchdowns and 141 interceptions.\n\n\u2014The Tampa Bay Buccaneers placed quarterback Blaine Gabbert on injured reserve, a month after he dislocated his left (non-throwing) shoulder in a preseason game.\n\nGabbert was hurt Aug. 23 against the Cleveland Browns and has not practiced since, though he was kept on the 53-man roster for the first three weeks of the regular season. He will be eligible to be recalled from IR after Week 11, if the team chooses to do so.\n\nRyan Griffin has served as Jameis Winston\u2019s backup with Gabbert out.\n\n\u2014The New York Jets have reached a sponsorship agreement with 888casino NJ that will see the company\u2019s branding displayed throughout MetLife Stadium at home games.\n\nThe Jets signed MGM as the team\u2019s first official gaming partner last year.\n\n888 will become an official club sponsor, with the Jets appearing on the company\u2019s website. The gaming company will also able to use the Jets\u2019 logo and other branding in marketing materials and advertisements.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is dealing with a Lisfranc injury and could require surgery, per multiple reports Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433561297&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O01J-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
