Occasionally, the tips of the tallest standing stones have been visible as the reservoir\u2019s water levels have changed, but according to NASA, this is the first time that the entire monument has been out of water since the area was flooded to create the lake.\n\nWater levels in the reservoir dropped significantly this summer after two intense heat waves baked much of Europe. In Spain, June\u2019s hot spell saw seven weather stations record their highest temperatures ever, according to the country\u2019s meteorological agency, with several cities exceeding 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). Higher-than-average temperatures and dry conditions were also recorded across Spain in July and August.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Mach Science"], "top_image": ""}
