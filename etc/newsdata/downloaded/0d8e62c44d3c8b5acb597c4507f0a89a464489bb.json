Malware is stored as strings which are ASCII-encoded in the database. Once called upon by WhiteShadow, the payload will write to disk as a PKZip archive of a Windows executable.\n\n\"The SQLOLEDB connector is an installable database connector from Microsoft but is included by default in many (if not all) installations of Microsoft Office,\" the researchers say. \"Once the connector is installed on the system, it can be used by various parts of the Windows subsystem and by Visual Basic scripts including macros in Microsoft Office documents.\"\n\nCNET: Hackers set up a fake veteran-hiring website to infect victims with malware\n\nThe malicious payload is installed based on configuration settings stored in a script within the attachments.\n\nEarly campaign indicators revolve around Crimson, a malware family that has been connected to attacks against military and government outfits. The malware has information stealing functionality, is able to perform screen captures, list processes, and is able to harvest emails from Outlook.\n\nIt is not known if the latest Crimson spread is related to past campaigns.\n\nIn addition to Crimson, Proofpoint has also tracked the downloader being used to deliver malware including Nanocore, njRAT, AgentTesla, and Formbook.\n\nProofpoint says the Microsoft SQL technique is not unheard of, but it is a rarity in the wild. Currently, campaigns employing this method are small, but that does not mean they will remain so in the future.\n\nTechRepublic: Latest research says organizations need to integrate security principles with DevOps\n\nIn related news this week, Microsoft researchers discovered thousands of Windows PCs that have been infected with a new form of malware. Known as Nodersok or Divergent, the malware is distributed through malvertising and may either use infected hosts into relays for malicious proxies or to perform click-fraud.\n\nPrevious and related coverage\n\nHave a tip?
