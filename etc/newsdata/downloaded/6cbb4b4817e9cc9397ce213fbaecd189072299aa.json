The Deep State ferociously stabs with their steely knives, hoping to kill the beast of the president they have always hated. The Fourth Estate despises Trump more than they hated Nixon, which is hard to even imagine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe non-Never Trumper Republican establishment is royally pissed at the president\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds. The Never-Trumpers nod in unison, clucking in equal measure, \u201cI told you so\u201d while deeply intoning that the end is nigh.\n\nAnd worse, the president\u2019s top lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiRand Paul calls for probe of Democrats over Ukraine letter Sunday shows \u2014 Officials rush to Trump's defense on Syria, sanctions Cruz: 'Of course' it's not appropriate to ask China to investigate Bidens MORE, the one who used to hunt mobsters for a living, is hanging out with some mighty shady characters who could be the main characters in the next Robert De Niro movie.\n\nHow the hell is the president going to wiggle out of this one?\n\nIf it seems like a desperate situation, it is.\n\nBut don\u2019t count the president out.\n\nHere are a few reasons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFirst, the economy stubbornly stumbles forward. Many warn of a recession, hoping upon hope that a failing economy will finally sink the Trump regime. But there is an awful lot of stimulus in the system, from low federal taxes do a budget deal that generously spreads the money around to all kinds of government spending programs to a Federal Reserve that seem to be turning the monetary spigot back on, slowly but surely.\n\nDefeating an incumbent president during an economic expansion is awfully hard to do.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s a binary choice and the Democrats are pathetic.\n\nI mean that in the most positive way possible.\n\nJoe Biden Joe BidenTrump hits Fox News's Chris Wallace over Ukraine coverage Schiff: Whistleblower testimony might not be necessary Trump warns Democrats will lose House seats over impeachment MORE, the face of a political establishment that almost nobody outside of the Beltway is nostalgic for. Sure, he\u2019s a nice guy, but will he excite millennial Democrats to come out and vote for him? Doubtful.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders can gain ground by zeroing in on corruption Biden praises Buttigieg for criticizing GOP attacks: 'That's a good man' Warren enters crucial debate with big momentum MORE (D-Mass.), on the other hand, offers the kind of economic prescriptions that might have worked at the height of Great Depression, but today, with historically low unemployment, rising wages and a still expanding economy, she is singing the wrong song from the wrong hymnal.\n\nThese are the best two choices that the Democrats have and they are not very good.\n\nThird, despite all the impeachment chatter, Congress is poised to deliver some solid accomplishments for the president, despite the partisan acrimony.\n\nThere is universal agreement that a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada is likely to get done before Thanksgiving. A budget deal will eventually yield spending bills by the end of the year. A drug pricing bill is still a possibility. Other bipartisan health care bills, like surprise billing reform, are also possible.\n\nThere is a natural belief that because the House is focused so completely on impeachment that there is little chance of anything else getting done. But for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiBiden on impeachment: 'I'm the only reason' it's happening Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Rand Paul calls for probe of Democrats over Ukraine letter MORE (D-Calif.) to keep her majority, she needs solid accomplishments for her most vulnerable members who all live in Trump-winning districts.\n\nFinally, the president, despite his rocky relationship with the truth and his potty-mouth, has done one thing that binds him closely to his political base. He has done everything he can to keep faith with his campaign promises. He promised to change our trade relationship with China. He promised to clamp down on illegal immigration. He promised to pull our troops out of far-flung and dangerous places. He promised to smash the Washington status quo.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t achieved everything he promised. He hasn\u2019t built a wall and gotten Mexico pay for it. He hasn\u2019t repealed and replaced ObamaCare. He hasn\u2019t gotten a final peace deal with the Taliban.\n\nBut he hasn\u2019t given up on those promises and he hasn\u2019t conveniently forgotten about them either, hoping that the voters have forgotten about them too.\n\nThings look dark for the president and there are still some very stormy days in front of him. But it is always darkest before the dawn. He may be down, but he isn\u2019t out yet.", "description": "Chairman Mao famously said, \u201cit\u2019s always darkest before it goes totally black.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_101219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
