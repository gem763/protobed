The 1986 legislation marked the creation of the H-2A worker, and fundamentally shifted how farms in the United States operate.\n\nThree decades removed from the rollout of H-2A workers, the American agricultural system is a completely different beast than one might believe from the archaic messaging that is regularly peddled. President Donald Trump bombasts supporters with messages about America reaching some imagined, racist carrying capacity (\u201cWhat can we do? We can\u2019t handle any more,\u201d Trump told a group in April. \u201cOur country\u2019s full. You can\u2019t come in, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d). Meanwhile, farms across the country continue to apply for, and receive, more and more temporary seasonal workers\u2014the overwhelming majority of them hail from Mexico, that dreaded land of \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers, according to right-wing rhetoric.\n\n\n\nIn North Carolina, Latino workers make up roughly 90 percent of all farmworkers.\n\nIn the past decade alone, the H-2A program has tripled the number of workers being flown and bussed in to work American fields, with more than half landing in five agriculture-heavy states: Georgia, Florida, Washington, North Carolina, and California. Looking outside of the H-2A system, which farm owners have described as burdensome due to the program\u2019s required paperwork and few existing labor requirements, undocumented workers have been estimated by the USDA to constitute nearly half of the industry\u2019s entire workforce. In North Carolina, Latino workers make up roughly 90 percent of all farmworkers. And despite\u2014or, more likely, because of\u2014the fact that the entire industry would instantly crumble if this workforce was cut off, these workers are allotted even fewer rights than those who walked into the fields nearly a century ago.\n\nThe living conditions for many of these workers are unsafe and overcrowded. Their wages, while potentially reaching high hourly rates depending on their individual production rates, ultimately amount to paltry annual salaries when compared to the strenuous nature of their work. Agriculture easily owns the highest fatality rate among all American industries. And while groups like the Farm Labor Organizing Committee work diligently to provide union services and protections for these marginalized workers, even states with Democratic governors, like North Carolina\u2019s Roy Cooper, continue to sign union-busting laws into effect in order to stifle these efforts. As a result of an entire industry and government being lined up against them, just 2.1 percent of agricultural workers are part of a union\u2014a shame given this nation\u2019s history of grassroots-led fieldworkers unions, like the Farmer\u2019s Alliance or the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. And in the absence of effective advocacy, workers remain at the mercy of employers\u2019 attempts to squeeze out a higher profit margin: In March, a federal judge rejected an attempt by an agricultural employers association to further lower the wages of thousands of H-2A workers.\n\nThe USDA is currently run by Sonny Perdue, Trump\u2019s pick for Secretary of Agriculture. The former Republican governor of Georgia is openly hostile to accepting human-caused climate change as a fact. In 2014, writing in the National Review, he called it a \u201crunning joke.\u201d When pressed on this by Harvest Public Media in 2017, he doubled down on his stance, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t know definitively in my opinion what is causing climate change.\u201d So it should have come to nobody\u2019s surprise in June 2019 when Politico revealed that the USDA, under Perdue\u2019s command, buried dozens of in-house, peer-reviewed studies that sounded the alarm bells on the effects of rising carbon emissions. (The Senate cleared his nomination in 2017 by a vote of 87-11.)\n\n\n\nIf Sonny Perdue doesn\u2019t care about climate change as it wrecks the livelihood of white male American farm owners\u2014per USDA, there were 3.2 million white farmers and just 45,508 black farmers in 2017\u2014it\u2019s unlikely that he spends much time considering how climate change will affect Mexico or the Central American countries, where the industry he oversees get its labor.\n\nA big part of understanding \u201cthe American farmer\u201d is not confusing them with the ever-coveted American Rural Voter\u2122.\n\n\n\nTo get a grasp on modern American farmers as a voting bloc requires a grounding in the complex history of New Deal federal subsidy programs, the racism that defined those programs, the trade deals of the \u201980s and \u201990s that delivered a death blow to the once-dominant family-run business model, and the whiplash of consolidation that has defined farming the past 20 years. Of course, for politicians looking to cash in on low-hanging nostalgic talking points, none of that really matters.\n\nBecause more land is being worked by fewer farmers, these government payouts are increasingly landing in the pockets of the wealthy.\n\nIf the idea is to make Americans feel empathetic toward the profession that once, but no longer, propped up the nation\u2019s economy, one needs only to invoke sepia-toned memories of grandma and grandad sweating in the fields to make an honest living, of simpler times. Once that time is invoked, it\u2019s fairly easy to convince voters of all leanings and backgrounds that such a reality still exists on a nationwide scale and that the government should be giving it billions of dollars. The actual numbers, however, present a more jarring reality.\n\nAmerican employees in the agricultural industries make up just 1.4 percent of the U.S. workforce, and those numbers don\u2019t appear to be jumping anytime soon. A 2019 economic forecast study from the USDA showed that farm incomes, when adjusted for inflation, have dipped 33.5 percent since 2013; meanwhile, the government\u2019s direct subsidies (run through what is called the market facilitation program, which pays out taxpayer money to farmers to offset losses caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs) will have increased in 2019 from 2018 by 42.5 percent, to $19.5 billion. And because more land is being worked by fewer farmers, these government payouts are increasingly landing in the pockets of the wealthy\u2014on Thursday, the AP reported that the farms of West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, a Republican billionaire, received $125,000 in trade-war subsidies.\n\nThe days of New Deal Democrats extending good-faith payments to Midwestern and Southern families in hopes of building a strong working class and political coalition are gone. In their place is an industry that is increasingly being built atop exploited foreign labor, that ignores basic science, and which continues to absorb tremendous subsidy money distributed to relatively few people, and rarely the ones actually working the fields. This is how the USDA and American agriculture works. In order for farm owners and field workers to reform the business model and have a chance of confronting climate change challenges, someone\u2014voters, policymakers, the media, maybe even a president\u2014has to cut through the organized nostalgia and start dealing with today\u2019s farms as they actually are.", "description": "Climate change isn't the only reality the USDA's been slow to grapple with.", "authors": ["Nick Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/71ba81b186f655015210ac8db1c51e5488ab9a51.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
