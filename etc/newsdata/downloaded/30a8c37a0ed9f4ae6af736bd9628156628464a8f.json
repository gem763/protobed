BECAUSE OF HER ANXIETY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nAccording to BP\u2019s 2019 Statistical Review of World Energy, an energy economics publication, global carbon emissions grew about 2 percent in 2018 to 33,890.8 million metric tons, due primarily to increased demand for heating and cooling services.\n\nWhile U.S. carbon emissions also increased in 2018, the U.S. has been the world\u2019s leader in reducing carbon emissions for over a decade.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, carbon emissions in this country declined 14 percent between 2005 and 2017, \u201cmainly because more electricity has been generated from natural gas\u201d \u2013 a more efficient and \u201cless carbon-intensive fuel than either coal or petroleum.\u201d\n\nThe EIA is forecasting a 2.2 percent decline in U.S. carbon emissions in 2019 as natural gas continues to replace coal in generating electricity. Fortunately, we have natural gas in abundance, thanks to a private sector-developed extraction process known as fracking.\n\nFracking does release methane gas, but according to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s 2018 Greenhouse Gas Inventory, released in April 2019, U.S. methane emissions declined 15.8 percent between 1990 and 2017, while natural gas production increased by 51 percent.\n\nMore energy, less methane and carbon. Sounds like progress.\n\nNonetheless, virtually every Democratic presidential candidate who participated in CNN\u2019s recent seven-hour climate change marathon opposes fracking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, said she would \u201cban fracking \u2013 everywhere\u201d on her first day as president, a mandate that would undoubtedly increase our carbon emissions. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., never one to rigidly tether his policies to reality, would \u201cban fracking on all public and private lands.\u201d\n\nIn any event, reducing the world\u2019s carbon emissions is not something any American president alone can achieve. While U.S. emissions are significant and should be reduced, they constitute only 15.2 percent of the world\u2019s total.\n\nChina emitted 27.8 percent, or 9,428.7 million metric tons, of carbon in 2018. That\u2019s more than the U.S. (5,145.2 million) and the European Union (4,248.4 million) combined.\n\nTo reduce emissions we need plausible alternatives. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are currently incapable of meeting the world's energy demands on their own.\n\nAs respected environmentalist and former renewables advocate Michael Shallenberger explains in a piece in Quillette magazine titled \"Why Renewables Can\u2019t Save the Planet,\" both wind and solar currently lack the capacity to generate or store sufficient energy to meet global demand.\n\nHydroelectric and geothermal energy production are limited geographically. With current technology, renewables alone simply are not a viable alternative.\n\nInstead, Shallenberger has become an advocate of nuclear energy \u2013 a safe and inexpensive means of significantly reducing carbon emissions.\n\nNuclear energy already cleanly supplies over 10 percent of the world\u2019s electricity and, according to a February 2019 report from the World Nuclear Association, almost all reports \"on future energy supply from major organizations suggest an increasing role for nuclear power as an environmentally benign way of producing reliable electricity on a large scale.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s difficult to take anyone seriously who rails against increased carbon emissions but either refuses to consider nuclear power as part of the mix (Sanders), opposes building new reactors (former vice president Joe Biden), or declines to take a position on nuclear energy (Warren).\n\nClearly, certain Democrats are more determined to scare us into accepting socialism than in reducing carbon emissions. Otherwise, why reject effective solutions that we know will reduce \u2013 and are today reducing \u2013 carbon emissions without reversing the incredible progress we have made since the Industrial Revolution in reducing extreme poverty, hunger and infant mortality - increasing life expectancy and improving standards of living to the highest levels in human history.\n\nOpposing not only natural gas but also nuclear energy raises the question of what Democrats are actually trying to accomplish under the guise of climate change. There have been some clues.\n\nSaikat Chakrabarti, New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s former chief of staff, admitted in July that the true motivation behind the Green New Deal wasn\u2019t a \u201cclimate thing.\u201d It was \u201ca how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing,\u201d he said.\n\nThat helps explain why progressives are attempting to generate climate panic while opposing practical means for reducing carbon emissions. It also explains why they favor massive tax increases, excessively burdensome regulation and spending virtually incomprehensible sums on far less effective, if not ineffective, approaches.\n\nClearly, certain Democrats are more determined to scare us into accepting socialism than in reducing carbon emissions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOtherwise, why reject effective solutions that we know will reduce \u2013 and are today reducing \u2013 carbon emissions without reversing the incredible progress we have made since the Industrial Revolution in reducing extreme poverty, hunger and infant mortality -- increasing life expectancy and improving standards of living to the highest levels in human history.\n\nWe have the means to reduce carbon emissions without rendering ourselves subservient to a class of government elites, surrendering our freedoms, or destroying our economy \u2013 despite the left\u2019s continuing attempts to scare us into serfdom.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDY PUZDER", "description": "What are Democrats really trying to accomplish when they push for climate change?
