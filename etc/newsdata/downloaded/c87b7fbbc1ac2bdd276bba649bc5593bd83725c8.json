I think we can improve the team. That\u2019ll be the challenge: how can we improve the team?\n\n'We want to get better. We\u2019ll have a look at selection and pick the best 23 to get better next week. At this stage, I\u2019ll be looking to pick our best 23.\n\n\u2018Now, our best 23 may be different from your best 23. We are 15 points from three games. We are where we need to be and we haven\u2019t played to our best yet \u2014 which is good, because we\u2019ve got growth.\u2019\n\nThere could be injury-enforced changes after Billy Vunipola twisted his ankle on Saturday\n\nJones\u2019 cryptic answer suggests that he could use the Test as a chance to give more World Cup exposure to players like Lewis Ludlam, Joe Cokanasiga and Ruaridh McConnochie.\n\nThe match will be a battle for first place in Pool C, with the winner likely to face Australia, rather than Wales, in the last eight. \u2018The permutations don\u2019t concern me,\u2019 said the England coach.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones is likely to remain in Japan this week after being unable to find suitable flights to attend the funeral of his friend and former coach Jeff Sayle in Australia.", "description": "England are set to ring the changes for Saturday's clash with France having booked their place in the quarter-finals with a game to spare.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/22/19372090-0-image-a-53_1570396688181.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
