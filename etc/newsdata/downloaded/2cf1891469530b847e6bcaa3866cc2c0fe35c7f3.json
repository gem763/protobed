Sinai\u2019s School of Medicine and Icahn Stadium on Randall\u2019s Island \u2014 said heading south was \u201cnot an easy decision to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter spending my entire career in New York, while I certainly do not wish to retire, I\u2019ve decided that at this point in my life I\u2019d like to enjoy a warmer climate and a more casual pace year-round,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIcahn, 83, didn\u2019t offer any other explanation, but affluent New Yorkers have been fleeing to Florida to save money since President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Acts limited the federal deduction for state and local taxes to $10,000.\n\nIcahn formerly served as a Trump adviser on corporate regulatory reform, but resigned ahead of an August 2017 New Yorker article that detailed potential conflicts of interest involving his stake in an oil-refining company, CVR Energy.\n\nIcahn didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThis report originally appeared on NYPost.com.", "description": "Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is moving to Miami next year \u2014 and employees of his hedge fund who don\u2019t like it will be let go without any severance, The...", "authors": ["Josh Kosman"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GB453_icahn0_ZG_20180109171517.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
