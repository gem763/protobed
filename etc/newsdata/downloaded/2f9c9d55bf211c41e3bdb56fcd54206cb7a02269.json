For the better part of 20 years, I was pumping smoke into my body as a I commuted to college or hung out in any number of bars downtown. I tried everything short of hypnosis to quit, and failed every time. Until, that is, I saw a coworker vaping one day. Soon after, I was done. Vaping saved my life, and the lives of countless others. So imagine my disgust at seeing Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, along with governors across the country, and even the president, push banning flavored e-cigarettes, the single most effective tool for quitting smoking.\n\nThe first week of September was the 4-year anniversary of my last cigarette, on the day I was married. On that day, I was done; liberated by an alternative that, unlike everything else I tried, worked.\n\nHow bad was I? While attending college in Detroit it wasn\u2019t uncommon for me to collect bottles and cans to supplement my meager income. I\u2019d get $10 in returnables, buy a pack of smokes at a gas station and, while handing over the bill, say, \u201cAnd the rest on pump 7.\u201d\n\nAfter graduation and moving to Washington, DC, for my first job that required me to shower before work, I could afford my habit. So the days of paying with empty beer and pop cans were gone, but the habit remained.\n\nSmoking was my priority, peaking with 2 packs per day, and sometimes as many as 3, if I\u2019d gone out for drinks. Now I take a drag on my vape pen.\n\nGone is the smell, gone is the tar and the stained fingers, gone are cigarette hangovers only a heavy smoker understands. I can breathe again.\n\nThere was a time when I\u2019d get winded walking up a hill. Not to the point that I couldn\u2019t do it, but I\u2019d definitely huff more than anyone my age should have.\n\nSo why ban this miracle?\n\nGovernment officials says it\u2019s for the children. How many abusive and failed government policies have used this sentiment as cover?\n\n\u201cCompanies selling vaping products are using candy flavors to hook children on nicotine and misleading claims to promote the belief that these products are safe. That ends today,\u201d Governor Whitmer said when announcing her ban.\n\nThis is an insane justification. Medical marijuana is legal in many states, including Michigan. And I\u2019d be willing to say that children manage to get their hands on pot through family members with prescriptions and straw purchases. Are governors calling to close dispensaries? Of course not.\n\nYou can\u2019t drive down 8 Mile Road in Detroit without seeing them, neon lights glowing all hours of the day. If Ms. Whitmer were really concerned about kids, this would bother her. The government makes too much money off them to care. Which is the same of cigarettes. The government makes a huge chunk of change off them, and they don\u2019t enjoy seeing that gravy train derailed.\n\nYet, smoking, which costs all governments a fortune in medical and productivity costs, must be protected? Make no mistake about it, \u201cbig tobacco\u201d and government are who benefits from these bans.\n\nI\u2019ve never been a candy or fruit flavored vape user, I stick to tobacco flavored. I didn\u2019t smoke cotton candy or sticky buns, I smoked cigarettes. But I have friends who use all manner of flavors in their vape kits and pens. The flavor matters less than the fact that they\u2019ve quit the cancer sticks.\n\nThere are no guarantees in life. Quitting smoking does not mean you\u2019re in the clear. My father, a retired UAW worker, was a smoker until about 10 years ago. Cold turkey worked for him. He was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. They caught it very early, thankfully, and we\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll find out in a few weeks that his treatment worked.\n\nBut quitting smoking is the next best thing you can do for your lungs after not starting in the first place. For many of us, for all manner of stupid reasons, not starting isn\u2019t an option. Vaping, however, is. And despite what you\u2019ve heard, despite the hysteria, it works.\n\nWhy limit options for people desperate to quit what we know will kill them because others will break the law and provide that product to kids? Children will always get their hands on things we don\u2019t want them to have, it\u2019s up to parents and society to make sure we stop them when they do.\n\nSome vape companies like Juul are all in favor of regulations and bans, it makes it harder for new competitors to come into being. They don\u2019t care about people looking to quit smoking any more than politicians do. If they did they\u2019d offer a nicotine-free version of their product, since that\u2019s what they say \u201chooks\u201d the kids. Treat their product like a stop-smoking tool with step-downs nicotine levels to wean people off it. But like government when people quit, there\u2019s no money in it. They\u2019re either getting really bad advice or ignoring good advice by welcoming in government. If they truly dislike their product, perhaps they should stop making it?\n\nVaping saves lives. Bans are pure political posturing designed to make politicians look like leaders on a \u201cflavor of the month\u201d political issue. In a way, they are. By banning flavored e-cigarettes, they\u2019re condemning smokers to keep smoking, and ultimately \u201cleading\u201d them to an early grave.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "Growing up in Michigan, I fell into a habit many .09/17/2019 4:22:43AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/125/0c8d774c-5ad9-4c65-936c-d0cb04c12814.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
