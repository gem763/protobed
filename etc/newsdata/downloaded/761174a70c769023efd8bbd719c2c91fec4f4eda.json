Canadian peer Canopy Growth missed quarterly expectations in August, with revenue falling under the lowest analyst estimate.\n\nAurora previously forecast positive earnings would arrive in its fiscal fourth quarter. The cannabis producer's executive chairman now sees the metric turning positive in fiscal 2020, Reuters reported.\n\nWatch Aurora Cannabis trade live here.\n\nAurora Cannabis dropped as much as 10% on Thursday after posting disappointing earnings data and pushing its profitability goal into the next fiscal year.\n\nThe world's second-largest cannabis company posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue figures below analyst estimates, despite revising its forecast lower in August. The move mirrors Canopy Growth's August 15 earnings drop, as revenue landed below the lowest analyst estimate.\n\nHere are the key numbers (in Canadian dollars):\n\nAdjusted EBITDA loss: $11.7 million, versus the $5.6 million estimate\n\nNet revenue: $98.9 million, versus the $107.9 million estimate\n\nGross margin: 58%, versus the 60.7% estimate\n\nAurora executives also walked back previous predictions of profitability in 2019, pushing the goal to the next fiscal year. The company forecasted positive EBITDA for its fiscal fourth quarter at the start of 2019, but went on to omit the same time frame in an August news release, simply saying the company was \"on track\" to reach the goal in the future.\n\nThe Wednesday earnings report pulled further away from its original guidance, missing the forecasted metric and saying it expects adjusted EBITDA \"to continue to improve in the future.\" Aurora's chairman set a wider expectation for the next fiscal year, Reuters reported.\n\n\"We provided that guidance ... because we assumed there would be a more aggressive roll-out of retail outlets and if that was the case, we would have no problem reaching that milestone,\" executive chairman Michael Singer told Reuters. He added the company is \"very confident\" it will reach a form of profitability in the next fiscal year.\n\nRead more: GOLDMAN SACHS: The stampede out of stock-market favorites is a preview of more extreme moves to come.

The company should focus on improving its gross margin as similar Canadian cannabis companies have struggled in boosting the metric, he added.\n\nAurora has the largest position in the ETF's portfolio by market value, according to Bloomberg. The fund also holds peers Canopy Growth and Aphria.\n\nThe cannabis producer closed at $6.49 per share Wednesday, up about 31% year-to-date.\n\nAurora Cannabis has 11 \"buy\" ratings, six \"hold\" ratings, and one \"sell\" rating from analysts, with a consensus price target of $9.63, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:\n\nApple TV+ is 'no substitute' for Netflix and its stockpile of original programming, Bank of America says\n\nUS business owners plan to pull back on hiring and investing if the trade war continues, according to a new UBS survey\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS: The stampede out of stock-market favorites is a preview of more extreme moves to come.
