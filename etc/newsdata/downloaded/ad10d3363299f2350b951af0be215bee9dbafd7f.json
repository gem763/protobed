We have worked well together with Border Crossings being way down,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cCongratulations Kevin, on a job well done! I will be announcing the new Acting Secretary next week. Many wonderful candidates!\u201d\n\nIn a statement of his own, McAleenan thanked Trump for the opportunity to serve at DHS. \u201cWith his support, over the last 6 months, we have made tremendous progress mitigating the border security and humanitarian crisis we faced this year,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to CNN, McAleenan submitted his resignation on Friday despite some White House officials attempting to talk him out of it. His exit comes just a few weeks after he vented frustrations in an interview with The Washington Post, saying it has been \u201cuncomfortable\u201d to lead the agency when he has no control over \u201cthe tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time.\u201d\n\nMcAleenan, who took over the position in April after Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted, was never nominated by Trump to permanently serve as DHS chief. Despite winning praise within the administration for expediting the construction of border barriers along the southern border and playing a key role in the Trump administration\u2019s controversial family separation policy\u2014which he later conceded \u201cwent too far\u201d\u2014McAleenan has largely been seen as a figure who never really blended into Trumpworld.\n\nLess than a week before his resignation, he was heckled and shouted down while speaking at an event at Georgetown University. Protesters held up signs reading, \u201cHate is not normal,\u201d and shouted the names of migrant children who died in U.S. government custody. McAleenan left the event without finishing his speech.", "description": "President Trump announced on Twitter that McAleenan wants to \u201cspend more time with his family and go to the private sector.\u201d", "authors": ["Julia Arciga"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2683,w_4771,x_0,y_591/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570838350/GettyImages-1176614695_gol8yw", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
