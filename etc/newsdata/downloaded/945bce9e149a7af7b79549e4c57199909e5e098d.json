A bipartisan group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories, led by Texas, have joined in the Google probe, which was announced Monday.\n\nThe Facebook investigation was confirmed Friday by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading that effort.\n\nFederal antitrust enforcers are also looking at Google and Facebook, as well as Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.\n\nIf a case results from any of those avenues, as many experts predict, it will take antitrust enforcement into uncharted, digital-age territory. Courts haven\u2019t seen a major monopolization case since the Justice Department sued Microsoft Corp. two decades ago.\n\nLarge Slice Big tech companies enjoy large market shares: Internet search World-wide, Aug. 2019 Online commerce U.S. , May 2019 92% Google 38% Amazon Mobile operating systems World-wide, Aug. 2019 Other 2% Apple iOS 22% 76% Google Android Net digital ad revenue* U.S., Feb. 2019 Other 25% 37% Google\u2020 Verizon 3% Microsoft 4% 22% Facebook\u2021 Amazon 9%\n\nFederal antitrust laws are broadly written, giving the government flexibility to apply them to new forms of monopolistic conduct as the economic landscape evolves. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, for example, outlaws monopolization and \u201cevery contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade\u201d that is considered unreasonable.\n\nHere is a look at arguments that antitrust enforcers could make, and the companies\u2019 potential rejoinders, based on testimony before Congress and the FTC, interviews with antitrust scholars and people familiar with the government\u2019s preliminary investigations.\n\nThe Potential Case Against Google\n\n\u2022That Google has used its dominance in online search to solidify its dominance in internet advertising, creating an unfair advantage over publishers and rival tech firms that sell and place ads online.\n\nGoogle, thanks in part to acquisitions of potential rivals such as DoubleClick, has come to dominate software tools at every layer between online advertisers and websites, including the main tech platform that connects buyers and sellers of display ads, this argument goes.\n\nThat middleman status has given it great power, especially because no one else has anything like the data Google possesses on publishers, advertisers and what consumers search for.\n\nAdvertisers are boosting their spending on digital ads, but much of the money goes to Google and Facebook, not publishers, whose ad revenues continue to decline. (News Corp, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, is among those raising objections.)\n\n\u2022That Google won or maintained its huge market share of online ad sales by excluding others that could have competed, including through contractual terms that make it harder for advertisers and publishers to work with other ad businesses that want to compete with Google.\n\nAdvertisers feel they must use Google\u2019s products, rather than tools from other companies, according to this argument. And in 2016, Google began requiring that advertisers use its tools to buy ads on its YouTube channel, which has by far the biggest audience for online videos.\n\nParticipants in a Google conference for software developers in May pose in front of the event\u2019s logo in Mountain View, Calif.

One recent study said that less than half of the mobile and desktop searches on Google result in a user clicking through to a non-Google site.\n\nThe EU also imposed a $5 billion fine on Google for requiring smartphone makers using Google\u2019s market-leading Android operating system to pre-install Google\u2019s search app and its Chrome browser on their devices.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Defense\n\n\u2022Google has an enviable place in online advertising, but it doesn\u2019t have monopolistic pricing power.\n\nGoogle competes with other big tech companies including Facebook and Amazon for ad dollars, and weak demand for old advertising models\u2014not its role in the ad-tech machinery\u2014is the reason publishers haven\u2019t reaped more of a windfall from digital ads.\n\n\u2022Google\u2019s actions are geared toward goals like giving users the information they want, as quickly as possible. Sometimes that means directing consumers to Google sites and services, the company says.\n\nSupreme Court precedent states that companies such as Google generally have no duty to assist in promoting a rival. In a 2004 ruling, the high court threw out antitrust allegations that Verizon Communications Inc. provided insufficient service to rival telecom companies using its phone lines.\n\n\u2022Many of Google\u2019s services are free to the public, with consumers effectively paying with the personal data they generate.\n\nJudges may face challenges assessing the nontraditional products that companies like Google and Facebook offer. \u201cIt\u2019s not like having 90% of the market for toothpaste,\u201d said Cleveland State University law professor Christopher Sagers.\n\nThe Potential Case Against Facebook\n\n\u2022That Facebook has achieved and maintained its dominance through a pattern of acquiring upstart firms that had become competitive threats.\n\nOf the roughly 90 companies Facebook bought in 15 years, two stand out as rivals that could have risen to challenge Facebook: Instagram, the world\u2019s largest photo-sharing service (2012), and WhatsApp, the largest instant-messaging app (2014).\n\nWhile antitrust enforcers believe it is illegal for a company to buy startups for the purpose of killing emerging rivals, neither the FTC nor Justice Department has brought such a case after the fact.\n\nAttendees at a Facebook developers conference in San Jose, Calif., in April.

(From 2005-2011, MySpace was owned by News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal.)\n\nThen, as Facebook became the dominant social-media platform, it didn\u2019t always honor those privacy pledges. The FTC levied a record $5 billion fine against Facebook this year for privacy violations.\n\nUnder the Sherman Act, it is illegal for a company to acquire monopoly power by engaging in conduct beyond \u201ccompetition on the merits.\u201d\n\n\u2022That Facebook abused its market dominance to effectively require consumers to allow tracking of their internet usage and exclude competitors in online advertising.\n\nFacebook, the argument goes, can exploit its dominance to persuade consumers to accept terms allowing the company\u2019s use of their personal data that they would reject if there were a truly competitive social media platform available.\n\nThis allegation led Germany last year to order Facebook to stop tracking user\u2019s web information without consent, though the company recently won a favorable appellate ruling. The litigation is ongoing.\n\n\u2022Facebook leverages the power of its data by sharing it with strategic partners while cutting off access to hobble potential competitors, such as Twitter Inc.\u2019s Vine, a video app that is now closed, the claim goes.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Defense\n\n\u2022Facebook says it doesn\u2019t have monopoly power and faces numerous rivals, including Twitter, Snapchat, Apple, Pinterest , Microsoft\u2019s Skype, Google and Amazon.\n\nFacebook\u2019s public policy director, Matt Perault, testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing in July. Photo: Patrick Semansky/Associated Press\n\nCompetition is vigorous because \u201cbarriers to entry for digital platforms are low,\u201d said Matt Perault, public policy director of Facebook, testifying before Congress.\n\nThe company also faces growing competition for its members\u2019 time: \u201cUsers increasingly spread their time between more and more services,\u201d Mr. Perault said.\n\n\u2022Facebook has acquired companies that have complementary strengths to make its social-media platform a better experience for consumers\u2014and not with the intent of putting a competitor out of business.\n\nAlso, Facebook likely would argue that the companies it bought wouldn\u2019t have grown to the same extent without Facebook\u2019s investment and know-how.\n\nThe Potential Case Against Amazon\n\n\u2022That Amazon\u2019s rise\u2014and the tactics that facilitated it\u2014have squeezed suppliers and harmed rival sellers, creating different types of disadvantages for consumers, such as lower product quality and reduced innovation.\n\nAmazon sells not only its own products, but also is a dominant platform for non-Amazon, third-party sellers. Those vendors now account for more than half of the company\u2019s global sales, and the platform is crucial to their survival.\n\nThird-party sellers say Amazon imposes fees and terms that the company couldn\u2019t sustain if it faced a real online competitor, and benefits from an omniscient view of these companies\u2019 sales data and customer relationships.\n\n\u201cIt would be as if Walmart owned our malls and Main Streets, decided which firms could operate in these spaces and on what terms, and surveilled every move they made,\u201d Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an advocacy group for independent businesses, said in recent congressional testimony.\n\nA study published by Harvard University found that Amazon used its data to identify independent sellers\u2019 best-selling products and then introduce its own version. The Amazon brand often then became the default search option on the platform, the study found.\n\n\u2022That Amazon\u2019s tactics can lead to higher prices on other websites.\n\nSome vendors that could sell their products more cheaply elsewhere, thanks to fees lower than Amazon\u2019s, say they are fearful of doing so.\n\n\u201cIf we sell our products for less on channels outside Amazon and Amazon detects this, our products will not appear as prominently in search,\u201d toy vendor Molson Hart, who has spoken with the FTC, wrote in a post on Medium in July.\n\n\u2022That Amazon has limited competition by removing some vendors from its site.\n\nAfter Amazon reached a deal to allow Apple to sell iPads, iPhones and other devices on Amazon, third-party vendors who sold refurbished Apple products say they were removed.\n\n\u201cI was doing 40 to 50% of business on Amazon,\u201d said John Bumstead, a reseller of refurbished MacBooks who said he was kicked off Amazon and spoke to the FTC in July. \u201cThat chunk of business evaporates.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s Defense\n\n\u2022Amazon\u2019s growth has been fueled by a determination to offer consumers low prices and it has competed fairly and legally against rivals.\n\nNate Sutton, associate general counsel for Amazon.com, at a House Judiciary subcommittee in July. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\n\nThe company has invested in supporting third-party sellers and wants them to succeed. That approach has benefited consumers \u201cin the form of competitive pricing, great selection and unprecedented convenience,\u201d Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton told a House antitrust subcommittee in July.\n\nAmazon also is far from a retail monopoly, Mr. Sutton said, because 90% of U.S. retail sales still take place in bricks-and-mortar stores. Amazon says it doesn\u2019t use seller-specific data in creating its own private-label products, and offers fewer private-label goods than many of its retail competitors.\n\nThe Potential Case Against Apple\n\n\u2022That Apple has used its platform for iPhone apps to favor its own products and services over rival offerings.\n\nA Wall Street Journal analysis published in July found that in the Apple App Store, Apple\u2019s own mobile apps routinely appear first in search results ahead of competitors\u2019.\n\nMusic streaming service Spotify has complained to U.S. antitrust authorities and filed a complaint with the EU\u2019s antitrust arm claiming Apple made it difficult for rival subscription services to sell to users without using Apple\u2019s payment system, which generally takes a 30% cut of transactions.\n\n\u2022That the company charged inflated prices in its App Store because iPhone users are prohibited from buying apps elsewhere.\n\nThis requirement prompted a private antitrust suit that was given the green light to proceed by the Supreme Court. Consumers are stuck with the company\u2019s terms because it is expensive to switch to a rival device, this argument goes.\n\nApple\u2019s Defense\n\n\u2022Apple doesn\u2019t have a monopoly in anything\u2014iPhones have less than a 50% market share in the U.S.\n\n\u2022Apple says its closed platform protects consumers\u2019 data. By requiring iPhone users to buy exclusively from Apple\u2019s store, Apple ensures the software is safe and won\u2019t compromise users\u2019 iPhones with viruses or spyware.\n\nAnd if Apple favoritism has crippled rivals, then why have consumers downloaded Spotify 300 million times in the App Store?\n\n\u2022Apple is under no significant legal requirement to give competitors a leg up.\n\nApple gave reporters a preview of its new store inside the historic Carnegie Library in Washington, D.C., in May. Photo: eva hambach/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\n\u201cEven if, as Spotify alleges, Apple has monopoly power and has suppressed competition in its App Store, the government would still have a difficult time making a case under current doctrine as interpreted by some courts,\u201d said former FTC lawyer Michael Kades, a director of competition policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.\n\nStill, Apple has run afoul of antitrust authorities before. In 2012, the Justice Department sued the company for conspiring with publishers to raise the price of e-books. Courts ruled Apple\u2019s actions were anticompetitive, and the company was ultimately compelled to pay $450 million.\n\n\u2014Ryan Tracy contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "description": "Are big technology companies using monopoly power to extend their dominance over the digital marketplace?
