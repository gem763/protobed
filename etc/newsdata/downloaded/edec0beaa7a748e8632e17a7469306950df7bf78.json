I found that out today when he told me.\u201d\n\nWoods and everyone else laughed, which captured the lighthearted day at the Narashino Country Club, where the made-for-TV skins game finished under floodlights on the 17th and 18th holes.\n\n\u201cFirst time I\u2019ve ever finished under lights, so that was exciting,\u201d Day said, surprised the sun goes down about 5 p.m. in the fall in the Tokyo area.\n\nDay won eight skins and $210,000. Woods had five skins and $60,000 with McIlroy taking four and winning $60,000. Matsuyama won only one skin and $20,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed I had only one,\u201d Matsuyama said, speaking through an interpreter and also getting a laugh.\n\nIt was Woods\u2019 first event after surgery two months ago, the fifth on his left knee. He\u2019ll get a stiffer test at the Zozo Championship that opens Thursday - the first-ever full PGA Tour event in Japan.\n\nWood said it was great \u201cjust being able to compete again. I haven\u2019t done this in a little bit now.\u201d\n\nBy his own assessment, he started very slowly.\n\n\u201cI did not play well at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI hit a lot of bad shots and did not putt well. Once I got into the flow of competing and feeling the round, it just got exciting. We were competitive, the banter was great, the back and forth.\u201d\n\nWoods, who had a hand in organizing the event, said he hoped \u201cwe were entertaining everyone and everyone who\u2019s watching had a good time.\u201d\n\nThey probably did.\n\nOn No. 4, Woods seemed to try to take advantage of the fact the Narashino Country Club has two greens on every hole. It\u2019s a tradition at some courses in Japan, alternating greens to keep them both in good shape.\n\nWoods hit a shot between two greens and Day got on him.\n\n\u201cI asked him (Tiger) to let me know which green he was going for,\u201d Day said. \u201cBut he was in between so I still don\u2019t know which one he was going for.\u201d\n\nWoods agreed.\n\n\u201cI hit in between the greens, so it looked kind of like I kind of didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth greens at No. 4 will be used this week at the tournament. A hole will be cut in each and players will choose which to play to.\n\nThe Narashino club is located about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Tokyo in Chiba prefecture. The course for next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics will be at Kasumigaseki Country Club in neighboring Saitama prefecture.\n\nFour famous rugby players really got the match moving at No. 7 when they paired up with the pros for one hole.\n\nMatsuyama dropped a 35-foot putt for birdie, and then was embraced by his teammate - former South African rugby player Bryan Habana. The 100-kilogram (220-pound) Habana almost crushed Mastuyama as he screamed: \u201cThat\u2019s my partner.\u201d\n\nSeconds later, former Ireland rugby player Brian O\u2019Driscoll holed another long putt, matching Matsuyama\u2019s birdie. Jason Day then holed another shorter birdie putt.\n\nWalking one fairway, McIlroy was asked by a TV interviewer about comments by Brooks Koepka about the Irishman\u2019s game.\n\nKoepka said last week: \u201cRory hasn\u2019t won a major since I\u2019ve been on tour, so I don\u2019t view it as a rivalry.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy last won a major in 2014 at the PGA Championship.\n\nMcIlroy said Koepka \u201cwasn\u2019t wrong. He\u2019s been the best player in the world for the last couple of years. Four majors. I don\u2019t think he needed to remind me I haven\u2019t won in a while. And I love Brooks. He\u2019s a great guy; obviously super-competitive like we all are. I can see where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy then paused and also added: \u201cI think that\u2019s good for the game, and I think if you take what Brooks said out of context - then it can become this big thing it\u2019s become. Brooks and I are good. We\u2019re good friends.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Not only did Jason Day win the inaugural \"The Challenge: Japan Skins\" game on Monday, beating Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Hideki Matsuyama, he also won the needling contest.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Wade"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/japan_skins_golf_76740_c0-123-3381-2095_s1200x700.jpg?4682a4d2240052656d121fa0bd90319f3f9aea82", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
