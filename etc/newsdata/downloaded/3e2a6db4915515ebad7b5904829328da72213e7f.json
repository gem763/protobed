Among viewers in the crucial demographic ages 25 to 54 that\u2019s coveted by advertisers, the drop was a heart-stopping 25 percent.\n\nThe slide has steadily accelerated during the past month, with weekly ratings in the key age group falling between 20 and 29 percent versus a year ago. That\u2019s far steeper than the single-digit drops during the year-and-a-half tenure of her predecessor Jeff Glor, who was pulling down $2 million a year, according to a source.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely unusual,\u201d said television analyst Andrew Tyndall. \u201cI don\u2019t see any prospects of \u2018CBS Evening News\u2019 getting out of third place, but an honorable third versus a dismal third is possible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a troubling sign for CBS, whose evening newscast has been stuck in third place since the tail end of Dan Rather\u2019s tenure, which ended in controversy over his reporting about President George W. Bush\u2019s military service.\n\nAsked about the decline, CBS sent The Post a statement from Zirinsky, saying the network is \u201cextremely pleased with how quickly the \u2018CBS Evening News\u2019 with Norah O\u2019Donnell has established itself as a must-see destination for exclusive reporting and investigative journalism. We\u2019re just getting started \u2014 ratings are not the sole measure at this time.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, all three nightly newscasts have gotten slammed as viewers increasingly defect to the web. In the 2018-19 season, ABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d with David Muir came in first place, slipping 0.3 percent as it attracted 8.6 million viewers. On NBC \u201cNightly News,\u201d Lester Holt\u2019s total viewers fell 2.6 percent to 7.9 million, although he led the 25-to-54 group with 1.7 million.\n\nBut CBS\u2019 dismal 2018-19 decline \u2014 in which its overall viewership sank 6 percent to 5.8 million through the middle of last month \u2014 has only worsened with the arrival of O\u2019Donnell.\n\nIn a splashy July 15 debut tied to the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, O\u2019Donnell interviewed Caroline Kennedy about her father, and Jeff Bezos about his space exploration ambitions. The show came in last place, with ratings off 5 percent from a year earlier.\n\nLate last month, she bagged an interview with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, in which he accepted responsibility for the killing of journalist Jamal Khash\u00adoggi, but denied ordering the murder. It aired, however, on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d not on her newscast.\n\nA source close to CBS said top brass are giving the fresh-faced 45-year-old time to acclimate. They \u201cdidn\u2019t think Glor could win,\u201d and had a \u201cstrong belief she was the best they had for the job,\u201d the source said.\n\nBackers cite O\u2019Donnell\u2019s strong DC connections from her tenure as a White House correspondent, her experience reporting around the world and the fact that she \u201creads off the teleprompter well,\u201d the source said.\n\nNevertheless, critics say CBS executives have botched the transition, failing to launch O\u2019Donnell\u2019s tenure with a major publicity campaign or slogan. The network has pledged to move O\u2019Donnell to Washington \u2014 the first time a major news network has anchored its broadcast outside New York since the 1970s. But the timing has been vague.\n\n\u201cWhen she took over, they deliberately did what they do in the restaurant business \u2014 a soft open,\u201d said Tyndall. \u201cThey said, \u2018We are going to move her show to Washington, DC, but not yet. We are giving her a new producer, but not yet.\u2019\u201d\n\nsee also Drew Barrymore is getting her own daytime talk show CBS Television Distribution is moving ahead with a syndicated daytime...\n\nO\u2019Donnell just landed a new executive producer in Jay Shaylor, who decamped from CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\u201d But insiders note ratings for Blitzer\u2019s show haven\u2019t been good, either.\n\nFormer TV executive Preston Beckman says viewers may be switching off O\u2019Donnell because they are looking for \u201csomeone with more gravitas.\u201d While she has decades of experience in the field, she\u2019s green when it comes to anchoring a news desk, he said.\n\n\u201cA news anchor is different than a reporter,\u201d Beckman said.\n\nAnother key factor: O\u2019Donnell is broadcasting to an American public which, with the exception of Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric, has scant experience with female nightly news anchors since the start of TV.\n\n\u201cThe obvious answer is she\u2019s a woman,\u201d Beckman said.\n\nTyndall, for his part, believes O\u2019Donnell is \u201ctrying too hard.\u201d He cited last Monday\u2019s broadcast on gymnast Simone Biles and two other female athletes who won competitions over the weekend.\n\nThe segment was \u201cintroduced by a gushing\u201d O\u2019Donnell, who branded the segment \u201cthree stories of triumph,\u201d calling them \u201cso incredibly powerful.\u201d", "description": "In the last week alone, O\u2019Donnell\u2019s total viewers plunged 17 percent to 5.1 million, according to Nielsen.", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/norah-odonnell-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
