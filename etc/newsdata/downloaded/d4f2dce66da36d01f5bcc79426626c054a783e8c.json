What\u2019s more, these transcripts could be reviewed by employees and contractors.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nEarlier this year, the iPhone maker drew ire for its so-called practice of grading, which involves employing human contractors to listen to a select sample of audio clips \u2014 that may or may not contain sensitive information \u2014 in an attempt to gauge its responses to Siri requests.\n\nThe fact that a third-party, let alone independent contractors, were actually listening to snippets containing \u201cmedical information, drug deals, and recordings of couples having sex\u201d set off a huge privacy concern.\n\nAs a consequence, Apple halted its grading efforts back in August, while promising to offer a privacy-focused way for users who consent to handing over their voice data for the product improvement program. The opt-in is meant to address these issues.\n\nWelcome updates that can be improved\n\nThese updates are long overdue, but in its current form there\u2019s no way to know which of your Siri recordings may have been saved for review by employees \u2014 assuming you have consented to giving your recordings to Apple to help improve Siri.\n\nThis is something users should have explicit control over, as is the option to manually review and delete commands that they don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing with Apple.\n\nIt\u2019s a widely accepted fact that netizens have to give up some level of privacy as the cost of admission for all the conveniences of the digital world. But transparency goes a long way in easing some of the concerns associated with such data collection practices.\n\nApple has long put itself up on a privacy pedestal, demanding to be treated unlike its data-hungry rivals. Now, more than ever, the company needs to match the values it puts forward.", "description": "Apple has officially begun testing a feature that allows users to explicitly opt out of sharing audio snippets to improve its Siri voice assistant.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F05%2Fapple-iphone-hed.png&signature=98be9cd2fb88ce901e718e6809bd3025", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
