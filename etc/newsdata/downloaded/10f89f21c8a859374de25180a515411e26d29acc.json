Kaelin, Jr, Peter J. Ratcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza for their discoveries of \"how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability,\" the Nobel Committee announced Monday.\n\nThe discoveries made by the three men \"have fundamental importance for physiology and have paved the way for promising new strategies to fight anemia, cancer and many other diseases,\" said the Karolinska Institute.\n\nThe trio \u2014 Kaelin and Semenza are Americans, and Ratcliffe is British \u2014 will share equally the 9 million kronor ($918,000) cash award. It is the 110th prize in the category that has been awarded since 1901.\n\nKaelin works at Harvard, Semenza at Johns Hopkins University and Ratcliffe is at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain.\n\nIn announcing the prize, the Nobel Committee said the work by the three laureates has \"greatly expanded our knowledge of how physiological response makes life possible.\" The Committee said that Semenza, Ratcliffe and Kaelin found \"the molecular switch for how to adapt\" when oxygen levels in the body vary, noting that the most fundamental job for cells is to convert oxygen to food and that cells and tissues constantly experience changes in oxygen availability.\n\nThomas Perlmann, the secretary of the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, said he was able to call all three laureates Monday. But he reached Kaelin via his sister who gave him two phone numbers \u2014 the first one was a wrong number.\n\n\"He was really happy,\" Perlmann told a news conference.\n\nThe announcement kicked off Nobel week. The Nobel Physics prize is handed out Tuesday and the following day is the chemistry prize.\n\nThis year's double-header Literature Prizes \u2014 one each for 2018 and 2019 \u2014 will be awarded Thursday and the Peace Prize will be announced on Friday.\n\nThe economics prize will be awarded on Oct. 14.", "description": "The three scientists found \"the molecular switch for how to adapt\" when oxygen levels in the body vary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4214800/1000x563_nbc-191007-nobel-medicine-mc-1147_80e37318b0fc5ea88b572bf8a39b9444.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
