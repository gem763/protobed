Pharmaceutical companies that refuse to negotiate could face steep penalties. Additionally, drugmakers that hike prices beyond inflation would have to pay rebates to Medicare.\n\nThe plan would limit copays for seniors covered by Medicare\u2019s \u201cPart D\u201d prescription drug program to $2,000. And Medicare-negotiated prices would be available to other buyers, such as employer health plans.\n\nThe plan is Pelosi\u2019s marker in what\u2019s shaping up as a high-stakes negotiation to determine if a drug pricing compromise can pass Congress this year or if Democrats and Republicans will take their differences into the 2020 elections.\n\nThe sweeping legislation leans left politically and appears to be tailor-made for Pelosi\u2019s Democratic majority in the House. But in a signal that Pelosi wants a deal, it also incorporates ideas from the Trump administration and from Republican and Democratic senators.\n\nA group of House Republicans led by Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., quickly accused Pelosi of putting \u201cpolitics over progress,\u201d calling her plan \u201ca socialist proposal to appease her most extreme members.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Americans across party lines say lowering prescription drug costs should be a top priority for Congress this year. Overall, 70 percent deemed that a top priority in a poll earlier this month from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nPresident Trump appears eager to sign prescription drug legislation and lower costs, but most Republicans oppose the Medicare negotiations that are the centerpiece of Pelosi\u2019s plan. The 2003 law that created Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefit barred the program from negotiating prices, a restriction Democrats have long opposed.\n\nAs a candidate, Trump backed Medicare negotiations. But after Trump was elected president, he seemed to revert to the traditional Republican position that price negotiations are best left to private players like insurance companies.\n\nWith tens of billions of dollars in profits at stake, drugmakers are determined to block any major changes to payment policies. But the industry\u2019s powerful lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, has been taking fire from all sides, from liberal Democrats to pro-business Republicans. Trump once accused drug companies of \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s proposal would:\n\n\u2022 Authorize Medicare to negotiate prices for the drugs with the greatest total cost to the program and the U.S. health care system. That includes pharmacy drugs covered through the popular \u201cPart D\u201d prescription benefit, along with \u201cPart B\u201d medications dispensed in doctors\u2019 offices, a category that covers many cancer drugs. The maximum price would be determined using a blend of international prices, an idea similar to a more limited proposal from the Trump administration. Insulin prices would be subject to negotiations. Drug companies that balk at making a deal would face penalties that start at 65% of sales for the drug at issue and would escalate if they hold out.\n\n\u2022 Require drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare if they hike their prices beyond the increase in inflation. That idea resembles a bipartisan plan from Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. The senators\u2019 proposal has already cleared a key committee, with Trump\u2019s support. But many Senate Republicans oppose inflation rebates, and it\u2019s unclear what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., plans to do next.\n\n\u2022 Limit what seniors pay out of pocket for their medications to $2,000 a year. Currently, Medicare\u2019s pharmacy benefit has no cap on copays, and the advent of drugs costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year has left some seniors saddled with bills that rival a mortgage payment. An out-of-pocket limit also is part of the Grassley-Wyden bill, and the idea also is backed by the Trump administration.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office says her plan is to have the legislation introduced and moved through House committees to a vote on the floor. If compromise can be reached among House Democrats, the Trump White House and enough GOP lawmakers, a drug pricing package could be added to year-end budget legislation.\n\nMovement in Congress comes at a time when criticism of the industry - from Trump and lawmakers of both parties - appears to be having an effect on prices.\n\nThe Commerce Department\u2019s inflation index for prescription drug prices has declined in seven of the last eight months, which is highly unusual. That index includes lower-cost generic drugs.\n\nThe story is different for brand name drugs, however. A recent analysis by The Associated Press shows that on average prices are still going up but at a slower pace. Costly brand-name drugs can translate to steep copays for insured patients.\n\nThe AP analysis found that in the first seven months of 2019, drugmakers raised list prices for brand name medicines by a median, or midpoint, of 5%.\n\nThat does reflect a slowdown. Prices were going up 9% or 10% over those months the prior four years.\n\nBut there were 37 price increases for every decrease in the first seven months of 2019.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Putting her stamp on the health care issue that worries consumers the most, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday unveiled an ambitious plan to lower drug prices for seniors on Medicare and younger people with private insurance.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/democrats_impeachment_90377_c0-0-4000-2332_s1770x1032.jpg?6fa6f1358e32f79a7430670803768e97648eaf7e", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
