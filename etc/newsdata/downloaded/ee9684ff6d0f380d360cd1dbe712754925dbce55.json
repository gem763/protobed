but there was disappointment that social care only got a brief nod, and no firm details were revealed.\n\nToday's programme of legislation was unusual because the Government has lost its majority in parliament and an election is anticipated shortly, but the pension proposals are uncontroversial and likely to have cross-party support.\n\nWe round up the key measures in the Pension Schemes Bill and what experts had to say about the Queen's Speech - including what was left out.\n\nUnusual Queen's Speech: The Government has lost its majority in parliament and an election is anticipated shortly - so will measures announced today come to pass?\n\nCombating scams: Pension providers could refuse transfers to suspect schemes\n\nThe Government will lay out new regulations for pension transfers, in a bid to prevent savers being lured into putting their money in bogus schemes.\n\nWatchdogs have raised concerns about the number of savers ditching final salary pensions - which provide guaranteed payouts from retirement until you die - many moving money into legitimate investments, but some at risk of fraud.\n\nThe Government said: 'The Pensions Regulator estimated there were 100,000 transfers out of defined contribution [final salary] schemes in 2017-18.\n\n'This indicates the volumes of transfers that could potentially be at risk of being scammed, and why the transfer measure in the Bill is so important.'\n\n'The Government's response to the rise of pension scams has been welcome but far too slow, leaving millions of people at greater risk of falling victim to fraudsters,' said Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n'This latest intervention, if it becomes law, was first proposed in 2017 and should strengthen the ability of pension providers to refuse a transfer where there is evidence the scheme someone is moving to is being used to facilitate scam activity.\n\n'Previously there has been a real tension between the right of savers to move their money to a different scheme, which is clearly very important, and the responsibilities on providers in blocking transfers to suspect schemes.'\n\nFinal salary schemes: New criminal sanctions against 'reckless behaviour' by bosses\n\nThe Pensions Regulator will get enhanced powers to respond earlier when employers do not take their responsibilities seriously, including 'taking tougher action against those who recklessly risk peoples' pension benefits'.\n\nA string of company failures have led to staff pensions being rescued by a lifeboat fund, where retirees have payments fully protected but workers only get 90 per cent of what they were due, and high earners may get less.\n\nCharles Counsell, chief executive of The Pensions Regulator, said: 'The Bill would give us the power to set and enforce clearer scheme funding standards in defined benefit pension schemes while also providing early warning of potential problems.\n\n'Where problems do arise, new criminal sanctions and civil fines will act as a strong deterrent against risky and reckless behaviour, giving us flexibility to issue fines at the appropriate level, depending on severity.'\n\nPensions dashboards: Protecting data from scammers will be crucial\n\nThe Government will pave the way for an online tool letting people view most of their pots in one place.\n\n'It's a bit like open banking but for pensions,' says Tom McPhail, head of pensions policy at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\n'The key to making it work is to force all pension providers to open up their data, which this legislation will now do.\n\n'Delivery of the dashboards may still be a few years away but in the end it will help with planning and cut down on lost pension pots.'\n\nTom Selby adds: 'Schemes won't be forced to provide data in the initial phase and total compulsion is expected to take years, meaning people will only see partial information.\n\n'Ensuring the limitations of early dashboards are made crystal clear to users will be vital in establishing and maintaining trust.\n\n'Protecting member's data to prevent scammers from infiltrating the system is of paramount importance and there should be no attempt to launch until security can be guaranteed.'\n\nCollective pension schemes: Half way house of shared investment risk\n\nThe Government will give the go-ahead to 'collective' pensions, where workers share investment risks in the hope of gaining more certainty over payouts in retirement.\n\nPensions won't be guaranteed - retirees could see their income rise or fall from year to year - which makes them insecure compared with traditional final salary pensions\n\nBut schemes will be designed to give stronger protections than modern defined contribution pensions, where individual workers bear all investment risks.\n\nMcPhail says: 'The Bill contains collective defined contribution provisions which will enable the Royal Mail to press ahead with their plans to develop this new half-way house type of scheme.\n\n'Whether any other employers follow the Royal Mail lead in the future is uncertain; there's currently no sign of a queue forming.'\n\nSocial care: Still no details of firm plan\n\nThe Government has long delayed publication of a consultation into overhauling the care system, and no details emerged today.\n\n'We will bring forward substantive proposals to fix the crisis in social care to give everyone the dignity and security they deserve,' it said.\n\nRachael Griffin, financial planning expert at Quilter, said: 'The UK's social care system has been primed for reform for what seems like an eternity.\n\n'Pledges to resolve the issue have been two a penny, but an elusive green paper has yet to materialise.\n\n'It appears that we have waited for so long that we are now going to bypass that stage altogether, with parties promising to deliver concrete proposals.\n\n'One policy growing in popularity for both camps is free personal care. The impetus for this kind of policy makes sense and it seems straight forward.\n\n'However, the government will need to be crystal clear to what is included within 'free' social care, as it is unlikely to include \"hotel costs\" such as room and board.'\n\nWhat was left out? Low earners deprived of pension cash, NHS staffing crisis and inheritance tax\n\n'There are other pressing pension priorities which need urgent Government attention and we hope some may feature in the planned Budget on 6 November,' said Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon.\n\n'These include ensuring non-taxpayers in 'net pay' schemes receive the 20 per cent tax relief on their pension contributions to which they are entitled. The lowest earners deserve every help they can get to save for their retirement.'\n\n'At the other end of the earnings spectrum, it's important to ensure tax rules and retirement savings incentives are fit for the future and work together without unintended adverse consequences.\n\n'Issues with highly paid health professionals in the NHS scheme have shone a light on the sheer complexity of rules around pension lifetime and annual allowances.\n\n'These are penalising an increasing number of people saving for retirement, encouraging some to refuse extra work or to retire early.'\n\nRachael Griffin adds.:'One notable absence from the speech was inheritance tax, which has been in the news yet again in recent weeks as politicians looking to woo voters have said they would consider scrapping it altogether.\n\n'This seems like too drastic a change, but reform would go a long way in winning the public's favour.\n\n'Estate taxes have become really complicated and more and more households are being dragged into paying IHT duties.'", "description": "Today's programme of legislation was unusual because the Government has lost its majority and an election is anticipated shortly, but the pension plans are likely to get cross-party support.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
