And could cost each person in this country over \u00a32,000 per year\u2019.\n\nCorbyn said Johnson has negotiated a deal that is \u2018even worse than the original withdrawal agreement\u2019.\n\nJeremy Corbyn says Boris Johnson\u2019s deal would \u2018sell workers down the river\u2019 (Picture: Reuters)\n\nHe accused the PM of being dishonest about the effect his deal would have on manufacturing and jobs.\n\nHe argued a vote for the deal would be a vote to cut jobs all over the country and usher in a \u2018Trump trade deal \u2026 exposing our families to chlorinated chicken\u2019.\n\nMoving onto workers rights, he quoted Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, who said the deal would hammer the economy, cost jobs and, \u2018sell workers down the river\u2019.\n\nHe was jeered as he mentioned her name but responded by saying she represented 6 million voters.\n\nAhead of his speech he said Labour would reject the deal, tweeting: \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s sell-out deal risks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US corporations.\u2019\n\nBoris Johnson's sell-out deal risks triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US corporations. Today, @UKLabour will reject it. \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) October 19, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been some suggestion that Labour could actually push Boris Johnson\u2019s deal over the line.\n\nThe PM is believed to have targeted MPsin vote-leaving areas for support.\n\nThe Labour leader has not confirmed if MPsin his party will have the whip removed if they vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nResponding to Corbyn\u2019s attack, Johnson said he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 with the tone used by his rival and claimed Corbyn didn\u2019t trust his own party.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
