Calling them \"liars\" or \"enemies\" could lead to threats and violence, particularly against Indigenous women, he said.\n\nNeve responded to an example given by Kenney in his speech in Fort McMurray on Tuesday where the premier joked about the imprisonment of Greenpeace activists in Russia.\n\n\"Their crew was arrested and thrown in a Siberian jail for six months and funnily enough, they've never been back,\" Kenney said to scattered nervous laughter from the crowd. \"I'm not recommending that for Canada but it's instructive.\"\n\nNeve said that kind of rhetoric creates the idea that it's fine for governments to jail human rights and environmental activists.\n\n\"I think that's precisely an example of the kind of thing we're very concerned about,\" Neve said.\n\nAs for Kenney's contention Amnesty International should focus its attention on Saudi Arabia and Russia, Neve said they are \"absolutely\" on top of the situation.\n\nNeve's letter comes one day after the Alberta government launched an online submissions page to support the public inquiry led by Commissioner Steve Allan.\n\nThe announcement provoked immediate backlash online.\n\nWhile the government said the site allows Albertans to send Allan relevant information for his investigation, critics said it amounted to a \"snitch line\" for people to report their neighbours for allegedly \"un-Albertan\" activities.\n\nThe #ReportAnAlbertan hashtag trended on Twitter Monday evening.\n\nThe first part of Allan's investigation is described as a fact-finding mission with trips to British Columbia and Washington, D.C. He will interview people and conduct research. He can hold public hearings if he chooses.\n\nAllan has the power to compel witnesses to testify and provide documents, but only within the province of Alberta.\n\nHis final report is due on July 2, 2020.", "description": "Amnesty International Canada says the Alberta government\u2019s plan to fight people who criticize the oil and gas industry exposes them to threats, intimidation and violates their human rights.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5181252.1560955337!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jason-kenney-sonya-savage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
