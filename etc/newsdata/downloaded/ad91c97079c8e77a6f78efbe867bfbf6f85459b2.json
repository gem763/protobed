When I choose to indulge in a local hotel stay, I prefer properties that feel like a respite from the city's frenetic pace.\n\nYet despite a busy Midtown address, The Chatwal was that hidden gem for me. Longing for a New York staycation, The Chatwal was the perfect place to spend an anniversary. It felt fully removed from the hustle of Manhattan, despite being located just blocks from Bryant Park and the Theater District.\n\nCombining Art Deco design, modern amenities, and luxurious accommodations, The Chatwal has cemented itself as my top choice in Midtown Manhattan. It's swanky, but with a warm, inviting atmosphere, and a great spot for a staycation or business travel, and for families who need joint-suites, and travelers who prefer a high-end, personalized stay.\n\nAs a luxury offering, typical room rates start at $500 in the low season rising above $600 in busy holiday periods. It's a splurge, especially compared to other hotels in the area, but worth it for those seeking a high level of service. Indeed, all guests receive butler services, which includes complimentary steaming, pressing, and shoe shine.\n\nAdditionally, The Chatwal is part of the Marriott Bonvoy group, so you can redeem and earn points during your stay. Marriott Bonvoy members may also receive exclusive rates, mobile check-in, and other perks depending on availability.\n\nI stayed in a Deluxe King Room, comped for review purposes, which falls in the middle of 13 total room categories, ranging from the Superior Queen, all the way up to the two-floor Penthouse Suite.\n\nKeep reading to see why I was so impressed by The Chatwal.", "description": "For a classic Manhattan stay steeped in luxury (with Marriott Bonvoy earning potential!), consider The Chatwal, located two blocks from Bryant Park and Times Square.", "authors": ["Lindsay Paige Stein"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db31103dee0192cff764405?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
