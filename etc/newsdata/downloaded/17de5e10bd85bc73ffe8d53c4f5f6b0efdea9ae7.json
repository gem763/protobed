How much longer, she asks, can a president survive a \u201c53.4 percent disapproval rating\u201d? As she notes, \u201cIn January 1974, well into the Watergate scandal, Richard Nixon\u2019s poll numbers on impeachment were better than Trump\u2019s.\u201d\n\nMcArdle\u2019s column foretells an imminent fall for the Bad Orange Man, suggesting Trump\u2019s ouster may be months or weeks away. If only there were a way to look into the future to see how her predictions might play out.\n\nAs it happens, there is. McCardle made those predictions on August 31 . . . in 2018. Spoiler alert! Thirteen months later, President Trump remains in office, not impeached.\n\nBut memories are short. McArdle returned the topic of impeachment in another column published late last month. She now sees the get-Trump forces succumbing to hypocrisy: \u201cThe irony of investigating a political rival for a grubbier and more explicit version of what you yourself are doing will be much-remarked in coming weeks . . . It\u2019s fair to chuckle at Democratic expense, but after all, life is full of such ironies.\u201d\n\nOh, how jaded the true believer has become!\n\n\u201cSo far,\u201d McArdle continues, \u201cconservatives have been saved from this fate by the #Resistance rushes to judgment . . . . With Trump, by contrast, the left followed a variation on the strategy of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Queen of Hearts \u2018Sentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf the Ukraine farce were a legitimate scandal, the Democrats would be using a fair and transparent process so that they could build confidence in their bipartisan audience.\n\nFumbles Aplenty\n\nMcArdle is also likely frustrated. With anti-Trump partisans\u2019 near-monopoly on expressed viewpoints in academia, television, print media, and entertainment, it must be really frustrating to see Trump\u2019s disapproval today holding steady around 53 percent. Because here\u2019s a really fun fact: On October 9, 2011, almost at exactly the same point in Barack Obama\u2019s administration, American disapproval of the 44th president was . . . 53 percent.\n\nThe Ukraine farce, led by Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) (why, exactly?), annoyed Trump initially. But the president has since turned the story to his advantage because of the conspirators\u2019 many fumbles.\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies now feature lacerating sarcasm at Schiff\u2019s expense. In contrast, the plotters have had to stretch and distort their original story to bridge the gap that emerged after the release of the Trump/Ukraine call transcript.\n\n\u201cNever drop the con. Die with the lie.\u201d Nicky Spurgeon once said. So, even though we can easily see the magically disappearing rabbit slithering out of his pant-leg, Schiff continues to pretend we need even more whistleblowers to tell us what\u2019s in a publicly available transcript. We can read exactly what was said during the call.\n\nWhy does Schiff insist on dropping more hints about a secret that has already been revealed? The answer, of course, is that the Schiff script calls for a calculated series of drip-drip-drips to keep his face on television in the hope that perhaps you will believe the spin instead of your lying eyes.\n\nLike the amateur screenwriter he is, Schiff evidently coached the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d before sending him to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general. Reciting his lines with near perfection, the whistleblower nevertheless forgot to disclose that he and Schiff had already met to strategize how best to leverage the complaint into an advantage in the 2020 presidential election. Well, maybe the whistleblower didn\u2019t forget because Schiff then lied about having any contact with the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nFor that claim, the Washington Post awarded Schiff four Pinocchios. People who have good facts are careful with them. That\u2019s the lesson taught by the fable of \u201cthe boy who cried wolf.\u201d Schiff is not careful with his facts and should never again be in charge of hunting wolves. Oh, and now it turns out that the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d worked for former Vice President Joe Biden and traveled to Ukraine with him.\n\nThe transcript of the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky does not provide evidence of a crime or abuse of power. Without a \u201ccrime\u201d to report, this is just a CIA employee\u2019s leak of a confidential diplomatic communication to meddle in next year\u2019s election\u2014which is a clear abuse of power. I\u2019m trying to remember the last story I read about the CIA that didn\u2019t involve leaking to meddle in U.S. domestic politics. A spy agency using its secrets to interfere with domestic elections: That\u2019s the road to tyranny.\n\nSchiff has compounded his lying and underhanded plotting by running a kangaroo proceeding that compares unfavorably to the due process of the Salem Witch Trials. Secret proceedings, secret even from the accused president\u2019s attorneys, allow Schiff to spoon-feed selective leaks to the colluding media. House Resolution 803 authorizing the impeachment investigation of President Nixon passed 410-4. Schiff\u2019s \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d defies three House votes not to impeach President Trump.\n\nLame Narratives Live On\n\nThe Ukraine farce and the Russia-collusion hoax share one key characteristic: Both \u201cscandals\u201d lumbered on long after an early revelation destroyed the theories behind them.\n\nAsk yourself, in all the time we labored under carpet-bombing coverage of the Russia collusion hoax, did the media ever clearly explain what the president supposedly did to collude with the Russians? That explanation was supposed to be, \u201cHe directed his personal attorney Michael Cohen to pay the DNC server hackers.\u201d But Cohen inconveniently produced his passport showing an ironclad alibi proving the meeting never happened.\n\nSimilarly, the Ukraine farce whistleblower made several guesses about the phone call that turned out not to be true. Yet the Ukraine story continues incoherently.\n\nIs it a matter of public interest that Hunter Biden received suspicious payments from an energy company that may have benefitted from Joe Biden\u2019s demand to fire a prosecutor? I would want to know more facts if the same could be said of Donald Trump and his son. Let\u2019s be honest: Trump is being attacked for not observing the entitled privilege the Bidens\u2019 elite status confers. The same thing happened when Trump fired James Comey and dared to call for a criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton.\n\nUkraine is a poorly written sequel to the Russia-collusion flop. The same 53 percent of Americans who disapproved of Donald Trump in August 2018 probably still disapprove of him today. The deep state needs new writers because this story isn\u2019t selling.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1158985977.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
