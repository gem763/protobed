Washington has also sent a complaint to Ankara.\n\nF-15 fighters and AH-64 Apache gunships were used in the \u201cshow of force\u201d on Tuesday, an unnamed US official told reporters, after the militants \u201cviolated a standing agreement\u201d not to threaten US troops. A formal complaint was lodged with the Turkish military through diplomatic channels, the official added.\n\nThough US troops have been withdrawing from Syria for the past week, some Special Forces operators were apparently still in the area of Ain Issa, located on the strategic M-4 highway about halfway between the Syrian-Turkish border and the former Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) \u201ccapital\u201d of Raqqa.\n\nLast week, Turkey launched \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019 with the stated purpose of establishing a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria \u2013 mainly on territory held by Kurdish militias allied with the US, but which Ankara considers terrorist organizations.\n\nAlso on rt.com Westerners who propped up Islamist \u2018moderate rebels\u2019 suddenly realize they're terrorists as they launch \u2018genocide\u2019 of Kurds\n\nRather than Turkish regulars, however, the troops used in the operation appear to be jihadist militants, which similarly happened in 2016 during \u2018Operation Euphrates Shield\u2019 that targeted the Kurds around Afrin.\n\nWhile the Western press has previously referred to these militants as \u201cmoderate rebels,\u201d a senior US official was quoted on Tuesday calling them \u201cthugs and bandits and pirates that should be wiped off the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nA senior US official told reporters the following about the proxy force Turkey is relying on as part of its Syria invasion: \"They could have used Turkish regular troops,...Instead they decided to use these thugs & bandits & pirates that should be wiped off the face of the earth\" \u2014 Ryan Browne (@rabrowne75) October 15, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Kurds have struck an agreement with the Syrian government troops to move to the border and block the militants. Previously, the US blocked any attempts to return the territories liberated from IS by its Kurdish allies to the government in Damascus, as they contained most of Syria\u2019s oil and agricultural resources.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
