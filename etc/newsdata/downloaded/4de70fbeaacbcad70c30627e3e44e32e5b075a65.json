Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump told attendees of a private event at the United Nations on Thursday, according to audio of his remarks posted by the Los Angeles Times and confirmed to The Washington Post by a person in attendance. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to a whistleblower complaint released Thursday, after the 30-minute call between the two presidents in which Trump encouraged an investigation into Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and asked Zelensky to work with Attorney General William P. Barr and Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, White House lawyers took unusual steps to keep the call\u2019s contents hidden.\n\nThe complaint said the transcript was \u201cloaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive level.\u201d According to the whistleblower, \u201cone White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nThe accusation of a coverup was another damning revelation in a tumultuous week for the White House. But the effort at secrecy surrounding the call was not surprising from the Trump White House, where the president often makes impolitic or inappropriate comments \u2014 and is also concerned with them becoming public and presses aides to ensure they do not, according to current and former administration officials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s President Trump. It\u2019s like a stream of consciousness. That\u2019s just the way he talks. I felt like I was in the room with him,\u201d Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), a Trump ally, said of the rough transcript.\n\nThe July 25 call had roughly 12 to 13 people listening in. That included at least three people from the Situation Room, who took notes and coordinated the call; at least two or three members of the national security adviser\u2019s leadership team; a State Department official who served as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s surrogate; and a senior representative from the Russia and Ukraine directorate, according to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nUnlike some other calls with foreign leaders, the conversation with Zelensky was expected to be routine, the whistleblower said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnce the call concluded and copies were distributed to top officials in the White House, lawyers in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office then directed that the document be moved to a code-word-protected secure computer network that is normally reserved for transcripts that contain national security secrets after officials raised concerns about Trump\u2019s comments, according to the complaint.\n\nThe system where the transcript was reportedly stored is for transcripts in which leaders discuss highly classified information, such as covert operations. They can only be accessed with a code word, and a senior White House official must request the transfer of the document to this system, according to current and former administration officials.\n\nTo transfer a call from the normal storage system to the National Security Council\u2019s code-word-protected network, a senior White House official \u2014 someone as high as the chief of staff or the national security adviser \u2014 must make a formal written request to do so, according to two people who worked with memos of calls with foreign leaders.\n\nFour former U.S. officials \u2014 including aides in previous administrations and the Trump administration \u2014 said they were not aware of any calls that did not contain highly classified information being housed in this type of storage system. One former Trump administration official said such calls were sometimes kept on the \u201chigh side,\u201d only available to aides with high clearances and separate laptops, but not the secure system the whistleblower alleges was used. \u201cNever heard of anything like that,\u201d said this official, who was privy to some of Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump ordered the move. But he has repeatedly fixated on disclosures to the news media, and his aides have spent considerable time trying to limit who hears his interactions with not only foreign leaders, but also lawmakers, friends and anyone else Trump consults with.\n\nThen-national security adviser John Bolton, in the wake of embarrassing revelations about Trump congratulating Russian President Vladimir Putin on his electoral victory in March 2018 after receiving a memo from his staff that said \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE,\u201d had dramatically cut back on the number of people who were allowed to listen in on Trump\u2019s calls. The earlier leak of transcripts of calls Trump had with the leaders of Mexico and Australia had also embarrassed the White House.\n\nThe paranoia grew outside conversations with foreign leaders. Trump has held sensitive meetings with his lawyers in the residence and asks for many meetings to be kept off his schedule. When legislative leaders come to the White House for meetings with the president, they are usually only allowed to bring their chiefs of staff along \u2014 or sometimes no one, according to people familiar with the meetings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt fundraisers, even donors and members of Congress now are forced to leave their phones outside in custom-made pouches so they cannot record the president, according to people who have attended the events. The rule was put in place last year, former aides said, after Trump\u2019s remarks leaked. \u201cI\u2019d never had that happen before,\u201d Doug Deason, a Trump donor, said in a 2018 interview. \u201cThe phones were all put in a pile outside.\u201d\n\nLarge meetings in the Oval Office \u2014 a mainstay early in Trump\u2019s presidency, where aides would hold gladiator-like policy fights \u2014 have been limited, current and former administration officials said.\n\nTrump often asks aides who they think is leaking, in part to decide whom to trust and in part to scare them, current and former administration officials said. In late 2018, after news that a Trump aide referred to the late senator John McCain as \u201cdying anyway,\u201d Trump called aides into the Oval Office. He asked them to identify \u201cleakers\u201d in the White House. At one point, Kelly Sadler, the aide who made the comments, accused her boss, Mercedes Schlapp, of leaking. \u201cYou\u2019re a liar!\u201d Schlapp shouted in response.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSenior Trump adviser Jared Kushner has bragged to his father-in-law that he should trust him because \u201cwhat I work on doesn\u2019t leak,\u201d according to a person who has heard the comments. Other aides scoff at that notion.\n\nAides know the easiest way to be fired from the West Wing is to be accused of leaking by colleagues. On Air Force One back to Washington after a rally last month, the president told advisers and guests that Bolton had leaked information and so needed to go, according to people familiar with his comments. Ironically, Bolton\u2019s entrance to the administration came partially over the president\u2019s furor over leaks that he privately blamed on people around Bolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R. McMaster.\n\nWhen Mick Mulvaney lobbied earlier this year for the job as chief of staff, he said one of his primary qualifications was that he would not leak information to the news media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhite House officials insisted this week there was no \u201cleak hunt\u201d for the whistleblower and that they \u2014 and the president \u2014 did not know the person\u2019s identity.\n\nBut Trump indicated Thursday that he wants to know the whistleblower\u2019s sources inside the administration.\n\nTo deter leaking, Trump often attacks people who disclose information in harsh terms, as do his advisers. That dynamic was on display Thursday as Trump and his surrogates sought to disparage the whistleblower as a partisan and a liar.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower is a son of a bitch who lied about me,\u201d Giuliani said in an interview Thursday.", "description": "While President Trump approved the release of the rough transcript this week to combat the whistleblower\u2019s allegations, he has once again charged that people with access to his calls are conspiring against him.", "authors": ["Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Carol D.
