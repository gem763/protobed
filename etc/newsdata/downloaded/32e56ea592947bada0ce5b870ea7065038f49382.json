Elizabeth Warren, who has released a proposal, said during the debate on Tuesday it is one of the only ways to ensure the country can make investments in the next generation.\n\n\u201cBillionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth and it just keeps growing,\u201d she explained.\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 who has put forth a more aggressive wealth tax proposal \u2013 said on Tuesday that the U.S. cannot afford \u201cto continue this level of income and wealth inequality\u201d and \u201ccannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.\u201d\n\nAs the only billionaire on stage, Tom Steyer claimed he was one of the first 2020 candidates to propose a wealth tax and added that he would undo the Republican tax cuts for the rich.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he is \u201call for a wealth tax.\u201d\n\nFormer Texas lawmaker Beto O\u2019Rourke said a wealth tax \u201cis part of the solution\u201d to address income inequality.\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro also said a wealth tax is part of the answer, but also said he supported an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate, alongside investments in things like health care and affordable housing.\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said a wealth tax \u201ccould work\u201d and that she is \u201copen to it.\u201d She also said she would repeal significant portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that helped the rich \u2013 including the corporate tax rate cut.\n\nOn the flip side, entrepreneur Andrew Yang said that while a wealth tax \u201cmakes sense in principle,\u201d it has been tried in a number of countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \u2013 like Germany and Denmark \u2013 which have since repealed it because it was hard to implement and generated less revenue than anticipated. Yang added the U.S. should learn from their experiences, and advocated for a value-added tax (VAT).\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden did not say he supported a wealth tax, but instead said he would raise the capital gains tax and eliminate loopholes in the tax code.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris said she would close the wealth gap using her LIFT the Middle Class Act, which provides working families with a tax credit. New Jersey Sen.
