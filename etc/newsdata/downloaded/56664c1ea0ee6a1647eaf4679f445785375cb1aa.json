The dried and stretched penises are also known as pizzles. They're a popular and tasty chew toy for dogs.\n\nWinsor, owner of the Pet Zone in St. John's, notified the police immediately. He spoke to As It Happens host Carol Off about the brazen theft.\n\nHere's part of their conversation.\n\nMark, before we get to the theft, if we could just clear something up: why does your pet store sell penises?\n\nIt's a popular item. I guess it's because it's digestible.\n\nIt's just easier for a dog to chew on. You know, years ago it was the old, I don't if everyone remembers, but it was the old bleached white and brown rawhide, which made it much more difficult to digest.\n\nAnd the taste, and not to sound gross or nothing, but the taste is is much more flavourful for a dog.\n\nWhat do you think it tastes like?\n\nI never tried one, but they are popular and dogs do love them.\n\nSeveral Pizzles, or dehydrated bull penises, have been stolen from Pet Zone in St. John's, Nfld. (Submitted)\n\nWhen did you realize that you had been robbed?\n\nIt was just Saturday past around 5:00 p.m. we got a call. We're still mind-boggled until this day.\n\nIt was a man and a woman that done the theft. We do have surveillance so you can see them take the handfuls of, well, pizzles-slash-penis.\n\nAnd they tried to put it up their shirt or, you know, wherever they tried to put it. But they took so much of it in their hands. They just walked out like it was a normal shopping day.\n\nAnd how many did they walk out with?\n\nThey walked out with hundreds of dollars worth, believe it or not. Because how it goes with the pizzle is the longer, well, the more it costs. And, you know, the shorter, well, it doesn't cost as much.\n\nMaybe they were going to resell them somewhere. Unless the couple really, really loved their animals. - Mark Winsor\n\nSo people like the long ones.\n\nIt's all based on preference with the size [of the] dog. Then, you know, if you have a big dog, well then you go with a longer one.\n\nSo, again, what happens with the pizzle, is where is dehydrated, you know, the animal starts from the tip and then they just keep on chewing down till there's nothing left.\n\nWhat's the longest pizzle you've had?\n\nAbout four feet long.\n\nGood heavens.\n\nYeah. Right from four feet to four inches.\n\nAnd so a dog works that thing until it's gone, I guess.\n\nYeah. And again, it's much more safe. Again, you don't have to worry about any splintering. It doesn't cause any blockages.\n\nSo how do you think that thieves could unload stolen bull penises?\n\nMaybe they were going to resell them somewhere. The black market did cross my mind. Unless the couple really, really loved their animals.\n\nSo they may have been stealing them for their pets. OK. There's that possibility. But what's the value?\n\nYeah, well, if we sold, say a three foot one, there about $24 for a three-foot one.\n\nOK. So what do you think the street value of the bull penis is?\n\nThe street value? You probably get them for $15 each. Maybe more. You know, the pizzle is a very high-end item.\n\nBecause they're so popular, it's the market, I guess, that drives them up because they're in high demand.\n\nWhen the thieves left with their pizzles, from our location here in St. John's, they actually went afterwards to our sister store, believe it or not.\n\nFor more pizzles?\n\nWe don't know. We went through the surveillance and what had happened was at our sister store, right away, we got a call.\n\nOur supervisor here was just on the radar to make sure everything is all right in the store. She noticed that the thieves were in our other store.\n\nDo think you you might, in the future, have to get some kind of a case, like lock up your pizzles, so they don't get stolen?\n\nWell, you know, it's funny. Not to sound crude on the phone, but you know, people like to see things and people like to touch.\n\nGot it.\n\nThat's the way it is, you know?\n\nIt's like when people go to a grocery store. People like to to look at their fruits and when people come into our store they look they like to look at all these different type of parts that we sell. To lock them up, you know, that's something that I wouldn't agree with.\n\nWritten by Jeanne Armstrong and John McGill. Interview produced by Jeanne Armstrong.
