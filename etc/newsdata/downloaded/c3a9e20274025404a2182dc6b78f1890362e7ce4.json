(Branden Camp/AP)\n\nFormer president Jimmy Carter expressed doubt Tuesday night that he would have been able to handle the presidency at age 80, saying the job requires being \u201cvery flexible with your mind\u201d and suggesting that there should be an age limit.\n\nCarter did not mention any of the current presidential candidates in his comments, but two leading Democratic contenders \u2014 former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 would turn 80 while in office if elected.\n\nQuestion\u2019s about Biden\u2019s age and mental acuity, in particular, have become part of the conversation in the Democratic nominating process. He is currently 76, while Sanders is 78.\n\nCarter, who turns 95 next month, was asked during an event at the Carter Center in Atlanta what it would take for him to run for president again. The questioner noted that Grover Cleveland had served two nonconsecutive terms in the late 19th century.\n\n\u201cI hope there\u2019s an age limit,\u201d Carter said with a big grin as he sat next to his wife, Rosalynn Carter.\n\n[Jimmy Carter says Trump wouldn\u2019t be president without help from Russia]\n\n\u201cYou know, if I were just 80 years old, if I was 15 years younger, I don\u2019t believe I could undertake the duties that I experienced when I was president,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one thing, you have to be very flexible with your mind. You have to be able to go from one subject to another and concentrate on each one adequately and then put them all together in a comprehensive way.\u201d\n\nCarter added that presidents \u201calso have to adopt new ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe things I faced just in foreign affairs, I don\u2019t think I could undertake them if I was 80 years old,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo 95 is out of the question. I\u2019m having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, must less run for president.\u201d\n\nCarter, who said he voted for Sanders in Georgia\u2019s 2016 Democratic primary, replied to a separate question by saying he is keeping \u201can open mind\u201d about the current crop of Democrats.\n\n\u201cOne of the major factors I will have in my mind is who can beat Trump,\u201d he said, referring to the current president, who is 73.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump\u2019s campaign released a video that strung together several of Biden\u2019s recent verbal gaffes and included clips of political commentators questioning whether he remained as mentally sharp as he once was.\n\nDuring Tuesday night\u2019s event, Rosalynn Carter also took aim at Trump.\n\n\u201cI think we need a new president,\u201d the former first lady said. \u201cI am so disturbed about white power. He says he is not a racist and maybe he is not. But some of the things he says encourages racism.\u201d", "description": "The former president didn\u2019t mention any current White House contenders, but both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would reach that threshold while in office.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h37alJQOdfVbNOw772TtGfaIBuU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PQZTSXG2AQI6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
