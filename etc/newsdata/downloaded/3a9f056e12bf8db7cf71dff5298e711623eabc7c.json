A quarter of a century later, the Newcastle manager sees similarities, whether in the defensive tactics he and other coaches adopt against favourites, or in the characteristics of Liverpool\u2019s feared front three.\n\nFor Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, the wingers who double up as sprinters, read Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis. For Roberto Firmino, the selfless, catalytic fulcrum who set up two goals in Newcastle\u2019s 3-1 defeat on Saturday, see Eric Cantona.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Saturday\u2019s flick to release Salah when the Egyptian scored was the kind of productive trickery in which Cantona specialised.\n\n\u201cCantona is as good a player as I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said the former United captain. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Firmino week in week out like that, but just when you see him here and what he gives them, it\u2019s a perfect balance. Cantona gave us that. Back in the day, we had Giggs and Kanchelskis who had frightening pace and stretched sides so much like Liverpool\u2019s two, and Cantona dropped into that hole and people couldn\u2019t get anywhere near them. That\u2019s what you see with Firmino.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Player ratings: Liverpool vs Newcastle Show all 24 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch.

And his attitude and work rate, it\u2019s so important. Their front three are as good as you are going to play against as a threat to you.\u201d\n\nIf there is a fundamental tactical difference, in that the spearhead of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s first Double-winning was Mark Hughes while Klopp\u2019s Liverpool have dispensed with the target man, used the wingers further infield and made them more prolific than their United counterparts, it points to an evolution in tactics.\n\nGiggs and Kanchelskis scored a combined 27 goals in 1993-94; it was Salah\u2019s total alone last season and if Mane had one fewer then, he is outscoring the Egyptian thus far this year. Yet the common denominator is that underdogs reconfigure their teams out of worry. The fear factor alters approaches.\n\nBruce played in a day when 4-4-2 systems were default until opponents started sacrificing a striker against United. Now Liverpool often find themselves facing 5-4-1 formations, shapes which, in other matches, could be called 3-4-2-1 but at Anfield tend to look ultra-defensive.\n\n\u201cBack when I played for United, everybody suddenly started playing one centre forward against us,\u201d Bruce recalled. \u201cBack in the day, everyone played with two, then suddenly they would put an extra midfield player in, and it\u2019s what you have to do because you are under threat of getting a hiding.\u201d\n\nLike a more recent United employee, Jose Mourinho, last December Bruce used a 3-4-2-1 that, in effect, was 5-4-1 at Anfield. Like him, he lost 3-1. The context is different, however: an Old Trafford old boy has spent the majority of his managerial career with bottom-half Premier League sides. He knows the challenges they face against the very best.\n\n\u201cThe big difficulty we all have is you have to find a way when you know a team is far better than you \u2013 and I say that with no disrespect at all to us,\u201d he rationalised. \u201cA team like Liverpool, they have two full-backs up the pitch, they will attack at every opportunity, then you face being blown away. They can do that to you, and you have to acknowledge that. If you open up against them, and leave big spaces for them to run in behind, then you are totally going to be punished. There\u2019s the that conundrum. When you try to negate them, then you see why they haven\u2019t lost for two years here.\u201d\n\nMatches become damage-limitation exercises. In the context, a 3-1 reverse felt more than respectable. Liverpool\u2019s club record 14 consecutive league wins have all been secured by at least two goals. \u201cThey are a very, very good team,\u201d Bruce reflected. The Manchester side he now compares Liverpool to are not United, but City. \u201cAt this moment in time is there anyone better? The one down the road, I suppose, at the minute, but they are certainly as good as you get.\u201d", "description": "If Liverpool teams are destined to be burdened with comparisons to their illustrious predecessors, it is a sign of the excellence of Jurgen Klopp\u2019s European champions that they instead reminded their latest victim of historic enemies.", "authors": ["Richard Jolly"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/14/mohamed-salah.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
