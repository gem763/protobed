The event was promoted on Facebook (FB) and all the photos have been posted there. The organizing committee used Facebook, last known addresses, old fashioned snail mail and networking to get the word out about the evening.\n\nFacebook has allowed classmates from Alaska and California to be connected and involved. A number of my classmates are not involved in social media of any sort and still have flip phones. Some classmates I found out that evening follow me on Twitter (TWTR) and one was a day trader in his retirement. I plan on keeping things simple today and just take a look at a few charts of FB as it looks like a new move to the upside may be starting.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of FB, below, we can see that prices successfully tested the rising 200-day moving average line earlier this month. FB is now above the bottoming 50-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been rising this month and suggests we have ended a period of aggressive selling and started a period of aggressive buying. The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has crossed to the upside this month generating a cover shorts buy signal and the zero line is nearby. A move above the zero line tells us that the trend has strengthened and an outright buy signal has been made.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of FB, below, we can see that prices tested the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is stronger than the daily line and shows an uptrend going back three years. This is a clear sign of aggressive buying and is most impressive that the line continued to rise even during the 2018 sell off.\n\nThe MACD oscillator is above the zero line but in a take profits sell mode; however, the indicator is narrowing and we could see a new buy signal in the weeks ahead.\n\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of FB, below, the software is projecting a potential upside price target of $329.\n\nBottom-line strategy: Aggressive traders could go long FB here at current levels and add on strength. I tend to doubt we will see a pullback or dip to buy. Risk a decline below $177 for now.", "description": "Can Facebook 'Connect' for Investors as Well as It Does for Classmates?...FB", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Can Facebook 'Connect' For Investors As Well As It Does For Classmates", "Facebook'S Stock Is Starting A New Move Higher.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Ed Ponsi", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/fc646baf-ae35-11e9-ad16-fb4cf21d7c86.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
