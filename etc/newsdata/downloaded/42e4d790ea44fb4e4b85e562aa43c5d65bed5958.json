Brennan was there to meet with Alejandro Castro-Espin (Raul Castro\u2019s son, the KGB-trained head of Cuba\u2019s counterintelligence service, who authored a book titled \u201cU.S.-Empire of Terror\u201d) and discuss increasing intelligence cooperation between the two countries. Brennan considered Cuba\u2019s spy agencies the most capable in Latin America, and hoped to work with them against drug cartels and terrorist networks.\u201d\n\nBrennan definitely had a point. Thanks to the CIA\u2019s historic penchant for hiring and promoting people like John Brennan, Castro\u2019s DGI and DI has historically run rings around the CIA, while guffawing.\n\nBut it gets even \"better\":\n\n\u201cBrennan\u2019s talks with Alejandro Castro took place at a discreet government guesthouse, where a day of formal negotiations was followed by a banquet featuring a spit-roasted pig. U.S. officials said that, during the talks, Cuban leaders made it clear that they respected the C.I.A.\u201d\n\nI bet! But \u201crespect\u201d probably isn\u2019t the proper word\u2014unless The Pink Panther \u201crespects\u201d inspector Clouseau and The Roadrunner \u201crespects\u201d Wile E. Coyote.\u201d The word \u201cappreciate\u201d fits much better. Perhaps these (thoroughly-documented) historic items will help us understand this unbounded appreciation:\n\nIn 1987, Cuban intelligence officer Florentino Aspillaga defected in Prague and revealed that every single Cuban agent (four dozen of them) the CIA had recruited to spy on the Castro regime since 1962 was a double agent controlled personally by Fidel Castro. Now backtracking a few years:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve infiltrated Castro\u2019s guerrilla group in the Sierra Mountains. The Castro brothers and Ernesto \u2018Che\u2019 Guevara have no affiliations with any Communists whatsoever.\u201d (Havana CIA station Chief Jim Noel, sneering in typical CIA, Ivy league blueblood manner at tacky warnings from Cuban \u201cMcCarthyite deplorables\u201d in Nov. 1958.)\n\n(In fact all three of these hardcore Stalinists poised to take over Cuba had a KGB-handler named Nikolai Leonov since 1954!)\n\n\u201cFidel Castro is not only NOT a communist \u2013he\u2019s a strong ANTI-Communist fighter! He\u2019s ready to help us in the hemisphere\u2019s anti-communist fight and we should share our intelligence with him. (CIA Cuba \"expert\u201d Frank Bender, April, 1959.)\n\nNow let\u2019s fast forward to April 2015, just a few weeks prior to Brennan\u2019s ultra-secret trip to Havana:\n\n\u201cCuba is not a threat to the United States\u2026They don\u2019t implicate our national security in any way\u2026The government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period; and the government of Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future.\u201d (President Obama after meeting with Raul Castro in Panama and recommending that Stalinist Cuba be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, April 14th, 2015.).\n\nPresumably the head of the CIA at the time, John Brennan, who had been a close national security advisor to Barack Obama since his 2008 campaign, signed-off on (and maybe even encouraged) Obama\u2019s decision to whitewash and legitimize the Castro-Family-Crime-Syndicate. Never mind that this whitewash required taking one of modern history\u2019s most infamous liars at his word.\n\nBut in fact, only a few weeks before Obama\u2019s (and presumably Brennan\u2019s) giddy acceptance of Castro\u2019s promise (\u201ccross my heart and hope to die!\u201d), Castro got caught red-handed supplying Chinese-made arms to the Western hemisphere\u2019s oldest, biggest and most murderous terror-group: Colombia\u2019s FARC. The terror-death toll from these Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) exceeds 200,000, and includes more U.S. citizens than were murdered by ISIS.\n\nSo maybe it was a mere coincidence that the very week Obama (with presumably Brennan\u2019s support) planned to remove Cuba as a terror-sponsor, the mainstream media (especially CNN) blacked-out any mention of this blatant terror-sponsorship by Cuba in our own backyard.\n\nYou see, amigos: In February 2015, Colombian authorities found 99 missile heads, 100 tons of gunpowder, 2.6 million detonators, and over 3,000 artillery shells hidden under rice sacks in a ship bound from Red China to Cuba that docked in the port of Cartagena, Colombia.\n\nMost Cuba-watchers immediately guessed what was up. And crackerjack Colombian (NOT CNN or New York Times, heaven forbid!) reporters quickly investigated and exposed the Castro-regime\u2019s terror-sponsoring scheme. In brief:\n\n*The arms were from a Chinese manufacturer named Norinco and the recipient was a Cuban company named Tecnoimport.\n\n*But the ship stopped in the Colombian ports of Cartagena and Barranquilla (where the FARC is based.)\n\n*Colombia\u2019s crackerjack newspaper El Espectador also reported that many Norinco-manufactured arms had already been captured from FARC guerrillas over the past 10 years. This proliferation of Cuba-smuggled Chinese arms to the terrorist FARC got so bad that in 2007-08 the Colombian authorities sent a diplomatic protest note to the Chinese.\n\nThis awkward information at such an awkward time, needless to say, might have hampered Obama\u2019s plan (with presumably Brennan\u2019s support) to cleanse the Castro regime from any taint of terror-sponsorship\u2014at least for people with half-a-brain.\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t the head of (probably) the world\u2019s largest and most lavishly\u2013funded intelligence agency (the CIA) have been aware of this Cuban terror-sponsorship on our very doorstep? So how could he possibly sign-off on Obama\u2019s howler that \u201cthe government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding six-month period?\u201d\n\nTwo years earlier (with John Brennan the recently appointed CIA director by Obama) Panamanian authorities discovered unregistered Russian missile parts and actual MiG jets hidden in a North Korean ship that had just left terror-sponsoring Cuba and was bound for terror-sponsoring North Korea through the Panama Canal. All the Russian-made contraband was hidden under sacks of Cuban sugar. An investigation by a U.N. panel (no less!) concluded that the Cuban smuggling was a blatant violation of international sanctions.)\n\nShouldn\u2019t a CIA director have been aware of this illegal, blatant and repeated smuggling of arms from one terror-sponsor to another in our own backyard?\n\nOf course. But looking the other way was very convenient for de-classifying the blatantly guilty party from the list of terror-sponsors--a condition Castro demanded before he would deign to allow Obama to legitimize and enrich his regime. The Castros, you see, knew full well how Obama desperately craved the \u201copening to Cuba\u201d for his \u201clegacy.\u201d\n\nSo they had a ball! They played him like a fiddle, humiliating his \u201cnegotiators\u2019 (mostly Pajama-Boy Ben Rhodes) at every turn and absolutely mercilessly, while snickering.\n\nApparently Brennan\u2019s Cuba trip had results. To wit:\n\n\u201cCuba and the United States signed an agreement to cooperate in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking\u2026A delegation of Cuban government national security officials recently toured the Pentagon\u2019s counter-drug center in Key West (in May, 2016)\u2014 a first, signaling a nascent effort in U.S.-Cuban security cooperation. They got a briefing on the work that has been described as Southcom\u2019s command center in the war on drugs.\u201d\n\nResult of this Brennan-encouraged \u201ccooperation?\u201d\n\n\u201cPanamanian authorities on Saturday (May, 18, 2019) intercepted 46 suitcases containing an estimated $90 million in illegal drugs on a cargo ship that arrived from a Cuban port and was en route to Istanbul, Turkey. The suitcases contained 1,517 packages of drugs hidden in a container declared as containing charcoal.\u201d\n\nNeedless to add: no mainstream U.S. media portal (not even Fox!) bothered reporting on this blockbuster embarrassment to the Obama/Brennan \u201cnational security\u201d team.", "description": "\u201c(In Aug. 2015) an unmarked U.S. government plane landed at .10/12/2019 2:43:55AM EST.", "authors": ["Humberto Fontova", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/231/db5238ab-07a8-4ca4-92fc-e6b43259a1af.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
