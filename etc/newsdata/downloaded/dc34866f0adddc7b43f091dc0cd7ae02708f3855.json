Eight XR protesters were arrested as a result of the action but British Transport Police have now confirmed that the commuters involved are also being investigated\n\nPictured: Angry commuters pull the doctor from the train in Canning Town, east London, in ugly scenes\n\nThe XR gang who caused chaos for London Underground commuters were later identified as a Buddhist teacher, a doctor, a grandfather and a vicar.\n\nMark Ovland gave up his full-time Buddhist teacher training studies earlier this year to join XR as a 'full time protestor'. Other XR campaigners joining him in the Tube action included pensioner Phil Kingston, 83, who earlier this month was pictured standing on top of a fire engine as activists sprayed 1,800 litres of fake blood over the Treasury.\n\nSelf-described Green Christian Ruth Jarman, a 56-year-old vicar, was also pictured protesting on the London Underground network.\n\nAuthorities are acquiring evidence against a number of commuters who were involved in Thursday's violent rush hour scenes.\n\nGreen Christian Ruth Jarman (left), 56, was also pictured protesting on the network, as she offered assistance to pensioner Phil Kingston (right)\n\nPictured: Jarman at the DLR station in Canning Town, east London, as Phil Kingston glues himself to the carriage\n\nBuddhist trainee teacher Mark Ovland (left in left picture, and right) was among those arrested at Caning Town Thursday for scrambling atop a tube\n\nThe latest development comes after Extinction Rebellion received criticism and even left members of its own camp divided for choosing to target the underground station during rush hour.\n\nSeveral videos surfaced of ugly scenes at Canning Town station, showing one protester walking on top of the train as a crush of commuters jeer at him to get down.\n\nOne throws a cup of coffee over the him and a group then give another commuter a boost so he can reach the protester's ankle and drag him off the carriage to the platform.\n\nChaos: XR activist Mark Ovland is dragged off the train by irate commuters at Canning Town station, East London\n\nOnce he hits the ground, the video shows, an angry group of commuters surround him and some were caught on camera seemingly kicking and attacking the man, before a London Underground employee steps in.\n\nBefore 7am protesters arrived en masse at the east London station and unfurled a banner reading 'business as usual = death'. At least two scaled a train as it waited to depart sparking violent fury from commuters.\n\nIn a statement Extinction Rebellion acknowledged one of their own protesters had turned violent on Thursday morning.\n\nXR said: 'We are aware that one of our activists responded in self defence in a moment of panic when confronted by a threatening situation. He acknowledges his accountability for this action and we offer gratitude for members of the public who helped to protect him.'\n\nThe group went on: 'The people involved today did not take this action lightly. They were a grandfather, an ex-buddhist teacher, a vicar and a former GP among others who acted out of rational fear for the future as this crisis deepens.'\n\nIt was revealed that nine out of ten members of Extinction Rebellion were against the London Tube protests that sparked violent scenes.\n\nIn a poll of more than 2,000 members on an XR discussion forum, 88 per cent said they did not want the Tube protests to go ahead.\n\nSome now fear the 'arrogant attitude' of a small minority acting under a 'banner of anarchy' will lead to further violence.\n\nEven supporters of the Tube protests feared that disrupting 'poorer' commuters and 'people of colour' would confirm the idea that the group is white and middle class\n\nFour protesters were arrested at Canning Town and Stratford and a further four were arrested at Shadwell where demonstrators had glued themselves to an electric DLR train.\n\nMahatir Pasha, who filmed the video at Canning Town, told GMB: 'When I was there it was absolutely shocking scenes. I didn't expect to see anything like it.\n\n'We heard a big thud on top of the train. The driver made a short announcement. One like I've never heard before: 'Hey what are you doing', and the line cut off.\n\n'I saw two men standing on the train. They pulled out a banner. They said something along the lines of 'We're all going to die'.\n\nShe said the police arrived quickly once things 'got violent' and said a TFL member of staff 'did his absolute utmost' to protect commuters.\n\nCommuters took to Twitter to point out the consequences of the group's actions\n\nShe said that one of the commuters shouted: 'Look I'm just trying to get to work and feed my kids.'\n\nOn Twitter commuters pointed out the disruption had caused them to switch from the tube to a relatively more polluting car this morning.\n\nExtinction Rebellion co-founder Clare Farrell defended the Tube action and said: 'The public, I don't think, realise quite how serious this situation is.'\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she added: 'It is still peaceful, and it is still non-violent.\n\n'People did a similar action in April on the DLR train, those people were safe.\n\n'It makes them vulnerable, and that's what people are there to do when they put their body on the line.\n\n'There is a vast vulnerability that people have in the face of climate and ecological emergency.'\n\nSpokesperson Valerie Milner-Brown said: 'This is disruption with a purpose since we will all encounter far greater disruption in the future if we don't radically change our society.\n\n'We can already see the horrifying early effects of the climate and ecological emergency in parts of the Global South and it's clear that this will be coming our way soon.\n\n'Government needs to start taking seriously the deep concerns of tens of thousands of experts and scientists globally, so that we can create a society that is built to put resilience and community before profit.'\n\nXR spokesman Howard Rees, 39, said: 'Was it the right thing to do? I am not sure. I think we will have to have a period of reflection. It is too early to say. I think we need to take stock of it.'\n\nIt was revealed that nine out of ten members of Extinction Rebellion were against the London Tube protests that sparked violent scenes.", "description": "Police are investigating and seeking to acquire evidence on commuters who were filmed appearing to kick and beat XR protesters who targeted Canning Town tube station Thursday.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/00/19941210-0-image-a-17_1571528661747.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
