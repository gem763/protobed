Well, except for the blowing a 2-0 lead part, but that seems like ancient history.\n\nThe past is the past at this point, it\u2019s down to one game for the World Series title and the Washington Nationals have Max Scherzer starting, which is better than almost any other alternative.\n\nScherzer, you\u2019ll remember, was supposed to pitch Game 5 but was a late scratch because of a neck and back injury. It was a surprise, since Scherzer is about as intense a competitor as there is in MLB. Joe Ross took his place. The Astros won that game, but all things considered, it could have gone worse for the Nats.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter Stephen Strasburg\u2019s 8.1 innings performance in Game 6, the Nats now find themselves with a relatively rested group in the bullpen and their ace on the mound. They\u2019d have signed up for that.\n\nThe question around Scherzer is just how healthy he is, what his stuff will look like and what could knock him out of the game early. He got a cortisone shot to relieve his pain and played catch before Game 6. He felt well enough that he went down to the bullpen at one point during the Nats\u2019 thrilling win but never saw action.\n\nThe Astros will counter with Zack Greinke, their trade-deadline acquisition, who started Game 3. He wasn\u2019t amazing, but he did enough for the Astros to win. He has a 5.30 ERA in four starts this postseason, but when he\u2019s on, can be a much better pitcher than that.\n\nThis will be the first World Series Game 7 in history with two Cy Young winners. Buckle up.\n\nMax Scherzer is getting the ball for the Washington Nationals in Game 7 after missing Game 5 because of injury.

The home team has lost every game, which is a first in not only World Series history, but it\u2019s never happened in the NBA or NHL finals, either. If that keeps up, it certainly favors the Nationals.\n\nTwo other facts to consider: Home teams don\u2019t actually have an advantage historically in World Series Game 7s. They\u2019re 19-20. The last three World Series Game 7s \u2014 2017, 2016 and 2014 \u2014 were all won by the visiting team.\n\nGame 7 pageantry\n\n\u2022 The first pitch will be thrown by two Astros legends and MLB Hall of Famers \u2014 Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio.\n\n\u2022 Country singer Cody Johnson will sing the National Anthem.\n\n\u2022 Film star and meme-able leading man Matthew McConaughey will do the \"Play Ball\" call.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n\u201cYeah, it's going to be a big game,\u201d \u2014 Zack Greinke, man of few words, sizing up the importance of Game 7.\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nGame 7 starts at 8:07 p.m. ET from Minute Maid Park in Houston.
