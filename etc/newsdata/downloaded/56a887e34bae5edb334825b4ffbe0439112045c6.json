'Even if I hadn't been decisive for a while, I always had the manager's trust. It is always important to have the manager's faith.\n\n'Of course (I knew it would be hard moving to England). It is a league totally different to Ligue 1, with a different intensity.\n\n'For me, I had to adapt quickly because expectations were high. Unfortunately, it is not what I did at the beginning but I have always had the manager's trust and the players have supported me.\n\n'I keep working hard to perform well and adapt to the Premier League.'\n\nMatteo Guendouzi points at Pepe as the Arsenal players celebrate their equalising goal\n\nBefore his match-winning cameo on Thursday Pepe had scored just once in his first 11 appearances - converting a penalty in another 3-2 comeback win, this time over Aston Villa.\n\nNow he is hoping his brace of free-kicks against Vitoria can mark a watershed moment for both him and the club as a whole this season, starting with the weekend visit of Crystal Palace.\n\n'Scoring two goals is good for the confidence,' he said.\n\n'The most important though is that there is a win at the end. It shows our mental strength and our character.\n\nPepe faces up against Davidson during the match which he hopes will spark an upturn in form\n\n'We had already done it against Aston Villa where we were behind and came back. Now, we can focus on the Crystal Palace game which will arrive very quickly.\n\n'I am not at my best physically because I didn't have a proper pre-season like the others.\n\n'I was at the African Nations Cup. I started little by little and the manager knew about it. I am trying to work hard to be stronger physically to perform well.'\n\nThe prospect of seeing Pepe link up with fellow attacking talents Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette would have had Arsenal supporters excited before the season began.\n\nPepe says he has always had the full support of his manager Unai Emery at Arsenal\n\nBut, mainly due to a troublesome ankle issue for Lacazette which required surgery, the trio have started just once together since Pepe's arrival.\n\n'We have played very little together,' he added.\n\n'But we get on well, we all speak French. For us, it is easy to understand each other. I hope we will play more together.\n\n'As soon as I arrived they helped me. I talked a lot to them. Matteo (Guendouzi) too.\n\n'I also manage to talk to the other players because it is important to learn the language to communicate with everyone.'", "description": "Nicolas Pepe admits he has struggled to live up to the high expectations of becoming Arsenal's record signing but praised head coach Unai Emery for trusting in his ability.", "authors": ["Mark Mann-Bryans", "Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20176414-0-image-a-63_1572004627271.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
