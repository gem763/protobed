And yes, that includes physical game discs: at launch, you\u2019ll be able to buy hard copies of games like Bloodborne, God of War III Remastered, and Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End. The store is open exclusively in the US, and, according to Sony, it\u2019s intended to allow gamers to purchase products from the company itself. It\u2019s also meant to \u201chelp gift givers easily find the right product for their friends or family.\u201d Prices \u201calign with those found at other retailers,\u201d and PlayStation Plus members who are signed in are eligible for free one-day shipping.\n\nThe move comes ahead of the busy holiday season, and it\u2019s launching with its own limited time promotion: you\u2019ll be able to buy a PlayStation 4 with a yearlong subscription to PS Plus for $339.99 or a PlayStation 4 Pro and a yearlong subscription to PS Plus for $429.99.\n\nOpening the PlayStation storefront to direct purchases is a savvy decision. The world of online commerce is infinitely diverse and growing, so it makes sense that Sony would want a more direct hand in how its products are purchased. It also puts PlayStation on par with competitors Nintendo and Microsoft, which both have online stores where you can buy physical products and accessories. In any case, it\u2019s great for consumers, too: now, you can buy all of your PlayStation products in one place (that isn\u2019t Amazon).", "description": "Beginning on September 25th, you can buy hardware and accessories directly from the online PlayStation storefront.
