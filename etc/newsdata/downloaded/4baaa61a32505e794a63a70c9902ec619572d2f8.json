The promotion was revealed last night on discount site hotukdeals.com.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough to tempt hungry customers, the gigantic bucket will be priced at just \u00a35.99, which works out as less than 8p per piece. It\u2019s also cheaper than their popular Zinger box meal.\n\nPopcorn chicken boxes usually cost \u00a33.99, with less than half the amount of chicken, so there are some significant savings to be had.\n\nGet stuck in (Picture: HotUKdeals)\n\nHowever, there is one slight catch.\n\nKFC have revealed that the tasty offer will only be available in Glasgow until 17 November, due to the fact that it\u2019s part of a trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ten participating Glasgow branches include Kilkcaldy Central Retail Park, Hamilton Palace Grounds Retail Park, Dunfermline \u2013 Fife Leisure Park, Falkirk \u2013 Callandar Road, Cumbernauld \u2013 South Muirhead Road, Wishaw \u2013 Glasgow Road, Glasgow \u2013 Nitshill Rd, London Rd, Motherwell and Rutherglen.\n\nA tasty deal (Picture: HotUKdeals)\n\nOf course fast food fans were quick to comment on the new deal.\n\nOne posted on hotdeals.uk: \u2018I ate loads!
