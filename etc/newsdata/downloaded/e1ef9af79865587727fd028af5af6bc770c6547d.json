Its use has increased 20-fold in the past 50 years and is expected to double again in the next 20 years.\n\nAlmost everybody in the world comes into contact with it -- over a quarter of all plastic is used for packaging, the most popular use of the material.\n\nBut only 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling. The reuse rate is terrible compared to other materials -- 58% of paper and up to 90% of iron and steel gets recycled.\n\nRelated: World is facing the worst risk in a generation\n\nIt gets worse. Almost a third of all plastic packaging escapes collection systems and ends up in nature or clogging up infrastructure.\n\n\"After a short first-use cycle, 95% of plastic packaging material value, or $80 billion to $120 billion annually, is lost to the economy,\" the WEF said in a report.\n\nThe report is based on interviews with over 180 experts and on analysis of over 200 reports.\n\nThey estimate that by 2050, the amount of plastics produced globally will increase three times to 1,124 million tons. By then, the \"plastic economy\" will take up 15% of the world's global carbon budget, compared to just 1% today.\n\nThe so-called carbon budget is the total amount of carbon dioxide the world can pump into the atmosphere while still having a chance of stopping short of 2 degrees of global warming.\n\nThe forum said the only way to avoid a disaster is to massively improve the economics and uptake of recycling. That means giving people incentives to collect plastic garbage and recycle, use reusable packaging, and encourage countries to drastically improve their waste collection infrastructure, to avoid plastic garbage leaking into the nature.", "description": "There will be more plastic than fish in the world's oceans by 2050, the World Economic Forum has warned.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasova"], "top_image": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160119094729-plastic-bottle-floating-ocean-780x439.jpg", "published_at": "2016-01-19"}
