Rob Homer\n\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority ruled Mr Gordon breached the 'one-to-a-market' rule, which limits an entity from having more than one television licence in a market. Under media control laws in the Broadcasting Services Act, Mr Gordon is prevented from owning more than 15 per cent of Prime because he already wholly owns WIN.\n\nACMA found Mr Gordon took his total shareholding in Prime to 26.6 per cent, above the 15 per cent threshold he is legally allowed to own.\n\nHowever, as foreshadowed by The Australian Financial Review earlier this month, ACMA ruled the move was an accident because a cash-settled share swap, which allows somebody to have an economic interest in a company without controlling the shares, was not properly executed by a third party.\n\nACMA found Mr Gordon could not have reasonably known he was in breach of media control laws and the WIN Corp owner took steps to remedy the matter as soon as he was made aware. It found no evidence Mr Gordon took steps to exercise control over Prime.", "description": "The media watchdog won't punish media mogul Bruce Gordon for a bungle which caused him to breach media ownership limits.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e117e5539423471cb9d9144576e86b7cae4e19c3", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
