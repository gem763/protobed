(Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)\n\nUNIONDALE, N.Y. \u2014 Barry Trotz was at the draft table in 2015 when the Washington Capitals made a surprising choice with their first-round selection, taking a goaltender that high for the first time in nearly a decade. But Trotz, then the team\u2019s head coach, had heard that Ilya Samsonov was special from people outside of the organization \u2014 that, at 18 years old, the Russian was ahead of where Tampa Bay star netminder Andrei Vasilevskiy was at that age.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous young man,\u201d said Trotz, now the coach of the New York Islanders. \u201cHe\u2019s got size; he\u2019s athletic; he\u2019s been coached very well. I know he\u2019s got a real bright future.\u201d\n\nThat NHL future began to be realized Friday night, when Samsonov, 22, beat the Islanders in his debut, 2-1. He finished with 25 saves in a game that could, one day, mark the start of a new era in net for the Capitals. The team reassigned incumbent backup Pheonix Copley to the American Hockey League after he cleared waivers Thursday, settling on Samsonov in large part because, with Braden Holtby in the final year of his contract, Washington wants to see what it has in Samsonov before deciding on Holtby\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to be more nervous, but no, I felt normal,\" Samsonov said in a Russian-language interview. \u201cThe guys all helped and said there\u2019s nothing scary. I felt great, it was a good game, and I\u2019m happy we won.\u201d\n\n[Martin Fehervary modeled his game on Michal Kempny's. Now they're teammates.]\n\nCaptain Alex Ovechkin was the first to pull Samsonov into an embrace on the ice after the final horn sounded. Then in the locker room, Samsonov donned a Washington Nationals batting helmet \u2014 teammates award it to one player after every win \u2014 and as is tradition for Capitals rookies who have something to celebrate, he got a towel of shaving cream smeared into his face by Capitals forward Tom Wilson.\n\nSamsonov\u2019s night began with a different ritual, skating onto the Nassau Coliseum ice all alone for warmups, a tradition for players making their big league debut. Rather than take a solo lap, he skated right over to a spot in front of Washington\u2019s bench and started stretching, flashing that poised, cool presence Coach Todd Reirden has praised so often.\n\nBut after forward Jakub Vrana lifted the Capitals to a 1-0 lead with his second goal in as many games, the first goal-against of Samsonov\u2019s career was the epitome of a bad bounce. A pass from New York\u2019s Devon Toews deflected off two Washington players before caroming off defenseman Radko Gudas\u2019s skate and past Samsonov 12:27 into the game. T.J. Oshie restored the Capitals\u2019 lead with a power-play goal in the second period, and it held up with eight saves by Samsonov in the third frame.\n\nWith Holtby, 30, due to become an unrestricted free agent after this season, Washington felt urgency to see Samsonov in NHL games and determine whether he really is the team\u2019s goaltender of the future. He has played just one year of North American professional hockey, but Samsonov\u2019s hot finish to his first season in the AHL \u2014 from Jan. 12 on, he posted a 15-3-1-1 record with a 1.78 goals against average and .948 save percentage \u2014 is what convinced Washington he was ready for this promotion. The trade-off is that his playing time is largely limited to spelling Holtby, either when the Capitals have two games in two nights or in relief if Holtby\u2019s hurt or struggling.\n\nSamsonov was tabbed the starter for Friday night\u2019s game because Washington wanted to save Holtby for its home opener Saturday, and after this set of back-to-back games, the Capitals won\u2019t have another until Oct. 24 and 25, potentially a 20-day wait until Samsonov\u2019s next start. Holtby, a Vezina Trophy winner in 2016, has played at least 54 regular-season games in each of the past five seasons.\n\nSamsonov is waivers-exempt, so the Capitals could shuttle him to Hershey and back occasionally to keep him playing regularly, but that doesn\u2019t appear to be their plan at this point. Reirden said the team has a projected goaltending schedule for the season, but it\u2019s flexible depending on how Samsonov performs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get some games, but the goal is to continue to develop and learn and grow,\u201d goaltending coach Scott Murray said. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a different league, but he\u2019s gotten better his whole career. That\u2019s the goal, and it\u2019s not stopping now. And he\u2019s got to continue to earn his ice time, just as he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nAcross the ice from Samsonov was Semyon Varlamov, the last goaltender the Capitals drafted in the first round and someone Samsonov has long looked up to. Samsonov said the two had dinner together once in Russia and exchanged a few texts and phone calls in the past, with Varlamov offering advice on how to get used to life in North America and in the NHL. Samsonov is now experiencing it all for himself, including getting the better of his idol Friday night.\n\n\u201cI thought he played great,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe looked very comfortable in there. I\u2019m not surprised. That\u2019s how he\u2019s looked this year in particular since he\u2019s returned. Just the composure that he has, the confidence that he gives the bench, he definitely looks the part. He was the part for sure tonight.\u201d", "description": "Washington drafted Russian in the first round of the 2015 NHL draft.", "authors": ["Isabelle Khurshudyan", "Reporter Covering The Washington Capitals", "October At Pm", "Isabelle Khurshudyan Covers The Washington Capitals.
