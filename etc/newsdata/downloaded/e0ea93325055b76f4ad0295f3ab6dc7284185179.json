Not for us say Tanzania's small-scale miners", "language": "en", "text": "By Helen Reid, Barbara Lewis and Emmanuel Herman\n\nTANGA, Tanzania Oct 30 (Reuters) - A new network of government-controlled trading centres was meant to ensure Tanzania's small-scale miners got a bigger share of the country's mineral wealth. But most still can't get a foot in the door. Literally.\n\nEntry to the 28 exchanges scattered around the East African nation is restricted to those who can afford the licenses needed to sell the precious metals, which at around $44, is beyond the means of most small-scale miners who often run up debts just to extract gold and other precious metals from rented land.\n\nThat means they are effectively excluded from trading on these formal marketplaces \u2013 the centerpiece of President John Magufuli\u2019s drive to curb the black market in mineral wealth.\n\nMagufuli has built his base by promising to empower poor Tanzanians, and his attempts to formalise the sale of gold and other minerals are seen as progressive compared to other countries, such as neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, where there have been violent crackdowns https://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-mining-insight/send-in-the-troops-congo-raises-the-stakes-on-illegal-mining-idUSKCN1UC0BS) on informal miners.\n\nThe new mineral trading centres make pricing more transparent, but there is no law that guarantees the miners a fair share.\n\nInstead, the new system has strengthened the position of pit owners and, in particular, the middlemen who help finance them, according to small-scale miners, analysts and non-governmental organizations.\n\nIt has also poured money from royalties and clearance fees into government coffers since its inception in March.\n\nKnown locally as dealers or brokers, middlemen have traditionally controlled Tanzania\u2019s vast informal mining sector, through the loans they make to miners and pit owners and their ownership of many of the facilities used to process the gold.\n\nDealers own the majority of the trading licenses needed to buy minerals in the exchanges, and pit owners own the majority of the mining licenses needed to sell in them, according to Tanzania's Mining Commission, which is the government department that issues the licenses and oversees the industry.\n\n\"The concern is we have a new class of mining entrepreneurs,\" said Edward Hobey-Hamsher, analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a consultancy.\n\n\"It's the workers at the bottom who are the most vulnerable and will continue to be.\"\n\nSince 2000, 29,000 mining licenses have been distributed, including 3,000 between July 1 2018 and June 31 2019, according to Professor Shukrani Manya, head of the Mining Commission.\n\nThat compares to an estimated 6 million people who work as informal miners, according to The Tanzania Mines, Energy, Construction and Allied Workers\u2019 Union (TAMICO), mostly mining gold after its price rose 16% this year.\n\nIn a statement, TAMICO said it did not see dealers as obstacles to fair prices for miners but said they would have higher earnings if they bargained collectively, in a union.\n\nThomas Munis, chairman of the Tanzania Mineral Dealers' Association (TAMIDA), denied that dealers, who number around 50,000 in Tanzania, exploited miners.\n\n\"These arrangements with the artisanal miners are legally binding and everyone is protected by the contracts signed,\" he said on the sidelines of a meeting of small-scale miners in Tanga, a port city north of the capital, Dar es Salaam.\n\n\"There is no chance for anyone to be exploited.\"\n\nThe Minister for Minerals Doto Biteko did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nA FAIR SHARE\n\nArtisanal mining plays a key role in the wider mining sector because it can rapidly increase supply when prices rise. But it is dangerous with frequent accidents and the risk of contamination from the use of mercury, a highly poisonous substance, to recover gold particles from soil.\n\nIt can also be a hard way to make a living.\n\nEven before they put a shovel in the ground, miners have to pay rent on the land they dig, which works out at around 45,000 Tanzanian shillings ($19.58) per year per acre, according to TAMICO, a large amount in a country where the average annual income is around $881, according to a 2017 analysis by the World Bank.\n\nInstead of a regular wage, miners have production-sharing arrangements with pit owners. The pit owners, in turn, often give the dealers the right to process the metal and sell it on, because they are in debt to them.", "description": "A new network of government-controlled trading centres was meant to ensure Tanzania's small-scale miners got a bigger share of the country's mineral wealth.
