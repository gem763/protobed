When you think about it, every upcycled garment is a bespoke work of art, regardless of what the source materials may be.\n\nFast fashion and endless reproduction has the environment in a vice-like grip, and so there\u2019s greater demand than ever for designers to look deeper into what\u2019s already been put out into the world and find a way to make something new from it. Enter i-D\u2019s new series, Tear It Up!. Every week, we hand a mound of old clothing and found materials to a designer we love and ask them to create a one-of-a-kind new piece from it.\n\nIn the series\u2019 first episode, we ask i-D favourite Matthew Needham to put his skills into action in front of our lens. As a renowned lover of found materials who truly personifies sustainability in the fashion world, he\u2019s the perfect talent to transform what would be landfill into a singular work of art. Watch as he spins rope around ripped up cotton, and creates a crinoline silhouette from bits of rubbish.\n\n\u201cUpcycling is an inherent part of my work,\u201d Matthew tells i-D. \u201cBut at the same time, doing it under the time constraints and with those materials was quite fun actually! In this environment, we need to reiterate the idea of positive change through projects like Tear It Up!, where we promote creativity in its rawest sense, and put it out into the world as both a method of change and a positive influence for the future.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, at the end of the series you\u2019ll have the rare opportunity to buy the pieces created by i-D\u2019s hand-selected designers via Depop. So stay tuned. A piece of fashion history could soon be yours.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "\u2018Tear It Up!\u2019 sees young designers transform the old into the new.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d95f84141b06d000965047a/lede/1570110543017-Screen-Shot-2019-10-03-at-143953.png?crop=1xw:0.9576740506329114xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
