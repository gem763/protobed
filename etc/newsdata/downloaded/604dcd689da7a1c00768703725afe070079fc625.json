But does social media manipulation affect voters and elections in the United States? That question is still unanswered.\n\n\u201cThe reason we don't know is because we're not measuring it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe simply don't have access to the data we would need to not only look retrospectively at 2016 or 2018, but to think proactively about 2020.\u201d\n\nAral said we can measure it with tools that have already been developed, we just need access to the data. In a recent MIT study, Aral and his colleague Dean Eckles broke down four steps that would help experts determine the effects of social media manipulation on voter turn out and voter choice.\n\nAccording to the authors, researchers need to examine users exposure to manipulative media, observe how that data affected voter behavior, assess the effect of the manipulative messages on behavior and examine the consequences of changes in voting behavior for election outcomes.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, Facebook struggled with questions about election interference and misinformation on the platform. Since then, the social network has set up \u201cwar-rooms\u201d to find false content and bad advertisements. The company also recently cracked down on advertisers. It will require advertisers to submit proof that they are registered with the U.S. government. Smaller businesses will need to provide a verifiable phone number and business email address, the company said.\n\n\u201cFacebook had promised to deliver data to researchers but that has been tremendously delayed,\u201d said Aral.\n\nThe bigger problem is these social media companies are being asked \u201cto open the kimono and simultaneously lock everything down and secure data. Platforms will have to become more secure and transparent at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we fund and pursue this agenda,\u201d said Aral, referring to the proper research. \u201cWe will learn how to protect democracy. Without it, democracies will remain vulnerable to foreign and domestic attacks worldwide.\u201d\n\nValentina Caval is a producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "David Austen, professor of management at MIT, talked to Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move about preventing elections from getting hacked.", "authors": ["Valentina Caval"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TNPrqTiVX5MuvRgCrLe1zw--~B/aD0yNDIyO3c9MzYzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/2e8432c0-cb62-11e9-9d7f-efb2b363c375", "published_at": "2019-08-31"}
