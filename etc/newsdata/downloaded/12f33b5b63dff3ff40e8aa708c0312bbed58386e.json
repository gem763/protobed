Matt Schaefer established this beyond a doubt in a Twitter thread in the immediate aftermath of the West Texas shooting spree. He said that he wouldn\u2019t use \u201cthe evil acts of a handful of people to diminish the God-given rights of my fellow Texans.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nProgressives were agog at Shaefer\u2019s sentiment, and when actress Alyssa Milano questioned how he possibly could defend it, Texas Senator Ted Cruz jumped in to support Shaefer\u2019s argument (in less obnoxious terms).\n\nThe basic proposition actually isn\u2019t hard to defend, and indeed it is written into our fundamental documents. This doesn\u2019t mean that God wants you to own an AR-15, or that every jot and tittle of our current gun regime is divinely mandated. Far from it. Yet there is a natural right to self-defense and gun ownership is inherently connected to that right in a modern society.\n\nThis is glossed over or denied even by Democrats who have a connection to America\u2019s culture of gun ownership. On \u201cMorning Joe\u201d the other day, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said, \u201cI look at [gun legislation] and I always say, \u2018Does this hurt Uncle Dick in his deer stand?'\u201d That\u2019s not really the question, though. The Second Amendment isn\u2019t fundamentally about Uncle Dick bagging deer, but about his ability to defend himself and his family.\n\nThe notion of God-given rights shouldn\u2019t be controversial. It is a bedrock of the American creed, written into the Declaration of Independence. It\u2019s preamble says, of course, that all men \u201care endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Usually no one bats an eyelash at rhetoric based on this formulation. In his inaugural address, John F. Kennedy said \u201cthe same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought are still at issue around the globe\u2014the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.\u201d\n\nThe Bill of Rights puts flesh on the bones of those \u201cunalienable rights\u201d of life and liberty, and \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms\" is one of them. Gun-ownership is one of them.\n\nWhy? Because the founders believed, rightly, that everyone has an inherent right to self-defense.\n\nJohn Locke, the English philosopher influential with the founders, wrote:\n\n\u201cI should have a right to destroy that which threatens me with destruction: for, by the fundamental law of nature, man being to be preserved as much as possible, when all cannot be preserved, the safety of the innocent is to be preferred.\u201d\n\nAs David Hirsanyi notes in his history of the gun in America, First Freedom, John Adams said in his defense of one of the British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre in 1770, self-defense was \u201cthe primary canon in the law of nature.\u201d\n\nOwning a gun is an extension of this law of nature, and has been recognized as such for a very long time in Anglo-America. The right to bear arms had deep roots in England, and predated the Constitution on these shores. The colony of Pennsylvania guaranteed the right. In his draft of the Virginia Constitution in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201cNo freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.\u201d (His language wasn\u2019t adopted.)\n\nIt is out of this historical and jurisprudential soil that we got the Second Amendment. Guns would make it possible for Americans to defend themselves, and to defend their liberties.\n\nAlexander Hamilton wrote in The Federalist of the importance of \u201cthe original right of self-defense which is paramount to all positive forms of government.\u201d This right can be used if necessary, per Hamilton, \u201cagainst the usurpations of the national rulers.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an outlandish idea, rather a commonplace. As the great writer and reformer Noah Webster put it, \u201cThe supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States.\u201d\n\nIt is a canard that the Second Amendment contemplates gun ownership only in the context of militias.\n\nIt clearly guarantees an individual right to bear arms. It uses the word \u201cpeople,\u201d which appears in other amendments denoting individual rights (see the Fourth, Ninth and 10th Amendments).\n\nThere was no doubt about this at the time. As Harsanyi writes, \u201cnot a single soul in the provisional government or at the Second Continental Congress or any delegate at the Constitutional Convention\u2014or, for that matter, any new American\u2014ever argued against the idea of individuals owning a firearm.\u201d\n\nThe great legal commentaries of the 19th century expressed this understanding.\n\nIt was only later that the Second Amendment came to be considered essentially an ink blot, before its true meaning was excavated by scholars on the left and the right.\n\nNone of this is necessarily a trump card in the gun-control debate. Whatever their merits, the most commonly proposed gun-control restrictions wouldn\u2019t substantially lessen gun ownership in this country. It does mean, however, that there is a limit to how far gun control can go in America, and that proponents of new restrictions should be fully aware that they are tampering with a constitutionally protected individual right. Again, if not every proposed new limit is be unconstitutional, the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t have lesser status than the First.\n\nIf Uncle Dick likes to hunt, good for him. But his right to own a firearm doesn\u2019t begin or end there.\n\n", "description": "Owning a gun is an extension of this law of nature, and has been recognized as such for a very long time in Anglo-America.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/46/b0/5affa5814e4ba83604962fe537c9/190904-guns-ap-773.jpg"}
