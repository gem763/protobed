The pursuit is celebrated in Russian literature including Leo Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d.", "description": "Moscow (AFP) \u2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin is renowned for posing for high-octane photo opportunities like tiger-tracking or deepwater diving.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/a9673b_russian-president-vladimir-putin-poses-mini-break-in-mountains-yenisei-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
