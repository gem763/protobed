Even in the face of a military success, reporters don\u2019t have to check their skepticism at the door.\n\nSome of the criticism focused on Trump\u2019s freewheeling, 40-minute news conference. As I said on the air Sunday, any other president would have made his solemn speech and walked off. Instead, Trump reveled in taking questions from reporters.\n\nPENTAGON SAYS MILITARY DOG INJURED IN AL-BAGHDADI RAID 'FULLY RECOVERING'\n\nThe Washington Post said that unlike Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cmeasured tones\u201d in announcing the death of Osama bin Laden, when he spoke about American values, Trump created a \u201cspectacle\u201d that displayed \u201covert showmanship, blunt language and airing of personal gripes.\u201d\n\nCNN ran a piece titled \u201cThe 41 most shocking lines from Donald Trump\u2019s Baghdadi announcement.\u201d\n\nIt was bracing to hear Trump say al-Baghdadi was a \u201ccoward\u201d who \u201cdied like a dog,\u201d \u201cwhimpering\u201d and \u201ccrying.\u201d But that kind of humiliating talk may well have been a way of sending other terrorists a message.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t need to take a victory lap at the presser, but that\u2019s his rough-and-tumble style. Much of the media still want Trump to be \u201cdignified,\u201d but that\u2019s not how he got elected and that\u2019s not what his supporters want. It shouldn\u2019t detract from this military success\u2014and if he raid had failed and Americans had been killed, the press wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to pin the blame on Trump.\n\nA New York Times news story said the raid \u201coccurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nThat feels like a loaded line. But it involved the legitimate question of whether Trump\u2019s pullout of troops from northern Syria \u201cdisrupted the meticulous planning underway and forced Pentagon officials to speed up the plan for the risky night raid\u201d against al-Baghdadi.\n\nAnd it\u2019s equally fair to question whether the troop withdrawal will make it harder to mount future counterterrorism operations, as well as whether ISIS will still be a threat after the death of its leader.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nFor many people, the awful Washington Post headline on an obit of al-Baghdadi captured a media mindset that is hard to fathom.\n\nThe original headline was fine, describing him as ISIS\u2019 \u201cterrorist-in-chief.\u201d But some editor thought it would be a good idea to change it, so this wasn\u2019t a rushed mistake on deadline.\n\nThe new headline: \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48.\"\n\nAustere religious scholar.\n\nThe headline was offensive and amounted to whitewashing the reality that this was a brutal mass murderer who specialized in public beheadings and setting people on fire in cages. To use those words was unthinkable.\n\nPost spokeswoman Kris Coratti Kelly tweeted that \u201cthe headline should never have read that way and we changed it quickly.\u201d That was after a fierce online backlash. Coratti also told CNN that \u201cPost correspondents have spent years in Iraq and Syria documenting ISIS savagery, often at great personal risk,\u201d and the headline didn\u2019t reflect that brutality.\n\nAl-Baghdadi had not been seen in recent years, and ISIS is a diminished force, thanks to the Trump administration and our Kurdish allies. Still, his death is an important milestone in the war on terror. But many media outlets seem anxious to return to the impeachment narrative.", "description": "The initial burst of positive coverage of President Trump for the killing of the leader of ISIS has quickly dissolved into grudging praise mixed with mocking potshots.", "authors": ["Howard Kurtz", "Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst", "The Host Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/28/694940094001_6098563339001_6098561102001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
