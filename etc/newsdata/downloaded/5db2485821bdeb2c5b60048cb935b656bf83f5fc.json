REUTERS/Juda Ngwenya/File Picture\n\nFollowing are reactions to his death from Zimbabwe and around the world.\n\nZIMBABWE PRESIDENT EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cCde (Comrade) Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT CYRIL RAMAPHOSA\n\n\u201cSouth Africans join the people and government of Zimbabwe in mourning the passing of a liberation fighter and champion of Africa\u2019s cause against colonialism.\n\n\u201cUnder President Mugabe\u2019s leadership, Zimbabwe\u2019s sustained and valiant struggle against colonialism inspired our own struggle against apartheid and built in us the hope that one day South Africa too would be free.\n\n\u201cDuring the decades of our own struggle, Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation movement supported our own liberation movement to fight oppression on multiple fronts. After Zimbabwe achieved independence, the apartheid state brutalised and violated Zimbabwe as punishment for supporting our own struggle.\n\n\u201cMany Zimbabweans paid with their lives so that we could be free. We will never forget or dishonour this sacrifice and solidarity.\u201d\n\nSPOKESWOMAN FOR BORIS JOHNSON, PRIME MINISTER OF FORMER COLONIAL POWER BRITAIN\n\n\u201cThere will be mixed emotions in Zimbabwe at today\u2019s news. We of course express our condolences to those who mourn but know that for many he was a barrier to a better future. Under his rule the people of Zimbabwe suffered greatly as he impoverished their country and sanctioned the use of violence against them.\n\n\u201cHis resignation in 2017 marked a turning point and we hope that today marks another which allows Zimbabwe to move on from the legacy of its past and become a democratic, prosperous nation that respects the human rights of its citizens.\u201d\n\nHARARE RESIDENT ONWELL SAMUKANYA\n\n\u201cHe was an icon, he was an African legend. His only mistake was that he overstayed in power. You can\u2019t have somebody that\u2019s 89 and 90 still being the president, you have to give others a chance.\u201d\n\nZIMBABWEAN OPPOSITION SENATOR AND RIGHTS LAWYER DAVID COLTART, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cHe was a colossus on the Zimbabwean stage & his enduring positive legacy will be his role in ending white minority rule & expanding a quality education to all Zimbabweans.\u201d\n\nNELSON CHAMISA, LEADER OF ZIMBABWE\u2019S MAIN OPPOSITION PARTY THE MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cMy condolences to the Mugabe family and Africa for the passing on of Zimbabwe\u2019s founding President. This is a dark moment for the family because a giant among them has fallen. May the lord comfort them.\n\n\u201cEven though I and our party, the MDC, and the Zimbabwean people had great political differences with the late former President during his tenure in office, and disagreed for decades, we recognise his contribution made during his lifetime as a nation\u2019s founding President.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to say for a life of 95 years and national leadership spanning over 37 years but in the true spirit of Ubuntu, we would like to give this moment to mourning but there will be time for greater reflection.\u201d\n\nJULIUS MALEMA, LEADER OF RADICAL LEFT SOUTH AFRICAN OPPOSITION PARTY THE ECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTERS, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saddened by the passing of our martyr & giant of the African Revolution (comrade) President Robert Mugabe. Let\u2019s continue to fight & protect his legacy. We must not allow our enemies to tell us how to remember him; we know our heroes.\n\n\u201cMay his soul rest in revolutionary peace.\u201d\n\nNAMIBIAN PRESIDENT HAGE GEINGOB\n\n\u201cAs Namibians, we owe President Mugabe a deep sense of gratitude for his immense and selfless contributions to the liberation of our country ... The loss of the people of Zimbabwe is Africa\u2019s loss.\n\nCHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN GENG SHUANG\n\nGeng said Mugabe was an outstanding liberation movement leader and statesman for Zimbabwe who had defended his country\u2019s independence, opposed foreign interference and promoted good cooperation with China.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by his passing and express sincere sympathies to the Zimbabwean people, government and to Mr. Mugabe\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nHARARE RESIDENT SELLINA MUGADZA\n\n\u201cHe was a good leader. He was a good leader. Of course we know that you cannot do good to everyone, but to me he was good.\u201d\n\nKENYAN PRESIDENT UHURU KENYATTA\n\n\u201cIn this moment of sorrow, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family, his relatives and the people of Zimbabwe who, for many years, he served with commitment and dedication.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey the magnitude of the loss as former President Mugabe was an elder statesman, a freedom fighter and a Pan-Africanist who played a major role in shaping the interests of the continent ... a man of courage who was never afraid to fight for what he believed in even when it was not popular.\u201d\n\nTANZANIAN PRESIDENT JOHN MAGUFULI\n\n\u201cAfrica has lost one of its bravest and Pan-Africanist leaders, who led by example in opposing colonialism.\u201d\n\nZIMBABWEAN DEPUTY MINISTER OF INFORMATION ENERGY MUTODI, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cRest in Peace President Robert Mugabe. There is no doubt you were an African icon, a statesman of a rare character and a revolutionary.\u201d\n\nMPHO BALOPI, SECRETARY GENERAL, BOTSWANA DEMOCRATIC PARTY\n\n\u201cCde Mugabe was one of Africa\u2019s most renowned freedom fighters and also one of the founding fathers of what is today known as SADC (the intergovernmental Southern African Development Community, whose headquarters are in Botswana).\n\n\u201cThe history of our respective parties\u2019 fraternal relations would be incomplete without mention of Uncle Bob, as he was affectionately known. It is beyond any doubt that he leaves an indelible mark on the politics of the region.\u201d\n\nZAMBIAN RULING PARTY THE PATRIOTIC FRONT QUOTES PRESIDENT EDGAR LUNGU IN A FACEBOOK POST\n\n\u201cI am saddened at the passing of a Pan-Africanist, Zimbabwe\u2019s founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe.\n\n\u201cHe will be remembered for his fight for Africa\u2019s liberation and standing up to fearlessly defend a continent he loved ... His place in the annals of Africa\u2019s political history is well assured.\u201d\n\nNIGERIAN PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI\n\n\u201cThe President commiserates with family members, friends and political associates of the political activist who fought for the independence of the country from colonial rule, and lived most of his life in public service.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari believes Mugabe\u2019s sacrifices, especially in struggling for the political and economic emancipation of his people, will always be remembered by posterity.\u201d\n\nNASIR AHMAD EL-RUFAI, GOVERNOR OF NIGERIA\u2019S KADUNA STATE, ON TWITTER\n\n\u201cHe started very well, stayed too long and ended tragically.
