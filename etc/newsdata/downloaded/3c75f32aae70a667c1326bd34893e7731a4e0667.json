She was shaking and barely could speak.\n\n'After we realised what happened, my husband and I ran outside and found that man.\n\n'After a huge quarrel, the worker opened his van and showed us Barsik.

Then he killed her dog.'\n\nAccording to Ms Keller, 'the animal control workers kill everything that moves with poison darts and are paid by their unit for each corpse'.\n\nA woman living next door to the Risbibi family said about their killed dog: 'Barsik was an amazingly smart dog.\n\n'He would accompany Shynali to school and back home after classes.\n\n'He would lay on the ground near the girl\u2019s feet making her wait for the green light at the intersection.\n\n'He never barked at anyone. Was very affectionate and friendly.\n\n'Everybody in our neighbourhood knew him and liked.'", "description": "An eight-year-old girl in Kazakhstan witnesses an Animal Control warden shoot her pet dog dead with a poison dart as she heads to school in Taraz in the country's  southern Jambyl region.", "authors": ["Roksana Panashchuk For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/09/19681300-0-image-a-30_1571041609343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
