Apparently, some locals mistook the statues as being part of the attraction and found it to be disrespectful.\n\nHALLOWEEN HAUNTED HOUSE RELEASES PICTURES OF TERRIFIED VISITORS\n\nThe owners of the haunted house attraction took to Facebook to explain the situation. Their post began, \u201cFirst we want to apologize to anyone who's been offended by the pic of the statues. They have nothing and will never have anything to do with Nightmare On Wolcott Street. That's why they're placed on the back dock in front of the restoration shop and not at our front entrance of Nightmare on Wolcott Street.\u201d\n\nThe owners went to explain that most visitors wouldn\u2019t even see the statues, except for customers that park in their lot. They also confirmed to Fox News that the statues had been sitting in that location for about five years and hadn't ever been connected with the Halloween attraction until this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cOur blessed mother has never and will never be part of our haunted attraction,\u201d the post continued. \u201cThey're placed where they are at the restoration shop because we're planning to restore them and use them for an upcoming 2020 Christmas nativity scene. Isn't passing judgment before knowing the facts one of the biggest issues in today's society? All it does is cause chaos like this. The statues will be covered while Nightmare on Wolcott Street is open in hopes to bring some peace to this matter!!! Thank you!\u201d\n\nRenee Dearborn spoke with Fox News and confirmed the confusion had been cleared up. Thankfully, the controversy didn't seem to hurt business. While the weekend before Halloween usually has been busy, Dearborn confirmed that they saw an uptick in business this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nDearborn said she wanted to clarify that she couldn't attribute it all to the attraction's recent press. According to her, about half of the visitors hadn't even heard of the controversy.\n\nShe also confirmed to Fox News that once the last ticket is sold for the haunted house attraction, the plastic wrap will be coming off the statues.", "description": "This is why it\u2019s important not to mix up holidays.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/halloween-house.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
