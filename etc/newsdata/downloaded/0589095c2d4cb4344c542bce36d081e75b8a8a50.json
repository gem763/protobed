It surfaced for the first time in Asia more than a year ago, in China, before spreading to southeast Asian nations, such as Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nSevere damage to pig herds in China, the world's top pork producer, has disrupted global markets from pork to feed, including corn and soymeal.", "description": "East Timor reports African swine fever outbreaks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
