It just explains how Trump got elected and why he is, I think, the antidote for a lot of what ails us today,\u201d Mr. Hurt said Tuesday night during a book party. \u201cSo it is a good way to help convince people you love to get on board.\u201d\n\nAmong nearly 100 or so party attendees at the Historic Tune Inn in Southeast were former Rep. Robert Hurt, Virginia Republican and Charles\u2018 brother; former Rep. Barbara Comstock, Virginia Republican; and Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.\n\n\u201cCharlie was one of, if not the first journalist, who saw what I saw which was Donald Trump was a winner,\u201d said Mr. Lewandowski, who was on hand Tuesday night to sign copies of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s 448-page report.\n\nMr. Trump \u201cis winning and he is winning against all the odds, and it\u2019s not just the odds of the Democratic Party but by in large the mainstream media who continues to chastise him and not give him credit for the success that he had and this book talks about that, and I think it is important,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski added.\n\nMr. Hurt said his book, which was released in July, examines how the president has changed political language and how he takes on the media.\n\n\u201cIt is really funny because every day there is some new scandal or some new thing the media freaks out about and says about Donald Trump. And he reveals, in my estimation, why he is still winning so the title remains relevant and I think will remain relevant,\u201d Mr. Hurt said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
