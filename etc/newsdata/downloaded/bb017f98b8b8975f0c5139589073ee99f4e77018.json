The crowd gasped, Vahaamahina was shown a red card, and the Welsh were given hope from nowhere.\n\nIt took until about five minutes from time for them to take advantage, though, with Ross Moriarty barging over from close range for a converted try after a French scrum was shoved back near their own line.\n\nWales led for the first time in the match at 20-19 and held on to the final whistle, which was met by French bodies slumping to the ground in despair.\n\n\u201cCruel,\u201d said France captain Guilhem Guirado, shaking his head.\n\nThe Welsh know the feeling.\n\nEight years ago, in the teams\u2019 only previous meeting at a World Cup, Wales had captain Sam Warburton sent off controversially for a tip-tackle and went onto lose 9-8 in the semifinals.\n\nCall it belated payback.\n\n\u201cThat was nowhere near our best,\u201d Wales winger George North said, \u201cbut it\u2019s knockout rugby. You have to be in it to win it. We had self-belief to get it done, but that was too close to comfort for our liking.\u201d\n\nThe Welsh advanced to the semifinals for just the third time and will meet South Africa - a 26-3 winner against Japan in Tokyo hours later - in Yokohama on Sunday. They\u2019ll likely need to play much better.\n\nMeanwhile, the French and their departing coach Jacques Brunel leave Japan wondering how victory slipped from their grasp.\n\nBrunel had no qualms about the red card - \u201cI think it\u2019s a reflex on his part,\u201d he said - but was unhappy about the game-defining scrum that produced the clinching try.\n\nAs France\u2019s retreating pack splintered, Wales\u2018 scavenging scrumhalf Tomos Williams ripped the ball out of the grasp of flanker Charles Ollivon, one of three French try-scorers in the first half.\n\nThe ball popped into the air - marginally forward - and into the hands of Justin Tipuric, who was held up just before the tryline. Moriarty gathered and barged over for a try converted by Dan Biggar after a review by the TMO.\n\n\u201cThe referees said it was a rip so there was no forward pass,\u201d Guirado said, \u201cbut we should have killed off the game before that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this game saw France at its classic best, showing flair in a dominant first-half performance before self-destructing in the second half.\n\n\u201cFrance were excellent today and very unlucky,\u201d said Wales coach Warren Gatland, whose 12-year tenure gets two more weeks as he looks to guide the rugby-mad country to a first World Cup title. \u201cBut I\u2019m proud of my players. They never give up.\u201d\n\nAn eighth Welsh win in the last nine meetings between the teams did not look on when France scored two tries in the opening eight minutes and then pushed ahead 19-10 in the 31st minute while Wales was briefly down to 14 men following Ross Moriarty\u2019s yellow card.\n\nFrance\u2019s first two tries mixed bludgeoning power with gracefulness, Vahaamahina burrowing over in the fifth minute before Ollivon finished off an 80-meter move that started with a break by the excellent Virimi Vakatawa just outside his own 22.\n\nWales was then gifted 10 points despite hardly having any territory or ball. A crunching tackle from Jake Ball on Guirado saw the ball fall loose and Wainwright picked it up to sprint over from 40 meters. Biggar converted, added a penalty, and suddenly Wales was only 12-10 behind.\n\nFrance got back on the front foot again and took advantage of Moriarty - on for the injured Josh Navidi - getting sin-binned for a high tackle. A minute later, Vakatawa sidestepped in from an offload by winger Damian Penaud and dived over for a brilliantly try.\n\nFlyhalf Romain Ntamack struck the post with a penalty and two more try-scoring openings were botched at the end of the first half by France\u2019s players, who looked frustrated to only turn around leading by nine points.\n\nThen came their self-inflicted implosion, sparked by Vahaamahina\u2019s moment of madness.\n\nEven then, Wales hardly entered the French 22 despite having a man extra and its attacking play was one-paced and unimaginative.\n\n\u201cThe better team lost today,\u201d Gatland said. \u201cWe just hung in there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Once again, a red card proved pivotal in a Rugby World Cup knockout match between Wales and France decided by just one point.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Douglas"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
