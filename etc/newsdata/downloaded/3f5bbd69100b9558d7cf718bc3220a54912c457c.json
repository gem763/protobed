It would be perfectly cast for a modern-day Cary Grant and Grace Kelly.\n\nThe new Continental GT Convertible is 'beautifully proportioned with a longer bonnet, lower nose and more streamlined profile', says Ray\n\nBeautifully proportioned with a longer bonnet, lower nose and more streamlined profile, than its predecessor, it is set off with elliptical rear lights.\n\nI watched in awe as one Spanish farmer far in the distance jumped from his tractor and ran full pelt across his field to the roadside to take a photograph of my approaching cabriolet on his phone, beaming as he expressed his joy, admiration, and one suspects a little twinge of envy.\n\nDesigned from the off as a standalone convertible, the Continental GT did rather suit me, I fancied. Even more so, if I could only just stretch to the \u00a3175,890 price tag, which is around \u00a316,000 up on the hard-top coupe.\n\nBut that is just the starting price. By the time you have factored in those oh-so tempting must-have extras, you will be looking well north of \u00a3200,000 for such a car.\n\nWealth, I feel, is wasted on the rich.\n\nThe interior of the Bentley is exquisitely crafted with materials of the highest quality, including lots of leather and wood\n\nHowever, they would get a sumptuously appointed convertible for that money. Every inch of surface, wood, leather, material or metal you touch screams tactile quality and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Bentley that I was driving was in a fetching tone called Cricket Ball, matched with a camel and beluga hide interior which also bowled me over, totting up in total to \u00a3215,330.\n\nThe revolving dashboard is inspired by the rotating number-plate gadget used in the James Bond movie Goldfinger\n\nThis included \u00a34,500 alone for the clever, but clearly expensive world\u2019s first three-way rotating dashboard that takes its inspiration from James Bond.\n\nA clever triangular device revolves to show one of three different dashboard faces \u2013 a plain veneer, a hi-tech 12.3-inch touch screen for sat-nav or media, or three analogue circular dials displaying outside temperature, a compass and a chronometer.\n\nIt is inspired by the rotating number-plate gadget used in the James Bond movie Goldfinger on 007\u2019s gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5 \u2013 using three faces, like on the distinctive packaging of the Toblerone bar of chocolate.\n\nThen there\u2019s another \u00a34,500 for the special paint option; \u00a36,195 for the touring specification, which includes lane-keeping assistance, night vision with an infrared camera, the vital (in my opinion) head-up windscreen display, pre-sense braking , and various other electronic aids; and \u00a36,500 for the high-end Naim audio.\n\nOn the open road the Continental GT Convertible soaks up the miles with style and ease\n\nBut never mind the stereo, fire up the convertible\u2019s start button and set off down the road and there\u2019s a wonderfully satisfying whoosh.\n\nPowered by the vast twin-turbo-charged 6.0 litre W12 petrol engine deploying 635PS (which equates to 626bhp) linked to a slinky and responsive 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, this near two-and-a-half-ton leviathan accelerates with controlled and seamless energy.\n\nTry this outside of Germany and you won\u2019t hold your driving licence for long\n\nIt goes from rest to 60mph in just 3.7 seconds and to 100mph \u2013 where permitted such as on derestricted German autobahns \u2013 in just 8.1 seconds. Top speed is 207mph, riding on 21-inch Pirelli P Zero tyres as standard, with 22 inch versions as option.\n\nBut here\u2019s the fly in the ointment. Try that outside of Germany and you won\u2019t hold your driving licence for long. And it doesn\u2019t take much more than a gentle press of your right foot for the speed to rise.\n\nWhich is why that head-up display showing both your speed and the prevailing speed limit is essential to help keep you legal and safe. It may even save your licence.\n\nTo help ensure that the convertible remains \u2018a Bentley for all seasons\u2019, a special neckwarmer is integrated into the heated comfort seats\n\nThat said, top up or down, the Bentley Continental GT Convertible does have impeccable manners around town and is not straining at the leash to break free.\n\nThere are three drive modes: Comfort for boulevarding around town; Bentley, or normal, for everyday driving; and Sport for enthusiastic engagement, plus the option for drivers to personalise their own settings. The sophisticated engine management system makes 300million software calculations per second.\n\nAn enhanced air suspension system promises improved ride comfort. And a special roll-control system boosts handling, especially on corners.\n\nThe exterior silver bright work from behind the front wheel that wraps around the car resembles both the outside exhaust pipes of old and is a nod to a running board.\n\nAt night the way ahead is lit by sparkling LED Matrix lighting with headlamps inspired by the finest cut-crystal glass designed to catch the light \u2018like a diamond.\u2019\n\nThe Continental GT Convertible can seat four adults and is designed to be a luxurious ride for all, top down or up\n\nUltimately, the convertible version of the Bentley Continental GT means it\u2019s a treat to have two cars for the price of one. At the push of a button you can open or close the Z-fold fabric roof in just 19 seconds at speeds of up to 30mph.\n\nA short but intense storm allowed me to try that out \u2013 and to experience the rather romantic pitter-patter of raindrops on the cossetting canvas roof \u2013 which is even available in traditional English tweed.\n\nBut it is with the top down for that exhilarating wind-in-the hair motoring that the convertible really comes into its own.\n\nTo help ensure that the convertible remains \u2018a Bentley for all seasons\u2019, a special neckwarmer is integrated into the heated comfort seats and blows warm air around the electrically adjustable headrests.\n\nThis combines with a heated steering wheel, seat heaters and new heated armrests, to keep driver and passengers snug, even with the top down in the freshest of weather.\n\nThe rear seat passengers also get a high level of craftmanship and luxury in the Bentley, although they do get less room than those in the front\n\nHowever, it still averages only a hefty and gas-guzzling 23 miles per gallon with CO2 emissions of 280g/km.\n\nTo help save some fuel and needless emissions, half the engine can shut down to run on six-cylinders, rather than 12. Stop-start and coasting technology allows the engine to rest when the vehicle is stationary and at near-stop speeds.\n\nBentley says the sound-proofing from the roof of the third generation convertible, mechanicals and noise-reducing tyres means that the convertible is quieter even than the previous hard-top coupe version of the Continental GT, but I did experience some wind noise from the windows at higher speeds.\n\nI'm sure that would be easy enough to live with.\n\nTop down. Foot down. Deposit down. (If I had the money).\n\nBentley Continental GT Convertible Price: from \u00a3175,890 Engine: 6.0 litre W12 12-cylinder petrol Power: 635 PS / 626bhp Gears: 8-speed dual clutch automatic 0-60mph: 3.7 seconds 0-100mph: 8.1 seconds Top speed: 207mph Length: 4,850mm Width: 2,187mm Height: 1,399mm Wheelbase: 2,851mm Kerb weight: 2,414kg Fuel economy: Average 23mpg Driving range: 399.5 miles\n\nLuxury touches for the well-heeled Bentley buyer\n\nIn September, we exclusively revealed pictures of two camouflaged versions of the new Bentley Continental GT cabriolet on test in a convoy, as part of their proving tests on UK roads.\n\nI had spotted and photographed in the Cotswolds and on the A40 near Oxford when the engineers topped to swap drivers.\n\nNow the car is on the market we can see the full effort Bentley has gone to make it stand out.\n\nInside, the driver and passengers are cossetted in a luxury handcrafted cabin featuring 10 square metres of veneer wood that takes nine hours to create and fit.\n\nThere are eight handcrafted standard veneers plus four dual veneers, 15 choices of interior trim hide, and 15 luxury carpet options, and 20-way adjustable seats with cooling, heating and massage functions.\n\nAmong the colours on offer is Orange Flame, designed for the Bentley buyer who really doesn't want to go unnoticed\n\nThere are also eight interior hood linings including red, blue and magnolia and, we were told, more than 310,000 stitches and a mile of thread.\n\nEnhancing the touchy-feely finesse there is also the option of a diamond-style pattern on knobs and trim, inspired by luxury Swiss watch-makers, called Cotes de Geneve \u2013 which is machined onto 0.6mm aluminium to create a three-dimensional technical finish.\n\nThere are 17 exterior colours as standard, including Beluga, Onyx and Portofino, with up to 70 in the extended range, plus countless bespoke options.\n\nOn the launch were exotic shades including Orange Flame, Windsor Blue, Silverlake, Barnato (after the Bentley Boy racer Woolf Barnato of the 1920s) .\n\nBentley also says the new Continental is the \u2018most technologically advanced\u2019 range they have ever produced \u2013 with 2,300 circuit boards, five miles of wiring, 92 electronic control units, and 100million lines of computer code , some 15 times the amount on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to make it all work.\n\nBentley boss Adrian Hallmark says the British luxury carmaker owned by VW is read for Brexit\n\n'All our Brexit planning is in place', says Bentley boss\n\nBentley, part of the giant German Volkswagen group, said it was proud that the new cabriolet and its engine had been \u2018designed, engineered and handcrafted in Britain\u2019.\n\nAnd the new convertible deserves to be a source of real pride to the 4,500-strong Bentley workforce at Crewe, including the many and growing number of young apprentices learning their craft whether with intricate hand-stitched leathers, wood, engineering or hi-tech digital electronics.\n\nBentley Motors chairman and chief executive Adrian Hallmark has set out the firm\u2019s path towards \u2018full electrification\u2019 of the Bentley range as the firm seeks to shed its gas-guzzler reputation.\n\nHallmark\u2019s stated aim is to have 100 per cent hybrid or electric power available on all models across the Bentley range by 2025. The new luxury hybrid sets Bentley \u2019on the path towards a sustainable electrified future,\u2019 he said.\n\nAs the UK nears the Brexit deadline of March 29, Mr Hallmark said a 'hard Brexit' would be 'a blow' but 'not life-threatening' to the company owned by Germany's giant Volkswagen group.\n\nIt is putting in place long- and short-term contingency plans to cope and remains 'fully committed' to the UK as it celebrates its centenary year. Only 20 per cent of Bentley's global sales are to Continental Europe so. It has a more balanced spread of sales.\n\nSome 21 per cent is to the USA, 19 per cent to China, 14 per cent remains in the UK and the remaining 16 per cent is exported to the result of the world.\n\nAnd a century after engineering genius Walter Owen, aka W.O, Bentley founded the firm bearing his name, Mr Hallmark said: 'All our Brexit planning is in place. The outlook for luxury cars is still positive.'\n\n'We have been here for 100 years and we will be here for the next 100 years.'", "description": "Not only does it drive well, but the Bentley Continental GT Convertible also comes with a clever party trick, a revolving panel to switch between dashboard options.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Mailonline And Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
