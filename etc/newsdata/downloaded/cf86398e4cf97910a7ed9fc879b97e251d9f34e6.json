(WeatherBell.com)\n\nThe tropics are active with a trio of systems brewing in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean: a tropical storm, a hurricane and a tropical depression.\n\nClosest to home is newly-named Tropical Storm Imelda in the western Gulf of Mexico (as of 1:45 p.m. eastern Tuesday), upgraded to a storm just 45 minutes after being designated a tropical depression (at 1 p.m. eastern). While the storm contains maximum sustained winds of around 40 mph, the biggest concern is its flood threat for the vulnerable Houston metro area.\n\nMore than half a foot of rain is set to fall in the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city during the next few days from this system as it approaches Houston from the Gulf of Mexico, sending multiple rounds of heavy thunderstorms slowly lumbering ashore. The National Weather Service cautions that some locations could see a foot or more of rain before this event ends Thursday, raising flash flood concerns. Rainfall rates in the heaviest bands could approach 3 inches per hour.\n\nAt the same time, Category 2 Hurricane Humberto is on its way to major hurricane status as it churns toward a position just north of Bermuda late in the week. A tropical storm warning is up for the island, as the storm is forecast to remain far enough away to spare it from its worst winds and heaviest rains.\n\nMeanwhile, an additional disturbance over the open tropical Atlantic has become a tropical depression and is forecast to become a tropical storm and then a hurricane in the coming days as it meanders west-northwestward. Assuming it reaches tropical storm-strength, it will be named Jerry. Computer models expect this storm to pass near or just north of the Lesser Antilles, but it\u2019s not yet clear where it will go from there.\n\nDangerous flood threat unfolding in Texas\n\nThe rain was already pouring down in buckets on the Texas Gulf Coast on Tuesday morning, where flash flood watches blanketed the greater Houston metro area.\n\nShower and thunderstorm activity will continue to blossom Tuesday from the Matagorda coast to Port Beaumont, with a couple bands of rainfall spreading into southwestern Louisiana. The flood risk in Louisiana, particularly from Sabine Lake through Lake Charles, is increasing as well.\n\nA widespread 5 to 10 inches, with localized higher amounts, may fall through Wednesday afternoon in the Houston-Galveston corridor.\n\nA tropical storm warning was posted for Sargent to Port Bolivar along Texas\u2019 coast, and includes Galveston.\n\n\u201cThe difference of just a few miles could be the difference of several inches of rain,\u201d the NWS wrote, stressing the highly variable nature of thunderstorm-driven rainfall totals. While 1- to 3-inch per hour rainfall rates are possible, they\u2019ll be realized only beneath the heaviest downpours. But where these downpours do repeatedly traverse the same areas, dangerous flash flooding and top-tier rainfall totals may result.\n\nLocalized Flood concerns with heavy showers coming in. FLOOD WATCH goes into effect at 1pm today. HEAVY RAIN threat lasts through Thursday. #Houston pic.twitter.com/EWf62g74vq \u2014 Jim Cantore (@JimCantore) September 17, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not out of the question that one or two very isolated locales pick up a foot and a half of rainfall.\n\nBy Thursday, uncertainty in the forecast increases. It will probably still be raining in Houston. But will the storm interact with some approaching energy aloft and shift the axis of heaviest rainfall farther east? That would be good news for the Interstate 45 corridor, but bad news for coastal Louisiana. While still not the most likely solution right now, the odds for that scenario have increased some since Monday. However, there\u2019s an equal or greater shot that the rains continue Thursday in the Houston area, as the area of low pressure over the Gulf strengthens some as it moves inland.\n\nThis latest episode underscores the fact that storms do not need to be a hurricane to be dangerous. Most recently, Hurricane Harvey painted a dire picture of what just water can do, with a record 60.58 inches on Nederland, Tex. With a price tag of $125 billion, it ties with Katrina as the costliest U.S. tropical cyclone on record. And most of the damage occurred when it was a tropical storm.\n\nThis time, Imelda could rank among the heaviest rainfall producers on record in some Houston suburbs. Have a plan to take action should a flash flood warning be issued for your location.\n\nHumberto to become major hurricane and sideswipe Bermuda\n\n\n\nHurricane Humberto moves east and may clip Bermuda. (TropicalTidbits.com)\n\nA tropical storm warning is up for Bermuda, where Humberto could make a close pass later this week.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the Category 2 storm was about halfway between the United States and Bermuda. According to the National Hurricane Center, \u201cHumberto is expected to become a major hurricane by [Tuesday night] or Wednesday morning.\u201d Humberto\u2019s cloud shield is nicking the coastal Carolinas, which are contending with rough surf and rip currents, but otherwise its impacts are largely relegated to the open ocean.\n\nOn the forecast track, Humberto is predicted to track well north of Bermuda on Wednesday night into Thursday, clipping the British island territory of 65,000 with its outermost rain bands. Tropical storm-force winds of greater than 39 mph are possible, along with rip currents and 1 to 3 inches of rain.\n\nTropical depression forms east of the Lesser Antilles\n\n\n\nWhat's soon to become Imelda is on a track that takes it ominously close to Puerto Rico and the Leeward Islands. It's likely to be named by Tuesday night. (NOAA/NHC)\n\nThe National Hurricane Center announced a new tropical depression formed Tuesday morning about midway between the Leeward Islands and Cape Verde. Forecasters at NHC say it\u2019s likely to become a tropical storm by Tuesday evening.\n\nThe incipient storm is on a track westwards, though a curve to the west-northwestward is anticipated as it intensifies. It may become a hurricane by late Thursday or Friday, with a track taking it ominously close to Puerto Rico and perhaps the southeastern Bahamas.\n\nThe track is uncertain at this point. However, models have been inching it closer to land masses, with the \u201cout to sea\u201d scenario a little bit less likely now. However, modeling weak tropical systems can be especially challenging until clearly defined circulation centers become better established, which should happen by Tuesday night.\n\nThis is a storm that needs to be closely watched in the days ahead.\n\nA sudden uptick?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that there will be a potentially significant uptick in Atlantic tropical storm and hurricane activity during the last week in September and extending through early October. The anticipated awakening of the tropical Atlantic is thanks to a overlap of weather systems that will encourage rising air over the Atlantic\u2019s main development region, to the west of Africa and east of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nThat will give an extra nudge to encourage any developing systems. Coupled with more favorable upper-level winds, the stage may be set for a turbo-boost to the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, leading to a few weeks that bear close watching.", "description": "A flash flood watch has been issued for the Houston metro area.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "September At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
