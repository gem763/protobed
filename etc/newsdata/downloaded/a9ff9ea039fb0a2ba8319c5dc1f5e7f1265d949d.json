His steps didn\u2019t make it seem as if he wanted to punch holes into the Nationals Park grass.\n\nNot this time. In the fourth inning of a critical start Tuesday night, Scherzer paced toward the rubber and flipped a fresh ball from his glove to his right hand. He wasn\u2019t in a particular rush. He had just given up a two-run homer to Joe Panik, which punctuated a four-run inning for the New York Mets, the biggest stain on Scherzer\u2019s final line.\n\nThe Washington Nationals eventually beat the Mets, 11-10, with the biggest ninth-inning comeback in franchise history. But what still mattered most for the Nationals \u2014 beyond the final score and way beyond any Cy Young race between Scherzer and Mets starter Jacob deGrom \u2014 was how Scherzer performed and then how he felt afterward.\n\n[Svrluga: Nationals\u2019 stunning rally over the Mets could be a springboard toward October]\n\nScherzer was lights out for five of his six innings, allowing no runs, no hits and a lone walk outside the fourth. His arm and body felt good once all the work was through. Yet those four runs on five hits in the fourth invited questions that will be tough to untangle: Was that inning just a regular lapse in a regular start? Or was it connected to Scherzer\u2019s recent injuries, the ones that have turned his summer into a test of patience and his ability to heal?\n\nThe 35-year-old ace didn\u2019t express much cause for concern.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a step forward. I felt like I was able to start bringing some intensity to the pitches, especially getting six innings,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of good in this start. In the fourth, [I] ran into kind of a buzz saw. They were able to get on some pitches and get a rally going.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s things I can sharpen up as I continue to ramp up intensity and everything follows suit. An outing like today, as much as you want to beat yourself up for it, was a step forward.\u201d\n\nThis was Scherzer\u2019s third start since he returned from the injured list Aug. 22. He missed close to seven weeks, save one late July appearance, with a list of diagnoses that included a mid-back strain, bursitis in the scapula below his right shoulder blade and a mild rhomboid muscle strain. They were sometimes referred to, collectively, as a back problem. Other times the word \u201cshoulder,\u201d far more daunting for a pitcher, crept into the public conversation.\n\nThe Nationals need Scherzer, their ace, at 100 percent. He has been steadily rebuilding his workload over the past two weeks. He threw 71 pitches in four innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates in his first start back. He lasted 18 more pitches, and went one out deeper, against the Baltimore Orioles six days later. Then he threw 90 against the Mets in his longest outing since July 6. He lobbied to stay in for the seventh but trusted Manager Dave Martinez\u2019s judgment. He felt that this outing set him up to throw 100 pitches or even a bit more when he faces the NL East-leading Braves in Atlanta on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI was able to start throwing pitches at 100 percent, start letting it eat,\u201d he said. \u201cReally started throwing some fastballs and really stepping on some fastballs and stepping on some off-speed pitches, as well. So for me, that was picking up the intensity on a per-pitch basis. It was definitely higher tonight than it was in the past two starts\u201d\n\nHe struck out five in the first three innings and faced just one batter over the minimum. His riding fastball set up well-commanded secondary stuff. But a second trip through the Mets\u2019 lineup was a speed bump. Then it was a full-on wall.\n\nScherzer had not allowed a hit entering the fourth. That changed when Pete Alonso and Michael Conforto started the inning with back-to-back singles. Alonso went with a first-pitch slider low and off the outside corner. Conforto stalked a first-pitch cutter on the outer half of the plate. Wilson Ramos followed with a double, extending his hitting streak to 26 games, and used a first-pitch fastball to do so. Only the pitch to Conforto would have been called a strike. The Mets handled them anyway. Then Brandon Nimmo lifted a sacrifice fly to center, bringing in another run, and Panik ambushed Scherzer yet again.\n\nGerardo Parra turned and sprinted after Panik\u2019s drive to right. But he slowed once his feet neared the warning track. Panik had gotten just enough of the 91-mph cutter to reach the first row of seats. Scherzer gave up a double to Luis Guillorme before finishing the inning. He bounced back with a quick fifth, retiring the side in order, and did the same in the sixth. His average fastball velocity was a normal 94.8. And his rough fourth, and the Mets\u2019 aggressive approach during it, was buried by history once the night was through.\n\nYet now the Nationals will see what reverberates past this start.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting better. He\u2019s definitely getting better,\u201d catcher Kurt Suzuki said. \u201cLet\u2019s think about it: The guy never went on a rehab start. This guy is pitching against the best competition out there as a so-to-say rehab. And he\u2019s going out there and giving us a chance to win every single time out.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nNationals score seven runs in ninth inning for wild comeback win against the Mets\n\nAfter four years and a gruesome injury, Nationals reliever Aaron Barrett is returning to the majors\n\nNationals add Michael A.
