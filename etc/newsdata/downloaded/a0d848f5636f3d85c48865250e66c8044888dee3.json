He earned support from fans and coach Carlo Ancelotti with his ability to score and create chances for others, and appeared set to triumph with the Spanish powerhouse.\n\nBut an injury and competition from his teammates led to falling minutes. He eventually lost his starting spot and became unhappy when Zinedine Zidane used him sparingly. He left in 2017 on a two-year loan for Bayern Munich.\n\nJames\u2019 future was up in the air again this past summer when Bayern opted not to exercise the option of buying his contract outright, sending him back to Madrid. Rumors abounded in the Spanish media that he would be shipped out to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid or Napoli to be reunited with Ancelotti.\n\nNeither of those moves materialized, though, and he started the season back with Madrid and its squad full of talented midfielders. James was facing an uncertain.\n\nBut injuries to Eden Hazard, Marco Asensio, Francisco \u201cIsco\u201d Alarc\u00f3n and Luka Modric, and the exit of Dani Ceballos, left Zidane in need of a healthy player to link up with his forwards.\n\nJames seemed clearly thrilled to get the opportunity on Saturday when he made his first start since returning to the club. He hustled when pressuring the ball, and showed his excellent playing skills, combining vision and passing precision to set up Karim Benzema for his second goal in a 3-2 win over Levante.\n\nNow he may have another chance to lead Madrid\u2019s attack when it visits Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League opener on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cYou can see he is very good. He is a player who has lots of talent,\u201d Zidane said Saturday. \u201cHe still needs to reach his peak fitness, but he left it all on the field with his aggressive attitude. I am happy for him.\u201d\n\nIS HE READY?\n\nBarcelona could start its European campaign at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday without Lionel Messi, who hasn\u2019t played since injuring his leg in the preseason.\n\nIn his place, 16-year-old Ansu Fati has become a fan favorite after scoring twice to set records for the youngest Barcelona player to score in the Spanish league and the youngest player to score at Camp Nou.\n\nThat leaves coach Ernesto Valverde with the intriguing question of whether Fati should take the next step and make his first appearance in the continent\u2019s elite competition.\n\nIf Messi does not recover in time, then Valverde will likely need to find somebody to accompany Luis Su\u00e1rez and Antoine Griezmann in attack. That could either be the versatile Sergi Roberto or reserve team player Carles P\u00e9rez.\n\nOr he could give his teen sensation another go at Dortmund.\n\n\u201cWith Ansu there is going to be a lot of hype and huge expectations, but we have to take the pressure off him. Our job is to protect the player,\u201d Valverde said after Fati scored once and set up another goal in a 5-2 win over Valencia on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI see that he is a boy who is focused. But it is not easy to play for Barca, and for someone as young as Ansu Fati it is even more difficult.\u201d\n\nBAD TIMING\n\nValencia is in chaos before it plays at Chelsea on Tuesday.\n\nOwner Peter Lim fired successful coach Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, who led the team to a Copa del Rey title last season, over Garc\u00eda\u2019s complaints that the club had not reinforced the squad to his liking.\n\nSeveral players voiced their disagreement with the decision on social media, and the team was beaten by Barcelona in its first match under new coach Albert Celades.\n\nNot the best situation before a high-profile trip to Stamford Bridge, where Valencia has not won in three visits.\n\nATLETICO WOMEN\n\nIn Spain\u2019s women\u2019s league, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid has started its bid for a fourth consecutive title in perfect fashion ahead of its showdown with Barcelona.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico won its second straight game to begin the campaign when it rolled past Sevilla 3-0.\n\nBarcelona needed a late penalty by Spain forward Jennifer Hermoso to salvage a 1-1 draw at Rayo Vallecano. Barcelona trails Atl\u00e9tico by two points in third place.\n\nBarcelona, a Champions League finalist last season, hosts Atl\u00e9tico next weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Having gone from star to cast-off at Real Madrid, Colombia midfielder James Rodr\u00edguez now has a second chance to regain a prominent role with the 13-time European Cup winners.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joseph Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/spain_soccer_la_liga_79353_c0-194-4620-2887_s1770x1032.jpg?8b9c31e39937b44ae2db19c389ad95344d0e5f8f", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
