Obviously, it is in NBC\u2019s hands and they made the decision they made,\u201d Mr. Yang added, according to the network.\n\nA spokesperson for SNL said earlier Monday that Mr. Gillis would not be joining the show\u2019s cast for its upcoming 45th season as previously planned, citing prior \u201coffensive, hurtful and unacceptable\u201d comments that came to light in the days since his hiring was announced last week.\n\nMr. Gillis repeatedly used racist and bigoted language during comedy podcasts that recently came to SNL\u2019s attention, including a May episode in which he used an ethnic slur for Asians while talking about Mr. Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. He has since apologized.\n\nMr. Yang, a 44-year-old tech entrepreneur, said earlier Monday that Mr. Gillis had recently reached out and that the two would likely be speaking together soon. He previously spoke out against calls for the comedian\u2019s firing, saying on Saturday that he favored \u201cbeing more forgiving rather than punitive.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
