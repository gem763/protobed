Hundreds of mostly young people were there, tightly surrounding a security circle for West and other musicians.\n\nAD\n\nThe rest of the campus was getting ready for a parade, football game and other homecoming events, and many streets were blocked off with police cars and barriers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGod, reveal the lies, let us stop feeling victimized, show my people the way, show my people how to love, forgive and pray,\u201d West said following a few traditional African American hymns, such as \u201cThere is a Balm in Gilead,\u201d and his 2009 hit \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d\n\nWest also focused on some core concerns of black Americans, lamenting the high number of African Americans in prison, something he framed as a deliberate plot. \u201cWhy lock people up? They need people to make more slaves \u2026 I got family locked up!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA voice in the crowd yelled, \u201cWe all got family locked up!\u201d\n\nA big focus of the service \u2014 like all the \u201cSunday services\u201d he started in 2019 \u2014 was that Christianity needs to be defined less strictly, and Christians shouldn\u2019t be divided.\n\n\u201cIf you believe Jesus died for your sins \u2014 that\u2019s the gospel!\u201d he said, lamenting various denominational differences. \u201cChristians, we\u2019re making it too hard for people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe plea for diversity wound its way at the end of the service to West himself, who has angered many African Americans for his public praise of President Trump.\n\nA poll released earlier this week by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found 4 percent of African Americans say they think Trump\u2019s actions have been good for African Americans in general, while 81 percent think he\u2019s made things worse,\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t always have to agree with me, but if they throw the slave nets again, how about we don\u2019t all stand in the exact same place?\u201d he said, triggering laughter in the crowd.\n\nThe crowd was a mix of Howard students and alums and other West fans from around the region. To some, politics were irrelevant at something they saw as a legitimate worship service for the modern, less judgmental set.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s expanding people\u2019s minds, that religion can come in all colors. You come as you are. You don\u2019t have to be perfect,\u201d said Angela Brundidge, 29, who came in from Alexandria with a friend from out of town. \u201cAnd it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nRaymond Metzger, a 33-year-old physical therapist and alum, and his girlfriend, marketer Teaira Brewer, said the appearance of the megastar who has seemed in the last couple years to have strayed seriously far from the black American heart, meant a lot.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople were cautious, but he\u2019s just trying to redeem himself with the culture,\u201d Metzger said.\n\nBrewer said people haven\u2019t forgotten \u201cabout MAGA,\u201d using the Trump slogan that West has worn repeatedly on his hat, and praised. \u201cBut this is a healing. He\u2019s trying to let people know he\u2019s still here,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cHe\u2019s like: \u2018Okay, I hear you.\u2019 He\u2019s going through something. But he\u2019s trying to say: \u2018I haven\u2019t forsaken you.'\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOthers on campus \u2014 and off \u2014 were less forgiving.\n\nKanye and Ta-Nehisi are at Howard on the same grounds right now. Finna be a clash of civilizations tgis morning \u2014 Brentin \u201c900 Number\u201d Mock (@brentinmock) October 12, 2019\n\nBriana Younger, a music editor at the New Yorker who graduated from Howard in 2012, said West\u2019s appearance at the historically significant campus was \u201creally gross.\u201d She noted that his Sunday Service last week in Salt Lake City featured him crediting the Republican Party of Lincoln with freeing slaves and referring to \u201cmental slavery.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAligning with Trump in my view is anti-black, full stop. But to go further here at Howard where so much was done for the liberation of black people, it\u2019s really gross,\u201d she said.\n\nYounger said she wasn\u2019t questioning West\u2019s faith but feels suspicious he is using religion \u2014 something deeply rooted in black life and culture and history \u2014 \u201cto get back into our good graces. Or if he\u2019s not worried about good graces, at least to put himself back into the mainstream of black consciousness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA profile earlier this year of West\u2019s new spiritual services by the music site OkayPlayer said the events were natural for the artist who has frequently rapped about his faith. The site called the services \u201can aesthetic celebration of Black Christian music in its myriad forms.\u201d\n\nIt also said the services were an attempt by West to \u201credeem\u201d himself from the anger triggered by his praise of Trump, and a recent comment that slavery \u201csounded like a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo return to religion is to imply a want for forgiveness, and the cultish air of the services promotes that without reproach,\u201d the piece read. \u201cIf anything, the services are a case-study in damage control.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "West's show at the prominent black college comes after a few rocky years for the Trump-supporting artist.", "authors": ["Michelle Boorstein", "Religion Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nL-uWJi4z1QRA9tQjJ7AFd7Q1C0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B6UA5VHIV4I6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
