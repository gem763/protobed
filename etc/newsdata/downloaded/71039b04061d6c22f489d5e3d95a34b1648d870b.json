She told the impeachment inquiry her boss had been so alarmed by efforts by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others to run a rogue foreign policy in Ukraine, designed to dig up dirt against Biden, that Bolton had instructed Hill to alert White House lawyers.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal\u201d was being cooked up, Bolton is reported to have said. According to Hill, he also attacked Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d.\n\nBy swinging the focus on to Bolton, Schiff indicated that Democratic leaders have no intention of allowing the patriotic glow around the killing of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to knock them off course in their pursuit of Trump.\n\nSchiff implied that any attempt to block Bolton\u2019s appearance before closed-door impeaching hearings would merely delay the start of open public proceedings in the impeachment process \u2013 a key demand of the White House and Republicans.\n\nBolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles Kupperman, filed a lawsuit on Friday asking a judge to determine if he should comply with a subpoena to testify before the House committees as scheduled on Monday. The move was widely seen as a delaying manoeuvre.\n\nIf Trump had been hoping that the successful mission to take out Baghdadi would deflect public attention from the gathering impeachment storm and on to a rare foreign policy victory, he would not have been satisfied for long. Even amid a rash of positive comment about the raid on the Sunday political shows, discussion soon reverted to Trump\u2019s troubles.\n\nVice-President Mike Pence was confronted with a question about impeachment from Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. He sought to present the image of Trump as commander-in-chief of US forces pulling off a dangerous mission in Syria as a counterpoint to his beleaguered domestic position.\n\nWhat the American people have seen in the last 12 hours \u2026 is that President Trump has never stopped fighting Mike Pence\n\n\u201cDemocrats have been pursuing impeachment by and large for the past three years,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWhat the American people have seen in the last 12 hours \u2026 is that President Trump has never stopped fighting to keep the promises we made in the election in 2016.\u201d\n\nPence went on to insist that \u201cthere was no quid pro quo \u2013 the president did nothing wrong\u201d. In fact, devastating evidence has emerged through the impeachment hearings that Trump used the leverage of a Washington summit meeting and almost $400m of military aide to Ukraine to force Kyiv into investigating Biden and other political opponents.\n\nAmong the damning evidence is a statement from Trump\u2019s own current chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who earlier this month confirmed that there had been quid pro quo with military aid withheld. Hours later he tried to retract the statement.\n\nEric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, told Fox News Sunday the Isis raid would have no impact on the impeachment proceedings.", "description": "* House intelligence chair: \u2018My guess is they\u2019re going to fight us\u2019  * Killing of al-Baghdadi gives Trump lifeline amid political battleJohn Bolton is seen in a video camera screen as he delivers remarks at a Washington think tank.
