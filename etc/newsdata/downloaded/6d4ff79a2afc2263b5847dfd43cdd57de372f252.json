He told the doctors, \u201cI\u2019m not moving, I\u2019m just sitting still\u201d. Not to get anyone sent off, he was just using his nous.\u2019\n\nPeter McCabe, chief executive of brain injury charity Headway, said: \u2018Giggs\u2019s claim that the player was being streetwise by staying down and appearing to have been knocked out is shocking.\n\n\u2018If James was acting, it raises serious questions about the player\u2019s understanding of the seriousness of concussion. Not only has he put his medical team under intense and unfair scrutiny, he\u2019s set a dangerous example for the millions watching at home.\n\n\u2018Similarly, we have serious concerns about terms like streetwise.
