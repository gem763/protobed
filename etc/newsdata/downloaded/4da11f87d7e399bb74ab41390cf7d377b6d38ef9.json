But the Khashoggi murder uncovered a dark layer of brutality that had been hidden behind what looked like a new era.\n\nJamal Khashoggi\u2019s murder was extensively covered by American media. He was a well-known journalist who wrote columns for The Washington Post and had deep connections in the US foreign policy establishment, especially in the Washington area where he resided more than a year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Opinion makers such as Thomas Friedman and others who had helped present the Crown Prince as a reformer to the American public suddenly became critical of him.\n\nThe Saudi government, it seemed, had crossed a red line by going after a high-profile dissident familiar by name and face to the Washington elite.\n\nFor all of his foreign and domestic policy mistakes over the past three years \u2013 the death of thousands of civilians in the Saudi-led war on Yemen, the arrests of hundreds of human rights activists and political opponents, and the blockade against Qatar \u2013 Mr Bazzi believes Mohammad bin Salman could end up paying a higher price for the murder of one Saudi journalist.\n\nIt quickly became clear that the massive media coverage was affecting public opinion of the Saudi Kingdom here in the US.\n\n\u201cAmericans now have a greater sense of the Saudi regime itself as a malign force\u201d, a former Congressional aide tells The Independent.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It\u2019s been \u201cthe most significant change in bilateral relations in decades,\u201d says the former Congressional aide.\n\nAmong lawmakers from both parties, Khashoggi\u2019s murder turned private discomfort with Saudi Arabia into open outrage at the Kingdom\u2019s actions.\n\nMembers of congress who had been reading the classified intelligence on Saudi Arabia\u2019s activities for decades suddenly had an immense amount of political space to voice concern at the entanglement with such a partner, adds the former congressional aide.\n\nColonel Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell says the near unanimous agreement of the US intelligence community that the murder was ordered at the highest level, \u201cpulled even diehard Saudi friends such as Lindsey Graham into the group wanting answers and action.\u201d\n\nBut we will understand the seriousness of congress as it moves on policy provisions in the near future, says Colonel Wilkerson.\n\nIn July, congress voted to ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia with support from Democratic and Republican lawmakers who have criticized the death of thousands of civilians in Yemen and the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nBut the Trump administration decided to stand behind the Kingdom and its Crown Prince. The president vetoed the measures saying the resolutions will weaken America\u2019s global competitiveness and damage important relationships with allies and partners.\n\nTrump also vetoed another measure back in April that would end US military involvement in the war in Yemen.\n\nIt was notable that Republican members of congress broke ranks and voted with Democrats in unprecedented move against Saudi Arabia.\n\nPresident Trump, his son in law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, and former Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, all contradicted the conclusions of US intelligence services that Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder.\n\nMost prior US administrations would have taken a tougher stance on the issue, says Stephen McInerney, Executive Director at Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately President Trump and the White House and his son in law Jared Kushner have an unusually close relationship with Mohammad Bin Salman\u201d and as a result they have gone out of their way to protect the crown prince and insulate him from this crime, McInerney tells The Independent.\n\nCongressman Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia who represents the Washington suburb that Jamal Khashoggi resided in, says the Trump administration has not done anything appreciably significant at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s winked and blinked and been an enabler in the murder of an American resident and abandoned American values,\u201d he says.\n\nThe crown price cannot be immune from this scrutiny and the Saudi government needs to decide that Mohammad bin Salman is such a liability that they need to have a change of course, says Congressman Connelly.\n\nEven if Saudi royals don\u2019t isolate the crown prince, there is little he can do to repair his damaged ties with the United States, many observers believe.\n\nMohammed bin Salman may try another charm offensive and convince occasional CEOs or right-wing pundits to share a photo with him, but it is very unlikely that he could wholly rehabilitate his image, and his failures continue to threaten the foundation of the long-time alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia.", "description": "It has now been a year since\u00a0Jamal Khashoggi\u00a0was brutally murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, a murder that tarnished the carefully-built \u201creformer\u201d image of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman in Washington, transformed US-Saudi relations in an unprecedented way, and sparked heated debates in Congress to cut weapons sales to the Kingdom and end the catastrophic war in", "authors": ["Negar Mortazavi"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/01/12/facebook-mbs.jpg"}
