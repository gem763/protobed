Read more: https://zd.net/2QbuNNR\n\nIf you use an iPhone for work, then you'll want to be as productive as possible to allow you to get the most done in the minimum amount of time (and get to your home life or hobbies!). Here are a handful of tips to help make you more productive in iOS 13.\n\nMust read: iOS 13: Security and privacy settings you need to tweak and check\n\n#1: How to activate Dark Mode\n\nIt feels like people have been wanting iOS to have a Dark Mode for, well, forever. Well, now you get it\u2026 if you can find it!\n\nThere are two ways:\n\nGo to Settings > Display & Brightness and choose Dark from Appearance.\n\nOpen up Control Center and tap and hold Brightness until it pops up to fill the screen. From there, tap Appearance to switch between Light to Dark modes.\n\n#2: Cool new volume slider\n\nHave you noticed the new, smaller, more discreet volume slider in iOS 13? No? Well do give the volume buttons a press.\n\nOK, cool, right? But there's more. Once the slider is visible, you can interact with it using your finger instead of continuing to press the buttons.\n\n#3: How to rearrange and delete apps\n\nThe way to rearrange and delete apps has changed in iOS 13. Now you press and hold down on an icon until Rearrange Apps appears and press on that. This will set all your apps wiggling, ready to be moved or deleted.\n\n#4: Undo\n\nRemember how undo in iOS was a shake of the handset? No, you probably don't, because people just didn't use this. Now Apple has added a new gesture -- a swipe left with three fingers. And if you want to redo an action, it's a three-finger swipe to the right.\n\n#5: New formatting bar\n\nApple has added a new text formatting bar in iOS for apps that support it. You activate it by pressing down on the keyboard with three fingers.\n\n#6: Easy Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access\n\nNow you can access Wi-Fi and Bluetooth settings without getting hip-deep in the Settings app. How? Bring up the Control Center pane and press and hold the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth buttons to switch between available networks and devices.\n\n#7: Kill unknown callers\n\nWell, not literally. Just prevent them from killing your time by sending them to voicemail directly. To enable this feature, go to Settings > Phone > and toggle to Silence Unknown Callers.\n\n#8: Optimize battery charging\n\nThis is a really useful feature that is designed to slow down the speed with which batteries age (we'll have to wait and see if it lives up to this expectation). This feature is called Optimised Battery Charging and lives in Settings > Battery > Battery Health.\n\n#9: Zip and unzip files\n\nYes, now you can zip and unzip files using the updated Files app. To zip a file (or files, or a folder), press down and hold and from the popup menu choose Compress. To unzip, press and hold down on a zip file and choose Uncompress.\n\n#10: Screenshot entire web pages\n\nThis is a super feature for Safari users. When you take a screenshot (press Volume Up + Power on devices with Face ID, and Power + Home Button on devices that have Touch ID), tap on the preview box to be offered the chance to save the Screen or Full Page.\n\nSee also:", "description": "A lot has changed in iOS 13.
