The company announced Tuesday it will start delivering grocery products within a two-hour window to all Prime members. While faster delivery increases Amazon's costs, investors have cheered the move, pushing the stock up more than 18% this year.\n\nTo avoid losing market share and relevance, other retailers might be forced to catch up on one-day shipping in the near future, which would put pressure on their earnings and margins, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\"The end results for retailers may be 1) top-line headwinds and 2) more investments and margin pressure, making us incrementally more cautious on our coverage as a whole,\" Gutman said.\n\nSo far the \"Big 6\" retailers \u2014 Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Lowe's, Costco and Target \u2014 remain healthy in terms of their share gains, but they should continue to \"moderate,\" the analyst said. He expects their new retail sales to decline 21% by 2020.\n\n\"Share losses are likely to be unevenly distributed among retailers,\" Gutman said. \"We think smaller retailers are more liable to cede share to AMZN's one day delivery initiative than the 'big 6.'\"", "description": "E-commence giant Amazon's one-day shipping is poised to pose a big threat to retailers, according to Morgan Stanley.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103789022-GettyImages-499278390.jpg?v=1532564073", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
