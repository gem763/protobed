The news spurred protests and demands for reinstatement.\n\n\u201cShort story....I get called a bit@# @ss Ni\u20ac\u20acA by a student, I responded do \u2018not call me ni\u20ac\u20aca !\u2019 And I got fired,\u201d Marlon Anderson wrote in a Facebook post on 16 October. Anderson also criticized the Madison Metropolitan School District, writing \u201cMMSD I unfortunately expected better.\u201d\n\nThe district said Anderson was fired due to its \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy against the use of racial slurs, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThe local teacher\u2019s union said it would file a grievance on behalf of Anderson, NBC 15 reported. Anderson reportedly said he would file suit if MMSD did not give him his job back.\n\nOn Friday, hundreds of students left school to protest, walking two miles to the MMSD offices. The school\u2019s black student union, of which Anderson\u2019s son is a member, met the MMSD superintendent and the school board president, the Journal Sentinel reported.\n\n\u201cAnything that involves us, our voices will be heard,\u201d Noah Anderson reportedly told a crowd of around 1,000 following the meeting.\n\nNational figures came to Anderson\u2019s defense. Arne Duncan, Barack Obama\u2019s education secretary, tweeted Friday\": \u201cThe Madison, WI school district needs to grow a brain, and a heart, really quickly! I\u2019ve seen some crazy things over the years, but this is one of the worst. Just more evidence our country still can\u2019t handle issues of race, and racism.\u201d\n\nThe singer Cher also offered to help, telling Anderson \u201cif you want to sue \u2026 I will incur your expenses\u201d.\n\nAnderson, 48, claims he was escorting an unruly male student out of Madison West High School on 9 October when the student started calling him the n-word. The student also allegedly shoved and threatened the school\u2019s assistant principal, the Journal Sentinel said.\n\nMadison West High School senior Noah Anderson, 17, president of the school\u2019s Black Student Union and son of the school\u2019s recently-fired security guard Marlin Anderson, leads a rally in support of his father outside the school in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday.

I\u2019m not your n-word. Do not call me that.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s principal, Karen Boran, told Anderson later that week keeping his job would be \u201can uphill battle\u201d. Boran then told parents in a letter on Wednesday a school staffer wasn\u2019t coming back to work, following an investigation.\n\n\u201cAs you know, our expectation when it comes to racial slurs has been very clear,\u201d Boran wrote. \u201cRegardless of context or circumstance, racial slurs are not acceptable in our schools.\u201d\n\nThe school district superintendent said on Friday it wants to have a strict policy against racial slurs, but suggested it might be reviewed.\n\n\u201cAll of us here know that education is a dynamic social process,\u201d the Journal Sentinel reported the statement as saying. \u201cSometimes it gets messy when we have to grapple together around deeply held values like what it means to be anti-racist.\n\n\u201c\u2026There is no doubt that language matters and racial slurs are harmful. However, at this point, we have an opportunity to look more deeply into the response to the use of racial slurs in our schools.\u201d\n\nThe school board president also said it would review district rules on disciplining staff for using such language.\n\nAn area youth organization, the Boys & Girls Club of Dane County, said on Friday that it had hired Anderson while district officials weigh his appeal.\n\nOn Facebook, Anderson wrote: \u201cThis is a great help to be able to earn wages while we go through this appeals process. The reality is I did not just lose wages but also benefits. Most importantly we will soon be without health insurance \u2026 which makes the loss that much more impactful to myself and my family.\n\n\u201cThis among other reasons is why I am still fighting for my position @ West with fervor.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was \u201camazed at the dynamic support from my Madison Community your love is recognized and so appreciated. I am still fighting for my position @ West and for justice to be applied to my situation. I am also still fighting to challenge the \u2018no tolerance\u2019 policy that made me a casualty to its flawed planning and implementation. Please continue to keep us in your prayers.\u201d", "description": "Students rally round Marlon Anderson as Madison Metropolitan School District indicates it will review zero-tolerance policyMarlon Anderson, a security guard at a Wisconsin high school who was fired after he says he repeated a racial slur while telling a student who had called him that word not to use", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis In New York"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_IBZb.frzf3nMegnq_Pxhg--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/c2cb1126a6ee1967575670cf5b30b3b5", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
