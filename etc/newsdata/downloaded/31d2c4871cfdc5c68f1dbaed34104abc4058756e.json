(Chris Szagola/Associated Press)\n\nJosh Jackson had just two seconds before a few Temple defenders surged into the backfield and brought him to the ground. On the next play, a quarterback draw, Jackson gained no yardage before he hit the turf again. Soon after, when Maryland opted to go for it on fourth down during this opening drive, Jackson misread the coverage and threw an interception.\n\nThose first moments in Maryland\u2019s Sept. 14 loss against Temple revealed a sobering proposition: Jackson wasn\u2019t himself that day in Philadelphia. Neither was the rest of the Terrapins\u2019 offense, which had started the season with such promise.\n\nJackson didn\u2019t throw another pick in the game, a 20-17 loss, but more passes bounced into the turf than landed in his receivers\u2019 hands. His play wasn\u2019t glaringly poor, just persistently off. The drop-off wouldn\u2019t have seemed so stark had Jackson not begun the year with two solid, reliable performances in which he totaled 541 passing yards with seven touchdowns and one interception.\n\nBut that\u2019s also what provides reassurance heading into the Friday night matchup against No. 12 Penn State: Both Jackson and Coach Michael Locksley believe the off day against Temple was nothing more than that.\n\n\u201cI definitely like to chalk that up as an outlier,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt was not a very good game on my side. Probably one of my worst games in college. So, yeah, we\u2019ll leave that as an outlier, and hopefully it stays like that.\u201d\n\n[Maryland\u2019s bowl path is tougher after Temple loss but maybe not as tough as once thought]\n\nJackson played in 16 games at Virginia Tech, throwing for more than 3,500 yards before an injury cut short his redshirt sophomore season. He arrived at Maryland not as one of the most high-profile quarterback transfers of the offseason but as someone who had the potential to stabilize a position where the Terps have struggled.\n\nJackson had never completed fewer than 40 percent of his passes in a college game and only twice had finished a game completing less than half. The 15-for-38 mark against Temple stands as his worst. But by Monday, just four days before the start of the Big Ten slate, Jackson seemed unfazed.\n\nHe has watched the film one-on-one with offensive coordinator Scottie Montgomery and met with Locksley a couple of times, too. Temple\u2019s defense didn\u2019t present more difficult looks compared to previous opponents, Locksley said. Jackson\u2019s decision-making, which is critical given Maryland\u2019s use of run-pass-option plays, simply wasn\u2019t operating at the level it had.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do with Josh is to go back and find out what created the issues he had,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cI take it back to having the right kind of eye discipline as a quarterback in the RPO game. \u2026 He\u2019s a guy that really has made really good choices and been really disciplined.\u201d\n\nOn Maryland\u2019s second drive of the Temple game, with the Terps trailing, defenders managed to deflect both of Jackson\u2019s first two passes. His third attempt of the drive resulted in his first completion of the day, but Darryl Jones\u2019s catch was short of the first down and Maryland had to punt.\n\nJackson eventually worked out of the slump. During a drive in the third quarter, Jackson completed three straight passes \u2014 17 yards to Dontay Demus, 22 yards to Brian Cobbs and then a 17-yard touchdown to Tyler Mabry. That gave the Terps their last lead of the game at 15-13.\n\nLooking toward the Penn State matchup, the first night game of the season before a sellout crowd, Jackson isn\u2019t concerned with finding that individual rhythm early \u2014 as long as the offense as a whole is functioning well.\n\n\u201cIf we're just running the ball and [the running backs] are all in a rhythm, I don't think it matters too much for me if they're just taking care of it,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cFor me, it's just being comfortable out there. I'm pretty laid-back, and highs and lows don't really affect me too much.\u201d\n\nDespite all that went wrong against Temple, this is what Locksley has reminded Jackson: Maryland still had a chance to win. The Terrapins had more than enough opportunities just yards from the goal line late in the game.\n\nFacing a first and goal from the 4-yard line, the Maryland staff unsuccessfully sent standout running back Anthony McFarland up the middle four times. Then in the game\u2019s waning moments, when Temple\u2019s shanked punt gifted Maryland another drive with favorable field position, Jackson overthrew tight end Chigoziem Okonkwo in the end zone. On the team\u2019s final try, Jackson led DJ Turner a bit too far, and the wide receiver caught what could have been the winning score out of bounds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to hit the panic button or change who he is or I don\u2019t need to change who I am as a coach,\u201d Locksley said. \u201cMy expectation, based on how he\u2019s practiced thus far, is that he\u2019ll be able to go out and execute the offense in the manner that he\u2019s done the first couple of opportunities we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nJohn Feinstein: App State, still the biggest little college football program going\n\nA referee was shot by a cannon during a college football game\n\nTerps running back Jake Funk out for the season with torn ACL\n\nMaryland has an entire bye week to stew over its offensive line issues", "description": "The Maryland quarterback called his performance against Temple \"probably one of my worst games in college,\" but he isn't concerned.", "authors": ["Emily Giambalvo", "Reporter Covering University Of Maryland Athletics", "September At Pm", "Emily Giambalvo Covers University Of Maryland Athletics For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hretw8jRpBpP6rRODJ4a4oArxBI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5ATD3PG3BAI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
