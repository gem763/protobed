You can find it in POLITICO's weekly print edition and online on Fridays.\n\nRANDOM JOB TITLE GENERATOR\n\nWelcome to the new European Commission or, as it will now be called, the European Thought Shower for Taking Action Going Forward. Yes, Ursula von der Leyen put portfolios to faces on Tuesday and came up with job titles that confused and amused in equal measure (and yes, I realize the irony of someone whose business card says \"Slot News Editor\" complaining about bizarre job titles).\n\nThere's Latvia's former PM Valdis Dombrovskis, who becomes \"executive vice-president for an economy that works for people\" (good to see people get long overdue recognition), and Slovakia's Maro\u0161 \u2014 everyone's a (dia)critic \u2014 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, who becomes \"vice-president for interinstitutional relations and foresight.\" First question for \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d: Did you see this coming?\n\nBest, and most controversial, is the job given to Margaritis Schinas, the Greek nominee and former Commission chief spokesman.He's the (at the time of writing) \"vice-president for protecting our European way of life.\" So that's not doing any work in August and drinking in the street? Smoking too much? Driving through a city center honking your car horn after a football win? Or perhaps it's just another way of saying \"let's keep Europe white and Christian\"?\n\nJanez Lenar\u010di\u010d of Slovenia will be commissioner for crisis management. Is that Brexit? Oh, and Italy's Paolo Gentiloni gets the economy portfolio. Giving an Italian that job is like putting Boris Johnson in charge of fidelity.\n\nCHICKEN POX\n\nWinner of the coveted \"political meat of the week\" was undoubtedly chicken \u2014 on both sides of the Atlantic. Boris Johnson dubbed Labour's Jeremy Corbyn a \"chlorinated chicken\" on several occasions, including to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who looked confused (although that is the Pence default setting).\n\nThe Conservative Party social media team then tweeted out a doctored picture of Corbyn in a chicken suit next to the logo \"JFC\" (but his middle name's Bernard, so JBC would have been more accurate). Tories clearly have short memories. Last year, hundreds of KFC stores were forced to close because they ran out of, er, chicken, and people called the emergency services. And we're supposed to cope with Brexit!\n\nMeanwhile, the Donald Trump administration said it wanted to take \"influential\" British journalists to American farms so they can try this delicious \"chlorinated chicken\" for themselves. Pro tip: Journalists also like beer (and cake).\n\nDOS AND DON'TS\n\nDO: Know your history.\n\nThe U.K. faces a \"Herculean task\" negotiating free-trade agreements with the EU and the U.S. simultaneously, Irish PM Leo Varadkar said, but pledged that Ireland would be its \"ally, your Athena\" in doing so if Brexit went smoothly. As history buff Boris Johnson will have known full well, Athena helped Hercules in his madness by knocking him out to prevent him from killing any more people.\n\nDON'T: Feel sorry for John Bolton.\n\nYes, he's out as Donald Trump's national security adviser but a close look at Bolton's resignation letter reveals he's the kind of man who puts a double space after the full stop (or period, if you will) and as such is an appalling human being.\n\nCAPTION COMPETITION\n\nCan you do better? Email pdallison@politico.eu or on Twitter @pdallison74\n\nLast week we gave you this photo.\n\nThanks for all the entries. There were loads (no, really). Here's the top 3 (there's no prize except for the gift of laughter, which I think we can all agree is far more valuable than cash or booze).\n\n\"Tell your mothers I still love them\" by Mark Hayden\n\n\"Sit down you girly swot\" by Peter Neilson\n\n\"Grow up, Boris\" by Peter den Ouden\n\nPaul Dallison is POLITICO's Slot News Editor", "description": "The new Commission has a serious naming problem.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167508698-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
