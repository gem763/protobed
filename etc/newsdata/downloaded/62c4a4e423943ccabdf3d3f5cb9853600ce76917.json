Margaret Chase Smith (R-Maine) took on Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy, a member of her own party, in a speech she called a \u201cDeclaration of Conscience.\u201d While Chase didn\u2019t mention McCarthy by name, she urged her fellow Republicans to stand up for the basic American values being trampled by McCarthyism:\n\n\u201cIt is high time that we stop thinking politically as Republicans and Democrats about elections and started thinking patriotically as Americans about national security based on individual freedom. I don\u2019t want to see the Republican party ride to political victory on the four horsemen of calumny: fear, ignorance, bigotry, smear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, did she resonate,\u201d Cuomo said before noting that Chase\u2019s words served as a reminder to her fellow politicians.\n\n\u201cShe reminded them your duty was to the people,\u201d he added. \u201cNot to party alone.\u201d\n\nThen, Cuomo called on today\u2019s lawmakers to follow her example.\n\n\u201cPlease give the people a reason to believe again, Mr. and Mrs. Office Holder,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are not man or woman enough to say it out loud like Margaret Chase Smith, then listen to her words and let it guide your actions.\u201d\n\nSee his full segment below:\n\nCNN's @ChrisCuomo cites Sen. Margaret Chase Smith's 1950 speech, \"Declaration of Conscience,\" for how to deal with the \"tactics of division.\"\n\n\n\n\"She reminded them, your duty was to the people, not to party alone,\" Cuomo said. #ClosingArgument pic.twitter.com/rWOkYSVf0y \u2014 Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) October 9, 2019\n\nLove HuffPost?
