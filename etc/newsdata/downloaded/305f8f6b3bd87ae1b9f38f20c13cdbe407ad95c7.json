I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\nWhite House correspondent John Roberts was also shocked, saying, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to compile my thoughts too. I walked out here to do the hit and suddenly got hit by a subway train. Holy mackerel.\u201d\n\nSmith was the least popular anchor among Fox News viewers as of a November 2018 poll and a target of Trump. On Wednesday evening, Attorney General William Barr met with Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch in the wake of Trump\u2019s criticism of the network over its polling.\n\n\u201cFrom the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll,\u201d Trump tweeted on Thursday. \u201cWhoever their Pollster is, they suck.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Fox News] is also much different than it used to be in the good old days,\u201d he continued. \u201cWith people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme Court Justice & I turned him down (he\u2019s been terrible ever since), Shep Smith, @donnabrazile (who gave Crooked Hillary the debate questions & got fired from @CNN), & others, @FoxNews doesn\u2019t deliver for US anymore. It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nFor months, polls taken by the network have shown the president trailing his Democratic rivals in hypothetical matchups for the 2020 presidential race, and this week a survey it conducted showed a majority of Americans favored the impeachment inquiry launched against the president by House Democrats.\n\nShepard Smith (Photo: Steven Ferdman/Getty Images) More\n\nSmith had often questioned the administration\u2019s moves. Last week, for instance, he pointed out that Trump had potentially violated federal election law by calling on China and Ukraine to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nAt the network, Smith was also targeted by some of his pro-Trump colleagues who serve as informal advisers to the president. Sean Hannity labeled him \u201canti-Trump\u201d in 2017. In September, Tucker Carlson openly mocked Smith on his primetime show. Fox executives sided with Carlson in the spat.\n\nLast month, Smith repeatedly blasted Trump on the air for spreading fake news after the president spent the week defending his false claim that Alabama was in the path of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThat prompted Trump to summon Roberts into the Oval Office to complain about the network\u2019s coverage of the controversy \u2014 and reportedly Smith in particular.\n\n\u201cHe stressed to me that forecasts for Dorian last week had Alabama in the warning cone,\u201d Roberts wrote in a subsequent email to Fox staffers. \u201cHe insisted that it is unfair to say Alabama was never threatened by the storm.\u201d\n\nSmith began work at Fox News in 1996 as a host and correspondent, eventually transitioning to his daytime show, \u201cShepard Smith Reporting,\u201d in 2002.\n\n\u201cEven in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive,\u201d said Smith in his final words of the broadcast.\n\nAsked at the White House Friday evening whether he or his attorney general had asked Murdoch to fire Smith, Trump said he had not heard the news of the anchor\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s a shame. Is he leaving because of bad ratings?\u201d Trump asked before adding, \u201cI wish him well.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Fox News anchor Shepard Smith, both a critic of President Trump and a target of his scorn, announced Friday that he was leaving the network.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x5orZzIGXyvBH2HP6AXoxw--~B/aD0yMzk2O3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/e5ca8e60-ec65-11e9-beec-6a83a1aa98dc", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
