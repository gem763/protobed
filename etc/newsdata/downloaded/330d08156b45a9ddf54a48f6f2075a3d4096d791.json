We were certainly in our fair share of them tonight.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth teams squandered opportunities to prevail in earlier overtime periods: Virginia Tech kicker Brian Johnson missed \u00adgame-winning attempts from 41 and 42 yards, and North Carolina\u2019s Noah Ruggles missed from 35 yards and had a 44-yard attempt blocked.\n\nThe game marked the debut of college football\u2019s new overtime rules, which give each team a two-point try after the fourth overtime.\n\nPatterson played the majority of the second half for the Hokies after starting quarterback Hendon Hooker went down with an injury late in the first half and Fuente elected to replace backup Ryan Willis with Patterson after three series.\n\nPatterson rushed for 122 yards on 21 carries and also threw for 54 yards and a TD.\n\n\u201cAfter Hendon got the job, and he played a great game against Miami, it\u2019s really easy to get down on yourself and think your shot is never going to come,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut I just had to stay in that zone of preparing like I was the starter, and today was that day that I got to play quarterback, so that was pretty cool.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Associated Press\n\nAD", "description": "Third-team QB Quincy Patterson leads the Hokies to a 43-41, six-overtime victory.", "authors": ["Jimmy Robertson"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/kEj_3e52cSitphhTUA-2IpbQT-4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KYYF6ZHS6AI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
