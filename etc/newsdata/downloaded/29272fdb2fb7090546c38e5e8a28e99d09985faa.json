Walter White didn\u2019t die. Let\u2019s just say that, and then we\u2019ll see if we can get two or three more years out of it,\u201d that\u2019s when I would have to say, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should\u201d.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe added: \u2018What he wrote for the conclusion of the series is, to me, perfect. So I think that would be a problem if he wanted to.

You didn\u2019t have to wait your whole life to do something special.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019re not crying, you are.\n\nWhen speaking about being asked to return to his role as Walter for the movie, Cranston said \u2018wonderful\u2019.\n\nHe explained: \u2018I was really grateful that he thought of me to be a part of this. At the same time, I was wondering, \u201cHow the hell is that going to work?\u201d\n\n\u2018I guessed it only could be retrospective, in flashback, and said, \u201cOK, whatever he has to do\u201d.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
