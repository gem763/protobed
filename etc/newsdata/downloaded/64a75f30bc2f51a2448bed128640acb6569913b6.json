But he said at the time that price changes in China remained moderate.\n\nSurging food prices and higher consumer inflation will not be a barrier to policy easing, analysts said.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8% from a year earlier, unchanged from July and beating analysts' expectations at 2.6%, but still below China's annual target of around 3%.\n\n\"Despite the higher CPI, we expect the People's Bank of China (PBOC) to cut interest rates in the fourth quarter this year,\" ANZ said.\n\n\"China's declining producer price index (PPI) carries more weight with policymakers in their monetary policy decisions, in our view.\"\n\nThe food price index rose 10% on-year, from a 9.1% jump in July and the highest since January 2012. Pork prices soared 46.7%, after an increase of 27% in July, as African swine fever decimates the country's herds.\n\nMost analysts expect pork prices to continue rising as supply plummets, spilling over into prices of other food items.\n\nCore consumer inflation, which excludes food and fuel, remained mild, however. It picked up to 1.5% on-year after a 1.3% gain in the prior month.\n\n\"We do not think elevated inflation will lead PBOC to raise rates, given still-mild core inflation, although it could put some limit on rates declining too much,\" Goldman Sachs said in a research note.\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFLATIONARY PRESSURE\n\nWeakness in producer prices has also been seen recently in other major economies including the United States, Canada and the euro zone, raising concerns over demand worldwide as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute upends global supply chains.\n\nChina's oil and gas extraction industries saw the greatest deflationary pressure in August, notching up price declines of 9.1% on year. The oil, coal and other fuel processing industries saw prices fall 5.9%.\n\nDemand for major building materials faltered in August and manufacturing activity contracted more steeply than expected, while the central government remained reluctant to ease curbs on the property sector, a major growth driver, as it tries to keep home price rises in check.\n\nSpot prices for steel reinforcing bars continued to hover below the level seen in the same period last year, worsened by a seasonal slackening in construction activities during summer.\n\nImports of unwrought copper, another cornerstone material in construction and a key gauge of demand, also sank in August.\n\nAnalysts expect more pain for Chinese exporters in upcoming months, with more U.S. tariff measures set to take effect on Oct. 1 and Dec. 15.\n\nBoth sides agreed on Thursday to hold high-level talks in early October, but analysts remain doubtful that a trade deal could be forged in the next few quarters.\n\nStory continues", "description": "China's factory-gate prices shrank at the sharpest pace in three years in August, falling deeper into deflationary territory and reinforcing the urgency for Beijing to step up economic stimulus as the trade war with the United States intensifies.
