The FTSE100 UKX, +0.73% index of leading stocks closed at 7,163, up 12.07 points. The pound GBPUSD, -0.4475% fell to $1.2962.\n\n\u201cSterling has been sold off from levels above 1.30 against the U.S. dollar as Johnson\u2019s plan to get Brexit done meets yet more obstacles,\u201d said Chris Towner, a director at independent financial risk adviser JCRA. \u201cThis frustration will weigh on sterling but only to the extent that we have to wait for the timing of the inevitable vote. Sterling still looks like a compressed spring waiting for good news to lurch to another level higher.\u201d\n\nBercow told parliament: \u201cIn summary, today\u2019s motion is in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s motion and the House [of Commons] has decided the matter. My ruling is therefore that the motion will not be debated today as it would be repetitive and disorderly to do so.\u201d\n\nThe speaker, who is supposed to be an impartial adjudicator, was immediately accused of bias by Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative Party lawmaker.\n\nThe controversial Bercow, who is being replaced at the end of the month, was accused recently of tarnishing the role of speaker with his bias by fellow Tory politician Shailesh Vara, who said he \u201cat times behaved like a playground bully,\u201d a charge Bercow denies.\n\nDespite the setback, Johnson said ministers were confident they had the numbers to push a deal through parliament.\n\nRupert Thompson, head of research at investment firm Henderson Rowe, said: \u201cWe have not made any major adjustment to our portfolios in light of the continuing uncertainties and retain a somewhat cautious stance on UK equities.\n\n\u201cA deal would very much just mark the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end. The lack of clarity over the UK\u2019s future trading relationships will surely remain a significant drag on UK growth for a long time yet, albeit less than before.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Johnson was forced to send a letter to the EU requesting a delay to Brexit, but he sent another one effectively saying he does not mean it.\n\nIn a note, the PM explained that the government was just complying with the law by sending the letter. He followed up with a photocopy of the text he was compelled to send under the law, known as the Benn Act. Crucially Johnson refused to sign the text. He then sent another letter spelling out that he did not actually want an extension.\n\n\u201cI have made clear since becoming Prime Minister and made clear to parliament again today [Saturday], my view, and the Government\u2019s position, (is) that a further extension would damage the interests of the U.K. and our EU partners, and the relationship between us,\u201d he wrote in that letter.\n\nThe developments promised more uncertainty in a yearslong battle over Britain\u2019s future and its ties with the EU. Opponents of Brexit fear, among other things, that departure from the trading block will hurt trade and the overall economy. Those favoring separation say Britain after Brexit will be more independent and not bound by the rules and regulations of the EU.\n\nInvestors in the U.S. have mostly shrugged off the developments in the U.K. as the U.S. trade war with China and its dampening effects on the economy have taken most of the attention.\n\nOn Saturday Johnson was forced to postpone a key vote in Parliament that was aimed at getting his Brexit agreement approved.\n\nPoliticians had gathered Saturday morning for a historic meeting in the House of Commons\u2014the first time they had assembled on a Saturday since Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. It marked only the fourth Saturday they have met in 80 years.\n\nJohnson\u2019s plans were frustrated after opponents delayed the legislation in a move to derail Brexit, and the prime minister sent lawmakers home without voting on the deal.\n\nOliver Letwin, a former Conservative minister, tabled an amendment to delay agreeing on any deal until all the legislation needed to implement it has been passed through Parliament.\n\nThat amendment was carried by 322 votes to 306, which meant the politicians would have withheld approval of the prime minister\u2019s deal until the legislation to enact it had been passed.\n\nThe motivation was to remove any possibility of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\nSaturday was a day of high drama as thousands of people marched through central London calling for another \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d to check that the U.K. is happy to leave the EU under the new withdrawal agreement.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, and his 12-year-old son Peter Theodore Alphege, had to be escorted home by police as pro-EU protesters hurled abuse at them shouting \u201cshame on you,\u201d \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cscumbag.\u201d", "description": "Britain\u2019s divorce from the EU was once again in disarray after the House of Commons speaker John Bercow refused to allow politicians to vote on Brexit on...", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner", "Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT722_Brexit_ZG_20191021135626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
