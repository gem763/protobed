He is a world-class striker, there's no question about that,\" said Rodgers after Vardy's latest strike against Burnley.\n\n\"His numbers are phenomenal. He is always ready, and playing against teams that sit deep he can still find a way to score a goal.\n\n\"To be consistently at the level he can be at, it takes a huge amount of concentration.\"\n\nIndeed, Rodgers has even taken his other attacking players to task leaving too much of the goalscoring burden on the 32-year-old.\n\n\"There's no doubt we can get better,\" added Rodgers. \"The mentality is getting better and that is the exciting thing I have with this group, there is so much more to come from them.\"\n\nRodgers may soon also have even more talent at his disposal.\n\nLeicester's bright start to the campaign has come despite not spending most of the \u00a380 million ($103 million) they received from Harry Maguire's move to Manchester United in August.\n\nAccording to reports on Thursday, the club are ramping up their plans to splash some of that cash in the January transfer window to take full advantage of the floundering fortunes of United, Arsenal and Tottenham to break the glass ceiling of the top four.", "description": "Revitalised by the appointment of manager Brendan Rodgers and free-scoring form of Jamie Vardy, Leicester City are once again upsetting the applecart of the Premier League's top six.
