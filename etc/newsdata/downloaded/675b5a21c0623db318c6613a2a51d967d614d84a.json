REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/Illustration\n\nThe investment manager is buying Argentina\u2019s dollar bonds in the belief the clear favorite to win next month\u2019s general election, Alberto Fernandez, will be less radical in overhauling the government\u2019s debt than markets now expect, one of its executives said on Wednesday.\n\nArgentina\u2019s bonds and currency plummeted to record lows last month as investors fled after left-leaning Peronist Fernandez heavily defeated President Mauricio Macri in a primary election, prompting the market-friendly incumbent to unveil plans to delay debt payments and impose currency controls.\n\nAshmore was one of several foreign fund managers holding Argentina debt heading into the market meltdown and had 10.5% of its $1.4 billion short-duration emerging-markets fund invested in Argentina at the end of June, Morningstar data show.\n\nIt still has exposure to both international and local bonds, said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore.\n\n\u201cYes, the fundamental outlook is worse as there\u2019s more uncertainty about what Fernandez will do when he becomes president, but the bonds are now pricing in an extreme version of what Fernandez may do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy view is that we will see a more moderate Peronist party emerge under Fernandez than what the market is currently pricing in, that\u2019s why there\u2019s value in the (international) bonds.\u201d\n\nAlberto Fernandez, seen as a pragmatic figure within the broad Peronist political flank, is running with ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a divisive figure who pushed interventionist policies during her two terms from 2007 to 2015.\n\nAshmore\u2019s buying activity contrasts with some other fund managers who have been seeking to pare back exposure.\n\n\u201cWe have been reducing risk all year in Argentina and have no active risk in local currency and zero underweight in sovereign dollar bonds,\u201d said Brett Diment, head of global emerging market debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments. \u201cWe think pretty big challenges remain in Argentina and some sort of a debt extension is inevitable. Whether we also get principal haircut or reduction coupons is probably too early to say.\u201d\n\nAshmore\u2019s Dehn thinks the Fernandez administration might take inspiration from the performance of the first two years of former President Nestor Kirchner\u2019s government in the early 2000s. Then, Argentina\u2019s economy grew 8.8% in real GDP growth per year and Kirchner stuck with the government\u2019s then IMF program, he said.\n\nAlberto Fernandez was chief of staff for Nestor Kirchner, the predecessor and late husband of Cristina Fernandez.\n\nArgentina is now waiting for a key $5 billion tranche of its latest IMF program.\n\nDehn is also buoyed by Fernandez\u2019s choice of Guillermo Nielsen as economic adviser, even though some creditors are wary after his role as the country\u2019s chief debt negotiator following a default in 2002.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Nielsen is part of the economic team and talking for Fernandez suggests to me that Fernandez will pursue a more market-friendly line than currently expected,\u201d he said.", "description": "British emerging markets investor Ashmore Group is betting that Argentina's current crisis, that has seen the country veer toward default, is not as bad as it looks.", "authors": ["Tom Arnold", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433911109&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O26B", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
