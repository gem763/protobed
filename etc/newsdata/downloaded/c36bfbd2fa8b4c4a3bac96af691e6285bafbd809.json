We will see these things anew in Syria and Afghanistan if we abandon our partners and retreat from these conflicts before they are won,\u201d McConnell wrote.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s wars will be \u2018endless\u2019 only if America refuses to win them,\u201d he added in an apparent jab at Trump\u2019s insistence that the withdrawal was necessary \u201cto get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars.\u201d\n\nThe offensive has killed more than 500 people, including dozens of civilians, while some 300,000 civilians have been displaced within Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor.\n\nTurkey agreed to suspend its offensive for five days in northern Syria while Kurdish fighters withdraw from the area, following high-stakes talks with Pence in Ankara.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell Friday attacked President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from Syria", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/34a810_senate-majority-leader-mitch-mcconnell-has-warned-us-withdrawal-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
