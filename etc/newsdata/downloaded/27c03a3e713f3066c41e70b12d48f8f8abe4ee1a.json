She paid for her own flight, and although the organisers of the trip, London & Partners, booked a hotel for her, she settled the bill.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson denied any wrongdoing, telling the BBC's John Pienaar: \"All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way.\"\n\nOn Friday, Mr Johnson said he would comply with an order from the London Assembly to explain his links to Ms Arcuri.\n\nHowever he added: \"But on this particular matter, I think they are barking up the wrong tree.\"\n\nSeparately, a junior minister, Matt Warman, has said the government has launched a \"review\" of the \u00a3100,000 award made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's training company Hacker House.\n\nBut he insisted it had been an \"open, transparent and competitive process\".", "description": "It is alleged Jennifer Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Boris Johnson.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13A75/production/_108910508_583c27f0-ced6-42ff-835e-1180b5093e95.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
