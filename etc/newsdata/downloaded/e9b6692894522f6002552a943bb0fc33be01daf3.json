But I think my position is clear.\u201d\n\nConway saved his most intense criticism for Cipollone, who signaled in a letter Tuesday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the three committee chairmen leading the impeachment probe that the White House would block any cooperation with their investigations.\n\n\u201cGiven that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the Executive Branch cannot be expected to participate in it,\u201d Cipollone wrote to the Democratic lawmakers.\n\nConway condemned that correspondence from the White House\u2019s top attorney as \u201cjust garbage,\u201d and dismissed calls from Cipollone and congressional Republicans for Pelosi to call a vote by the full House to formally authorize the establishment of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nConway asserted that the arguments laid out in Cipollone\u2019s letter amount to \u201ccomplete nonsense, because all the Constitution says is that the House has the sole power over impeachment\u201d \u2014 adding that the chamber\u2019s members could hypothetically approve an indictment of Trump without holding hearings at all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse to prevent evidence, damning evidence, from reaching the public,\u201d he said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/49/28/0a206af14b63a429c2b6d63c0c6c/190327-george-conway-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
