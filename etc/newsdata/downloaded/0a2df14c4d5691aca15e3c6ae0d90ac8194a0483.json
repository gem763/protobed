All the victims were adults, Rovella said.\n\nESCAPE HATCH\n\nSome people on the plane opened an escape hatch and helped others get out, he said.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of the next coming days, you\u2019re going to hear about some heroic efforts from some of the individuals that were in or around that plane,\u201d he said.\n\nThe airport, located in the town of Windsor Locks, was closed for about 3-1/2 hours after the crash.\n\nThe plane was operated by the Massachusetts-based Collings Foundation, which is dedicated to the preservation and public display of automotive and aviation-related history.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe Collings Foundation flight team is fully cooperating with officials to determine the cause of the crash of the B-17 Flying Fortress and will comment further when details become known,\u201d the foundation said in a statement.\n\nThe vintage plane was one of only 18 B-17 aircraft still operating in the United States.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real need for scrutiny and oversight if these planes are going to continue flying,\u201d U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told an earlier news conference.", "description": "A World War Two-era B-17 bomber trying to make an emergency landing at an airport near Hartford, Connecticut, crashed and burned on Wednesday, killing seven people on board and closing the airport for several hours, authorities said.", "authors": ["Peter Szekely", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436424053&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911FI"}
