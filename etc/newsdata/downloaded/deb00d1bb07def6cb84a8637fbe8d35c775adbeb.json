I\u2019m 67 minutes late. If you\u2019re not ten minutes early where I\u2019m from, my dad chews you out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe apology really isn\u2019t necessary. It\u2019s the evening of Tuesday, September 24, the night before the transcript of President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky is going to be released, and all hell is breaking loose in Washington. It\u2019s entirely understandable why the Nebraska senator, a member of the Intelligence Committee, is late. And why he might need a drink.\n\nJust a couple of weeks earlier, on September 10, President Trump endorsed the reelection of Sasse, who\u2019s up for a second term in 2020, in a tweet: \u201cSenator Ben Sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of Nebraska. He is great with our Vets, the Military, and your very important Second Amendment. Strong on Crime and the Border, Ben has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement all but guaranteed Sasse\u2019s reelection in ruby-red Nebraska, where the only possible threat to his candidacy would be a primary challenge backed by the Republican president. \u201cBen\u2019s grateful for the president\u2019s kind words,\u201d Sasse\u2019s spokesman James Wegmann said that night. \u201cThey don\u2019t always see eye to eye, but they\u2019ve built a relationship where they work together when they agree and they wrestle hard when they don\u2019t. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump tweet also provided an occasion for some pundits and politicians to accuse Sasse, once one of the sharpest Trump critics in the Republican party, of compromising in order to win the president\u2019s endorsement. \u201cSasse\u2019s campaign team placed him in the endorsement protection program a couple years ago,\u201d Michigan congressman Justin Amash, who left the GOP over his opposition to Trump, wrote on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSasse says he didn\u2019t ask for Trump\u2019s endorsement and didn\u2019t know it was coming, and he seems rankled by accusations that he has sold out. \u201cThe biggest news story in Nebraska for the ten days before he endorsed me was the fact I declined to serve on his reelection committee in Nebraska,\u201d he says. Serving on the reelection committee would\u2019ve required the senator to refrain from publicly disagreeing with the president, according to Sasse, and he wanted to maintain his ability to speak his mind.\n\nOver the past year, of course, Sasse has publicly spoken his mind about Trump a lot less. \u201cI\u2019ve said about everything you can say critical of the president. And to just say it again so Morning Joe can use it tomorrow, that seems pretty boring,\u201d says Sasse, who regularly meets with the president at the White House and speaks to him by phone. \u201cOur relationship is surprisingly, I think given public perceptions, I think surprisingly amiable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump-Ukraine scandal, however, threatens to undo the Trump\u2013Sasse rapprochement. When asked whether it\u2019s an abuse of power for an American president to ask a foreign government to investigate the family of the president\u2019s political rival, Sasse tells me he won\u2019t speculate about \u201cparticular hypotheticals.\u201d But \u201cin general terms,\u201d he says, \u201cAmerican elections should be for Americans. And the idea that we would have foreign nation-states coming into the American electoral process, or the information surrounding an election, is really, really bad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould it be an impeachable offense if the president withheld military aid in order to pressure a foreign ally to investigate the president\u2019s political rival? Sasse says it\u2019s not helpful to comment as \u201csomebody who might be a juror in a case.\u201d The senator\u2019s fairly mild remarks were enough to draw the ire of Fox News host Laura Ingraham. \u201cLike Romney, Sasse is not someone you want in a foxhole with you,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next night, after reading the whistleblower report, Sasse tells reporters that there are \u201cvery troubling\u201d things in it, and that \u201cRepublicans ought not just circle the wagons, and Democrats ought not be using words like \u2018impeach\u2019 before they knew anything about the actual substance.\u201d Sasse\u2019s comments were, again, fairly mild, but they were enough to place Sasse alongside Mitt Romney as one of only two Republican senators to express any serious concern about the scandal.\n\nWhat makes Sasse\u2019s commitment to gather all the facts and withhold judgment difficult is that he\u2019s seeking reelection in Trump\u2019s party. It\u2019s an unusual dynamic when the accused might be able to get a juror fired with an insulting tweet or two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd surely the president wouldn\u2019t have endorsed Sasse unless Sasse had promised to endorse the president in 2020?\n\nNo, Sasse tells me, he won\u2019t be endorsing Trump or any other candidate in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anyone in any race,\u201d he says.\n\nOur conversation moves on to other topics, including why Sasse, who often seems frustrated and bored with his job, even wants a second term (more on that in a minute). But as he gets up to leave at the end of our interview, I want to be sure I heard him correctly that he will not endorse any candidate in any race between now and November 2020. \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThe only asterisk I\u2019d put on that is the socialism point I\u2019m making,\u201d Sasse adds. He begins talking about how Omaha\u2019s Republican congressman, Don Bacon, is running against an \u201cactual socialist\u201d and he\u2019ll be helping Bacon\u2019s campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running against the Democrats\u2019 crazy turn toward socialism. But, as a matter of formal endorsements\u2014I mean, I\u2019m working to support the Republican ticket, period. But I\u2019m not endorsing candidates in individual races.\u201d\n\nWait, Sasse is supporting but not endorsing candidates?\n\nDoes supporting the Republican ticket mean supporting Trump in 2020? \u201cAll of the turn toward socialism is disastrous,\u201d Sasse replies.\n\nSo does Sasse support Trump-Pence in 2020?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting the Republican ticket.\u201d\n\nUp and down the ticket, including the presidential race?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supporting the Republican ticket,\u201d he replies. \u201cSee ya, dude.\u201d\n\nSasse\u2019s comments leave me confused, and I\u2019m pretty sure my bewilderment has nothing to do with consuming one can of watery light lager.\n\nIn 2016, Sasse cast his vote in the presidential race for Mike Pence, not Donald Trump. Did that count as \u201csupporting the Republican ticket\u201d?\n\nDuring a follow-up phone interview on September 30, I ask Sasse whether he has decided he will vote for Donald Trump (presuming Trump is renominated in 2020) or he might vote for Pence again, as he did in 2016. But Sasse still won\u2019t directly answer the question. \u201cI think that leaving it at supporting the Republican ticket is the right place for me to be,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI plan to do some work for the Republican ticket down the road. Focused on my race right now and really not talking about anybody else.\u201d\n\nEfforts to get Sasse to talk about why he didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016 and whether his assessment of the president has changed don\u2019t prove very successful, either. Sasse says he is \u201creally grateful for the fact that the president has completely kept his word\u201d about judicial nominees, and that Elizabeth Warren\u2019s socialism and majoritarian politics \u201cwould completely baffle the Founders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve said almost everything that I can say about Donald Trump,\u201d Sasse says.\n\nIt is not clear which Republican Sasse intends to vote for in the 2020 presidential election, or whether he\u2019s even made up his mind. What is clear is that it is not in Sasse\u2019s political interest to go to war with Trump in 2020 the way he did in 2016. Yet it\u2019s also clear that it is not in Trump\u2019s self-interest to go to war with Sasse.\n\nBoth Sasse and Trump are supported by about four out of five Nebraska Republicans. A February poll conducted by We Ask America found that Sasse has a 74 percent approval rating among Nebraska GOP primary voters, and Roll Call reported in August that Sasse\u2019s job approval had seen a 14-point uptick in separate Morning Consult surveys among Nebraska Republicans over the first six months of 2019.\n\nIn other words, Sasse isn\u2019t anywhere close to facing the same primary threat that former Arizona senator Jeff Flake faced during the last election. Flake was down by double digits against Kelli Ward at this point in a Republican primary two years ago and decided to retire rather than face likely defeat. If Trump backed Sasse\u2019s GOP challenger Matt Innis, it\u2019s not clear that Sasse would lose.\n\nMore important, going to war with Sasse could cost Trump a precious vote in the Electoral College. Nebraska divides some of its electoral votes by congressional district, and Trump won the Omaha congressional district by only two percentage points in 2016. Support for Republicans has declined in the suburbs during Trump\u2019s presidency, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine scenarios in which a single electoral vote would make the difference between a Trump victory and an Electoral College tie in 2020, or the difference between a tie and a Trump loss. The president, of course, is not known for always coolly following his interest instead of his emotions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does Sasse, who has publicly mused about leaving the Republican party and who is so plainly conflicted about the Republican president, even want to serve another term in the Senate?\n\nThat question has been raised by many of his critics, but especially by those who say the Nebraska senator is a show horse, not a legislative workhorse. New York magazine columnist Josh Barro wrote that Sasse \u201cran for office as a \u2018healthcare expert.\u2019 Then, where was he during the health law debate? Even setting Trump aside, he seems to have no interest in all the non-commencement-speech aspects of the job.\u201d During his first term, Sasse wrote two books, but he never put any sort of compre-hensive alternative to Obamacare into legislation.\n\nThe failure to repeal and replace Obamacare was a collective failure of the Republican party\u2014with leaders in Congress and the White House deserving an extra share of blame\u2014and there\u2019s no reason to think one Senate freshman could have changed the outcome. But Sasse, a former assistant secretary of health and human services, in the Bush administration, did indeed run for the Senate as a candidate uniquely qualified to go after Obamacare. National Review even put him on the cover, as \u201cObamacare\u2019s Nebraska Nemesis.\u201d In 2015, he introduced a bill to temporarily provide tax credits in the event the Supreme Court invalidated Obamacare, and earlier this year he introduced a bill expanding health-savings accounts, but he really wasn\u2019t in the thick of the Obamacare-repeal debate in 2017. Why not?\n\n\u201cWhen I was running, I actually thought that most Republicans believed in free-market stuff,\u201d Sasse replies. \u201cIt turns out that a very large share of Republicans actually are fine with government price-setting in health care as long as there\u2019s a Republican administration behind it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president likes to talk about how John McCain was the vote against [repealing] Obamacare, right. At the end of the day, there weren\u2019t 35 or 40 votes, let alone 60 or 51 . . . votes for an actual market-oriented health-care system that would deliver a higher quality, lower cost over time. It was just clear there was no actual coalition for this.\u201d\n\nSasse\u2019s point that there weren\u2019t the votes for a real free-market plan is fair enough, but it\u2019s hard to believe that the senator didn\u2019t realize that Senate Republicans weren\u2019t all committed free-market conservatives until he had been a member for several months. Sasse, after all, ran his 2014 campaign against establishment Republicans for failing to provide leadership.\n\nAlthough Sasse didn\u2019t live up to his billing as the GOP\u2019s anti-Obamacare hero, he did distinguish himself as a freshman senator in several ways.\n\nMany Republican senators are skittish about speaking out and leading on pro-life issues, but Sasse served as the lead Senate sponsor of the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, a bill that finally got a vote this year, after Virginia\u2019s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, made what Sasse describes as \u201cinsane and wicked comments\u201d about leaving infants born in the third trimester to die. \u201cThis is a core commitment and belief. I think we should be coming at it from lots of different sides,\u201d Sasse says of protecting the right to life.\n\nSasse was also out front pressuring the Department of Justice to investigate Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s \u201csweetheart deal\u201d with the federal government, even though a Trump cabinet official, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, was a former federal prosecutor involved in that deal.\n\nAmong senators on the Judiciary Committee, Sasse delivered the most substantive and impressive contribution to the debate during the first round of the Kavanaugh hearings; his \u201cSchoolhouse Rock\u201d speech about the separation of powers went viral. When Democrats on the committee tried to disqualify a judicial nominee for being a member of the Knights of Columbus, Sasse skewered the anti-Catholic attack. \u201cAre you now or have you ever been involved in the organization of a fish fry?\u201d Sasse asked judicial nominee Peter Phipps at one hearing.\n\nBut American politics hasn\u2019t focused on abortion, judges, religious liberty, or any other issue during Sasse\u2019s tenure. American politics has been dominated by the personality of one man\u2014Donald J. Trump\u2014for almost the entirety of Sasse\u2019s first term. Trump descended the escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential campaign in June 2015, a mere five months after Sasse became a senator and five months before Sasse delivered his maiden speech on the Senate floor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why, in the minds of many, Sasse\u2019s willingness to speak out when he thinks Trump crosses certain lines has come to define him as a senator.\n\nIn 2016, Sasse was one of the staunchest Republican critics of Trump. \u201cIf the Republican party becomes the party of David Duke, Donald Trump, I\u2019m out,\u201d Sasse told Morning Joe in March 2016. His spokesman said he would skip the July 2016 Republican National Convention so he could \u201ctake his kids to watch some dumpster fires across the state.\u201d Trump tweeted that year that Sasse looked like a \u201cgym rat.\u201d\n\nSasse was one of more than a dozen Senate Republicans who didn\u2019t vote for Trump in November 2016, but he has found himself increasingly alone as a Republican willing to break ranks with the president. Jeff Flake and Bob Corker retired. John McCain died. Mike Lee intends to endorse Trump in 2020. And Lindsey Graham became a neo-Trumper.\n\nAs recently as 2018, Sasse was quite critical of the president in public. He called Trump\u2019s trade war disastrous on Fox News. When Sasse was on MSNBC after the president called his former alleged mistress Stormy Daniels \u201chorseface,\u201d the senator simply said: \u201cThat\u2019s not the way men act.\u201d\n\nIn June, after Trump had held a joint press conference with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki at which he accepted Putin\u2019s denial\u2014contradicted by U.S. intelligence agencies and the available evidence\u2014that Russia was not behind the hacking of DNC emails in 2016, Sasse delivered a blistering speech on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cWe did not negotiate from a position of strength. We acted from a position of weakness. As a result, one of the world\u2019s worst despots walked away today from Helsinki with a win,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cThis should be a time for all Americans to stand together against what Putin\u2019s doing. It\u2019s a fundamental part of the president\u2019s job to articulate basic truths.\u201d\n\nBut in 2019, Sasse has been much more accommodating toward and reticent about the president. In March, much to the consternation of Sasse\u2019s Trump-skeptical supporters, he voted to uphold Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency that allowed the president to redirect military funds to the southern border. Sasse was willing to vote for a bill that would generally curb the power of presidents to declare national emergencies, but he was unwilling merely to rescind Trump\u2019s national emergency.\n\nIn July, President Trump tweeted that four Democratic congresswomen, all of whom happen to be racial minorities and three of whom were born in the United States, should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries from which they came.\n\nA number of Trump\u2019s Republican allies in the Senate condemned the remark. Tim Scott of South Carolina called Trump\u2019s comment \u201cracially offensive.\u201d Iowa senator Joni Ernst, who is up for reelection in 2020, was asked whether Trump\u2019s tweet was racist. \u201cUh, yeah. They\u2019re American citizens,\u201d she told CNN. Sasse did not speak out at the time, right as he was gearing up to announce his reelection campaign.\n\nDid Sasse think that comment was bigoted or racist? \u201cYeah, it was a terrible comment,\u201d he tells me in his Senate office. \u201cAnd a Republican senator just saying the same thing again\u201d to \u201csatisfy MSNBC\u201d is \u201cnot nearly as useful as saying what it means that we actually are a nation of immigrants.\u201d\n\nSasse says he hasn\u2019t been on Twitter for 13 of the last 18 months, both to be a better role model to his children and so that he doesn\u2019t contribute to a hyperactive news cycle of \u201c24/7 screaming.\u201d Yet the Trump-Ukraine scandal has compelled Sasse to speak up enough to anger Trump loyalists but not enough to satisfy Trump critics.\n\nWhen I speak to Sasse on September 30, I ask him whether he had any comment on the president\u2019s tweets that morning asserting that impeachment could cause a \u201cCivil War like fracture\u201d in America and another in which Trump asked whether Democratic congressman Adam Schiff should be arrested \u201cfor Treason.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess I don\u2019t have anything interesting to say,\u201d says Sasse, who is driving through Nebraska and hasn\u2019t heard about the president\u2019s comments until now. He goes on to criticize both Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Schiff for participating in a \u201cclown show,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t directly criticize the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then, on October 3, after President Trump publicly said that \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Sasse responded with a blunt statement to the Omaha World-Herald: \u201cAmericans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.\u201d\n\nIn the same statement, Sasse hit Representative Schiff for \u201crunning a partisan clown show in the House\u2014that\u2019s his right because the Constitution doesn\u2019t prohibit clown shows, but fortunately, in the Senate, we\u2019re working to follow the facts one step at a time.\u201d\n\nSasse\u2019s willingness to pick and choose his battles and make a point of showing Republican voters he hasn\u2019t joined the \u201cresistance\u201d will probably save him from suffering the same fate as Jeff Flake. Sasse is more than willing to acknowledge that Democrats are often crying wolf about the president, but he still feels compelled to say something, even in the middle of a Republican primary, when he believes the president is actually behaving like a wolf.\n\nBut don\u2019t get him wrong: Sasse would really, really like to be talking about other things. He is seeking a second term in part so he can play a role in the post-Trump fights within the Republican party. Sasse tells me he has a \u201ccalling,\u201d as \u201ca Tocquevillian or a principled pluralist or a constitutionalist,\u201d to fight for his own faction within the conservative coalition, which he now realizes is smaller than he once thought.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust that the big-business part of our coalition is ever going to defend federalism and argue against regulatory capture. I don\u2019t trust that populists are going to defend religious liberty and the rights of creedal minorities,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen populist Missouri GOP senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill earlier this year to require big social-media companies to prove to the federal government that they are not politically biased, Sasse was the only Republican senator out of more than a dozen I contacted to express opposition (most declined to comment). \u201cThe idea that you\u2019re going to empower the state to regulate speech and think that\u2019s not going to boomerang on cultural conservatives seems to be really shortsighted,\u201d he says. \u201cA new Fairness Doctrine for the Internet is going to harm conservatism badly in the long term.\u201d\n\nSasse also thinks he has a role to play promoting civics, serving on the Intelligence Committee, and debating issues about the future of work, such as universal basic income, a policy he fears is on the way but strongly opposes because it would balloon entitlements and make Americans even \u201clonelier and more purposeless.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t really want to spend very much of my time on Donald Trump,\u201d Sasse tells me in his Senate office on September 24. \u201cIf I get elected again,\u201d he says, his next term \u201cends in 2027. Whether Donald Trump wins or loses next November, he\u2019s almost three years gone from the national stage by the end of this term, and so I just find the obsession with Donald Trump to be a distraction\u201d from \u201cdoing the basic work of civics that we\u2019ve been neglecting for far too long.\u201d\n\nSasse may be so eager to move on to other fights that he has made a small error. If both men are reelected in 2020, Sasse will only have one year and 50 weeks left in his next Senate term after a second Trump presidential term ends, not three years. After accounting for this error, Sasse may need to increase his Senate stockpile of Bud Light, or switch to something harder.\n\n\u2014 This article appears in the October 28, 2019, issue of National Review.", "description": "The Nebraska senator who has clashed with Trump faces tough questions as he seeks reelection.", "authors": ["John Mccormack", "Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
