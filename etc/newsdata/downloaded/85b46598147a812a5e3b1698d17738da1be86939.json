(AP) - Despite serving six terms on the Mohegan Tribal Council, Mark Brown never counted on electoral success.\n\n\u201cEvery time I ran, I was nervous about winning,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cThis time was no different.\u201d\n\nHis doubts about securing a seventh term proved well founded when the results of weeks of secret-ballot voting among tribal members were revealed Aug. 25. Brown and a fellow incumbent, Joe Smith, a cousin seeking his second term, had been unseated by newcomers.\n\nHow much of it had to do with them being related to Brown\u2019s brother, Kevin, who resigned as the nine-member council\u2019s chairman in February, citing \u201cpersonal\u201d reasons? Did the circumstances of Kevin\u2019s departure - sources have said he was the subject of an ethics probe - cost them?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mark Brown said. \u201cI do think people look at us as individuals. \u2026 Politics have changed, on every level. It used to be you shook hands, you talked to people. Social media\u2019s now a tool to throw people off course.\u201d\n\nNearly a quarter-century\u2019s a long time in elective office, he said.\n\nLong enough to make enemies.\n\nFirst elected to the council in 1995, Brown won re-election to consecutive terms of varying lengths in 2000, 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2015. After garnering the most votes of any candidate in the 2000 election, the council elected him chairman, an office he held until 2005.\n\nHe recalled that when he joined the council, he briefly kept working part-time as a Montville police officer, a dual role that would now be unimaginable.\n\nNewly recognized by the federal government, the Mohegans soon focused on developing a casino. At the time, the very notion that the \u201clittle tribe on the hill\u201d could emulate what the Mashantucket Pequots had accomplished with Foxwoods Resort Casino seemed almost fanciful, Brown said.\n\n\u201cThe dynamics of that first group (the council elected in 1995) was the best,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an amazing time. Everything was changing, every day. It was an extreme learning curve.\u201d\n\nThe councilors\u2019 diverse backgrounds served to promote open conversations that led them to make the right decisions, Brown said.\n\n\u201cWe \u2018Moheganized\u2019 things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hired the best, people like (Mohegan Sun executives) Bill Velardo and Mitchell Etess, and they came in and said, \u2018This is how we do it in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018But we live here,\u2019 we\u2019d say. \u2018We know what people\u2019s expectations are \u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Moheganizing process meant treating employees like they were family members - listening to their complaints and accommodating their special circumstances, Brown said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not like a typical business. We\u2019re going to be here forever,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown said he was especially proud that when Mohegan Sun reached one of its milestones - its 15- or 20-year anniversary - some 2,400 employees had been with the casino since Day One, about two-thirds of those hired at the outset.\n\nIt\u2019s true that no Mohegan Sun workers have affiliated with a labor union.\n\nA \u201cmilitary brat\u201d who grew up on Montville\u2019s Fielding Terrace, Brown is a direct descendant of renowned Mohegan Chief Matahga and the son of Pauline Brown, a \u201cnonner,\u201d a designation the tribe accords its highly respected women. Brown\u2019s fond of an anecdote from his youth - the day his first-grade class at Mohegan School visited the nearby Tantaquidgeon Museum.\n\nThe class was met by Ruth Tantaquidgeon, Brown\u2019s great aunt, who, he said, \u201cgave me a hug, spun me around and held me in front of the class.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know the Indians?\u201d his wide-eyed classmates demanded.\n\nBrown believes the $30 million the tribe paid to widen Route 2A and create Mohegan Sun Boulevard was \u201cthe best thing we ever did,\u201d an example of the tribe\u2019s willingness to cooperate with the state and allay local concerns. A share of the Mohegan Sun slot-machine revenue the tribe sends to the state is doled out to Connecticut municipalities, and the tribe provides another $500,000 annually to Montville, its \u201chost community.\u201d\n\nFormer law enforcement officer that he is, Brown pointed to the 4,500 calls a year to which the tribe\u2019s police, fire and Emergency Medical Services personnel respond.\n\nDuring Brown\u2019s council tenure, Mohegan Gaming & Entertainment, the tribe\u2019s gaming arm, has reached far beyond Mohegan Sun to include ownership of Mohegan Sun Pocono in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and affiliations with Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City; ilani Casino Resort in La Center, Wash.; and Paragon Casino Resort in Marksville, La.\n\nMGE has gone international, too, assuming management control of casinos in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, and launching an integrated resort project in Incheon, South Korea. The company also expects to pursue casino licenses in Japan and Greece.\n\nBombarded by competitive threats, the tribe keeps striving to protect what it\u2019s already secured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much about growth as stability,\u201d Brown said.\n\nMohegan Sun \u201cprepared and overprepared\u201d for MGM Springfield, the Massachusetts resort casino that opened a year ago, an approach that may have helped mute the new facility\u2019s impact. Brown said he was heartened to hear MGM Springfield executives say they misjudged the loyalty of the Connecticut casinos\u2019 patrons.\n\nExpansion plans by New York City-area racetrack casinos seeking to add live table games may pose a greater threat to Mohegan Sun than the Massachusetts casinos, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mohegans and the Mashantuckets remain jointly committed to an East Windsor casino project and possibly one in Bridgeport as well, all of which is tied up in talks between the tribes and the governor\u2019s office.\n\nWhatever happens, \u201cwe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Brown promised. \u201cRight now, all parties are engaged.\u201d\n\nAfter 24 years in office, Brown didn\u2019t sound like he intended to disappear. He was asked if he plans to run for the council seat his brother\u2019s resignation opened a seat to be filled in an upcoming special election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got options I\u2019ve got to look at.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2lHVI4L\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Day, http://www.theday.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Despite serving six terms on the Mohegan Tribal Council, Mark Brown never counted on electoral success.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Hallenbeck"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
