(Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nPresident Trump has narrowed his list of candidates to replace John Bolton as national security adviser to five names, he said Tuesday. The list includes current and former members of his administration, but no household names.\n\nAs he flew to California for a political fundraising swing, Trump told reporters his short list:\n\n\u25cf U.S. hostage negotiator Robert O\u2019Brien\n\n\u25cf Army Maj. Gen. Ricky Waddell, the assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who also has served as deputy national security adviser;\n\n\u25cf Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty, Energy Department undersecretary for nuclear security;\n\n\u25cf Former Bolton chief of staff Fred Fleitz\n\n\u25cf Retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, who serves as the national security adviser to Vice President Pence\n\nTrump praised O\u2019Brien, with whom he has worked to try to free Americans held overseas.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Trump said. Waddell, he noted, \u201cI like a lot.\u201d\n\nHe also mentioned the 75-year-old Kellogg, who officials have suggested is a long shot.\n\n\u201cI love Keith Kellogg. Keith Kellogg, he\u2019s been with me from the beginning. He\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s list does not include two names that current and former Trump administration officials had previously said were in circulation: Iran policy chief Brian Hook and Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell.\n\nLater Tuesday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement suggesting the president is not limiting his consideration to the names he provided.\n\n\u201cAs the president said when speaking to the pool, the names of candidates mentioned for the NSA position was not the full list, and there are others being considered,\u201d she said.\n\nBolton left last week after differing with Trump on several policy matters, including the president\u2019s efforts to draw Iran into new negotiations. Bolton said he quit; Trump said he was fired.\n\n[Bolton\u2019s turbulent tenure comes to a Trumpian end]\n\nTrump had said he expected to name a replacement for Bolton this week, but two officials said the selection process has been complicated by the weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities, possibly delaying an announcement.\n\nTrump has said it appears likely that Iran is behind the attacks but that he will await more information.\n\nHook, a favorite of Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, is deeply involved in formulating a U.S. response and laying out options for Trump. The former Mitt Romney adviser has also come under criticism by some Trump loyalists for perceived sympathies with establishment \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans who opposed Trump\u2019s outsider candidacy.\n\nGrenell attended a dinner with Trump on Saturday amid speculation that he was in the running for Bolton\u2019s job. A senior administration official said, however, that Grenell was in Washington because he \u201chas been in discussions for weeks about another role the president wants him to play.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the selection process on the record.\n\nThe candidates Trump listed are all seasoned national security professionals with much lower profiles than the combative and media-savvy Bolton. That is by design, administration officials said, and is likely to solidify Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s role as the most influential Trump adviser. Pompeo and Bolton clashed frequently.\n\n[With Bolton\u2019s departure, Pompeo gets \u2018more running room\u2019]\n\nTrump\u2019s choice is also expected to preside over a further trimming of National Security Council staff.", "description": "President said he is looking at one former and four current members of his administration to replace John Bolton.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JpShATbrg7yjb39E4K36cMLLF0Q=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKS2Z6WVQYI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
