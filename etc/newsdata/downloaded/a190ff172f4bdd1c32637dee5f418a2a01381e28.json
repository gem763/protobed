They rode past a tractor towing a cattle trailer,' he wrote on the page.\n\n'We are still unsure of exactly what happened but the trailer overturned and landed on top of them.\n\nIt's a miracle they survived,' he said.\n\nBoth Lorna, 62, and 65-year-old Richard were placed in induced comas as doctors assessed their injuries.\n\nLorna is slowly being woken up after she underwent surgery to remove her leg, replace her hip and repair her pelvis.\n\nHer family say it went 'as well as could be expected'.\n\nShe will be required to wear a neck brace for stability, but Mr Cox says her recovery so far has been nothing short of 'great and positive'.\n\nRichard remains in a coma.\n\nBoth Lorna, 62, and 65-year-old Richard were placed in induced comas as doctors assessed their injuries\n\nHe suffered a stroke and ruptured aorta after the incident and doctors are yet to determine the neurological impact this had on him due to his sedation.\n\nHe is booked in to have a pelvis reconstruction but surgeons are waiting until his body beats an infection.\n\n'My uncle is still in a coma, so it's not clear how things are, but he's not in the best shape,' Mr Cox said.\n\nThe couple, who have travelled widely, are believed to have taken out travel insurance but the family are yet to find any documents detailing exactly what they're covered for.\n\nThey are hoping to raise $50,000 for treatment.\n\n'Due to the severity of their injuries we don't know how long it will be until we can bring them home, but we do know it will be a long recovery in Austria away from family and friends, followed by a long healing journey back home in Australia.\n\n'Any money donated will go straight to their sons Steve and Paul to cover all medical costs, equipment and anything associated with their long recovery and to bring them home,' the fundraising page read.\n\n'This will include rehab and anything they may need to help them adapt to new life challenges and difficulties they will now be facing.'", "description": "Lorna and Richard Hogg, from Victoria, planned the retirement getaway of their dreams, traversing through Europe on the back of motorbikes for three months.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/01/19468076-0-image-a-6_1570579271821.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
