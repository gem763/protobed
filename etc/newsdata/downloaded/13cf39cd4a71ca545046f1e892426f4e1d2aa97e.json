But for seasoned debate coaches who spoke with TheWrap, this year\u2019s Democratic presidential debates have seemingly valued soundbites over substance, as moderators have swung from topic to topic with surface-level breadth, and candidates have been left cramming in responses down to the very last second.\n\nIt\u2019s a case of competing needs: How do the networks create an interesting and engaging TV event while also providing the space and scope for candidates to demonstrate how they\u2019d think through issues, explain what they would do as president, and argue why they are the best choice for the job?\n\nSpokespersons for CNN and MSNBC did not respond to a request for comment. But after CNN hosted its second night of debates, CNN\u2019s Washington bureau chief, Sam Feist, told The Associated Press, \u201cIf we were doing the debate again tomorrow, we would do it exactly the same way.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: ABC News Announces Hosts and Rules for Third Democratic Presidential Debates\n\nThe major networks have tried to give audiences more time with specific candidates through televised town halls, where candidates answer audience questions about a single topic in a more intimate setting than the debates.\n\nBut town halls also have a downside: CNN\u2019s back-to-back climate change town halls, for example, ran over seven hours on Wednesday, and the format doesn\u2019t expose viewers to as many candidates at once. And, since there\u2019s no debate, viewers can\u2019t see candidates interact with each other in real time.\n\nDebate coaches\u2019 main issue with the recent Democratic debates, which are backed by the Democratic National Committee, is the amount of speaking time given to each candidate: 60 seconds per answer for the first two rounds of debates and 75 seconds for the upcoming ABC debate. One reason for the clipped responses is the number of candidates onstage.\n\nEd Lee, the senior director of the Barkley Forum for Debate, Deliberation, and Dialogue at Emory University, acknowledged that Twitterized attention spans have necessitated keeping the debates within a reasonable time frame. But he said that longer speaking-time allotments would better serve the public.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not pursuing the best mode of political communication and debate, but the most efficient way that fits the news cycle and what they want and what they need. Those are very different from what I think the public needs to make a coherent decision,\u201d Lee said. \u201cA debate with 10 people is not very useful unless you can allocate them sufficient amount of time.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: CNN's 2nd Democratic Debate Lands 10.7 Million Viewers, Up 23% From Tuesday's\n\nWith more speaking time, debate coaches said, candidates would be forced to push past surface-level talking points and demonstrate how they make decisions, implement policies, and think through complex problems.\n\nShunta Jordan, the chair of the executive board for the National Debate Coaches Association and head debate coach at the University of Georgia, suggested that candidates receive at least 90 seconds to respond to questions. Lee and Paul Hayes, the director of debate at George Washington University, both said they would want candidates to have at least five or six minutes of response time. In Houston, they will be allotted just 75 seconds.\n\nThe debate coaches also wished moderators would be more selective with the number and types of topics they raise during the debate, allowing candidates to get more into the specifics of their plans, and would avoid leading questions designed to pit specific candidates against each other.\n\nIn CNN\u2019s debate in July, for example, moderator Dana Bash raised a question that prompted what has since been described as a \u201crematch\u201d between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, who clashed over federal busing policies and school segregation at the June debate.", "description": "When Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas went head-to-head in a series of seven presidential debates in 1858, each man was given an hour for an opening, followed by the other candidate speaking for 90 minutes, then the first candidate rebutting for 30 minutes \u2014 totaling over 20 hours \u2014 to passionately", "authors": ["J.
