We pulled back from there, as we started to see plenty of exhaustion. Looking at this chart, it\u2019s obvious that we are in a downtrend and I do think that it\u2019s only a matter of time before we break down significantly. On a weekly close below the 1.10 level underneath we could see a longer-term move down towards the 100% Fibonacci retracement level. That could send this market as low as the 1.04 or so, but quite frankly it is going to take quite a bit of time to get there.\n\nEUR USD Forecast Video 16.09.19\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve is very likely to cut interest rates, at the end of the day it\u2019s likely that the interest rate differential will continue to favor the United States regardless. At this point, if you\u2019re going to buy bonds you don\u2019t necessarily want to do so in the European Union because they are all negative interest rate yielding. However, even as low as interest rates are the United States, they are at least still positive.\n\nAt this point, there is a lot of choppiness I think that it\u2019s probably easier to trade this market on short-term charts such as the daily time frame, but overall attitude of this market is most certainly to the downside. The Euro has to deal with the fact that Germany is entering a recession, Italy is already there, and of course there is a huge issue with many of the other member countries.\n\nPlease let us know what you think in the comments below\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The Euro was all over the place during the week as we had an ECB press conference, as you would expect. Having said that, it had a significant bounce after the interest rate decision, but on Friday we also started to see selling pressure again. We are in a downtrend, and that\u2019s the most important thing", "authors": ["Christopher Lewis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
