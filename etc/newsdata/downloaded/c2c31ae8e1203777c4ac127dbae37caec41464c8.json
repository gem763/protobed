Now, new ventures are slowly reviving it\n\nThe majority of Kabul\u2019s cinemas cater largely to audiences of young men, and tend to show Bollywood films produced in Pakistan and India. For some young Afghan men, the cinema is a rare occasion for public expressions of joy: audience members cheer on the films\u2019 heroes and sometimes dance along.\n\nFor most women, however, fears of harassment in a male-dominated space have made cinemas feel unwelcoming.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine an Afghan woman being comfortable sitting in a dark room with hundreds of men,\u201d said Jonathan Saruk, a photographer who has documented the cinemas of Kabul.\n\nGoing to the cinema has become taboo, especially for women Shahim Nadery, I-Khanom manager\n\nThis year, however, in an attempt to revive film culture in Kabul, the documentary maker Diana Saqeb Jamal launched a new venture: I-Khanom, a cinema that aims to provide a safe environment for women and families to watch films. The name means Lady Moon, and comes from a city supposedly founded by Alexander the Great.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The majority of Kabul\u2019s cinemas show Bollywood films and cater to audiences of young men.

Most had never seen a film in a cinema before.\n\n\u201cGoing to the cinema has become taboo, especially for women,\u201d says I-Khanom manager Shahim Nadery. Most parents, he says, would not allow their daughters to attend.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cinemas in Afghanistan are generally male-dominated spaces that many women feel uncomfortable attending. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters\n\nI-Khanom, the newest addition to Book City Cultural Centre, which also includes a cafe and art gallery, is different. \u201cIt all started from the environment we build in Book City,\u201d Nadery says. While many women in Kabul don\u2019t feel secure outside their homes at night, Book City has earned a reputation as a safe space for cultural activities.\n\nIn 2014, a suicide bomber attacked a film screening at the French Culture Centre in Kabul, killing several people and injuring at least 15. The centre had been one of the few places that was welcoming to both film-makers and female audience members. The bombing was another blow to cinema culture in Afghanistan, a vibrant tradition that has largely been lost over years of conflict.\n\nI-Khanom is an effort to move forward from that blow. It holds special women-only showings every Tuesday afternoon, while Fridays are dedicated to families with children. Students from the faculty of arts at Kabul University, home to one of the country\u2019s few cinematography schools, make up a big part of most audiences.\n\n\u201cIt will take time for people to have trust, but until then, we are doing our best,\u201d Nadery says. \u201cEven if we just have one viewer, we will prepare the hall so they feel safe to come.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kabul\u2019s Cinema Park in the 1950s.

Cinema thrived here in the 1960s and 1970s, but when the Soviets invaded in 1979 they imposed strict censorship rules, and when the Taliban came to power the production and viewing of films was banned entirely. Afghan Film Institute staff risked their lives to save the organisation\u2019s film archives.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say the culture of cinema is new,\u201d Nadery points out. \u201cIt\u2019s forgotten.\u201d\n\nHe recalls an older audience member at I-Khanom sharing his memories of a time when movie screenings in Kabul were standing-room only. \u201cWhen we heard that, it gave us this feeling of how lost we are.\u201d\n\nToday, Afghan film-makers rely on budgets from foreign organisations, and the movies they produce are often only shown outside the country. \u201cWe want to give our film-makers an opportunity where they will have an audience, to see that Afghan films have a market in Afghan society,\u201d Nadery says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The auditorium of I-Khanom, which hopes to be a safe space for women and supportive to the Afghan film industry.

As recently as 22 September, at least 40 civilians at a wedding party were reportedly killed during a raid by Afghan special forces on a Taliban hideout.\n\nNadery hopes I-Khanom can offer fresh hope in that grim context: \u201cWe want to provide an alternative, a source of entertainment so that even for five minutes, people don\u2019t feel they are in a war-torn country.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Cinema once thrived in Afghanistan until Taliban censorship.
