The public was on a good level \u2013 I didn\u2019t hear any bad language used towards their or our players.\u201d\n\nBalakov, who had suggested before the game that England had a bigger problem with racism than Bulgaria, said after the defeat: \u201cI personally did not hear the chanting. I saw the referee stopped the game but I also have to say the behaviour was also not only on behalf of the Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgarian national anthem. During the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe comments by Iliev and Balakov contrasted heavily with those of the captain Ivelin Popov, who had tried to calm things during the game by speaking to some of the fans. \u201cFirst, I tried to talk with the stewards who were supposed to control the situation,\u201d the Rostov midfielder said. \u201cWe\u2019re all suffering from that kind of behaviour. Do you think a foreign player would like to come and play in Bulgaria after what happened tonight? Racism is a world problem that needs to be eradicated. We\u2019re all people regardless of the skin colour.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThe racist chanting dominated the headlines in Bulgaria on Tuesday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no light! It\u2019s been buried beneath six goals and tons of shame,\u201d read the headline of the sports website Gong.bg, with the accompanying piece saying: \u201cBulgarian football and the country as a whole suffered one of the most shameful nights in its entire history \u2013 not only was the national team beaten 6-0 by England but the game was twice stopped for racist chants. A handful of fans stained not only Bulgarian football but Bulgaria as a country after racially abusing the England internationals.\u201d\n\nAnother sports website, Sportal.bg, went with \u201cSuch a shame! A historic humiliation\u201d, while one of the most famous TV pundits in Bulgaria, Borislav Borisov, said: \u201cEvery country\u2019s national team is an institution but on Monday night our national team was destroyed. With the way England reacted to the racial abuse they wanted to make a statement \u2013 they wanted to stand up against racism and they did it.\u201d", "description": "The Bulgaria goalkeeper Plamen Iliev has said that the home fans \u2018behaved well\u2019 during the Euro 2020 qualifier against England", "authors": ["Metodi Shumanov In Sofia"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15fa123f6bec3ef8c25187608fba9b1c21c9627/0_327_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c05832b246daf9963ad8e8ade5574ad", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
