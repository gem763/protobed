When Donald Trump does something that upsets the sensibilities of liberal journalists, or they think they can get some mileage out of pretending they\u2019re upset, it gets non-stop coverage. When it\u2019s a Democrat, it might as well not have happened. Consider the case of the \u201cTrump chant\u201d vs. the situational deafness of Kamala Harris.\n\nIt was the chant heard \u2018round the world \u2013 \u201cSend her back!\u201d When the crowd at a Trump rally in North Carolina chanted it about anti-Semitic alleged homewrecker Ilhan Omar, it was national news. For a week, cable news hosts expressed outrage at how the president could have allowed the chant to continue for \u201c13 seconds!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s right, 13 whole seconds.\n\nThat\u2019s not a lot of time, but when you\u2019re made aware of it, it can seem like it. And \u201cjournalists\u201d wanted people to be aware of it. CNN ran the footage with a counter on the screen. As if that weren\u2019t enough, two of the dumbest people to ever read a teleprompter \u2013 Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo \u2013 reenacted the silence on air. It was the smartest thing either has ever said.\n\nMissing from all the coverage was a few simple truths.\n\nFirst, 13 seconds is nothing at a rally. The president was derided for saying he quieted the crowd by resuming speaking as soon as he heard what the crowd was chanting. It\u2019s true. When crowds at other rallies chanted \u201cLock her up\u201d or \u201cCNN sucks,\u201d the president gleefully peacocked around the stage, reveling the energy of the venue. That didn\u2019t happen in North Carolina.\n\nSecond, why assume the president heard the chant from the moment the cameras did? If you\u2019ve ever been at a sporting event where the crowd starts taunting a ref, umpire, or player, it\u2019s not easy to understand a crowd when a chant first starts. It has to be repeated several times and spread to a large percentage of the people before you really know what they\u2019re saying.\n\nThe cameras at the Trump rally were well in the back of the venue, with mics attached to them to get the ambient noise of the crowd. The mics picked up the chant from the back of the crowd long before the president could make it out over the natural noise of the event.\n\nAll of this is irrelevant because who cares if a few liberals on TV clutched their pearls over a chant at a political rally? They clutch their pearls so often and so hard that their hands are fused to them, like the fat guy who grows into his easy chair.\n\nIt\u2019s only relevant when you compare the reaction to it to the reporting surrounding 2020 Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris and her convenient deafness the other day.\n\nA man in New Hampshire, after a mini-monologue, asked Harris, \u201cWhat are you going to do in the next one year to diminish the mentally retarded action of this guy?\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cretarded\u201d has been shadow banned since at least the '90s. Being a good Democrat, Harris should have chastised the man immediately and moved on. She didn\u2019t.\n\nRather than calling out the man, Harris laughed along with the crowd and responded, \u201cWell said, well said,\u201d then gave him an answer. This would be the end of a Republican\u2019s campaign, but Harris is a Democrat.\n\nIn an interview the next day, Harris apologized and claimed she hadn\u2019t heard the comment, which is as believable as saying JFK committed suicide. He spoke them into a microphone, the crowd and candidate laughed at the moment it would\u2019ve been a punchline, and she answered the question. If this were Donald Trump, rather than a Democrat mocking Donald Trump, all presses across the country would\u2019ve been ordered stopped as the networks broke into programming to inform the world of the latest awful, horrible, insensitive, mean-spirited, racist, sexist (these last 2 are just Pavlovian responses of leftists) the president was involved in.\n\nBut Harris is a Democrat, so the Washington Post story on the event read, \u201cHarris apologizes after seeming to agree that Trump\u2019s policies are \u2018mentally retarded.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nSeeming to? She laughed, praised his comment, then answered the question. Are cautious politicians known for recklessly answering questions they only heard part of? Of course not. But when you\u2019ve committed an offense against the woke army, even the generals will lie to protect themselves.\n\nIt is very easy to ask, \u201cWhat if Trump had done it?\u201d But sometimes it has to be asked. And every single time it is, the answer is clear: there are two sets of rules, one for Republicans and none for Democrats.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "It\u2019s amazing how similar events, or \u201coffenses,\u201d are treated based .09/10/2019 3:41:53AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/502723a6-7627-4299-9563-e156bae92961.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
