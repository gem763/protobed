(Photo: Facebook)\n\nA man and his disabled grandson painted a portrait of the American flag for President Trump \u2014 and the White House responded with a heartfelt letter.\n\nRandy Hogue of Powder Springs, Georgia and his grandson Gage, who is autistic, blind, and mostly nonverbal, hope that their artwork, titled \u201cThe Crying Flag,\u201d will help spread awareness about children with disabilities.\n\n\"If there is a disabled person, you have to understand. All they want to do is be included, just be included in life,\u201d Hogue told WSB-TV.\n\nFor Hogue, that means having his grandson, Gage, join in on a favorite hobby: painting. \"It really excites him to think he achieved something,\" Hogue told the station. \"Everybody knows he didn't paint it on his own. But it's his painting.\"\n\nHogue had a few prints of the painting made for friends and family. And last month, the grandfather and grandson sent one to the White House for President Trump, along with a letter describing Gage's story.\n\nA month later, they received a response from the president. \"Thank you for the beautiful painting of the American Flag that you and your Pawpaw made. You are a very talented artist!\" the letter reads. \"The Stars and Stripes are a meaningful source of inspiration and pride to all Americans. Your patriotism and perseverance encourage me as I continue to work hard for our Nation.\"\n\nAlong with an autographed photo, Trump sent a copy of it in braille.\n\nHowever, it is the last part of the letter that caused Hogue to tear up, as faith has always been a staple in their home.\n\n\"You are beautifully made in the image of God, and I hope you always remember that you are loved and cherished by so many,\" the letter concluded. \"God bless you and your family.\"\n\nRandy Hough did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A Georgia boy who is blind, autistic and mostly nonverbal, painted a portrait of the American flag for President Trump.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DvHtw04QkqBpuOQ5Y_nymQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTQ0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/39b28630-ce99-11e9-bff7-cee1119631d6"}
