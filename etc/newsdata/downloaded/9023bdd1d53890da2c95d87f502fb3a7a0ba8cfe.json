We Co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann also ratcheted back the potency of his voting rights to 10 votes per share from 20, reversing a recent enhancement to their power. Mr. Neumann still retains majority voting control, but the company said the board has the ability to remove him as CEO.\n\nThe company also eliminated a provision in which his wife, Rebekah Neumann \u2014also a We co-founder\u2014would play a key role in choosing Mr. Neumann\u2019s successor if he dies or is permanently disabled in the next 10 years.\n\nThe company also said that Mr. Neumann, who previously pledged he wouldn\u2019t sell shares for a year after the IPO, would sell no more than 10% of his stake in the second and third years after the offering.\n\nPotential investors also have questioned Mr. Neumann\u2019s sales of hundreds of millions of dollars of We stock and loans of more than $740 million tied to his shares in the company that were detailed in Wall Street Journal reports and regulatory filings.\n\nIt is still unclear whether these changes will be enough to assuage investors who have balked at Mr. Neumann\u2019s unusual relationship to his company, his leadership and the board\u2019s ability to check his power.\n\nThe company is expected to set a preliminary price range for the IPO by next week, and We and its advisers are targeting a valuation that could slip below $20 billion, as the Journal has previously reported. That is significantly lower than the $47 billion valuation set in a funding round earlier this year, reflecting skepticism over the company\u2019s governance and its ability to reverse steep losses.\n\nRelated Video The We Co.\u2019s public offering is expected to come as early as September. But some investors are saying it might not be worth the risk. Here\u2019s why.

With ample private capital and a dearth of IPOs, founders of fast-growing technology startups in recent years have been able to dictate terms that give them extra control in proportion to their ownership and other benefits like bonuses tied to public offerings.\n\nCompanies including Facebook Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Snap Inc. have supervoting structures that give their founders control. Lyft Inc. changed its voting structure shortly before its IPO earlier this year to give its founders majority control.\n\nWe officials and their advisers have been in an intensive series of meetings in recent days as questions swirl over whether the company will go through with the offering, one of the biggest in what could be a record year for new issues. But the choosing of a listing venue\u2014earlier reported by the Journal\u2014together with the expected valuation cut and governance overhaul, show that it has decided to plow forward, even if that means raising less than it had originally hoped.\n\nOne major motivating factor is $6 billion in loans We has arranged that are contingent on at least $3 billion being raised in the share offering.\n\nThe IPO frenzy this year has kicked up a heated battle between the NYSE and Nasdaq, which see big IPOs as franchise-defining opportunities that can help land subsequent business, become key marketing tools and represent new sources of trading revenue. The listing of We has been seen as one of the biggest prizes of the second half of the year after Nasdaq landed Lyft and the New York Stock Exchange landed Uber Technologies Inc. and the direct listing of Slack Technologies Inc. in the first half.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Peloton Interactive Inc. is planning to debut on Nasdaq, and Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., the parent company of Hollywood\u2019s biggest talent agency, is slated to start trading on the NYSE.\n\nWe waited an unusually long time to decide on an exchange. Typically, large companies select one by the time they file publicly for an IPO. There are some companies that wait longer, but the most-buzzed-about IPOs of the past few years have picked a trading venue much further in advance of We\u2019s timing, coming just days before the start of its investor roadshow.\n\nDespite questions and concerns from investors, Mr. Neumann has said privately he is committed to moving forward with the IPO.\n\nIn conversations earlier this week with executives of SoftBank Group Corp. , the company\u2019s largest shareholder, Mr. Neumann said he doesn\u2019t expect anything fundamental to the business to change in the next year, and that he thinks the most important thing now is to get a large infusion of cash so he can continue his expansion plans, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com and Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com", "description": "WeWork\u2019s parent agreed to make sweeping governance changes and chose Nasdaq for its exchange, as the shared-workspace provider scrambles to keep its closely watched initial public offering on track.", "authors": ["Maureen Farrell", "Corrie Driebusch", "Maureen.Farrell Wsj.Com", "Corrie.Driebusch Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105381/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
