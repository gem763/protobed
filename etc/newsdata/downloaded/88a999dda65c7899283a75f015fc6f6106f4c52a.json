Even Trump allies have warned that chaos in the area could lead to an IS resurgence.\n\nUS Secretary of Defence Mark Esper said on CBS that Trump had directed the deliberate withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria due to an expected increase in military action. Esper said the US had learned in the past 24 hours that Turkey was likely to attack further south and west and that Kurdish forces were looking to cut a deal with Assad and Russia to counterattack.\n\n\"We have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies, and it's a very untenable situation,\" Esper said. \"We want to make sure we don't put our soldiers in a situation where they could be killed or injured.\"\n\nThe Kurdish leadership said that while the SDF had fought hard, Turkey was pressing ahead with its campaign. \"To prevent and confront this assault, we agreed with the Syrian government, who's duty it is to defend the borders of the country and protect the sovereignty of Syria, to enter and spread out across Syria's border with Turkey,\" to help liberate the areas under Turkish control, it said in a statement.\n\nFor the Kurds, inviting in Assad could come at a heavy price. The move may succeed in pushing Turkey back across the border but will likely mean allowing Damascus to take back control over the north-east after eight years of bruising civil war that has claimed some 500,000 lives and displaced millions.\n\nFacing a backlash at home and abroad, Trump has defended his move by saying he did not support the Turkish offensive. On Sunday (Monday AEDT), he said the US Treasury had further sanctions ready to impose on Turkey. He gave no timeline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean Union leaders may also settle on an arms embargo on Turkey over its advance into Syria as soon as this week, four officials familiar with the discussions said. Germany and France said at the weekend they stopped shipments of military equipment to their NATO ally.\n\nEU government envoys in Brussels discussed on Sunday the draft of a decision adopting punitive measures against Turkey over Syria, as well as its drilling activities off the coast of Cyprus.\n\nAccording to a copy of the draft communique, due to be adopted by EU foreign ministers on Monday and seen by Bloomberg, the bloc's nations will vow to coordinate on imposing an arms embargo against Turkey and take one more step in the process of adopting sanctions against Turkish individuals and companies involved in Mediterranean drilling operations.\n\nBut two officials familiar with Sunday's debate said the wording in the statement will change, as many member states want tougher language: Cyprus, supported by Greece, wants a decision on drilling sanctions now, including asset freezes, travel bans, and a ban on exports of equipment which can be used for hydrocarbon exploration.\n\nFrance, supported by several member states, is pushing for stronger language on the arms exports ban. Sweden, supported by the Netherlands and Denmark, wants the EU to condemn the Syrian operation in stronger terms. The final decision may be left to ministers meeting in Luxembourg, on Monday.\n\nBloomberg", "description": "The Syrian President sent troops to the north-east of the country to confront a Turkish offensive, raising risks of an escalation after Kurdish fighters turned to Damascus in the absence of US support.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78ddfaa0def54b6b49737c61941bafcc748034c9", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
