But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nWashington observers winced at Mr. Trump\u2019s use of the word, since it evoked horrific crimes against black Americans in the U.S. South.\n\n\u201cIt is not a lynching. Let\u2019s not start dropping words that are important with real historic meaning where we water them down to nothing,\u201d conservative commentator Erick Erickson tweeted.\n\nHouse Majority Whip James Clyburn, South Carolina Democrat who is African American, said the president \u201chas always been pretty loose with his words, and this is another indication of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really believe this man is prone to inflammatory statements,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cand that is one word that no president ought to apply to himself.\u201d\n\nRep. Bobby L. Rush, Illinois Democrat, was more emphatic.\n\n\u201cYou think this impeachment is a LYNCHING? What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cDo you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you. Delete this tweet.\u201d\n\n\u2022 David Sherfinski contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
