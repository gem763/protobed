It makes it more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together. It doesn't make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now ... all the processes that we're putting in place and investing in, now we're more fragmented.\"", "description": "\"If someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,\" Zuckerberg said in leaked audio from July.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d935cef2e22af3a601f064d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
