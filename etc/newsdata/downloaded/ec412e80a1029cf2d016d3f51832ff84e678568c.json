Organised by SCMP Young Post, the hackathon-style challenge received strong backing from title sponsor Sun Life Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the two-day event, more than 120 local secondary students teamed up with 16 overseas students from Beijing, Guangdong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, before competing against each other to put forward the best proposal to protect the ocean.\n\nAfter the pitching of plans, the team from St Margaret's Co-educational English Secondary & Primary School clinched first place with their design for a beach-cleaning robot that collects plastic waste. The team from Good Hope School, and a joint team from Victoria Shanghai Academy and Cheung Sha Wan Catholic Secondary School, took second and third places respectively.\n\nThe winning team from St Margaret's Co-educational English Secondary & Primary School with their beach-cleaning rotor.

This was to devise a plan to monitor, reduce or control marine pollution. Students were given time to discuss their approach and their proposed invention before working on a prototype and preparing a presentation.\n\nTo inspire innovative sustainable designs, the Hong Kong Science Park organised short tours for the youngsters to learn about some of the green features around their complex.\n\nMoira C Lopez, a 17-year-old student from the Philippines, said she learned a lot from the tour. \u201cSome of the features were quite impressive. For instance, the walls covered with green plants and formulated soil that helps to filter and clean the air.\u201d\n\nShe has a special interest in learning about environmental conservation because her country is directly affected by climate change. \u201cI come from the Philippines, which relies heavily on agriculture. So most of the research we do in our school focuses on taking care of the environment and preserving the ecosystem. I believe that is important for every one of us\u201d.\n\nVideo of Sun Life x Young Post International STEMathon 2019 Event Highlights\n\nOscar Wong, head of client development for Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, described the Science Park as \u201cHong Kong\u2019s first smart region living lab\u201d. \u201cIt is the ideal test-bed for these innovations before wider adoption in our city,\u201d he said. He added that various green design features throughout the park serve to advocate sustainable building practices, which he hopes others will learn from and follow suit. \u201cThrough this, we want to deliver economic and social benefits for Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the tour ended, students were quick to get back to their tasks, making full use of the basic materials available to them, such as cardboard, wooden planks, wheels, tools, and even a mini 3D printer. Each team could also purchase any additional materials they might need for their invention.\n\nIf students needed practical advice on certain areas of science, such as engineering and coding, a group of specialists was on hand to answer their queries.\n\nAfter about 30 hours in total, every team had finalised their prototype and was then invited on stage to demonstrate it and pitch their proposal to a panel of judges. At this point, it was important to give a clear explanation of the core concepts behind their designs in just a few minutes. In addition, though, each team also had to answer questions from the judges or the floor. This made the process just like a real hackathon, where aspiring entrepreneurs have to win over investors in a very limited time.\n\nAbout 140 students competed at the STEMathon over the course of two days.

Their proposal for cleaning up plastic waste with an automated cart outshone other projects by being highly practical and having a clearly positive impact on the environment.\n\nPerry Law, a Form 4 student and a member of the team, admitted that the process had not been easy and their design had gone through plenty of changes.\n\n\u201cWe faced a lot of dilemmas before settling on the final design, such as whether to use threads or wheels, conveyor belts or rollers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was especially hard when we kept coming up with new ideas while we were already making the prototype.\u201d\n\nHe noted that it was fun to work with students from outside Hong Kong. \u201cOur teammate, Tony Wang, is from Beijing. At first, it was a bit awkward talking to him and we were rather quiet. But by sharing our thoughts on different ideas, we got to know each other better and were cooperating very well by the end.\u201d\n\nLaw added that without Wang\u2019s coding skills, their cart would never have worked so well.\n\nWhen asked about the students\u2019 performance, Haymans Fung, chief marketing officer at Sun Life Hong Kong, said she was delighted.\n\n\u201cIt was wonderful to be here and witness the enthusiasm, dynamism and science-based creativity of the STEMathon teams,\u201d she said. \u201cSun Life always strives to build a positive environment for people in Hong Kong. For that reason, we support events that help the community and advocate sustainability.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, she added, Sun Life hoped to see these talented young people from Hong Kong and other parts of Asia become full-fledged scientists, who can use their STEM knowledge to protect the oceans.\n\nAlex Ho, general manager for recruitment, circulation and syndication business at the South China Morning Post, shared that sense of excitement.\n\n\u201cI was thoroughly impressed by the dedication and rigour displayed by these students. At the end of the first day, instead of returning to their homes or hotels for dinner, some of them chose to stay behind at Science Park to discuss and refine their work.\u201d he said.\n\nHe also noted that the STEMathon had achieved its purpose by providing a space for students to solve real-life issues with their STEM knowledge. \u201cI believe by working on a hackathon project with their peers from overseas, students from Hong Kong can get a taste of what it feels like to work in an international setting.\u201d He noted too that the STEMathon is one of the largest secondary school hackathons in which both local and international students take part.\n\nAs a host for the event and one of the judges, Jimmy Wong complimented the excellent collaboration between visiting students and local students.\n\n\u201cIt is rare to see hackathons open to secondary school students, and even rarer for these events to include students from overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite spending only 30 hours on their projects, they succeeded in impressing us by turning innovative ideas into tangible solutions. Their projects shed light on several different problems our ocean is facing, such as oil spillage, noise pollution, and plastic pollution, which is currently of most concern.\u201d\n\nEdited by John Cremer\n\nAbout Sun Life Financial:\n\nFor more than 125 years, Sun Life Financial has been here to grow together with the people of Hong Kong.
