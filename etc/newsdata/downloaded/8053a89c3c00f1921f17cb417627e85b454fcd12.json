It's a holiday to remember and feel connected to loved ones who've passed on.\n\nIn honour of the annual celebration, Brenda Cortes, co-owner of San Jose Mexican Foods in Ottawa, is whipping up a special recipe for her maternal grandmother who died last year: black bean tamales and mole.\n\nCortes's grandmother was vegetarian, almost vegan, so naturally her recipe is meat-and-dairy-free to suit her tastes.\n\n\"She said always cook with love,\" Cortes told CBC Radio's All In A Day. \"She used to say never cook angry because the food will be more spicy.\"\n\nLess philosophically and more practically, Cortes also advises against soaking beans. She adds them dry to boiling water for cooking.\n\n\"It's the secret to a very good black bean tamale,\" she said.\n\nTamales can be stuffed with a variety of fillings including fish, beef and chicken. Brenda Cortes's tamales, however, are vegan to honour her maternal grandmother.
