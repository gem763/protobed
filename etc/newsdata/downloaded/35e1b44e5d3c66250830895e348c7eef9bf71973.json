In that role, Yoo will be investing in all the ways healthcare is paid for and administered. In short, her thesis will be: software is eating care delivery.\n\nTo date, Andreessen Horowitz has launched two biofunds, which in total have $650 million to invest in startups focused on the intersection of biology and technology. The company has also made some bets on healthcare companies like health insurance startup Devoted Health.\n\nGoing forward, the hope is to go deeper into the intersection of technology and the ways healthcare is paid for and delivered.\n\n\"You're seeing the next generation of companies emerging who are tackling the space,\" Conde said.\n\nRead more: Meet the 8 companies changing how doctors get paid and building the future of medicine\n\nTo capture that, the team brought in Yoo. Yoo joined Andreessen Horowitz earlier in 2019 as a partner after nearly a decade working at Kyruus, an enterprise software company she cofounded that helps health systems match and schedule patients with doctors within the system. She's a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she was pre-med and majored in computer science.\n\nEarlier this year, Yoo was featured on Business Insider's list of the 25 rising stars in venture capital.\n\nHer background deep within the intersection of tech and care delivery is what made the biofund team bring her in to vet additional investments.\n\n\"We needed someone to go deep to make sure we're backing the best,\" Conde said.\n\nYoo told Business Insider that one of the reasons she was keen to join Andreessen Horowitz was a gap she saw in venture investing\n\nYoo would often find investors who came from a healthcare background but who didn't necessarily understand all that the company was going for from a software perspective, or tech investors who understood the software but weren't as tuned in to healthcare.\n\n\"I really felt that gap in the middle,\" Yoo said.\n\nWhy the way the US delivers care is changing\n\nWhen it comes to finding new investments, Yoo said she sees three factors driving the momentum behind new companies at the intersection of care delivery and technology.\n\nFirst, the implementation of electronic health records at health systems. Yoo lived through a period of time when that infrastructure was still being laid down. Now that it has, health systems are able to lift up their heads and explore new ways to do more with that technology and make it a better experience for those using it.\n\nThe second is the financial pressures on the healthcare system. Americans are on the hook for higher healthcare costs than ever, and because of that, they want more for what they're stuck paying.\n\n\"If we're going to pay more, our expectations rise as far as customer service and customer experience,\" Yoo said. In turn, healthcare companies that have long neglected customer service will need to scramble to change and not lose their business to others.\n\nFinally, Yoo said, the new ways healthcare is being paid for are leading to new and existing companies to get creative. For instance, hospitals are putting more of their services outside the hospital and companies from Devoted Health to large health systems are finding new ways to pay for the care of aging Americans.\n\nHere's what Yoo is looking to invest in\n\nYoo said she'll be focused on three particular areas where software can augment care delivery.", "description": "Andreessen Horowitz tapped Julie Yoo as its next general partner focused on finding companies that prove \"software is eating care delivery.\"", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cee813b33a710dc4d3424?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
