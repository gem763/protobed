We will provide crews for your cargo ships, and state-owned enterprises in China will give you lots of contracts to ship our goods around Asia.'\u201d\n\nSchweizer continued, \u201cAnd what you\u2019ve seen as that relationship has budded, is basically that Mitch McConnell has become a lot less critical of the Chinese government, and this is essentially what the Chinese are playing at. They\u2019ve done it in Australia. They\u2019ve done it in New Zealand [and] other parts of Asia. They are quite confident that the way to deal with adversarial countries or countries that are resistant to their policies is essentially [is to] try to buy off the political class, and they\u2019ve had some success in doing that, and they\u2019re doing that in the United States today.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nSchweizer noted how Joe Biden\u2019s geopolitical analysis of China changed following his youngest son, Hunter Biden, launching a private equity firm with $1.5 billion in financing from the Chinese state.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden was basically a hawk on China for most of his Senate career in the \u201980s and \u201990s, even up until the early parts of the Obama administration,\u201d Schweizer remarked. \u201cJoe Biden has basically said, \u2018We should welcome a rising China. China is not a threat. There is benefit to China becoming stronger, because they will be more like us.'\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is going to eat our lunch? C\u2019mon man,\u201d said Biden in May, further dismissing China as a geopolitical threat, \u201cThey\u2019re not a competition for us.\u201d\n\nOlsen contrasted news media focus on alleged foreign-rooted conflicts of interest between President Donald Trump and those of Joe Biden via Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in China and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe thing that gets me is that Hunter Biden is obviously a troubled individual,\u201d Olsen stated. \u201cThe New Yorker magazine profile of him goes into enormous detail about his troubles. For three years, we\u2019ve been hearing about every little thing about the Trump children or the Trump administration, and how awful it is that foreign dignitaries stay at the Trump Hotel in DC because they might be currying favor with the president, and how terrible it is that Chinese investors are buying condos in Jared Kushner\u2019s family\u2019s buildings, and yet here we\u2019ve got this troubled person, who Joe Biden obviously loves, who is raking in cash well beyond his expertise, and supposedly we\u2019re not supposed to be worried about it. The double standard here is just glaring.\u201d\n\nOlsen added, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you can imagine some sort of shakedown deal. You can almost imagine somebody going up to [Joe Biden] and saying, \u2018Nice son you\u2019ve got there. Shame if something were to happen to him.\u2019 It\u2019s very troubling. You don\u2019t even have to say that [Joe Biden] has changed his mind [on China.] The fact is Hunter Biden\u2019s future is now indebted to people and regimes that are potentially hostile to the United States, and definitely regimes that we want to have an interest in, and he, unfortunately, has a personal stake [in this] because of his son\u2019s involvement. That\u2019s news, and it\u2019s as much news as when the president of Ukraine says, \u2018Oh, I stayed in the Trump Tower when I was in New York.\u2019 In fact, I\u2019d say it\u2019s even more so.\u201d\n\nAsked by Mansour for solutions to combating foreign procurement of political influence through business relationships with politicians\u2019 family members, Schweizer proposed legislation modeled after the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the paradox,\u201d replied Schweizer, \u201cA few years ago \u2026 one of [J.P. Morgan\u2019s] subsidiaries was fined hundreds of millions of dollars by the federal government of the United States because what their subsidiary did was hire the children of Communist Party officials in China with the explicit hope of getting favorable treatment from the Chinese government. So they paid a large fine for that, and that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which means you are not allowed to provide a favor or a benefit to a foreign government officials in exchange for favorable treatment.\u201d\n\nSchweizer continued, \u201cHere\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for a reason. It does not apply in the United States. If J.P. Morgan did what they did in China and got fined for \u2014 if they did the same thing in the United States \u2014 it would be completely legal and acceptable. And to me, that should be unacceptable. The notion that American corporations are not allowed to buy foreign politicians \u2014 but foreign corporations can buy American politicians \u2014 I don\u2019t think is where we want to be as a country. I\u2019m proposing [a] legislative solution that creates similar barriers to hiring the family members of politicians in the United States.\u201d\n\nWithout identifying specific persons, Schweizer revealed that he had discussed the aforementioned legislative proposal with some senators.\n\n\u201cI recognize it\u2019s not going to be easy to get passed,\u201d said Schweizer of the Washington Corrupt Practices Act. \u201cYou\u2019ve people on both sides of the aisle that want to cash in, but I think this is key, or we\u2019re going to continue to see in this country a descent into more corruption, into kind of a third-world swamp where the political class is getting rich and their interests are not aligned with the populace; their interests are aligned with foreign oligarchs or companies that are paying them.\u201d\n\nSchweizer went on, \u201cAt a very minimum \u2026 there ought to be a disclosure. \u2026 If Joe Biden or Mitch McConnell are running for office, they\u2019re required to disclose a $200 donation from anybody. It\u2019s required by federal law, and the reason is we want to know who\u2019s putting money in their campaign coffers if that person is getting favorable treatment or influence. And they\u2019re also required to disclose if they have $1000 in stock in General Electric, because we want to make sure their decisions are not being marred by their own financial interests. So they have to disclose those things. But their adult child, like Hunter Biden, joins a Chinese firm \u2014 a billion-dollar firm funded by the Chinese government \u2014 there\u2019s no disclosure requirement.\u201d\n\nExisting disclosure requirements related to campaign contributions and investment are insufficient to reveal potential conflicts of interest between politicians and foreign states, noted Schweizer. \u201cI would argue that if you are a foreign entity, the best way to get influence over an American politician is not by making a $200 campaign contribution, it\u2019s not by hoping they own $1000 of your stock, it\u2019s by striking a lucrative deal with one of their kids, and yet there\u2019s no disclosure requirement. At a minimum, we should require American politicians [and] elected officials in senior government positions [to disclose] if their immediate family members have deals with foreign governments. They should be required to disclose that and let citizens know that.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Corrupt Practices Act may yield bipartisan support, speculated Schweizer.\n\n\u201cThis has the prospect of a kind of populist left-right legislative approach,\u201d Schweizer estimated. \u201cImagine if you could have a Ted Cruz, [a] conservative Republican, and an [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez], who is really a left-wing socialist in Congress, both of them [support this]. This is the sort of issue I think resonates with them and their view of Washington. They\u2019re suspicious of the establishment. They see this as corrupt and I\u2019m hoping that we can find common cause.\u201d\n\nSchweizer added, \u201cThat\u2019s what happened with the Stock Act. You had conservative Republicans in the Freedom Caucus [and] left-wing Democrats in New York who all said, \u2018It\u2019s outrageous. They shouldn\u2019t be trading stock in this way. We need to place some restrictions on it.\u2019 I think this has the same marker. The biggest challenge you\u2019re going to have is with leadership. Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell, they\u2019ve been there for a long time. They like to set aside these kinds of perks for themselves. They don\u2019t like to place restrictions on fellow members of Congress. I think you have reform-minded people in both parties, and I just think they need to have the courage to step up and say, \u2018You know what? We need to have a legislative solution to this,\u2019 and I think it\u2019s going to be very hard for the leadership to resist a move, because these are not issues where you\u2019re going to find even five percent of the American people who think this is a good idea. Most Democrats and most Republicans think this is terrible and needs to stop.\u201d\n\nOlsen concluded, \u201cSounds to me like the one thing Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and President Trump could all agree on.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.", "description": "Disclosure of financial ties between politicians' family members and foreign states would combat corruption, determined\u00a0Peter Schweizer.", "authors": ["Robert Kraychik"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/joe-biden-hunter-biden-mitch-mcconnell-elaine-chao-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
