Scott Applewhite/AP Photo white house Schiff threatens to sue over secret whistleblower complaint\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on Thursday threatened legal action against the Trump administration over its refusal to turn over a whistleblower complaint that reportedly involves President Donald Trump\u2019s interactions with a foreign leader.\n\nThe intelligence community\u2019s top watchdog refused on Thursday to share details with the panel about the whistleblower complaint, according to multiple lawmakers who attended the classified briefing, which the director of national intelligence has been withholding from Congress.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire\u2019s refusal to turn over the complaint to the panel prompted Schiff to threaten to go to court or even withhold funding from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Schiff issued a subpoena last week for the complaint, which reportedly involves a \u201cpromise\u201d that President Donald Trump made to a foreign leader.\n\nSchiff accused the White House and Justice Department of intervening to prevent Maguire from sharing the complaint with Congress, and suggested that the House could go to court to obtain it.\n\n\u201cSomeone is trying to manipulate the system,\u201d Schiff told reporters after the briefing, adding that the Justice Department is not providing an explanation about why it recommended withholding the whistleblower complaint from lawmakers. \u201cThere is no privilege that covers whether the White House is involved in trying to stifle a whistleblower complaint.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nSchiff added that he hoped a judge would recognize the urgency of the matter and quickly rule in the House\u2019s favor.\n\nMichael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, did not confirm the rough outlines of the complaint, or that it involves the president, according to lawmakers. Schiff previously said Atkinson deemed the complaint \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nAtkinson may be prohibited by law from sharing details of the complaint with the committee, because Maguire has thus far refused to turn it over. Maguire is required by law to transmit whistleblower complaints to the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump dismissed the reports, writing on Twitter: \u201cVirtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!\u201d He called the issue \u201canother Fake News story.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially \u2018heavily populated\u2019 call,\u201d he asked. \u201cI would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never ends!\u201d Trump wrote, complaining in another tweet that the explosive allegations were yet another example of \u201cPresidential Harassment!\u201d\n\nThe contents of the complaint were shrouded in secrecy from lawmakers and the public alike until Wednesday evening. The Washington Post first reported new details about the complaint in question, notably that it centered on the president\u2019s communications with a foreign leader and that it stemmed from a phone call. According to the Post, the call included a \u201cpromise\u201d that was concerning enough to file an official complaint.\n\nThe whistleblower is being represented by Andrew P. Bakaj, a former CIA officer and managing partner at the Compass Ross Legal Group, a national security law firm.\n\nBakaj, who formerly worked as a lawyer in the CIA Office of the Inspector General, declined to comment on his client or the Post\u2019s story. Others familiar with the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, however, confirmed its broad outlines and that it involves the president\u2019s communications.\n\nAccording to Schiff, Maguire intervened to block the documents from being transmitted to lawmakers, diverting the complaint to the Justice Department and telling the committee that would refuse to share it because it involved someone outside the intelligence community and might involve matters of confidentiality and privilege.\n\nMaguire\u2019s general counsel insisted in a letter to Schiff earlier this week that the Maguire had followed the letter of the law in blocking the transmission of the complaint, arguing that the whistleblower statute governing his agency only applies when the complaint involves a member of the intelligence community. Maguire is set to testify before the Intelligence Committee next Thursday.\n\nWednesday\u2019s reports were also the first time Trump\u2019s involvement has been disclosed in what could blossom into a major political controversy. In his letter to Maguire this week, Schiff accused the intelligence chief of withholding the complaint in order to protect the president.\n\nThe allegations are likely to further strain what is already an extremely tenuous relationship between the president and the intelligence community.\n\nMost glaringly, Trump has publicly and repeatedly cast doubt on the intelligence community\u2019s findings of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Earlier this summer he responded to reports that the CIA had tried to recruit North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s brother as an informant by announcing his opposition to such a plan. In 2017, the president is said to have revealed classified intelligence regarding U.S. operations in Syria to Russian diplomats during a meeting in the Oval Office.\n\nThe president has long sparred publicly with former intelligence community officials who served under President Barack Obama, including former FBI Director James Comey, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan.\n\nIt is unclear which foreign leader Trump had been speaking to when he allegedly made the troubling promise, but the Post report notes that in the preceding five weeks before the whistleblower lodged his or her complaint, White House records showed communications between Trump and five world leaders. That list includes Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Trump spoke on the phone at the end of July. He also met with several foreign leaders at the White House and said he had received multiple letters from North Korea\u2019s Kim.\n\nBlake Hounshell contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "The intelligence community inspector general deemed the complaint \u201curgent\u201d and credible.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney", "Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/be/e1/b3026a914fe88cbdb7c4e349abc5/190919-schiff-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
