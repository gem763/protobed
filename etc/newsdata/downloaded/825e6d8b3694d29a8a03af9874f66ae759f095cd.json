We can get hot. I think everyone believes that, so it\u2019s just a matter of going out there and doing it.\u201d\n\nNew York pulled within four games of Chicago and Milwaukee for the second NL wild-card berth. The Mets have 11 games left in the regular season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to grab as many games as we possibly can,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cEvery win matters and we\u2019re going to keep trying to play our best baseball coming down the stretch.\u201d\n\nStroman (9-13) allowed four hits, struck out seven and walked one in helping the Mets bounce back from consecutive losses.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t solve him today,\u201d said Charlie Blackmon, who homered off Luis Avilan with two outs in the ninth for the Rockies\u2019 lone run. \u201cGood movement on his pitches in the hitting area, that\u2019s what I saw from the side. Fastball had a little bit of takeoff, had some run. Had a hard cutter. Mixed in some breaking balls. We just didn\u2019t square many balls up.\u201d\n\nTim Melville (2-3) had put up zeroes right along with Stroman, facing the minimum through five innings with an assist from his defense, which turned three double plays while he was on the mound.\n\nBut Todd Frazier singled to start the sixth and Rosario followed by driving a 1-1 offering from Melville into the left field bleachers for his 13th home run and a 2-0 lead.\n\nOne out later, Nimmo tagged the first pitch he saw for his seventh of the season. Melville got Jeff McNeil to fly out before Alonso, getting the green light on a 3-0 pitch, connected for his 48th home run. The ball landed among the stand of evergreens beyond the center field fence, and Melville was relieved by Philip Diehl.\n\n\u201cI feel like a lot of us were taking really good swings,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cUnfortunately, in the game of baseball, it\u2019s nine against one and sometimes you hit them right at people. You hit the ball hard and it doesn\u2019t necessarily show up in the results. But I feel like we were having quality at-bats and it all eventually came together. That sixth inning was nice, really nice.\u201d\n\nAlonso, who added an RBI single in the Mets\u2019 eighth, is one homer shy of tying Mark McGwire for the second-most home runs by a rookie in a season. The New York Yankees\u2019 Aaron Judge hit 52 home runs as a rookie in 2017.\n\nStroman, acquired from Toronto in a July 28 trade, improved to 3-2 with a 3.86 ERA in his nine starts for New York. The Mets have gone 6-3 with Stroman on the mound.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS AND THANKS\n\nFormer Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan, a two-time Super Bowl winner, was in attendance and offered his congratulations to Alonso, leaning across a railing near the visitors dugout to deliver some encouraging words to the Mets standout rookie as he rejoined his team after hitting his sixth-inning homer.\n\n\u201cHe just shook my hand,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Mike Shanahan.\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, I know.\u2019 My dad raised me right. My dad is a big football guy. He grew up playing football, played college football and when I was playing football he made sure I knew who certain people were and he was definitely one of those guys. He just said, \u2018Good swing. It\u2019s fun watching you play. Keep doing it.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Thanks.\u2019\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland threw some 40 pitches in a simulated game in a major step toward returning from a left groin strain. The team remains hopeful he\u2019ll be able to pitch one or two more times before the end of this season. Freeland said he felt fine after the throwing session. \u201cAll pitches felt good,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cLeg held up well, so was able to go 100 percent. All in all, it felt really good today.\u201d Freeland has been on the 10-day injured list since Aug. 21.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMets: RHP Noah Syndergaard (10-8, 4.15 ERA) is slated to make his first career start against Colorado at Coors Field. He has gone 2-0 with a 2.42 ERA in four previous starts against Colorado, all at home.\n\nRockies: RHP Jeff Hoffman (2-6, 7.03 ERA) is making his second start of the season against the Mets. He took the loss in the first encounter on June 9, allowing six hits and seven runs in 4 2/3 innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Marcus Stroman provided a boost to the New York Mets' flickering playoff hopes.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Georgatos"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/mets_rockies_baseball_27319_c0-241-4773-3023_s1770x1032.jpg?fbd83072b660fa623adf84ead836056196f32e9e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
