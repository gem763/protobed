And they can apply for a Tesco Bank credit card with no foreign exchange fees.\n\nTesco said Clubcard Plus holders could save more than \u00a3400 a year.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays said Clubcard Plus should theoretically appeal to many shoppers. \u201cIn practice it\u2019s hard to judge the deterrent effect of the monthly fee, but early membership numbers from Casino\u2019s (CASP.PA) similar French scheme seem promising,\u201d they said.\n\nThey estimate Clubcard Plus could deliver a 2.5 percentage point sales boost, but said the impact on profit is harder to judge.\n\nTesco\u2019s biggest rival Sainsbury\u2019s recently overhauled its no-fee Nectar scheme, allowing shoppers to boost loyalty points by pre-selecting offers on certain products.\n\nClothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) also plans to re-launch its underperforming Sparks programme.\n\nDiscounters, which focus on low prices, regard loyalty programmes as a costly waste of time and have used their advertising to lampoon previous schemes as over-complicated.\n\nBut the Barclays analysts said the fact that mainstream grocers have re-committed to their schemes, despite paring back unproductive costs in other areas in recent years, suggests they pay off through higher sales and valuable consumer data.\n\nEarlier this month Tesco said its CEO Dave Lewis will step down next summer after six years in the job.", "description": "Tesco will next week become the first major British supermarket group to offer a subscription customer loyalty scheme, the latest weapon in its fight to stem the market share gains of German-owned discounters.", "authors": ["James Davey", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446195757&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S122", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
