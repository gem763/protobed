See below for this week\u2019s Callout Collection \u2013 and just how realistic each one is.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFirst up, let\u2019s take a look at the night\u2019s prelim winners.\n\nJi Yeon Kim\n\nWants to fight: Alexa Grasso\n\nThe callout: \u201cI want to fight Alexa Grasso on the upcoming Busan event in December. I want to fight her and make my way up the division.\u201d\n\nThe reality: Ji Yeon Kim (9-2-2 MMA, 3-2 UFC) is hoping to return to action on Dec. 21 to compete at UFC on ESPN+ 23 in her native South Korea, and she\u2019s got an opponent in mind in Mexican striker Grasso (11-3 MMA, 3-3 UFC).\n\nStylistically, it\u2019s a perfect fight for \u201cFirefist.\u201d Like Kim, Grasso prefers to stand and bang. Grasso might also potentially be motivated to fight again soon after losing a close decision to former champ Carla Esparza in September.\n\nRankings-wise, it might not be an instant homerun, with Grasso a little further up the table at No. 13 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMA Junkie MMA strawweight rankings and Kim currently unranked. But Grasso\u2019s hope for a rebound, not to mention a chance to compete on the opposite side of the globe, might provide her the motivation she needs to take what would certainly be an exciting, fan-friendly contest.\n\nJake Matthews\n\nWants to fight: Carlos Condit\n\nThe callout: \u201cI asked for Carlos Condit this fight, but I know he\u2019s fighting Mickey Gall next. So once Carlos is done smashing Mickey, I\u2019d like to have that legend fight.\u201d\n\nThe reality: Jake Matthews(15-4 MMA, 8-4 UFC) is still just 25 years old despite already boasting 12 UFC appearances, and while his win at UFC 243 wasn\u2019t exactly thrilling, it was technically sound. But as \u201cThe Celtic Kid\u201d continues to develop, it\u2019s clear he could use an aggressive dance partner to keep things exciting.\n\nEnter Condit (30-13 MMA, 9-7 UFC).\n\nOf course, despite Matthews\u2019 confident, Condit doesn\u2019t exactly have a gimme opponent in his next outing, so \u201cThe Natural Born Killer\u201d may not seem quite as enticing of an opponent after his December meeting with Gall. Not to mention, that fight isn\u2019t for another two months, so that would leave Matthews on the sidelines for quite some time.\n\nIn short, it doesn\u2019t really seem to make a whole lot of sense to me at this exact moment, but I do like seeing a 25-year-old kid willing to call out the name of a long-established star like Condit.\n\nNext up, let\u2019s check out the main card.", "description": "City Kickboxing teammates Israel Adesanya and Dan Hooker were among those with specific names in mind for their next fight after UFC 243.", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/israel-adesanya-ufc-243-post-fight-belt-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
