But on Saturday the Baltimore Orioles reached 100 losses for the second straight year.\n\nThe pitching staff set a record for the most home runs allowed in a season before the calendar even turned to September. The offense is only mustering 4.4 runs per game through Sunday and a former home run king became a punchline with a .172 batting average.\n\nThe turmoil and bad memories aren\u2019t contained to just the field, either.\n\nIn August, a pair of dugout spats were caught on camera: frustrated, slumping first baseman Chris Davis getting in the face of manager Brandon Hyde, then relief pitcher Richard Bleier arguing with third base coach Jos\u00e9 David Fl\u00f3res weeks later. Meanwhile, the front office let go of 25 baseball operations employees in a span of three weeks, the most recent coming last week.\n\nThe casual observer might think the Orioles are unraveling. But those who follow the storied franchise understand that Baltimore is the latest professional sports team to embrace the pain of losing big now in hopes of bouncing back big later.\n\nFor now, Orioles management, led by general manager Mike Elias and his handpicked executive team, ask players and fans to \u201ctrust the process.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy \u2014 not when the losses pile up into triple digits in consecutive years \u2014 but Orioles players are trying to keep their heads held high as they look to the future.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got to try and keep some perspective of what we\u2019re trying to do and why it makes sense for the future, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier for the guys that are actually out there, currently fighting,\u201d designated hitter Mark Trumbo said. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s got personal goals that they\u2019re working towards, and even though the team win-and-loss record is not what you want it to be, you\u2019re still fighting for your own career and to support your family.\u201d\n\n\u2018Excited about the direction\u2019\n\nElias arrived in Baltimore in November after helping the Houston Astros rebuild from the worst team in Major League Baseball into a World Series champion. His strategy to turn the Orioles around is the same. Elias told The Washington Times in July that the Orioles have no choice but to \u201cgo through some lean years\u201d to get better.\n\nHe was hired after the Orioles posted the worst record in franchise history last year, 47-115. They actually began Elias\u2019 job for him by trading away several of their best players \u2014 Manny Machado, Zach Britton, Jonathan Schoop \u2014 and not re-signing aging fan favorite Adam Jones after the season.\n\nIn that process, the Orioles acquired new prospects to stock up their farm system. Losing at a historic rate also earned them the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2019, which they used it on catcher Adley Rutschman. He played well at the Low-A level after the draft and could get some action in the mid-level minor leagues next year.\n\nElias touted the rebuilt farm system with his first season as general manager winding down. But what other positives could he point to besides a crop of prospects who won\u2019t help the Orioles for a few seasons?\n\n\u201cWell look, it\u2019s not the record at the big-league level,\u201d Elias said. \u201cI think we all know that and we\u2019re disappointed by it. But more important than that right now is some of the individual development we\u2019ve seen in some of our young players \u2026 There are several players that could be a meaningful part of our playoff future, and that\u2019s here at the major-league level, not just in the minors.\u201d\n\nThose include infielder Hanser Alberto, who hits for average and plays good defense, and outfielder Anthony Santander, who\u2019s risen to the occasion to win an everyday job in Baltimore.\n\nElias also wasn\u2019t concerned the midseason dismissals from baseball ops would hurt morale within the organization, calling this time of year \u201ccontract season\u201d in the baseball world.\n\n\u201cPeople expect change in this business,\u201d Elias said. \u201cI think that they expect change in the circumstance. I think the people that are here going forward with us, they take that as a vote of confidence. I think they\u2019re excited about the direction, especially the emphasis that we\u2019re gonna have on scouting and player development going forward.\u201d\n\nPlaying for the future\n\nThe players themselves aren\u2019t \u201ctanking.\u201d But the team as it was constructed this year didn\u2019t have the talent to compete with the division rival New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays and Boston Red Sox.\n\nRight fielder, first baseman and clubhouse leader Trey Mancini helps his teammates separate what happens at the field from their time off.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re at the field we\u2019re very serious and take our jobs seriously, but when the game\u2019s over and we go home, a lot of us hang out with each other off the field and just go out to dinner or whatever we do,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cWe usually don\u2019t talk about baseball too much away from the field. Everybody has a life outside of this, too. I think it\u2019s healthy to kind of, whenever you\u2019re away from the field, to just live your other life.\u201d\n\nThat notion \u2014 essentially, not taking work home with you \u2014 was a theme around the clubhouse.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re at the highest level. Everyone\u2019s watching you. To take that pressure home, it\u2019s not gonna be healthy for you,\u201d outfielder DJ Stewart said.\n\nThe mood in Baltimore\u2019s clubhouse before games isn\u2019t somber. A few players play chess or table tennis while others chat at their stalls. At a recent road game, Stewart showed some public relations staffers some card tricks, though he doesn\u2019t count magic as a hobby.\n\nOthers have different diversions when they get home from a game. Trumbo and his wife are caring for their first child, a nine-month-old daughter named Morgan.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s taken up almost all of my time, which, you know, it\u2019s kind of a nice distraction from some of the other stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI have hobbies and other things. I usually take a trip right after the season. I\u2019ve kind of recommended that to some other guys. Go somewhere kind of far away, completely different. That\u2019s a good way to maybe reflect a little bit, but also get totally away from the high-stress environment\u201d of professional baseball.\n\nMychal Givens finds purpose doing community work. The Orioles recently recognized the pitcher with the Orioles Way Award for the work he does with his Givens Back Foundation, which uses sports to reach out to kids in inner-city communities.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on the field and off the field, you separate it,\u201d Givens said. \u201cWhen I do my community stuff off the field, it\u2019s my (space). And when I\u2019m in here I\u2019m gonna contribute to helping the team in whatever the best way I can do possible.\n\n\u201cAs a baseball player, I\u2019m just using my platform to kids and I\u2019ve been helping them my whole entire life.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Stewart said it\u2019s helpful to remember that the team\u2019s outlook won\u2019t change overnight.\n\n\u201cWe know what it is right now and no one likes losing,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut I think we all have that mindset of working hard every single day and knowing that it\u2019s not gonna happen right now, but in the future if we continue to do what we\u2019re supposed to do and continue to get better every day, we\u2019ll be rewarded in the end.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
