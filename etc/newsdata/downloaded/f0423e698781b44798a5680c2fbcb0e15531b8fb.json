So what's his deal? Since 2016, the Nova Scotia artist has been releasing short films with bonkers alliterative titles: \"Wizardly Wickedly Weeping,\" \"Humanity Hyuck Hyuck.\" And right now, the plan is to check off every letter of the alphabet, even if it takes the next few decades to hit all 26. (To date, he's finished four.)\n\nClips from two of his shorts are appearing on this week's episode of CBC Arts: Exhibitionists. The first, \"Billy's Behemoth Blast,\" won the Best Atlantic Animation prize at 2018's FIN Atlantic International Film Festival. Based on a bit of Owen family lore, it's an almost psychedelic throwback to the Halifax Explosion. The second, \"Ghoulish Galactic Grievances,\" is a live-action sci-fi adventure made with old-school effects (including stop-motion by Tim Tracey) \"about friendship and the guilt of following your dreams.\" In style and story, they couldn't be more different \u2014 except for those titles.\n\nBilly's Behemoth Blast is based on the story of Owen's grandfather, who was six months old when he survived the Halifax Explosion. (Courtesy of the Josh Owen)\n\nSo, why's he doing it?\n\n\"It's more of like a coinkydink kind of thing that this happened,\" says Owen over the phone from the west coast, where \"GGG\" just played the Vancouver International Film Festival. (It hits Montreal's Festival du nouveau cin\u00e9ma next, playing Oct. 12 and Oct. 18.)\n\nThe first one was \"Humanity Hyuck Hyuck,\" which he made while doing a screen arts program back home in Dartmouth, N.S. That title was more influenced by a lifetime of playing Donkey Kong Country than any long-term creative strategy, he explains. For the uninitiated: \"Every level of the game has an alliterative name,\" he explains. But he saw potential in keeping up the shtick.\n\n\"The story of the movie is more important than, like, oh, it's [named after] the letter A. I make the movies and figure the title out after.\"\n\n\"But I've enjoyed doing it because I think it gets people interested in your body of work as opposed to hearing about one film.\"\n\nPlus, it just keeps him busy, and as an emerging artist (Owen's 24), he says every new project is really a chance to learn the ABCs of filmmaking. Right now, in fact, he's working on two more. They'll be \"direct sequels\" to \"BBB,\" he explains \u2014 animated shorts inspired by his granddad.\n\nAnd they'll be brought to you by the letters C and D.\n\nWatch now!
