Carteris won last month\u2019s guild election by a significant margin, earning 44% of the vote with 13,537 votes. Modine received 10,682 votes, with 5,048 for Jane Austin; 1,096 for Queen Alljahye Searles and 367 for Abraham Justice.\n\nNelson\u2019s complaints were initially sent to SAG-AFTRA\u2019s national election committee, along with those from 13 other union members; but all protests were dismissed. Now, making good on threats of Labor Department appeals made during the election, several supporters of Modine and the Membership First slate are turning to Labor Sec. Eugene Scalia and Los Angeles federal labor investigator Troy Krouse for possible redress.\n\nAlso Read: Gabrielle Carteris, Matthew Modine Intensify Attacks in New SAG-AFTRA Election Videos\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening that in light of these blatant election violations, the SAG-AFTRA Committee has chosen to turn a blind eye to this impropriety and instead serve as a rubber stamp on the incumbent Ms. Carteris\u2019 malfeasance,\u201d read a statement from Nelson via his attorney, Robert Allen.\n\n\u201cThe Union is in dire need of new leadership and a thorough review by the OLMS [Office of Labor-Management Standards] to ensure that it is once again run for the benefit of its members.\u201d\n\nIn the complaint, Nelson alleges that Carteris violated Title IV by appearing in an episode of \u201cBH90210\u201d aired during the election period in which she plays the head of a fictional actors\u2019 union. The complaint calls the episode a \u201cblatant national commercial,\u201d a description that echoes a nearly identical complaint filed by SAG-AFTRA Los Angeles board member Brian Hamilton last week.\n\nAlso Read: How Hollywood's Guilds Are Bracing for Crucial Negotiations in 2020\n\nNelson also echoes previous federal complaints by claiming that Carteris used her status as incumbent president to add the guild\u2019s recent deal with Netflix to her campaign statement, even though the deal was still confidential at the time campaign statements were due and was not officially announced until three weeks later.\n\nBut Nelson goes beyond Hamilton\u2019s complaint, bringing up a video loop screened in the guild\u2019s common areas during the election that he claims \u201cpredominantly\u201d featured Carteris and actors that were running alongside her as part of the Unite For Strength slate. The complaint argues that the guild\u2019s board used \u201cillogical reasoning\u201d and did not perform \u201cany substantive investigation\u201d when rejecting his protest, saying that it didn\u2019t take into account the \u201ctone, timing, and content\u201d of the video.\n\nAlso Read: Matthew Modine's SAG-AFTRA Campaign Rep Apologizes for Retweeting Threat to 'Get Rid of' Gabrielle Carteris\n\n\u201cThe union\u2019s incumbent president, Ms. Carteris, is excessively featured in the loop of videos, while her opponent and members of her opponent\u2019s party are categorically excluded from the videos, even though they are union officers, board members and representatives who were engaged during that same period in newsworthy union events.\u201d\n\nThe complaints filed could lead to the Department of Labor to invalidate the election and force the guild to conduct a new one. In 2002, the Screen Actors Guild was forced to run a new election between incumbent Melissa Gilbert and challenger Valerie Harper after complaints were filed by the latter over the guild\u2019s voting systems. The re-run resulted in no changes as Gilbert was re-elected.\n\nCarteris and SAG-AFTRA did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead original story Matthew Modine\u2019s Campaign Manager Files Federal Complaint Over SAG-AFTRA Election At TheWrap", "description": "Adam Nelson, campaign manager for Matthew Modine in his failed bid for SAG-AFTRA President, filed a federal complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor alleging multiple labor code violations by guild president Gabrielle Carteris.The complaint accuses Carteris and her campaign of more than a dozen violations", "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/o.UgQULil_IaT4wB3_pF7g--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/ea4fe58e7c94204d18033f9006ed1476", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
