The details that came out in the Harvard case \u2014 along with the FBI\u2019s Operation Varsity Blues \u2014 will not be forgotten.\n\nColleges can expect more scrutiny over questions of their interpretation of regression scores, preference for athletes, and the influence of donors and legacy admissions. College leaders and higher education policymakers should be thinking about how they can evolve and improve their affirmative action policies. One key way to start is by looking abroad.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the United States, we often debate affirmative action as if this is the only country where these policies have been tried. In fact, many other countries have created systems and formulas to try to increase racial, ethnic and gender participation in schools, the workplace and government. Some of these policies predate the U.S. experiment by more than a century and can teach us about entrenched inequities.\n\nFor example, the largest nationally sponsored affirmative action program was established in India under British colonial rule in the late 19th century. India\u2019s caste system had historically prohibited members of the Dalit, the \u201cuntouchable\u201d castes, from going to school and moving into decent employment.\n\nThe affirmative action program, termed the \u201creservation\u201d system, transformed life for many in the lower caste groups in India.\n\nAs recently as 1965, Dalits held just 1.6 percent of the most senior civil service positions. Currently, Dalits\u2019 share rose to an estimated 11 percent, nearly identical to the Dalits\u2019 representation in the Indian population. Dalits now have a chamber of commerce representing their interests and more than 80 members in the lower house of parliament.\n\nThe effects of this reservation system by caste are continually felt in education in today\u2019s India. Like in the United States, India\u2019s quota system has faced considerable political pushback. However, even so, 22.5 percent of all places in educational institutions that have complete or partial government funding remain reserved for caste and tribal youth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecent research has found that India\u2019s reservation policy, when applied to India\u2019s most prestigious universities, led to a three-fold increase in enrollment among the disadvantaged groups.\n\nNumerous other countries \u2014 including post-apartheid South Africa, Brazil, Bulgaria, China and France, just to name a few \u2014 have put into place one or another kind of affirmative action policy with quota systems in education that directly address historical discrimination. Using educational remedies to help address social injustice is not unique to the United States.\n\nWhile the U.S. has never had a formal quota system in education, the effects of systemic racism have in many ways created a de-facto caste system that predates the founding of the country and still affects the everyday lives of millions. It\u2019s time to try something new that explicitly acknowledges that basic truth.\n\nIf we take a lesson from India and these other countries, we could start to build a system that proactively increases equity in higher education. It could be a major step toward creating a more diverse, representative, fair and prosperous society for everyone.\n\nDaniel A.
