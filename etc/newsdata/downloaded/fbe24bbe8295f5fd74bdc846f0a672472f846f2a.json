Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply,\" Pompeo tweeted. \"There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\"\n\nThe White House condemned the attacks and said President Donald Trump spoke with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to offer U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's defense.\n\n\"Violent actions against civilian areas and infrastructure vital to the global economy only deepen conflict and mistrust. The United States Government is monitoring the situation and remains committed to ensuring global oil markets are stable and well supplied,\" the White House said.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks, which reportedly created a huge fire at a processor essential to global energy supplies. The Saudi interior ministry said the fires were under control and that investigations into the terrorist attack are ongoing.\n\nThe drones attacked Hijra Khurais, one of Saudi Arabia's largest oil fields, and Abqaiq, the world's biggest crude stabilization facility.\n\n\"We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks,\" Pompeo said. \"The United States will work with our partners and allies to ensure that energy markets remain well supplied and Iran is held accountable for its aggression.\"", "description": "Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks, which created a huge fire at a processor essential to global energy supplies.", "authors": ["Emma Newburger"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106129895-1568483991848rtx72w12.jpg?v=1568484892", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
