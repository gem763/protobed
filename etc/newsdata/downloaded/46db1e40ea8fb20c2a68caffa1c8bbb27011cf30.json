The Cardinals\u2019 bats struggled this season and St. Louis\u2019s offense was, by some metrics, the worst to qualify for baseball\u2019s postseason. The Atlanta Braves further exposed holes in the Cardinals\u2019 lineup during a 3-0 win in Game 2 of the NLDS, throwing just 12 four-seam fastballs in 116 total pitches. The Nationals could exploit this potential weakness with Stephen Strasburg\u2019s curveball, Patrick Corbin\u2019s slider and, more pressingly, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s array of off-speed weapons.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 offense is built around putting the ball in play, and that\u2019ll be a dynamic to watch against a pitcher like Mikolas, who throws to contact and still has shown an ability to escape. Last season, in his first year back in MLB, he allowed an NL-leading 183 hits and turned in a 2.84 ERA. This season has been tougher, with a 4.16 ERA, but he\u2019s showed progress in the postseason and delivered five innings of one-run ball in Game 1 against a difficult Braves lineup. He also threw an inning of scoreless relief in Game 4, which means he threw 10 pitches just four days ago. How that affects a possible pitch count in Game 1 of the NLCS is unclear, but it\u2019s something the Nationals might try to exploit with long at-bats to dig into a solid bullpen early in the series.\n\nPregame reading\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNLCS preview: Nationals\u2019 new kids on the block meet the Cardinals\u2019 old guard.

From the eighth-inning rally to the starter-in-relief to the date when the games finished, the Nationals appear to be channeling the 1924 Senators, and it\u2019s getting spooky.
