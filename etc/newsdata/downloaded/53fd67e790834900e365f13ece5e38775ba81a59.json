The Mariners are giving several young players a look to finish the season, which has them ranked 17th in wRC+ alongside a top-ten strikeout rate (24.4%) over the past 30 days. In other words, I\u2019m not intimidated by the Seattle lineup, and Gray shouldn\u2019t be either. The Cincinnati righty has been fantastic over the last month, allowing just five earned runs across 42.2 innings in his last seven starts. He has a good chance at earning a road victory tonight, as the Reds should be able to post some runs against the recent struggles of Seattle LHP Marco Gonzales.\n\nAlso Consider: Stephen Strasburgh, Chris Paddack\n\nCATCHER / FIRST BASE\n\nMitch Moreland - Boston (at Toronto)\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreland is cheap despite swinging a confident bat with six hits, one homer, and four RBIs over his last four starts. Tonight\u2019s matchup falls into his wheelhouse, facing Toronto RHP Tren Thornton\u2019s .357 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Boston checks in with a top-five scoring projection on this expanded slate, and Moreland is a solid lift within that.\n\nAlso Consider: Paul Goldschmidt, Daniel Murphy\n\nSECOND BASE\n\nKolten Wong - St. Louis (at Colorado)\n\nThe Cardinals were unable to cash in on a strong matchup at Coors Field yesterday, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore them tonight. St. Louis represents the highest scoring projection yet again, and it\u2019s not even close. Facing Colorado RHP Antonio Senzatela (.354 wOBA vs. LHB) gives them a good shot at redemption, and I\u2019ll be looking to building a Cards\u2019 stack through all formats.\n\nAlso Consider: Ryan McMahon, Brian Dozier\n\nTHIRD BASE\n\nYoan Moncada - Chicago White Sox (vs. Kansas City)\n\nYou have to love the switch-hitting third baseman tonight, as the matchup aligns perfectly while facing Kansas City RHP Glenn Sparkman\u2019s .375 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Moncada holds a reasonably mid-range salary despite recording multiple hits in five of his last six. I\u2019d be surprised if that hot streak was extinguished tonight.\n\nAlso consider: Abraham Toro, Joey Wendle\n\nSHORTSTOP\n\nPaul DeJong - St. Louis (at Colorado)\n\nHere we go with another St. Louis recommendation, as DeJong stands to enjoy the hitting utopia of Coors Field. You could also look towards top-notch shortstops like Alex Bregman or Trea Turner, but DeJong tends to carry a shorter salary while arguably looking at a better situation. The Cards\u2019 infielder entered this series with some wind in his sails after smacking two homers with five RBIs over his past five games. It\u2019s time for him to rekindle that upside tonight.\n\nAlso Consider: Alex Bregman, Trea Turner\n\nOUTFIELD\n\nFranmil Reyes - Cleveland (at LA Angels)\n\nReyes was listed in this spot yesterday, and he came through with a 1-2 performance with a double, walk, and four RBIs. He\u2019ll enjoy the platoon advantage yet again, facing LAA LHP Dillon Peters (.378 wOBA vs. RHB). Reyes has flexed promising upside over the past few weeks, and it\u2019s time to invest in him while the bat remains hot.\n\nShohei Ohtani - LA Angels (vs. Cleveland)\n\nLet\u2019s look to the other side of the same game, where Ohtani is another high-upside candidate with a bargain salary. The matchup certainly plays to his favor while stepping in against Cleveland RHP Adam Plutko\u2019s .384 wOBA split to left-handed bats. Go ahead and keep Ohtani in DFS consideration through all formats.\n\nAlso consider: Aristides Aquino, A.J. Pollock, Dexter Fowler, Tommy Edman, Yasiel Puig, Victor Robles, Andrew Benintendi, Chris Taylor, Matt Joyce", "description": "Spencer Limbach runs through the best MLB DFS Plays for Wednesday, September 11.
