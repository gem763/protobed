Authorities have been working to rebuild the region, about 240km north of Tokyo, although areas near the crippled plant remain uninhabitable because of radiation dangers.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "Japan has announced for the first time that a worker at the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant has died after being exposed to radiation, Japanese media reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2141/d75767706002413aa0f5e6442069aa52.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-06"}
