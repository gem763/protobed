It\u2019s completely inadmissible. So, of course, we will not allow that,\u201d Alexander Lavrentyev, Russia\u2019s special presidential envoy for Syria, told reporters in the United Arab Emirates, according to the Interfax news agency.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nRussia\u2019s announcement came as the United States said Tuesday that it has removed its own troops from Manbij. \u201cCoalition forces are executing a deliberate withdrawal from northeast Syria,\u201d Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a U.S. military spokesman, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are out of Manbij.\u201d\n\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Russian and Syrian national flags flutter on military vehicles near Manbij, Syria Oct. 15, 2019. \u00a9 Omar Sanadiki/Reuters\n\nThe Syrian Kurds announced Monday that they had struck an agreement with the government of President Bashar al-Assad aimed at blunting a nearly week-long Turkish government offensive into Kurdish-held territory in northern Syria.\n\nThe deal would allow Syrian government forces to take over security in some border areas, according to Syrian Kurdish officials, who said their administration would maintain control of local institutions.\n\nEarly Tuesday, Syrian state television reported that government troops have entered Manbij. It aired video footage of what it said were residents celebrating the arrival of Syrian forces in the center of town.\n\nAnkara has said its military operation is aimed at clearing the border of Syrian Kurdish forces with links to Kurdish militants inside Turkey and repatriating Syrian refugees to the country.\n\nThe United States and other Western allies of Turkey have condemned the operation, warning that it could lead to the resurgence of the Islamic State militant group. The Trump administration on Monday called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to implement an immediate cease-fire and imposed sanctions on Turkey\u2019s Defense and Energy ministries, as well as on three senior Turkish officials.\n\nPresident Trump has been harshly criticized, including by some of his own Republican allies, for withdrawing U.S. troops and leaving the U.S.-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to face the Turkish military. Vice President Pence announced Monday that he was leading a delegation to Turkey in the \u201cimmediate future\u201d in an effort to end the violence.\n\nErdogan has given no indication he is willing to halt the offensive. \u201cWe will soon secure the region from Manbij to the border with Iraq,\u201d he said Tuesday during a visit to Azerbaijan, referring to a 230-mile expanse.\n\nTurkey had long demanded that the United States expel the SDF from Manbij and complained that a deal struck with Washington to remove the fighters was not being implemented.\n\nTurkey and the United States agreed in December on a plan for the SDF to withdraw from Manbij, about 25 miles west of the Euphrates River, and a road map envisioned joint U.S.-Turkish patrols in the city. Turkish officials view the Kurdish fighters in Syria as terrorists because of their links to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long war for autonomy inside Turkey.\n\nMoscow, which has friendly ties with both the Syrian and Turkish governments, appeared uniquely positioned to prevent the two militaries from clashing around Manbij and elsewhere in Syria. At the same, Russia has made clear that it opposes Turkey\u2019s military operation. Lavrentyev, Russia\u2019s Syria envoy, said Tuesday that the offensive in Syria was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have never favored and never supported the idea of sending, for instance, Turkish units there, not to mention Syrian armed opposition,\u201d he said, referring to the Turkish-backed rebel groups, according to Interfax.\n\nRussia\u2019s principal interests in Syria include \u201cmounting a successful defense of its Syrian ally in Damascus, restoring Damascus\u2019 writ and sovereignty over the entire territory of Syria, and then additionally reconciling the Syrian government with its regional and international surroundings,\u201d said Sam Heller, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. Russia\u2019s effort to normalize Syria\u2019s relationships have included promoting a 20-year-old agreement between Ankara and Damascus intended to address Turkey\u2019s security concerns \u2014 an accord that could eventually lead to restoring relations between the two governments.\n\nBut Turkey\u2019s plans to control a swath of Syrian territory, for an undetermined period of time, appeared to clash with Russia\u2019s aims. And despite Moscow\u2019s announcement Tuesday of peacekeeping efforts, fighting around Manbij continued, according to several reports.\n\nA Kurdish official said Tuesday that scattered clashes occurred outside Manbij and that artillery fire from Turkey had struck the town. The Turkish-backed Syrian National Army said Tuesday that its forces had \u201cstarted freeing villages\u201d around Manbij a day earlier but had not entered.\n\nTurkey said Tuesday that two of its soldiers were killed and eight others injured as a result of mortar and artillery fire by \u201cterrorists\u201d in Manbij, referring to the SDF.\n\nSyrian government troops were mainly spread around the edges of Manbij, but Kurdish fighters still controlled the town, according to Abu Musafir, a member of the Manbij Tribal Council. The majority of ethnic Arab residents \u201cwere excited about the military operation led by Turkey and the Syrian National Army,\u201d he said, while at the same time worried about the return of the Syrian army.\n\nThe battles across Syria over the past week have taken a withering toll on civilians. The United Nations has said that as many as 160,000 people, including 70,000 children, have been displaced since the fighting in northeastern Syria escalated nearly a week ago. The Kurdish administration said Tuesday that as many as 275,000 internally displaced people are in the region.\n\nThe Kurdish Red Crescent said Monday that international aid groups have pulled their international staff from the northeast, leaving camps for displaced people with \u201cextremely limited support.\u201d\n\nMercy Corps, which had been operating in the area since 2014, said Monday it was suspending operations in northeastern Syria and evacuating international staff.\n\n\u201cThis is our nightmare scenario,\u201d Made Ferguson, the group\u2019s deputy country director for Syria, said in a statement. \u201cThere are tens of thousands of people on the run, and we have no way of getting to them. We\u2019ve had to pull our international staff out of northeast Syria. We just cannot effectively operate with the heavy shelling, roads closing, and the various and constantly changing armed actors in the areas where we are working.\u201d\n\nAcross the border in Iraq on Tuesday, exhausted Syrian Kurds said they had paid smugglers to get them out. Carrying few possessions \u2014 often no more than could be stuffed in a handbag \u2014 they had walked for hours in the darkness before trudging toward checkpoints, looking tired and stunned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent so many years watching the tragedy of the refugees on the news. I never thought I could be one of them,\u201d said Rafat, 45, who arrived Monday at the sunbaked Domiz refugee camp. \u201cMy legs hurt, my calves hurt. We are all exhausted.\u201d\n\nAlthough most had expected the offensive, its speed and scope had come as a shock.\n\n\u201cWe were ready to stay in our houses. We really thought it would settle down,\u201d said Hevin Mohammed Hamcho, 29, who made the journey from the Syrian border town of Ras al-Ayn while eight months pregnant. \u201cWe thought the Americans would protect us, but then they just stepped back so quickly. We trusted them, and that\u2019s left us with nothing.\u201d\n\nOne family, unable to afford the smugglers\u2019 fee, said they had packed onto two motorbikes and driven as fast as they could across the border. \u201cThe Peshmerga were shooting at us,\u201d said Rasheed, 24, referring to the Kurdish security forces in Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe held tight and just kept going,\u201d he said.\n\nkareem.fahim@washpost.com\n\nsarah.dadouch@washpost.com\n\nerin.cunningham@washpost.com\n\nDadouch reported from Beirut.
