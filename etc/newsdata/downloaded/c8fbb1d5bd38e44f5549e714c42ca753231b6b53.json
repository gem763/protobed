My family was really affected. Tears come to my eyes when I remember where we used to go to find food \u2013 in the bins. The company owes me a lot of money which they refuse to pay me.\u201d\n\nAmnesty believes the true scale of the problem is likely to be far bigger, with the US State Department estimating that more than 6,000 workers submitted complaints to Qatar\u2019s new Committees for the Settlement of Labour Disputes last year.\n\nThe Qatari Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs told Amnesty it helped to negotiate many of the settlements and provided food and generators at workers\u2019 camps. None of the three companies investigated responded when presented with Amnesty\u2019s findings.\n\nStephen Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s deputy director of global issues, told the Guardian the report showed that for all Qatar\u2019s promises of labour reform, the rhetoric did not match the reality on the ground.\n\n\u201cDespite the significant promises of reform which Qatar has made ahead of the 2022 World Cup, it remains a playground for unscrupulous employers,\u201d he said. \u201cEither the reforms are being done very slowly, or they are not being implemented properly or they are not being done at all. As a result of that there are still thousands of workers who are not being paid properly, they are not getting justice, or are living in poor conditions.\n\n\u201cWe all know that as big tournaments come and go the wind of change closes a little bit. What is being done for workers is not what is being promised. Promising reform is not actually the same as delivering it.\u201d", "description": "Amnesty has investigated three Qatari companies in construction and cleaning and found 1,620 workers submitted complaints after their wages were stopped", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef0c443c21f497c5431f3f2f0b5b3c1b9bce248a/0_276_6694_4017/master/6694.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a3df0dd31a3b9205d0328df2cd43d6d", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
