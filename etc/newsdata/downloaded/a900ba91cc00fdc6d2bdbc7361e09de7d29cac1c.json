In electric vehicle hot spots, such as Norway and the Netherlands, \"we see a very positive response.\"\n\nByton plans to export vehicles from its factory in Nanjing, to Europe in 2021, Kirchert said, adding that exporting to the United States would be a challenge if Washington and Beijing did not resolve their trade war.\n\nHe said Byton still hoped to launch in the United States in 2021, but tariffs would threaten the company's goal of selling vehicles at a starting price of about $45,000.\n\n\"We decided no matter what\" Byton will launch in the United States, even at a higher price, he said.\n\nChina's Great Wall Motor may consider building car manufacturing facilities in the European Union once its sales there hit 50,000 units a year, its chairman told Reuters at the show.\n\nGerman carmakers have been forced to accelerate electrification plans after the EU imposed a 37.5% cut in carbon dioxide emissions between 2021 and 2030 in addition to a 40% cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021.\n\nPSA Group <PEUP.PA> Chief Executive Carlos Tavares used the show to step up criticism of Europe's aggressive approach toward emissions limits.\n\n\"The word dialogue has become meaningless in Europe,\" he said, referring to the requirements placed on the auto industry.\n\n\"Politicians can decide rules without any discussion with industry,\" he told journalists on the sidelines of the show.\n\nElectric cars made up only 1.5% of global sales last year, or 1.26 million of the 86 million passenger vehicles sold, JATO Dynamics said.\n\nIf carmakers fail to meet the 2021 targets they could face a combined 33 billion euros in fines, analysts at Evercore ISI have estimated.\n\nThey also estimate it will cost the auto industry an aggregate 15.3 billion euros to comply, assuming a 60 euro cost per gram to reduce CO2 emissions for premium carmakers and 40 euros per gram of CO2 reduction for volume manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Edward Taylor; Editing by Mark Potter)", "description": "Chinese suppliers and manufacturers have stepped up their presence at the Frankfurt auto show, capitalizing on a strong position in electric technologies forced on European carmakers by regulators seeking to curb pollution.
