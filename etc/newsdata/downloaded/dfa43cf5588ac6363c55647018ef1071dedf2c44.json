The summit, attended by the EU's 27 leaders, is seen as perhaps the final opportunity for Britain and the EU to resolve their major differences over Brexit.\n\nJohnson told Britain's Cabinet on Wednesday that \"there was a chance of securing a good deal but we are not there yet,\" according to his official spokesman James Slack.\n\nBut that hope suffered a blow early Thursday when members of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said they would not be able to support a deal \"as it stands.\" Johnson needs the DUP on his side because he does not have an absolute majority in Parliament, which also needs to approve any agreement with the EU.\n\nIf a deal isn't reached by the weekend, Johnson may be forced to ask for a Brexit extension, he could be forced out of office by lawmakers or even resign. The outcome, whatever happens, could also trigger a new general election.\n\nYet even if a deal is reached, it still needs to be approved by Britain's Parliament. Any such vote could come Saturday. Ex-Prime Minister Theresa May resigned in May after repeatedly failing to get a Brexit deal she negotiated with the EU through Parliament.\n\nSince becoming Britain's prime minister in July, Johnson has taken a series of controversial steps to try to force through Brexit, including suspending Parliament, a move Britain's highest court ruled was unlawful. Johnson denies allegations that he lied to Queen Elizabeth II when he sought her permission to suspend Parliament.\n\nThe Brexit vote, and the fraught and labyrinthine negotiations that have followed it, have already led to the resignation of two British leaders; bitterly divided British households; caused deep anxiety among the nation's business community; and left millions of EU nationals living in Britain \u2013 as well as millions of Britons living on the continent in EU countries \u2013 wondering what the impact on their rights will be.\n\nUnder the EU's reciprocity laws, nationals of any EU country have the ability to live and work in any other EU country. Brexit will alter those rights and many other laws.\n\n'Bewildering, disastrous':Queen has a Brexit escape plan, but how bad will it be?\n\nJohnson is in a race against time to get a deal done because he has vowed to take Britain out of the EU by Halloween, even if it means leaving the bloc without a formal withdrawal agreement \u2013 a so-called no-deal Brexit.\n\nYet quite how he'll be able to do that without an exit deal is difficult to see because Britain's Parliament has passed legislation prohibiting him from doing so. Johnson has also vowed to obey that legislation, which requires him, by Saturday, to ask the EU for a Brexit extension if no deal is reached.\n\nThe consequences of a so-called no-deal Brexit are difficult to predict but most economists expect it would significantly harm Britain's economy.\n\nCurrent and former officials have been warning for months that a no-deal Brexit could lead to chaos on Britain's borders, would upend security arrangements, but leave little in their place. There could also be shortages of fresh food and some essential medicines, although Britain's government has said it has taken adequate emergency planning for any such disruptions. Most British lawmakers oppose a no-deal Brexit.\n\nA major source of the Brexit dispute between Britain and the EU is about seeking ways to avoid a \"hard\" border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. An open customs border between Britain's Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland underpins both the local economy and the 1998 peace accord that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant violence in Northern Ireland. But once Britain exits the EU, that border will turn into an external EU frontier that the bloc wants to keep secure. Britain is concerned that if Northern Ireland stays in an EU customs union it will be tethered indefinitely to the EU.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said Thursday that her party \"could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues,\" referring to a say Northern Ireland's authorities might have in future EU-related negotiations.\n\nLate Wednesday, Johnson likened the Brexit talks to climbing Mount Everest, British broadcaster the BBC reported, according to remarks it said he gave to an influential committee of pro-Brexit lawmakers, known as the 1922 committee.\n\nJohnson said the summit was \"not far\" but still surrounded by \"cloud.\"\n\nBrexit fallout:Champagne makers aren't worried about Brexit", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson is frantically pushing for a breakthrough Brexit deal with the EU that will enable an orderly withdrawal from\u00a0the bloc.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/16/USAT/edf8a693-92f5-4561-8952-52919749e50d-GTY_1175945511.JPG?crop=3499,1968,x0,y48&width=2951&height=1968&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
