Now is a good time to change your password.\n\nDoorDash announced the breach Thursday in a blog post. DoorDash said it initially noticed \u201cunusual activity involving a third-party service provider\u201d earlier this month, at which time it says it launched an investigation into the incident. The company said that its probe, which involved outside experts in security, found that the third-party accessed user data on May 4.\n\nDoorDash said that while not everyone on its platform was affected in the incident, the 4.9 million people who may be impacted by the breach joined on or before April 5, 2018. That exposed data includes profile names, phone numbers, emails, delivery address (which would likely include home and work addresses), order history and hashed passwords. Some 100,000 dashers had their driver\u2019s licence numbers exposed in the breach, and DoorDash says that the exposed data of some platform users included the last four digits of their bank account (dashers and merchants) or credit cards on file (customers).\n\nDoorDash said that it\u2019s currently in the process of notifying affected parties. One current worker who received such an email from DoorDash and shared that correspondence with Gizmodo was informed that \u201cwe believe that some of your DoorDash user account information has been accessed.\u201d Beyond that, however, the email included nearly identical language to what was published in the company\u2019s public-facing blog.\n\nIn both the email and in the company\u2019s notice, DoorDash said that while it doesn\u2019t think that user passwords have been compromised, it is \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d encouraging concerned users or those who believe they may have been affected to change their passwords.\n\nDoorDash stated that while it doesn\u2019t think the bank information exposed would be enough to allow a bad actor to make fraudulent charges or withdrawals, taken together with the other compromised data, it\u2019s probably a good idea to keep an eye on your bank account as well if you believe you\u2019ve been affected.\n\n\u201cWe took immediate steps to block further access by the unauthorised user and to enhance security across our platform,\u201d the company said. \u201cThese steps include adding additional protective security layers around the data, improving security protocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside expertise to increase our ability to identify and repel threats.\u201d", "description": "San Francisco delivery service DoorDash has announced that the personal data of 4.9 million people on its platform \u2014 including customers, dashers, and its merchants \u2014 has been compromised in a security breach.
