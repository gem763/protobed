These are all very human and subjective, people who observe the world whether they\u2019re artists or scientists, they\u2019re always on the cusp of what they see and what\u2019s internal that they\u2019re imposing. This piece is very dramatically and very strongly imposing of the subjective experience because it\u2019s so active.\u201d\n\n4. Van Gogh didn\u2019t think The Starry Night was one of his best\n\nIn fact he considered the painting a failure, reveals presenter Alastair Sooke. In a letter to Theo, his art dealer brother, Vincent referred to it as a study and he didn\u2019t even add it to a batch of paintings he hoped his brother would sell for him.\n\n5. The Cyprus trees may have a special significance\n\nIn the foreground are two silhouetted Cyprus trees. \u201cSince ancient times the Cyprus had been associated with immortality all around the Mediterranean. When he painted The Starry Night was he already thinking about the afterlife?\u201d asks Alistair. \u201cAfter all, a year or so after completing the picture, following a deterioration in his mental illness, he eventually committed suicide.\u201d\n\n6. The scientist has to be a bit of an artist to make a black hole something we can see\n\nJanna says \u201cHaving taken a picture of a black hole, it took telescopes distributed around the globe orbiting for a week and rotating to collectively analyse the data and create falsely what seemed like the snap of an eye, like one aperture shut but in fact was not, and then we colour code it because our eyes can\u2019t perceive those colours and then we look at it and we say \u2018Oh, look there\u2019s a black hole\u2019 but what are we really looking at? I think this is an expression again of where the human intervenes in the experience with the objective reality.\u201d\n\nThese words are echoed by Alistair: \u201cAstrophysicists create an image of space, the first accurate picture of a black hole. Van Gogh creates his own highly personal image of space in the form of Starry Night. Both are constructions, both are subjective.\u201d\n\nThe Way I See It is on BBC Radio 3 and you can listen to all the available episodes on BBC Sounds.", "description": "This Radio 3 series puts leading thinkers together with some of MOMA's greatest art works", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07r914t.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
