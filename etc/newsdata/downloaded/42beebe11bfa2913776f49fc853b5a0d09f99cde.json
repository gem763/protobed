Giuliani tweeted last week, writing that The Washington Post stooped \u201cso low as to actually ask me about my pending divorce, to see if it affects my work. It doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s private life has been splashed across New York tabloids for decades, and the lawyer representing his estranged wife thinks Giuliani is concealing money while working pro bono for President Trump. As a central figure in the Ukraine impeachment scandal, the exact nature of Giuliani\u2019s clients and income is of interest to more than divorce lawyers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot that he wants to talk about any of it.\n\n\u201cMy divorce is my personal business,\u201d Giuliani texted me last week. \u201cAnyway my opinion on it is the least objective as is my soon to be ex-wife. This is third divorce for both of us and thank goodness no children. If you can figure out the truth in a divorce proceeding, you should be on the High Court, the one above the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain why a marriage falls apart, or why two crazy kids once madly in love end up going at each other\u2019s throats.\n\n\u201cI feel betrayed by a man that I supported in every way for more than 20 years,\u201d Judith Giuliani told the New York Times last month. \u201cI\u2019m sad to know that the hero of 9/11 has become a liar.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s never a good time for a nasty split, but perhaps this is the very worst of times for Giuliani.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going through a divorce at the same time he\u2019s in the most precarious legal and professional situation of his life \u2014 and it\u2019s all happening on live TV,\u201d says Rebecca Katz, a New York political consultant. \u201cAnd there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone left in Trump\u2019s orbit with the inclination or authority to stop him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani, 75, is leaving this marriage the same way he entered it: with blaring headlines, tabloid updates and so much drama.\n\n\u201cHe digs it,\u201d says Ken Frydman, spokesman for his 1993 mayoral campaign. \u201cHe loves the attention. It\u2019s sport for him \u2014 and a lack of judgment.\u201d\n\nIn May 2000, New York\u2019s two-term mayor called a news conference and announced a separation from his second wife, television anchor Donna Hanover. It was also a public acknowledgment of his year-long relationship with Judith Nathan, whom he praised as a \u201cvery, very fine woman.\u201d The separation, however, was allegedly a surprise to his wife, who said she found out her 16-year marriage was ending by watching television.\n\nAD\n\nA surprise, but also not surprising: Hanover started dating Giuliani when he was married to his first wife, Regina Peruggi. An eternal mystery: When the mistress becomes the wife, why is she shocked when another mistress enters the scene? (\u201cJob opening,\u201d goes the old joke.) The New York papers alluded to other indiscretions, but nothing serious became public until the infamous news conference.\n\nAD\n\nNathan and Giuliani met in 1999 at Club Macanudo, an East Side cigar bar. Nathan, divorced from her second husband, was a hospital sales rep and a trained nurse. Across the room: Mayor Giuliani. Sparks flew.\n\n\u201cIt was the thunderbolt,\u2019\u2019 he told the New York Times. \u201cOur attraction was instantaneous. There was almost something mystical about the feeling.\u2019\u2019\n\nAD\n\nSoon, the two were inseparable, except for the quality time he spent with his wife and two children.\n\nThe affair was not, shall we say, discreet. Nathan accompanied the mayor to a number of official functions and stayed at his side during his treatment for prostate cancer, which led to his divorce lawyer\u2019s TMI revelation in 2001 that the cancer had rendered Giuliani impotent and the two had not had sex for a year. They were not ones to let the marriage of true minds admit impediments, so love flourished.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani and Hanover divorced in July 2002, and he married Nathan the following May in a ceremony at Gracie Mansion fit for royalty: The bride wore off-white and a tiara; the 400 guests included Yogi Berra, Henry Kissinger, Barbara Walters and Trump.\n\nAD\n\nBy this time, Giuliani had been crowned \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d and Time\u2019s 2001 Man of the Year, following his heroic response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. Prevented by law from seeking a third term as New York\u2019s mayor, he settled into life with Nathan as a celebrated power couple.\n\nFor the first time in his life, Giuliani was really rich. He was merely rich before \u2014 the divorce settlement gave Hanover more than $6 million \u2014 but now he was raking in serious bucks, commanding $100,000 per speech and private jets to fly in style. His bride accompanied him on all his trips; they required extra accommodations for staff \u2014 and an extra airplane seat for Judith Giuliani\u2019s designer purse, which she was unwilling to put on the floor, according to news reports. Old friends of the former mayor allege they were pushed aside when his new wife turned Giuliani into a country club kind of guy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were absolutely a good match,\u201d says Frydman, who says that Giuliani is not the same man he knew 25 years ago. \u201cThey\u2019re equally unsympathetic: People hate Judith and people hate Rudy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd they were equally ambitious: For a brief shining moment, Giuliani was the Republican front-runner for the 2008 presidential nomination. There were glowing profiles of the couple, complete with musings in New York magazine about what they would be like as president and first lady.\n\nHis presidential bid was thwarted by Sen. John McCain, and the Giulianis resumed life as Republican VIPs, buying properties \u2014 an elegant apartment on East 66th Street, homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and the Hamptons \u2014 and portfolios. There were box seats for the Yankees and the opera, private jets, Cuban cigars. Along the way, he amassed a fortune estimated at $45 million, according to several media reports.\n\nAD\n\nWhen it came to politics, Giuliani hung around in the background, until 2016, when he endorsed Trump because of their longtime New York connections and popped up as a featured speaker at the Republican convention.\n\nAD\n\nIn April 2018, he was named one of the president\u2019s personal lawyers, the same month Judith Giuliani filed for divorce in Manhattan Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we can blame Rudy\u2019s current meltdown on the divorce,\u201d says Katz. \u201cIt seems more likely that Rudy\u2019s meltdown led to the breakdown of his marriage, rather than the other way around.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in the marriage? And when did it happen?\n\n\u201cIt was an ongoing process that began when he lost the presidential campaign,\u201d Judith Giuliani told New York magazine last year. And then the coup de grace: \u201cFor a variety of reasons that I know as a spouse and a nurse he has become a different man.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n(As a nurse? Low blow.)\n\nAD\n\nThrough her lawyer, Judith Giuliani declined to be interviewed for this article. But she was more chatty last year amid rumors that her husband was dating Maria Rosa Ryan, a hospital administrator whom he took to the White House state dinner just weeks ago. The two have traveled abroad extensively and shared a night last year in a New Hampshire hotel, where he claims they were watching \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d Giuliani and Ryan say the relationship is not romantic.\n\nShortly after the New Hampshire screening, Judith Giuliani released a statement to the New York Post saying, \u201cMy husband\u2019s denial of the affair with the married Mrs. Ryan is as false as his claim that we were separated when he took up with her.\u201d\n\nDivorce filings in New York are not public documents, but enough has come out in news reports from the open hearings, which are vigorously covered by the New York tabloids.\n\nAD\n\nJudith Giuliani, 64, receives $42,000 a month in alimony, an amount she claims is peanuts compared with the $230,000 per month they spent as a couple, according to the New York Times. Her lawyer, Bernard Clair, reported that Giuliani earned millions working at the law firm Greenberg Traurig: Almost $8 million in 2016 and $9 million in 2017. He also claims that by working pro bono for Trump, his client\u2019s husband is deliberately concealing income and working with people who will have to \u201creimburse him\u201d at a later date.\n\nGiuliani, on the other hand, is pleading poverty. Because he is working for free and paying his own expenses, his lawyer says he can\u2019t afford to support his wife in the lifestyle to which she became accustomed and had to borrow money to pay taxes.\n\n\u201cMy reason for working for President Trump for free is wholly and entirely patriotic, and also because he is my friend,\u201d he told the New York Post.\n\nMeanwhile, they\u2019re reportedly fighting over everything: money, Christmas decorations, remote controls and who gets to hang out in which of the private clubs to which they belong.\n\nJudge Michael Katz told the couple: \u201cIt is beyond me why either party in this case would have an interest in having all of this done publicly.\u201d Settling, he said, \u201cwould treat their relationship and marriage with more respect than divulging all our dirty laundry out for public consumption.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not happening. There is some chatter in New York that Judith Giuliani is writing a book \u2014 or it might be a savvy negotiating tactic for someone with no prenuptial and a good memory.", "description": "The former mayor\u2019s personal life is also making headlines as the Ukraine impeachment scandal plays out.", "authors": ["Roxanne Roberts", "Feature Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CmTBhIXk6DUDeZrLiCU49Xh42Wo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HKZIHNXMNII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
