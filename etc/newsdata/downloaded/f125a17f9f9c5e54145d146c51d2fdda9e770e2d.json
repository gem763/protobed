Lewis had also read two internal emails from parents, and mocked them (without using their full names).\n\nRELATED: Jeff Lewis\u2019 SiriusXM Show Jeff Lewis Live Expands to 5 Days a Week\n\nJeff Lewis, Gage Edward and their daughter Monroe | Jeff Lewis/Instagram More\n\n\u201cApparently I\u2019ve mentioned a few things about the school on air,\u201d Lewis said, later apologizing about his words. \u201cI take full responsibility. \u2026 I am really, really sorry. I feel terrible about what happened. I know how it has affected Monroe. I will never do this again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to s\u2013 talk, I\u2019m going to do it off the air, obviously,\u201d he added.\n\nRELATED: Jeff Lewis Pictured With New Boyfriend For the First Time Since Split from Gage Edward\n\nLewis said he got the call about the expulsion on Friday, but didn\u2019t speak to the headmistress for the school until the next day.\n\nThough he claimed he appealed to her, apologizing and asking for a second chance, the school was apparently unwavering in their decision.\n\nThat left the outspoken star feeling frustrated.\n\n\u201cThe conversation lasted 20 minutes. For the first 12-13 minutes I groveled and then when I realized there was no hope, it got a bit contentious,\u201d Lewis recalled on Tuesday\u2019s episode. \u201cI said, \u2018I cannot believe this is the Montessori way!\u2019 You don\u2019t get to make amends. There are no second chances, no warnings \u2014 nothing. It was immediately, \u2018They\u2019re expelled.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tougher than Sirius,\u201d Lewis joked, noting how he had been disciplined by the streaming radio company\u2019s HR department in the past. \u201cSirius at least gave me warnings!\u201d\n\nJeff Lewis' daughter Monroe | Jeff Lewis/Instagram More\n\nForm there, Lewis said he and the school\u2019s headmistress argued.", "description": "Jeff Lewis' Daughter, 2, Expelled from Montessori Preschool", "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UDITstGJOwqx2sp3n.jd1w--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/c9f0677898e4c2882b76f0da9d2436c1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
