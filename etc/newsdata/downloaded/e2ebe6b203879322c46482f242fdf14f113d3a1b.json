Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.\u201d\n\nAccording to Trump, al-Baghdadi and a \u201clarge number\u201d of his fighters were killed on Saturday night in Idlib Province, Syria, after a raid by U.S. Special Operations forces. Trump offered a dramatic narration of the raid, which he said he was able to watch and took \u201capproximately two hours.\u201d He gave a graphic account of the terrorist being chased down a tunnel by American troops \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming all the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down,\u201d Trump said of Baghdadi. \u201cHe ignited the vest, killing himself and three of his children. \u201cHe died like a dog.\u201d\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s body was badly mutilated but was positively identified on the spot by a DNA match, Trump said. \u201cWe had his DNA.\u201d\n\nTrump said the U.S. had been pursuing al-Baghdadi for years and described \u201ccapturing or killing\u201d the leader as \u201cthe top national security priority of my administration.\u201d He said the intelligence that led to finding al-Baghdadi came together in recent months, and the operation had been planned for about two weeks.\n\nPresident Trump delivers a televised address from the White House Sunday.

He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump warned other terrorist leaders could face a similar fate but stressed the unique importance of killing al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re after these leaders, and we have others in sight, very bad ones, but this was the big one. This was the biggest one perhaps that we\u2019ve ever captured,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAs he stressed the importance of taking down al-Baghdadi, Trump suggested the ISIS leader\u2019s death was even more significant than the 2011 U.S. operation that killed al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, who was the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was very big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country \u2026 and was trying to do it again.\u201d\n\nThis file image made from video posted in 2014 purports to show the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Trump\u2019s future (now ousted) national security adviser John Bolton said that Obama killed bin Laden in the same sense that Richard Nixon personally landed on the Moon in 1969.\n\nISIS has been a deadly presence in the Middle East and Africa, but it has also inspired followers to mount terror attacks abroad. In the United States, ISIS was cited by the perpetrators of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., which left 19 people dead, and the 2015 San Bernardino attacks, in which 14 people were killed, among others. ISIS also became known for releasing dramatic videos of executions that included U.S. journalists.", "description": "President Trump announced the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State, or ISIS, group, in a televised address on Sunday morning.", "authors": ["Hunter Walker", "White House Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ak.v5qWvsQEXTHUTmYy0NQ--~B/aD0yNzI0O3c9NDA4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/48db0a20-f8be-11e9-bd62-b6fe5229f368", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
