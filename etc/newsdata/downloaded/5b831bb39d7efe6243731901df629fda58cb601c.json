After a failed treatment for what doctors believed was an imbalance with his antibodies causing inflammation in the cerebellum, John\u2019s health began to rapidly decline.\n\nA scan of his brain in April revealed that there was a mass where doctors initially thought there was inflammation. Follow up scans revealed several more masses. Eventually, John\u2019s family was told the devastating news -- that their son has a rare and aggressive cancer.\n\nSince receiving multiple treatments and undergoing several hours-long surgeries, John has returned to his home in Whitehall, New York, where he has entered hospice care.\n\nAs he continues to struggle with his breathing, his appetite and his pain levels, there is one thing his family says brings him peace.\n\nJohn was named an honorary captain of the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Department in June and as a result, he received an outpouring of support from his local law enforcement community. Since then, firefighters, EMS and members of the military have joined in reaching out to John.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign set up by John\u2019s aunt has asked for \u201cpatches and prayers\u201d as his family told Fox News, it\u2019s the only thing he seems to be responding to lately.\n\nOHIO MAN GOES TO EMERGENCY ROOM FOR BUG BITE, RECEIVES CANCER DIAGNOSIS INSTEAD\n\nCarrie Rivette, John\u2019s mom, told Fox News that her son has a connection with these communities.\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s great-grandpa served in World War II, his papa was in the Navy and a firefighter, [his] dad and grandfather are Marines and his dad is a police officer,\u201d she said, adding that his uncles also served in the Air Force and are members of their local fire and EMS community.\n\n\u201cHe grew up knowing that police, firemen, EMTs and military members were a part of something bigger than themselves. He respects them and admired them.\u201d\n\nRivette says her son holds the coins and letters he\u2019s received daily and they help to put a smile on his face on the most challenging days.\n\n\u201cHe is still fighting and being super strong,\u201d she said.\n\nSince asking, John\u2019s mom said he\u2019s received \u201ctoo many items to count.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJohn has received something from nearly every state except Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. He has even gotten a letter from Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark, although Carrie said the coin that was sent with the letter was lost in the mail.\n\nJohn has even received several visitors this week.\n\nAnyone that wishes to send John coins, patches and pins can send them \u201cCaptain\u201d John Francis Hoague-Rivette at PO Box 6, Whitehall, NY 12887.", "description": "The family of a young boy from New York who was diagnosed earlier this year with a rare and terminal brain cancer is asking members of the military, law enforcement, EMS and firefighting communities to send along \u201cpatches and prayers\u201d as he continues his difficult battle.", "authors": ["Paulina Dedaj", "Paulina Dedaj Is A Writer", "Reporter For Fox News.
