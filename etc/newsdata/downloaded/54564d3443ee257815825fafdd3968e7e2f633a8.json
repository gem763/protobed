Decanters are traditional, elegant and sometimes incredibly expensive. The ritual of decanting is so ingrained in wine tradition that it is included in the service examination for the Court of Master Sommeliers certification program.\n\nMore recently, devices called aerators became popular. You pour a wine through this gizmo into your glass or decanter, and a swirling, gurgling effect adds air violently, instantly aging the wine, supposedly. I\u2019ve never been convinced aerators had more than a momentary effect on a wine\u2019s flavor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conventional wisdom about allowing a wine to breathe is controversial. Simply pulling a cork or twisting off a screw cap and letting a bottle stand for a while will not add much air to wine \u2014 only a little bit of liquid is exposed in the neck of the bottle.\n\nEven decanting has its detractors. Exposing a wine to air allows its aromas to dissipate, not develop, according to this argument. And why would you want to lose flavor?\n\nKeith Goldston, a master sommelier who is beverage director for Landry\u2019s, a national restaurant group based in Houston, is a decanting skeptic.\n\n\u201cIn wine, we are always looking for a fail-safe solution,\u201d Goldston says. \u201cI find decanting unpredictable \u2014 sometimes it works, sometimes it hurts, sometimes it does nothing at all. It always leaves you more of a mess, and decanters rarely fit in the dishwasher.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey work for restaurants, though. \u201cI guarantee you, if a restaurant is decanting a lot of wine, they are selling more. But it\u2019s mostly for show.\u201d\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about those tannic baby reds we are too impatient to age properly?\n\n\u201cThe conventional wisdom says big, young reds benefit from decanting, but I\u2019ve found they tend to shut down even more,\u201d Goldston says. A wine \u201cshuts down\u201d when it tastes tight and unyielding, as if it is safeguarding its flavors rather than sharing them.\n\nTo be honest, I was skeptical about Goldston\u2019s skepticism. Time after time, I\u2019ve enjoyed wines that clearly blossomed in the hours or even days after I opened them, revealing nuances with each sip. Not every wine, of course, but this has become one way I identify quality in a wine. Sure, the wine could be having a positive effect on me, as could the occasion or conversation, but is this idea of a wine improving simply a mirage?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA lot of wines have an elegance that, as you pour them out of the bottle and swirl them in your glass, they do get better and more expressive,\u201d Goldston says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the time, not just the amount of air.\u201d No fancy toys like decanters or aerators needed.\n\nGoldston concedes that decanting is worthwhile in certain situations. Older red wines, more than a decade past their vintage, are probably throwing some sediment. Decanting allows you to take the wine off that detritus that can make every sip unpleasant. Decant right before drinking though, as these wines have spent enough time in bottle already.\n\nFull-bodied white wines, such as burgundies or skin-fermented orange wines, may also benefit from spending time in a decanter, he says. And if, in the middle of a dinner party, you decide to bring a special wine out of your really cold cellar to share with your guests, run warm water over the outside of a decanter and then pour the wine in.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd that last bit of advice may actually be the most important key to getting the most enjoyment from your wine. It\u2019s not the air, but the temperature. We tend to drink our red wines too warm and our whites too cold.\n\n\u201cIf you want your red wines to taste their best for a dinner party, put them in the fridge a few hours before, and when your first guest arrives, take them out and let them warm at room temperature for 30 minutes or so,\u201d Goldston advises. \u201cTake your whites out of the fridge 30 minutes before your guests are due. If they get too warm, you can always put them back to chill a little more.\u201d\n\nMore from Food:\n\nAD", "description": "Should you decant your wine, and if so, when?", "authors": ["Dave Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hNRAz_Hwbpxm-coRSOffoxhp360=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GMOMKYAVCII6TEFICNX2IS4AXI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
