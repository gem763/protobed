Maxine Waters, has recently announced its plans to prioritize scrutiny of Facebook\u2019s proposal for Libra and corresponding digital wallet Calibra as part of its fall 2019 agenda.\n\nAccording to The Information\u2019s sources, Sandberg will be questioned about Libra as well as about Facebook\u2019s advertising policies. The social media titan reached a $5 million settlement with civil rights groups this March over the allegations that its advertising had facilitated discriminatory practices in the housing market.\n\nShould the testimony take place, Sandberg would be the second Facebook executive to testify before the Committee regarding Libra. In mid-July, Calibra CEO David Marcus testified about matters including anti-money laundering and other compliance measures, as well as the issue of public and government trust in the company\u2019s surveillance and data collection measures.\n\nA hostile response from lawmakers\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Rep.
