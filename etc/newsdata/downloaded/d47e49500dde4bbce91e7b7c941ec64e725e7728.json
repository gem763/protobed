A text message to supporters Tuesday afternoon said, \u201cNancy just called for impeachment,\u201d and asked them to make a donation, with $45 the suggested amount.\n\nThe campaign also sent an email to supporters Wednesday after the White House released the text of Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelenskiy. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d the solicitation says, \u201cTrust me, you saw the transcript.\u201d That pitch asked for donations of $5 and up. -- Bill Allison\n\nElizabeth Warren\u2019s Having a Good Week in Polls (11:14 a.m.)\n\nElizabeth Warren has had quite the week for positive polls.\n\nShe\u2019s leading by 9 points over Joe Biden in California in a Los Angeles Times/University of California Berkeley poll out Wednesday, giving her an early lead in the country\u2019s largest Democratic state.
