So the connection between IP protection and being competitive is a direct one. I want to emphasize as much as possible the importance of capitalisation and understanding that this IP protection is not only a cost. It means some costs, it's not easy to do it. If you go international, it costs a lot of money. For example if you go in several countries in Europe, it might cost about 40,000 euro. But, we should see behind [this] the importance of the investment. And you can increase your revenues and your profitability when you care about it, but I advise not to do it alone. SMEs, especially, should use services like mine or my colleagues or professionals, IP attorneys, different services they can help them, especially concerning IP protection.\u201d\n\nHow can companies wanting to better protect their IP get in touch with somebody like you?\n\n\"First of all there is a European help desk, IP Help Desk. Inside the framework of this IP Helpdesk service exists a network of ambassadors. I'm a part of them. In Romania we have three ambassadors, which cover more or less regionally, the three main important regions in Romania and because of this we can be near to the companies and they have the job to do services for SMEs, especially to increase their knowledge about IP protection and capitalisation.\"", "description": "Business Planet speaks to Professor Alexandru Marin, a European IP Helpdesk Ambassador who supports and advises SMEs in Romania on how to secure their IP rights.", "authors": ["Paul Hackett"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/19/69/10/1000x563_cmsv2_2b77dd7d-69d3-50d7-97a8-6f9866960447-4196910.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
