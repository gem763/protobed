The news, reported earlier today by Wisconsin Public Radio, is another inexplicable twist in the nearly two-year train wreck that is Foxconn\u2019s US manufacturing plans.\n\nThe company originally promised five so-called innovation centers throughout the state would that employ as many as 100 to 200 people each in high-skilled jobs, with the Milwaukee center promising as many as 500. Those jobs were to complement the more than 13,000 jobs Foxconn said its initial Wisconsin electronics manufacturing factory would bring to the US, in exchange for billions in tax breaks and incentives that Governor Scott Walker granted the company back in 2017.\n\nThe innovation centers are not only empty, but now on hold too\n\nYet after purchasing a building in Milwaukee and announcing plans to build the centers in other Wisconsin cities, Foxconn has done virtually nothing with the plans. In April, The Verge reported that the buildings Foxconn had purchased were empty, a report that the company disputed without providing any specific corrections or evidence to the contrary \u2014 and the company still hasn\u2019t provided any 194 days later.\n\nAccording to WPR, Foxconn has installed an HVAC system in one of two buildings it said it would purchase in Eau Claire, but no additional work has been completed. \u201cThat\u2019s been about the extent of it, it\u2019s pretty minimal,\u201d Aaron White, Eau Claire\u2019s economic development manager, told WPR. \u201cWe did get a visit from four Foxconn staffers and they reinforced their intent to move forward, but they gave no indication of a timeline.\u201d\n\nIn Racine, another planned innovation center destination, there does not appear to have been any work done whatsoever. \u201cFoxconn is focusing on the (Mount) Pleasant campus,\u201d Shannon Powell, a spokesman for Racine Mayor Cory Mason, told WPR. \u201cShould an innovation center in the city get up and running there would certainly be a grand opening event.\u201d\n\nBeyond the halted innovation centers, Foxconn\u2019s general Wisconsin plans are similarly in flux. The company announced a partnership in September with an automated coffee kiosk company to help manufacture its product domestically, with plans to add the coffee kiosk to its manufacturing contracts for the planned Mount Pleasant factory.\n\nBut the factory doesn\u2019t exist yet. The company is now aiming to open it in 2020 after repeatedly shifting its deadlines. It\u2019s also reduced the planned number of jobs and the size of the factory from the original 13,000 jobs and 20 million square feet to a 1,500-employee, 1-million-square foot facility that will no longer produce the promised big-screen LCD TVs that were part of the initial contract. Earlier this month, the company announced, scrapped, and then re-announced plans to build a giant, nine-story glass orb that would serve as a data center.", "description": "Electronics manufacturer Foxconn\u2019s promised Wisconsin \"innovation centers,\" which are to employ hundreds of people in the state if they ever get built, are officially on hold after spending months empty and unused, as the company focuses on meeting revised deadlines on the LCD factory it promised would now open by next year.", "authors": ["Nick Statt", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7ITNq_toby6BltzVJXraUMXvJI=/0x279:2040x1347/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13338929/jlott_181024_3052_0630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
