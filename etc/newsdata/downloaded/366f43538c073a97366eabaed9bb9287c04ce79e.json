Its design is terribly dull. The screen is glossy and might not get as bright as you\u2019d like. This laptop wouldn\u2019t strike you as particularly thin or svelte.\n\nBut then you pick it up.\n\nThe $999 Swift 5 weighs just 2.2 pounds (0.998kg), making it the lightest 15-inch laptop in the world. You\u2019ll immediately question whether you\u2019re holding an actual functioning laptop or some empty design mock-up. It\u2019s very real, as you\u2019ll immediately discover once you hit the power button and see the vivid 1080p display light up.\n\nThe classic struggle between 15-inch laptops and those with smaller screens has always been about weight and portability. My 15-inch MacBook Pro rarely leaves the house, whereas Google\u2019s Pixelbook and my 13-inch MacBook Pro at the office are far easier to carry around without my back crying for mercy. But the Swift 5 completely blows up that way of thinking.\n\nOur review of Acer Swift 5 (2019) Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Unfathomably light for the screen size you get\n\nDetailed, colorful 1080p display\n\nReliable battery life\n\nGood performance for everyday usage Bad Stuff Soulless design\n\nNo Thunderbolt 3\n\nNo SD card slot\n\nWay too much bloatware Buy for $982.22 from Amazon Buy for $945.85 from Walmart\n\nYou get a large canvas for doing work, browsing the web, or watching movies without the traditional heft you\u2019d expect. This machine is not a burden. Microsoft\u2019s Surface Laptop 2 weighs 2.76 pounds and has a 13.5-inch screen. Dell\u2019s XPS 13 is 2.7 pounds. Let that sink in for a minute. This 15-inch laptop weighs less than two of the best 13-inch laptops on the market. Meanwhile, the 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs in at 4.02 pounds. That\u2019s not exactly a fair comparison; the MacBook is obviously a far more powerful tool. But it\u2019s a useful reference for just how airy the Swift 5 feels compared to what you might be using right now.\n\nSo, how did Acer make this thing so light? Through materials and efficient engineering. The top and bottom shells of the Swift 5 are constructed from a magnesium-lithium alloy, and the keyboard casing is a magnesium-aluminum blend. The laptop feels sturdy enough in regular use, if a bit hollow. But the display will flex pretty easily if you grab it with both hands and push inward toward yourself. I\u2019m not going to lie: you could probably easily break it if you wanted to, but I\u2019ve seen no cause for concern. The Swift 5 survived a cross-country flight in an overpacked bag without any issues.\n\nAcer Swift 5 specs 15.6-inch 1080p IPS touchscreen\n\nQuad-core Intel Core i5 or i7 processor\n\n8GB or 16GB of RAM\n\n256GB or 512GB SSD\n\n2.2 pounds\n\nUSB ports: one USB-C, two USB-A\n\nWindows Hello fingerprint reader\n\nStarts at $999.99\n\nOnly comes in silver\n\nAs I mentioned at the top, the design here is very play-it-safe and bland. Acer\u2019s logo is on the silver lid, and the very PC-looking bottom has two downward-firing speakers, cooling vents, and a bunch of Torx screws. (You can remove the bottom plate rather easily, but all of the Swift 5\u2019s core hardware components are unsurprisingly soldered to the motherboard and non-replaceable.) The Swift 5\u2019s outer design is incredibly plain, and it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to something like HP\u2019s Spectre x360. Perhaps this bare-bones style is necessary to hit that 2.2-pound mark.\n\nOn the laptop\u2019s left side is all of your connectivity: power, HDMI out, two USB 3.0 ports, and a single USB 3.1 Type-C port to round things out. (Acer offers power-off USB charging, so you can juice up your phone or other accessories even when the laptop is shut off.) Note that the Swift 5\u2019s power adapter doesn\u2019t use USB-C to charge by default, so you\u2019ll have to carry around the included barrel plug charger unless you\u2019ve got a wall / phone charger capable of some decent USB-C Power Delivery. If there were an SD card reader next to all of those, I\u2019d have very few complaints about port selection. As it stands, there\u2019s just one other: the Swift 5 doesn\u2019t support Thunderbolt 3, so external GPUs are out of the question. You\u2019d be right in assuming that this super-light laptop lacks discrete graphics, so it\u2019s a far cry from any kind of gaming machine. Don\u2019t bother with anything but the most casual titles. The right side is where you\u2019ll find the headphone jack, security lock, and battery indicator lights.\n\nOpening the Swift 5\u2019s lid is a little more annoying than it should be; there\u2019s no indentation on the keyboard deck, so it can be difficult to pull up the screen one-handed. Once you do, you\u2019ll see the 15.6-inch IPS display surrounded by a black, soft-touch bezel. The screen is extremely glossy and has a sticky texture. I actually like the friction this creates when using the touchscreen, but I can see how others might prefer a smoother glide. The display can lay flat on a table, but it won\u2019t flip back behind the keyboard. The Swift 5\u2019s 1080p display is very detailed and colorful, though it doesn\u2019t offer quite as wide of a color gamut as something like the Surface Laptop 2 or other high-end machines. It gets decently bright, but the screen\u2019s reflectivity had me wishing I could crank things up a little higher \u2014 especially outdoors or in a sunny coffee shop. I\u2019m nitpicky about displays and didn\u2019t notice any unsightly backlight bleed or other quality control warning signs.\n\nThe keyboard might seem very par for the course, but remember that you\u2019re getting a very spacious one in a fantastically light package. The black chiclet keys offer good travel and satisfying clacky feedback. The arrow keys have half-size up and down buttons and the backlighting is non-adjustable, but those are really the only downsides I\u2019ve noticed. As for the touchpad, I didn\u2019t have any issues with gestures or swipes, but it is loud and requires a firm press to actuate. So I mostly stuck with taps.\n\nThe laptop\u2019s front-facing camera isn\u2019t capable of Windows Hello face recognition, so Acer built in a fingerprint reader to the right of the keyboard as a quick way of bypassing the lock screen. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve found it to be inconsistent, especially if you\u2019re accustomed to the near-instant fingerprint scanners on modern smartphones. I often had to enter a PIN after a few failed attempts on the Swift 5. Retraining it with my index finger a second time seemed to help, but I much prefer the camera-powered login feature of the Surface and other PCs.\n\nAs for power, the Swift 5 has a quad-core Core i5-8265U 1.6Ghz processor from Intel\u2019s Whiskey Lake lineup. That\u2019s the $999 base model I tested with a 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM; you can also buy an upgraded i7 version with 16GB of RAM. But I found the i5 was plenty good at handling my day-to-day workload of Slack and dozens of Chrome tabs open at once. It also nailed media consumption in YouTube, Spotify, and other apps without showing any signs of slowing down. There\u2019s a Dolby Audio emblem near the upper right of the keyboard, but don\u2019t let that influence your sound expectations, as the Swift 5\u2019s speakers are very average.\n\nThis is far from the best in Intel\u2019s processor family, so you\u2019ll be met with some extended waits if you\u2019re working with video or a massive RAW photo library. But for most common productivity tasks, you shouldn\u2019t run into any trouble or performance issues.\n\nOut of the box, the Swift 5 has an alarming, truly obnoxious amount of bloatware. Microsoft\u2019s decision to stuff up Windows 10 Home with Candy Crush and the like is frustrating in its own right, but that\u2019s compounded here by McAfee, a suite of games from WildTangent (over 20 by my count), and other throwaways like eBay and Booking.com. You\u2019ll even see ads from time to time in the notification sidebar from Acer\u2019s JumpStart app.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why manufacturers think that selling an inexpensive laptop gives them free rein to annoy customers with tacky spam and unwelcome distractions, but they seem hell-bent on maintaining that status quo. You\u2019ll have to spend a fair bit of time uninstalling junk if you don\u2019t want it wasting space on your PC.\n\nBattery life on the Swift 5 is very strong, averaging between eight and nine hours in my time with the laptop so far. That\u2019s on the cusp of a full workday, and it should be enough, especially if you can plug in for even an hour at some point.\n\nAcer\u2019s Swift 5 has a strong claim to stake its name on. As the lightest 15-inch laptop on the market today, it\u2019s a machine that will do what you need from it without weighing you down when you carry it around. There are better and more powerful laptop choices out there: it\u2019s easy to argue that the XPS 15 is a smarter buy if you don\u2019t mind lugging around the extra weight. And if you don\u2019t need a screen this big, there\u2019s a strong selection of 13-inch laptops in the Windows ecosystem.\n\nBut the Swift 5 stands alone in putting a big display that\u2019s perfect for getting work done into a laptop this unfathomably light. It might look boring, be filled to the brim with bloat, and lack Thunderbolt 3, but those quibbles aren\u2019t enough to completely sink what\u2019s ultimately an endearingly portable laptop.", "description": "Acer\u2019s Swift 5 is a remarkably light Windows laptop at just 2.2 pounds \u2014 and that\u2019s with a 15.6-inch display.
