They chose to live in the house that Buonincontri bought on her own with a roughly $20,000 down payment. The house was located in New York, and she had assumed that state law would protect her right to the home in the event of a divorce, because it was her own property.\n\n\u201cI should have had a marital agreement that said it was my property,\u201d she said.\n\nEventually, Buonincontri\u2019s own parents got divorced, and her father developed health issues. To support her father, Buonincontri and her husband agreed to refinance the home\u2019s mortgage and give him the proceeds.\n\nAt the time though, Buonincontri was primarily a stay-at-home mother and was only working part-time as a financial planner while she went back to school to study for her financial planning certification. In order to qualify for the refinance, she added her husband to the house\u2019s deed so that his income could count in the underwriting of the new loan.\n\nYears later, when the couple initiated divorce proceedings, that decision came back to haunt her.\n\nAlso see: I saved $1 million for retirement without an adviser and I\u2019m only in my 40s \u2014 yet I spend my waking hours worrying\n\nDivorce proceedings put a major strain on her retirement savings\n\nInitially, the couple planned to go to a mediator to handle their divorce, which wouldn\u2019t have been expensive. But they bowed to pressure from family and friends and took the court route instead.\n\nBuonincontri and her ex-husband agreed to sell the home as part of the divorce settlement, with the proceeds meant to be split evenly between the two, even though she had originally purchased the home on her own.\n\nComplicating matters, health concerns arose for one of Buonincontri\u2019s two kids as the divorce was being finalized. In order to be closer to family for support, she decided to move to Arizona, where she now lives, over a very short period of time. She ultimately agreed to give up custody of her other child to her ex-husband so that she could leave New York.\n\nMichelle Buonincontri and her ex-husband spent roughly $200,000 in legal fees to get divorced.\n\nHer ex-husband did not want to sell the home, and because she was now living in another state it was more difficult for Buonincontri to follow up on the sale. Issues also came up regarding an individual retirement account Buonincontri retained in the divorce, which had contained both separate and marital assets. The divorce settlement did not reflect that she had kept this IRA as a concession in exchange for not receiving spousal support payments from her ex-husband and delaying child support. It also incorrectly identified the account as containing only Buonincontri\u2019s own assets.\n\nBy this point, Buonincontri and her husband had spent around $200,000 in legal fees between the two of them, she said, which exhausted most her cash savings. On top of that, Buonincontri had to dip into her retirement savings and rack up credit card debt to secure housing in Arizona, furnish her new home and pay for her child\u2019s expenses.\n\nRead more: This mother took her family on a $2,200 vacation to Disney World \u2014 for free\n\nFaced with the prospect of going to court to try to compel the sale of the New York house and settle the dispute regarding the IRA, Buonincontri allowed her ex-husband to keep the home and not proceed with selling it. At the time, the equity in the home that would have been split after the mortgage was paid off would have added up to roughly $250,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s had a significant impact on my retirement planning,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I moved I had to dip into my retirement assets to buy a home for me and my children because I didn\u2019t have that money.\u201d\n\nBetween the lost return on the sale of the home and the costs she incurred to pay for a lawyer and move across the country, Buonincontri lost around $200,000 that would have gone toward her retirement. Given that the stock market\u2019s average return is around 10% annually, those funds would have grown to $1 million over 20 years. Those calculations don\u2019t include the additional savings she missed out on as she worked to pay off the debt she accrued in this time.\n\nShe has not yet earned that money back. \u201cI\u2019m still working towards that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a huge loss. Based on the trajectory my husband and I had at the time, we could have retired at 50 with several million dollars.\u201d\n\n\u2018Just like you plan for death by having life insurance, you should think about your marriage the same way \u2014 what if divorce happens?\u2019 \u2014Michelle Buonincontri, a certified financial planner at Being Mindful in Divorce\n\nWhat she could have done differently \u2014 before she got married\n\nAs Buonincontri says, no one gets married thinking they\u2019re going to get divorced. But it\u2019s important to be realistic and honest about finances when choosing to get married.\n\n\u201cFolks are more likely to talk about their sex life or their most recent encounter on Tinder MTCH, -1.63% than they are to talk about finances,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause both she and her ex-husband had significant assets before they got married, the two could have avoided a lot of frustration down the road had they drafted a pre-nuptial agreement. \u201cJust like you plan for death by having life insurance, you should think about your marriage the same way \u2014 what if divorce happens?\u201d she said.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s important to work together as a couple to determine which assets to keep separate and which are considered jointly owned.\n\nCourtesy of Michelle Buonincontri Inspired by her own experience with divorce, Michelle Buonincontri now works as a certified divorce financial analyst, helping other couples to work out equitable divorce settlements.\n\nThe benefits of having a financial analyst in divorce proceedings\n\nAround two years after she moved to Arizona, Buonincontri got her divorce financial analyst certification, and today she advises clients who are ending marriages through her firm, Being Mindful in Divorce. \u201cI wanted other families to know there are alternatives,\u201d she said. \u201cHad a CDFA been part of my process, it would have made things clearer.\u201d\n\nBuonincontri said she turns to her personal experience with divorce when working with clients. Certified divorce financial analysts are hired to help couples looking to end a marriage work through the division of their assets to ensure an equitable settlement. CDFAs can be hired to work on behalf of one or both spouses.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: \u2018This money has been a life changer\u2019 \u2014 a woman living on the poverty line inherited $150K and shares her financial plan\n\nWhen they work with both spouses, the CDFA plays a neutral role. They typically ask to see multiple years\u2019 worth of financial statements, including bank statements, credit card bills, tax returns and retirement statements. They use these documents to verify the information on the affidavit of financial information provided to the court.\n\n\u201cIt just becomes about the data. It helps to take the emotions out of the economics.\u201d \u2014Buonincontri, on the benefits of working with a divorce financial analyst\n\nBeyond just looking at assets, these financial analysts will also study the couple\u2019s cash flow and model expected future returns on investments to ensure that the ultimate settlement is fair for both parties. A CDFA can also help a person seeking a divorce to get a budget in place as they adjust to life being single once again.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits Buonincontri sees in hiring a CDFA is to help approach the divorce negotiations more rationally. It can also help people set better priorities.\n\n\u201cYou get bullied and overwhelmed with the process as it drags out,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you work with a CDFA, it just becomes about the data. It helps to take the emotions out of the economics.\u201d", "description": "As a financial analyst, Michelle Buonincontri now works to help people achieve equitable divorce settlements.", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR303_buonin_MG_20190913153754.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
