That's not necessarily up to me to say,\" she added before confessing: \"I'd say Bruce Willis.\"\n\nHowever, Moore didn't divulge which movie she was referring to. The former couple worked together on the 1991 film \"Mortal Thoughts,\" the 1996 movie \"Beavis and Butt-Head Do America,\" as well as the 2003 flick \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,\" which saw Moore in a starring role, while Willis made a cameo.\n\nA shocked Corden let out a large laugh before posing the question again. Moore backtracked and clarified her answer: \"No. I can't say that he didn't deserve it.\"\n\n\"Well, then you're not answering the question,\" stated a confused Corden.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I can't say it,\" responded Moore, who then took a small sip of the hot sauce.\n\nMoore and the \u201cDie Hard\u201d franchise star, 64, were married from 1987 to 2000. They had three children together: Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah Belle, 25.\n\nThe exes are still on good terms, with Willis even stepping out to support Moore at the launch of her tell-all memoir, \"Inside Out,\" last month.", "description": "Moore backtracked and clarified her answer.", "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/demi-moore-bruce-willis-sl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
