So what is the truth about these training aids?\n\nIs it cruel to give your pet electric shocks? Just little ones? The work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has come under fire for using one on her beagle-pug cross, Lola, which reportedly kept trying to attack other dogs. She spoke to Steve Andrews, a Suffolk dog trainer, who recommended an electric collar to help control Lola\u2019s behaviour. This seemed to work, and Andrews has since asked Coffey to help to overturn the government\u2019s plans for a ban on remote-control collars. Awkwardly, the plans were announced by Michael Gove last year, when Coffey was a minister in his department.\n\n\u201cTh\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2019s dog responds on setting 11 [out of 100],\u201d Andrews told the Eastern Daily Press. \u201cShe felt what that was like and could feel nothing \u2026 This is not cruel. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and her family are dog lovers doing the best for their pet.\u201d\n\nBut is he right? Aversive training methods, and electric collars in particular, are opposed by the RSPCA, the Kennel Club, the Animal Behaviour and Training Council and the British Veterinary Association (BVA). Research commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that shock collars cause stress and don\u2019t train dogs any more effectively than the alternatives.\n\nTo be blunt, aversive training doesn\u2019t work because dogs are less intelligent than people. \u201cIf you shock your dog and, let\u2019s say, a bird is tweeting nearby, it might think: \u2018That bird has shocked me,\u2019\u201d Holly Conway of the Kennel Club explains. \u201cThe dog doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing that\u2019s unwanted, and associates the shock with something else.\u201d\n\nShock collars can influence a dog\u2019s behaviour for the better, but the effect is unpredictable, and there can be side-effects. While some dogs submit when they feel a shock, others react aggressively, making matters worse. \u201cEven when applied at a low level, electric pulses from these aversive shock collars can produce that anxiety reaction in dogs, and may also have long-term adverse effects on their behaviour and emotional responses,\u201d says Daniella Dos Santos, incoming president of the BVA. \u201cIn any case, there is a large body of evidence that positive training methods are more effective.\u201d\n\nIf a dog has problems, Dos Santos advises owners to talk to a vet, who can recommend a behaviourist. A rewards-based training system has been shown to get the best results. Meanwhile, research continues on how to control the behaviour of politicians.", "description": "Last year, the government announced plans to ban remote-control collars \u2013 but even a dog-owning minister is using one.
