The suit contends that Comcast refused to carry the channel because it \u201ccounters the liberal politics of Comcast\u2019s own news channel, MSNBC.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nA week after Herring sent an email to a Comcast executive, Maddow opened her MSNBC show by referring to a report in the Daily Beast that said an OAN employee also worked for Sputnik News, which is linked to the Russian government.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the most obsequiously pro-Trump right-wing news outlet in America really literally is paid Russian propaganda,\u201d Maddow said on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir on-air U.S. politics reporter is paid by the Russian government to produce propaganda for that government,\u201d Maddow said.\n\nIn the lawsuit, OAN said Kristian Rouz was a freelancer for Sputnik News, not a staff employee, and his work there had nothing to do with his work for OAN.\n\nThe lawsuit includes a statement from Rouz that said he wrote some 1,300 articles over the past 4 \u00bd years for Sputnik but \u201cI have never written propaganda, disinformation, or unverified information.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne America is wholly owned, operated and financed by the Herring family in San Diego. They are as American as apple pie. They are not paid by Russia and have nothing to do with the Russian government,\u201d Skip Miller, an attorney representing OAN, said in a statement. \u201cThis is a false and malicious libel, and they\u2019re going to answer for it in a court of law.\u201d\n\nThe suit names Maddow, Comcast, MSNBC and NBCUniversal Media.\n\nA message seeking comment from an MSNBC spokeswoman was not immediately returned.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit included an Aug. 6 letter from Amy Wolf, an attorney for NBCUniversal News Group, to OAN\u2019s attorney.\n\nIt said OAN \u201cpublishes content collected or created by a journalist who is also paid by the Russian government for writing over a thousand articles. Ms. Maddow\u2019s recounting of this arrangement is substantially true and therefore not actionable.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "A conservative television network sued Rachel Maddow for more than $10 million on Monday for calling it \"paid Russian propaganda.\"", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19253057916391.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
