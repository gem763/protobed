Edward J. Markey as he faces a possible Democratic primary challenge from Rep. Joe Kennedy", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) with Sen Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), right, at a news conference for their proposed Green New Deal in February. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nSen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) received a high-profile endorsement for reelection Friday from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) as he faces a potential primary challenge from another young Democrat with star power, Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.).\n\nIn a video posted on the Markey campaign\u2019s YouTube account, Ocasio-Cortez calls Markey \u201ca strong and progressive champion for working families, not just in Massachusetts but across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows about the issues of our time, and he\u2019s not just resting on his record of the past, but he\u2019s aggressively pursuing an agenda for the future,\u201d says Ocasio-Cortez, who last year at age 29 became the youngest woman to ever serve in Congress.\n\nKennedy, 38, the scion of a legendary political family, acknowledged last month that he is considering challenging Markey, 73, next year \u2014 a bid that could include a call for generational change.\n\n[Rep. Joe Kennedy says he\u2019s mulling a primary challenge to Sen. Edward J. Markey]\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Markey worked together to develop the Green New Deal, a blueprint popular among progressives that seeks a sweeping renovation of the U.S. economy to halt man-made climate change.\n\nIn her video, Ocasio-Cortez cites their collaboration, crediting Markey for being \u201cone of the few people to stand up and take a chance and take a chance on a freshman congresswoman and take a chance on this plan.\u201d\n\nMarkey is among the longest-serving members of Congress but a relative newcomer to statewide politics in Massachusetts, winning a 2013 special election to succeed Sen. John F. Kerry (D) after a 36-year House career.\n\nMarkey has amassed a long record on environmental and energy issues \u2014 particularly on the subject of climate change, chairing a House select committee on the subject from 2007 to 2011 \u2014 as well as on other issues. But national prominence has been elusive, and some Democrats in Massachusetts have come to believe he is vulnerable to a younger challenger.\n\nKennedy is the son of former congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) and the grandson of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.), as well as a grandnephew of President John F. Kennedy and the late senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.).\n\nThe younger Kennedy has not aggressively sought the national spotlight until recently.\n\nSince President Trump\u2019s election, he has occasionally created viral video moments \u2014 such as when Republicans sought unsuccessfully in 2017 to dismantle the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and won House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s nod to deliver the Democratic response to Trump\u2019s 2018 State of the Union address.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "The endorsement comes ahead of a Senate race in Massachusetts that could be about generational change.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm", "John Wagner Is A National Reporter Who Leads The Post'S New Breaking Political News Team.
