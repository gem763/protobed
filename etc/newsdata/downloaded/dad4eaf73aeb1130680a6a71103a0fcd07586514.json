The storm, which tied an 84-year-old record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane to come ashore, hovered over the islands after grinding to a virtual halt, driving a storm surge and blasting record winds and rain that could exceed 2 feet. The Salvation Army estimated that at least 13,000 homes were destroyed on one group of islands alone.

But forecasters remained unsure of whether, or where, it might make landfall in the U.S. after it takes an expected turn to the north. The National Hurricane Center warned that life-threatening storm surges and dangerous hurricane-force winds were expected along the east coast of Florida through midweek.\n\nView images from the Spring City, a town located in the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas.
