Amid Backlash, the Owner Is Now Apologizing", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "A Mississippi wedding venue that refused to serve an interracial couple has apologized in the face of backlash over its discriminatory policy.\n\nA woman believed to be the owner of Boone\u2019s Camp Event Hall in Booneville, Mississippi was recently captured on video explaining why the venue was unwilling to accommodate gay and interracial couples.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we don\u2019t do gay weddings or mixed race \u2014 because of our Christian race, I mean, our Christian belief,\u201d the woman says in the now-viral video. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue my faith,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just don\u2019t participate.\u201d\n\nThe video \u2014 which was posted by 24-year-old LaKambria Welch and first reported by the website Deep South Voice on Sunday \u2014 quickly sparked backlash, prompting an apology on the Boone\u2019s Camp Event Hall Facebook page. (The page has since been deleted.)\n\nWelch\u2019s original video post appears to have been deleted as well, but she told the Washington Post that she traveled to the event hall to get answers after the owner told her brother, who is black, and his fianc\u00e9e, who is white, that the venue could no longer accommodate their nuptials.\n\n\u201cWhen she explained that she doesn\u2019t do the two specific type of weddings, I felt myself starting to shake,\u201d Welch told the Post. \u201cJust hearing it gave me chills.\u201d\n\nCivil rights advocates criticized the event hall for discrimination.\n\n\u201cReligion should never be exploited as a license to discriminate,\u201d Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a tweet. \u201cThis incident is yet another glaring example of how white supremacy and anti-LGBTQ bigotry are not merely things of the past. We must take action against these blatantly illegal practices.\u201d\n\nIn a statement posted on its Facebook page, the City of Booneville said city leaders \u201cdo not condone or approve these types of discriminatory policies.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Mississippi passed a controversial law allowing businesses to refuse services to LGBTQ people based on religious objections. That means the venue\u2019s refusal to host weddings for gay couples, based on religious beliefs, is protected by state law.\n\nBut the law does not address race or ethnicity, and the landmark 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Loving v. Virginia, made interracial marriage legal across the United States. Under federal law, it\u2019s illegal to discriminate on the basis of race in public accommodations.\n\nOpponents of religious-exemption laws \u2014 like Mississippi\u2019s \u2014 have long argued they could be used to enable discrimination on the basis of race. As NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill noted, historical objections to interracial marriage and integration were often grounded in religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe conduct in this video is illegal,\u201d Ifill said on Twitter. \u201cA reminder that battles won long ago are being reignited.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether this incident could result in legal action. In a statement provided to the New York Times, Boone\u2019s Camp Event Hall said they had invited the couple back to use the venue, but Welch told the Times her brother had been already contacted by many other event spaces.\n\nIn the apology that briefly appeared on the Boone\u2019s Camp Event Hall Facebook page, according to screen shots captured before it was deleted, the venue\u2019s owner said she had studied the Bible, spoken to her pastor in recent days and learned her belief about interracial marriages was \u201cincorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have, for many years, stood firm on my Christian faith not knowing that biracial relationships were NEVER mentioned in The Bible!\u201d the post said. \u201cAll of the years I had \u2018assumed\u2019 in my mind that I was correct, but have never taken the opportunity to research and find whether this was correct or incorrect until now.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo all those offended, hurt or felt condemn by my statement I truly apologize to you for my ignorance in not knowing the truth about this,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "A Mississippi wedding venue that refused to serve an interracial couple apologized in the face of backlash over its discriminatory policy", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/interracial-wedding-discrimination.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
