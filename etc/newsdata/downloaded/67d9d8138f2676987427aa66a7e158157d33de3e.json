The city was to clean the statue and have police investigate who the vandals are\n\nIt was the fourth time the statue has been vandalized since 2010, and similarly to the targeted vandalism of other statues of the 15th century explorer in other cities over the years.\n\nStatues of Columbus were last covered in red paint in Chicago and New York in 2017. That was the same year the statue in Providence was last defaced.\n\nAt the time, Brown University, also in Providence, voted to rename the Ivy League school's 'Fall Weekend,' 'Indigenous Peoples' Day. In New York, a study group also was commissioned to consider renaming Columbus Circle at the junction of 59th Street, Broadway and 8th Avenues.\n\nAt the heart of the modern-day controversy over Columbus for several years has been whether to celebrate him for being a brave explorer, or to shun him for opening the way for other Europeans to come to the Americas, setting in motion what critics say was decades of genocide of indigenous people.\n\nTV journalist Kainani tweeted images of the last time the Columbus statue in Providence was vandalized in 2017. Statues of Columbus were Chicago and New York were covered in red paint that same year\n\n'He put his life on the line, his ships on the line,' Donald Angelo of the Rhode Island Order Sons of Italy in America previously told The Journal.\n\nColumbus is heralded for setting out across the unknown perils of sailing the Atlantic ocean at the time, and staying the course until he arrived in the Americas on October 12, 1492. 'That says something about him,' Angelo told the Journal.\n\nOthers, however, point to Viking explorer Leif Erikson for arriving long before the Italian.\n\nErikson, the son of Erik the Red, founder of the first European settlement on what became Greenland, is said to have sailed off course on his way back to Greenland and landed in North America in a region he called Vinland around around 1000 AD, four centuries before Columbus's arrival, according to History.com.\n\nThere are critics who additionally point out that Columbus actually landed in the Caribbean and not in North America.\n\nThe majority of protests have come from those who cannot overlook the scores of indigenous people killed when Europeans followed Columbus to the New World, and who also died from the spread of diseases brought over from the old that they were not immune to.\n\nCritics point to Viking explorer Leif Erikson for arriving long before Columbus to the Americas. An artist's rendering shows a Viking ship carrying Erikson on his trip to discover the New World around 1,000 AD, four centuries before Columbus\n\n'We don't celebrate Columbus Day,' Darrell Waldron, executive director of the Rhode Island Indian Council, told the Journal last year. He considered Columbus a harbinger of catastrophe, who opened a door to an invasion that destroyed his ancestors' societies.\n\nThe day celebrating the explorer in the US remains a federal holiday, although some states have acted on efforts to rename the day in memory of indigenous people.\n\nMaine made the switch in April, to honor Native Americans, while Oklahoma opted to celebrate both explorer and indigenous people at the same time.\n\nMaine's Democratic Governor Janet Mills at the time said 'there is power in a name and who we choose to honor,' before signing a law that dropped the state's recognition of the federal holiday.\n\nVermont, New Mexico, Alaska, South Dakota, Oregon, Minnesota and Hawaii have also replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples' Day.", "description": "Vandals again splashed red paint on a statue of Christopher Columbus in Providence, Rhode Island, on the national holiday for the fourth time and left a sign demanding 'stop celebrating genocide'", "authors": ["Ralph R.
