Saturday\u2019s game in Yokohama decides who wins the pool.\n\nCoach Eddie Jones has been questioned over how much he\u2019s played Vunipola recently. Vunipola has started all England\u2019s games at the Rugby World Cup, although he came off at halftime against the Pumas having received treatment on his ankle on the field.\n\nEngland also has injury concerns over prop Joe Marler and back Jack Nowell - just \u201cniggles\u201d according to Mitchell - while captain Owen Farrell and hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie have been ill.\n\nThe England-France game could be one of a number affected if Super Typhoon Hagibis hits Japan, as feared, this weekend.\n\nMitchell says England hasn\u2019t given much thought to the typhoon: \u201cWe don\u2019t let that noise enter our preparation.\u201d\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nMathieu Raynal of France is ill and has withdrawn from refereeing the Pool A match between Scotland and Russia in Shizuoka.

Four more are set for Sunday, the final day of the preliminary round.\n\n\u201cWe are currently monitoring the development of a typhoon off the south coast of Japan in partnership with our weather information experts,\u201d World Rugby said in a statement. \u201cIt is still too early to determine what, if any, impact there will be on match or training activities.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, New Zealand plays Italy, England takes on France and Ireland plays Samoa at Fukuoka, which is situated on the north shore of Kyushu Island and appears to be the match most threatened by the typhoon.\n\nClear and sunny skies are expected at all three venues on Wednesday, when Argentina plays the United States at Kumagaya near Tokyo, Scotland takes on Russia at Shizuoka and Wales plays Fiji at Oita.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Latest on Day 20 at the Rugby World Cup (all times local):", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
