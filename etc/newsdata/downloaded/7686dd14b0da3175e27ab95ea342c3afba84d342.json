Boone said his catcher has been \u201cexcellent\u201d defensively, and he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to start the two-time All-Star against the Houston Astros.\n\nNew York lost to Houston 4-1 on Tuesday to fall behind 2-1 in the series. One of the Astros\u2019 runs scored when S\u00e1nchez couldn\u2019t get in front of a wild fastball from left-hander Zack Britton with a man on third base, a play that prompted a lot of criticism from Yankees fans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been excellent behind the plate from a game-calling standpoint, from a game-plan target, receiving,\u201d Boone said. \u201cA lot of people are making a lot of the block. There\u2019s a lot of 94 mph fastballs that guys don\u2019t block. Guys aren\u2019t always set up to block a fastball. That\u2019s kind of a 50/50 play.\u201d\n\nOften maligned for his glovework in the early stages of his career, the 26-year-old S\u00e1nchez has become a star because of his dangerous bat. That stick has gone silent this postseason. He\u2019s 2 for 21 without an RBI in October after missing much of September with left groin soreness - a recurring problem this season.\n\n\u201cI feel like Gary has been back long enough now to certainly be in the flow and the rhythm of regular play,\u201d Boone said. \u201cAgain, hopefully this starts real soon for him.\u201d\n\nYankees pitchers have praised S\u00e1nchez\u2019s defense this postseason. Reliever Adam Ottavino said he was impressed with S\u00e1nchez\u2019s work behind the plate in his first season with the Yankees.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s been a narrative about his catching,\u201d Ottavino said. \u201cI thought he\u2019s been pretty awesome the whole year.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven last year, I was pleasantly surprised,\u201d echoed Britton. \u201cI had heard a lot of negative things about him. I didn\u2019t find any of it to be true. I thought he was a really good catcher, actually, has a good feel for game calling.\u201d\n\nAdvanced defensive metrics have generally graded S\u00e1nchez well, giving him above-average marks for pitch framing over his career. There\u2019s never been any question about his throwing arm.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is his body of work in this postseason, and frankly down the stretch in the second half of the season defensively, has been excellent,\u201d Boone said. \u201cSo that part has me feeling really good about him. And just knowing how talented of an offensive player he is, I always feel like he\u2019s a pitch away or an at-bat away from really getting locked in and changing the course of a game.\n\n\u201cSo clearly he hasn\u2019t been at his best offensively but with a guy as talented as he is, I think that\u2019s right around the corner always.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yankees manager Aaron Boone wasn't sure Wednesday what his lineup for the next day's Game 4 of the AL Championship Series would look like.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Seiner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_28085_c0-92-2200-1375_s1200x700.jpg?db3a8e064c95f36609fc0650b98ffcd6dd99cd28", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
