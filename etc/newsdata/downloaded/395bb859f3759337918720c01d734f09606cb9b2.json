good for workers as well as helping to meet international climate change targets to keep global temperature rises below 1.5C.\n\n\u201cThis report makes a major contribution to Labour\u2019s plans to kickstart a green industrial revolution,\u201d said Ms Long Bailey.\n\n\u201cThe Labour Party has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world and is the only party turning their targets into detailed, credible plans to tackle the climate and environmental crisis.\n\n\u201cInaction on climate by Conservative and Lib Dem coalition governments has led to a lost decade in the race to cut emissions from our energy system.\n\n\u201cThe recommendations in this report could put the UK on track for a zero-carbon energy system during the 2030\u2019s \u2013 but only if rapid progress is made early on. The next five years are therefore crucial.\n\n\u201cWe are working with trade unions to ensure that the changes to our energy system will be planned democratically, with the interests of workers and local communities at the heart of the transition.\u201d\n\nThe 30 by 2030 report identified four key goals to transform the UK\u2019s energy supply and use:\n\n- Reducing energy waste in buildings and industry;\n\n- Decarbonising heat;\n\n- Boosting renewable and low carbon electricity generation; and\n\n- Balancing the UK\u2019s supply and demand.\n\nIt found that the public health consequences of cutting emissions could save the NHS \u00a3400 million a year, including by avoiding 6,200 respiratory-related deaths a year by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy.\n\nResponding to the report, GMB national secretary Justin Bowden said: \u201cThis report is a serious attempt from Labour to work with trade unions to create a practical plan rooted in the real world.\n\n\u201cWith 24 million homes in the UK heated by gas, recognising and supporting the essential role for ultra-low carbon green hydrogen gas keeps Labour in touch with ordinary working people.\n\n\u201cA plan to tackle climate change that not only meets the country\u2019s future energy needs but will create quality jobs, whilst ensuring the costs of any green revolution are not loaded onto household energy bills but paid for by corporations and through progressive general taxation, is far more than anything any Tory government has ever offered.\u201d", "description": "An area of the UK the size of 22,000 football pitches could be carpeted with solar panels under an expert plan commissioned by Labour to help meet its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
