General Michael Flynn, filed a court motion on Monday disclosing the phones\u2019 existence while tying them to Western intelligence.\n\nShe told The Washington Times on Thursday that she has confirmed that it was Mr. Durham\u2019s office who obtained them.\n\nWilliam Barr assigned Mr. Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, the mission of finding out the origins of the FBI\u2019s counter-intelligence investigation known as Crossfire Hurricane. She told the Times that a \u201csource,\u201d whom she declined to identify, told her about the BlackBerrys.\n\nMr. Mifsud, a university professor and well-traveled lecturer, told George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, in London in April 2016 that Moscow owned thousands of Hillary Clinton emails. When the news reached the FBI in July, agent Peter Strzok initiated the probe.\n\nThe FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller have always contended that Mr. Mifsud was a Russian asset. Mr. Mueller\u2019s final report made no mention of the numerous associations Mr. Mifsud maintained with Western diplomats and intelligence figures.\n\nMr. Papadopoulos contends Mr. Mifsud was a Western agent sent to entrap him.\n\nBy the spring of 2016, the FBI knew that Russian intelligence was hacking Democratic Party computers.\n\nMs. Powell has added to the Mifsud intrigue with her motion before District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan asking him to order the government to turn over the BlackBerrys\u2019 data. The filing lists the two phones\u2019 model number, PIN and SIM card information.\n\nShe told the judge that on Oct. 11 she asked the prosecution for phone data. She was ignored until she sent notification days later that she planned to file the discovery motion.\n\nThe motion says: \u201cMichael T. Flynn requests the government be ordered to produce evidence that has only recently come into its possession\u2026\u2026\u2026 This information is material, exculpatory, and relevant to the defense of Mr. Flynn, and specifically to the \u201cOCONUS LURES\u201d and agents that western intelligence tasked against him likely as early as 2014 to arrange\u2014unbeknownst to him\u2014\u2018connections\u2019 with certain Russians that they would then use against him in their false claims. The phones were used by Mr. Joseph Mifsud.\u201d\n\n\u201cOCONUS LURES\u201d is a FBI acronym for an operation to lure a person back to the U.S.\n\nFlynn headed the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence Agency until the Obama White House forced his retirement in August 2014 over disagreements on fighting Islamic extremists.\n\nFlynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser in early 2017, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents, including Mr. Strzok, about discussions he had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.\n\nIt did not relate to election interference. No Trump associated was ever charged in a Russian conspiracy which Mr. Mueller said he didn\u2019t find.\n\nMs. Powell has been filing motions demanding the government turn over exculpatory evidence. She wants to show it was withheld early on, violating Judge Sullivan\u2019s order.\n\nReacting to the BlackBerry disclosure, Mr. Papadopoulos tweeted: \u201cI lived this spy story. The government\u2019s of the UK, Australia, Italy sent their agents: Mifsud, Downer, Halper, Azra Turk and many more. With the new info on Mifsud\u2019s phones with the DOJ, my story was the one that exposed the greatest spying scandal in history. Downer is next!\u201d\n\nAlexander Downer was the Australian ambassador in London to whom Mr. Papadopoulos relayed the Mifsud gossip. Mr. Downer denies he was a spy. Stephan Halper and Azar Turk were FBI/western intelligence spies assigned to Mr. Papadopoulos in London.\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec declined to comment on the Flynn motion.\n\nWhen news broke that Mr. Durham was in Rome, she released a statement:\n\n\u201cAs the Department of Justice has previously announced, a team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is investigating the origins of the U.S. counterintelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr\u2019s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials.\u201d\n\nMr. Mifsud taught at Link University in Rome. Students included NATO personnel.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
