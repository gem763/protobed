Photo: HBO\n\nIn 2019 we reached the end of Game of Thrones, finishing an eight-year saga spanning seven kingdoms, three dragons (that we know of), and too many stabbings and beheadings to count. In the weeks leading up to the finale there was much wringing of hands over how it marked the end of the monoculture, the final iteration of a time when we all, I don\u2019t know, gathered around in our sunken living rooms with our TV dinners to watch M*A*S*H, or something. The flip side of all this talk of fragmentation, though, is that we\u2019re still very much in an age of serialization and franchise juggernauts, so it made absolute sense when HBO announced that multiple spinoffs would vie to fill the Wun Wun\u2013size hole in our hearts after Game of Thrones ended. So take comfort in knowing that at least one new series is coming \u2014 even though HBO nixed several others \u2014 and regardless of whether or not GOT stuck the landing (it didn\u2019t), we don\u2019t have to say good-bye to George R.R. Martin\u2019s world. So let\u2019s put on our Samwell hats and lay out everything we know about the post\u2013Game of Thrones\u2013iverse so far.\n\nThe Fire & Blood adaptation is happening, and it will be called House of the Dragon.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, George R.R. Martin released the 800-page companion book Fire & Blood, which covers Targaryen history going back to the conquest of Westeros, 300 years before the events of the television series. Martin remains enamored with the Targaryens, and in a May blog post wrote about the upcoming series in development: \u201cWhat are they about? I cannot say. But maybe some of you should pick up a copy of Fire & Blood and come up with your own theories.\u201d Then, on October 29, HBO gave a ten-episode direct-to-series order to a Fire & Blood adaptation that will be called House of the Dragon. The series will be co-created by Martin and Colony creator and showrunner Ryan Condal. Condal will serve as co-showrunner alongside \u201cBattle of the Bastards\u201d and \u201cWinds of Winter\u201d director Miguel Sapochnik.\n\nNaomi Watts\u2019s pilot is a no-go for HBO.\n\nPrior to the House of the Dragon announcement, it seemed like the first post-GOT project we\u2019d actually get to see would be one helmed by Jane Goldman and co-written by Martin, which filmed its pilot this past summer. HBO ordered the pilot in 2018, and later that year we learned that the series would star Naomi Watts as a \u201ccharismatic socialite with a dark secret\u201d and take place around 10,000 years before the events of Game of Thrones, near the end of the Age of Heroes. This series was one of many initially announced with women at the helm. Back in September when rumors about the Fire & Blood series were spreading, Martin wrote on his blog: \u201cSome websites are suggesting that the news about Ryan\u2019s show moving forward means that Jane\u2019s show won\u2019t. If that\u2019s so, no one has told me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so.\u201d In October, however, Goldman sent emails to the cast and crew to tell them that the pilot would not be moving forward. It would seem it was, in fact, so. According to Deadline, this news comes \u201cafter a lengthy post-production, which included re-editing of the initial cut after it was not well received, and rumors about issues during filming in Northern Ireland.\u201d What kind of world are we living in, where people can treat Naomi Watts like this? HBO has yet to comment.\n\nHBO has had as many as five series in development.\n\nIn 2017, HBO announced that it had begun the process of developing \u201cmultiple possible spinoffs\u201d for Game of Thrones, and by the end of the year, there were five in development. According to a September update on George R.R. Martin\u2019s blog, \u201cin these days of a hundred networks, channels, and streaming services, I think television has plenty of room for two shows set in Westeros \u2026 or hell, maybe three or four \u2026 I still want to do SPEARCARRIERS, after all.\u201d That last bit, by the way, is a reference to a show Martin wants to make that would be the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead to the original Game of Thrones series. Hey, if it worked for Lion King 1 \u00bd.\n\nBryan Cogman\u2019s spinoff is off.\n\nLater in 2017, Entertainment Weekly reported that there was a fifth Game of Thrones prequel in the works at HBO, this one led by GOT co-executive producer Bryan Cogman, one of the show\u2019s most prolific writers, having penned more episodes than George R.R. Martin. Martin blogged his excitement, adding that he would personally work on the project alongside Cogman. But in April 2019, Cogman admitted that HBO passed on the pitch and said, \u201cSo it is a good-bye. I am done with Westeros.\u201d\n\nWhatever we get, they\u2019ll likely all be prequels.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin remains deeply interested in the fictional history of Westeros, so it seems highly likely that whatever new series we do eventually get will take place before the events of Thrones. So this is almost certainly the end of the Kingsroad for the show\u2019s characters.\n\nSorry, probably no Robert\u2019s Rebellion.\n\nIf news of Game of Thrones prequels sparks visions of \u201cRob and Ned\u2019s Excellent Adventure,\u201d don\u2019t hold your breath. As early as 2013, George R.R. Martin stated that while he would be interested in writing a prequel about Westeros, \u201cI don\u2019t think, however, it would be a prequel about Robert\u2019s Rebellion.\u201d\n\nStill, there is plenty of source material.\n\nIn addition to dreaming of Robert\u2019s Rebellion, fans have long hoped for an adaptation of Martin\u2019s Tales of Dunk and Egg series of novellas, which tell the story of hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall and his trusty squire Egg, a boyhood nickname for (SPOILER ALERT!) King Aegon Targaryen the Fifth (Dany\u2019s great-grandfather, if I read the family tree correctly). These stories take place around 90 years before the events of Game of Thrones. Writers might also draw from The World of Ice & Fire, Martin\u2019s 2014 Westerosi history book that covers the backstories of everything from the great houses to the Age of Heroes.\n\nOne more thing: Don\u2019t call them spinoffs.\n\nIn a post to his personal blog earlier this year, Martin confessed, \u201cI mislike the term \u2018spinoffs.\u2019\u201d Instead, Martin\u2019s devised a term for the new series that perfectly fits with his universe\u2019s themes of royalty and bloodlines: They\u2019re called \u201csuccessor shows,\u201d sweetie. Get it right.", "description": "HBO has had as many as five \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spinoffs in development, including the newly confirmed \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d series and the recently scrapped pilot starring Naomi Watts.
