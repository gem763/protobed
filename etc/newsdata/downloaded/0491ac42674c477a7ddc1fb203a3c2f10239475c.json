This always-on face shows them all day. Todd Haselton | CNBC\n\nDevoted Health, a start-up health insurer targeting seniors with its private Medicare plans, says it is the first to offer Apple Watch as a fitness benefit to its members. Devoted, which was founded by brothers and serial entrepreneurs Todd and Ed Park, is attempting to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded market of Medicare Advantage plans through its focus on \"world class technology,\" according to its website. Devoted was valued at $1.8 billion when it raised $300 million about a year ago. The company will offer up to $150 off the cost of an Apple Watch for its members. More than 20 million Americans over the age of 65, and growing, are currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage program. These plans, which are run by private companies, are approved by Medicare to cover seniors' health, typically with more flexibility and a broader array of benefits. Overall, the market is expected to generate more than $350 billion in annual revenue by 2020, according to the consulting firm PwC. For Apple, working with Medicare Advantage plans offers a big potential boost to device sales because seniors are increasingly adopting smartphone technologies and therefore might be interested in a smartwatch. Apple has been courting this population by introducing features and services that are intended to be beneficial to older users, such as fall detection and heart health monitoring. Moreover, Medicare Advantage plans have more of an incentive to embrace consumer-facing technologies as they tend to retain members for longer than commercial plans, and are therefore looking for ways to invest in members' long-term health and wellbeing. Wearables are still a nascent technology, and studies are underway to assess whether they are moving the needle on healthy outcomes. But for these plans, offering Apple Watches as a fitness benefit might be a way to sign up and retain members interested in staying active later in life, where there are proven benefits to healthy eating and exercise.\n\nHow it will work\n\nApple has been talking to plans like Devoted for months, as CNBC previously reported, about subsidizing the cost of Apple Watch. It is also working with commercial insurers, like Aetna, as well as life insurers such as John Hancock, as part of their programs to help members access an Apple Watch. For Devoted Health members, the subsidy will go a long way towards covering the cost of a device. The Apple Watch Series 3 is now available for $199, and later versions sell for $349 and up. Devoted just updated its marketing materials to show that it will cover $150 per year in cost for \"wellness bucks for classes, programs, and wearable devices like an Apple Watch.\" Wellness Bucks, according to the company's marketing materials, involve a reimbursement up to that amount to the member for the purchase of the device, and/ or participation in fitness classes or weight loss programs. Those who do not have a smartphone can opt for the fitness class, rather than the Apple Watch, which is a more commonly-offered benefit. Apple declined to comment on its collaboration with Devoted. In a statement, a spokesperson for Devoted Health said the company is moving to give its members \"the tools they need to keep healthy outside of the doctor's office.\" \"We are pleased that CMS agrees that there is a wide variety of ways that older Americans can keep healthy, including fitness and nutrition classes, and activity monitoring devices such as the Apple Watch,\" said Devoted Health spokesman Kenneth Baer. \"We are thrilled to be the first Medicare Advantage plan to collaborate with Apple, and give our members the chance to use their Devoted Health Wellness bucks towards purchasing an Apple Watch. Using innovative technologies to improve the quality of care is core to our mission.\"\n\nOther plans following suit", "description": "Devoted Health says it is the first Medicare Advantage plan to offer Apple Watch as a fitness benefit, allowing members to put $150 towards the cost of the device.", "authors": ["Christina Farr"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106133959-1568728815193apple-watch-11.jpg?v=1568728920", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
