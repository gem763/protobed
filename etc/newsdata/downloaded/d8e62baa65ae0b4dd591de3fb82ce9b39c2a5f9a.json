B. Yeats, another Irish doyen of modernist literature, was repatriated to Ireland in 1948 after dying in France in 1939.", "description": "Dublin (AFP) \u2013 A group of Dubliners are campaigning to bring home the remains of celebrated author James Joyce, whose grave in Zurich is far from", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/5a1844_sculpture-depicting-james-joyce-his-grave-in-fluntern-cemetery-in-zurich-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
