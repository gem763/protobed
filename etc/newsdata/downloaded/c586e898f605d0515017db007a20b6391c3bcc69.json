Add United Kingdom as an interest to stay up to date on the latest United Kingdom news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nCameron told the BBC that he felt \"panic\" that the pro-secession side might win, and told the queen's private secretary that \"just a raising of the eyebrow, even, you know, a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a difference.\"\n\nThe queen is expected to stay out of politics and rarely makes her personal views public. So she surprised many when she told well-wishers days before the referendum that Scots should \"think very carefully about the future\" before voting.\n\nThat was seen by some as a call for Scotland to remain part of the U.K.\n\nThe pro-remain side won the vote by 55% to 45%.\n\n\"I didn't ask for anything improper to be said or done\" by the queen, Cameron said.\n\nThe then-prime minister was criticized when he was recorded saying after the referendum that the queen had \"purred down the line\" when he called to tell her the news.\n\nCameron said he had \"nothing more to say\" about the matter.\n\n\"I've already said perhaps a little bit too much,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe 93-year-old queen has been dragged back into politics through a Supreme Court challenge to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks as the Brexit deadline approaches.\n\nOpponents of the government claim the suspension was illegal, and accuse the prime minister of misleading the queen, whose formal approval was needed for the move.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
