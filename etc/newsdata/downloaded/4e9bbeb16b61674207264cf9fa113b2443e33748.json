It might be hard to precisely define, but \u2014 and to paraphrase former United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart \u2014 we know it when we see it.\n\nLet\u2019s give an example. A new monitor that costs like triple the amount of its competitors? That\u2019s very \u2018Apple.\u2019 An experimental dual-screen phone that folds up like a clamshell (and probably will be an ass ache to use)? Not very \u2018Apple\u2019 at all.\n\nMakes sense right? You can feel it.\n\nNow, considering Apple has just released macOS Catalina \u2014 its latest operating system \u2014 we all know there\u2019s only one thing to do: rank its biggest features by how \u2018Apple\u2018 they are. Strap yourselves in, this is gonna get messy\n\nAs \u2018Apple\u2019 as a black turtleneck tucked into some blue jeans: Mac Catalyst\n\nBasically, Mac Catalyst allows iPad apps to be easily ported to your Apple computer. Not a bad idea, right? But it\u2019s so totally fucking \u2018Apple\u2018 I think it\u2019s going to cover me in glass and add \u201cPro\u201d to my name.\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s pretty cool. Secondly, it\u2019s not a particularly new idea, as you\u2019ve been able to do this with Android apps and Chromebooks for a while. In other words, that\u2019s \u2018Apple\u2018 on both counts.\n\nBut, there\u2019s another reason why this is the most \u2018Apple\u2018 update of macOS Catalina. I truly believe Apple wants to create The One Operating System To Rule Them All, and merge all of its software into a single entity. And this is a great start to that.\n\nJust wait and tell me I\u2019m wrong. Trust me, if Mr. Tim Apple has anything to say about it, all our computers will be iPads in 2030. You heard it here first.\n\nAlso pretty damn \u2018Apple\u2019: The long overdue introduction of window resizing\n\nAhhh at long last\n\nThis feature has been on Windows in some form for an absolute age. But macOS users? Well, they\u2019ve had to use apps like Magnet to do the job. But now they can easily resize windows on macOS Catalina without the need for a third party app.\n\nThis, friends, is really fucking \u2018Apple.\u2019\n\nThink of it this way: Apple leaves a basic feature out of its operating system for years. This leads to a small company creating a thriving business around fixing that flaw. All is rosy. Until Apple introduces the long overdue feature, effectively crushing the plucky upstart that made its machines actually usable over the last few years.\n\nWe may as well call the new feature iWindow iResizing.\n\nSlightly less \u2018Apple,\u2019 but still pretty \u2018Apple\u2019 when you think about it: Sidecar\n\nNow you just need to bankrupt yourself buying both a MacBook and an iPad.\n\nBasically, Sidecar turns your iPad into a second display by either extending or mirroring your computer\u2019s desktop. This was a tough one to place, but, after long and careful consideration, I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s pretty, but not totally, \u2018Apple.\u2019\n\nThe feature should\u2019ve been possible with the iPad since\u2026 forever. I mean, a tablet is basically just souped-up screen anyway, right? So far, so \u2018Apple.\u2019\n\nOf course, this feature is only useful if you have both an iPad and a macOS computer \u2014 making it even more \u2018Apple.\u2019 But, it loses a few points because I haven\u2019t seen any other hardware makers offer the same feature (although there are lots of third party apps that do it), meaning this is actually pretty new, so not that \u2018Apple.\u2019\n\nNeither very or not very \u2018Apple\u2019: New accessibility features\n\nRemember, this list isn\u2019t about what\u2019s good or bad, it\u2019s all about how \u2018Apple\u2018 something is. If we were using the previous metric then the new accessibility features would be high up the list.\n\nSo, macOS Catalina includes three new accessibility updates: voice control, a zoom display, and hover text features. This makes using macOS for people with disabilities far easier and more comfortable. And that\u2019s great.\n\nBut I believe it\u2019s dead in the center of \u2018Apple-ness.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t come in a metal unibody, which means it\u2019s not very \u2018Apple.\u2019 But it\u2019s also well designed and thought-out, so very \u2018Apple\u2018 \u2014 meaning it\u2019s bang in the middle.\n\nNot that \u2018Apple\u2019 if I\u2019m being honest: Screen Time\n\nScreen Time? More like\u2026 SCREAM TIME, AMIRITE?!?!?\n\nUgh, not only is Screen Time BORING (I mean, who really cares how long they spend on their computer? Yeah, I know it\u2019s not healthy, but I both work and relax on my computer \u2014 and it\u2019s not like I have much else to do \u2014 so stop trying to shame me for my terrible life choices; I\u2019m aware of how pathetic I am already thank you very much), which means it\u2019s not that \u2018Apple.\u2019\n\nNormally the company makes interesting products, or, at the very least, things that are enjoyable to make fun of. Which is basically the same. This is just bleak.\n\nNot very \u2018Apple\u2019 at all: Death of iTunes\n\nUgh, I\u2019m so sad about the demise of iTunes on macOS Catalina. I loved that damn software.\n\nOn one hand, you could look at the release of separate apps as a very \u2018Apple\u2018 move (THERE\u2019S AN APP FOR EVERYTHING LOL), but because this is my list, I make the decisions. It\u2019s not very \u2018Apple.\u2019\n\nUnlike Google, Apple doesn\u2019t kill off that much stuff. Evidence? Hell, the company is still selling a version of the iPod, even though the whole line has been effectively discontinued.\n\nSo, to see them put down something as iconic and well known as iTunes doesn\u2019t seem that \u2018Apple\u2018 at all. Does the move make sense? Yeah, I can totally see why the company murdered iTunes. But decisions based on logic don\u2019t seem very \u2018Apple\u2018 at all.\n\nSo far away from \u2018Apple,\u2019 you can\u2019t even call it fruit: Apple Arcade\n\nHonestly, Apple Arcade is the least \u2018Apple\u2018 thing I\u2019ve seen the company create in years. As much as I love tech giant (ugh, I\u2019m the worst), I\u2019d rarely describe them as good value \u2014 which is exactly what Apple Arcade is.\n\nWhile they make great products, the very definition of \u2018Apple\u2018 is removing a headphone jack from a mobile phone, and then selling you a dongle so you can plug your headphones into that mobile phone.\n\nApple Arcade is not like that. For $5 a month you get access to an ever-growing library of games (there are currently over 100) across all your Apple devices. And these aren\u2019t shitty, third-party remakes of Bejeweled \u2014 many of these titles are developed specifically for Apple Arcade.\n\nThat, friends, is good value.\n\nBoth reviews and people I\u2019ve spoken to about Apple Arcade have been glowing. Which, and let\u2019s be honest here, isn\u2019t a normal response to most Apple products. What could be less \u2018Apple\u2018 than that?\n\nSo, there you have it, a definitive ranking of the most to least \u2018Apple\u2018 feature of macOS Catalina.
