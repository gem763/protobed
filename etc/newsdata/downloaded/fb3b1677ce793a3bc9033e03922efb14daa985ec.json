Garner's dying words, \"I can't breathe,\" became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA police sergeant who responded to the scene gave up 20 days of vacation time to settle her disciplinary case.\n\nLondon had earlier said he would use legal appeals to try to get the officer reinstated. He has insisted the officer used a reasonable amount of force and did not mean to hurt Garner.\n\nThe Sergeants Benevolent Association tweeted Tuesday that Pantaleo \"never should of been fired! He was scapegoated by a cowardice police commissioner,\"\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton blasted the lawsuit, saying Pantaleo \"had a fair administrative trial\" that recommended his dismissal .\n\n\"Pantaleo's decision to seek his reinstatement is not only disrespectful to the Police Commissioner and NYPD, but also the Garner family,\" Sharpton said in a statement. \"He has shown no contrition or acknowledgment of his violent actions that ultimately killed Eric Garner.\"\n\nIn an amateur video, New York Police Dept. officers use a choke hold on Eric Garner as they detain him for selling unlicensed cigarettes on a Staten Island, N.Y. street in July 2014. Garner died shortly afterward. CBS 2\n\nCBS New York notes that Sharpton added, \"If Pantaleo's case goes to trial, the National Action Network, Black clergy members, and civil rights leaders will pack the courts while wearing neck braces to show solidarity in our fight for justice for the Garner family and victims of police brutality. And if Pantaleo wins this lawsuit, he will continue to pose a threat to all Black and Brown people in New York City.\"\n\nAfter Garner's death, the police department required all 36,000 officers to undergo three days of training, including classes focused on de-escalation. It also began training officers on fair and impartial policing, teaching them to recognize biases and rely on facts, not racial stereotypes.", "description": "Daniel Pantaleo was canned in August for applying chokehold in 2014 that resulted in death of Garner; it also helped spark Black Lives Matter movement", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/13/d4a05ea6-0d70-4dfa-9b49-76def071375b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/abe17a8a56debbdbceb8ad31c0a66323/ap-19133427714047.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
