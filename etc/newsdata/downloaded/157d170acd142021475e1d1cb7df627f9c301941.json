The International Olympic Committee resisted change to protect the value of the official sponsor deals that fund sports and the games.\n\nAfter a German federal agency ruled in February that Rule 40 was \"too far-reaching ... abusive conduct,\" the IOC said national Olympic bodies could oversee new athlete agreements.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic Committee's agreement this month includes now also letting athletes thank their sponsors.\n\n\"There cannot be anything in the advertising that makes that (Olympic) connection,\" Chambers said, beyond the fact that the athlete featured in a commercial would be competing in Tokyo around the same time.\n\nThe two-day ANOC meeting in Qatar also addressed the charter's Rule 50 that prohibits athletes from making political statements in Olympic venues.\n\nIn recent months, there were medal podium protests at the swimming world championships and the Pan-American Games.\n\nSwimmers from Britain and Australia drew attention to Chinese rival Sun Yang, who is involved in a doping case.
