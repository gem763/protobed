Danu Rizky Fadilla, a 22-year-old at the State University of Jakarta, said the internet was key in mobilising student support against the proposed laws.\n\n\u201cI think the internet now has been inseparable with student movements,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is inherent to student movements, with the hashtags, posts, and petitions.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, just before the protests started, social media was filled with to-do lists for students who were planning to protest. Photos shared on Twitter ranged from how to wear masks in the event of tear gas being fired, to bringing your own \u201creusable\u201d water bottles and to dress for the heat.\n\nHashtags dominating social media this week included #ReformasiDikorupsi (or #reformcorrupted), which Ismail Fahmi, founder of big data consultancy Drone Emprit, said was tweeted about 300,000 times.\n\nREFORM, CROWDFUNDING\n\n\u201cReformasi\u201d (Reform) was the battlecry for activists during the anti-Suharto protests, which ultimately paved the way for his ouster and the restoration of democracy and press freedom. This week, a list of student demands was circulated on social media, which alongside opposing the new laws included stopping forest fires and removing a heavy military presence in the restive easternmost area of Papua.\n\nThe protesters also raised money on crowdfunding platform Kitabisa.com, collecting around 175 million rupiah ($12,300) before donations ended.\n\n\u201cWe used the money to supply ambulances, food, and \u2018Komando\u2019 cars,\u201d said activist Ananda Badudu, referring to pickup trucks packed with protesters.\n\nSome Indonesian students sought inspiration from Hong Kong\u2019s anti-government protesters, posting articles and videos showing tactics to deal with the Hong Kong police, as they fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannon.\n\nA video of techniques to deal with tear gas translated into Bahasa on Tuesday evening quickly went viral on social media, receiving more than 1 million views, with captions ranging from \u201cCan be copied!\u201d to \u201cTips from Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSome Hong Kong protesters responded with messages of support for Indonesian students, calling for them to stand together.\n\nAlex, a student activist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told Reuters he learned about the Indonesian movement on Twitter, and said he was now posting hashtags to encourage solidarity. He declined to give his surname.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nIn a popular tweet, Alex posted a photo of folded paper birds, one decked out in the red and white of the Indonesian flag, while the other mimicked Hong Kong protesters\u2019 multi-colored Post-it \u201cLennon Walls\u201d.\n\nIn the comments, Indonesians thanked him, while he replied in Bahasa, \u201cTetap kuat\u201d (Stay strong).\n\nHe said he used Google Translate to find the words.", "description": "Indonesian students who took to the streets this week to block new laws they feared would threaten hard-won reforms mobilised amid a flurry of online activity that included tips and advice from pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Stanley Widianto", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434513546&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0TC", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
