The BBC reported that Abqaiq, the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, was struck first and a second drone attack started fires in the nearby Khurais oilfield.\n\nA spokesman for the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks, according to the BBC.\n\nHouthi fighters were previously blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month and Iran was blamed by Saudi Arabia and the US for attacks on two oil tankers in June and July, which authorities in Tehran denied.\n\nThe kingdom produces 9.8 million barrels of crude oil a day. The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility that can process 7% of the global supply.\n\nAramco officials have suggested the company could be worth as much as $2 trillion.\n\nAhead of the attack, it was reported that the state-run oil giant was planning to list as much as 5% of its shares sometime in 2020 or 2021. If Aramco were to list 5% of its shares at a $2 trillion valuation, it could raise as much $100 billion through the offering, which would equal four times the largest IPO in history.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The attack cut oil production in half ahead of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco's plans for what could be the largest initial public offering.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9362/5957a727b046408dbeca80a26624dfb6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
