And that is just 30 per cent of the industry \u2013 it could be much more.'\n\nElsewhere, a grower from the South-West has had to let broccoli valued at \u00a3100,000 rot in his fields. Another from Ledbury, Herefordshire, who needs an extra 100 pickers, has lost the equivalent of 87,000 punnets of raspberries.\n\nJack Ward, chief executive of the British Growers Association, said: 'I know a mushroom grower in East Anglia who is operating at two-thirds capacity because he can't get workers.'\n\nThe shortage of pickers and packers is also hitting vegetable growers ahead of the Christmas period, with industry leaders fearing supplies of Brussels sprouts (pictured) could be affected\n\nIn recent years, a shortage of workers from Eastern Europe has caused problems for growers but the situation has worsened this year over Brexit fears.\n\nIn August, the labour shortage was reported to be almost 18 per cent. Last month, it was 20 per cent, but experts fear this month the figure could be as high as 30 per cent.\n\nA similar 20 per cent shortage of workers last year was eased when growers increased recruitment by offering higher wages \u2013 the average is \u00a312 per hour \u2013 and better bonuses.\n\nBut this year, workers are apparently put off by the devaluation of sterling. Instead, they are taking jobs paid in euros in the Netherlands, Germany and Spain.\n\nMrs Capper said: 'EU workers now fear they need to buy a passport when they have always been able to travel and work here on identity cards.'\n\nIndustry experts estimate that an extra 10,000 workers are needed. The NFU wants the Government to expand a pilot scheme allowing workers from outside the EU to travel for seasonal work in Britain. At present, only 2,500 such work permits a year are granted.\n\nStephanie Maurel, of labour provider Concordia, said: 'We've advertised in Jobcentre Plus but have less than five British workers on our books. There is no appetite for hard, outdoor seasonal work.'\n\nA government spokesman said: 'When we leave the EU, we'll have an immigration system which will benefit the whole of the UK, including growers.'", "description": "A third of growers say they have been forced to leave 100 tons of fruit unpicked - around 16 million apples - because of a labour shortfall in part fuelled by Brexit uncertainty.", "authors": ["Valerie Elliott For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/20/19935308-0-image-a-5_1571513959088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
