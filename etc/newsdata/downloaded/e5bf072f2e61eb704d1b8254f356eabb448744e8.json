The lawmaker added that his 5-year-old daughter already has begun to feel the pressure of conforming to white beauty standards.\n\n\u201cShe came home from pre-K one day and said, \u2018Why is my hair not straight like my classmates? I think it would be better [if it was],\u2019\u201d Mr. Jawando said. \u201cIt was a really sad moment that underscored the point that these standards of beauty are ingrained so early and we have to do all we can to work against that and let everyone know that they\u2019re great as who they are.\u201d\n\nCouncil President Nancy Navarro, District 4 Democrat, is the co-lead sponsor of the legislation with Mr. Jawando. She said the CROWN Act sends a message that \u201cwhatever is growing out of your head is beautiful and accepted and you can be proud of your heritage and your ethnicity and who you are.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Council members Gabe Albornoz (at-large), Tom Hucker (District 5), Hans Riemer (at-large) and Evan Glass (at-large) co-sponsored the legislation.\n\nA public hearing on the measure is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Oct. 15.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s legislative meeting, the council also celebrated Hispanic Heritage Month by honoring prominent Hispanic members of the community such as singer Jonathan Acosta; Claudia Campos Galvan, program director at Nueva Vida, a nonprofit that provides services for cancer patients; former Maryland state Del. Ana Sol Gutierrez; and Telemundo sports anchor Moises Linares.\n\n\u201cBeing able to honor this diverse mosaic of cultures in this nation is what makes our country, the United States, such a strong beacon of democracy,\u201d said Mrs. Navarro, who is the first Latina elected to council. \u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize the contributions, by not only our Latino/a leaders, but also those individuals who work hard each day to improve the lives of those around them. These are the true heroes.\u201d\n\nMore than 200,000 Hispanics live in the county, accounting for about 54% of its population.\n\nMeanwhile, County Executive Marc Elrich formally announced Tuesday his nomination of acting police Chief Marcus Jones to become the department\u2019s permanent leader.\n\nA 34-year veteran of the force, Chief Jones has served as acting chief since June. Thomas Manger retired as chief in April.\n\nIf approved by the council, Chief Jones will be the department\u2019s 17th top leader and the third black officer to hold the position.\n\nMr. Hucker also introduced legislation that would raise the legal age to distribute or possess tobacco or e-cigarette products from 18 to 21 years old, to match the state law on the issue.\n\nThis legislation comes after lawmakers introduced legislation last week that would prohibit the sale of vaping and e-cigarette products within a half-mile of a middle or high school.\n\nThe council will host a public hearing on the bill at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 5.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
