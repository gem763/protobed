Jury selection in the drug trafficking trial of Tony Hernandez began Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in U.S. federal court in Manhattan. U.S. prosecutors allege the 41-year-old used his government connections to smuggle U.S.-bound cocaine through Honduras. (AP Photo/Fernando Antonio, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Prosecutors alleged Wednesday that convicted Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n personally gave $1 million in bribes to the brother of Honduras\u2019 president to pass on to the Central American leader, who swiftly denied wrongdoing.\n\nProsecutor Jason Richman revealed the allegation in a federal court in Manhattan where Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, 41, is accused of using his government connections to smuggle U.S.-bound cocaine through Honduras.\n\nIn opening statements, Richman described Hern\u00e1ndez as \u201cuntouchable\u201d in Honduras and confident he would never face justice because of his powerful sibling.\n\n\u201cThe defendant was protected by and had access to his brother, the current sitting president of Honduras, a man who himself has received millions of dollars in drug money bribes _ bribes he received from some of the largest cocaine traffickers in the world, bribes he received from men like \u2018El Chapo\u2019 and the Sinaloa cartel who personally delivered $1 million to the defendant for his brother,\u201d Richman said.\n\nThe defendant was described as a \u201cviolent drug trafficker of epic proportions\u201d who moved \u201cmassive\u201d amounts of narcotics.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez\u2019s defense told jurors they will see no proof against their client during the trial.\n\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez has been labeled a co-conspirator, though he has not been charged. Prosecutors allege he took some $1.5 million in drug proceeds to win his first presidential campaign in 2013, in exchange for traffickers receiving protection.\n\n\u201cThe allegation in itself is 100% false, absurd and ridiculous ... this is less serious than Alice in Wonderland,\u201d the president tweeted Wednesday after news of the prosecutor\u2019s affirmations circulated. He has said in the past that drug smugglers extradited under his government are seeking revenge.\n\nRelatives of Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, who was arrested in 2018 in Miami, declined to speak with journalists at the court. In Honduras, Juan Arnaldo Hern\u00e1ndez, another brother, predicted Tony Hern\u00e1ndez will be cleared of the accusations.\n\nJury selection in the case took place earlier in the day.\n\nRichman told the panel that they would hear details of two murders in which Tony Hern\u00e1ndez was allegedly involved. He said the defendant stamped cocaine shipments with his initials, T.H., and first got into smuggling around 2004.\n\nProsecutors will call as witnesses Drug Enforcement Administration agents, an expert on Honduran politics and history, and former drug traffickers who worked with Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\n\u201cAt the end the question won\u2019t be whether you like the witnesses,\u201d Richman said, \u201cbut whether you believe them.\u201d\n\nJuan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez was re-elected in 2017 despite a constitutional ban on re-election. Last week, Honduras signed an agreement about handling asylum seekers with the U.S. government.\n\nIn early August, prosecutors in New York accused him of working with his brother and then-President Porfirio Lobo, who was in office in 2010-2014, to take advantage of drug trafficking to consolidate power and control in Honduras.\n\nIn a 49-page document, prosecutors said the president and his predecessor depended on drug money for campaign financing. The document alleged that the Honduran government essentially functions as a narco-state.\n\nThe president has called the accusations false and retaliation for his government\u2019s policies on fighting organized crime and drug trafficking, highlighting among other measures laws on extradition, money laundering and cleaning up police forces.\n\nThe prosecutor did not say when the purported bribery by Guzm\u00e1n took place, and it was not clear whether it was part of or separate from the $1.5 million that Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez allegedly received from traffickers.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n, the longtime boss of the Sinaloa cartel, gained international notoriety for twice escaping prison in Mexico.\n\nAfter being extradited from Mexico, Guzm\u00e1n was convicted in a U.S. court earlier this year, sentenced to life behind bars and sent to a super-secure lockup in Colorado.", "description": "Prosecutors alleged Wednesday that convicted Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n personally gave $1 million in bribes to the brother of Honduras\u2019 president to pass on to the Central American leader, who swiftly denied wrongdoing.
