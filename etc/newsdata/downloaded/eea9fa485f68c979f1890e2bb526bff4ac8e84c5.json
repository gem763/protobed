Here are some of his most memorable run-ins.\n\n1) Ahead of the 2015 general election, Bercow headed off an attempt to oust him by the Conservative party leadership. A motion for there to be a secret ballot to reselect a speaker when parliament returned, tabled by the then leader of the house, William Hague, was defeated by 228 to 202 amid emotional scenes. Labour MPs applauded him, while Bercow wiped away a tear.\n\n2) The Speaker was accused of breaking rules on political impartiality when he said Donald Trump was unfit to address MPs in Westminster because parliament was opposed to \u201cracism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary\u201d. He said that while he did not have the power to block a state visit, the opportunity to speak in the prestigious Westminster Hall was \u201cnot an automatic right, it is an earned honour\u201d.\n\nQ&A What is the role of the Speaker and how are they elected? Show Hide The Speaker is the chief officer and the highest authority in the House of Commons. They chair parliamentary debate to call MPs to speak, to keep order, and to instruct when votes should be taken. The Speaker is expected to remain politically neutral on all issues, and to continue this even in retirement. On appointment as Speaker, they resign from their political party. They continue to stand for election as an MP, but by tradition they are unopposed in their constituency by the major parties. The Speaker has the power to compel MPs to withdraw remarks, to suspend individual MPs, or to suspend the whole sitting of the House of Commons in case of serious disruption. The current Speaker is John Bercow, who was elected to the role by MPs on 22 June 2009. He has announced he intends to step down on 31 October. Speakers are elected by MPs in a secret ballot. MPs are given a list of candidates and make their choice. If a candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, the question is put to the house that he or she takes the chair as Speaker. If no candidate reaches 50%, the candidate with the fewest votes and those with less than 5% of the vote are eliminated, and MPs vote again until one candidate succeeds.

Leadsom was at the forefront of moves to set up channels for dealing with complaints by Commons staff against their MP employers. It wasn\u2019t the last time the pair were to clash. In March, Bercow reprimanded Leadsom for using her mobile phone during Commons business, while Leadsom later accused the Speaker of failing to show MPs \u201ccourtesy and respect\u201d.\n\n4) After he allowed an amendment by the Tory rebel Dominic Grieve to be voted on in January, he was labelled \u201cSpeaker of the Devil\u201d by one newspaper, while the Daily Mail called him an \u201cegotistical preening popinjay [who] has shamelessly put his anti-Brexit bias before the national interest \u2013 and is a disgrace to his office\u201d. The amendment compelled the government to say within three sitting days what it would do if Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal was voted down as expected.\n\n5) In March this year, Bercow threw the government into a state of shock when he blocked an planned attempt by May to bring a third vote on her withdrawal bill to parliament. He cited a convention dating back to 1604 which says a vote on a motion that is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as a rejected motion should not be permitted. \u201cThe speaker did not forewarn us of the content of his statement or the fact that he was making one,\u201d May\u2019s spokeswoman told journalists that afternoon.", "description": "In a decade in the spotlight, the Speaker has both infuriated and delighted MPs", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3f3aa1830738b98a5f154171eab67fe72ee555/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6b96bab92e23a9394edcd5aaadac1b0", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
