McKinley\u2019s testimony comes as the State Department is mired in the controversy over efforts by Trump and his associates to pressure Ukrainian leaders to investigate the president\u2019s political rivals.\n\nAccording to a White House readout of Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asked his counterpart to link up with Giuliani and investigate Biden. The request, which came amid a holdup of congressionally authorized military aid to Ukraine, is now at the center of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Hill concluded her government work just days before Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky.\n\nHill worked on the National Security Council overseeing U.S. policy toward Russia and is a longtime critic of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, in stark contrast to a president who has openly challenged the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump. A fluent Russian speaker, Hill helped engineer the administration\u2019s harsh response to a Russian chemical attack in the U.K., among other internal efforts to promote a more skeptical approach to Moscow.\n\nFiona Hill worked on the National Security Council overseeing U.S. policy toward Russia and is a longtime critic of Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nHill\u2019s appearance kicks off another busy week for House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, is set to testify on Thursday, and the week is riddled with deadlines for document requests and subpoenas to government agencies and officials, an indication of Democrats\u2019 breakneck pace as they build a case against Trump.\n\nAhead of Hill\u2019s testimony, Republican lawmakers echoed their long-standing criticisms of the impeachment process that Democrats have established, accusing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of running a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d that lacks transparency.\n\nThe State Department initially blocked Sondland from appearing before the House\u2019s impeachment investigators last week, but after receiving a subpoena, Sondland\u2019s attorney says his client will appear before the three committees spearheading the probe on Thursday.\n\nText messages provided to the committees by Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, showed that Sondland was deeply involved in talks surrounding Trump\u2019s desire for Ukrainian officials to probe Biden and to assist the Justice Department in its investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation \u2014 a top target of Trump and his allies.\n\nUnlike Hill, Sondland is a political appointee who donated to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and his inaugural committee. The Washington Post reported that Sondland was expected to tell Congress that Trump himself dictated one of the text messages to his fellow diplomats in which he stated that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d with Ukraine involving military aid.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/53/e7/5b059127438089c0b21f1378944f/20191014-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
