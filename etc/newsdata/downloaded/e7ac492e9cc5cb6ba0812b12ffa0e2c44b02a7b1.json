Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee that oversees Pentagon spending.\n\nThere may be other hurdles.\n\nA federal court in Texas ruled last week that Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamation was unlawful. That judge is still deciding what action to take and has asked both sides to file briefs on what powers a court has to restrain the president, the head of a co-equal branch of government.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s building plans have not made much progress in expanding existing fencing.\n\nSince Mr. Trump took office, Customs and Border Protection has erected 71 miles of wall \u2014 but all of that is replacement of old fencing. Officials say no new miles of the border have been sealed off beyond the 652 miles he inherited from President Obama.\n\nThe wall is also coming in over budget, congressional Democrats said this week.\n\nThey said the $6.1 billion Mr. Trump siphoned away from the Pentagon with his emergency declaration didn\u2019t take into account overhead and bureaucracy costs, and the administration notified them last week that it\u2019s going to grab another $129 million in money that was supposed to go to fight drug production in Afghanistan.\n\nThat\u2019s in addition to the $6.1 billion that was coming out of military projects across the globe.\n\nDemocratic campaign operatives swung into action Thursday to chastise Republicans whose districts stand to see money drained from their local military bases.\n\nThe White House says Congress could easily restore the money for those projects in the 2020 budget.\n\nBut Democrats say to do so would mean giving Mr. Trump\u2019s wall money grab an imprimatur. Most Democrats voted last month against a non-binding measure that would have urged replenishment of the funds.\n\nDemocrats chide Mr. Trump for having to turn to U.S. taxpayers for funding, saying he promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would bear the financial burden.\n\nMr. Trump says Mexico is doing just that, indirectly, through terms of trade.\n\nThe White House requested another $5 billion in border wall money in its fiscal 2020 budget. The House, controlled by Democrats, has erased those funds from its Homeland Security spending bill. The Senate has included the money in its version, but that bill has yet to clear the chamber.\n\nMinutes before the veto override failed, Senate Democrats also lost their bid to overturn Mr. Trump and reinstate Obama-era global warming restrictions known as the Clean Power Plan.\n\nThe Obama regulations were designed to limit fossil fuel-intensive energy production, particularly coal-based production. The Trump administration released a policy undoing the Obama rules, and Democrats sought to attempt a congressional veto.\n\n\u201cTime is running out for the United States to meet the existential threat posed by climate change,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t keep all his Democrats in line, much less win over Republicans, and saw his effort doomed on a 51-43 vote.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, cheered the outcome, saying it saved the country as many as 125,000 jobs and prevented double-digit increases in energy costs.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
