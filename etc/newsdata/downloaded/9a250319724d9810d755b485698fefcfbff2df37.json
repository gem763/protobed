There\u2019s less and less public buildings available for people to use, but one of the key challenges that we have in December is that the polling stations already have bookings.\u201d\n\nEven more of a potential difficulty is the prospect of two different electoral registers being in use.\n\nThe electoral roll is updated annually on 1 December, meaning the new register would be in place in time to be used for a possible election.\n\nHowever, polling cards for an early December election would need to be sent out in November, meaning one electoral register would be used for sending the cards and another used for the actual election.\n\nSome in Tory party are also now worried that a winter flu crisis could thwart their \u201cwe love the NHS, actually\u201d message if they do go to the polls before Christmas.\n\nAnd as The Times points out today, there are some bad omens for the party. The last time a Tory PM went to the country in December, Stanley Baldwin lost his majority before having to quit the following month.\n\n\u201cEveryone who tries in politics to do the thing he believes in \u2026 is sure to come a smeller,\u201d he said at the tail end of 1923.\n\nA smeller! Surely a term ripe for being brought back into use.\n\nAnyway, our correspondent Benjamin Kentish has had a look at some of more serious concerns about the electoral roll.", "description": "EU ambassadors failed to reach agreement on a further Brexit extension at a meeting on Friday morning, postponing their decision in a move that could have a bearing on whether Boris Johnson gets his pre-Christmas general election.", "authors": ["Adam Forrest", "Ashley Cowburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/24/18/wave1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
