The attack was claimed by the Houthi rebels of neighboring Yemen, and is part of an ongoing conflict on the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIn immediate, practical terms, industry analysts expect crude to gain as much as $10 per barrel when trading resumes after the weekend. From Seaport Global, head of energy trading Roberto Friendlander says that the exact spike in oil prices will depend on how long Saudi production is disrupted: \u201cIf it is a few days, the Saudis are working to restore production and will provide more information in the next 48 hours, the impact is more likely to be $3-5\u2026\u201d\n\nOf course, every market disruption marks an opportunity for someone. If Saudi oil is off the markets, the supply has to be compensated somewhere, and this where the last few years\u2019 surge in American output is important. Increased production from US oil and gas fields have made the country the world\u2019s top oil producers, and at current trends the US will become a net exporter of oil and gas in 2020.\n\nWith this in the background, it\u2019s time again to look at the Texas oil companies. The Permian Basin oil fields of West Texas are richest petroleum producing areas in the United States. We\u2019ve dipped into TipRanks\u2019 database, to find out what Wall Street\u2019s analysts are saying about the energy companies working in the Texas oil fields.\n\nConcho Resources, Inc.\n\nConcho (CXO \u2013 Get Report) is one of many energy companies that focuses on the Permian Basin. The company\u2019s specific operating areas are in the Delaware Basin, the Permian\u2019s second largest subdivision, and CXO controls over 1.1 billion barrels of proven hydrocarbon reserves.\n\nThe stock offers buyers a discount at the moment, as it\u2019s down 24% in the markets following an EPS miss in July\u2019s Q2 earnings report. Despite the miss, both hedge funds and market insiders are picking up this stock. Hedge funds increased holdings in CXO by 1.7 million shares in Q2, while last month, after the earnings report, industry insiders bought over $1.5 million worth of shares in Concho.\n\nWall Street analysts are also bullish on CXO. From MKM Partners, John Gerdes gives it a $116 price target, indicating confidence in an impressive 57% upside. Jefferies analyst Mark Lear is even more optimistic about Concho. His $127 target implies an upside of 72%.\n\nOverall, CXO has a $118 average price target from the analysts, suggesting an upside of 61% from the share price of $73. The Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 12 buys, 2 holds, and 1 sell set in the last three months.\n\nDiamondback Energy, Inc.\n\nDiamondback (FANG \u2013 Get Report) offers investors a firm base of 992 million barrels of proven oil and gas reserves in the Permian Basin. Petroleum makes up 63% of the company\u2019s recoverable assets, while natural gas and natural gas liquids make up the remaining 37%.\n\nDiamondback reported a mixed result in the second quarter. EPS and revenues, at $1.70 and $1.02 billion, were both up year-over-year, but missed the forecasts. Net profit was a robust $349 million, and the company continues to pay out its quarterly dividend of 18.75 cents per share. Looking at long-term trends, FANG shares are up 29% in the last five years.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The world just lost 5% of its daily oil output, as Saudi Arabi cut production by half in the wake of a drone attack on Saudi Aramco oil fields.
