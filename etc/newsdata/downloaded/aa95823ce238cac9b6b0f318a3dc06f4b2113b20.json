We try to get more books on arts, literature, politics and history. That's why we decide to join the project,\" Puglisi said.\n\nPi Jun, president of China Youth Publishing Group, said the \"Chinese Bookshelf\" is an important measure to meet Western readers's increasing need to learn about China through high-quality books.\n\nLiu Xiaoming, Chinese ambassador to Britain, said in a congratulatory letter to the launching ceremony that the carefully-selected books in the \"Chinese Bookshelf\" will serve as a bridge for cultural exchanges and a window for Western readers to understand China.\n\nRichard Charkin, a world-renowned publisher and former president of the International Publishers Association, said at the launching ceremony that as an old friend who has been working closely with many Chinese publishers, he is happy to see further globalization of Chinese publishing through projects like \"Chinese Bookshelf.\"\n\n\"Chinese publishing has transformed itself in the last 10 to 20 years, and it is now among the leading publishing nations of the world ... I think the more the Chinese and Western publishers can develop global Chinese books, journals, databases, the more understanding there will be between the East and West,\" he said.", "description": "\"Chinese Bookshelf,\" a project which aims to provide local readers an access to Chinese books and culture, was launched Tuesday here.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/23/5dafb5e2a310cf3e97a28ab6.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
