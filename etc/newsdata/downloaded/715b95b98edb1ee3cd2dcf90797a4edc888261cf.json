Photo: Amazon Studios\n\nRaphael Bob-Waksberg and Kate Purdy, two of the minds behind Netflix\u2019s brilliant BoJack Horseman, are the creators of Undone, but you may not realize that at first sight. Even though Undone is, like BoJack, an animated series in which a protagonist confronts buried psychological issues, its style is very, very different.\n\nCreated using rotoscope animation, a process in which live-action footage is traced to yield animated imagery, Undone resembles Richard Linklater\u2019s films Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly more than the Netflix series about a washed-up equine sitcom star. (In fact, the same team that did the rotoscope work on A Scanner Darkly also worked on Undone.) But that very specific choice of medium is a perfect fit for this Amazon drama, which slides regularly between the present, the past, and interactions that may or may not be hallucinations.\n\nThe first episode introduces Alma (Rosa Salazar), a day care employee in a committed but humdrum relationship with her boyfriend Sam (Siddharth Dhananjay) whose younger sister Becca (Angelique Cabral) is newly engaged. After breaking up abruptly with Sam and getting into an argument with Becca, Alma gets into a major car accident that temporarily puts her in a coma. When she awakens in episode two, she starts seeing things around her differently.\n\nHer hospital room suddenly dissolves into a pivotal Halloween night from her childhood. Also, her late father, played by Bob Odenkirk, is right there in the room, talking to her even though he died in a car accident years earlier. As the episodes progress \u2014 Amazon provided five for review out of eight total \u2014 Alma begins to cross from one realm to the next with even more fluidity, though sometimes she can\u2019t always control those crossings to the extent she desires. (At one point, she ends up completely naked in front of a classroom full of her students.) But her dad, Jacob, acts as her guide, showing her how to bend time and space to her will for a specific reason: he wants her to travel backwards several years to find out how he actually died. As he tells her, it may not have been a car crash on that Halloween night that did him in after all.\n\nThe idea for Undone came to Purdy, according to a New York Times interview, when she was working on the trippy BoJack Horseman episode \u201cDowner Ending,\u201d back in season one. The vibe of Undone is similar to the more experimental, non-linear installments of BoJack \u2014 the Alzheimer\u2019s-focused \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow\u201d also comes to mind. As Alma engages with her father, argues with her still-alive mother, and begins to recall more and more repressed moments from when she was a girl, more questions arise as to what is really going on with her. Did the car accident dislodge data from somewhere inside her brain, or did it cause genuine damage? Is she suffering from a mental illness that explains the scattershot nature of her thought process? Is it possible she never woke up from the coma? Without seeing the entire season, it\u2019s hard to know whether these questions will be resolved or whether this stream-of-consciousness storytelling will pay off. But I do know that Undone gets more fascinating with each episode and avoids becoming too unwieldy by keeping those episodes tight, with runtimes clocking in at a just-right 23 minutes.\n\nThis type of animation is not normally done for television and you can see why. Every frame announces that hours and hours of work went into crafting its details, from the sarcastic twinkles in Alma\u2019s eyes to the soft glow of lights along San Antonio\u2019s river walk. But director Hisko Hulsing, who handled the animated sequences in Cobain: Montage of Heck, is also mindful of sound. As a child, Alma was deaf and only began to hear fully once she got a cochlear implant. Her pre-implant memories often sound like they\u2019re coming from far, far underwater, adding to the sense that, in all aspects of her life, Alma is grasping for something that\u2019s just out of reach.\n\nSalazar, who starred in Alita: Battle Angel and played Zoe on NBC\u2019s Parenthood, has an earthy, grounded quality that makes it natural to trust her and believe everything she\u2019s experiencing is real. Whether it is or not remains to be seen. But Undone\u2019s unusual sense of flow makes you want to go with it, even when \u2014 maybe especially because \u2014 it\u2019s never clear where or when it\u2019s going to jump next.", "description": "A review of Amazon\u2019s Undone, a new animated series from Raphael Bob-Waksberg and Kate Purdy of BoJack Horseman fame.", "authors": ["Jen Chaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-undone.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
