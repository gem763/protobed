He has called for a unity government and power-sharing agreement.\n\nGantz's endorsements put him at 54 seats, and he has previously refused to join a government with Netanyahu, who is embroiled in several corruption scandals and may face criminal charges in the near future.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIsrael went to the polls on September 17 in elections meant to decide the future of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pitting a major ally of US President Donald Trump against a former top Israeli military chief.\n\nIf this feels familiar, it is.\n\nIsrael most recently had an election just five months ago, after Netanyahu's government dissolved over clashes with his coalition partners. Early elections were called for April 9.\n\nNetanyahu was \u2014 and is again \u2014 facing Benny Gantz, a 60-year-old who served as the head of the Israel Defense Forces from 2011 to 2015, navigating the country through two incursions on the Gaza Strip.\n\nGantz leads the centrist Blue and White party, which was formed only this year.\n\nMany voters have voiced support for Gantz, who would undeniably bring change after Netanyahu's four terms and 13 years as prime minister. Netanyahu heads the right-wing Likud party.\n\nHe is the longest-serving leader in Israel's history.\n\nBack in April, both Netanyahu and Gantz won 35 seats in Israel's parliament, far short of the 61 needed for an outright majority. (Israel's parliament, called the Knesset, has 120 seats.)\n\nIf a party has no majority, the Israeli president \u2014 currently Reuven Rivlin \u2014 picks a prime minister based on who is considered most able to form a coalition. In April, Rivlin chose Netanyahu, who then failed to form a coalition government. The consequence was the September election.\n\nrivlin israeli elections More\n\nMenachen Kahana/Pool via REUTERS\n\nElection results put Gantz ahead of Netanyahu \u2014 but it doesn't mean he will win\n\nThough Israelis are reliving an experience they went through just months ago, voter turnout this election was higher than April's, up to 69.4% from 67.9%.\n\nAs of 3 a.m. local time Tuesday in Israel, Gantz's Blue and White party was slightly ahead with 25.93% of the vote.\n\nNetanyahu's Likud party trailed with 25.09% of the vote, with 69% of the votes tallied.\n\nThough results are still being finalized, exit polls indicate that the Blue and White party has won 33 seats in the Knesset, overtaking the Likud party which won 31 seats.\n\nThird parties, soon to become strategic allies to the as-of-yet undetermined winner, held smaller yet significant portions of the vote.\n\nMost notably, the Arab Palestinian Joint List came in as the third-largest party, winning 10.62% of the vote, equal to 13 seats.\n\nBecause no party has secured an outright majority, Rivlin will select his choice based on discussions with smaller parties. After the president decides, the chosen candidate has 42 days to form a coalition government.\n\nIf the selected leader can't form a coalition, another candidate will be given a chance.\n\nAs of Monday evening local time, Netanyahu's endorsements put him at 55 seats, narrowly inching ahead of Gantz, whose recommendations place him at 54 seats.\n\nGantz was recommended Arab party lawmakers on Sunday, a shock move given that Arab-led parties have not put forward a recommendation for who should lead the government since 1992.", "description": "Though Gantz has won slightly more seats in Israel\u2019s parliament than Netanyahu, he may not have the support of smaller parties needed to secure a win.", "authors": ["Rosie Perper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KDqktIoVG6AzN3Np9._LFw--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/60dc7e1ef7a74cf4d364188e0b8a936a", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
