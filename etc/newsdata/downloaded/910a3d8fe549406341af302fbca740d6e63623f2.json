REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nU.S. Treasury yields rose as $78 billion in note and bond supply slated for auction this week helped push prices lower after last week\u2019s dramatic rise.\n\nAs deputy level U.S.-China trade talks kicked off on Monday, the White House confirmed that high-level talks involving Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would start on Thursday.\n\nLate in the session, Wall Street\u2019s major indexes briefly turned higher after positive tweets about the trade talks. But they then sank again as hopes for progress faded.\n\nWithout a clear bet to make on the trade talks outcome, investors appeared to see the dollar as the safest place, according to Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cYou can expect this (volatility) all week leading up to the discussions with China on trade. Markets are trying to front run the outcome,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cBonds and stocks will be volatile this week.

Hopes of U.S.-China trade progress had helped lift oil prices earlier in the session.

A move above 5.8577 would send the currency to its weakest since June.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump later threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey\u201d if Ankara does anything \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.17%, with the euro EUR= down 0.05% to $1.097.\n\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.31% versus the greenback at 107.30 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2294, down 0.30% on the day.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields drifted higher, with benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last down 14/32 in price to yield 1.5614%, from 1.514% late on Friday.\n\nSpot gold XAU= dropped 0.8% to $1,492.26 an ounce.
