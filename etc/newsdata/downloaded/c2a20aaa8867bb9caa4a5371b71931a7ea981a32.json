Investors are hoping that the two countries reach a compromise and that Beijing's emissaries are ready to offer compromises to prevent Mr. Trump from raising tariff levels next week and imposing new ones in December.\n\nPresident Trump said Friday morning on Twitter that \"good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days.\" Later in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the White House that he and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer have had \"productive\" discussions with China.\n\nTrade tensions have been a key driver of market volatility this year as investors have reacted to fresh tariffs between the two countries and tweets from President Trump on their progress. In a sign of how eager investors have been for a resolution on trade, anticipation of a deal was enough to lure some investors back into stocks after declines earlier this week and push them out of traditionally safer bets like gold, the Japanese yen and Treasurys.\n\n\"This has been an irritant, I would say, for investors,\" said John Carey, a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management. A deal \"would ease at least one source of worry.\"\n\nFriday's stock rally was broad-based, with all 11 of the S&P 500's sectors climbing alongside global benchmarks. Investors cheering the prospect of a trade deal late in the week helped put the stock index back within 2% of a record high hit in July.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 483 points, or 1.8%. The S&P 500 surged 1.7%. Both indexes were on track to avert a fourth straight week of losses. The Nasdaq Composite added 2%.\n\nShares of industrials companies were some of the largest gainers in the S&P 500, outpacing the broader index's gains. Caterpillar, which has been a bellwether stock for trade, added 5.9%. Apple shares rose 2.7%, on track for a fresh record.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng rose 2.3% and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.9%.\n\n\"Actions speak louder than words,\" said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets U.K. \"At the end of the day, if the two sides were not interested in having some progress, they wouldn't even be meeting today.\"\n\nThe prospect of a trade deal also helped calm fears of a recession that had simmered in recent months. Adding to the enthusiasm, U.S. consumer sentiment rose in early October, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. Investors have been closely watching for signs that lackluster manufacturing data around the world will spill over to the consumer, which has been a source of strength in the U.S. economy.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.748% Friday, from 1.649% Thursday, its biggest single-day jump since September. Yields rise as bond prices fall. The Federal Reserve said on Friday that it will start buying Treasury bills to boost its balance sheet to avoid the unexpected strains in money markets experienced last month.\n\nGlobal stocks and bond yields rose as tensions in Europe calmed, too. The British pound jumped against the dollar, while shares of U.K. banks and homebuilders advanced as investors grew more optimistic about the U.K.'s divorce deal with the European Union.\n\nThe pound's gains followed its largest one-day jump since March on Thursday as Brexit talks progressed between the U.K. and Ireland. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, unexpectedly said they saw a chance of a Brexit deal. On Friday, European Council President Donald Tusk said he saw \"promising signals\" from the talks.\n\n\"Those were sort of the two biggest economic uncertainties facing the market,\" said Jerry Lucas, senior trading strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management, of U.S. and China trade and Brexit. \"There's cause for optimism right now.\"\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.K. gilt continued to climb, rising to 0.686% from 0.462% Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the yen fell to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since August in trading Friday, while gold prices dropped 0.8%.\n\nStill, some investors said it was too soon to wager on a cease-fire between the U.S. and China, given how turbulent negotiations have been.\n\n\"There's been such a back and forth on trade,\" said John Porter, chief investment officer at Mellon Investments Corp. \"When I see a conclusive agreement in place, then I'll react to the details.\"\n\nCrude oil prices also gained after an Iranian tanker near the Saudi Arabian coast suffered damage Friday in what the ship's owner suggested may have been a missile attack.\n\nWill Horner contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 11, 2019 15:54 ET (19:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
