The center was founded by twenty black Republicans and twenty black Democrats in 2015 to promote the cause of criminal justice reform in a bipartisan fashion.\n\n\u201cThey said it couldn\u2019t be done. Past administrations had tried and failed; some didn\u2019t try very hard, I will say that,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president noted the bill that passed in 2018 was truly bipartisan as people of all backgrounds joined together to push for the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe had them so liberal you wouldn\u2019t believe it and so conservative you wouldn\u2019t believe it, and they got together,\u201d Trump said, calling it \u201ca beautiful thing to watch.\u201d\n\nHe cited the bill as an example of what could take place in America with both parties united.\n\n\u201cThe First Step Act proved that we can achieve amazing breakthroughs when we come together as a nation and we put the interests of our citizens before the interests of any political party,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president praised the long history of black Americans striving for freedom, civil rights, and equality, noting that they represented the \u201cforgotten man\u201d he campaigned for in 2016.\n\n\u201cMy goal has been to give a voice to the voiceless and to make Washington see and hear those who are made to feel silent and to feel invisible,\u201d he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that criminal justice reform was not part of his 2016 campaign but said he heard from many advocates for the issue who asked him to fight for the forgotten people in America\u2019s prison systems.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I\u2019m not sure that what I did was a popular thing or an unpopular thing, but I knew it was the right thing to do,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe recalled that Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West brought attention to the case of Alice Johnson who had served 22 years of a first-time drug offense and was facing up to 28 more years in prison.\n\n\u201cThe more people I spoke with, the more clear it became the system could be deeply unfair, contributing to a tragic cycle of poverty and crime and incarceration,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTanesha Bannister, a woman released as a consequence of the First Step Act, also spoke at the event, thanking the president for his efforts. In 2004, Bannister was sentenced to life in prison after she was convicted in a cocaine smuggling trial.\n\n\u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been committed to advancing fairness and opportunity to the African American community,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many people with empty political rhetoric. We\u2019re doing the opposite: we\u2019re acting, not talking.\u201d\n\nThe president also celebrated the strength of the American economy under his administration and the historic unemployment rates for black Americans.\n\n\u201cPerhaps our economy is the best criminal justice reform of all because when people can get a job earn a paycheck and find purpose in their work, and especially when they are coming out of prison, it\u2019s really an incredible thing,\u201d he said as the audience applauded.\n\nTrump promised to keep fighting for the issue and said he will continue fighting for the black community as long as he is president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made our nation stronger than ever before, and I\u2019m here to tell you we\u2019re just getting started, and we\u2019re just getting started for the African American community too,\u201d he said.\n\nThe crowd shouted and cheered \u201cfour more years\u201d as the president grinned and pumped his fist.", "description": "Trump spoke Friday about his effort to pass criminal justice reform, noting that it canceled former President Clinton's 1994 crime bill.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/donald-trump-oct2019-second-step-presidential-justice-forum-ap-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
