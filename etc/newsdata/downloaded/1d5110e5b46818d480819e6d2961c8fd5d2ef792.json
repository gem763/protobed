In 2017, 13% of teens reported having experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, Pew Research Center reported. In 2007, when more millennials were teens, that number was just 8%.\n\nSocial media might be fueling the increase in mental illness, as Gen Z is the first truly digital generation. Pew Research Center found 45% of teens aged 13 to 17 said they use the internet \u201calmost constantly.\u201d Over-use of social media can cause loneliness, depression, and anxiety, the Anxiety and Depression Association of America reported.\n\nGen Z teenagers told Business Insider the constant social-media use was driving a longing for interpersonal connection.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have too much of a reliance on technology,\u201d Jess Gallo, 19, said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t really appreciate the value of books or interpersonal communication.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with depression or has had thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life, there\u2019s help for you.
