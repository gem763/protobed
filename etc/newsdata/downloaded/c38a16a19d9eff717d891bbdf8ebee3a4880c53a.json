All of the men in the unit are on a mission of vengeance, as its sine qua non is you must have lost a family member to ISIS in order to join. You can practically feel the bullets whizzing by as Carnahan drops you right into war-torn Iraq where Kawa (Adam Bessa), a 21-year-old police officer, is left with no other choice than to join Col. Jasem (Suhail Dabbach) and his SWAT team after barely eking his way out of a deadly firefight.\n\n\u201cFor us, we can say this is the first film to represent Arabs in a positive way, Iraqis in a positive way and Muslims in a positive way. In war movies, there\u2019s the American Sniper problem: You never see what\u2019s on the opposite side,\u201d says producer Mohamed Al-Daradji, himself kidnapped by Iraqi insurgents in the early aughts, who handled the logistics of the Marrakech film shoot. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a chance to represent ourselves at this level.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Al-Daradji, Mosul is produced by the two biggest filmmakers in the world right now: Anthony and Joe Russo, aka the Russo Brothers\u2014the director duo behind the Marvel superhero blockbusters Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, the last of which recently eclipsed Avatar to become the highest-grossing movie of all time. It\u2019s the first film to be released by their independent film studio AGBO, and is eyeing a domestic distributor for an Oscar-qualifying run in December.\n\nThe Daily Beast sat down with the Russo Brothers at the Venice Film Festival to discuss their new film and why we need more diversity on screen\u2014especially in the age of Trump.\n\nSo, Mosul is the very first movie out of the gate for your film studio AGBO.\n\nJoe Russo: Yes, the first movie out of the gate is this film. Hopefully it defines the direction we want to move as a company, which is telling compelling stories no matter where they come from, because narrative is a great unifier. We saw with Marvel films the way stories can bring people together around the world and they can also tell a different perspective. We\u2019ve had a hundred years of western-Hollywood-white-movie dominance. It\u2019s going to be interesting, now that people seem to be available and ready, to hear all kinds of other stories.\n\nOne of the commendable things about this film\u2014and there are several\u2014is that it does give us Arab heroes, something this is in painfully short supply in Hollywood.\n\nJoe Russo: It\u2019s critical, because you reinforce either negative or positive ideas about representation if you tell the same kinds of stories over and over again. If these actors can only ever walk in a room to audition for a terrorist, then that is without question going to reinforce the way people perceive their culture.\n\nAs a kid growing up in the \u201890s, pretty much the only time we saw Arab characters in Hollywood films were playing terrorists. I grew up with Executive Decision and True Lies, and the Arab terrorists in True Lies are members of \u201cCrimson Jihad,\u201d just this comically absurd terrorist organization.\n\nJoe Russo: Villainous cartoon characters.\n\nAnthony Russo: And look, there\u2019s an enormous creative upside here, too. As a storyteller and as a filmmaker, you\u2019re always looking for new ways to bring new stories to the screen, new ways to engage audiences, new ways to surprise audiences, so what happened there in Mosul was so specific and so unique in the way the warfare played out there, and the complexities the characters had to deal with in terms of their allegiances, and who they were fighting against, and how they were fighting against them, that they had a very unique human experience happen. Nobody\u2019s ever seen those dynamics together in a war movie before, or this story happen on screen before.\n\nMany Americans\u2014purely out of ignorance\u2014view the conflicts in the Middle East broadly as this us-versus them, Christianity-versus-Islam thing. But in Mosul, by humanizing the Muslim fighters, it could help combat Islamophobia stateside.\n\nJoe Russo: I think media is the most powerful tool for combating Islamophobia, and for combating racism. People can feel things emotionally\u2014something that can override their brain. One of the great myths that was ever perpetrated is that there are multiple races. There are not. There is one race: the human race. Everybody looks exactly the same on the inside, and the most superficial criteria for trying to define a difference between people is pigmentation of the skin. It sounds insane. Those are the barriers that we have to break down.\n\nOr in the Quillette world, the shape of one\u2019s skull. I\u2019m kidding, of course.\n\nJoe Russo: Right. Whatever ridiculous criteria you\u2019re trying to use to define it, our job as storytellers is to break that down, to educate, and to show stories where everyone is human, and how we can all relate to one another. What\u2019s so tragic about what happened in Mosul is, this wasn\u2019t even their war! It\u2019s a war that we started\u2014and then we left. We left them to pick up the pieces with a bunch of radicals who aren\u2019t even from their country, and they have to drive them out, and their families are being raped and killed. It\u2019s a harrowing, harrowing story about heroism and the dignity of the human spirit, and everyone can relate to that no matter who you are.\n\nWith movies like American Sniper, or to a more extreme degree Green Berets, there\u2019s this history of war films in America being incredibly jingoistic, one-sided, and borderline recruitment tools.\n\nJoe Russo: They\u2019re like sports movies, right? It\u2019s a specific genre whose intent is to rouse the audience.\n\nAnthony Russo: It\u2019s kind of funny because that\u2019s basically the nature of warfare, right? It\u2019s one side versus another, with no compromise. It\u2019s the nature of the beast.\n\nJoe Russo: Just like sports: Your team is the good team. It\u2019s a very reductionist take.\n\n\u201c As we\u2019re seeing right now, when people get their hands on power they can abuse it in all kinds of different ways, so we have to be very careful about how much power we do allow them. \u201d\n\nOne thing I admire about you guys is you\u2019re the rare Hollywood filmmakers who take on the military-industrial complex. I think Winter Soldier is maybe the best MCU movie, and it\u2019s the first one that was critical of military overreach. With Iron Man audiences were lauding a weapons manufacturer, but Winter Soldier offered this dystopic vision of drone warfare.\n\nAnthony Russo: It\u2019s great to hear you mention Winter Soldier in that context, because perhaps the most gratifying moment in all our Marvel work came after when we were in a country that is not as free as other countries, and somebody came up to us and said, \u201cI love this movie because this movie could not be made here since it criticizes the government. We can\u2019t criticize the government.\u201d To have people feel empowered by this dynamic was so exciting. I don\u2019t know where it comes from. Even though our grandparents come over from Italy to the United States, our family\u2019s always maintained this immigrant mentality, so we were just brought up to think of America as a country of immigrants\u2014that people come from all corners of the world, and some people come from very difficult places. When our family left the South of Italy, it was a very poor, difficult area that was wrecked by the wars of the 20th century. So, I think it comes from this knowledge of global migration, and the fact that America presents an opportunity for freedom, especially freedom of expression, and we want to both celebrate that and hold America to the fire.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous how you can\u2019t really criticize the military in America without having your ass handed to you. Everyone should want it to aspire to be better, no?\n\nAnthony Russo: There are people high up who make very serious decisions in our country, and sometimes they make very bad decisions. You can\u2019t just cover up a bad decision because you don\u2019t want to look bad!\n\nJoe Russo: Power is intoxicating and that\u2019s dangerous. As we\u2019re seeing right now, when people get their hands on power they can abuse it in all kinds of different ways, so we have to be very careful about how much power we do allow them. Right now we\u2019re seeing that we need a few more checks and balances within the U.S. government to prevent abuses of power.", "description": "Anthony and Joe Russo, better known as the Russo Brothers, open up about their groundbreaking new war film \u201cMosul,\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cabuses of power,\u201d and more.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568359167/unnamed_8_nlupif", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
