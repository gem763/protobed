That'll give you some idea of what it\u2019s like to be Syrmor.\n\nThe Toronto native has become sort of an in-house talk therapist on VR Chat, a free game where you log in, choose an avatar, and drop into a virtual world to chat with people across the globe. It\u2019s almost completely unmoderated, which can make for some interesting, and occasionally terrifying, interactions.\n\nSyrmor picked up VR Chat in early 2018 out of curiosity and started recording the things he saw and uploading the results to YouTube. At first, his videos were focused on the bizarre, and he had a hand in propelling the viral (and arguably racist) \u201cUgandan Knuckles\u201d meme into the mainstream.\n\nBut one day, Syrmor stumbled into a VR conversation with a drunk man (who was using an anime girl avatar) who started crying about how wonderful life is.\n\n\u201cIt was like it was the most human and \u2026 memorable conversation I had in VR chat up until that point,\u201d Syrmor said in an interview with VICE News.\n\nSince then, Syrmor\u2019s channel has been a surreal peek into the deepest and darkest thoughts of complete strangers, spoken through avatars: A cute bird talking about being in the Korean military and mourning his brother\u2019s death, a Kermit talking about being bullied at school, a tall mushroom talking about what he wants his funeral to be like when he dies of ALS.\n\nThe comment section of his YouTube channel, now at over half a million subscribers, is overflowing with people who are surprised at how much Syrmor\u2019s videos are able to show them about other people\u2019s lives.\n\nVICE News took a tour through virtual reality with Syrmor to see what it\u2019s like to have cartoon pigs tell you their darkest secrets.", "description": "The \"Dr. Phil\" of Virtual Reality helps cartoon mushrooms talk about dying", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d72997dd412b700085a3bea/lede/1567791633687-PKG_SEG4569_DR_PHIL_OF_VR_090619_1230_CD_MASTER-COLOR01_00_19_21Still008.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
