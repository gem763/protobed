The collaboration isn't a surprise.\n\nMcDonald's will trial the P.L.T. (Plant. Lettuce. Tomato.), which features a Beyond Meat patty, in 28 restaurants in Ontario, Canada, starting on September 30. The pilot provides the \"first confirmation\" that McDonald's is testing Beyond Meat products, Jefferies said in a research note. It \"makes sense for both parties\" given the rising interest in plant-based options and Beyond Meat's \"strong capacity and production capabilities,\" which would be necessary for a nationwide rollout, the investment bank added.\n\nThe test could also pave the way for a full-blown partnership \u2014 Jefferies said the pair were \"well positioned\" for a deal in an initiation note in May. It argued one was likely for several reasons:\n\nMcDonald's launched a vegan burger in Germany earlier this year.\n\nIt expressed \"significant interest\" in plant-based protein and said it was paying \"close attention\" to the trend in comments earlier this year.\n\nDonald Thompson, McDonald's former CEO and COO, sits on Beyond Meat's board.\n\nRival Impossible Foods has struggled to meet demand, meaning it might struggle to satisfy McDonald's supply needs.\n\nBurger King launched Impossible Whoppers nationwide, piling pressure on McDonald's to match its archrival.\n\nJefferies estimated Beyond Meat could generate an extra $ 48 million in sales if it captured just 1% of McDonald's annual US beef sales, and $285 million if it snagged a 6% share.\n\nThe bank also predicted a partnership could add more than $25 to Beyond Meat's stock price of about $80 at the time. The startup's shares soared $16 to $154 in early trading on Thursday.\n\nWhile a deal might seem inevitable, McDonald's has downplayed the chances of one. \"It's so early days,\" CEO Stephen Easterbrook said at a conference in May. \"We're not putting ourselves under pressure to be any sort of first mover. I think getting it right is better than rushing it out.\"\n\nMcDonald's wasn't certain the plant-based meat trend was \"worth embracing\" at scale, given the risk of it being a fad rather than a sustained trend, and the added complexity for its kitchens, Easterbrook added.\n\nWith the launch of the P.L.T., McDonald's seems to have decided plant-based meat is worth a try.", "description": "Beyond Meat and McDonald's are testing a plant-based burger at 28 of the fast-food giant's restaurants in Ontario, Canada.
