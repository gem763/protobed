It is not clear where the video, taken in 2010, was filmed\n\nIt continues to squeak as onlookers laugh and one says: 'Aw, it's okay.'\n\nAs the animal lies back down, a male voice can be heard saying: 'That is one good-looking cat!'\n\nRachel Kane posted the footage to YouTube with the caption: 'I uploaded this video a few months ago. It was taken in December 2010 on a 'behind-the-scenes' tour at a zoo.\n\n'His sister had died shortly after their birth. He was a part of the third pair of cubs born to the pride that year.\n\nSomeone asks if the animals all make that sound and a zoo worker replies: 'It will turn into a growl later'\n\n'The cubs are routinely separated from their mother after birth in order to get them acclimated to their handlers and also to keep better eye on their growth and development.\n\n'The cubs were a part of an educational program at the facility geared towards school kids. He was eventually reunited with his mother and the rest of the lions.'\n\nWhen fully grown, a lion can roar up 114 decibels. This is around the same level of noise as a live rock concert.", "description": "The tiny cub was part of an education programme at a zoo, although it is unclear where the clip was taken.
