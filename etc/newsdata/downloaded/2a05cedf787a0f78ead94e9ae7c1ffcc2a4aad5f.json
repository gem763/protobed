So we're stopping these too.\"\n\nDorsey said the company took the action to head off potential problems from \"machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes.\"\n\nTwitter's move comes in contrast to the Facebook policy that allows political speech and ads to run without fact-checking on the leading social network.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said political advertising is not a major source of revenue but that he believes it is important to allow everyone a \"voice,\" and that banning political ads would favor incumbents.\n\nDorsey said he disagreed with Zuckerberg's assessment that stopping ads would favor incumbents.\n\n\"We have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow,\" he said.\n\nSocial media platforms have been challenged by President Donald Trump's campaign's use of ads that contain claims critics say have been debunked by independent fact-checkers.\n\nDemocrats have stepped up pressure on Facebook to remove the ads, and a group of Facebook employees has also called for stronger efforts to clamp down on \"civic misinformation\" from politicians.\n\nSome initial reaction to the Twitter announcement was positive.\n\n\"Until privately owned social media platforms can develop and consistently enforce standards to prevent demonstrably inaccurate information in political advertising, this is the right move,\" said Michelle Amazeen, a Boston University professor specializing in political communication.\n\nNina Jankowicz, a Wilson Center fellow specializing in disinformation, also welcomed the move.\n\n\"It's great that this move has been made globally and not just within the United States. Too often these companies operate in a cloud of willful ignorance about the effects their products have outside our borders,\" she said.\n\nJankowicz said the decision could level the playing field by preventing wealthier candidates and groups to dominate the social conversation.\n\n\"Paid speech essentially quashes some groups' ability to speak out and be heard because they can't compete with the reach that their richer counterparts pay for,\" she said.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Twitter said Wednesday it would stop accepting political advertising globally on its platform, responding to growing criticism over misinformation from politicians on social media.
