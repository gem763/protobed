The story did not mention how often he gets his hair cut.\n\nPeople of all political persuasions responded with a collective eye roll. They mocked the comparison to Sessions, urged the Washington Times to focus on Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s policy proposals and bemoaned the newspaper\u2019s disapproval of the congresswoman for doing exactly what society expected her to do.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSorry you don\u2019t get to create beauty standards that require women to spends hundreds or thousands a year to be considered presentable and then hate us for it,\u201d feminist writer Jessica Valenti tweeted.\n\nThe backlash to the congresswoman\u2019s hair appointment exemplifies a Catch-22 that experts say women in public life face: Either be criticized for spending exorbitant amounts of money to meet society\u2019s manufactured beauty standards or be lambasted for failing to fulfill those requirements.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is all completely consistent with the trap we\u2019ve created where we teach women that the most important thing they can be is physically beautiful, but also criticize them for responding to that pressure,\u201d said Renee Engeln, author of \u201cBeauty Sick\u201d and a psychology professor at Northwestern University.\n\nAD\n\nPaying $80 for a haircut and $180 for lowlights \u2014 darkening some strands of hair \u2014 would not be unusual in Washington. At two salons within blocks of Last Tangle on 19th Street, cuts cost $85. Another salon charged $50 for just a haircut or $75 for a cut and blow-dry. Highlights or lowlights at those salons cost $135, $165 and $175.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, whose annual salary is $174,000, took a swing at her critics Thursday, writing on Twitter that although conservatives wanted to blame Democratic socialists for the nation\u2019s income inequality, liberals\u2019 policies help working people. \u201cThey\u2019re just mad we look good doing it,\u201d she wrote, quoting a tweet about the Washington Times\u2019 reporting.\n\nAD\n\nThe congresswoman later shared a tweet by government watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit organization, that said Vice President Pence spent $600,000 of public funds in September for limousine service to President Trump\u2019s resort in Ireland.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* \u2014 not personal ones \u2014 to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cI wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut & color.\u201d\n\nWon\u2019t you look at that: Mike Pence used *taxpayer funds* - not personal ones - to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.\n\n\n\nI wonder if Republicans care about corruption as much as they care about a woman\u2019s cut & color. https://t.co/xBze4obZhv \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 10, 2019\n\nScrutiny of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s appearance is not new. A Washington Examiner reporter in November tweeted a photo of the congresswoman from behind and commented, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something: that jacket and coat don\u2019t look like a girl who struggles.\u201d The Internet erupted into a debate about people\u2019s biases regarding how professional women should dress.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike male professionals, who can wear similar suits every day, women are expected to vary their appearance regularly, Engeln said. The monetary and time costs of meeting societal expectations for women \u2014 including makeup, long hair, jewelry and matching purses \u2014 add up fast.\n\nAD\n\nCriticizing the appearance of a female politician like Ocasio-Cortez plays off stereotypes about women as fiscally irresponsible and implies that she can\u2019t be trusted with big decisions because she can\u2019t even spend the \u201cright\u201d amount of money on a haircut, Engeln said.\n\nWhen the focus is on a female politician\u2019s appearance, Engeln said, it distracts from discussions of ideas. The result is that powerful women are silenced, she said, and other women are dissuaded from entering the political arena.\n\n\u201cThis game is rigged,\u201d Engeln said. \u201cIt was never set up to be fair, and I think the best thing we can do is, to the extent that it\u2019s possible, just refuse to play. Women\u2019s lives are not beauty pageants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOcasio-Cortez and other female politicians face a conundrum, said Jaclyn Wong, a sociology professor at the University of South Carolina who studies gender inequality. They can be punished for refusing to participate in \u201cbeauty work\u201d such as getting a haircut, or they can be penalized for the amount of money they spend to do that work.\n\nThe effort people put into their physical appearance can affect their salary, Wong said. She said women who are well-groomed tend to earn more money than women who invest less in their appearances \u2014 a reward to women \u201cfor behaving the way we expect them to.\u201d\n\nAlthough women might be tempted to try to play by society\u2019s rules about their appearances to avoid criticism, Wong said this strategy rarely works and that women are better off calling out the unfair expectations they face.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to Ocasio-Cortez, Wong said, people who criticize her appearance often do so because they oppose her policies and perceive her as a threat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making her feel uncomfortable for just being a person and doing what she needs to do in this position of power,\u201d Wong said.\n\nCriticizing politicians\u2019 appearance-related spending, including the cost of their haircuts, is a popular way for people to make their political opponents appear elitist. A columnist for the New York Post in 2015 chastised Hillary Clinton, then a Democratic presidential candidate, after she was seen entering a salon where haircuts can cost $600.\n\nHer husband, former president Bill Clinton (D), was the subject of front-page news stories in 1993 when rumor spread that he had gotten a $200 haircut while Air Force One idled at Los Angeles International Airport, bringing many of the airport\u2019s operations to a standstill. Fact checks later found the haircut had not caused significant delays and probably cost significantly less than previously reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Republican-linked television ad attacking Democratic presidential nominee John F. Kerry in 2004 listed his $75 \u201cHairstyle by Christophe\u2019s\u201d as evidence that he was not the man of the people he claimed to be. John Edwards, then a Democratic presidential candidate, in 2007 was dinged in a news report for two $400 haircuts for which his campaign picked up the tab.\n\nCommentators seized on Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin\u2019s spending in 2008 when campaign finance reports showed the Republican National Committee had paid $150,000 for her designer wardrobe. Conservatives worried the revelation would hurt Palin\u2019s appeal to working-class voters.\n\nRead more:", "description": "The New York congresswoman's haircut reportedly cost about $300, which is not unusual for Washington.", "authors": ["Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LjAaZJPTTKvE40zFtUNj6QrefPM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OXODHAXGGUI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
