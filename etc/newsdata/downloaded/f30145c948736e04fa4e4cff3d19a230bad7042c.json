(Image: Netflix)\n\nBeing an actor on television can be challenging when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to the character you\u2019ve poured your heart and soul into for years. Which means that, like Millie Bobby Brown upon learning about the ending of the last season of Stranger Things, one\u2019s initial reaction to a surprise might not be a happy one.\n\nThat ending, which saw Eleven and her adopted family leaving Hopkins, was not Bobby Brown\u2019s favourite, she told Elle recently. \u201cI was pissed!\u201d she said. \u201cI read the script and I was like, \u2018What, how is this even possible? Why are they moving away?\u2019 They were like, \u2018Didn\u2019t you read episode 3?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Oh yeah.\u2019 Because Joyce said she wanted to move away from Hawkins. I don\u2019t know. I just felt really against it.\u201d\n\nOne Of Stranger Things' Best Ideas Came Late In The Game There were a lot of new team-ups in the third season of Netflix\u2019s Stranger Things, but the coolest one (literally) had to be between Steve (Joe Keery) and his badass Russian-translating coworker Robin (Maya Hawke). Their relationship seemed to be going in a certain direction as Steve developed feelings for his new best friend, only for it to evolve into something else. It turns out, that evolution is largely thanks to the actors themselves. Read more\n\nIt\u2019s not usual for an actor to talk quite this frankly about their confusion with a creative choice. Often, these impressions are taken out of context by angry fans, used as fuel for the show having gone in a bad direction. But these actors are themselves just trying to puzzle through difficult decisions, and that\u2019s a hard thing to do. Anger is a normal reaction to confusion. But it\u2019s not always a final one.\n\nBobby Brown also went on to talk about her feelings about a popular Stranger Things fan theory, which would see her become the villain the next season. She\u2019s intrigued, but it\u2019s not necessarily something she would want to happen to Eleven: \u201cI kind of like it! I\u2019m into it. I wasn\u2019t playing it like that. We don\u2019t know what happens in season 4. I definitely don\u2019t. In scenes after the Mind Flayer grabbed me, I wasn\u2019t playing it as I was infected. I was definitely playing it as normal as possible. And maybe that\u2019s the reason they didn\u2019t tell me. To make it as real as possible. I don\u2019t know. Those theories freak me out a bit. Because I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh god, that could genuinely be true.\u2019 And what if she is the villain? That would be so cool. Wouldn\u2019t that be cool? I\u2019d love to be the villain, but then I also wouldn\u2019t because Eleven is perfect. It would suck.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll find out if there\u2019s any truth to the rumour when the fourth season of Stranger Things, which takes the horror beyond the bounds of Hopkins, hits Netflix sometime in the future.", "description": "Being an actor on television can be challenging when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to the character you\u2019ve poured your heart and soul into for years.
