(PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nIt appeared to be a mismatch from the start. It turned into one of the most lopsided results in Premier League history.\n\nManchester City, the reigning Premier League champion and runaway favorite to repeat, entered Saturday\u2019s match with 16 goals and a 3-1-1 record in its first five league matches. Watford had four goals in six matches, two draws and four losses.\n\nCity dominated in every phase of an 8-0 win, the second-largest margin of victory in the Premier League after Manchester United\u2019s 9-0 thrashing of Ipswich Town in 1995. Five of City\u2019s goals \u2014 yes, five, of them \u2014 came in the first 18 minutes.\n\nWitness them now, in all their glory:\n\nGoal 1: Kevin De Bruyne whips in a cross so good, Watford keeper Ben Foster didn\u2019t know whether to try to grab it out of the air or to defend the goalmouth. So he did neither, and David Silva scored it in the first minute of the game.\n\nThat Kevin De Bruyne assist \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/saGC1Frg1Q \u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) September 21, 2019\n\nGoal 2: Another error by Foster, as Riyad Mahrez ran onto a pass in the box and Foster took his legs out with a tackle. Sergio Aguero scored the ensuring penalty in the seventh minute.\n\nGoal 3: Mahrez got on the score sheet in the 12th minute. His free kick from just outside the 18-yard box pinged off a Watford defender and past Foster.\n\nManchester City are up 3 within 12 minutes . . .\n\n\n\nWatch this one now on NBCSN, or stream it here: https://t.co/0Ab1OydWoK pic.twitter.com/mThR9bmWfb \u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) September 21, 2019\n\nGoal 4: Another beautiful set up from De Bruyne on a corner in the 15th minute. He found Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi at the top of the six-yard box, who knocked the ball further to Bernardo Silva for a back-post tap-in.\n\nGoal 5: The absolute cherry on top. City caught Watford napping again in the 18th minute. David Silva played a free kick from 35 yards out while the defense had its back turned. Sergio Aguero ran in behind the back line almost unnoticed, then slid a pass through the 6-yard box to Otamendi, who was unmarked.\n\nAfter five goals, City finally called off the attack for the rest of the first half. And in the second half, almost without trying, it scored three more goals.\n\nIn the end, Bernardo Silva had a hat trick. City completed 723 passes. Watford is still without a win and could be in danger of relegation if its poor play continues.\n\nRead more:\n\nHow Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting case changed animal welfare\n\nKansas to reportedly receive NCAA notice of major violations within basketball program\n\nIranian judo team suspended after athlete pressured to avoid fighting an Israeli\n\nIn diverse Toronto, the Raptors\u2019 sports hijab is hailed as a win for inclusivity", "description": "The 8-0 win was the second-largest margin of victory in the Premier League after Manchester United\u2019s 9-0 thrashing of Ipswich Town in 1995.", "authors": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer", "September At Pm", "Jacob Bogage Writes About Sports For The Post", "Where He Has Worked Since He Previously Covered The Automotive", "Manufacturing Industries For The Business Section."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JtRCMDoAmtnws5kkqbQJTSchxII=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OSVQVUW4QEI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
