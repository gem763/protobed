I don\u2019t want to look at the things back.\u201d Ma, a former English teacher, has previously said he will turn his attention to philanthropy, focusing on education in rural areas.\n\nIn an open letter announcing his resignation last year, Ma wrote: \u201cI still have lots of dreams to pursue. Those who know me know that I do not like to sit idle. The world is big, and I am still young, so I want to try new things\u201d.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s event, investors will be listening closely to any remarks given by Ma signalling how or if he will continue to be involved in the company. Observers expect Ma, known for his showmanship, to give an over-the-top performance. In an event in 2017, he dressed up as Michael Jackson and danced to the song Billie Jean.\n\nMa\u2019s rags to riches story has inspired a legion of tech entrepreneurs in China. He founded Alibaba with a group of friends in a shared apartment in Hangzhou in 1999 and struggled for years to get it off the ground. Eventually the company ushered in e-commerce to China, with the marketplaces Taobao and T-mall.\n\nMa\u2019s net worth is $38.4bn according to Forbes, making him China\u2019s richest man. His company, which listed in the New York stock exchange in 2014 in the largest IPO to date, has a market capitalisation of $460bn.\n\nMa\u2019s resignation comes at a time when growth of China\u2019s e-commerce industry has slowed, along with the broader economy, and the company faces more competition from other large tech firms. Alibaba has expanded into financial services, mobile payments, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\n\nMa, who announced his succession plan last year, surprised observers with his early retirement but he will not relinquish his hold over the company completely.\n\nHe retains 6.22% share of the company and will remain on the board of directors until an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in 2020. After that he will be part of a corporate governing body of 38 members that is separate from the board.\n\n\u201cThe thing I want this company to never forget \u2013 because we are at today\u2019s size. a lot of companies I learned why they fail,\u201d Ma said in the video posted on Monday. \u201cThey forget about dreams. It\u2019s the dreams that keep us working hard, its dreams that keep us never afraid of mistakes \u2026 of setbacks.\u201d", "description": "Charismatic 55-year-old entrepreneur to be replaced by Daniel Zhang at e-commerce firm", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/719790de85dcd691ffeaac692a6e02507771edd1/0_236_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8fd2051dac06cb7789365d94c3f3887", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
