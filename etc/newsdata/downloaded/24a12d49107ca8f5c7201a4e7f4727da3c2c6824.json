He refused to climb back down, and the fire service was called to bring him down with a ladder.\n\nIt wasn't clear whether the escapade succeeded in winning back the heart of the young woman, also 18, who had broken up with him by phone. The man is being investigated for trespassing and unauthorized contact with prisoners.\n\nRegional broadcaster NDR reported that the man was half-naked, having taken off many of his clothes to avoid getting caught on barbed wire.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
