Who apologised to who? And more importantly, when is their duet coming out?\n\nThe Take That star, who was a judge at the time, famously stormed off the show when Rylan made it through the first week of eliminations over contestant Carolynne Poole.\n\nThe pair are on good terms! (Picture: Twitter)\n\nAt the time he called Rylan a \u2018joke act\u2019 and gave incredibly harsh feedback, including: \u2018I\u2019m glad you learned the trick that when you pull the mic away \u2013 we don\u2019t hear what you\u2019re singing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRylan also blasted Gary on Twitter back then, saying: \u2018I\u2019d rather be \u2018absolute s***\u2019 than just stand there and sing the same old stuff every week on the spot\u2026 #boreme @GBarlowOfficial.\u2019\n\nThe reality TV star also hit back at the singer by getting a fake tattoo of Gary\u2019s face on his back for a photo shoot the same year, calling the former judge \u2018Gary Bore-low\u2019.\n\nRylan on The X Factor in 2012 (Picture: ITV)\n\nOn Xtra Factor that week, Gary took a swipe and fellow judge Louis Walsh for sending the elimination to deadlock.\n\nHe sniped: \u2018We always try and judge it on the last performance, that\u2019s the idea, how can you compare those performances?\n\n\u2018He (Rylan) clearly entertains some people. Let me tell you one thing, those kind of acts\u2026 they\u2019re not for me. When I came to do this job I wanted to be the one to find great talent and bring on the young singers.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
