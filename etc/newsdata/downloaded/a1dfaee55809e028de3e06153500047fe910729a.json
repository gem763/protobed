But I worked hard to get here. I promised myself that I would buy a home and build a better future for my kids, and I did it.\n\nThis is also the community where I was arrested and charged with illegal voting in 2016. After a one-day trial, a judge sentenced me to five years in prison for submitting a provisional ballot, even though it was never counted.\n\nAD\n\nThe whole thing felt like a nightmare. I kept thinking there had been a mistake. Never did I think casting a ballot was something that could get you in trouble.\n\nAD\n\nIt turns out that the state of Texas considered me ineligible to vote because I was on federal supervised release because of a previous tax fraud conviction. But no one had ever told me I couldn\u2019t vote. Not while I was in prison preparing to reenter society, and not while I was on supervised release.\n\nI finished serving my original sentence right before the 2016 election. I was busy working hard to rebuild my life. I was enrolled in classes, working long hours to keep my home and watching my older children graduate from high school. Voting wasn\u2019t really at the top of my mind at the time.\n\nAD\n\nBut my granny, aunt and mother have always preached about civic responsibility, so on Election Day, we went to the same polling place we always went to. I was confused when I was told I wasn\u2019t on the rolls, but a poll worker handed me a provisional ballot to fill out anyway and we went on our way.\n\nAD\n\nLittle did I know, I had just caught myself in a storm of anti-voter panic. Following the election, the government aggressively went after cases of alleged voter fraud, even though there has never been any widespread evidence of it \u2014 either in Texas or nationally.\n\nIn fact, the main problems with voter fraud don\u2019t come from regular citizens such as me. They come from people such as Russ Casey, Tarrant County\u2019s now-former justice of the peace, who pleaded guilty in 2018 to forging signatures to get his name on the ballot during his reelection campaign. Casey would have benefited from the position\u2019s power if he had gotten away with the fraud. Yet he was given just a slap on the wrist: five years of probation and no jail time.\n\nAD\n\nThe people who pay the price are folks such as me who believed they were doing the right thing. It\u2019s a life-altering price \u2014 a message our elected officials are trying to send to scare us away from the voting booth with harsh sentencing laws.\n\nAD\n\nTexas allows convicted felons to vote once they\u2019ve completed their sentences, including any \u201cparole or supervision.\u201d But neither of those terms, as commonly understood under Texas law, applied to my case, and I was never told that Texas considered me ineligible to vote before participating in the 2016 election. Just recently, I received for the first time a form from my supervised release officer stating that I am not allowed to vote while on federal supervised release. When I saw that form, I started to cry.\n\nWho knows whether the form was distributed because of my case. What I do know is that if I had been given that piece of paper from my supervised release officer back in 2016, I wouldn\u2019t be fighting to keep my family together and to keep my job and home. At the very least, this new form might help another person avoid the pain I have gone through. But we are far from a just system, and there\u2019s still work to be done.\n\nAD\n\nI never expected to be here as an advocate for voting rights. I had never been an activist before. But now that I know what the system can do to people, I have to use that knowledge to educate the next generation and to let them know what their rights are. I want to let them know that we can make a difference as a whole.\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s why when I had my welcome-home party after returning from prison this year (I had to serve extra time in federal prison because my illegal-voting conviction was considered a violation of the terms of my release), I had a voter-registration table there for younger adults. It was a party with a purpose. I see hope in the new up-and-coming generation. They\u2019re loud, and they speak out about their rights. They\u2019re making noise in a good way, because they know in their hearts that if our votes didn\u2019t matter, the system wouldn\u2019t be trying so hard to stop us.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: How Democrats can overcome Republican voter suppression\n\nJennifer Rubin: Just how big a problem is voter suppression?\n\nAD", "description": "I want to use my nightmare to empower people to use their right to vote.", "authors": ["Crystal Mason"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PtUfFkHdfXDi45UXX2kNQV2Rpgw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZDOYSUXBPEI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
