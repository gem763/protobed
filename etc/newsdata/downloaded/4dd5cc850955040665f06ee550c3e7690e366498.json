In 2010, the number of flats being built started to fall back again.\n\nHow big are new-build homes?\n\nAs well as the type of homes being built, floorspace remains a hot topic.\n\nThe average floor area for new-build homes was 92m\u00b2 in the three months to June. New-build homes had an average of 111m\u00b2 of space, while flats came in at around 63m\u00b2.\n\nSince 2012, the average floor area of new-builds has 'remained fairly stable', according to the data.\n\nHouse or flat? The proportion of houses and flats built in the UK since 2000\n\nFloorspace: Average floor area for new-builds since 2012, according to Government data\n\nAre we building enough new homes?\n\nUnder former Prime Minister Theresa May, the Government pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year to tackle the country's shortage.\n\nShadow housing secretary John Healey said the latest figures from the Government were concerning, adding: 'Falling housebuilding makes the case for a big public investment programme even stronger.'\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick Gower, a residential research associate at the estate agency Knight Frank, said: 'Amid the current political turmoil housebuilders must make judgments about what the sales market will look like years from now.\n\n'Most indicators suggest housing completions will continue to climb over the near term, but are very unlikely to meet the government's annual target of 300,000.'\n\nMeanwhile, Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter said: 'These house building figures show there is an almighty gap between the Government's 300,000 homes a year target and reality.\n\n'It's clear the private market alone will never deliver the number or type of homes we need - so the best chance the Government has of catching up with its target is to build social homes - the last time we built over 300,000 new homes was in 1969 when almost half was social housing delivered by councils and housing associations.'\n\nTarget: Under former Prime Minister Theresa May, the Government pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year\n\nEarlier this week, the IHS/CIPS construction index revealed the sector was 'mired in a downturn.'\n\nResearcher IHS Markit said its index of activity in construction, where below 50 shows decline, fell from 45 in August to 43.3 in September.\n\nThat was the weakest reading since April 2009 apart from this June and highlighted how Brexit uncertainty is affecting Britain's builders.\n\nIHS Markit's Joe Hayes said: 'Activity is being pulled down at its second-fastest clip for over a decade as firms are buffeted by client hesitancy, Brexit uncertainty and a weak outlook.\n\n'The commercial sector was a notable casualty in September, with building activity here falling at the fastest rate since April 2009, highlighting the damage of project delays and belt-tightening.\n\n'Low confidence has subsequently caused construction order books to fall substantially.'", "description": "The number of homes starting to be built in the three months to the end of June was 24 per cent lower than at their peak in March 2007.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
