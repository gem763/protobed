Away from the glitz of the club\u2019s impressive new stadium, and aside from their astonishing run to the Champions League final last season, Spurs have, unquestionably, regressed over the past few months.\n\nResults have often been poor, performances inconsistent and Mauricio Pochettino, once such an assured presence, has begun to show signs of agitation and restlessness.\n\nInevitably, then, all the talk is of his imminent exit: Spurs need a change, say the critics; Pochettino has done all he can, taken the club as far as it can realistically go, and his future should be elsewhere.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPerhaps, though, there is another way. Perhaps one of modern football\u2019s most intelligent, innovative and thoughtful coaches will push through this difficult spell, find solutions to the problems he faces and bring Tottenham back onto an upward trajectory.\n\nFor inspiration, Pochettino might look towards a compatriot, a man he played alongside for Argentina at the 2002 World Cup \u2013 coached, incidentally, by Marcelo Bielsa, a great influence for both. That man is Diego Simeone, who is now into his ninth year as Atletico Madrid manager.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Season rankings: Tottenham Hotspur 1/29 Season rankings: Tottenham Hotspur How did Tottenham\u2019s players perform this season? Ahead of their final match of the 2018/19 campaign, the Champions League final against Liverpool in Madrid, we give each member of the Spurs squad a rating out of 10. Getty 2/29 Mauricio Pochettino \u2212 9 No new signings. A delay to the new stadium. And the worst injury crisis he has ever faced in his managerial career. And yet Pochettino took it all in his stride, securing a place in the top four and leading Spurs to their first ever Champions League final. No wonder there were so many rumours that both Real Madrid and Manchester United wanted to recruit him earlier in the season. Getty 3/29 Hugo Lloris \u2212 7 There has been more than the odd high-profile mistake and his failure to deal with Mohamed Salah\u2019s cross at Anfield handed Liverpool all three points in an absorbing Premier League fixture. But he remains an outstanding shotstopper and his three consecutive penalty saves proved crucial to Tottenham\u2019s attempts to finish in the top four. Icon Sport via Getty Images 4/29 Michel Vorm \u2212 5 The 35-year-old has appeared just four times this season and has now been surpassed by Paulo Gazzaniga in the goalkeeping pecking order. Action Images via Reuters 5/29 Paulo Gazzaniga \u2212 6 Has impressed when called upon this season, asserting himself as Tottenham\u2019s number two goalkeeper while also winning his first Argentina call-up. Getty Images 6/29 Kieran Trippier \u2212 4 Began this campaign on a high having enjoyed a superb World Cup with England, so much so that he was being talked about as one of the best right-backs in football. That all seems a long time ago now. It has been a difficult season for the 28-year-old with his defensive vulnerabilities being repeatedly exposed. Has been linked with a move away from north London this summer. Getty 7/29 Danny Rose \u2212 6 Once one of Tottenham\u2019s most important players, Rose\u2019s contribution has declined in recent years, with Pochettino coming to prefer Ben Davies at left-back. But this season Rose has enjoyed something of a comeback, reclaiming his place in Pochettino\u2019s preferred starting XI and appearing to repair the combustible relationship he had with his manager. Getty Images 8/29 Toby Alderweireld \u2212 7 Has made close to 50 appearances in all competitions for Tottenham this season. Utterly invaluable to the club this season, although he is still yet to agree a contract extension and looks destined to leave this summer. Spurs will be hard-pressed to sign a replacement of similar quality. Getty Images 9/29 Jan Vertonghen \u2212 8 A genuine club legend. As dependable as ever at the back, but his season will forever be remembered for his stunning performance against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. Filling in at left-back, Vertonghen kept Jadon Sancho quiet all night, before scoring a wonderful goal to put Spurs in complete control of the Champions League Round of 16 tie. Getty Images 10/29 Davinson Sanchez \u2212 7 The Colombia international is still very raw and can struggle when isolated by opposition attackers, such as when Spurs were run ragged by Ajax in the first-leg of their Champions League semi-final. But he is still 22. He has such a big future and will be even more important to the club if Alderweireld does indeed leave this summer. Action Images via Reuters 11/29 Kyle Walker-Peters \u2212 6 The 22-year-old is highly rated at Spurs but he would have hoped for a better campaign, particularly given the struggles of both Trippier and Aurier. Walker-Peters will have been frustrated to have made just 10 appearances: should Spurs sign another full-back this summer he would do well to consider his future at the club. Getty Images 12/29 Juan Foyth \u2212 6 Has looked sublime in fits and bursts and is adored by Pochettino. Foyth was also called up to the Argentina national time for the first time this season. But the 21-year-old endured some testing times: conceding two penalties on his Premier League debut and receiving a red card in the shambolic loss to Bournemouth. REUTERS 13/29 Serge Aurier \u2212 5 So much hype, such little end product. A combination of injury woes and personal problems have seen the Ivory Coast international restricted to just eight league appearances this season. It is obvious Pochettino still does not completely trust him after a string of erratic performances following his move from Paris Saint-Germain in 2017. AFP/Getty Images 14/29 Ben Davies \u2212 6 Has lost his place in Tottenham\u2019s first-team to Rose in recent weeks. Still an important player, but after an inconsistent season he may fear the rumoured arrival of Ryan Sessegnon from Fulham. AFP/Getty Images 15/29 Harry Winks \u2212 7 Has struggled with injuries throughout the campaign, and is currently making his comeback from groin surgery. But what a player. Took on far more responsibility this term \u2013 in particular scoring a winning goal against Fulham in January \u2013 and was so evidently missed when kept out of the team due to injury. Formed a fine midfield partnership with Moussa Sissoko. EPA 16/29 Erik Lamela \u2212 5 Started the season reasonably well, scoring a consolation against Liverpool and then getting on the scoresheet against Brighton in the next game, only for injuries to keep him out through a significant portion of the second half of the season. Increasingly doubtful that he will ever remain fit enough to truly consolidate a place in this team. Getty Images 17/29 Victor Wanyama \u2212 6 Has unexpectedly re-emerged as a crucial player for Spurs over the past few weeks. The extent of the knee injuries he has suffered over the past two seasons mean he is unlikely to ever again reach the level that he hit in the 2016/17 campaign, but despite some shaky moments, he played an important role in the European victories over both Manchester City and Ajax. Getty Images 18/29 Georges-Kevin N'Koudou \u2212 4 Nkou-who? Made just one Premier League appearance, crossing the ball for Winks to score against Fulham, before disappearing on loan to Monaco. Has absolutely no future at Spurs. REUTERS 19/29 Eric Dier \u2212 5 A very disappointing season for an established first-team player. Was kept out for a long period due to appendicitis and it is difficult to see where he fits into Pochettino\u2019s preferred starting XI when everybody is fit. And there is still some confusion over whether he is best deployed as a midfielder or defender. Getty Images 20/29 Moussa Sissoko \u2212 8 Who on earth would have expected Sissoko to emerge as Tottenham\u2019s most important player this season? Has completely turned his Spurs career around. And while his finishing may remain woeful, Spurs simply would not have reached the Champions League final without him. (Credit too long, see caption) 21/29 Dele \u2212 7 A difficult season for Dele, who like many of his team-mates has struggled with injuries this season. He has also faded in recent weeks, perhaps as a consequence of playing so much football in the summer. But he remains one of the club\u2019s most important players, particularly when playing alongside a fully fit Kane. EPA 22/29 Christian Eriksen \u2212 7 Rumours of a summer transfer to La Liga along with a series of sub-par performances saw his stock fall among some Tottenham supporters. But he is still the heartbeat of this team and contributed so many important goals and assists, from his winner against Inter Milan at Wembley to his pass to Son Heung-min to break the deadlock in the club\u2019s inaugural match at their new stadium. REUTERS 23/29 Lucas Moura \u2212 8 A breakthrough season for the Brazilian. Scored a brace against Manchester United, a hat-trick against Huddersfield, and then repeated that trick against Ajax in one of the most incredible Champions League performances in history. A bit-part player at the beginning of the season, Lucas is now a regular starter and cult hero. PA 24/29 Oliver Skipp \u2212 6 The 18-year-old has made 10 appearances in all competitions in his debut season, performing admirably when called upon and providing two assists in the 7-0 FA Cup win over Tranmere. One for the future, perhaps alongside fellow academy product Winks. AFP/Getty Images 25/29 Mousa Dembele \u2212 5 An ankle ligament injury put paid to his Tottenham career, before an \u00a311m move to Guangzhou R&F in the winter transfer market. Action Images via Reuters 26/29 Son Heung-min \u2212 8 Tottenham\u2019s player of the season. Truly stepped up to the plate after Kane\u2019s untimely injury, scoring 20 goals in all competitions, including that priceless winner against Manchester City in north London. That he achieved so much and elevated his game to the next level in a season that saw him play in two major international tournaments with South Korea is nothing short of remarkable. (Credit too long, see caption) 27/29 Vincent Janssen \u2212 5 Perhaps a 5/10 is generous, but it was only in January that Pochettino said Janssen was \u201cnot in my plans\u201d and would not feature for the club again. Yet the club\u2019s injury crisis presented him with a chance that he took, with the Dutchman making three appearances before the end of the campaign. Almost certain to leave this summer. Getty Images 28/29 Fernando Llorente \u2212 6 What a rollercoaster season. Struggled as a stand-in for the injured Kane, scoring just one goal in 20 Premier League appearances, but delivered when it mattered in the Champions League, bundling the ball over the line at the Etihad against Manchester City. Another that is likely to leave this summer, but he will be remembered fondly in north London. REUTERS 29/29 Harry Kane \u2212 7 Still managed to score 17 Premier League goals despite missing a third of the season through injury. Tottenham\u2019s talisman \u2013 and yet he will look back on this campaign with regret after damaging his ankle ligaments once again.

Has a chance of returning for the Champions League final, but should Pochettino start him? Getty Images\n\nThe two are very different characters: Pochettino composed, reserved, and cerebral; Simeone aggressive, tenacious, almost hyperactive on the touchline. They motivate their players in different ways and might, on the surface, appear nothing alike.\n\nBut there are also many similarities. Both have instilled similar styles at their respective clubs, based on high, intense pressing and quick transitions \u2013 though Simeone\u2019s version is more cautious. They are from the same tactical school of thought and share many of the same beliefs. And both, most pertinently, have transformed their clubs, taking them over several years from mediocrity to the top of the European game.\n\nBack in 2017, Atletico were in the midst of a difficult transitional period, navigating a move to a new stadium and a two-window transfer ban. They had won La Liga, and twice reached the final of the Champions League, but there was an overwhelming feeling that Simeone could do no more. A year earlier, the Argentine had made the decision to reduce his contract by two years.\n\nSpeculation that he would leave for Inter followed and that has never really gone away. In fact, Simeone has been linked with the managerial job at San Siro so persistently that he even felt the need to address it in December last year. \u201cIt will definitely happen,\u201d he said. But not yet.\n\nSimeone has been wedded to Atletico from the start, committed to the project, determined to see it through to its natural conclusion, even if that meant enduring the frustration of transitional periods. They have been through another this summer, refreshing an ageing squad with new signings like Joao Felix and attempting to reinvigorate the Simeone era. Whether it will be successful remains to be seen, but the early signs are promising.\n\nThe salient point amongst all this is that Pochettino, despite Tottenham\u2019s sluggish start to the campaign, need not abandon six years of patient, carefully constructed work. He has taken Spurs from obscurity to the pinnacle of club football. All that has been lacking \u2013 as has been repeatedly pointed out \u2013 is a long-awaited trophy. If there appears to be any stagnation this year, it is only because the bar has been set so high.\n\n\u201cIf he [Pochettino] turned around tomorrow and said I've had enough of this, I'm pretty sure Real Madrid and Manchester United would be on the phone,\u201d former Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas told BBC Radio 5 Live following Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Southampton. \u201cHe'd probably double his wages and get a massive transfer kitty.\n\n\u201cThere's a reason why he wants to stay at Tottenham. He genuinely loves this project but he's not been backed, I don't think, in the way he thought he was going to be backed at the start of the season.\u201d\n\nLike Simeone, Pochettino is enamoured with his club. There is an attachment there: this Spurs team is his, formed in his image and created with the intention of taking the club to the next level. At Atletico, though, Simeone has been given the funds to make the necessary changes. Daniel Levy may need to provide Pochettino with more in order to keep things fresh.\n\nBut Spurs can certainly learn from Atletico. The two clubs have been on a similar path, but Tottenham appear to be in danger of ending this period of growth and gradual improvement prematurely. Now is not the time to panic; by now Pochettino should be trusted to guide the club back on course.\n\nThis is, without doubt, a testing period, but there have been many since Pochettino took charge in 2014. It would not be a fitting conclusion to a defining era in Spurs\u2019 history if he were to depart now in such a tame manner.\n\nAs with Simeone at Atletico, there is an inseparability about Tottenham and Pochettino. And there is no need to follow the trend of reactive, rash decision making in the wider football world.\n\nLongevity was once heralded as the ideal, but now it almost seems unfashionable. There is an assumption that every year, every season, will be an improvement on the last, that there will be no setbacks along the way. But that, as Pochettino and Simeone have experienced, is not always the case. Generally, both have learned valuable lessons from difficult periods and later used them to their advantage.\n\n\u201cWe've known each other for a long time and have competed as coaches in Spain,\u201d Simeone said of Pochettino in 2016. \u201cHis mind is fabulous. He has developed a philosophy of the game onto his team - hopefully that can continue to improve.\u201d\n\nSince then, Tottenham have navigated a tricky stadium move, reached a Champions League final and finished in the top four of the Premier League each season without fail, all while spending relatively little on new players. Given the opportunity of a slight rebuild \u2013 like that of Atletico\u2019s this summer \u2013 there is no reason Spurs cannot continue to be a force domestically and in Europe.\n\nAnd there is no reason they cannot do so with Pochettino still at the helm.", "description": "There is a feeling,\u00a0at Tottenham,\u00a0that things have gone a little stale.
