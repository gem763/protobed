(Photo: Marvel Studios)\n\nIn a movie like Avengers: Endgame, you\u2019re dealing in worlds, characters, and costumes that are all built from visual effects, to the point where even the office building from the Captain America vs. Captain America fight was all-digital. Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to celebrate the moments that were real. One character, arguably the greatest hero of Endgame, could have easily been a digital effect. Luckily for us, they\u2019re totally real.\n\nWe\u2019re talking, of course, about the rat. You know, the one that basically the entire movie in motion when it inadvertently freed Scott Lang from the Quantum Realm?\n\nIn an interview with Wired, Marvel Entertainment\u2019s visual effects producer Jen Underdahl revealed that the rat wasn\u2019t actually, as you might expect in a movie jam packed with them, a digital effect: it was a real, professionally trained rat.\n\nAccording to Underdahl, visual effects supervisor Dan DeLeeuw made a bet with a line producer that they could find a trained rat to perform the sequence, and the line producer kept insisting the rat would have to be digitally replaced. Guess who won.\n\n\u201cFor those of you who are curious, that is not a digital rat,\u201d Underdahl said. \u201cFor all the things that we do and for all the things that we replace, that is actually a practical acting rat. I don\u2019t have his name, but he\u2019s really there.\u201d\n\nBehold: The moment that changed everything. (Image: Disney)\n\nThe rat emerged as the surprise hero of Avengers: Endgame, one that director Joe Russo and writer Chriostopher Markus even joked about on the film\u2019s commentary track as being \u201cthe hero of the Infinity Saga.\u201d\n\nIt was a fluke moment, but one that set in motion a chain of events that led to the Avengers bringing half the universe back from extinction. There\u2019s even a fan theory that the rat was Loki in disguise, because no one could believe that some dumb rat walking on a remote was part of Doctor Strange\u2019s \u201c1-in-14 million\u201d chance of them actually beating Thanos.\n\nBut maybe it was. And now we know that hero was indeed a real one, in every sense of the word.", "description": "In a movie like Avengers: Endgame, you\u2019re dealing in worlds, characters, and costumes that are all built from visual effects, to the point where even the office building from the Captain America vs. Captain America fight was all-digital.
