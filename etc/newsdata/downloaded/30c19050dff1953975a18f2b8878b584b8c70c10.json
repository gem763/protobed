But it was good to be back out there, very enjoyable,\u201d said Pocock. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to work on there, I thought some of our shape was really good but it did get a bit stop-start at times, they put us under pressure and there\u2019s a couple of things at scrum time we\u2019ll work on.\u201d\n\nSamoa briefly threatened a repeat of the upset they achieved in their last match against the Wallabies in Sydney in 2011, with their resurgence in the second half after the first had ended with an unfortunate injury.\n\nStarting scrum-half Scott Malolua had a Test debut to forget, dislocating his shoulder in a tryline ruck to put his participation in the World Cup in serious doubt.\n\nHis replacement Polataivao made an immediate impact, though, scoring his first try in the 53rd minute after the Pacific islanders had dominated an attacking scrum and the second eight minutes later following a line-break from centre Reynold Lee-Lo.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough first half, we gave up four tries through mistakes and a quality side like Australia are going to capitalise,\u201d said Samoa skipper Tusi Pisi.\n\n\u201cThe boys have worked really hard over the last month and hopefully we can put in some good performances at the World Cup.\u201d\n\nAustralia came through relatively unscathed on the injury front although there will be some concern at Coleman leaving the field with what looked like a thumb problem after 56 minutes.\n\nCoach Michael Cheika, who led Australia to the final four years ago in England, will take reassurance from the fact that he fielded a side very different from that expected to start the World Cup opener against Fiji in Sapporo on September 21.\n\nThe Wallabies also face Wales, Uruguay and Georgia in Pool D, while Samoa are in Pool A with hosts Japan, Ireland, Scotland and Russia.", "description": "David Pocock made a successful return as the Wallabies bade farewell to Australia with a 34-15 victory over Samoa in their final match before the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9d10cf5cce47da93debd8eda0e20f03931eb72d/320_115_2482_1489/master/2482.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f03397eec932cacb5a7f10f75cc73574", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
