Their numbers were relatively small, but they came at a moment of already simmering rage, fuelled by a failing economy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Rather than targeting the government or any one political leader, protesters called out Lebanon\u2019s corrupt political class in its entirety. And they have spread throughout the diaspora, with solidarity protests erupting in London, Paris and New York, to name just a few.\n\nThey sang insulting songs about political leaders from every party, one after the other. They chanted \u201crevolution\u201d and \u201cthe people want the downfall of the regime\u201d, and in doing so galvanised the country in a way that few protest movements have in the past. According to some estimates, more than a million people have taken to the streets since Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe question isn\u2019t why we are here, the question is why wouldn\u2019t we be here,\u201d said Rami, a 24-year-old teacher, who did not want to provide his full name, at a protest in downtown Beirut on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing in this country that would keep us at home, that would keep us from going down to the streets,\u201d he added.\n\nThere is nothing in this country that would keep us at home, that would keep us from going down to the streets Rami, teacher and protester\n\nThat sentiment appears to be shared by many. Families with children, crowds of men on mopeds and motorbikes, young and old have all flocked to squares and streets around the country.\n\nInitial clashes between small groups of protesters have given way to mass demonstrations with a carnival atmosphere. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands came out in the biggest protest yet in the capital.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In an attempt to quell the protests, Saad Hariri, Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, announced a package of reform measures on Monday. They included cutting the salaries of top officials, and abolishing several state institutions.\n\n\u201cThe decisions that we made today might not fulfil your goals but for sure it achieves what I have been seeking for two years,\u201d Mr Hariri said.\n\nBut few protesters seem in the mood for piecemeal reforms. The combination of an acute economic crisis and decades of rampant corruption has pushed the country to the edge.\n\nLebanon has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world due to years of mismanagement. Unemployment stands at close to 25 per cent, and tens of thousands of educated young people leave the country each year due to a lack of opportunity.\n\nInequality has also risen sharply over the last decade. According to research by the World Inequality Lab, the richest 1 per cent in Lebanon receive approximately a quarter of the national income, making it one of the most unequal countries in the world.\n\nIn the last few months, the crisis has had a dramatic impact on people\u2019s daily lives. Fears of a US dollar shortage have sparked panic for businesses across the country. Petrol stations have closed down in protest at the rising exchange rate and bakeries have warned they will not survive.\n\n\u201cThe economic situation is s**t,\u201d said Fadwa Hawilo, 40, as she marched in downtown Beirut on Sunday.\n\nI came to protest because there is no work, there\u2019s no education. My children are growing up without a future Fadwa, mother and protester\n\n\u201cI came to protest because there is no work, there\u2019s no education. My children are growing up without a future. My husband hardly works; he might get one day and then the rest of the week he has no work.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the country\u2019s elite and political leaders have grown richer and richer. To fix the country\u2019s finances, they have frequently turned to taxes and levies on an already struggling population.\n\n\u201cTheir solution was to take from poor people like me,\u201d said Adel, a 70-year-old taxi driver in Beirut\u2019s Martyrs Square on Sunday, who also did not want to give his full name, explaining why he joined the protests.\n\n\u201cAs a taxi driver\u2026 first of all, I am 70 years old, and I am still behind the wheel. If I don\u2019t work for one day, I don\u2019t eat. I have to work in order to eat. There are no social services, no pensions, nothing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we are saying to them, rather than taking from the pocket of the poor, go take from the pocket of the well-off, those who stole money.\u201d\n\nThese economic grievances are nothing new, but what has changed is the target for the protesters\u2019 ire. Whereas demonstrations in the past have called for governments to fall, this time they are demanding that the entire system of sectarian leadership be replaced.\n\n\u201cWe have come to the streets to overthrow the corrupt government,\u201d said Mohammad Amin, a 19-year-old student who holds a part-time job at a money exchange shop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the whole situation \u2013 there\u2019s no electricity, no water, nothing. We have a class of people who are all corrupt.\u201d\n\nTap water in Lebanon is not drinkable, and there are scheduled daily electricity outages.\n\nThe protests this past week show a dramatic growth among the country\u2019s civil society movement in just a few short years. In 2015, tens of thousands protested over a months-long waste crisis. That too evolved into wider protests about corruption, but the YouStink movement, as it became known, failed to achieve a united front.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, it was mainly an educated middle class who came out. This time it started with the poorest and the unemployed,\u201d Dr Rima Majed, an assistant professor of sociology at the American University of Beirut, told The Independent.\n\nDr Majed argued that protests of the past few days \u201chave shown the start of the emergence of a new class-based alliance between the unemployed, underemployed, working classes and middle classes against the ruling oligarchy. This is a breakthrough.\u201d\n\nThere is also a significance in the protests spreading across the entire country, in places that many political leaders would consider to be dominated by their base.\n\n\u201cWhat is different here is that it started quite spontaneously,\u201d said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut.\n\n\u201cThe build-up is against the entire political leadership. Not just Tripoli and Beirut, but in towns across the country. We are hearing slogans about wanting to change the regime, everyone is being held accountable. This is quite significant.\u201d\n\nOne refrain chanted by protesters for the past five days puts that point more succinctly.\n\n\u201cAll of them means all of them,\u201d they sing.", "description": "The mass protests that have swept Lebanon in the past week began as a spontaneous outburst of rage.
