The Chinese were told this was because of domestic reasons, another person said.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He plans to visit Washington in the second week of October to meet Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for high-level negotiations, according to separate people familiar with that planning, and the two sides are aiming for a high-level meeting around Oct. 10.\n\nThe news about the cancellation came about an hour after President Donald Trump said he wasn\u2019t interested in \u201ca partial deal\u201d with China based on Beijing increasing its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. China\u2019s Vice Agricultural Minister Han Jun, a member of the trade delegation, said Saturday at an event in Washington that the farm tour had been discussed but not finalized, and the U.S. will extend an invitation for another time.\n\n\u201cNegotiations on the agriculture area went very well, and the two sides held thorough and candid communication,\u201d Han said at the event, according to Chinese media. He also said China is willing to expand agriculture trade with U.S. and deepen cooperation \u201con the basis of equality and mutual respect\u201d.\n\n\u2018Goodwill\u2019 Gesture\n\nU.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said Thursday that the Chinese delegation\u2019s farm tour represented a \u201cgoodwill\u201d gesture by Beijing.\n\nBut on Friday, the Montana Farm Bureau Federation said it was told by the Chinese embassy that the delegation \u201chad an adjustment of their agenda\u201d and would return to China earlier than planned. The Nebraska Department of Agriculture, which also had planned to host the delegation, confirmed their visit was canceled, too.\n\nU.S. farming has become a main target for Beijing, where leaders are cognizant of the political importance of rural American to Trump\u2019s re-election. China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on everything from American apricots to soybeans crimped demand at a time when producers have also suffered from extreme weather.\n\nBut Trump told reporters in a meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday that the dispute won\u2019t damage his 2020 bid for re-election. He said he wouldn\u2019t relent without reaching a \u201ccomplete deal\u201d with China.\n\nTrump said that while he has an \u201camazing\u201d relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, right now they\u2019re having \u201ca little spat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the voters understand that,\u201d the president added. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has any impact on the election.\u201d\n\nBad-Faith Accusations\n\nNevertheless, Trump said it would probably be \u201cpositive\u201d for his re-election prospects if the two countries can reach a deal.\n\nU.S. and Chinese negotiators held \u201cproductive\u201d talks on Thursday and Friday in Washington, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said in a statement. The U.S. is looking forward to hosting \u201cprincipal-level\u201d negotiations in October, according to the statement.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce called the meetings \u201cconstructive,\u201d and said both sides agreed to continue communication on relevant issues, according to a statement on Saturday. The ministry did not immediately respond to a fax about the farm tour and the dates for the next round of talks.\n\nTop White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said recent developments have created a \u201cpositive atmosphere\u201d surrounding the standoff, which has been fueled by accusations of bad faith from both sides.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s remarks Friday tempered any optimism that a partial deal may break the impasse. Administration officials previously have discussed offering an interim trade agreement to China that would delay and even roll back some U.S. tariffs in exchange for Chinese commitments on intellectual property and agricultural purchases.\n\nA limited deal would likely jolt markets and ease the economic burden caused by the conflict as Trump ramps up his 2020 re-election campaign. The president has repeatedly denied that the tariffs have hurt the U.S. economy, saying China is bearing the burden.", "description": "Chinese Trade Delegation Called Off Farm Visits at U.S. Request", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb5d06ebb052861e2c3cc3ebdfd9d5634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
