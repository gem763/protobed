And this deal means that there is no need for any kind of prolongation. This is a fair, a balanced agreement,\u201d he said, stood alongside Mr Johnson.\n\nMr Juncker said that the next phase of negotiations, on the UK\u2019s future relations with the bloc, would begin \u201cimmediately\u201d after MPs approve the deal.\n\nBut this appears to be an uphill challenge. Jeremy Corbyn was quick to dismiss the PM\u2019s agreement, criticising it for creating a customs border in the Irish sea.\n\n\u201cAs it stands we cannot support this deal,\u201d the Labour leader told reporters in Brussels, adding that it did not seem to have the backing of \u201cmany of his allies on his own backbenches\u201d.\n\nMr Corbyn criticised \u201cspeculation\u201d when asked about reports that his party could support the deal if it comes with a second referendum.\n\nNicola Sturgeon also ruled out her MPs in the SNP backing the deal, insisting it will mean Scotland alone is \u201ctreated unfairly\u201d when the UK leaves the European Union.\n\nThe PM\u2019s spokesman said Mr Johnson plans to hold a meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration on Saturday.", "description": "The DUP rejected supporting the agreement in Parliament in a strongly-worded statement.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/14/wire-19840148-1571320134-232_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
