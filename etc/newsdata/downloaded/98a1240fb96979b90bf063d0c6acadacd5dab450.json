Santa Barbara County Fire Department\n\nAuthorities have said they are looking at several factors in their investigation, including how batteries and electronics were stored and charged. They will also look into how the crew was trained and what crewmembers were doing at the time of the fire, which erupted in the middle of the night as the passengers slept.\n\nThe boat's design will also come under scrutiny, particularly whether a bunkroom escape hatch was adequate.\n\nThe FBI, Coast Guard and U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles are conducting a criminal investigation, and the Coast Guard has convened a formal Marine Board of Investigation.\n\nThe four members of the board will look into \"pre-accident historical events, the regulatory compliance of the Conception, crewmember duties and qualifications, weather conditions and reporting, safety and firefighting equipment, and Coast Guard oversight.\"\n\nThat investigation is expected to take at least a year. The panel will seek to determine the factors that led to the fire, any possible evidence of misconduct, inattention to duty, negligence or willful ignorance of the law, and if any other factors caused or contributed to the deaths.\n\nCoast Guard records show the Conception passed its two most recent inspections with no safety violations. Previous customers said the company that owns the vessel, Truth Aquatics, and the captains of its three boats, were very safety conscious.", "description": "Authorities confirmed Wednesday that all 34 bodies had been recovered; five of the boat's crew members survived the blaze", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/05/8fb30de8-a2ec-49ea-9bae-c3d51e45365d/thumbnail/1200x630/906a6a172b3ee7fd9f348ca8ff8a968f/0905-caboatfire-kvc-1927657-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
