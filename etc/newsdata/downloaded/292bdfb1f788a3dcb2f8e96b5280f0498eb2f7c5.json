We just like not wearing makeup, as well as wearing makeup now.\"\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAnd Leigh-Anne added: \"It takes a lot of effort to keep worrying about things. As soon as you think, 'You know what? Forget it', life becomes a lot easier.\"\n\nIt comes after the songstress revealed she attempted suicide following online abuse which included a horrific tweet from Katie Hopkins.\n\n(Image: instagram)\n\nJesy says that this led to a \u201cpinnacle point\u201d where she spiralled out of control and tried to end her life. Speaking about the Hopkins tweet, she says: \u201cAll I remember feeling at that time is what\u2019s the f***ing point.\n\n\"I\u2019ve starved myself for a week and I\u2019m still getting called fat. I could be the skinniest girl in the world and this is never going to go away.\n\n\u201cThat is the pinnacle point for me when I got severely depressed and it just spiralled out of control.\u201d\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nAfter leaving a restaurant with her mum and feeling everyone was talking about her, Jesy went home and couldn\u2019t see light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBreaking down in tears, she continues: \u201cI was sat in bed thinking this is never going to go. I\u2019m going to constantly wake up and feel sad for the rest of my life so what is the point in being here. There is no point in waking up and feeling sad everyday.\n\n* Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
