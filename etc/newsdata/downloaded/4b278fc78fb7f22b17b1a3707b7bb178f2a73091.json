It makes just about everything a little better. The song was penned by Nicholas Britell, the mastermind behind last year's transcendent Beale Street score, and the detuned piano melody is enough to make even the lowest Gregs among us want to whip up a quick double Windsor and organize a corporate coup.\n\nBut it turns out that even the best things have room for improvement, because on Monday, Pusha T announced that he had remixed the Succession theme song\u2014and HBO better use it during the opening credits for the season two finale next week. Just listen to the 30-second teaser of \"Puppets (Succession Remix)\":\n\nThe track\u2014which features Pusha rapping about family, fortune, and felonies, among other equally Succession-appropriate themes\u2014won't be out until Friday, but everything we can get from the teaser fully slaps. Britell told Vulture that \"there was only one person on the list of people to reach out to [for the remix],\" and, well, \"of course it had to be Pusha.\"\n\nHe was right. The only thing that could make this song any better would be if Kendall Roy randomly shows up for a verse on the full version of \"Puppets.\" Pusha himself put it best in the interview with Vulture: \"The show is dope.\"", "description": "But does Kendall get a verse?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9b74d3e31505000ab4cde7/lede/1570472367535-Screen-Shot-2019-09-30-at-94835-AM.jpeg?crop=0.999746514575412xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
