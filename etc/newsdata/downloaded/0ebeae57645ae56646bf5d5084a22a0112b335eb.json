First, the \u201cDemocracy dies in the dark\u201d outlet spent its Sunday apologizing for the glowing obituary lede it gave the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorist, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, \u201can austere religious scholar\u201d who murdered himself and three children by suicide vest when cornered by U.S. forces. Then yesterday, the Post saw the victory it had achieved earlier this year in the defamation suit brought by Covington Catholic teen Nick Sandmann evaporate.\n\nSandmann had sued the Washington Post after the Post and a bevy of other media outlets cast him \u201cas a smirking MAGA-hat-wearing racist who had blocked Native American elder Nathan Phillips\u2019s path\u201d to the Lincoln Memorial,\u201d I reported in July. At the time, Sandmann and his Covington Catholic High School classmates were waiting for their bus after having attended the March for Life in D.C. A short clip of the incident \u201ccaptured Phillips playing his drum and singing in the center of the group of Covington Catholic students,\u201d and Phillips told reporters \u201cstudents had swarmed him as he attempted to make his way up to the Lincoln Memorial.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post ran Phillips\u2019s tale and either linked to or referenced the video snip that had since gone viral. Later, however, full videos came to light that captured the entire incident, and those \u201cshowed that Phillips had not attempted to make his way to the Lincoln Memorial, but had instead marched into the group of students and stood in front of Sandmann, beating his drum and singing.\u201d\n\nWhile the Post and other media outlets quickly issued corrections, the teenage Sandmann had already been \u201cbranded a smirking racist and rendered a subject of scorn throughout the country.\u201d\n\nSandmann proceeded to sue the Washington Post, and others who ran Phillips\u2019 false claims, for defamation. His suit against the Post proceeded in a federal district court in the young man\u2019s home state of Kentucky. In July, Judge William Bertelsman, a semi-retired Jimmy Carter appointee, tossed Sandmann\u2019s case.\n\nIn a 30-page opinion, Judge Bertelsman held that, as a matter of law, Sandmann could not prevail against the Washington Post on his defamation claim. The court reasoned that Sandmann\u2019s claim failed because the Post\u2019s articles were not statements \u201cconcerning\u201d Sandmann, as they referenced the group of students or did not include a name or picture of Sandmann. He further ruled that the Post\u2019s reporting of the incident was \u201cnot factual\u201d because they could not be proven \u201cobjectively incorrect.\u201d\n\nJudge Bertelsman\u2019s original opinion was ripe for reversal by Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. But Sandmann\u2019s attorneys, Todd McMurtry and Lin Wood, opted against appealing immediately, and instead asked Judge Bertelsman to reconsider his decision. Sandmann\u2019s lawyers also requested permission to file an amended complaint.\n\nYesterday, over the Washington Post\u2019s opposition, the court granted both motions, set aside its earlier decision dismissing Sandmann\u2019s defamation case and accepted Sandmann\u2019s amended complaint. In reinstating Sandmann\u2019s defamation case, the court stressed that the amended complaint relied on the same 33 statements the Post had made in the original complaint.\n\nJudge Bertelsman then noted that after giving \u201cthis matter careful review,\u201d he had decided that Sandmann sufficiently alleged a claim for defamation against the Post based on the statements identified as \u201cStatements 10, 11, and 33,\u201d \u201cto the extent that these three statements state that plaintiff \u2018blocked\u2019 Nathan Phillips and \u2018would not allow him to retreat.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll three statements consisted of the Washington Post repeating Phillips\u2019s fabled encounter with Sandmann. In what was identified as Statement 10, the Washington Post wrote: \u201cIt was getting ugly, and I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to find myself an exit out of this situation and finish my song at the Lincoln Memorial,\u2019 Phillips recalled. \u2018I started going that way, and that guy in the hat stood in my way and we were at an impasse. He just blocked my way and wouldn\u2019t allow me to retreat.\u201d\n\nStatement 11 consisted of the Post publishing Phillips\u2019s recounting of the event as such: \u201cA few of the young people chanted \u2018Build that wall, build that wall,\u2019 the man said, adding that a teen, shown smirking at him in the video, was blocking him from moving.\u201d The final statement, Statement 33, also quoted Phillips\u2014as well as misstating his war record\u2014\u201cPhillips, who fought in the Vietnam War, says in an interview \u2018I started going that way, and that guy in the hat stood in my way and we were at an impasse. He just blocked my way and wouldn\u2019t allow me to retreat.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn ruling that these statements were sufficient to allow Sandmann\u2019s case to move forward, the court also noted that in his amended complaint, Sandmann alleged in great detail \u201cthat Phillips deliberately lied concerning the events at issue,\u201d and that but for the Washington Post\u2019s negligence or malice, they would have realized as much.\n\nSandmann\u2019s case is far from over. Now, the parties must engage in the costly and time-consuming process of discovery. And that\u2019s where things could get really interesting\u2014when the Post is forced to hand over internal communications concerning its reporting on the MAGA-hat-wearing Sandmann and his Catholic classmates who had just attended the March for Life.\n\nFor now, though, Nick\u2019s father, Ted Sandmann, is just grateful Judge Bertelsman took the time to reconsider his ruling. \u201cWe are invigorated and united in our purpose to achieve justice for Nicholas and the other Covington Catholic boys so slandered by the Washington Post and other news organizations,\u201d the senior Sandmann told me. \u201cThis is a huge win for justice and for the Sandmann family,\u201d attorney Todd McMurtry noted, adding that \u201cLin Wood and I are united in our desire to obtain justice for Nicholas.\u201d", "description": "Yesterday, the Post saw the victory it had achieved earlier this year in the defamation suit brought by Covington Catholic teen Nick Sandmann evaporate.", "authors": ["Margot Cleveland"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nicholassandmann1029.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
