As a May note from Barclays said, 44% of people surveyed said they\u2019d wait a year or more to fly on the 737 Max when it came back. In Europe, the numbers are worse.\n\nSo how can you know what kind of plane you\u2019re flying so you can avoid the 737 Max?\n\nA number of grounded Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft are shown parked at Victorville Airport in Victorville, California, U.S., March 26, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Blake TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY More\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s good to know what airlines fly 737 Max planes. The biggest buyers in the U.S. are Southwest Airlines with 34 and American Airlines with 24. United has 14 of the larger 737 Max 9 planes. Air Canada has 24, Norwegian has 18, and Turkish Airlines has 12, and many other airlines operate them as well.\n\nThis will change if and when more planes deliver, but Boeing\u2019s website has a list of orders and deliveries by airline. If you\u2019re considering one airline, you can see if the company owns any, though sometimes airlines lease planes instead of owning.\n\nBuying on airline websites\n\nIf you\u2019re flying on an airline that flies the 737 Max, you can almost always see what plane you will take when you buy your ticket.\n\nWhen selecting tickets on Southwest, for example, you can click the flight number and you\u2019ll get a bunch of information, including stats about on-time performance. There is an asterisk, however: \u201cUntil the MAX8 aircraft returns to service, Southwest plans to operate MAX8 flights with a different aircraft type,\u201d the fine print reads. \u201cFlight schedules and aircraft type remain subject to change per the Contract of Carriage.\u201d\n\nSouthewest's website gives on-time information as well. (Screenshot via Yahoo Finance) More\n\nThis likely means that this flight uses the 737 Max if it weren\u2019t grounded, and that a passenger doesn\u2019t have a say if that changes. The contract of carriage for Southwest, which is essentially the terms of use for flying, says the airline \u201cmay need to substitute other aircraft\u201d \u201cwithout prior notice.\u201d\n\nThat means if you end up with a 737 Max that you don\u2019t trust, the airline could refuse a refund.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines' website.
