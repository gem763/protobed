The same way many of them will be the first from their families to go to college, they'll be the first to learn how to swim, too, she said. Goldner has only been teaching lessons since March, but she's already seeing success stories. One of her students had never been able to join his friends in the lake at the camp he goes to every summer. But this year, after Goldner taught him how to swim, he got to swim with his friends for the first time, she said.\n\nWhile Goldner doesn't have any previous teaching experience, she's logged plenty of hours in the pool and is a certified lifeguard.\n\n\"I did get a book all about how to teach swim lessons, but just being in the water every day, it comes super easily,\" she said.\n\nShe starts by addressing her classmates' fear of the water.\n\n\"I had a few students who started shaking and trembling the first time they got in the water. It's scary for them!\" she said. \"So in the beginning, it's all about showing them how the water is a place of fun and there's nothing to be scared of. Then we start getting into skills.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Goldner raised more than $7,000 through a fundraising website to pay for lane space at the fitness center and purchase caps and goggles for her students. Her goal is to offer lessons every day of the week, but she knows she'll need more teachers and more money to do so. Her parents have been helpful, and so has her school \u2014 her principal sends email blasts to make sure students know about the lessons. Goldner has also reached out to the New York City Department of Education to inquire about potential funding and partnerships.\n\nBut for now, she'll start her next session in October, teaching one class a week. And she'll keep trying to spread her love of the water to other young people, one stroke at a time.", "description": "Sylvie Goldner started First Strokes after learning some of her peers at her New York City high school had never learned to swim.", "authors": ["Rheana Murray", "Rheana Murray Is A Senior Lifestyle Reporter For Today At Nbc News.
