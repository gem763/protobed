The group has previously been attacked for endorsing \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d an often discredited practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation.\n\nNFL STAR DREW BREES ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO 'LIVE OUT YOUR FAITH,' BRING BIBLE TO SCHOOL\n\nAn article in The Christian Post, however, cited a 2018 study that suggested sexual orientation change efforts have improved the mental health of mostly Christian men who have struggled with sexual identity issues.\n\nBut after critics targeted Brees on social media for associating with the group \u2013 with some accusing the former Purdue University star himself of being anti-gay -- Brees posted a second video Thursday, this time on his own Twitter account.\n\n2019 NFL SEASON OUTLOOK: TEAM BY TEAM PREVIEWS, BETTING ODDS AND MORE\n\n\u201cHopefully this sets the record straight with who I am and what I stand for,\u201d Brees wrote above the video. \u201cLove, Respect, and Accept ALL. I encourage you not to believe the negativity you read that says differently. It\u2019s simply not true. Have a great day.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Brees says: \u201cI do not support any groups that discriminate or that have their own agendas that are trying to promote inequality.\u201d\n\nBrees then spoke with reporters in an attempt to further clarify where he stands.\n\nHe said he believes he was unfairly and mistakenly accused of being anti-gay, and that he participated in the video solely to promote Bring Your Bible to School Day, not to endorse \u201cany type of hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that there are, unfortunately, Christian organizations out there that are involved in that kind of thing,\u201d he said, according to ESPN. \u201cAnd to me, that is totally against what being a Christian is all about. Being a Christian is love, it\u2019s forgiveness, it\u2019s respecting all, it\u2019s accepting all.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted on YouTube, Jim Daly of Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Focus on the Family also clarified that the organization is not a hate group.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to say, \u2018Jesus loves you, cares about you, no matter who you are \u2014 your race, your creed, your sexual orientation. Jesus died for every one of us.\u2019 That's the message we want to get out,\" Daly said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first off-the-field controversy for Brees. In 2016, he was the subject of an ESPN investigation titled, \u201cDrew Brees Has a Dream He\u2019d Like to Sell You,\u201d a story examining his ties to AdvoCare, a company linked to a multimillion-dollar pyramid scheme.\n\nIn June, Brees was awarded $6 million after claiming he had paid $15 million to a California company for overpriced diamonds.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.", "description": "NFL quarterback Drew Brees defended himself this week after critics slammed a video in which the New Orleans Saints star encouraged Christian students to participate in Bring Your Bible to School Day.", "authors": ["Dom Calicchio"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/100415-NFL-New-Orleans-Saints-quart-3c5191c7f3090510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
