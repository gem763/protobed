(AP) - Preston Rice threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns, including back-to-back scoring passes as Murray State wrapped two touchdowns around a defensive stand and went on to defeat Eastern Illinois 24-17 Saturday.\n\nEastern Illinois had taken a 10-9 lead on Josh Delgado\u2019s 30-yard field goal after halftime when Rice engineered a lightning-quick 75-yard drive in four plays, capped by Rice\u2019s 12-yard TD pass to Jam Sappington.\n\nMurray State (3-3, 1-1 Ohio Valley Conference) held the Panthers on downs - allowing only seven yards on a fourth-and-9. Rice then capped a 12-play drive with a 23-yard TD pass to LaMartez Brooks. Sappington caught the conversion pass and the Racers led 24-10 with 10 minutes left.\n\nChris Walker scored on a 3-yard run as the Panthers (0-6, 0-2) closed to 24-17, but their 11-play final drive ended with first-and-goal at the 5 as time expired.\n\nHarry Woodbury finished 30-of-49 passing for 231 yards and a TD for Eastern Illinois.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Preston Rice threw for 274 yards and three touchdowns, including back-to-back scoring passes as Murray State wrapped two touchdowns around a defensive stand and went on to defeat Eastern Illinois 24-17 Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
