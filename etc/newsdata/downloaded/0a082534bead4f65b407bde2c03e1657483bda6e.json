REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\n\nMorales, 59, who swept to power in 2006 as the country\u2019s first indigenous leader, claimed victory in the Sunday vote and railed against the opposition who he accused of leading a coup d\u2019etat with foreign backing.\n\nAnti-government protests had begun on Sunday, when an official vote count was suspended for almost a day. A confident Morales said then his socialist party MAS would get an outright win, despite an official rapid count data showing the left-wing leader heading to a second round against rival Carlos Mesa.\n\nThe final official count showed Morales with an over 10-point over Mesa on Thursday night, which meant he would avoid a risky second round head-to-head - even as the election monitors, the opposition and foreign governments criticized the count.\n\nOn Friday, roads in the north and south of La Paz were blocked by protesters, with normally busy streets empty of cars. In the morning, there were few signs of violence, as people marched with banners saying \u201cNo to dictatorship\u201d.\n\nThe official election observer, the Organization of American States, has already called for a second round despite Morales\u2019 10-point win, while the United States, European Union, Brazil and others adding their voice.\n\nIn the region, left-leaning governments in Mexico and Venezuela have backed Morales, a former union leader for coca farmers who has overseen steady growth and relative stability in one of South America\u2019s poorest countries.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a second round,\u201d Marco Antonio Fuentes, a departmental official in La Paz, said Friday. \u201cThe electoral arbitrator is unfortunately not reliable,\u201d referring to the vote count halt that saw one senior electoral official resign.\n\nMesa, a former president who leads the Citizen Community party, has claimed to have evidence of electoral fraud. \u201cThe government is despising the popular vote,\u201d he told local television channel Unitel on Friday.\n\nThe vote count, with 99.99% of the votes counted, showed Morales with 47.07% of the vote to Mesa\u2019s 36.51%.\n\nOfficials and diplomats raised concerns the conflict could hit Bolivia\u2019s ties with global trade partners and an economy that is already straining under declining gas exports.\n\nJaime Duran, a fiscal and budgetary deputy minister, said in comments to the Red Uno channel that the conflict in recent days \u201cwill undoubtedly\u201d have an effect on the economy, though reassured there no issues with supplies of fuel and food.", "description": "Bolivians blocked streets in La Paz on Friday demanding an audit of a controversial election count that handed President Evo Morales a outright win and with it a fourth consecutive term that would extend his rule to nearly two decades.", "authors": ["Danny Ramos", "Vivian Sequera", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444992846&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1RH", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
