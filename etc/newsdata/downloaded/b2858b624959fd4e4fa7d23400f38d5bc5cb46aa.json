Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine this sequence of events and their reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that were appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\u201d the committee chairs wrote in a letter to Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper.\n\nMr. Esper and Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, have until Oct. 15 to comply with the subpoena, according to letters sent by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees.\n\nThe committees are seeking documents related to the July 25 phone call as well as an April 21 conversation between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; communication between administration officials discussing the July 25 conversation; and documents related to any other conversation between the two presidents.\n\nIn June, the Trump administration froze the $250 million military aid package.\n\nDemocrats have alleged Mr. Trump withheld funds to compel Ukraine to probe the Bidens.
