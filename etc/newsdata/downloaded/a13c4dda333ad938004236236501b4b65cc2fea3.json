Apple's Arcade offers the same price point, pitting the tech behemoths against the firms now dominating the game-streaming industry.\n\nArcade joined Apple's App Store on Sept. 19, giving subscribers the ability to play more than 100 exclusive games that can also be downloaded and played offline on the iPhone, iPad, iMac and Apple TV.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Play Pass, which gives users access to more than 350 games and apps, hit Android devices in late September. Google appealed to new buyers with a limited-time offer of $1.99 a month for one year and $4.99 a month afterward. The service holds well-known games such as Risk and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % SNE SONY 57.96 -1.17 -1.98% AAPL APPLE INC. 224.59 +0.62 +0.28% GOOGL ALPHABET INC. 1,206.00 -15.14 -1.24%\n\nStarting today, PlayStation Now, which is available on PlayStation4 systems and PC, will be offered at the following prices.\n\nUS: $9.99 \u2013 monthly / $24.99 \u2013 quarterly / $59.99 \u2013 yearly <em>(from 19.99/ 44.99/ 99.99)</em>\n\nEU: \u20ac9.99 \u2013 monthly / \u20ac24.99 \u2013 quarterly / \u20ac59.99 \u2013 yearly <em>(from 14.99/ (N/A)/ 99.99)</em>\n\nUK: \u00a38.99 \u2013 monthly / \u00a322.99 \u2013 quarterly / \u00a349.99 \u2013 yearly <em>(from 12.99/ (N/A)/ 84.99)</em>\n\nJP: \u00a51,180 \u2013 monthly / \u00a52,980 \u2013 quarterly / \u00a56,980 \u2013 yearly <em>(from 2,500 / 5,900/ (N/A))</em>\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cWe have accumulated a wealth of knowledge in cloud gaming since PlayStation Now\u2019s launch in 2014,\" Sony Interactive said. \"That, coupled with our 25-year legacy in the games business and strong partnerships we\u2019ve forged with publishers, positions us to continue leading and innovating in this field as the gaming industry evolves,\u201d Ryan added.", "description": "In an effort to compete against rivaling streaming services, Sony is slashing the price of their pioneering cloud game subscription service\u2013 by half.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/playstation-now.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
