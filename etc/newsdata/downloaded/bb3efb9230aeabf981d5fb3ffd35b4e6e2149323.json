Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Queens district attorney candidate Tiffany Cab\u00e1n were among those who spoke against the plan, which united the Council\u2019s most liberal and conservative members in opposition.\n\nBut calls for change dominated the debate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I am overstating it when I say that for many of us, this is one of the most significant votes of our careers,\u201d Council Speaker Corey Johnson said in City Hall\u2019s packed Council Chambers. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of a new, more humane era for our city.\u201d\n\nClosing the facilities promises to add an important chapter to de Blasio\u2019s legacy, one that aligns him with allies who embraced his police reform platform in 2013 but have cooled to his policies as mayor.\n\nDuring his six years in office, he effectively expanded pre-kindergarten, improved upon the low crime rate he inherited and financed a significant amount of rent-regulated housing. But his tenure has been largely devoid of the kind of dramatic action that will change the course of the city, until now.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic step forward in our city. The vote we take today is going to affect communities for generations, and it will put us on a path for more equitable and just treatment of our fellow New Yorkers,\u201d Council Member Steve Levin, whose district includes the Brooklyn House of Detention, said before the vote.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer to close Rikers Island,\u201d Levin added. \u201cThe unconscionable treatment of people detained in the jail, the outdated and inhumane conditions and the severe isolation of an island away from family members and legal services necessitates that we close it as soon as we can.\u201d\n\nIt would have been virtually impossible, during the crack epidemic and surging violence of the 1980s and \u201890s, to imagine a successful push to close Rikers Island. The plan is only possible through policies that enable the city to reduce its jail population \u2014 from roughly 11,000 in 2014 to 7,000 today and a goal of 3,300 by 2026 when Rikers would be closed.\n\nBut a steady drop in violent crime \u2014 295 murders last year, compared to 673 in 2000 and 2,245 in 1990 \u2014 has provided room for a political consciousness about the failings of the criminal justice system, which paved the way for Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\nThe abuse at Rikers was underscored by Kalief Browder, who hung himself in 2015 at the age of 22 after spending two years in solitary confinement awaiting trial for allegedly stealing a backpack. He was the first of a list of names Council Member Danny Dromm read aloud before declaring his support for closing the jail complex.\n\nThe vote took place after three hours of emotional deliberation. Proponents shared personal stories about the brutality of life in the detention facility.\n\nCouncil Member Diana Ayala, whose Bronx district will house a new jail, spoke about her mentally ill younger brother\u2019s experience being locked up on Rikers Island. She described the struggle she and her single mother, who did not have a car, faced in reaching the facility.\n\n\u201cWhile he was there, he was there alone,\u201d she said before the vote. \u201cWe abandoned him as a community, we abandoned him as a city and we abandoned him as a family, and we have to live with the consequences.\u201d\n\nBarry Grodenchik, a Queens Democrat, talked about his brother, a former drug addict who was sent to a treatment facility instead of jail. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he would have survived jail and I know that what we\u2019re doing today is a much more humane approach to criminal justice in this city,\u201d he said.\n\nDonovan Richards, who is running for Queens borough president, discussed the incarceration of the five black and Latino men wrongly convicted of raping a white woman in Central Park in 1989.\n\n\u201cDon't shed no crocodile tears for them and vote against this plan,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of his opponents, Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer, opposed the plan, saying the city should not spend money on new jails, but rather focus more on decarceration.\n\n\u201cThe criminalization and brutalization of people of color led to mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex that we seek to end here today,\u201d he said. \u201cVoting to invest $10 billion right back into that system is something I cannot do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they build it, they will fill it!\u201d a crowd of like-minded opponents chanted as they left City Hall Thursday.\n\nOthers warned the plan will not keep the city safe if crime increases.\n\n\u201cThe plan does not take into consideration the risk that these jails will present in the event of emergency, nor does it consider the possibility of future spikes in crime, which I have seen in past decades,\u201d Council Member Robert Holden said Thursday.\n\nBefore closing Rikers, a new jail would be built in every borough except Staten Island \u2014 an exemption that did not earn de Blasio the support of the borough\u2019s two Republican members.\n\nIn Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, the proposed facilities would replace existing jails, while the Bronx jail would be built anew. The Vernon C. Bain Center off the shore of Hunts Point, known as the barge, will also close as part of the plan. The Manhattan and Brooklyn jails will rise to 295 feet, and the Bronx and Queens ones will stand at 195 feet.\n\nThe Council Members whose districts will house the new jails \u2014 Ayala, Levin, Margaret Chin and Karen Koslowitz \u2014 voted in favor of the plan.\n\n\u201cThis has been the hardest issue I have ever worked on \u2014 the hardest,\u201d Koslowitz said Wednesday. \u201cThere are people in my community that I\u2019ve worked very hard for, for many years, that are angry with me because I am voting yes. But I feel that I\u2019m doing the right thing, the most humane thing that I can possibly do.\u201d\n\nThe close vote was unusual for the 51-member legislative body, whose 48 Democrats often vote in unison.\n\nIt was the culmination of an effort that began with Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Melissa Mark-Viverito, who first proposed it in 2016. At the time it was criticized as too complex and expensive an undertaking to pull off. Even de Blasio was skeptical of the idea, but he embraced it the following year as support grew.\n\nEarlier this week he called it an opportunity to create \u201ca much, much smaller jail system, built to be humane to everyone involved.\u201d\n\nWhile consensus has developed in recent years around closing Rikers, the city\u2019s proposal was bogged down by political conflict.\n\nThe administration had to relocate the planned Manhattan jail to adhere to opposition from Chinatown residents protesting the original site. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz and other Bronx politicians have opposed the siting of the Bronx jail. Council Member Rafael Salamanca, who said he supports the closure of Rikers, voted down the plan on Thursday because the city would not change the location in his borough.\n\nThe administration has tweaked the plan in recent weeks to assuage critics, slashing the heights of the proposed jails and committing $391 million in neighborhood and anti-incarceration investments.\n\n\"Today we made history. This era of mass incarceration is over,\" de Blasio said during a press conference following the Council vote. \"We believe in redemption and today\u2019s vote is a vote for redemption.\u201d", "description": "Closing the facilities promises to add an important chapter to de Blasio\u2019s legacy.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg", "Janaki Chadha"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/18/35/0e2a02d04807a16d7fea70ba3899/rikers-ap-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
