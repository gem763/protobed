There was a little bit of wind but it was OK.\n\n\u201cPeople were cheering all along the course, which gave me more energy.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Cherono sprints to win \u2013\n\nKenya\u2019s Lawrence Cherono won a men\u2019s race that came down to the wire in 2:05:45 \u2014 barely edging Ethiopia\u2019s Dejene Debela who was second in 2:05:46 with another Ethiopian, Asefa Mengstu, third in 2:05:48.\n\nLast year\u2019s winner Mo Farah of Britain was never a factor \u2014 finishing a distant eighth in 2:09:58.\n\nFarah was among an early lead group that began to disintegrate around the 10km mark, leaving half a dozen runners, including Cherono, setting the pace.\n\nKenya\u2019s Bedan Karoki challenged late but faded before the last turn toward the finish to leave Cherono, Debela and Mengstu to sprint for the line.\n\nKaroki settled for fourth in 2:05:53.\n\nIt was a disappointing end for Farah to a week that began amid a hail of questions about the scandal surrounding his former coach Alberto Salazar.\n\nUS distance running guru Salazar has been banned for four years by the United States Anti-Doping Agency for a string of doping violations.\n\nSalazar has denied wrongdoing, but Nike shut down its Oregon Project running group headed by Salazar, and four-time Olympic gold medalist Farah arrived in Chicago for his defence to find himself again denying any irregularities during his time with the coach.", "description": "Chicago (AFP) \u2013 Kenya\u2019s Brigid Kosgei shattered Paula Radcliffe\u2019s 16-year-old women\u2019s marathon world record Sunday, winning the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/ce3129_kenya-brigid-kosgei-smiles-winning-women-2019-chicago-marathon-world-record-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
