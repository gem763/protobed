I went to see him and we took him. It was a little bit of a gamble. I remember him arriving with his mum holding her hand!\n\n\"To be fair to him, we had a couple of injuries and I threw him in. He went in at left-back and had an unbelievable debut against QPR. He hasn't looked back, has he? He's been quite remarkable.\"\n\nBut if Bruce succeeded in landing Robertson, he was less successful when he attempted to buy Van Dijk.\n\nHe said: \"I had dinner with Kenny Dalglish and the owner of Celtic, Dermot Desmond, in Barbados - I'm name-dropping now - and the owner of Celtic was waxing lyrical about the best players he's had.\n\n\"He was saying, '[Henrik] Larsson is definitely, definitely the best player that I've seen play for Celtic in my ownership', and what he said is, 'What I can't understand is, nobody has gone for Van Dijk'.\n\n\"I thought, 'That's interesting, he's seen a lot of football over the last 12 years', so I went and we tried. I tried to get him before he went to Southampton.\"\n\nAsked what the price was for the man who later arrived at Liverpool in a \u00a375million deal, he answered: \"About \u00a310million, \u00a312million. I was nowhere near getting him. I tried, but I had no chance.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bruce revealed how he still gets excited when he visits the homes of English football's big boys after taking his wife to watch games in London when he played at Gillingham.\n\nHe said with a smile: \"How she's still with me after 36 years... Night out, it was, 'Come on, we'll go and watch Arsenal and have a kebab on the way home'.\"", "description": "Liverpool look to continue their unbeaten Premier League start at Anfield, with Newcastle the visitors this weekend.
