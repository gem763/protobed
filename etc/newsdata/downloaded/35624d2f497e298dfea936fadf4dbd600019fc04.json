It's 100% time.\n\n\"Everybody should be doing this. It's about teaching them this is love, too. It's the year 2019.\n\n\"When there's ratings and money involved they do err on the side of caution. People are scared. We have to teach them slowly.\n\n(Image: S Meddle/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: TV3 Publicity <tv3publicity@gmail.com>)\n\n\"Besides, Strictly is already very gay - just look at it, all the tight trousers and glitter. There's all these guys that step out in rhinestone outfits.\"\n\nDancing on Ice's next series is set to feature Steps singer Ian \"H\" Watkins donning his skates alongside American pro Matt Evers.\n\nMichelle, though, insists Strictly fans shouldn't think the show's \"missed a trick.\"\n\nShe asked: \"How do you know they've missed a trick? The series has just begun, you don't know what's to come.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Don't count Strictly out and give all the credit to Dancing on Ice.\"\n\nThe RuPaul judge also dished on her past, specifically her wild days and how she's left the partying and booze in the dust.\n\nWhen she woke to find herself in an orgy with complete strangers, she wanted to make a change.\n\n\"That's when I stopped drinking,\" said Michelle, \"I think the last drink I ever had was when I was 21, because alcohol caused so much trouble for me.\n\n\"My wild days were pretty wild - and that's still within me. I love my past because it brought me to where I am now.\n\n\"But people change. We age, we become parents and partners. When my husband and I were first engaged we made a sex rape, which is something couples do sometimes.\n\n\"My husband decided to keep it, even though I asked him to burn it about 20 times, and it is buried. No one will find it.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nShe added that she wouldn't do anything of the sort these days.\n\nAlways candid about living with Hashimoto's Disease, which she was diagnosed with aged 29, Michelle's symptoms first started to show at 21, when she got her breast implants.\n\nIt's an autoimmune condition that attacks the thyroid gland, causing fatigue and hair loss among other symptoms.\n\nShe's since had the implants removed, and hasn't looked back.\n\nShe revealed; \"I was in the music industry and and had producers telling me I had a great body but I wasn't sexy because I didn't have breasts.\n\n\"Having the implants removed has actually given me more confidence. Now I never wear a bra, I wear tops that show how flat I am.\n\n\"I am so proud to be flat and sassy. And I've never not felt sexy.\"", "description": "Michelle dished about her past and insisted that it's past time dancing shows introduce same sex partners", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "S Meddle Itv Rex", "Publicity", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564703.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Good-Morning-Britain-TV-show-London-UK-03-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
