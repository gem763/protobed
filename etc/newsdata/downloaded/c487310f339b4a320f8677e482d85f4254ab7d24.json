He ran the clock down and then began his drive, but went down after spinning near the foul line. He retained his dribble, got up and shot, but his jumper missed. He then fell back onto the court, hands on his head.\n\nAfter signing with the Nets during the summer, Irving broke Kiki Vandeweghe\u2019s record for most points by a player in his first game with a team. Vandeweghe scored 47 for Portland at Kansas City on Oct. 27, 1984.\n\nIrving finished with eight rebounds and seven assists. Caris LeVert added 20 points.\n\nIrving signed along with Kevin Durant in July, wanting to come back home after growing up in New Jersey. He had to pause during his remarks to the crowd before the game but had no trouble keeping his composure \u2013 but ultimately not his footing \u2013 once it started, making seven 3-pointers as the Nets tried desperately to win a season opener for the first time in seven years.\n\nBut Brooklyn didn\u2019t have many answers for Towns, who also made seven threes. Then in OT it was Wiggins, who shot only 10 for 27 but made two straight baskets after the Nets took a 124-123 lead.\n\nIrving sandwiched two three-pointers around three free throws in just over a minute late in regulation, and with the game tied found a cutting Jarrett Allen in the lane. Allen was fouled but missed both free throws with 5.7 seconds remaining, and the game went to overtime when Wiggins missed a long jumper at the buzzer.\n\n\u201cThis is a special group where very rarely this happens in the NBA,\u201d Towns said. \u201cEveryone in this locker room is here for one goal. That\u2019s to win.\u201d\n\nEarly on it was all Minnesota as it started its first full season under coach Ryan Saunders. The Wolves led 20-19 in the first quarter before breaking it open with an 18-3 run that lasted into the second and expanded their lead to 38-22. It would increase to 46-28 and Minnesota took a 68-56 advantage into halftime.\n\nBut the Nets outscored the Wolves 37-20 in the third and it was close from there.\n\n\u201cIt was eventful,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of lost for words.\u201d", "description": "Irving scored 50 points but lost his balance and missed a potential winning shot that allowed the Minnesota Timberwolves to pull out a 127-126 victory", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5259eaf33b741d61e96b60a6cc709ed42c1377aa/0_0_3839_2304/master/3839.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7d9e38d392a8423ecf05369b53f9e76f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
