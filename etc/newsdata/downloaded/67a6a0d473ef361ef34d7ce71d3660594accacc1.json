Dillon says the product line will feature 57 overall items, including the \u201cmost iconic\u201d ones for Kardashian West including a contour and highlight kit, lipstick and various eyeshadow palettes. Two new exclusive cosmetic kits under the brand are expected for the holidays.\n\n\u201cKim is one of the strongest forces in pop culture and we are very excited to extend our partnership with her,\u201d Dillon said.\n\nFor Ulta\u2019s sake, Kardashian\u2019s entire Instagram following better show up to the store the first week of the makeup line\u2019s debut.\n\nKim Kardashian West attends KKW Beauty at ULTA Beauty at Courtyard at the Commons on December 6, 2018 in Calabasas, California.

With recent product launches failing to drive excitement among customers, Dillon has seen a slowdown in cosmetics purchases start to take hold.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the tide will turn. But cosmetics represent about 50% of Ulta\u2019s business, so any downturn is unwelcome news.\n\nCosmetics business is decelerating\n\n\u201cIt's clear that cosmetics and the overall U.S. market is challenged. After several years of very strong performance, growth in the makeup category has been decelerating over the last two years, but recently turned negative,\u201d Dillon explained. Ulta estimates that cosmetics sales have dropped by a mid-single digit percentage in the first half of 2019 \u2014 volatility has stretched into the third quarter.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the main issue driving this softer cycle in cosmetics is that the newness and innovation that have been the focus of most brands this year has just not driven the kind of incremental growth we've enjoyed for some period of time,\u201d said Dillon.\n\n\u201cOver the past several years, we've seen strong growth in cosmetics driven by new rituals and application techniques, like contouring and brow styling, and innovative new product formats like liquid lip, palettes and minis,\u201d she added. \u201cThis innovation resulted in new makeup routines requiring new products which drove strong incremental growth. The most recent cycle of innovation has just not driven those behaviors resulting in a soft cycle for the cosmetics category in the U.S. as innovation and newness price the market has not driven the expected growth.\u201d\n\nResults shocked Wall Street\n\nThe pressure was seen throughout Ulta\u2019s earnings day press release.\n\nSame-store sales rose 6.2%, cooling from 8.1% gain delivered in the year ago quarter. Ulta now sees full-year same-store sales growth of 4% to 6%, compared to 6% to 7% previously.\n\nFull-year earnings are projected to be $11.86 to $12.06 a share. Ulta had forecast $12.83 to $13.03 a share.\n\nUlta\u2019s overall report generally shocked Wall Street, which tripped over themselves Friday to issue downgrades on what had been a growth stock.\n\n\u201cFor a company that has been one of the most consistent models across our universe over the past five-plus years, today\u2019s results were about as shocking as one could imagine,\u201d wrote Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow. The analyst slashed his rating to Market perform from Outperform and price target to $235 from $350.\n\n\u201cWith their top-line pressured from a challenging landscape, we fear that Ulta\u2019s margin structure may not be equipped to cope with more moderate comps, and could see meaningful deleverage if top-line doesn\u2019t improve (which we believe will be challenging given industry pressures),\u201d Boruchow added.", "description": "After a lackluster second quarter, Ulta Beauty is counting on some celebrity power to give it a much-needed boost.", "authors": ["Brian Sozzi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yttYmMiE3q4JOnMJ71VmsQ--~B/aD0yNDQyO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/571c1370-cb2f-11e9-b66f-35bfe69e17fc", "published_at": "2019-08-30"}
