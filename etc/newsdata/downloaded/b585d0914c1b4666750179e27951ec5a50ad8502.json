Stephanie later discovered her hair was snapping at the ends as she brushed it. Stephanie says she was warned many times that her hair would eventually fall out from over exposure to harsh chemicals, but she never listened. It\u2019s safe to say she probably won\u2019t be dying her hair at home for a long time.

Sadly, she did not return and then proceeded to ignore our calls.\u201d\n\nThe salon then went onto point out how much the heartless act has impacted on the business with the woman dodging to pay for the full-head tint and foils worth \u00a370 ($AUD130).\n\n\"Our stylists are self-employed and when someone receives a service from them they deserve to be paid for it. Incidents like this have a big impact on small independent businesses like ours.\u201d\n\n\"Maybe there was an emergency for her leaving and if so we are sure we will understand.\" Source: Facebook\n\n\"This is beyond shocking, I had to read it twice\"\n\nHowever, they are trying to see that there may be a reasonable explanation for the woman\u2019s mysterious disappearance.\n\n\"We have decided to share this story in the hope that she may read this and decide to contact us to explain her actions. Maybe there was an emergency or some other reason for her leaving and if so we are sure we will understand.\"\n\nNaturally, other clients were shell-shocked that someone could do such a callous thing.\n\nCommenting on the warning, one woman wrote: \"I hope this lady now does the decent thing and pays up.\"\n\n\u201cI can't believe it. If she can't afford she should have just been honest,\" another said.\n\n\"This is beyond shocking, I had to read it twice as couldn\u2019t comprehend why she would do this,\" A third added.\n\nThe appalling incident led the salon calling the police who are now warning other hairdressers in the area to watch out for similar shifty behaviour.", "description": "\"Today, we have had a first in our four years as a hair salon.\"", "authors": ["Leesa Smith"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9068dd9a834df4a4b2c94787dae8b655", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
