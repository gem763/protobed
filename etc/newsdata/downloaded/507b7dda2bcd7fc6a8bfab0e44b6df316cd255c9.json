An offer was also received for its Nordic business, \u201cwhich was followed by a fully financed offer at a later stage\u201d.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve worked for Thomas Cook for 31 years\u2019: staff voice shock at collapse Read more\n\nFankhauser added: \u201cFollowing careful consideration by the board and in consultation with the lenders, the board decided not to pursue any of the bids.\n\n\u201cNone of the bids were likely to realise sufficient value and following the disposal of any individual business division, the capital structure of the remaining group was unlikely to be sustainable. It would therefore not have been commercially justifiable.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook was also approached at the start of August by the Turkish operator Anex Tour Group, which had built up an 8% stake. However, talks between Annex and Fosun failed to lead to a deal.\n\nThe witness statement laid bare the parlous state of Thomas Cook\u2019s finances, with cash outflows that included \u00a3388m due to hotel partners and \u00a3272m to other external suppliers.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nAs the situation worsened at the company, payment service providers including American Express, UniCredit and Barclaycard moved to protect themselves from potential losses in the case of a collapse.\n\nFankhauser said: \u201c[They] took steps to mitigate their financial exposure to the group, such as by withholding cash collections and cancelling the payment services which they provide to the group.\n\n\u201cThese actions further demonstrated that the company\u2019s stakeholders were beginning to take steps that negatively impacted the company\u2019s liquidity and financial position.\u201d", "description": "Chief executive tells high court company also rejected seven offers for parts of its business", "authors": ["Mark Sweney"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f61be90031ea7931361ac80b0f4e1480e612c47/0_416_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f5199a5ae6113f369b8d6f56eeffe1bb", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
