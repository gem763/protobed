I have to resolve this situation,' Bielsa said.\n\n'This process lasts nine months and we have 46 matches.\n\n'We are only 25 per cent into the competition and we have time for both of them to shine. If this doesn't happen it will be a mistake of mine. If Nketiah is not a success in Leeds I will be responsible.'\n\nThe hosts had looked to have upset the promotion favourites when Tom Barkhuizen scored\n\nHis goal sparked wild celebrations with the Preston North End substitutes in the second half\n\nMATCH FACTS Preston North End: Rudd, Fisher, Bauer, Davies, Rafferty, Pearson, Browne, Barkhuizen (Green 90+1), Johnson, Potts, Nugent (Maguire 72) Subs not used: Gallagher, Hughes, Ledson, Stockley, Ripley Booked: Fisher Goals: Barkhuizen (74) Leeds: Casilla, Ayling, White, Berardi (Roberts 77), Alioski, Phillips, Helder Costa, Dallas, Klich, Harrison, Bamford (Nketiah 77) Subs not used: Douglas, Miazek, Gotts, Davis, Clarke Goals: Nketiah (87) Referee: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire)\n\nBamford's brace accounted for Preston's most recent defeat at Deepdale in April and had his finishing replicated the quality of that appearance here rather than of the past two months, Leeds would have put a dent in the best home record in the Championship.\n\nHowever, the 26-year-old, took his barren run to eight matches, failing to hit the target when presented with a hat-trick of chances inside the opening half hour: twice heading over corners from Kalvin Phillips either side of thrashing wide when Stuart Dallas' disguised pass feathered the ball into his path.\n\nThe most clear-cut chance of his night, however, was the one dished up to him midway through the second period when Helder Costa surged to the byline and cut back only for the \u00a37million signing from Middlesbrough to make a complete hash of his shot with the goal at his mercy.\n\nThe 5,500 Leeds fans let out a collective gasp as Bamford lay prostrate on the turf.\n\nDisbelief then turned to horror six minutes later when Preston delivered the sucker punch on a rapid counter-attack - substitute Sean Maguire dashed down the right flank and Barkhuizen bundled in the finish at the far post.\n\nBut Nketiah's late opportunism - despite the best efforts of the home defence to prevent a looping effort crossing the line - salvaged a draw.\n\n'We didn't defend a set play well enough and that's taken two points off us,' sighed Preston manager Alex Neil.\n\nIt was a frustrating evening for Patrick Bamford (middle) and Leeds before the late equaliser", "description": "RICHARD GIBSON AT DEEPDALE: Nketiah, the Arsenal loanee frustrated by the lack of a Championship start during his temporary move, nodded in four minutes from time to grab a point.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/23/20057828-0-image-a-14_1571781834180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
