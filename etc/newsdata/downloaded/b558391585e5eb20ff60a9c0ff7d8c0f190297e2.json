Although North Korea is a nuclear state with nuclear arms, a far more dangerous scenario is the collapse of the regime in Pyongyang and the political vacuum that would create. Competing interests could draw two of the most powerful countries on Earth, the United States and China, into direct military conflict.\n\nNorth Korea lies at the intersection of two strategic fault lines. The first is its proximity to China, and China\u2019s desire to keep a friendly\u2014if unwholesome\u2014regime in place to safeguard its borders. China\u2019s borders are probably the most secure than they\u2019ve been in a thousand years, no mean feat for a country stretching from Central Asia to the Yalu River, and China would like to keep it that way. Instability along the 880-mile-long Sino\u2013North Korean border would be an unwanted distraction, even more so than the dilemma of the nuclear-armed dictatorship.\n\nThe second fault line is the regime itself and its interaction with the United States. Pyongyang has repeatedly threatened to unify the Korean peninsula by force, resulting in a strategic alliance between the United States and South Korea. To counter the overwhelming might of the Pentagon, North Korea has developed nuclear weapons and is making rapid progress to delivery vehicles, from land-based long-range missiles to missile submarines.\n\nNorth Korea has one-quarter the GDP of Ethiopia. Even in the best of times it struggles to feed all of its people. The government is brutal and alienating to the lowest tiers of society. Neighboring a rich South Korea and increasingly prosperous China, North Korean citizens are increasingly aware of the disparity in their standard of living versus their neighbors. This is not a new situation, and a collapse of the Pyongyang regime\u2014or a revolt against it\u2014has been prophesied many times over the past three decades. While it\u2019s smart not to bet on a collapse any time soon, no government lasts forever, and this particular one has severe structural weaknesses.\n\nIf and when the North Korean government does collapse, some form of military intervention is inevitable. None of the regional powers will rest until all of Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons are accounted for, and nobody really knows what that number is. Armed remnants of the old government may try to seize control of nuclear weapons to gain concessions from the international community. Instability could cause millions of the the country\u2019s 25.1 million people to hit the road, fleeing north into China and south into South Korea. None of North Korea\u2019s neighbors want that. The absence of a central government, an overabundance of weapons and a lack of food would make for an explosive combination. Military intervention into the border areas, to control refugees and disseminate aid, is one possibility, as is a deeper intervention to seize nuclear weapons and conduct countrywide security and support operations.\n\nChinese military intervention in a North Korean collapse scenario is practically a certainty. At the same time, China has repeatedly stated that U.S. military forces entering North Korea would be intolerable, and yet U.S. forces regularly train to do just that. The reality is that South Korea, as capable as it is, may not have a military large enough to handle all contingencies. In such cases the power-projection capability of the U.S. military would be essential. China famously intervened in the fall of 1950 as U.S. and South Korean forces crossed the Yalu River. In the event of a North Korean collapse, barring any agreement between the two countries ahead of time, a military confrontation between the United States and China appears likely.\n\nWhat would such a conflict look like? The United States would be pushing forces into East Asia, while the Chinese would be working hard to keep them out. Such a scenario plays to the strengths both sides have been steadily developing over the past decade, a forced-entry capability for the U.S. military and an antiaccess/area-denial capability for the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nOn the the Chinese side, the People\u2019s Liberation Army would try to shut the door on East Asia while Chinese forces advance on the ground into North Korea. Antiship ballistic missiles such as the DF-21D would attempt to keep American carrier battle groups one thousand miles or farther away from the mainland\u2014enough to restrict American naval aviation to missions involving aerial refueling. Medium-range missiles such as the DF-26 \u201cGuam Express\u201d would strike American air and naval facilities on the island of Guam, striking Andersen Air Force Base and U.S. Navy facilities.", "description": "The risk of World War III is real.", "authors": ["Kyle Mizokami"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hGhW1qq71xCcMZ35U9b7sQ--~B/aD03NDI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/d2dad5d3cf0255727210b677ea39424a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
