Keep crushing it, SNL. Truly innovative stuff from Michael Che. \u2014 lick your local leftist's throbbing wang (@jmartinwrites) October 27, 2019\n\nMichael Che about to try out the transphobic joke he was working on all week pic.twitter.com/IffXdKyMRN \u2014 Will Long\u2728 (@Willful_long) October 27, 2019\n\nHi @nbcsnl, please note that deadnaming and intentional misgendering is a form of transphobic violence. I'm so done with transphobic humor on #SNL ==> Michael Che Deadnames Caitlyn Jenner, Calls Her \u201cFella,\u201d on \u201cSNL\u201d https://t.co/4dxavYDALF via @NewNowNext \u2014 Danielle Solzman (@DanielleSATM) October 28, 2019\n\nIt's too bad that the best episode of SNL in recent memory had to be marred by Michael Che's shitty Caitlyn Jenner joke. Come on, man, it's 2019. Be better than this. \u2014 Petra (@ThePetraCorner) October 28, 2019\n\nJust heard about Michael Che deadnaming Caitlyn Jenner last night on SNL. Transphobia is not funny and not acceptable in 2019. Do better, SNL. \u2014 Tricia Cave (@tdcave) October 28, 2019\n\nTrans women are women #SNL, even Caitlyn Jenner. \u2014 Nina Wurz (@NinaWurz) October 27, 2019\n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that @nbcsnl needs to be reminded that trans people should not be a punchline. Really really disappointed that the writers relied on such a hateful and lazy joke. \u2014 Elizabeth (@ElizabethAJRM) October 28, 2019\n\n#SNL with a dumb set of Trans jokes culminating in a Caitlynn Jenner joke that had the audience audibly going \"Oh no\u2026\".\n\nAgain: Comedy that punches down ain't funny and never will be. \u2014 Kevin D. Gr\u00fcssing (Pronounced Grew-Sing) (@KevDGrussing) October 27, 2019\n\nChe did respond to at least one critic. On Monday he struck back at an Instagram critic who said that Che was \u201cafraid\u201d of trans people. In reply, Che said, \u201chow would you know what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d according to The Wrap.\n\nChe has sparked criticism before. The SNL comedian was hammered for defending Louis C.K. after the admitted sex harassing comedian attempted a comedy comeback. Che was also accused of dismissing catcalling and street harassment of women. And he took guff for calling Boston the most racist city he had ever seen.\n\nChe is not the only SNL comedian accused of \u201ctransphobia.\u201d Che\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d partner, Colin Jost, also came under fire for a \u201ctransphobic\u201d joke for saying that Democrats lost the 2016 election because they think there are \u201c37 different gender identity options.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\"\u00a0star\u00a0Michael Che is under fire for a \"transphobic\" joke about Caitlyn Jenner delivered during the \"Weekend Update\" faux news segment.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/michaelchejenner1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
