U.S. carriers have been spared by the \"natural hedge\" of dollar revenue, he added.\n\nThe run of bankruptcies has also created opportunities for stronger carriers to pick up planes, traffic and airport slots abandoned by collapsed rivals.\n\nOther airlines that have folded in 2019 include France's Aigle Azur and XL Airways, Germania, Flybmi and Adria of Slovenia, which filed for bankruptcy this week.\n\nIndian low-cost carrier SpiceJet said on Friday it may take more Boeing 737 MAX planes ordered by Jet Airways, which went bust in June.\n\nThe entire global MAX fleet numbering hundreds of the new jet remains grounded awaiting approval of software changes to address safety concerns after two fatal crashes. That has increased the jostling for substitutes, driving up waiting times and prices for new, second-hand and leased airliners.\n\nLeading European low-cost operator Ryanair, which has been hit hard by the MAX grounding, is seeking to take over Airbus A320-family aircraft previously leased by Thomas Cook and deploy them at its Austrian carrier Lauda.\n\n\"Opportunities crop up out of things like the failure of Thomas Cook,\" Ryanair group CEO Michael O'Leary said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in London on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're talking to a number of the leasing companies about taking some of those Airbus aircraft and putting them into Lauda next summer,\" he said.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Airline bankruptcies have increased this year at the fastest ever rate, led by the collapse of India's Jet Airways, British travel group Thomas Cook and Avianca of Brazil, according to industry data. \"2019 has seen the fastest growth in airline failure in history,\" said airline consulting firm IBA, which has\u2026", "authors": ["Jj Jetplane"], "top_image": "https://japantoday.com/images/japan-today-social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
