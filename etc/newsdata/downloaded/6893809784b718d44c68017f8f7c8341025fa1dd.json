Both of those animals died.\n\nThe humpback whale found at Greenhithe on Tuesday was the fifth of its species to be recorded stranded on the UK coast so far this year, compared with an annual average of one to two.\n\nDeaville said it was hard to generalize about stranding numbers because different species faced different threats, and strandings could occur for a wide variety of reasons.\n\nGlobally, humpback whale populations are increasing in size after a moratorium on commercial whaling was put into effect in 1986. More strandings are occurring as the population increases, but there are also cases of mortality related to human activities such as shipping and fishing.", "description": "A 10 meter (33-ft) humpback whale spotted in the River Thames earlier this week has been found dead just east of London and will now be handed over to scientists for an autopsy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
