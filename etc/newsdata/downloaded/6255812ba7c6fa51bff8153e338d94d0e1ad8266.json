REUTERS/Michael Dalder/Files\n\nSpot gold was down 0.6% at $1,490.10 per ounce, as of 0650 GMT, after hitting its lowest since Aug. 13 at $1,486 earlier in the session.\n\nBullion prices have shed nearly 5% since hitting a more than 6-year peak of $1,557 on Sept. 4.\n\nU.S. gold futures fell 0.8% to $1,498.50 per ounce.\n\nData released earlier in the day showed China\u2019s August consumer price index (CPI) rose above expectations, while the producer price index (PPI), a key barometer of corporate profitability, contracted less than expected, urging Beijing to step up economic stimulus as its dispute with the United States intensifies.\n\n\u201cGlobally we are seeing a shift back towards growth assets and that\u2019s coming at the cost of the safe-havens,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\n\u201cA lot has already been factored in about the effect of the trade war on China. Better-than-expected numbers might suggest that the impact might not be as deep as many thought.\u201d\n\nThe trade war between China and the United States has upset markets globally since it began more than a year ago, fanning concerns of a global economic slowdown.\n\nHowever, markets took heart from their decision to hold talks in early October in Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he did not see the threat of a recession as President Donald Trump seeks to revive trade negotiations, adding that he expected a positive year ahead for the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cIf prices hold at $1,490, we might see gold steadying. However, gold\u2019s short-term trend is downward. If it breaks through $1,480, it could fall to $1,425,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nInvestors now await the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting on Thursday for clues on monetary policy easing. The ECB is all but certain to introduce a package of monetary easing and stimulus measures, but markets doubt it will opt for a massive quantitative easing.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also widely expected to cut interest rates next week.\n\n\u201cA resumption in U.S.-China trade talks along with accommodative monetary policy by global central banks has renewed risk appetite for the current term,\u201d Phillip Futures said in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world\u2019s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.82% to 882.42 tonnes on Monday.\n\nAmong other precious metals, platinum dropped 1.2% to $935.20 per ounce, while palladium slipped to $1,542.34. Silver fell 0.2% to $17.92 per ounce.", "description": "Gold prices dropped for a fourth straight session on Tuesday as risk appetite remained buoyed by hopes for global stimulus and expectations of a possible thawing in the Sino-U.S. trade war.", "authors": ["Karthika Suresh Namboothiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428229788&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890AL", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
