hard to say just how fast it is, but I've got faith in the engineers and the scientists.\n\n\"It's going to be exciting when we roll it out.\"\n\nClancy, not in the squad for Minsk, will get his first chance to do that at the second round of the World Cup in Glasgow from November 8-10.\n\nUnder new UCI rules, all teams competing in Japan next summer must use the same kit they will race at the Olympics from the start of the World Cup onwards, with no changes allowed to prevent the theft of ideas.\n\nAll eyes will therefore be on the bikes unveiled in Minsk this weekend, but British Cycling is confident they have a winner.\n\n\"The feedback from riders and coaches in testing so far has been positive, and we are looking forward to the Minsk and Glasgow rounds of the UCI Track Cycling World Cup series as opportunities to further evaluate and refine the bike,\" said performance director Stephen Park.\n\n\"The HB.T forms just one part of the world-class support we are able to offer our riders across all of the Olympic and Paralympic cycling disciplines as our focus narrows on Tokyo 2020.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Three-time Olympic champion Ed Clancy is confident Great Britain
