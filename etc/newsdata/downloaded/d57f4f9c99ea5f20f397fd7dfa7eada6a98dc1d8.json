Hopes appear to be dimming that the world's two largest economies will reach a near-term resolution to their long-running trade war, which has shaken markets for months and strained world economies.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said bilateral trade talks with China were going well, but warned he would be \"tougher\" if negotiations extend beyond the 2020 U.S. presidential election and he is re-elected. manufacturing output shrank in August for the first time in 3-1/2 years, according to the Institute for Supply Management's Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), stoking fears that the global economic slowdown has reached American shores. we had economic data that's providing reinforcement to bearish economic argument, and it's the first trading day since new tariffs were put in place,\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \"People are seeing global economic slowdown coming to fruition and taking money off the table.\"\n\nBut Carlson cautioned against giving too much weight to market behavior on the first trading day following the unofficial end of summer.\n\n\"It's the first day back after August and you're getting the students back to class,\" Carlson added. \"You'll have a better read next week.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 285.26 points, or 1.08%, to 26,118.02, the S&P 500 lost 20.19 points, or 0.69%, to 2,906.27 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 88.72 points, or 1.11%, to 7,874.16.\n\nEuropean stocks backed off from 1-month highs after the disappointing U.S. PMI data fueled worries of global economic softness, while uncertainty over Britain's hard exit from the European Union put an end to the 100's four-day winning streak. pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.23% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.52%.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year yield dipping to its lowest since July 2016 after the downbeat ISM report exacerbated worries about a weakening global economy in the shadow of the U.S.-China trade war. 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 1.4708%, down from 1.506% late on Friday.\n\nThe 30-year bond last rose 7/32 in price to yield 1.9639%, down from 1.973% late on Friday.\n\nTrade and Brexit concerns drove the dollar to its highest level against a basket of major currencies since mid-May 2017, but the greenback erased its gains following the dismal ISM factory data. rose 0.1%, with the euro down 0.01% to $1.0965.\n\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.14% versus the greenback at 106.08 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2079, up 0.11% on the day.\n\nThe disappointing U.S. factory data also drove oil prices lower, as concerns over the weakening global economy undermined the demand outlook. futures settled at $53.94 per barrel, down 0.68%, while futures settled down 2.11% at $58.26 per barrel.\n\nGold prices surged more than 1%, with the safe-haven precious metal hovering within shouting distance of its more- than-six-year high of $1,554.56 per ounce. gold added 1.0% to $1,544.95 an ounce.\n\nCMCU3 lost 0.18% to $5,610.00 a tonne.\n\nThree-month aluminum on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3 rose 0.34% to $1,755.00 a tonne.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2Po7AHT\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S. Treasury yields drop, stocks slide as global slowdown fears loom", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA7D094_L.jpg"}
