Warren backs, is that it doesn\u2019t trust the American people,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway.\u201d\n\nTrying to distinguish his own plan, which he has dubbed \u201cMedicare-for-all who want it,\u201d Buttigieg suggested giving the public \u201ca version of Medicare\u201d and letting them \u201cfigure that out for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them,\u201d Buttigieg said, before turning to Sanders and Warren. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nSanders responded by saying Medicare-for-all would cover all basic needs, including home health care, and would allow patients to go to any doctor they wanted, unlike some private insurance programs.\n\n\u201cSo if you want comprehensive health care, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs \u2026 moving to Medicare-for-all is the way to go,\u201d Sanders said.", "description": "Amid a heated debate about health care \u2014 pitting those in support of Medicare-for-all against those in favor of alternate options \u2014 South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg accused Sen.
