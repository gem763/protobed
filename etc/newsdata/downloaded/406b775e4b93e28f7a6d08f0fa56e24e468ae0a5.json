But, when they complained, their pleas for help were ignored.\n\nWell, as we reveal, Amazon has done little to tackle the problem. Fraud victims are still being given the runaround, with emails and calls repeatedly ignored. Even worse, the retailer now seems to be actively thwarting banks' attempts to refund customers.\n\nIn the cases of Darren Brown and Andrew MacTaggart, Amazon tried to claw back the money refunded by their banks. Meanwhile, Mark Chatfield can't get a refund after being locked out of his account and the retailer refuses to tell him what was ordered.\n\nYou tell us this stonewalling tactic is one of your biggest frustrations. And we sympathise.\n\nEven when our reporter tried to intervene on your behalf, the firm still refused to tell us anything. Amazon blames this type of fraud on phishing emails, which trick customers into handing over their account information. And because we store our card details on the site, it means once the crooks are in, they can just start spending.\n\nIt is hoped that new rules will give online shoppers more protection, as they will be required to enter a special code sent to their mobile phone before payments go through \u2014 but these won't be in force for another 18 months and, even then, they aren't foolproof.\n\nAmazon is home to some of the best tech minds in the world, so if anyone can stop the scammers, it's them. In the meantime, the least the firm can do is stop being so arrogant and start treating victims fairly.\n\nScammers' trap\n\nOn the subject of fraud, have you ever wondered how scammers seem to know when someone is expecting a call from their broadband provider?\n\nTake Money Mail reader Ernest, 86, from near Dumfries. He reported a problem with his internet speed to TalkTalk on September 9.\n\nOn September 16, someone claiming to work for Openreach called to say the issue had been passed to them to resolve.\n\nAfter a 30-minute conversation, the caller offered to pay Ernest \u00a3300 for being a loyal customer.\n\nErnest says: 'I was getting tired, so, like an old fool, I gave him my bank details. As soon as I hung up, I realised I'd done something stupid and called my bank, which was able to stop any payments.\n\n'I know I have been na\u00efve, but they knew so much about me that I let my guard down.'\n\nAre these crooks just calling so many people they are eventually bound to hit the jackpot? Or do they have someone on the inside?\n\nWrite to me if you've ever fallen victim to this type of fraud.\n\nPeople power\n\nBrilliant news that Barclays has reversed its decision to ban cash withdrawals from post offices.\n\nMoney Mail readers should give themselves an enormous pat on the back, as it is in no small part due to your passionate protests.\n\nI have it on good authority the bank's offices were inundated with your letters, urging chief executive Jes Staley to reconsider.\n\nThis is the second time Barclays has been forced to U-turn on a controversial plan that would severely hinder people's access to cash.\n\nIn the early Noughties, it toyed with the idea of charging customers of other banks to make cash withdrawals from its ATMs before caving to a deluge of criticism.\n\nWe can only hope the next time Barclays tries to put profits before customers' needs, it thinks again.", "description": "Scouring my inbox, I can see an alarming number of delivery notifications for books and films from Amazon - but not a single fraud alert.
