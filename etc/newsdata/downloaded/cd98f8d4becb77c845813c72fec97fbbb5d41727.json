Experts blame a lack of cash and a shortage of staff for the worrying trend, saying NHS workers are unable to devote the time necessary to safely train new pump users.\n\n\u2018Injections work \u2013 they keep patients alive,\u2019 says Lesley Jordan, senior technology access specialist at type 1 diabetes charity JDRF.\n\n\u2018But for some people, injections cannot keep them within the target blood glucose range. These patients could benefit from a pump, but not enough people are getting them.\u2019\n\nIn patients with type 1 diabetes the immune system malfunctions and attacks the pancreas \u2013 the gland that makes insulin, a hormone that moves sugar out of the blood and into the cells that need it for energy.\n\nThis causes blood glucose levels to become too high, which, over time, raises the risk of heart disease, eye problems and kidney damage. They can also suffer confusion, fitting and even death.\n\nThese patients need man-made insulin for the rest of their lives, and those whose blood glucose levels remain high despite injections are entitled to a pump on the NHS. The devices are attached to the body and continuously deliver insulin via a thin tube placed under the skin, keeping blood sugar at the right level.\n\nIn some areas, more than 40 per cent of type 1 diabetics use pumps, compared to five per cent in other regions. Jordan says: \u2018Clinics across the country don\u2019t have enough staff to help their current patient list and training patients to use a pump is quite labour-intensive.\u2019\n\nDr Emma Wilmot, a consultant diabetologist and founder of the Diabetes Technology Network, says: \u2018Insulin pumps are life-changing. If a patient meets the criteria, they should have access to an insulin pump.\n\nFigures for England and Wales reveal shocking geographical disparities in access to insulin pumps \u2013 small portable devices that help regulate blood sugar levels without the need for injections (stock image)\n\n\u2018If they aren\u2019t getting access locally, then asking for a second opinion from another pump centre would be entirely appropriate.\u2019\n\nKaterina Petropoulou, 36, from West London, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2014 after noticing she had lost a lot of weight and had blurred vision.\n\nInitially, she managed with insulin injections. \u2018I didn\u2019t like them at all,\u2019 she says. \u2018I was injecting up to seven times a day.\u2019\n\nAfter 18 months on a waiting list, Katerina, a researcher at Imperial College, was finally given a pump.\n\nShe also got a continuous glucose monitor to provide a reading of her blood glucose levels throughout the day without having to do fingerprick tests.\n\n\u2018It changed my life,\u2019 she said. \u2018I was always thinking about my blood sugar. But when I got the pump, I felt more secure and knew exactly how much insulin was in my body. I felt I could manage my diabetes, move forward and be a normal person.\u2019", "description": "Figures for England and Wales reveal shocking geographical disparities in access to insulin pumps - small portable devices that help regulate blood sugar levels without the need for injections.", "authors": ["Sally Wardle For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/19/20222720-0-image-a-106_1572114591525.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
