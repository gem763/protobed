Motorcycles are better", "language": "en", "text": "Most electric vehicles are playthings for the wealthy. They can easily cost $50,000 or more, even with federal subsidies. And you\u2019ll basically need another car if you take road trips where charging stations aren\u2019t reliably available.\n\nBut what about a sleek electric motorcycle for $14,000? That\u2019s in the wave runner / snowmobile category, putting in the recreation budget rather than family transportation. Hey, times are good. A little splurge never hurt anybody. And Junior can wait couple of years to get braces.\n\nThat\u2019s what I thought as I was driving the Cake Kalk&, a bantamweight electric motorcycle made in Sweden. My only complaint is that gangly name. Cake is the company. The Kalk& is the motorcycle. I have no idea why there\u2019s an & at the end. Let\u2019s just say it doesn\u2019t translate from whatever the original Swedish is. That ampersand at the end is so weird I\u2019m just going to pretend it isn\u2019t there.\n\nCake Kalk& More\n\nBut forget that. The Kalk is a combo on-road/off-road bike that\u2019s brimming with ya-yas. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Pras Subramanian and I tested it on busy Manhattan streets, where gawkers shouted \u201cwhat is that?\u201d as we darted past delivery trucks and Ubers. You can see for yourself the way Swedish designers interpret industrial chic. It\u2019s not a sport bike, not a hog and not a dirt bike. It\u2019s modern art with a motor.\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG) sells an electric bike called the LiveWire, for $30,000. Love the bike. Hate the price. For less than half that, the Kalk offers less range and muscle but the same freewheeling liberation. Pickup isn\u2019t explosive, as it was on the Ninja (7012.T) I once owned (but shouldn\u2019t have), but it\u2019s quick and exhilarating. The aluminum frame feels light as a glider, making this the most nimble bike I\u2019ve ever ridden. There\u2019s no clutch and no shifting, just a throttle. I love manual transmissions in cars, but I didn\u2019t miss shifting on the Kalk.\n\nA full recharge takes about two and a half hours from a standard outlet, so you don\u2019t have to invest in a separate charging apparatus and hire an electrician. The Kalk can go about 60 miles on a charge, more if you choose the regenerative braking that helps recover energy. Top speed is limited to about 60 miles per hour, to discourage highway riding on a bike that weighs a scant 175 pounds. No matter. Take your Tesla on the highway and mount the Kalk when it\u2019s time for some fun.\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
