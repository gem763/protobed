The 2018 killing of Botham Jean, a 26-year-old black accountant, by the white police officer sparked street protests, particularly when prosecutors initially opted to bring the lesser charge of manslaughter against Guyger. \u201cThis is a huge victory, not only for the family of Botham Jean, but as his mother Allison told me a moment ago, this is a victory for black people in America. It\u2019s a signal that the tide is going to change here. Police officers are going to get held accountable for their actions, and we believe that will begin to change policing culture all over the world,\u201d said a civil rights attorney, Lee Merritt, who is representing the Jean family.
