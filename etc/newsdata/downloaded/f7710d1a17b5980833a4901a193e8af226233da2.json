On Wednesday, CNN released a digital ad showing that the network is solely focused on impeachment. On tape, Project Veritas caught CNN president Jeff Zucker saying this is all he wants to focus on, and ignore pretty much the rest of everything in the news.\n\nCary Poarch, a contract employee in Washington Bureau, became so sick with what he saw at CNN that he decided to turn to Project Veritas and go undercover. He recorded hours of top brass, including Zucker, discussing how they shape the news. The videos have confirmed what we all suspected for quite some time, but which CNN has vehemently denied. It is obvious to anybody with a brain that the \"news\" station leans to the left and despises President Trump, but it still claims to be unbiased.\n\nOne of Poarch's clips show that Zucker wants CNN to focus on impeachment all the time. He has a personal vendetta against Trump, and wants impeachment to take over the news cycle. He would never say this in public, but on weekly morning phone calls he makes sure that this is what his network is focusing on:\n\nJeff Zucker has served as president of CNN Worldwide since 2013. In recordings of daily phone calls, Zucker directed staffers to push the impeachment narrative. \u201cI want to stay with this, our top, top \u2013 our own reporters, our own political analysts, the top, the top [unintelligible] we have. Okay, so make sure we\u2019re doing that. All these moves are moves towards impeachment. So, don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t lose sight of what the biggest story is.\u201d\n\nZucker also says he doesn't care about the whole gun control issue, he wants everybody focused on impeachment.\n\n\"I don\u2019t care about the MSNBC event, OK? I don\u2019t care about them. Let\u2019s just stay very focused on impeachment,\" Zucker said of an MSNBC gun town hall. \"We shouldn\u2019t just pretend, oh, this is going one way. And so all of these moves are toward impeachment.\"\n\nWell, here's the over the top, movie trailer-like video CNN released today:\n\nThe impeachment inquiry, there\u2019s only one place for it all. https://t.co/XGceMznItW pic.twitter.com/LLaWlsPTVV \u2014 CNN (@CNN) October 16, 2019\n\nAs The Federalist's Erielle Davidson points out, \"It\u2019s almost like...CNN wants impeachment. This is one of the most bizarre ads I have seen in a while.\"\n\nIt\u2019s almost like...CNN wants impeachment.

They are caught on tape saying as much. Perhaps they will now admit their biases?\n\nEditor's Note: In the interest of transparency, the author of this piece has a relative who works for Project Veritas.", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:50:00PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/200/c2c3eb54-f7f1-40c3-84de-c9dcc1130b27.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
