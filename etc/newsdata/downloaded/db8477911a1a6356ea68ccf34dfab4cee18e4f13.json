Still, they took a clean sheet.\n\nAnd though out-of-form on both the domestic and European stages for some time, United finally ended their long wait for victory on the road, earning their first away win since beating Paris Saint-Germain in Paris some 233 days ago.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Restoring this team and this club to the elite of European football was never going to happen overnight. It was always certain involve a much longer, more difficult process with ups and downs along the way.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But is that what we should expect - and accept - from Manchester United? Has it come to the point now where a useful result excuses a mediocre performance?\n\nScratch beneath the surface of Thursday\u2019s 1-0 win in Belgrade and there is little room for encouragement. Take away Anthony Martial\u2019s decisive penalty at the end of the first half and United created very little to trouble Partizan. It is more than a familiar issue under Solskjaer but the defining characteristic of his side\u2019s difficult start to the season.\n\nThis was another game in which United dominated possession - enjoying a 60 per cent share of the ball - yet struggled for coherence and fluency up front. Martial\u2019s penalty was their only shot on target, while Partizan had enough opportunities to claim a result. That was the case despite Solskjaer retaining the 3-4-1-2 formation which earned a surprise draw against Liverpool and had some hoping that United had reached a turning point.\n\nSavo Milosevic spoke after the final whistle of having \u201cnullified\u201d United\u2019s attack. \u201cWe've not created as many as we like,\u201d Solskjaer admitted. \u201cWe've not scored as many as we'd like.\u201d He took encouragement from Martial\u2019s return all the same. \u201cAnthony's back, he\u2019s got a goal today and I'm sure you'll see us improve as a team with Anthony in the team because he does give us something different.\u201d\n\nThat may well be the case but Martial offered very little besides converting the crucial spot-kick. It was one of only 18 touches which he managed in his hour on the pitch before being substituted. Marcus Rashford, his replacement, managed four more than Martial in half the time. Solskjaer\u2019s post-match comments also suggested that Martial was responsible for the volume of Partizan attacks, with his reluctance to press from the front.\n\nIt was, in fairness, his first start since August and a hamstring injury and United\u2019s lack of creativity can not be pinned on one player. It cannot be solved by one player either. There is now a large-enough sample size - dating back to Solskjaer\u2019s caretaker spell last December - to suggest that the problem is systemic and not easily fixable. There has been much talk about \u2018taking more risks\u2019 and playing \u2018that one pass\u2019 around Old Trafford and Carrington recently, but perhaps it is time to try a more sophisticated solution.\n\nPerhaps United can just keep winning penalties, having picked up their fifth of the season already in Belgrade. Awarded after a brilliant surge by young full-back Brandon Williams, it was the 14th spot-kick of Solskjaer\u2019s time in charge and the 11th scored - more than any other Premier League side in all competitions over the same period.\n\nCredit where it is due: United may have found an edge here. Plenty of the penalties have come through sharp direct runs into the area when under pressure like Williams\u2019. Those are the type of runs that Solskjaer is encouraging his players to make on a daily basis. But despite its significant effect during the opening months of this season, it hardly feels like the most reliable or sustainable tactic.\n\nIt should not be ignored that - for all the reasons previously stated - Thursday\u2019s result was a good one. But against the fifth-best team in Serbia, 10 months into Solskjaer\u2019s project and after a long stretch of underwhelming attacking performances, should it be considered good enough?", "description": "Taken in isolation, Manchester United\u2019s win away to Partizan Belgrade is an excellent result.
