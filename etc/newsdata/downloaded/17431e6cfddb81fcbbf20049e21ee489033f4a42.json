(Boeing via Twitter)\n\nBoeing is shifting the head of its growing Global Services division to take over its troubled Commercial Services division, in hopes that his familiarity with supply chains and customers will counter a growing controversy over automated control systems on Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jets.\n\nThe company said Stan Deal, who had been president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, is replacing Kevin McAllister, who was president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\n\u201cOur entire Boeing team is focused on operational excellence, aligned with our values of safety, quality and integrity, and we\u2019re committed to delivering on our commitments and regaining trust with our regulators, customers and other stakeholders,\u201d Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s president and CEO, said today in a statement announcing the shift. \u201cStan brings extensive operational experience at Commercial Airplanes and trusted relationships with our airline customers and industry partners.\u201d\n\nDeal has headed Global Services since it was split off from Commercial Airplanes to become a separate business unit in 2016. Before that split, he was in charge of services while it was under the wing of the Commercial Airplanes unit. In all, he has more than 30 years of aerospace experience at Boeing.\n\nMcAllister was named to head Boeing Commercial Airplanes when Boeing Global Services was created.\n\nIn his statement, Muilenburg said Boeing was \u201cgrateful to Kevin for his dedicated and tireless service to Boeing, its customers and its communities during a challenging time, and for his commitment to support this transition.\u201d\n\nMcAllister, who came to Boeing from GE Aviation, said \u201cit has been an honor to serve with such a professional team for the past three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoeing is a great company with a commitment to safety I have seen firsthand working side-by-side with many thousands of tremendously talented and dedicated employees,\u201d McAllister said in today\u2019s statement.\n\nMcAllister held the top post at Boeing Commercial Airplanes over a period that stretched from the first 737 MAX delivery to the investigations spawned by two catastrophically fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018, in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nInvestigators concluded that both crashes were caused by technical problems with an automated control system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. Hundreds of 737 MAX jets were grounded worldwide, and although Boeing has worked out a software fix for the MCAS, the Federal Aviation Administration has not yet signed off on returning the jets to service.\n\nKevin McAllister, shown here during a news conference in 2017, has left his post as president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.

At the time, The New York Times quoted unnamed sources as saying that Boeing executives questioned McAllister\u2019s handling of the 737 MAX crisis and other problems related to the Commercial Airplanes unit.\n\nIn contrast, Deal has been behind many of the positive developments at Boeing Global Services, including a sharp rise in the business unit\u2019s revenue and a string of acquisitions and partnerships. Global Services\u2019 portfolio includes data analytics and airplane maintenance services, which are expected to become increasingly important selling points for Boeing\u2019s future airplanes.\n\nDeal\u2019s replacement as head of Global Services is Ted Colbert, who joined Boeing in 2009 and served as the company\u2019s chief information officer and senior vice president of information technology and data analytics. \u201cTed brings to our Global Services business an enterprise approach to customers and strong digital business expertise \u2014 a key component of our long-term growth plans,\u201d Muilenburg said.", "description": "Boeing is shifting the head of its growing Global Services division to take over its troubled Commercial Services division, in hopes that his familiarity with supply chains and customers will counter a growing controversy over automated control systems on Boeing's 737 MAX jets.
