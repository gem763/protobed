What he does right now as a football player; it is insane.\n\n'The physicality that he has still got, that drive. Imagine the impact he would have on the forwards that we have right now. They would see the obsession that this guy has got and that would be a great example.\n\n'He is more obsessed than anybody I have seen. Even van Nistelrooy was not in his league in the way that he is acting in front of goal. He wants every ball over the 90 minutes and it is a joy to see.\n\n'His dedication is unbelievable so to see him back at United would be more than a dream, because I'm sure that he would have a massive impact. Maybe less goals, but it would be amazing.'\n\nSaha won two titles as a player at Old Trafford and admitted their decline was tough to watch\n\nSaha also had admiration for the Portuguese's work in training and match preparation.\n\n'It was insane. He was always early doing his prevention work to make sure that his body was super fit. Then after the session I remember we would run a few full lengths of the pitch, and he was dribbling at full pace. When you think it is all natural, it is hard work.\n\n'People think that he could just dribble but it was hard work building that control of the ball. It is amazing because the most important element of his hard work is his belief.\n\n'He knows how good he is because he worked hard, and when you work hard you don't have any doubts. It's like working for an exam when you know that you have worked hard, you will get the result.'\n\nThe prolific Frenchman also played for Everton during the latter part of his career\n\nHaving played for both Manchester United and Everton, Saha admitted that Liverpool's current dominance was 'painful' to watch.\n\n'It is painful, but the way that they are doing it is a joy to see. If you all winning with dirty football you could say it, but I love football more than being a fan of any one team. When I see them play I'm sorry and it is painful to say, but it is a joy to watch because it is attacking football and they play with heart.\n\n'It's more than just about a region whether it's Manchester or Liverpool. It is dedication, desire, they work hard, play attacking football and they want to communicate that with the fans.\n\n'I enjoy it and I hope that Manchester United and Everton can replicate it, because that identity is there with Liverpool.\n\nI think that the only team that can beat Liverpool is Liverpool, if they don\u2019t play the way that they are playing.'", "description": "Louis Saha named Cristiano Ronaldo as the most 'obsessed' player he played with, and feels his former team-mate would revive Manchester United's fortunes.", "authors": ["James Ayles For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/18/19752248-0-image-a-18_1571161770838.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
