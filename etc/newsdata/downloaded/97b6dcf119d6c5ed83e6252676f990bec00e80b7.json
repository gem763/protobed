By comparison, the average family office portfolio in North America held about 32% of its assets in equities in 2018, according to Campden Wealth\u2019s 2018 global family office report.\n\nThe growth overseen by the billionaire\u2019s investment chief, Michael Larson, who oversees family office Cascade Investment, has enabled Gates to build the world\u2019s largest private foundation without diminishing his fortune.\n\nThat may start to shrink if politicians heed his call for higher taxes.\n\n\u201cI doubt, you know, the U.S. will do a wealth tax but I wouldn\u2019t be against it,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cThe closest thing we have to it is the estate tax. And I\u2019ve been a huge proponent that that should go back to the level of 55% that it was a few decades ago.\u201d\n\nInequality has become an explosive political issue with America\u2019s richest 0.1% controlling more wealth than at any time since 1929. On Tuesday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation released its annual Goalkeepers report. The study seeks to monitor and aid the progress of the United Nations in achieving in its Sustainable Development Goals, which the foundation says are being hindered by persistent inequality. The report called for greater investment in health care, education and technology to help reduce inequality worldwide.\n\n\u201cThere is no silver bullet that will make geography, gender and other random factors stop mattering,\u201d the report notes. \u201cBut guaranteeing that every single child has access to good health and education systems is a very good start in that direction.\u201d\n\nGates, 63, also backed higher income taxes on America\u2019s wealthiest people and made a call for greater transparency. \u201cI\u2019m for way more financial transparency. I don\u2019t like that you can have trusts where nobody knows who owns it.\u201d\n\nWhile Gates remains bullish on the U.S. and global economy, he doubted that the performance he\u2019s enjoyed over the past was likely to endure. \u201cThere\u2019s reasons to think absolute returns for the next decade will be less than they have been for the last several decades.\u201d\n\n(Adds details from report in ninth paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Tom Metcalf in London at tmetcalf7@bloomberg.net;Erik Schatzker in New York at eschatzker@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Bill Gates is still in wealth-creation mode.\u201cWe\u2019re not, you know, in some defensive posture where we\u2019re mostly in cash, or anything like that,\u201d the Microsoft Corp. founder said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cThe strategy that\u2019s been used on the investments is to be over 60%", "authors": ["Tom Metcalf", "Erik Schatzker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NT0YNGBtuaMlU2Tj8ouvpg--~B/aD0xMzM1O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/c2d8f07700d6913b826e717da404e488", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
