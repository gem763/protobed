'Before long, unless we are very, very lucky, people are going to get killed, people are going to be shot,' former British governor Chris Patten told Sky News. 'The idea that with public order policing you send police forces out with live ammunition is preposterous.' Carrie Lam, the city's Beijing-backed leader, has banned protesters from wearing masks in a bid to end the violence by militant activists. 'She would have to be crazy to be making these decisions on her own without being pressured into them. The face mask business, absolutely madness,' said Patten. 'I fear for the future, unless Carrie Lam actually intervenes and understands the importance of dialogue.'\n\nAn 18-year-old student and a 38-year-old woman were the first to be prosecuted under the ban, which came into force Saturday under sweeping emergency powers aimed at quashing violence in the protests for more democratic freedoms.\n\nAt least five anti-riot officers were filmed attacking one activist, who had already been brought to the ground, in a trending video posted on Facebook by singer Tommy Yuen, who urged the public to 'share it as soon as possible'.\n\nThe 40-second clip shows the policemen punching and kicking one man dressed in black.

'As long as there are possible ways to stamp down on the riots, the government will not rule out the possibility of placing a ban on the internet,' said Ip Kwok-him, a veteran pro-Beijing politician and member of Hong Kong's executive council. Ip said the internet has been crucial to protesters, who have no public leaders and use online forums and encrypted messaging apps to mobilise. But he said the government recognised any online shutdown could have a knock-on effect. 'I think a condition for implementing the Internet ban would be not to affect any businesses in Hong Kong,' he said.

Offenders could be jailed for up to one year by the legislation.\n\nMr Patten said Lam would have to be 'crazy' to be making these decisions on her own.\n\nHe said: 'The face mask business [is] absolutely madness which people will protest against.'\n\nHe added that the way forward would be to engage with the demonstrators, especially the peaceful ones.\n\nIp Kwok-him, a veteran pro-Beijing politician and member of Hong Kong's executive council, said controls on the internet could be introduced to combat violence - remarks that are likely to spark further fury from the public.\n\nA Filipino woman is transferred by rescue workers after she was shocked by tear gas during a demonstration in Wan Chai\n\nThe ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong have seen pro-democracy protesters clash with police since June 9 this year.
