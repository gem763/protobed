They're capable of doing anything.\n\n\"When you deal with them, you just have to obey them, and whatever they tell you, you have to do,\" Serbaz said.\n\nOne woman in the family area of the camp said she and others began to have problems breathing while hidden inside a sealed container.\n\nWhen they shouted and kicked the walls, she said, the driver simply swore at them.\n\nThey had to call the police, who tracked the GPS signal on their mobile phones to find them and get them out.\n\nA Kurdish man, Taish, also told me that he had tried to cross the Channel in refrigerated lorries. He was found each time by border guards.\n\n\"Sometimes we are happy for them to save our lives,\" he said. \"Sometimes we are sad that they didn't let us go to the UK.\"\n\nDespite the shock of 39 people dying on the crossing, Taish said he was not put off.\n\n\"We are between two deaths,\" he explained. \"If we go back to our countries, it's death; if we try to get to the UK, maybe it's death, too.\n\n\"Thirty-nine people die in a truck, but thousands die in my country. I think it's a good death, better than the death in our country,\" Taish said.\n\nSecurity is tight at the French ports of Dunkirk and Calais, but they're attractive to both migrants and people smugglers because they're so close to the UK.\n\nAnd as one man put it, \"if you're going to cross in the back of a lorry, three hours is better than seven.\"\n\nPeople smugglers here charge up to \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,640; $11,100) per person for passage to the UK.\n\nThey're also reported to be blocking access to the lorry parks for anyone who hasn't paid, making it more difficult for people to try their luck on their own.\n\nBut, today at least, there's another cost to weigh.\n\n\"There are deaths at sea,\" Serbaz told me, \"and deaths in the lorries. We honestly don't know which way to go.\"", "description": "Migrants at a French camp fear dying in UK-bound trucks, but say the Essex tragedy won't deter them.", "authors": ["Lucy Williamson", "Bbc News", "Puythouck Camp", "Northern France"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12648/production/_109363357_capture.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
