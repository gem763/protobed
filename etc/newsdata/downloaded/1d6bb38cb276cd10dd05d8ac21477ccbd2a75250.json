But the summer before my senior year in high school, my family and I flew to New Orleans instead \u2013 my dad had a surprise specifically for me.\n\nWhen he met me in our hotel lobby with my uncle Al, I thought to myself, \u201cA little father and son and uncle bonding time. I\u2019m with it.\u201d But then a luxury tour bus pulled up to the curb, and suddenly all these people piled out of the hotel and started boarding. \u201cOh, a wine tour?\u201d I thought. My dad, my uncle and I hopped on last. I saw a digital sign above the bus driver\u2019s head that read: \u201cPLANTATION TOURS.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nygel Turner. Photograph: Davey Kim\n\nThere was not a single black passenger on the bus besides the three of us. I turned to my dad and asked, \u201cAre we really going to a plantation? Like \u2013 on purpose?\u201d\n\nThe bus driver, an older black man, must have overheard what I said because he turned around and replied, \u201cI was thinking the same thing. Y\u2019all the first black people I\u2019ve ever seen on this tour \u2026\u201d\n\nTo be honest, even though I believe it\u2019s important to learn about your family\u2019s past, slavery is something I\u2019m comfortable only reading about. Although my family is from the south and always talked openly about slavery, I grew up in California where slavery wasn\u2019t something I learned much about in school. So it feels more distant, not as present, with fewer reminders \u2013 the sugar cane fields, the old mansions \u2013 all around like I\u2019d see in the south.\n\nThese reminders give me an eerie feeling when I\u2019m in Louisiana, but on the drive out to the plantation, the driver just pointed them out like monuments.\n\nEveryone was so intrigued. I even saw a young white guy with tortoiseshell glasses writing in a notebook. Was he taking notes? On what? On how to run a plantation? The bus driver quickly interrupted my thought with, \u201cWho here loves the movie \u2018Django Unchained?\u2019\u201d I raised my hand. But when I looked around, I saw no other hands and slowly lowered mine.\n\n\u201cWell to your right we have the Candyland plantation from Django.\u201d I started to hear the \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d. The person behind me commented on the \u201ctall white pillars\u201d and the \u201cbeautiful outdoor staircase\u201d that lead from the front garden to the balcony of the second floor. Everyone\u2019s phones were out.\n\nThen we got out, and the place was creepier than the bus ride. The employees at the plantation were walking around in full 1800s slave master outfits. To my left was the \u201cbig house\u201d (for the slave owners). To the right, about 100 yards away, were the slave quarters. And right in front of the slave quarters were a gift shop and a restaurant. The restaurant is known for all-you-can-eat pancakes. No joke. The overall vibe was far too festive, too tourist-y \u2013 and disrespectful.\n\nEveryone seemed to be doing more reminiscing than reflecting. My boy tortoiseshell? He was still taking notes. I couldn\u2019t help but look at the way the Spanish moss hung and swayed off the trees. I thought about the bodies that likely did the same over this ground that now is home to some tasty pancakes and souvenirs to remind you of the good ole days. I thought about my dining room back home, where we have slave bill of sale papers from my dad\u2019s side of the family in a picture frame. It\u2019s hanging right next to a picture of our family today.\n\nApparently, my dad\u2019s ancestors were held at the same plantation as Nat Turner. That\u2019s why my last name is Turner. So looking at the Spanish moss hit me in all sorts of ways because being there on that plantation, I could almost imagine slavery happening to me. It\u2019s hard to put into words. And this was all before the tour even started.\n\nThe next thing I noticed was a mint julep stand. I was surprised to see a young black woman working there (the only black employee there as far as I could tell). The idea of getting a celebratory drink seemed stupid, but at this point seeing another black person felt like home. So my dad and I walked over.\n\n\u201cBourbon or rum?\u201d she asked. Even though I\u2019m not yet allowed to make 21-and-up decisions, I replied, \u201cLet\u2019s go with the, um, uh bourbon.\u201d\n\nWhile she made the drink, through some type of black telepathy I tried my hardest to communicate how strange this place was to the employee.\n\nAs I walked away with my drink, I quickly doubled back and said, \u201cThis is weird, righhh\u2013\u201d And before I could finish my sentence, she replied, \u201cWeird as hell.\u201d\n\nWe began the tour with a guide wearing a long tan suit jacket and a white shirt with frills on it. Nervously he said, \u201cUm, I just want to say by no means are we condoning what happened. We are just showing people the history of this land.\u201d\n\nIt seemed as if the tour guide was looking at us to pardon him on behalf of all black people. So my dad, uncle and I nodded.\n\nThe big house was still in great condition. Even I caught myself marveling at the architecture for brief moments \u2013 the way the ceiling had beautifully hand-designed white borders that matched the borders on the floor that lead to the fireplace with so much detail in each corner. The strong, rich hardwood floor told stories of its own.\n\nThen my eye caught an extremely worn-down spot in the corner of the room. I asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that over there?\u201d The guide replied, \u201cOh they would usually have a slave boy stand there at every meal, pulling a rope the entire time to activate a fan over the dinner table.\u201d\n\nMy palms got really sweaty. He continued the rest of the tour, but none of it really stuck. I was so zoned out \u2013 how many slave boys stood there for hours pulling a rope to fan the room? I now wished that I didn\u2019t ask that question, that I didn\u2019t notice that spot.\n\nThen I thought, \u201cIf this is a slave plantation tour, how come there aren\u2019t any employees dressed as slaves walking around?\u201d\n\nI started to feel lightheaded. Then I found myself being dragged outside. The next thing you know, I was at the back of the \u201cbig house\u201d with my dad. Just me and him.\n\nHe said, \u201cHey, you good?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just a lot \u2026\u201d\n\nHe nodded saying, \u201cI know. It\u2019s crazy seeing how our family was treated worse than animals isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe looked at the big house. Then at me. Underneath his mowing-the-lawn sun hat, a devious smile grew on his face. He took a step toward the house \u2013 first staring at the ground where his feet sink into the dirt, then scanning the house intensely. His face was one shot of curious, two shots of scared for what these walls have seen. Then he looked back at me and said, \u201cSpit on it.\u201d\n\nWhat? Of all the things he could have said in that moment, that was the furthest from my mind.\n\n\u201cSpit?\u201d I said, unsure if he was joking or not.\n\n\u201cYes. The house. Spit on it.\u201d\n\nI swung my head to see if anyone was around. No one. Then my dad started making guttural throat sounds, put his back into it, and spat on the house. Honestly, that is one of the most disgusting things I\u2019ve seen my dad do. But as soon as he did it, it felt like the air got easier to breathe.\n\nMy dad was laughing like a little mischievous kid and said, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn \u2013 for all the people who didn\u2019t get a chance to spit before.\u201d So I got the biggest loogie my throat could muster, put my back into it and spit on the house.\n\nSuddenly, my body felt lighter and I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I knew spitting on the house was not that big of a deal. But it felt like a secret I had from the plantation. My own rebellious Nat Turner moment.\n\nMy dad leaned over and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t let that happen Nyge.\u201d\n\nI was confused. \u201cLet what happen?\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cYou know what I always say when it comes to you and your brother right? I\u2019m raising lions. You can\u2019t make anyone make you feel smaller than you are. You\u2019ll feel this more when you get older and I know you feel like I\u2019m a little bit extreme, but when situations arise later in life, I want you to be able to see it for what it is. Don\u2019t let any surroundings shrink you. Always spit on the house. Always.\u201d", "description": "Nygel Turner recounts the weird, emotional experience of touring of a former slave plantation with his dad and uncle", "authors": ["Nygel Turner", "Yr Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fa8b889076b5338212bb03abcdf415db356306a/0_44_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b63c3f6092c3c5aa245f042ea29e2106", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
