OPEC+ has cut production of crude oil this year to combat a glut in the supply and keep prices consistent.\n\nOil prices have rebounded in the last few weeks after fears of a recession coupled with a surprise excess in stockpiles in early August sent prices down into a bear market. On Friday, when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the importance of the Fed's independence in an attempt to calm global markets, oil posted its second weekly gain.\n\nIn addition, a number of remarks from high-ranking industry leaders at a meeting in Abu Dhabi this week has supported the price of oil. The United Arab Emirates energy minister said he'd push all OPEC members to commit to curbs, and a Russian official said his country expects to keep its alliance with Saudia Arabia after the new energy minister was appointed, Bloomberg reported.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz bin Salman replaced former Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih on Saturday, Bloomberg reported. He's the first member of the royal family to be energy minister \u2014 he's the half-brother of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. In addition, he's a long-time insider in the energy industry with more than three decades of experience, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe shake-up comes at a difficult time for the oil market, as crude prices have stabilized around $60, much lower than Saudi Arabia needs to balance its budget, Bloomberg reported. Increased production in the US, as well as global uncertainty stemming from the trade war has put downward pressure on oil demand and lead to questions about whether output cuts will continue into next year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Saudi Arabia appointed a new Energy Minister on Saturday, who signaled that OPEC and its allies would continue to cut outputs.\u00a0 This sent oil futures...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d768ed72e22af71c23d1208-2400/2019-09-09t153528z1lynxnpef881dsrtroptp4eneregy-wec.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
