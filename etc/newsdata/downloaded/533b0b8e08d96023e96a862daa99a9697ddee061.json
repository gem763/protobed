could be there.\n\nNell Cordukes had planned the big day in three months with the aim of ensuring that her mum Becky Best, 56, would make it after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer .\n\nBut after Becky took a turn for the worse, daughter Nell, 24, decided to bring her wedding forward.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror.co.uk, Nell from Kendal, Cumbria, said: \"It was really hard.\n\n\"We came out of the ceremony, desperately trying to hold it together.\n\n\"And we were getting hugs of congratulations but also having people tell us how sorry they are.\n\n(Image: Joe Mather Photography)\n\n(Image: Nell Cordukes)\n\n\"We had our first dance which was hard and at the end, I thought, I could stand here and cry or try and have a bit of a party.\n\n\"Which is what she wanted us to do, she wanted us to celebrate.\n\n\"You're there feeling guilty but you know that's what she wanted.\n\n\"Incredibly, it was really sunny after it had been raining for three weeks which felt like a sign from mum.\n\n\"We managed to carry on for the whole day, it was tough at times but we stuck it out.\"\n\nNell and fiance Matt planned their dream wedding in just three months after the mum-of-four was diagnosed in June.\n\nThe ceremony took place at 16th century country house Hipping Hall, in Cowan Bridge.\n\nBut Mrs Best slipped away on October 2nd just two hours after Nell had left to go to the venue.\n\n(Image: Joe Mather Photography)\n\n(Image: Joe Mather Photography)\n\nNow the family is raising money for the Brain Tumour Charity on GoFundMe as they lay Becky to rest today.\n\nNell said: \"When we got to the weekend before the wedding, we knew she was holding on.\n\n\"She was very poorly, at that point she couldn't speak, eat or drink but she could hear us though.\n\n\"I slept in her room on the floor and every time I left the room, even for two minutes, I'd say goodbye.\n\n\"The night before the wedding, me and my sister Camille decided to stay with mum rather than at the venue the night before.\n\n\"I woke up at 5am and just sat with her as long as I could.\n\n\"And I just said to her 'I'm getting married, it's all right if you go' before I left around 7am, leaving my sister there.\n\n\"Around 9am, we got a phone call at the venue saying she had passed away.\n\n(Image: Nell Cordukes)\n\n\"I think she had been waiting for us to both go.\"\n\nThe family had previously resolved to go ahead if Mrs Best did pass away on the day.\n\nNell said: \"We'd discussed what would happen if she didn't make the wedding, or died on the day, obviously thinking that would never happen.\n\n\"But of course you discuss it, because it was a real possibility, and we'd said from the beginning, you carry on.\n\n\"There was never a feeling that we should call it off.\n\n\"It was always 'mum would want us to carry on so we will'.\"\n\nThey had initially hoped that Becky might be able to attend the wedding but she became seriously ill in the weeks leading up to the big day.\n\nBut Nell and sister Camille, 27, made sure that their mum was still included in the preparation.\n\n(Image: Nell Cordukes)\n\n(Image: Joe Mather Photography)\n\nNell said: \"Matt and I had been together six years and at the start of the year, we decided we wanted to get engaged.\n\n\"Mum fell ill on June 18 but it wasn't until end of July that we found out what the tumour was.\n\n\"So once we knew that mum was poorly, we decided to get married so Matt proposed mid-July.\n\n\"We had hoped that we could possibly have a wedding near Christmas, but there was a chance she wouldn't make it, so we organised it in three months.\n\n\"It was hard but we did the best we could.\n\n\"So I did a lot of it on the side because between the two because mum was always the prioirity.\n\n\"We managed to get mum to see my wedding dress at the shop.\n\n\"The days before the ceremony, when we knew she wouldn't make the day, we played the music that I walked down the aisle too.\n\n\"And my sister read her Maid of Honour speech to my mum before she left in the morning.\n\n\"We just tried to involve her as much as possible.\n\n(Image: Nell Cordukes)\n\n(Image: Nell Cordukes)\n\n\"It was important to us to make that happen.\"\n\nOn the big day, the family made a series of touching gestures to make sure that Mrs Best was honoured.\n\nNell wore a necklace that she had initially bought for her mum as a present and carried her mum's wedding rings in her bridal bouquet.\n\n(Image: Joe Mather Photography)\n\n(Image: Joe Mather Photography)\n\nAnd a framed picture of the mum and daughter alongside another wedding bouquet sat on empty chair at the reception.\n\nNell said: \"We'd always planned to have the chair but on the big day, I got someone to print out a picture of us and frame it.\n\n\"I didn't want to do it when she was alive because it made it seemed like she was already dead.\n\n\"But once I knew, that seemed right.\"\n\nThe family only learnt that Mrs Best was sick in June when she suddenly fell ill.\n\nShe had previously worked as a school teacher before retiring to become a carer for sons Harry, 20, who is autistic , and Thomas, 25, who suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nMrs Best underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy alongside brain surgery in a bid to combat the tumour and Nell says her mum's shock death on her big day has driven her to help others.\n\n(Image: Nell Cordukes)\n\nShe said: \"It's made me realise that life can be fine and suddenly it's not.\n\n\"It's important to do the things you want to do.\n\n\"I want to help more people in the future as we had so many people help us and help mum.\n\n\"I want to be able to do that for others and make a difference.\n\n\"Life is too short to exist, you have to actually live.\"\n\nSarah Lindsell, The Brain Tumour Charity\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur hearts go out to Nell and her family \u2013 it is utterly sad and cruel that her mum died on Nell\u2019s wedding day.\n\n\u201cWe are hugely grateful that she is sharing her story to help us raise awareness about brain tumours \u2013 the biggest cancer killer of children and under-40s in the UK.\n\n\u201cAnd we are touched by her drive to raise money for vital research because she wants something positive to come out of her mum losing her life to this brutal disease.\u201d\n\nTo donate,
