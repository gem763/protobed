What followed was a viral social media campaign, #1000blackgirlbooks, calling for titles featuring black girls as protagonists to be donated. Nearly 4,000 books were donated, and Dias now tackles prejudice and advocates for diversity in literature. Getty 2/14 Rina Sawayama @rinasonline Rina Sawayama came in a blaze of neon and sci-fi coolness in early 2016 when she released the single 'Where U Are', which explored how humans interact with digital media. Since then, the singer and model from north London has been a trailblazer for intersectional feminism. Whether it\u2019s singing about her experiences as a pansexual woman or starting Twitter conversations about cultural appropriation in the media, Sawayama has taken both the music world and social media by storm with her politically vibrant work. A quick look at her Instagram account (@rinasonline) will reveal a confident woman who is not afraid to voice her opinions to her 141,000 followers. Getty 3/14 Chidera Eggerue @theslumflower At only 24 years old, Eggerue came to prominence with her viral 2017 social media campaign #SaggyBoobsMatter. 'It was only small-boobed women who were \u2018allowed\u2019 to not wear a bra,' the author said in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why \u2026 I had to challenge it.\u201d Her decision to not wear a bra shouldn\u2019t be deemed radical, yet here she is in 2019 challenging the ideas that women are pressured to confirming too. Women of all ages and shapes use the hashtag to show pride in themselves, as a result of the body positivity Eggerue championed. Her blog, The Slumflower, also discusses sexism, feminism and racism. Getty Images 4/14 Scarlett Curtis @scarcurtis You may know her as the writer who exposed Philip Green\u2019s willingness to profit off feminism but reject the idea of having a pink pop-up stall in Topshop back in October 2018. However, Scarlett Curtis is a trail-blazing feminist in other ways too. The author of Feminists Don\u2019t Wear Pink & Other Lies co-founded The Pink Protest \u2013 a collective helping young feminist activist to take action online \u2013 in 2017, all while using her social media to challenge misogyny whenever she encounters it. Getty 5/14 Tarana Burke @TaranaBurke Also known as the mother of the #MeToo movement, Tarana Burke is an American social activist who is largely responsible for the international movement against sexual harassment that went viral in October 2017. The phrase was first used in 2006 on Burke\u2019s Myspace account after she responded to a 13-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted. The hashtag gained traction after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged victims of harassment to tweet the phrase. The call-out followed sexual abuse allegations against disgraced film producter Harvey Weinstein and has been used at least 19 million times on social media. Burke is a life-long activist for victims of sexual assault and harassment and continues to campaign such issues on social media. She has single-handedly changed the conversation on sexual violence. Getty 6/14 Sophie Sandberg @catcallsofnyc Tired of being unable to walk down the street without being constantly catcalled by men, activist Sophie Sandberg took to Instagram to expose an epidemic rife in society. Armed with multi-coloured chalk, she began documenting the horrific words that had been said to her all over New York in late 2016. Talking to the BBC about the project she stated: 'By writing [catcalls] in the same place that it happened, I hope the words may remember and think \"Oh those were my words\".' Women around the globe have been inspired by Sandberg\u2019s work and Instagram accounts of women chalking messages have since sprung up from Columbia to Bangladesh. Sophie Sandberg 7/14 Hannah Witton @hannahwitton Hannah Witton is a sex-positive YouTuber and author who has vlogged candidly about sexual health, relationships and women\u2019s issues since 2011.

This is why the star established the mental health community Gurls Talk. It began in 2015 with an Instagram account and now serves as a place to discuss topics affecting women without any fear of judgement. It has since grown into a weekly podcast and a series of organised events that have brought women together from across the globe. Talking to the BBC about the project, Aboah noted: 'At school there still isn\u2019t a place for girls and boys to realise they\u2019re not alone \u2026There is a light at the end of the tunnel. I promise that.' Getty 9/14 Laci Green @gogreen18 YouTuber Laci Green has been educating her subscribers on the nuances of sex education for over 10 years and has amassed over 1.4 million subscribers. The vlogger's videos, which are prominent in the sex-positive movement due to their candour, cover topics such as birth control, hormones and abortion in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding them. Green is also very outspoken against slut-shaming and sexual harassment, being one of the first YouTubers to address the sexual harassment claims levied against vlogger Sam Pepper in 2014. Getty 10/14 Ash Sarkar @AyoCaesar From describing broadcaster Piers Morgan an 'idiot' to declaring herself a communist on Good Morning Britain, Ash Sarkar is a dynamic journalist making waves on the internet and TV.

Meanwhile, her Instagram showcases all her campaigning work including protests on climate change and Brexit. Sarkar is also a senior editor at Novara Media \u2013 an independent, radical left-wing news organisation. Ash Sarkar 11/14 Gina Martin @ginamartin Writer and activist Gina Martin hit national headlines when she began a viral campaign to make 'upskirting' illegal. Taking to Facebook, Martin explained how a man took photos of her crotch without her permission and got away with it in a post that subsequently went viral in 2017. She then launched a petition for her case to be reopened and for the action to be made part of the 2003 Sexual Offences Act. Using the hashtag, #StopSkirtingTheIssue, the petition managed to get over 100,000 signatures. As of 2019, 'upskirting' is now illegal and this is largely down to the efforts of Martin. The activist continues to promote feminist causes to her 40,000 Instagram followers.

Getty\n\nSocial media expert Jodie Cook, owner of JC Social Media Agency, explains to The Independent that our perceptions of what is public and private has changed in a way that fuels this behaviour.\n\n\u201cPeople increasingly live their lives online, and using social media during an argument has become a way for people to put the power firmly back into their own hands,\" she says.\n\n\"Social media also makes it easier for celebrities and people in the public eye to share their news without relying on journalists or publications.\"\n\nAdditionally, some people might find it easier to take their feuds online because they feel vindicated to be crueller in a public space, says digital detox expert Tanya Goodin.\n\n\u201cWe simply say things we wouldn\u2019t dream of saying in real life on social media,\u201d Goodin tells The Independent. \u201cThat\u2019s largely because all the cues that might stop us saying something in anger are missing \u2013 we can\u2019t see the hurt expression on the recipients face or their body language as we let stream a blast of invective.\u201d\n\nSocial media users are increasingly neglecting the fact that there are real people behind avatars and feeds, Goodin adds, which allows this behaviour to flourish. \u201cDisagreements are always much better sorted out face-to-face but we seem to have forgotten that as Twitter spats become the new normal,\u201d she says.\n\nFrom Rooney and Vardy to disputes between Chrissy Teigen and Donald Trump, read on for some of the most explosive social media arguments that have occurred between celebrities in recent years.\n\nColeen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy\n\nThe dispute between Rooney and Vardy emerged on Wednesday. Rooney tweeted a statement in which she accused Vardy of leaking stories from her Instagram account to The Sun.\n\nIn her message, Rooney claimed she had suspected Vardy was behind the leaks and confirmed her suspicions following a process of elimination.\n\nWithin the hour, Vardy, wife of Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy, had vehemently denied the allegations in a statement in which she claimed her Instagram account must have been hacked. Vardy also expressed regret that Rooney had chosen to make the dispute public rather than settling it privately.\n\n\u201cColeen clearly feels she has been tricked,\u201d says Cook. \u201cConducting an experiment to find out who was betraying her was something she deemed necessary in order to find out and explore the perpetrator. \u201cPerhaps this should be kept \u2018private\u2019, but then that depends on what you deem as private. Here, it looks like Colleen is setting the record straight. She lost control over what was made public in the first place, so now she wants her side of the story to be public too.\u201d\n\nChrissy Teigen and Donald Trump\n\nModel Chrissy Teigen is far from the only person with whom the president of the United States has argued online, but she is perhaps the most notable.\n\nTeigen\u2019s repeated Twitter takedowns of Trump frequently go viral, but the animosity made headlines in September when the president criticised her and her husband, musician John Legend, for not giving him credit for signing a bill on criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cI SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, and Republicans deserve much credit,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cBut now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed.\u201d\n\nIn response, Teigen tweeted: \u201cLol what a p**** a** b****. tagged everyone but me. An honour, mister president.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s public feuds are particularly problematic, says senior therapist Sally Baker, because his online vitriol endorses that of others. \u201cSocial media feuds are a top down phenomenon,\u201d Baker tells The Independent. \u201cWhen the US president behaves in this way, it gives license to everyone else to do so. That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing it more and more.\u201d\n\nJames Charles and Tati Westbrook\n\nThe dispute between beauty influencer James Charles and YouTuber Tati Westbrook became one of the most insidious in recent years given the gravity of accusations made between them.\n\nThe pair, who were previously best friends, began arguing in April when Charles publicly promoted a rival brand to Westbrook\u2019s own line of beauty supplements.\n\nFollowing the post, Westbrook, 37, published a clip on Instagram saying she felt \u201clost\u201d and \u201cbetrayed\u201d by an unnamed person and soon unfollowed the 19-year-old YouTuber on social media.\n\nThe controversy escalated further after Westbrook posted a 45-minute long video about the feud and went on to accuse Charles of \u201cmanipulating people\u2019s sexuality\u201d - she claimed the beauty influencer would boast about approaching straight men and then \"cracking\" their sexuality.\n\n\u201cThis dispute was one of the most shocking in terms of power imbalances,\u201d says Baker. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a symbiotic relationship,\u201d she adds, explaining that both parties benefited from taking their argument public because, not only did it make headlines, but it earned each of them millions of additional YouTube views and more followers on their respective channels.\u201d\n\nKanye West and Jimmy Kimmel\n\nIn 2013, the rapper and late night TV host got into a heated Twitter brawl after Jimmy Kimmel mocked Kanye West for calling himself the \u201cnumber one rock star on the planet\u201d in an interview with BBC Radio 1.\n\nWest responded with a series of tweets insulting Kimmel and people connected to him, like his ex-girlfriend, actor Sarah Silverman. Kimmel responded to some of the tweets, mocking West further, before West deleted everything he\u2019d tweeted about Kimmel altogether. In a recent GQ interview, Kimmel said he was \u201cso happy\u201d about the feud, explaining: \u201cI live for moments like that\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese two are bound to disagree because they have completely opposing political views,\u201d comments Baker. \u201cThey are totally polarised but again their disagreement benefited both of them because it kept them in the headlines.\u201d\n\nAdam Levine and Lady Gaga\n\nIn 2013 after Maroon 5\u2019s Adam Levine criticised an anonymous musical artist on Twitter, writing: \u201cUgh...recycling old art for a younger generation doesn\u2019t make you an artist. It makes you an art teacher. I unabashedly love writing and performing pop music for both myself AND everyone around me. That\u2019s It. It doesn\u2019t need any extra sauce.\u201d\n\nLady Gaga, who presumed the tweet was about her, replied: \u201cUh oh guys the art police is here\u201d. Three days later, Levine wrote a tweet that seemed to be in response, writing: \u201cBy the way, I'm NOT an artist. I sing in a band and I make music with my friends.\u201d Levine added: \u201cWhile we\u2019re at it we should call the grammar police,\u201d referencing the fact that Gaga wrote \u201cis\u201d and not \u201care\u201d in her earlier tweet.\n\nCommenting on why the somewhat innocuous dispute received such a large amount of media coverage, Cook said that because both artists are such high profile people, \u201cit might feel like a guilty pleasure to read about a feud between them\u201d so there was an appetite for articles about it.\n\nKim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nSex and the City actors Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker have long been cited in discussions about celebrity feuds, with both actors having made comments alluding to a rift in previous interviews. But their row came to a head in 2018 after Jessica Parker left a supportive comment on one of Cattrall\u2019s Instagram posts in which she revealed her brother had passed away. Days later, Cattrall replied with an eviscerating statement addressed to her former co-star, writing on Instagram: \u201cI don\u2019t need your love or support at this tragic time. Your continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis rift was particularly newsworthy because fans of Sex and the City bought into the fiction that these two were close friends,\u201d says Baker. \u201cBut if you listen to Cattrall, she has repeatedly said in interviews that her and Parker were never friends. They don\u2019t like each other, why should they?\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian West and Bette Midler\n\nIn 2016, Bette Midler criticised Kim Kardashian West for posting a nude selfie on social media. \u201cIf Kim wants us to see a part of her we\u2019ve never seen, she\u2019s gonna have to swallow the camera,\u201d Midler wrote on Twitter. In a follow-up post, the Beaches star urged Kardashian West to put her platform to philanthropic use and encourage her millions of followers to donate to charity as opposed to posting photos of herself.\n\nThe reality TV star responded to Midler in a tweet, writing: \u201chey @BetteMidler I know it\u2019s past your bedtime but if you\u2019re still up and reading this send nudes #justkidding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case was interesting because it was about a golden era celebrity taking on a contemporary celebrity,\u201d comments Baker, explaining that Midler\u2019s comments were intentionally inflammatory and hence garnered widespread media coverage.\n\nLiam Gallagher and Noel Gallagher\n\nThe Oasis brothers have famously despised one another for years and often take their arguments online.\n\nThe most recent exchange to make headlines was after Liam\u2019s performance at Glastonbury Festival, when Liam was accused of sending \u201cthreatening messages\u201d to Noel\u2019s wife, Sara Macdonald, via his daughter Ana\u00efs after Macdonald allegedly labelled him a fat \u201ct***\u201d on Instagram. On Twitter, Noel shared what appeared to be a screenshot of Liam\u2019s message to the teen model, which read: \u201cTell your step Mam to be very careful\u201d.\n\nLiam quickly responded with a public apology on Twitter expressing his \u201csincere apologies\u201d to \u201cmy lovely niece Ana\u00efs for getting caught up in all of this childish behaviour\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a very relatable feud,\u201d says Cook. \u201cEveryone has fallen out with a sibling. But this being high profile relationship makes it fascinating to onlookers.\u201d", "description": "Thanks to the advent of social media, it\u2019s become fairly common for people in the public eye to share their gripes on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or all of the above.
