Previous years there'd have to be Armoguard there, there'd have to be cash transport mechanisms to pull cash off site -- it was actually a logistical nightmare,\" Yap said.\n\n\"It's just another example of a use case where the platform and the power of software allows us to deploy really quickly and get out our capabilities in to the hands of business owners everywhere.\"\n\nGiants stadium in San Francisco is another example of where Square has replaced traditional methods for payment.\n\nSquare Terminal specs\n\nThe device boasts a 5.5\" touchscreen display and a built-in thermal printer.\n\nIt accepts every tap or insert card -- Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Eftpos -- as well as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. Businesses pay one transaction fee of 1.6% for all card and mobile wallet transactions, and get funds in their bank account the next business day.\n\nThe Square Terminal can be plugged into a power source or used completely cordless with a battery touted as lasting all day.\n\nThe terminal can be connected to the internet via built-in Wi-Fi and via Ethernet using an optional hub that is sold separately. Software updates are issued every few weeks.\n\nThe Square Terminal is available from the company's website or physically at Officeworks for AU$439.\n\nOnce purchased, the user can set it up themselves without needing to contact Square.\n\nMORE FROM SQUARE", "description": "Australia finally gets its hands on the Square Terminal, nearly a year after businesses in the United States.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/04/0b973e03-feed-45fd-a6ed-61cfc18d778c/thumbnail/770x578/4ff6b7347b5f6aa15a45bcd9ae6276c6/square-terminal.jpg"}
