They become slaves to a terrible curse, and lord help anyone who enters the house they died inside of. Today we get our first look at director Nicolas Pesce\u2019s take on the famous Japanese franchise. It stars John Cho as a real-estate agent unknowingly trying to sell the cursed house, Andrea Riseborough as a police officer investigating the suspicious activity Cho witnesses inside, and Demi\u00e1n Bichir as another cop who knows better than to go fussing around the place even if there are crimes to solve. There\u2019s also Jackie Weaver looking scared, Lin Shaye looking terrorized, and Betty Gilpin looking like she\u2019s ready to sell your house in a cheesy for-sale-sign photo with Cho. There are also plenty of Grudge-y treats for the fans out there, like the head fingers and the ominous long black hair and what we assume is poor, evil Kayako \u2014 the franchise big bad \u2014 doomed to claim souls in the name of the curse forever. What we don\u2019t see is little Toshio, so hopefully they\u2019re just keeping him as a surprise for later. The Grudge croaks into theaters on January 3.\n\nRelated", "description": "John Cho, Betty Gilpin, and Andrea Riseborough star in the trailer for director Nicolas Pesce\u2019s Grudge, the latest take on the famed Japanese horror franchise.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/28-the-grudge.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
