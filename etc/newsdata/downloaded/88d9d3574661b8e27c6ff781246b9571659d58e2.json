I'll change to 14\u201d.\u2019\n\nBrady has worn No. 12 throughout his entire career. It is a foregone conclusion that when he eventually retires, no other player on the Patriots will wear the number.\n\nThe quarterback is so identified with his jersey number that his own personal brand is TB12, a company that offers nutrition and wellness products.\n\nSanu is a 2012 third-round draft choice from Rutgers.\n\nSo far in his career, Sanu has amassed 377 receptions, 4,300 yards, and 25 touchdowns while averaging 11.4 yards per reception.\n\n\u2018He brings a lot of juice, so it's good to have,\u2019 Brady told CBS Sports when asked about Sanu.\n\n\u2018It's good to see someone that's competitive. If you watch him play, he plays with an attitude.\n\n\u2018He's got a little chip on his shoulder, too, so I think we can relate to each other.\n\nThe quarterback is so identified with his jersey number that his own personal brand is TB12, a company that offers nutrition and wellness products\n\n\u2018And he can relate to a guy like Julian [Edelman], because he was often overlooked in his career, and I think he plays that way.\u2019\n\nNeither the 42-year-old Brady, who is in his 20th season, or the Patriots are showing signs of slowing down.\n\nThey have the best record in the NFL so far this season, having won all seven of their games.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are a perfect 6-0 thus far.\n\nNew England plays host to the struggling Cleveland Browns on Sunday at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.\n\nSanu is expected to be in uniform and play.", "description": "New England obtained Mohamed Sanu from the Atlanta Falcons for a second round pick earlier this week to shore up a thin wide receiver corps.
