REUTERS/Christinne Muschi/File Photo\n\nThe United States has been advocating for greater transparency and protection for whistleblowers at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), after an insider\u2019s account of a 2016 cyberattack at the agency generated fallout when it was reported in the media this year.\n\nU.S. officials have accused ICAO of downplaying the severity of the breach and have called on the organization to be more open.\n\n\u201cWe expect a lot from ICAO. We expect ethical and efficient management,\u201d a U.S. State Department official told Reuters. \u201cWe expect transparent and trustworthy governance. And we expect accountability for performance and conduct.\u201d\n\nIt is the latest instance of Washington clashing with a United Nations body under the Trump administration, which has questioned the value of multilateralism and management practices at the international organization.\n\nThe United States has quit the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, and cut funding last year to the U.N. agency that helps Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), calling its fiscal practices \u201cirredeemably flawed.\u201d\n\nThe United States provides almost a quarter of Montreal-based ICAO\u2019s annual budget of around C$100 million ($76 million), but Washington told the agency\u2019s triennial assembly this week it would not pay \u201cuntil further notice,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nWashington is embroiled in a separate controversy involving a whistleblower who alleged U.S. President Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nIn that dispute, however, the Trump administration is questioning the legitimacy of the whistleblower who provided information on Trump\u2019s July 25 call to the president of Ukraine.\n\nICAO said on Tuesday by email that it had already begun \u201cwithout delay\u201d to \u201cformalize\u201d a new whistleblower policy endorsed by the United States and other countries.\n\nBut the United States wanted the policy to be implemented in June 2019 when it was approved by the agency\u2019s governing council following concerns over ICAO\u2019s resilience against cyberattacks, said the two sources who spoke about the private talks under condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a working paper presented to ICAO\u2019s assembly which is currently under way, the United States said the agency should expand access to \u201cmeeting documents, resolutions, decisions, minutes, reports, documents, and publications.\u201d\n\nICAO spokesman Anthony Philbin said by email on Tuesday that other countries have recently commended the agency for its progress in taking steps to become as \u201ctransparent, accountable and efficient as possible.\u201d\n\nPhilbin questioned the agency\u2019s ability to carry out the safety and security initiatives raised recently in Montreal by U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, given \u201cthis subsequent move by the representative of the United States threatening to defund ICAO.\u201d\n\nThe United States has not indicated it will outright quit the agency, which sets global civil aviation standards that are approved by its 193 member countries.\n\nThe United States, backed by other countries, called for improved management and oversight at the organization following a February 2019 report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp over fallout from the 2016 cyberattack on the agency. ICAO has said it has made significant improvements to its cybersecurity defenses since the incident.\n\nIn a May speech, U.S. ambassador to ICAO Tom Carter said the agency\u2019s council expressed a significant lack of confidence in the existing IT system\u2019s security, and questioned \u201cthe lack of resolve on the part of the secretariat to deal with the issue in a transparent way.\u201d\n\nCarter said in the speech that ICAO\u2019s 36-member council would need to do more to protect employees who come forward with information about wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become clear that we need to strengthen the whistleblower protection program at ICAO and the council has also made that a priority.\u201d", "description": "The United States is withholding its dues to the U.N.'s aviation agency, arguing the body needs to move quickly with reforms like expanding public access to documents and giving greater protections to whistleblowers, U.S. government and aviation sources told Reuters this week.", "authors": ["Allison Lampert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436415295&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911PU"}
