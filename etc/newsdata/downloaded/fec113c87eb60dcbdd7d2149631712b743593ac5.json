SDF commander Mazloum Kobani said on Wednesday that Trump had promised to maintain long-term support for the Kurdish-led forces.\n\nTrump also said a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area \"where they have the oil,\" a reference to oil fields in the Kurdish-controlled region.\n\n\"We'll be deciding what we're going to do with it in the future,\" he said.\n\nIn a sign of growing ties between Ankara and Moscow, the head of Russia's defense sales agency was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying Moscow could deliver more S-400 missile defense systems to Turkey.\n\nTurkey, a NATO member, has already been frozen out of a program to buy and help produce F-35 jets and faces possible U.S. sanctions for buying the S-400 systems, which Washington says are incompatible with NATO's defenses and threaten the F-35 if operated near the stealth fighter.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said the disagreements over the F-35 could be overcome. Despite criticism from allies over the Syria incursion and its growing ties with Moscow, Turkey remained at the heart of NATO, he said.\n\n\"We are at the centre of NATO, and we remain determined to carry out all of our responsibilities fully. We are going nowhere,\" he said.\n\nA senior Trump administration official said the United States still hoped Turkey would not deploy the S-400 system.\n\nAhead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers on Thursday in Brussels, the United States and NATO cautiously welcomed a German proposal for a security zone in northern Syria, though U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said Europe should take charge of it and not U.S. forces.\n\nHutchison also called for an inquiry into whether war crimes were committed during Turkey's offensive.\n\nIn Washington, special envoy for Syria James Jeffrey told lawmakers that U.S. forces had seen evidence of such crimes during Turkey's offensive and had demanded an explanation from Ankara.\n\n\"Many people fled because they're very concerned about these Turkish-supported Syrian opposition forces, as we are. We've seen several incidents which we consider war crimes,\" Jeffrey said.\n\nThere is no indication that Turkish forces have attacked local populations as feared by critics, a senior Trump administration official said.\n\n\u00a9 Click For Restrictions - https://agency.reuters.com/en/copyright.html", "description": "Russian military police started deploying on Syria's northeast  border on Wednesday under a deal with Turkey to drive Kurdish fighters from the region, and U.S. President Donald Trump said Turkey's offensive against the Kurdish forces was over.
