But under the terms of the settlement it has not admitted any liability in relation to paying the fine, which is the maximum possible monetary penalty under the applicable UK data protection law. (The Cambridge Analytica scandal predates Europe\u2019s GDPR framework coming into force.)\n\nFacebook\u2019s appeal against the ICO\u2019s penalty was focused on a claim that there was no evidence that U.K. Facebook users\u2019 data had being mis-used by Cambridge Analytica .\n\nBut there\u2019s a further twist here in that the company had secured a win, from a first tier legal tribunal \u2014 which held in June that \u201cprocedural fairness and allegations of bias\u201d on the part of the ICO should be considered as part of its appeal.\n\nThe decision required the ICO to disclose materials relating to its decision-making process regarding the Facebook fine. The ICO, evidently less than keen for its emails to be trawled through, appealed last month. It\u2019s now withdrawing the action as part of the settlement, Facebook having dropped its legal action.\n\nIn a statement laying out the bare bones of the settlement reached, the ICO writes: \u201cThe Commissioner considers that this agreement best serves the interests of all UK data subjects who are Facebook users. Both Facebook and the ICO are committed to continuing to work to ensure compliance with applicable data protection laws.\u201d\n\nAn ICO spokeswoman did not respond to additional questions \u2014 telling us it does not have anything further to add than its public statement.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the ICO writes that Facebook is being allowed to retain some (unspecified) \u201cdocuments\u201d that the ICO had disclosed during the appeal process \u2014 to use for \u201cother purposes\u201d, including for furthering its own investigation into issues around Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\u201cParts of this investigation had previously been put on hold at the ICO\u2019s direction and can now resume,\u201d the ICO adds.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement the ICO and Facebook each pay their own legal costs. While the \u00a3500k fine is not kept by the ICO but paid to HM Treasury\u2019s consolidated fund.\n\nCommenting in a statement, deputy commissioner, James Dipple-Johnstone, said:\n\nThe ICO welcomes the agreement reached with Facebook for the withdrawal of their appeal against our Monetary Penalty Notice and agreement to pay the fine. The ICO\u2019s main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm. Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy. We are pleased to hear that Facebook has taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to comply with the fundamental principles of data protection. With this strong commitment to protecting people\u2019s personal information and privacy, we expect that Facebook will be able to move forward and learn from the events of this case.\n\nIn its own supporting statement, attached to the ICO\u2019s remarks, Harry Kinmonth, director and associate general counsel at Facebook, added:\n\nWe are pleased to have reached a settlement with the ICO. As we have said before, we wish we had done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica in 2015. We made major changes to our platform back then, significantly restricting the information which app developers could access. Protecting people\u2019s information and privacy is a top priority for Facebook, and we are continuing to build new controls to help people protect and manage their information. The ICO has stated that it has not discovered evidence that the data of Facebook users in the EU was transferred to Cambridge Analytica by Dr Kogan. However, we look forward to continuing to cooperate with the ICO\u2019s wider and ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes.\n\nA charitable interpretation of what\u2019s gone on here is that both Facebook and the ICO have reached a stalemate where their interests are better served by taking a quick win that puts the issue to bed, rather than dragging on with legal appeals that might also have raised fresh embarrassments.\n\nThat\u2019s quick wins in terms of PR (a paid fine for the ICO; and drawing a line under the issue for Facebook), as well as (potentially) useful data to further Facebook\u2019s internal investigation of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly it\u2019s getting from the ICO\u2019s document stash. But we do know it\u2019s facing a number of lawsuits and legal challenges over the scandal in the US.\n\nThe ICO announced its intention to fine Facebook over the Cambridge Analytica scandal just over a year ago.\n\nIn March 2018 it had raided the UK offices of the now defunct data company, after obtaining a warrant, taking away hard drives and computers for analysis. It had also earlier ordered Facebook to withdraw its own investigators from the company\u2019s offices.\n\nSpeaking to a UK parliamentary committee a year ago the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, and deputy Dipple-Johnstone, discussed their (then) ongoing investigation of data seized from Cambridge Analytica \u2014 saying they believed the Facebook user data-set the company had misappropriated could have been passed to more entities than were publicly known.\n\nThe ICO said at that point it was looking into \u201cabout half a dozen\u201d entities.\n\nIt also told the committee it had evidence that, even as recently as early 2018, Cambridge Analytica might have retained some of the Facebook data \u2014 despite having claimed it had deleted everything.\n\n\u201cThe follow up was less than robust. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that we fined Facebook \u00a3500,000,\u201d Denham also said at the time.\n\nSome of this evidence will likely be very useful for Facebook as it prepares to defend itself in legal challenges related to Cambridge Analytica. As well as aiding its claimed platform audit \u2014 when, in the wake of the scandal, Facebook said it would run a historical app audit and challenge all developers who it determined had downloaded large amounts of user data.\n\nThe audit, which it announced in March 2018, apparently remains ongoing.", "description": "Facebook has reached a settlement with the UK\u2019s data protection watchdog, the ICO, agreeing to pay in full a \u00a3500,000 (~$643k) fine following the latter\u2019s investigating into the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal.
