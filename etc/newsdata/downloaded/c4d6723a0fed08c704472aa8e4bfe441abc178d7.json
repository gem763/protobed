USA TODAY\n\nSOUTH ORANGE, N.J. - The most anticipated Seton Hall basketball season in decades is tipping off without head coach Kevin Willard.\n\nWillard will serve a two-game, university-implemented suspension -- Tuesday night\u2019s exhibition against Misericordia and next week's opener against Wagner -- in response to an NCAA investigation into allegations of transfer tampering.\n\nAssistant coach Grant Billmeier will run the team during the two games. Willard will continue to run the 13th-ranked Seton Hall\u2019s practices between the two games.\n\nThe suspension was first reported by Gannett New Jersey. The transfer in question, as first reported by the New York Post, is Pirates junior Taurean Thompson \u2014 who came over from Syracuse in 2017.\n\n\u201cSeton Hall University has been working collaboratively with the NCAA enforcement staff to address an infraction within our men\u2019s basketball program,\" said a statement issued by the athletics department. \"Our department has been proactive in our review and has been fully cooperating with the NCAA enforcement staff.\n\nSeton Hall head coach Kevin Willard will sit out two games.

This matter is still in review, and as a result, we will refrain from commenting any further until it is resolved. Seton Hall is and always will be committed to a culture of compliance, and we will continue to work diligently to ensure it.\u201d\n\nA ruling from the NCAA on whether the two games is sufficient is expected in the near future.\n\nThe suspension is the first of a Seton Hall coach since the Big East hit Bobby Gonzalez with a one-game ban for lashing out at official Wally Rutecki after a Pirates loss to Rutgers in 2008.\n\nTampering with transfers is believed to be widespread in college basketball, but penalties seldom are assessed because it\u2019s hard to prove and aggrieved coaches rarely push the issue.\n\nThompson, who hails from New York City and attended St. Anthony High School among other schools, chose Syracuse over Seton Hall late in the recruiting process. During his one season with the Orange, the 6-foot-10 forward averaged 9.2 points in 18 minutes per game, and he was expected to be a central piece to their 2017-18 squad.\n\nBut Thompson didn\u2019t report to campus for the first day of classes on Aug. 28, 2017.\n\n\"We have been informed that Taurean is taking a leave of absence from Syracuse University,\" Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim said at the time. \"My understanding is he wants to go to school closer to home due to some family health issues.\"\n\nBy Aug. 31, the day after Boeheim\u2019s statement, Thompson was enrolled at Seton Hall. He sat out the 2017-18 season per NCAA transfer rules, then averaged 4.6 points and 2.3 rebounds in 10 minutes per game last winter. He\u2019s expected to be a rotational player this coming season.\n\nBillmeier is Willard\u2019s longest-serving assistant, having come on board in 2016 after previously spending four seasons as director of basketball operations. He played center for Seton Hall from 2003-07 and specializes in coaching big men.\n\nHe has been part of six Seton Hall NCAA tournament teams - two as a player and four in a row as an assistant. That matches P.J. Carlesimo, Tom Sullivan and Bruce Hamburger, who coached together during the golden years of the late 1980s and early 1990s, for the most tournament appearances with the Pirates.", "description": "Kevin Willard's two-game suspension was levied by Seton Hall in response to NCAA investigation into allegations of transfer tampering.", "authors": ["Jerry Carino", "Published P.M.
