Show Hide China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.\n\nOcasio-Cortez arrived in Copenhagen on Wednesday morning ahead of the seventh World Mayors\u2019 Summit held by the C40 group of leading global cities, where she is scheduled to make a speech on Friday.\n\n\n\nShe immediately started posting videos of the city to her 4m Instagram followers.\n\n\n\nThe mayors group, representing more than 90 of the world\u2019s biggest cities, also launched a blistering attack on the failure to agree strong measures to fight the climate crisis at last month\u2019s UN Climate Action Summit, blaming \u201ca small number of powerful governments serving the interests of the fossil fuel industry\u201d.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders met in New York just last month and once again failed to agree anything close to the level of action necessary to stop the climate crisis,\u201d the group\u2019s chair, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, said in a statement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo criticised the failure of world leaders to agree on robust measures to counter the climate crisis.

The city of Copenhagen, which has an ambitious plan to become carbon-neutral by 2025, is showcasing efforts such as apartments built with recycled materials and energy-efficient systems.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Greta Thunberg addresses world leaders at the start of the 2019 Climate Action Summit.
