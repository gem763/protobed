It\u2019s two years of investigative reporting. One of the senior fact-checkers at The New Yorker combed through every sentence,\u201d Farrow said.\n\nFarrow won the Pulitzer in 2018 for his report for The New Yorker exposing sexual misconduct allegations made by multiple women against disgraced film producer Weinstein, after he said NBC refused to air his initial findings of Weinstein in 2016. His New Yorker piece helped to ignite the #MeToo movement in Hollywood and other industries.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed a shutdown of the story. We had multiple named women in every draft of this story; an audio recording of Harvey Weinstein from a police sting operation admitting to not just one sexual assault, but a pattern of them.\u201d\n\nKILLED MY SEX ASSAULT STORY AFTER FARROW'S WEINSTEIN PIECE, AUTHOR CLAIMS\n\nFarrow said that news organizations and other companies burying reports of sexual misconduct and assault or abuse of power are \u201cfundamental threats to the free flow of information.\u201d\n\nHe described a scene in his book where he claims the powers that be at NBC pushed back against having an internal investigation regarding sexual misconduct and cover-ups, to the dismay of some journalists at the company.\n\nNBC News President Noah Oppenheim wrote that Farrow's reporting fell far short of proving that NBC News had tried to conceal anything.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, the general counsel, Kim Harris, gets fed up and says, if the press would just stop talking about this, the problem will go away. And a journalist in the room says, we are the press,\u201d Farrow said.\n\n\u201cJournalists are the hero of this story. We need a free press,\u201d he added. \u201cYes, it is incredibly admirable that people like Chris Hayes have gotten on-air and said, look, if there is a pattern of secrets at this company and people are maybe getting hurt as a result and coverage is getting distorted as a result, that's a significant problem to look at.\u201d", "description": "Journalist and author Ronan Farrow responded Thursday night to reports that\u00a0an NBC executive called\u00a0him a \u201cterrorist\u201d and he defended his reporting about media corruption and abuse of power his new book, \u201cCatch and Kill.\u201d", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
