Even the things they're suspending these kids for are ridiculous. You're suspending kids for YouTube channels and they're saying, 'Oh it's because other kids can't do it.'\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom announced the signing of the bill Monday on UNINTERRUPTED with LeBron James:\n\n\"[The NCAA is] a little panicked because they recognize they're vulnerable. People are hitting this, not just in California, but all across the country because the gig's up. Billions and billions of dollars\u2014$14-plus billion\u2014goes to these universities, goes to these colleges. Billion-plus revenue to the NCAA themselves. And the actual product, the folks that are putting their lives on the line, putting everything on the line, are getting nothing.\n\n\"You can only imagine how we're responding to this notion of name, image, likeness and the opportunity now to do what every other student in the university can legally do. And it's the interesting fact: The only people that sign away their right\u2014the only group\u2014are athletes.\"\n\nThe NCAA has fought against the bill since it was unanimously passed by the California State Senate on Sept. 11.\n\nThe organization said in a statement after Newsom signed the bill:\n\n\"As a membership organization, the NCAA agrees changes are needed to continue to support student-athletes, but improvement needs to happen on a national level through the NCAA's rules-making process. Unfortunately, this new law already is creating confusion for current and future student-athletes, coaches, administrators and campuses, and not just in California.\n\n\"We will consider next steps in California while our members move forward with ongoing efforts to make adjustments to NCAA name, image and likeness rules that are both realistic in modern society and tied to higher education.\"\n\nSherman said the law will lead to change because other states aren't going to risk losing potential recruits: \"If California has it, Texas and Florida have to have it. Because in Alabama, it's college football, so they won't let all these college athletes just go to California, so they'll change the law, and once that changes, the NCAA will change its tune, I'm sure.\"\n\nCollege sports has joined the ranks of professional sports in terms of being a big business. The NCAA made over $1 billion in revenue for the first time during the 2016-17 school year, including $761 million from the men's Division I basketball tournament.\n\nStudent-athletes can get their four-year education paid for through a scholarship, but they are currently prevented from using their image or likeness to make money.", "description": "San Francisco 49ers  cornerback  Richard Sherman  hopes California's Fair Pay to Play Act is the first step toward bringing down the NCAA...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/905/hi-res-012c57fd66696ccf73fa10ab3d01ab04_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
