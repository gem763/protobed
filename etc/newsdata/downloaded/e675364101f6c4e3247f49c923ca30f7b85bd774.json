Photo: George Frey/Getty Images\n\nBen: Lee Drutman wrote at FiveThirtyEight yesterday that Republicans turning against Trump en masse over the Ukraine affair is unlikely, since their electoral fortunes are so closely tied to his. But he notes that \u201cif it does happen, it will likely take us by surprise. After all, political science has shown us that big political changes often come suddenly, after long periods of stasis. Looking back, it seems like of course the Soviet Union was bound to collapse. But up until the moment it did \u2014 and remember, it fell all at once \u2014 almost nobody predicted it.\u201d Can you imagine this scenario unfolding under any circumstances in the next couple months?\n\nEd: I think it would take longer than that, unless the impeachment probe turns up some private chamber where Trump worships at an altar of the Infernal Lord Satan.\n\nMargaret: Yeah, I can\u2019t see that happening unless Trump is found holding a literal smoking gun.\n\nEd: On Fifth Avenue. Near a corpse. The point Lee is making is that if Republican solidarity with Trump breaks, it will happen overwhelmingly. The party isn\u2019t going to let itself be split down the middle on this. It\u2019ll either stick with POTUS to the bitter end or throw him over the side en masse. The former is far more likely.\n\nMargaret: Right, and I think in order for that to happen there would have to be some massive, sudden shift in Trump\u2019s polling among GOP voters.\n\nEd: Yep, no matter what senators privately think, the MAGA base is going to be very hard to shake. And the atmosphere of extreme polarization that Trump has cultivated makes that even harder.\n\nMargaret: The looming election is another complicating matter. It isn\u2019t 2017.\n\nEd: Right, and that\u2019s a big difference from the Nixon precedent.\n\nMargaret: Senate Republicans would have to be convinced that they\u2019re going to lose in 2020 if they stick with Trump.\n\nEd: And like everyone else, they will be wary of underestimating the dude after what happened in 2016.\n\nBen: Many of them already made this calculation once \u2014 and it didn\u2019t go quite the way they expected.\n\nMargaret: As much as Trump is unpredictable, at this point, we\u2019re kind of used to it. He\u2019s going to use appalling tactics to smear his Democratic opponent, but hey, it might work! They\u2019d have to feel it\u2019s safer to see what happens to the party after GOP senators vote to remove a president Republican voters chose in 2016.\n\nEd: Ben, you mean after Access Hollywood?\n\nBen: Yep. Though some broke with him well before that.\n\nEd: That\u2019s a good point, Ben. Go back and read what people like Paul Ryan were saying publicly in October of 2016 \u2014 and what Pence was apparently saying privately. Everyone thought he was toast, and everyone was wrong. That\u2019s probably his ultimate life insurance policy now. Because fixing the GOP in time for an election right after impeachment and removal won\u2019t be easy. And nobody wants MAGA folks besieging their homes and offices.\n\nBen: Today, Mitt Romney tweeted out some direct criticism of Trump: \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d So far, he is the only GOP senator to air anything close to this level of disapproval on the matter. Romney is obviously not representative of his party on this, but do you see anyone following his lead anytime soon? Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado, two of the more so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d GOP members, are both facing very tough reelection challenges next year, so you\u2019d think it might behoove them to at least feign concern over the president\u2019s actions.\n\nEd: Sure, but it takes 20 senators to remove him from office.\n\nBen: Look, I\u2019m not asking for much here. If four GOP senators voted to convict him, that would be kind of shocking.\n\nMargaret: I guess I could see a few more moderate Senate Republicans going the Romney route.\n\nEd: Outside Utah and LDS circles, Mitt is not what you\u2019d call a beloved figure in the GOP these days. And everyone knows an endangered senator or two might take a dive (as might Doug Jones in the other direction).\n\nMargaret: And Romney isn\u2019t taking action of any kind. Maybe they\u2019ll say they\u2019re \u201ctroubled,\u201d but when it comes down to it they\u2019ll find some reason not to vote to impeach.\n\nEd: \u201cLet the people decide,\u201d and suchlike.\n\nEd: And besides: (insert your favorite whataboutism involving Democratic sins).\n\nMargaret: New rule: can\u2019t remove president within a year of election.\n\nEd: Haha.\n\nBen: What about Uranium One? Pallets of cash? The phony dossier? Sometimes I enjoy reciting GOP talking points just to anger myself.\n\nEd: Yeah, and then there\u2019s the babies Dems are murdering, and there\u2019s the awful specter of socialism. The gun confiscations, the outlawing of cheeseburgers \u2026\n\nBen: In the unlikely event that a lonely GOP rank-and-file holdout wanted to pacify their conscience and really go after Trump, do you think they would be actually punished by party leadership?\n\nMargaret: Yes, but probably depends how far they go. Romney isn\u2019t all that vulnerable. But like, Justin Amash is now a former Republican.\n\nEd: Depends. If they need it for reelection in tough territory, they\u2019ll be forgiven. I mean, you need Collins around for the next SCOTUS confirmation, right?\n\nMargaret: It\u2019s not just party leadership, it\u2019s Fox News turning these people into villains\n\nor just refusing to put them on air, cutting off on-air access to their voters.\n\nEd: Yeah, good point. And that\u2019s something else that didn\u2019t exist when the GOP turned on Nixon. Fox News. Much less something like Breitbart or the right-wing social-media hordes. I\u2019m having trouble imagining what it would take to produce a successful GOP-led coup. There\u2019s also the little problem that a big chunk of Trump\u2019s base loves him precisely for his evil ways. Catch him in a crime? They cheer! He\u2019s owning the libs!\n\nStill, Trump makes it harder every day to defend him \u2014 not just because of his misconduct, but because he\u2019s so friggin\u2019 erratic about it. McKay Coppins wrote today about the sheer fatigue GOP members of Congress are feeling every day.\n\nBen: They have my deepest sympathies.\n\nLet\u2019s say the usual not-crazy suspects \u2014 Romney, Collins, Lisa Murkowski, maybe Cory Gardner, do end up voting to convict (though this seems unlikely). Do you think even a limited GOP insurrection could or would have real negative political consequences for Trump?\n\nMargaret: No, I don\u2019t think so. Trump is just going to paint his opponents as deep state elites. Could be Dems, could be career intel officers, could be Republicans who don\u2019t submit to him. If every Republican votes to remove him, he\u2019ll keep complaining that he was unfairly betrayed by the GOP \u201cswamp.\u201d For more on this, tune into his new TV network.\n\nBen: Then he\u2019ll retreat to a forest redoubt with his core supporters and declare a state in exile.\n\nEd: If Trump was not the 2020 nominee, I could see some defections on impeachment causing confusion, much as Gore couldn\u2019t make up his mind whether to run with or against Clinton in 2000. But the party will pull together with so much at stake in 2020, and he\u2019s the leader, like it or not.\n\nBen: Even if his numbers somehow dipped into the 20s and an electoral rout looked all but assured? Would Pence not look attractive in that scenario?\n\nMargaret: I just don\u2019t see it. After 2016, people are convinced Trump has some magical powers. You can go with the devil you know, or roll the dice on GOP voters forgiving you for removing Trump AND embracing his VP.\n\nEd: That gets back to the earlier scenario where rank-and-file Republicans are abandoning Trump (that\u2019s the only way you get down into the 20s). And it would just take a lot of things that don\u2019t seem feasible now. And Margaret\u2019s right: Trump has all of us spooked.\n\nMargaret: Pence is not exactly a populist hero, though Evangelicals like him.\n\nEd: Pence needs to work on his hatefulness if he\u2019s going to carry the future banner of Trumpism.\n\nMargaret: Yeah, he needs to broadcast his hatefulness way more loudly \u2014 make up catchy hashtags.\n\nBen: So, in conclusion, Trump is finished.\n\nMargaret: Haha, yeah, pretty much. This will definitely end with Trump and Pence getting impeached, and President Pelosi appointing HRC to the Supreme Court.\n\nEd: I think he\u2019s going to lose \u2014 not in the Senate, but in the election \u2014 but I may just be projecting my own extreme Trump fatigue onto my fellow Americans. Many of them probably relish four more years of this daily madness.\n\nBen: My fellow Americans, I do not understand you.", "description": "Intelligencer staffers discuss whether President Trump has all that much to fear from Republican lawmakers as he braces for impeachment.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart", "Margaret Hartmann", "Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/01/01/01-mitt-romney.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
