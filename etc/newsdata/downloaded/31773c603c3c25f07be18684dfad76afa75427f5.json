Until now, there has been no single tool for efficiently storing and managing all this information.\n\n\u201cIt can become overwhelming to attempt to organize and manage all of that information, especially from a marketing perspective,\u201d said Faith Larson, GrainBridge chief strategy officer. \u201cIn contrast, STRATUM will enable farmers to conveniently consolidate information on production economics and grain marketing activities into a single digital platform, at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nWith STRATUM, farmers will be able to retrieve their respective agribusiness accounts so they can obtain location information, prices, grain contracts, and payment information, as well as enter into and manage grain contracts. The system currently includes more than 400 grain-buying locations, and Larson said GrainBridge is continuing to add more.\n\n\u201cFarmers are continually looking for ways to integrate technology into their operations, and the amount of information that they will be able to access with STRATUM is going to be powerful,\u201d said Terry Chvatal, GrainBridge chief operations officer. \u201cA farmer can check prices, pull their contracts and scale tickets, make sales, manage market risk and build and administer their planned budget, all without leaving STRATUM.\u201d\n\nHe added that the platform will provide the right data farmers need to make the very best grain marketing decisions. \u201cFarmers will have access to a dashboard of information about their own marketing performance but also highly aggregated, regionalized-based analysis,\u201d Chvatal explained. \u201cHistorical performance, current values of unsold grain and impact analysis, among other key data points, will be accessible.\u201d\n\nSecurity and Privacy\n\nThe system also incorporates features to ensure the security and privacy of farmer information. Only the farmer will have access to their own data with full control, including the flexibility to share their information with those they wish. Grain buyers will only have access to the customer data they provide through STRATUM, such as contracts.\n\n\u201cSecurity and privacy are very important to not only GrainBridge, but we also realize how important that is to the farming community. Most importantly, at no point in time will GrainBridge compromise a farmer\u2019s identity and information,\u201d Larson stated.\n\nFeedback has been positive from members of a farmer advisory board who have tested the new platform. \u201cFarmers have told us that they don\u2019t want another app or software to add to the ones they already have. They want innovations that minimize the amount of technology they have to rely on to make smart decisions,\u201d Larson said.\n\nThe concept for the new digital platform was first unveiled this past fall, when GrainBridge, LLC was formed as a joint technology venture between Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) and Cargill, Incorporated. STRATUM was recently selected as the platform name.\n\nGrainBridge leverages Amazon Web Services to build the predictive grain marketing decision support and grain trading platform for ag commodities. Working with AWS provides highly secure and scalable cloud services for GrainBridge\u2019s farmer profitability platform. In addition to being available to current customers of ADM and Cargill, the platform is open to all grain companies who would like to pursue the application for their customer base.
