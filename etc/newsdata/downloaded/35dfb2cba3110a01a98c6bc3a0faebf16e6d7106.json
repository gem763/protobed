It grew by almost 4,000 acres overnight to 120 km square (47 square miles) and has destroyed 79 structures.", "description": "About 180,000 residents asked to evacuate their homes and power cut for 2.3 million people, as authorities battle blaze.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/27/afd541f4f49b4e47a07c880b4aba08e2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
