First, he gained massive social media popularity when his \u201cjoke\u201d facebook post about storming Area 51 went viral. Then he got nervous when the FBI came to visit him. (That tends to happen if you announce plans to raid a secret military base.) But he perked back up when he decided to turn the event into a big music festival\u2026 Alienstock.\n\nNow, unfortunately, the reality of his situation has sunk in. He was in way over his head and the whole thing was shaping up to be a disaster. Describing it as being likely to be Fyre Festival 2.0, Roberts has pulled the plug and will no longer be associated with the activities. (WaPo)\n\nWith just over a week to go until the event, Roberts and the host town\u2019s website are both comparing Alien Stock to the 2017 Fyre Festival, which was supposed to be held in April and May of that year in the Bahamas but became synonymous with \u201cepic failure\u201d and led to a fraud conviction. Roberts has pulled his name and support from the three-day gathering in Rachel, Nev., but the owner of a motel in the town who had signed up as a partner plans to go ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s no safety or security that can really be promised,\u201d Roberts told The Post Tuesday, calling the event a potential \u201chumanitarian disaster.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable with inviting even my friends and family out to this event, let alone these thousands of strangers.\u201d\n\nRoberts may no longer be facing the possibility of winding up in prison (or dead) for trying to storm the base, but he may still have some legal problems coming his way. His partner in organizing Alienstock is/was Connie West, the proprietor of the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn. (That\u2019s the only hotel in Rachel Nevada and it has six rooms.) She claims she\u2019s already covered a bunch of infrastructure costs and sold 2,400 campsites.\n\nAnd now Robers is just going to walk away and wash his hands of the project? As if the roughly fifty residents of Rachel weren\u2019t already mad enough at this mess, the founder has given them yet another reason to be angry. But what did he expect to happen? Putting together a massive festival hosting thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of people with bands, vendors and food suppliers is a huge logistical undertaking even for experienced event planners. You\u2019d probably need an entire year to pull it off even if you knew what you were doing. And these clowns obviously didn\u2019t have a clue.\n\nBut even if Roberts isn\u2019t going, this thing has clearly taken on a life of its own and there\u2019s no stopping it now. A lot of people are still going to show up at Rachel next week, probably with expectations that are far too high. Some of them may still be planning to get high and take a run at the gates of the test range. If they do, they will wind up detained, in jail, or dead. (The cammo dudes have reportedly killed two people who crossed the fence in the past year.)\n\nThose going for the music festival will, at least according to the town of Rachel website, be very disappointed. The bands that were signed will be playing in Las Vegas instead. There will likely be insufficient food and, most importantly, water for a large number of people showing up in the desert. There\u2019s no place to park and there isn\u2019t even a gas station to fill up your tank. I really hope there are news crews with cameras there, though. I\u2019m sickly fascinated enough to want to see just how much of a disaster this turns into.", "description": "Turn out the lights", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AlienUFO.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
