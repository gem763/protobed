The England boss has preached of the 31-man effort that it will take in Japan, yet this match against the United States was when those words would be truly put to the test.\n\nAs it is, Jones will back up his words with his actions. All available players in the squad will have featured across the two games so far at the Rugby World Cup if Jack Singleton and Mark Wilson come off the bench against the USA on Thursday, which given the four-day turnaround imposed on the squad is highly likely.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut while there could be justification for Jones, there is an equal amount of risk.\n\nThree of the five players retained from the victory over Tonga played 80 minutes on Sunday, just four days before the USA fixture. Joe Marler and George Ford, the other two players backing up, played 50 and 68 minutes respectively, and with five of the replacements also having featured in that match, there is a danger that this physically proves too much an ask.\n\nThere is also the issue surrounding what these fresh players go out and do. For a number of them, they know that if a team for the World Cup final was picked tomorrow, they would not feature. That\u2019s why tomorrow\u2019s match may prove so important to their individual hopes of putting their hand up and impressing Jones.\n\nBut the Australia has a particular way of being impressed, and it is not about players going out as individuals and trying to steal the show.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the danger for us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt can happen in the second or the third game where guys \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen it with South Africa playing against Tonga in 2007 \u2013 players who might think it\u2019s their only game of the World Cup so they go out there and they try to play for themselves rather than play for the team.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cWe were lucky to beat them. A number of guys played outside the team and played for themselves, so one of the most important things in this game is that the players play for the team, and if they play for the team they put themselves in a better selection mix.\n\n\u201cThe World Cup\u2019s not a sprint. No one remembers how well you play in the first two rounds, everyone remembers how well you play at the end of the tournament and the key is to be in your best condition at the end of the tournament. So we want to be better against the USA than we were against Tonga, but that\u2019s the only caveat we have on this.\u201d\n\nWith the USA preparing for their opening game of the tournament after a pre-tournament trying camp on the island of Okinawa \u2013 2,000km away from when England prepared in Miyazaki \u2013 they will be raring to go, having been forced to wait the longest of any nation to get their campaign underway.\n\nWhat defines US rugby? The Eagles will not get the big billing of pride and passion that Tonga got because they do not have a reputation of physicality that goes before them \u2013 which is in a way unfair as Test rugby across the board these days is just as physical as the next game.\n\nEddie Jones has put his faith in his fringe players for England's clash with the USA (Getty)\n\nWhat the USA do bring for the first time though is professionalism. The creation and expansion of Major League Rugby in the States means that for the first World Cup, every member of the squad plays professional rugby.\n\n\"US players have grown over the last two years,\u201d said American No 8 Cam Dolan. \u201cA full-time training environment is massive. We had some guys only training on maybe a Wednesday and Thursday ... working an accounting job or looking after families at the same time.\n\n\"You can train all day, but if you don\u2019t have that match experience, you don\u2019t have the fitness, especially on an international level.\"\n\nWith the USA two places higher in the World Rugby rankings than Tonga, England cannot afford to take them lightly. Normally, Jones\u2019s squad selection would suggest they are doing exactly that, but with the short turnaround \u2013 shorter than any England have had to face at a World Cup \u2013 it is the smart play, yet only as smart as a gamble can possibly be. If England do slip up, it will be Jones\u2019s stake on the line.\n\nRead more\n\nJones defends decision to start Vunipola for England against the USA", "description": "You can\u2019t accuse Eddie Jones of not putting his money where his mouth is.
