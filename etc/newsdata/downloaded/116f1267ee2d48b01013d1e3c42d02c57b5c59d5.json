Brooks: When the U.S. Gov\u2019t Gives Another Country Something \u2014 \u2018There Better Dadgum Well Be a Quid Pro Quo\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "According to Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), elements of quid pro quo when it comes to dealing with foreign governments that receive aid from the United States should be the rule and not the exception nor considered untoward.\n\nDuring an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio WVNN\u2019s \u201cThe Jeff Poor Show\u201d earlier this week, Brooks, who was fresh off participating in the so-called storming of the House Intelligence Committee hearings on impeachment, said when things given to other governments, there should be an expectation from the United States.\n\nHe said it was not limited to investigations pertaining to corruption, as is what is alleged by House Democrats and the basis of their \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be real clear: In every instance in which the United States government gives another country something, whether it be military supply or it be food, there better dadgum well be a quid pro quo,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThere better be an expectation, for example, that military equipment we give the Ukraine is going to be used to fight the Russians. Another quid pro quo is that we have an expectation that Ukraine is not going to give that military equipment to any of our enemies like al Qaeda, the Islamic State, or what have you. If we give food, we expect that food aid to go to starving people. We don\u2019t expect it to be sold on the black market for the profits of somebody who is going to be engaged in corrupt activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there is always a quid pro quo, or there should be, if we\u2019re going to engage in responsible government,\u201d Brooks continued. \u201cThat brings us to the question of whether Trump stepped across the line in requesting that Ukraine conduct an investigation into possible corruption. Absolutely Ukraine should investigate possible corruption. And we should not give any country aid that might be diverted because the entity that is getting that money is corrupt, and people are lining their pockets instead of using that money or assets of the United States of America for the purposes intended. In this instance, we have a treaty between the United States of America and the Ukraine that was signed by President Bill Clinton that obligates both Ukraine and the United States of America, and our respective governments to ferret out corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president should be making anti-corruption efforts a part of any foreign aid transaction with any country on earth,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "According to Rep.
