No doubt that this fall in Nifty 50 could have been steeper if the had shown the same quantum of fall; as most of the sectors were under growing bearish pressure yesterday. On analysis of the Infosys Technology ADR, I find that the prevailing weakness in Infosys ADR may result in more sell-off in Infosys Technology share; which may further push the Nifty 50 more downward.\n\nOn the other hand, prevailing weakness in U.S. equity markets due to prevailing Brexit issue may also continue to extend bearishness in Indian equity markets; may result in the gap-down opening of below the level of 11, 541. Secondly, the current scenario of corporate governance issues with Infosys (NS: ) Technologies looks evident enough to enhance skepticism among the investors about the emergence of such problems with other tech companies too. No doubt that emergence of such issues, especially at the peak-level of Indian equity markets is a historical phenomenon; which finally resulted in a steep fall.\n\nFinally, I conclude that if the opens with a gap-down below 11,541 on October 23rd, 2019, volatility may drag down the Indian equity markets more in negative territory for a long duration. No doubt that the Nifty 50 may take some bouncing move from the current level, but the plethora of negative news flow at the international front looks evident enough to keep the current trend under bearish pressure.
