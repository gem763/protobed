For sure none of that stuff frightens me or intimidates anyone.'\n\nChisora was in fact keeping up the pressure on Hearn for higher recognition. Higher money.\n\nIt is understood that he is now being given a bonus equivalent to a main event commission.\n\nHe was also allowed to enter the press conference last. But Taylor and Prograis will take top spot in the arena this Saturday night.\n\nThe American Prograis spoke with restraint and respect at the final media conference\n\nBoth champions deserve nothing less.\n\nIt was a pity Taylor misjudged the moment to trash-talk in contradiction of his normally modest and amenable character.\n\nHe explained later: 'It just irritated me that he came in trying to look superior to me in his smart suit and sunglasses.\n\n'But I recognise how good a fighter he is, the angles he makes and his evasive movement. It's just that I truly believe I will not only beat him but lay him out.'\n\nChisora and Price face off at the Canary Riverside Plaza Hotel on Thursday afternoon\n\nChisora kept the rhetoric bubbling. He played a tape recording of a lamb braying and told Price: 'That'll be you Saturday night. A sheep to the slaughter-house.'\n\nPrice simply smiled and said: 'Understood.'\n\nThen even Chisora mellowed, adding: 'Actually, we like each other - it's just business.'\n\nTaylor v Prograis and Chisora v Price will be televised live this Saturday night on Sky Sports Box Office.", "description": "JEFF POWELL COLUMN: Dereck Chisora prefaced his Saturday night fight at the O2 by sending an Instagram cartoon to Eddie Hearn of his promoter preparing to stab him in the back.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/15/20137246-0-image-a-36_1571928785723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
