RWC100: 100-81 1/21 Which Rugby World Cup star will come out on top? 2/21 100: Michael Leitch The Japan captain is preparing to lead the side into yet another World Cup, but he proved an inspiring figure in 2015 as his phenomenal work-rate set the example for those around him. He will forever be remembered as the man who lead the side that defeated the Springboks. Getty Images 3/21 99: Lewis Moody A member of the 2003 winning squad, Moody went on to feature on the 2007 run to the final before captaining the ill0fated 2011 campaign. However, with three tournaments under his belt and his sheer bravery in every one of his performances, he just squeezes onto the list. Getty Images 4/21 98: Ben Franks The two-time Rugby World Cup winner lined up in the same front-row as younger brother Owen to help the All Blacks to back-to-back world championships, before heading to Europe. Getty Images 5/21 97: Diego Dominguez A legend of the Italian game. Dominguez played at three consecutive World Cups between 1991 and 1999 and displayed a talent at fly-half that is yet to be displayed since. Getty Images 6/21 96: Toutai Kefu It takes something special to oust Willie Ofahengaue from the Australian No 8 shirt, but Kefu was able to do exactly that to play a pivotal role as the Wallabies' starting No 8 at the triumphant Rugby World Cup. Getty Images 7/21 95: Va'aiga Tuigamala 'Inga the winger' has the unusual accolade of playing at two Rugby World Cups for two different nations. He arrived on the scene with New Zealand in 1991, but it was his role in 1999 with Western Samoa that really caught the eye as he helped them defeat Wales. AFP/Getty Images 8/21 94: Sebastien Chabal A World Cup winner he is not, but Chabal provided one of the great moments in the tournament's history as he lead the confrontation to the Haka ahead of France's 2007 World Cup quarter-final victory over the All Blacks. AFP/Getty Images 9/21 93: Mamuka Gorgodze Probably no better example of a man who has carried a national team on his own shoulders. Gorgodze was famously named man of the match against New Zealand, and his reaction said all that you needed to know about what it means to him to play for Georgia. AFP/Getty Images 10/21 92: Mickey Skinner Who can forget 'The Tackle'? Mick 'The Munch' Skinner sent Marc Cecillon in reverse with one fo the great World Cup tackles during England's quarter-final victory at the 1991 tournament. Getty Images 11/21 91: Stephen Donald Not New Zealand's first choice, or second, or third, but the fourth-choice fly-half who wasn't even named in the All Blacks squad for the 2011 World Cup. Injuries meant he was drafted in for the final against France, where he wrote his name into the history books by kicking the final-winning penalty to end the All Blacks' 24 years of hurt. AFP/Getty Images 12/21 90: Takudza Ngwenya Bryan Habana was considered that fastest man at the World Cup - until Ngwenya turned up and completely roasted him on the outside. The United States may have gone on to lose the match, but the moment remains one of the 2007 tournament highlights. AFP/Getty Images 13/21 89: Thierry Lacroix Lacroix's international career never really took off until the 1999 World Cup when a scintillating 30-minute display paved the way for the All Blacks's dramatic exit. AFP/Getty Images 14/21 88: Karne Hesketh If this list was judged on moments alone, Hesketh would be No 1 on the list. The Japan wing finished one of the great tries to secure their first ever victory over the Springboks, a moment where everyone who was watching remembers exactly where they were at that moment in time. Getty Images 15/21 87: Andrew Sheridan Sheridan played in two World Cup, but is fondly remembered for the way he dismantled the Australian scrum in 2007 to form the basis for England's quarter-final victory. Getty Images 16/21 86: Josh Lewsey Lewsey was one-third of England's elite back-three at the 2003 World Cup, but his tournament highlight came in 2007 when he scored inside 80 seconds in the semi-final victory over France. Getty Images 17/21 85: Will Genia An Australian centurion who was first-choice scrum-half in both 2011 and 2015, where he claimed third and second-place finishes respectively. Will 2019 be the year he goes one better? Getty Images 18/21 84: Will Greenwood The centre enjoyed a phenomenal World Cup try-scoring record of seven in nine matches across 1999 and 2003, going on to help England triumph Down Under. Getty Images 19/21 83: Gavin Hastings Arguably Scotland's greatest ever player, who featured across three World Cups - the final one in 1995 as captain - before hanging up his boots after their quarter-final defeat against the Springboks. Getty Images 20/21 82: David Pocock The main reason that Australia made it to the 2015 Rugby World Cup final, Pocock starred playing out of position in a partnership with Michael Hooper that has strongly influenced the 2019 tournament as other teams follow suit. Getty Images 21/21 81: Tendai Mtawarira Despite his nickname of 'The Beast', Tendai Mtawarira is possibly one of the most understated greats of the game. Fans love him and for good reason, having helped South Africa to third place in 2015.

Both players are suffering with niggling injuries to their knee and have not yet completed a full training session as they are managed back to full fitness.\n\nEngland attack coach Scott Wisemantel confirmed that they remain in contention for selection in Sunday\u2019s match, with the only players ruled out at this stage being Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell \u2013 who will also miss next Thursday\u2019s clash with the USA.\n\n\u201cThe two guys who won't be considered are Mako and Jack, but everyone else is either return to play or fully training, so they all have a chance,\u201d Wisemantel said.\n\nHe also confirmed that there are no concerns over Anthony Watson, despite the wing receiving minor treatment on his ankle during Tuesday\u2019s gym session.\n\n\u201cThey all like to get a little bit of treatment, those outside backs. A bit of love!\u201d joked Wisemantel. \u201cHe's fine.\u201d\n\nAll Blacks put faith in Tuipulotu\n\nExperienced New Zealand lock Sam Whitelock has backed teammate Patrick Tuipulotu to shine if he is selected to replace Brodie Retallick in the All Blacks\u2019 starting line-up against South Africa on Saturday.\n\nRetallick is set to miss the entire pool stage after dislocating his shoulder during the Rugby Championship in the 16-16 draw against the Springboks last July, though head coach Steve Hansen deemed him valuable enough to keep in the 31-man squad in the hope that he will be fit for the knockout stages.\n\nIn Retallick\u2019s absence, 26-year-old Tuipolotu could be selected alongside Whitelock in the second-row, although Scott Barrett\u2019s ban for his red card against Australia last month has now expired to leave him available for selection.\n\n\"He's definitely taken a step to where he potentially can go as a player and that's very, very exciting for him individually but also for us a team,\" Whitelock said. \"It's awesome to see growth in a player. He's probably lost a little bit of weight too, which has meant he's a little bit more mobile but he's still keeping that great strength he does have.\u201d\n\nMoments silence before England vs Tonga\n\nSunday\u2019s match between England and Tonga in Sapporo (11:15am BST, 7:15pm local) will see a moment\u2019s silence take place to remember the late Tongan prime minister Samuela \u2018Akilisi Pohiva.\n\nA World Rugby statement read: \u201cThe global rugby family will pay its respects for the passing of Tonga Prime Minister and former Tongan Rugby Football Union president Hon. Samuela 'Akilisi Pohiva with a moment's silence ahead of Tonga's opening Rugby World Cup 2019 match against England on 22 September.\n\nThe moment's silence will be observed after the anthems immediately prior to the Sipi Tau being performed by the Tonga team.\n\nTattoos in Japan\n\nWorld Rugby are confident there will not be any issues for players with tattoos at the Rugby World Cup, despite body art still frowned upon in Japan.\n\nEngland players at their Phoenix Seagaia Resort are unable to use the traditional Onsen baths if they have tattoos, while hotel guests are also banned from using the gym if they have them visible \u2013 though England have their own temporary gym located in the hotel\u2019s car park.\n\nAddressing the issue across Japan during the six-week tournament, Rugby World Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin said: \u201cThere\u2019s huge goodwill and understanding with the teams about respecting their hosts, understanding that they are in Japan where tattoos carry a particular cultural significance. Many of the teams are very understanding of that, and will be covering with various items of clothing.\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen fantastic goodwill from players towards their hosts and from hosts towards the players and we don't see it as an issue at all.\u201d\n\nIn Japan, tattoos are seen as a sign of being involved in organised crime or being a member of the \u2018Yakuza\u2019, though that perception is starting to ease in public across the nation.", "description": "Ireland sweat on Kearney fitness Rob Kearney will be put through his paces at training on Wednesday in an effort to prove he is fit enough to feature in selection for Ireland\u2019s opening match of the Rugby World Cup against Scotland.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/06/rob-kearney.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
