To make no bogeys in the conditions we played is really more than I could have ever hoped for.\n\n\"I played the last 13 holes wishing I had hand-warmers. The wind was certainly a two or three club wind.\"", "description": "Peter Malnati moved to the top of the leaderboard with a seven-under 65 at the Houston Open in a weather-shortened second round at the PGA Tour event on Friday.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "James Corrigan"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
