This is the third time Johnson has tried to secure an early election since taking office.\n\nMPs will be asked to vote on the election motion Monday, after the EU has decided what Brexit extension to give the U.K. Johnson wrote to the EU last week requesting a delay until January 31, after being compelled to do so by MPs.\n\nThe Labour party and the Scottish National Party have said they will only support an election once a no-deal Brexit has been taken off the table.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell told reporters earlier Thursday that instead of an election, he would prefer to agree a new timetable to scrutinize Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nEven as events continued to unfold, fast and furious, in London, EU leaders were moving ahead with plans to extend the current October 31 Brexit deadline to avoid any chance of a chaotic no-deal departure by the U.K.\n\nCouncil President Donald Tusk has urged EU27 leaders to approve an extension until January 31, as requested by Johnson's letter.\n\nEU diplomats are set to meet to discuss the extension on Friday, which they are hoping can be agreed without calling another leaders\u2019 summit next week. Tusk\u2019s proposal in many ways is designed to allow events to continue to shift in Westminster without ensnaring the EU in Britain\u2019s internal politics.\n\nTo that end, the EU27 could just propose the extension on Friday. However, Brussels could also wait until next week to get a clearer sense of the U.K.\u2019s plans. France, in particular, has said there should be a clear reason for an extension and a snap vote would seem to meet that demand.\n\nTusk\u2019s office did not issue any immediate reaction to Johnson\u2019s call for an election.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell told reporters earlier Thursday that instead of an election, he would prefer to agree a new timetable to scrutinize Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. But he added: \u201cI\u2019m always up for an election whenever it comes and I\u2019ve got my winter coat ready.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson said that Tusk has publicly and privately indicated that it is \u201clikely\u201d the EU will offer a Brexit delay until January 31, although a shorter extension is also possible.\n\nAn election on December 12 will allow a new parliament and government to be in place by Christmas, Johnson wrote.\n\n\u201cGiven this situation, we must give the voters the chance to resolve this situation as soon as reasonably possible before the next deadline of 31 January. We cannot risk wasting the next three months then this farce being replayed with yet another delay in January 2020 and still no way for the country to move on,\u201d the letter continues.\n\nThe letter added, MPs would be given \u201call possible time\u201d to debate and vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill between now and November 6 \u2014 when parliament would be dissolved for the election campaign.\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision comes after he chaired a meeting of his so-called political Cabinet, a meeting of his ministers without civil servants, on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Commons also voted in favor of Johnson's legislative program Thursday, although if the prime minister secures an election this vote becomes symbolic as he would propose a new policy plan should he win.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.", "description": "British prime minister tells MPs to back a snap vote in exchange for more time to scrutinize his Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Eleni Courea", "David M.
