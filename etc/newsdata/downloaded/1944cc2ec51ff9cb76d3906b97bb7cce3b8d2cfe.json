They are partners at Compass Rose Legal Group, a Washington firm specializing in security issues.\n\nFor his part, Zaid told ABC\u2018s \u201cThis Week\u201c that the firm is representing a second whistleblower, language which differed from Bakaj\u2019s.\n\n\u201cLet me also be clear. Although 2nd #whistleblower does possess 1st hand knowledge of certain info, there is NO legal requirement for any #WBer to have such knowledge. Law only requires a \"reasonable belief,\" Zaid subsequently tweeted.\n\nThe original whistleblower had filed a complaint pertaining to Trump\u2019s conversation in July with the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, and Trump\u2018s request for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nIn a tweet Saturday, Trump mocked the notion of additional whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cThe first so-called second hand information \u201cWhistleblower\u201d got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \u201cWhistleblower\u201d is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info.
