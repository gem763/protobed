No doubt the singer was thrilled to be in such close proximity to the Friends icon\n\nSuperfan alright: Before Jennifer appeared on stage, Charlie said he was 'shaking from excitement' when Ellen reminded him the actress was also on set\n\nGetting to know you: This marked the first time the pair had met each other\n\n'You smell so good!' he added.\n\n'She's a good kisser too,' Ellen said, referring to her earlier kiss with Jennifer.\n\nJennifer was back in the hot seat after introducing herself to Charlie, fielding questions about a potential Friends reunion.\n\nAsked if there was going to be a reboot of Friends, she replied, 'No.'\n\n'You smell so good!' Puth was obviously smitten by the actress\n\nSorry! Jennifer disappointed the audience when she said there would not be a Friends reboot\n\n'Listen,' she added as the audience expressed disappointment. 'We would love for there to be something.

I don't want to lead people on!' she insisted after Ellen asked of a potential movie reunion.\n\nEllen quizzed Jennifer on the now famous group photo of the cast, posted to her Instagram account.\n\n'We did it because we miss each other and we all happen to be on the same part of the world,' she said of the snap.\n\nTaking the stage!

A year ago. Eight months ago,' she stammered.\n\n'I don't know! I'm just throwing stuff out there!' Jennifer continued.\n\nSuddenly, Charlie blurted out, 'This is my new girlfriend!'\n\n'This is a good day! I kissed Ellen, I get Charlie,' she said.", "description": "The actress, 50, surprised the singer, 27, on set, where she gave him a warm hug before eventually cosying up to him on the couch.
