She also addressed a larger group of around 150 people, urging action on global heating. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nGreta Thunberg delivered a 15-minute address to around 150 people, rounding off her two-day tour of Capitol Hill. The Guardian\u2019s Washington correspondent David Smith reported from Washington:\n\nThe teenage activist looked a little nervous at first as she took the lectern under a giant chandelier in a grand committee room but then smiled as she resumed her call to arms against the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cThe USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history,\u201d Thunberg, from Sweden, told the audience. \u201cIt is also the world\u2019s number one producer of oil. It is also the only nation to signal its intention to leave the Paris climate agreement because it was \u2018a bad deal\u2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking softly, she modulated her voice slightly to make clear she was quoting, disapprovingly, Donald Trump with the words \u201ca bad deal\u201d.\n\n\n\nThunberg invoked Martin Luther King\u2019s struggle for civil rights and John F Kennedy\u2019s goals that included landing a man on the moon \u2013 \u201cnot because they are easy, but because they are hard\u201d, \u2013 to plead with Washington to lead in the fight, even if it seems impossible. \u201cGiving up can never be an option,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThunberg emphasized the need for urgent intervention and called politicians to step outside their comfort zones and start \u201ctreating this crisis like the existential emergency it is\u201d. Dreams, including promises of green jobs and industries, are not enough, she added.\n\n\n\n\u201cDreams cannot stand in the way of telling it like it is, especially right now... Wherever I go, I seem to be surrounded by fairytales.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe teenager accused business leaders and others of telling \u201cstories\u201d intended to soothe people and make them go back to sleep. \u201cThe problem now is we need to wake up. It is time to wake up and face the facts, the reality, the science.\u201d\n\n\n\nThunberg added: \u201cThis is, above all, an emergency, and not just any emergency. This is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced and we need to treat it accordingly... Stop telling people \u2018everything will be fine\u2019... Stop pretending you, your business idea, your political party or plan will solve everything.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging one disastrous energy source for \u201ca slightly less disastrous one\u201d is not progress, she continued. \u201cRicher countries need to do their fair share and reduce their emissions much more and much faster.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe speech was greeted with a standing ovation and followed by a panel discussion. Thunberg, due to take a train to New York on Wednesday night, was asked about her observations of the way Washington works. She replied: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more calm than I thought. Everything is just happening so slow and people are just repeating the same things over and over again.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have heard so many politicians here say the same things over and over again. If it continues like that, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere. We need to move forward from that and transform words into actions. My impression is it\u2019s very calm, slow and diplomatic, which has its ups and downs.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe also had a message for those who feel depressed or paralyzed by the scale of the crisis. \u201cI started to do something, take action, try to make a difference instead of sitting in despair. That changed my life. It gives your life meaning... To know you can have impact, it makes you feel a lot better.\u201d\n\nAsked what her imagined future 60 years from now looks like, Thunberg replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t thought that far.\u201d", "description": "\u2018Not watching TV or reading social media.
