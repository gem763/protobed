I have to.\u201d\n\nThe 41-year-old actor\u2019s attorney Michael Plonsker said the claims in the lawsuit are \u201cill-informed\u201d and have \u201calready been debunked.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames will not only fully defend himself, but will also seek damages from the plaintiffs and their attorneys for filing this scurrilous publicity seeking lawsuit,\u201d Plonsker said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that to take Franco\u2019s master class, students had to audition by simulating sex acts on film, which he watched to choose candidates.\n\nIt says the class began with \u201cencouraging female student actors to appear topless, then perform in sex scenes, then orgies and gratuitous full nudity,\u201d without the careful guidelines and closed sets that are the industry standard for shooting sex scenes.\n\nThe suit alleges that Gaal was kept out of the master class for questioning its exploitative nature.\n\nTither-Kaplan took the class and was subsequently cast in Rabbit Bandini films, \u201cwhich she now recognizes was a direct result of her willingness to accept Franco\u2019s exploitative behavior without complaint.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages to be determined at trial, an apology from Franco and his partners, and the handover or destruction of video of the plaintiffs.\n\nAttorneys for the women are looking for more plaintiffs to join, and for it to become a class action.\n\nTither-Kaplan previously recounted her experiences with Franco and the school as one of five women who talked to the Los Angeles Times about him early in 2018.\n\nShe was also among the women who spoke out against Franco on Twitter when he won his Golden Globe in January 2018 at a time when the #MeToo movement was surging.\n\nTither-Kaplan later told the LA Times that the Time\u2019s Up anti-sexual harassment lapel pin Franco wore to the ceremony felt like \u201ca slap in my face.\u201d\n\nThe organization behind the pin, Time\u2019s Up Now, said in a statement Thursday that \u201cIf these allegations are true, we hope the survivors, and all impacted by this behavior, receive some measure of justice.\u201d\n\nSince the allegations first emerged, Franco has made few publicity appearances, but work has not seemed to slow down for him on the big or small screen.\n\nThe HBO series \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d which he executive produces and stars in, began its third and final season on Sept. 9.\n\nFranco also appeared last year in the Coen brothers\u2019 acclaimed Western anthology \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\u201d which was nominated for three Oscars.\n\nAnd this weekend he will have two films that he directed and stars in playing in theaters: \u201cZeroville,\u201d an adaptation of Steve Erickson\u2019s 2007 novel that was filmed in 2014 but faced delays in distribution, as well as \u201cPretenders,\u201d with Brian Cox and Dennis Quaid.\n\n\u201cZeroville,\u201d which co-stars Seth Rogen, Megan Fox and Will Ferrell, is already a box office bomb and critical dud. This past weekend it played on 80 screens and made an average of $111 per screen. And \u201cPretenders,\u201d which opens in limited release Friday, is not faring much better with critics.", "description": "Two actresses sued James Franco and the acting and film school he founded Thursday, saying he intimidated his students into gratuitous and exploitative...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS638_franco_ZG_20191003222431.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
