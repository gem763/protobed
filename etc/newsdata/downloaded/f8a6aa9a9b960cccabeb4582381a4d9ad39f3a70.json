We are at crisis point and need to take decisions as a nation on what needs to be done to address the drought.\n\nThe drought afflicting Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard grows worse. Forecasters provide no reason to be optimistic about substantial rains this coming summer, or even beyond. What began as a big problem for our farmers has become a crisis for them, for too many rural communities and indeed, for the nation.\n\nThe line between alarmist predictions and alerting people to the potential calamity we now face, is a fine one. It\u2019s easy to believe it will rain because it always does, eventually. But what if it doesn\u2019t? Or not much? At what point in time do you concede it might not rain, and act accordingly? I believe that time is now.\n\nThere needs to be a plan for what to save and what to give up.\n\nGenerals don\u2019t wait for the battle to begin before drafting their battle plan. They know what the potential scenarios are and they have a strategy for each of them, well in advance of war. They also develop strategies for shaping dynamic situations. Sadly, sometimes they have to decide what must be defended to the last soldier, and what cannot be.\n\nOur government has no formal drought scenarios document, no battle plan, and no strategic responses. The Morrison government is not entirely without responses \u2013 to suggest so would be unfair. But to the best of our knowledge there is no national, overarching strategic plan.\n\nThis is a problem because it may be that we are facing a challenge akin to a war-time situation; a scenario that could require substantially more government investment, the movement of people and animals, and the deployment of every applicable emergency service and defence asset.", "description": "The prospects for rain are at best uncertain.
