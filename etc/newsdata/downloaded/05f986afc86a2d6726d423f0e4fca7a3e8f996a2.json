USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK -- If the New York Yankees don\u2019t have enough problems with the Houston Astros, they took a body blow Wednesday from Mother Nature, and suddenly are in real trouble.\n\nThe Yankees, down 2 games to 1 in the American League Championship Series, may not even be able to return the series back to Houston.\n\nThe rain that postponed Game 4, pushing it back to Thursday, creates the potential of having to play four consecutive games without an off-day.\n\nFor a team that is built to win on the strength of their bullpen, there now is a huge pothole on their road to the World Series.\n\nAnd if the Yankees don\u2019t have enough worries trying to figure out their pitching strategy, look who\u2019s lined up for the Astros:\n\nGame 4: Former Cy Young winner Zack Greinke, who went 18-5 with a 2.93 this season.\n\nGame 5: Cy Young favorite Justin Verlander, who went 21-6 with a 2.58 ERA.\n\nGame 7: And Gerrit Cole, who is now 19-0 with a 1.59 ERA in his last 25 starts.\n\nCertainly, anything and everything is possible in the game of baseball, but right now, you may want to beat the rush and grab those Washington, D.C. to Houston round-trip flights for the World Series.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone makes a call to the bullpen.

He will pitch Game 4 on regular rest with James Paxton scheduled for Game 5 on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get some innings out of our starters, there\u2019s no question about it,\u2019\u2019 Boone says. \u201cObviously, Masa is coming off a real good start in Game 1, so between him and Paxton these next two days, they\u2019re going to need to give us some innings if we\u2019re going to be successful.\"\n\nThe Yankees rotation has thrown just 26 \u2153 innings this postseason -- two fewer innings than the bullpen.\n\nThe Astros\u2019 starters, meanwhile, have gone at least seven innings in all but two of their eight playoff games.\n\nIt may have been fine for the Yankees in the regular season, but after needing to get nine outs in Game 1, 26 outs in Game 2 and 14 outs in Game 3, the vaunted bullpen suddenly is showing cracks.\n\n\u201cThe more you see a pitcher the better,\u2019\u2019 Astros manager A.J. Hinch said, \u201cwhether it's in one game or playing a team over and over. The more you see them the more beneficial it is. It doesn't make it easier to hit elite, but it does give some comfort to the hitter as you continue to mount at-bats against the guy.\"\n\nIt certainly has taken its toll on Adam Ottavino, who has been used in all six of the Yankees\u2019 postseason games. He has faced 18 batters; 10 have reached base. He has given up six hits and three runs in just 2 \u2153 innings, resulting in an 11.57 ERA.\n\n\u201cI still think he's got to play an important role for us,\u2019\u2019 Boone said, \u201cespecially against this Houston lineup. A lot of their great players are right-handed hitters. And just the way we're built and set up, he's going to have to still get important outs for us. I still feel like he's capable of that.\"\n\nWe\u2019ll soon find out whether Boone has the same confidence in him.\n\nMaybe, Ottavino\u2019s struggles will lead to Boone letting his starters go longer, and not being so aggressive with his bullpen moves. He can\u2019t afford to live dangerously by staying with a starter too long, and sacrificing a game, but if they\u2019re going to have any chance to win this series, someone is going to have last longer than the beer vendors in the stands.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to win this series, our bullpen will still play a huge role, obviously,\u2019\u2019 Boone said. \u201cBut we've got to be able to get a little bit of distance out of our starters probably if we're going to ultimately be successful in these next several games.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s the balance you've got to try and strike. We\u2019ll do it the best we can.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd, as for the Astros, well, Hinch can sit back, put his feet up, and do it the old-fashioned way.\n\nWatch his starters go deep into the game, turn to the bullpen in the late innings, and then turn out the lights.\n\nIt has worked for 114 victories this season, so no need to get cute with the formula now.\n\nHe knows that for the Yankees to reach the World Series for the first time in 10 years, they will have to three times in the next four days.\n\n\u201cI like our chances,\u2019\u2019 Astros outfielder Josh Reddick said. \u201cI\u2019d love to close it out right here.\u2019\u2019\n\nThat rain falling from the skies in New York may soon be champagne dripping from the ceiling in the Astros\u2019 clubhouse.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "With Game 4 postponed due to rain, it creates the potential of having four straight games without an off-day, placing a burden on the Yankees bullpen.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
