She\u2019s getting real, and she\u2019s putting out some of her best music ever. That means she\u2019s also doing promo work to let the people know she\u2019s back with a new album, and in a pair of new radio interviews, Gomez gets all emotional talking about how her friends saved her life and how Taylor Swift in particular has supported her through all the highs and lows during a friendship that has lasted literally half her life. \u201cShe was frustrated when I was frustrated, she was sad when I was sad, but more than anything, my friends stood by my side. When I think they visibly saw me in so much pain, they didn\u2019t want it for me, but they \u2014 sorry \u2014 they never stopped loving me,\u201d Gomez says as she chokes back tears. \u201cAnd I played her the song and I played it with her mom and dad and I showed her the video and her mom and Taylor started crying, and it wasn\u2019t because the song was emotional, it was just because the first thing they said to me was \u2018We\u2019re so happy that you\u2019re here.\u2019 After seeing all of that, this is such a cool moment, and that\u2019s a huge thing for me.\u201d Taylor is proud. Taylor\u2019s family is proud. We\u2019re proud. Let the Selena Gomez Big Feelings tour commence!\n\nRelated", "description": "Selena Gomez cries about the power of friendship and how much she loves Taylor Swift in an interview about her new music.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/28-selena-gomez.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
