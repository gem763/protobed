He\u2019s very knowledgable as well, not just about his bowlers and how to take 20 wickets, but about cricket in general.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s got a very good record in the County Championship with Essex in the two years he was there, both times winning (Division Two and then One).\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s a really good appointment.\u2019\n\nThe former England bowler takes over from Trevor Bayliss (Picture: Getty)\n\nFormer England captain Nasser Hussain has also backed Ashley Giles\u2019 decision to appoint Silverwood as Bayliss\u2019 successor.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s a good appointment. He\u2019s a very solid character and wherever he has been as a coach, he has been successful,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018He went over to Essex when they were in Division Two, took them into Division One and then immediately won the County Championship with them \u2013 a side that had been under-performing. He showed his pedigree there.\n\n\u2018He has since moved on to England, and look at the work he has done with the England bowlers \u2013 look at someone like Stuart Broad, for example, and the renaissance he\u2019s had.\n\nOur new Men's Head Coach Chris Silverwood is taking fan questions on the @englandcricket Instagram story.
