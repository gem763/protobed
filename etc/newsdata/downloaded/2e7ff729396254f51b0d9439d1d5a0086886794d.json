KCNA via REUTERS\n\nThe Internet was flooded with online jokes and memes after North Korea\u2019s state media released the photographs. But for North Koreans steeped in years of tightly controlled messaging from the government, the imagery would have been familiar and full of cultural and political cues.\n\n\u201cThe main thing to keep in mind is that while we might think Kim looks goofy, he doesn\u2019t think that,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said on Twitter. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t always like what he does to make us take him seriously.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun devoted its front page on Thursday to making sure Kim\u2019s impoverished people understood the significance of his ride up Mount Paektu, saying it symbolised their leader\u2019s resolve to protect the country in the face of outside pressure.\n\nNorth Korea is under a number of international economic sanctions, imposed because of its development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and a record of human rights abuses.\n\nMany ordinary North Koreans are facing food shortages, international aid agencies say, due in part to government failures, poor weather, and the international sanctions.\n\nTo reassure North Koreans, Rodong Sinmun said Kim\u2019s ride demonstrated his \u201cunwavering resolve and willpower to defend the dignity and destiny of the nation and the people without vacillating under any threat or temptation.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, North Korea test fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile and also walked away from denuclearisation talks with U.S. officials in Stockholm.\n\nKim has said he will wait until the end of the year for the United States to show more flexibility.\n\n\u201cIn this acute battle against enemies, the slightest concession or retreat means a path to self-destruction,\u201d the newspaper said in the front-page commentary.\n\nSTUFF OF LEGEND\n\nFamiliar with Korean mythology, and educated in the state approved history of Kim\u2019s dynasty, North Koreans would have easily recognised the loaded symbolism contained in Kim\u2019s mountain ride.\n\nMount Paektu, a volcano straddling North Korea\u2019s border with China, is sacred to many Koreans, both in the north and south, who revere it as the mythical birthplace of a unified and independent peninsula.\n\nKim Jong Un has often visited the sacred mountain around the time of major developments in North Korea, including missile launches.\n\nAccording to North Korean history, Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, based his anti-Japanese military campaign on the mountain. North Korea says Kim Jong Un\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, was born at Mount Paektu, though historians believe his actual birthplace was in Russia.\n\n\u201cMount Paektu is the location of Kim Il Sung\u2019s mythical guerrilla base,\u201d said Joshua Pollack, another North Korea researcher at Middlebury. \u201cThe location and the clothes are meant to evoke the founder\u2019s legacy.\u201d\n\nIn another front-page article published by Rodong Sinmun on Thursday, a North Korean man was quoted as saying the images of Kim on horseback wearing a fur-trimmed military greatcoat reminded him of \u201clegendary guerrilla fighter\u201d Kim Il Sung.\n\n\u201cIt was as if the voice of our dear marshal making a solemn declaration of history was echoed loudly,\u201d the article said.\n\nMIGHTY HORSEPOWER\n\nAnd the handsome white horse Kim rode evoked Korean legends of steeds with super-powers, like the winged horse Chollima, and another named Mallima, that was blessed with great speed and stamina to run for thousands of miles.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un rides a horse during snowfall in Mount Paektu in this image released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on October 16, 2019. KCNA via REUTERS\n\nNorth Korea named its economic effort to recover from the 1950-53 Korean War after Chollima, and more recently the state has taken to exhorting people to work with the \u201cspeed of Mallima\u201d.\n\nRodong Sinmun called for the nation to move forward at \u201cfull speed, like the swift horse of Mount Paektu, toward a new victory,\u201d and quoted Kim calling for progress on economic projects.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea apparently wants to send the message that U.S. sanctions don\u2019t work,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies in Seoul. \u201cBut in the longer term, they aim to achieve balanced economic development.\u201d", "description": "Whatever westerners thought about images of Kim Jong Un trekking through mountain snows astride a white stallion, the subliminal message sent to North Koreans was to instil confidence that they have a man of strength and destiny holding the reins of power.", "authors": ["Josh Smith", "Hyonhee Shin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441855739&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G11G", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
