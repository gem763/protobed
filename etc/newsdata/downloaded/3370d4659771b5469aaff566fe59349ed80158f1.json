Let\u2019s just process how things have gone for him since he woke up that fateful morning. After finishing off his corn flakes and minding his own business, he was told his wife Moira (Natalie J Robb) was cheating on him.\n\nAfter a quick blast of taking Pete Barton (Anthony Quinlan) hostage and torturing the truth out of him, he headed for a fishing trip with Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter), who admitted to the shenanigans.\n\nHe lost his marriage, clubbed Nate over the head, discovered Nate was his son, saved his drowning wife and then saw his boat blown up. Just another average day for Cain \u2013 but can he accept that Nate is his son? There are still so many questions to answer.\n\nNate clearly came to the village to settle a score with his dad and he deliberately seduced Moira with the sole intention of hurting him. Obviously feeling like he has been abandoned by Cain, it remains to be seen exactly who Nate is and who Cain slept with years ago.\n\nFaith (Sally Dexter) seems to have worked it out after finding a photograph in Nate\u2019s caravan and taking a stiff drink before telling Pete that it\u2019s best to leave them to fight it out themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Cain braved the depths of the lake to save Moira, he dismissed missing Nate as dead but Moira wasn\u2019t prepared to just leave him amid the flaming debris. Nate survived and was pulled to the shore but Cain wasn\u2019t ready to deal with any of this.\n\nHe sped off with Moira shouting after him \u2013 and he was clearly on a mission. But will Faith give him the answers that he needs?\n\nAnd does he have further shocks in store?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Cain has a lot to process.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_nate_cain_moira_02-3040_1571842427.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
