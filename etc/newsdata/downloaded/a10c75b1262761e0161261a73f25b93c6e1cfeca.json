House Democrats have threatened Charles Kupperman, former deputy to ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, with contempt charges after Kupperman not only failed to appear in response to a subpoena on Monday but filed a lawsuit questioning his need to appear at all. Kupperman was reportedly listening in on the phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment probe.\n\nThe White House has ordered current and former employees not to cooperate with the probe, which the president\u2019s counsel Pat Cipollone slammed as a \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional inquiry\u201d lacking in \u201cany legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections\u201d in a letter addressed to Pelosi and the committee chairs earlier this month.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
