We are losing women. And the fact that women are dying when they shouldn\u2019t be in the best time of their lives is a problem,\u201d Dr. Nereida Correa, a board member of the National Hispanic Medical Association, said Wednesday at a panel discussion at the Cannon House Office Building.\n\nAbout 700 women in the U.S. die each year from pregnancy or its complications, with large disparities between racial groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCDC data released in September shows that black and American Indian/Alaska Native women had significantly higher pregnancy-related deaths than white, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women did from 2007 to 2016.\n\nDuring those years, a total of 6,765 pregnancy-related deaths occurred in the U.S., about 16.7 deaths per 100,000 births. Black women had a maternal mortality rate of 40.8 deaths per 100,000, triple the rate for white women.\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native women had a rate of 29.7 deaths per 100,000 births, double the rate for white women.\n\nOver the last three decades, pregnancy-related deaths, defined as death during pregnancy or within a year after pregnancy, have more than doubled.\n\nSince 1987, pregnancy-related deaths have steadily increased from 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births to 17.2 per 100,000 in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is that our country is the most dangerous country in the developed world in which to give birth,\u201d Dr. Kelle Moley, a gynecologist and chief scientific officer of March of Dimes, said at Wednesday\u2019s event.\n\nSome reasons for pregnancy-related deaths include preexisting medical conditions, blood clots, abortion complications, obstructed labor and other direct causes, severe bleeding, pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and infections from mostly after childbirth.\n\nAccessing the right health care services, a barrier for many women, is one of many factors that could impact maternal mortality.\n\nMore than 5 million women live in \u201cmaternity care deserts\u201d or areas where maternity health care services are limited or absent, says a report by the March of Dimes. An estimated 150,000 babies are born to women living in maternity care deserts. Many of these maternity care deserts were located in minority communities or in rural areas lacking health care services, according to Dr. Moley.\n\nTo help reduce maternal mortality rates, Dr. Correa said the nation should model after integrative health systems in states with lower death rates such as California and prolong postpartum care from six weeks to a year.\n\nHospitals can better train medical staff to address life-threatening complications from pregnancies through drills, Dr. Moley said. She noted the need for access to women\u2019s health services for many communities.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
