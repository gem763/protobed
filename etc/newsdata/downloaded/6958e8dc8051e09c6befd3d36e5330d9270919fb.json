The group received US arms, as well as significant air and ground support in the battle to defeat the Isis caliphate. It lost some 11,000 fighters in the years-long war before recapturing the last piece of Isis territory in March.\n\nBut that partnership has angered Ankara, which considers it a terrorist organisation for its link to Kurdish separatists in Turkey.\n\nTurkey has threatened for years to attack the group, but the operation appears to have been set into motion just days ago when Donald Trump unexpectedly gave Ankara the green light to launch an offensive against them.\n\nMr Trump ordered the withdrawal of US forces from the border area, and said the US would not prevent a Turkish attack against its Kurdish allies.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson from the SDF called Mr Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw a \u201cstab in the back\u201d. There are now grave concerns that Turkey\u2019s offensive could affect the security around Isis prisons and camps, home to some 18,000 militants and more than 70,000 refugees.\n\n\n\nThe offensive has been wildly criticised by several world leaders and rights organisations, with the United Nations warning it could cause a humanitarian crisis.\n\n\n\nThe European Union in a statement released Wednesday called on \"Turkey to cease the unilateral military action\" saying Ankara's plan for a \"safe zone\" would not \"satisfy international criteria for refugee return as laid down by UNHCR\".\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
