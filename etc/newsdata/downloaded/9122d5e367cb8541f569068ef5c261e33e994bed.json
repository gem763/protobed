They got me right by recommending a rom-com starring Ethan Hawke, whom I\u2019ve loved ever since \u201cReality Bites.\u201d But they got me oh, so wrong by selecting \u201cJuliet, Naked.\u201d\n\nNow, given that the movie is based on a 2010 Nick Hornby novel of the same name, I suppose it wasn\u2019t a totally bonkers suggestion. After all, I loved \u201cHigh Fidelity\u201d and \u201cAbout a Boy,\u201d both of which also began as Hornby novels. But \u201cJuliet, Naked\u201d is different. I could forgive the movie for not being my kind of funny, but being anti-romantic was the kiss of death. And for a movie marketed as a rom-com, its story wasn\u2019t stellar, but its ending was offensively bad.\n\nThe movie\u2019s title refers to a fictional musical album, but it was a forgettable one, even in the movie. While watching, I found myself distracted, thinking about how I was witnessing the death of cinematic romance in our porn-saturated era.\n\nIn \u201cJuliet, Naked,\u201d we see a likable 30-something woman (voluntarily) trapped in a long-term relationship with a man. She clearly wants children but tries hard to sublimate that desire because he\u2019s adamantly opposed. And while they live together, he largely spends his time gossiping about his favorite retired rock star. At one point, the boyfriend is exasperated he can\u2019t find batteries for his Discman \u2014 because they\u2019re all in his lady\u2019s vibrator.\n\nSince it\u2019s a rom-com, the title character ditches her loser boyfriend (after he cheats on her) and ends up involved with his beloved rock star. But because this movie was made in 2018, as opposed to 2008 or 1998, they don\u2019t end up together. Rather than trying to make a messy but loving relationship work with the charming but flawed musician, our heroine leaves her small British town for a new job in London and sets her sights on single motherhood.\n\nTo say this was a thoroughly unsatisfying ending is an understatement. It completely violated the rules of the genre.\n\nWhat Rom-Coms Should Be\n\nRom-coms have always been escapist fantasies \u2014 fairytales for women, if you like \u2014 so even if film critics pan them, they remain beloved by fans. Where pornography has traditionally catered to male wish fulfillment, the rom-com has done the same for women. The love and the romance are the point.\n\nSome rom-coms are more creative, while others are formulaic (see: the Hallmark Channel), but that\u2019s all part of the charm. The female protagonist might start out in a tough spot, but as an appealing and relatable woman, she\u2019s guaranteed a happy ending. Viewers cheer because her victory is our own.\n\nNow, what that happy ending looks like varies by movie, but by its very nature, that ending is supposed to involve an adult love match for the heroine. Rom-coms aren\u2019t about celebrating single life in perpetuity. Nor are they intended to celebrate career success or the bond between a mother and her child. The latter is wonderful, but it represents a completely different kind of love. No, a rom-com is supposed to champion the sort of romantic bond between two adults that lays the foundation for couplehood and family life.\n\nThe ending needn\u2019t be dramatic, but it should be hopeful. Weddings are nice but not required. There just needs to be a hint, perhaps as simple as hand holding, that a deserving heroine will end up with her \u201cone.\u201d\n\nWhat Rom-Coms Have Become\n\nIn recent years, though, too many moviemakers have seemingly forgotten all of this, or perhaps they\u2019ve simply decided it\u2019s more sophisticated to take heroines in different, less romantically inclined directions. So we\u2019ve seen a shift away from easily lovable heroines who are open to the possibility of true love (think Drew Barrymore in \u201cNever Been Kissed,\u201d Ren\u00e9e Zellweger in the first \u201cBridget Jones\u2019 Diary,\u201d Sandra Bullock in \u201cMiss Congeniality,\u201d or Jennifer Garner in \u201c13 Going on 30\u201c) and toward women obsessed with their careers (Rachel McAdams in \u201cMorning Glory\u201d comes to mind).\n\nMany of these career women aren\u2019t particularly likable (recall Katherine Heigl in \u201cThe Ugly Truth\u201d or Bullock in \u201cThe Proposal,\u201d in which Bullock is the least charming part of the whole movie), and they\u2019re typically too busy \u201chaving it all\u201d to maintain a successful relationship. So these women find themselves in increasingly repetitive stories where they\u2019re being cast as the butt of jokes (\u201cThe Ugly Truth\u201d), or are matched with long-suffering, high EQ men who welcome couplehood (\u201cThe Proposal\u201d). In the latter sort of stories, viewers could be forgiven for wondering why such men choose these women, unless we\u2019re also seeing the heroine evolve to become her best self, as in \u201cSweet Home Alabama.\u201d\n\nWhen a movie declares game-over because a divorced 40-something mom has a post-separation, post-cross-country-move affair with a thoughtful but imperfect 20-something (as happens in \u201cHome Again\u201c), it feels like something\u2019s broken. Leaving aside the matter of the age gap, do we the audience now accept the handsome good guy as a palette cleanser, rather than Prince Charming? Do we no longer want our heroine to find someone worthy of her love and make some sort of commitment that might fulfill them both?\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be so hard to make watchable movies with likable characters who grow \u2014 characters who not only are, or become, deserving of love but also find it. For inspiration, check out \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding,\u201d \u201cWedding Crashers,\u201d \u201cThe Holiday,\u201d \u201cConfessions of a Shopaholic,\u201d \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d \u201cDorfman in Love,\u201d and \u201cAustenland.\u201d These aren\u2019t documentaries. It\u2019s okay if they draw from fantasy. In fact, that\u2019s the whole point.", "description": "Rom-coms aren\u2019t about celebrating single life in perpetuity.
