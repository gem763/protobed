We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.\"\n\nHe then told Zelenskiy that \"Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it's something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian president agreed, telling Trump: \"Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with [French President Emmanuel] Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions [on Russia]. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine.\"\n\nZelenskiy continued: \"It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union.\"\n\nAccording to a factsheet from the European External Action Service, the EU has \"mobilised more than \u20ac15 billion in grants and loans\" to Ukraine since 2014.\n\nBiden investigation\n\nTrump also urged Ukraine's president to work with his attorney general and personal attorney on a potential investigation into Biden, according to the readout of the July 25 call.\n\nAccording to the five-page document, Trump pressed Zelenskiy to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr, on an investigation into the former vice president and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that,\u201d Trump told Zelenskiy, according to the readout. \u201cSo whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\"\n\nTrump added later that he would have Barr get in touch with Zelenskiy and that \"we will get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the Justice Department said it was unaware of Trump saying he would involve Barr in the matter until \"several weeks after the call took place,\" when it learned of the whistleblower complaint.\n\n\"The President has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son. The President has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine \u2013 on this or any other matter,\" spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \"The Attorney General has not communicated with Ukraine \u2014 on this or any other subject. Nor has the Attorney General discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani.\"\n\nThe readout does not include any reference, explicit or otherwise, to the aid money that Trump reportedly directed his acting chief of staff to withhold from Ukraine about a week before the call took place.\n\nTrump also asked Zelenskiy \"to do us a favor\" and look into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine played some role in a cache of emails being stolen from the Democratic National Committee leading up to the 2016 election.\n\nIt comes after multiple days of wrangling by lawmakers to compel the administration to turn over a whistleblower complaint regarding the call. Its release also marks a change in the White House\u2019s strategy of near-universal stonewalling of congressional Democrats.\n\nTrump\u2019s acting intelligence chief had appeared intent to continue to block lawmakers from seeing the complaint in what Democrats argue is a breach of the intel community\u2019s whistleblower statute. It is still unclear if the White House intends to turn the complaint over, but Democrats have asserted that they require more than just the transcript of the call.\n\nAlso at the center of the controversy is the White House\u2019s mysterious decision around the same time to slow-walk hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid meant for Ukraine. The Washington Post reported this week that the president asked his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to delay the funds. And Trump\u2019s public explanations for withholding the aid \u2014 which was eventually released two weeks ago \u2014 have evolved over the last few days. While he first asserted that he wanted to ensure Zelenskiy would prioritize rooting out corruption, on Tuesday he cited other countries' reluctance to provide what he sees as their fair share of aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe president has repeatedly insisted that there was no quid pro quo on the call, denying that he dangled hundreds of billions of dollars in aid in exchange for an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nTrump and his supporters have accused Biden of exerting his power as vice president to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor looking into an energy company with ties to Hunter Biden, though the prosecutor\u2019s firing was widely cheered by the international community.\n\nThe president\u2019s admission that he\u2019d broached the subject of an investigation into a political opponent with a foreign leader was a tipping point for a slew of Democrats \u2014 including vulnerable incumbents \u2014 who\u2019ve come out in support of an impeachment inquiry over the last week.", "description": "\u2018We do a lot for Ukraine \u2026 Much more than the European countries are doing.\u2019", "authors": ["Paul Dallison", "Caitlin Oprysko", "Nancy Cook", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Natasha Bertrand", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170833614-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
