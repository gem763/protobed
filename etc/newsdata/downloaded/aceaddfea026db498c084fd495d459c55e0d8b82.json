I was very surprised.\" \u2014 Charlie Hecht\n\n\"A lot of people have fought and died for our country in combat, and flying an American flag is a good way to respect them,\" Charlie Hecht told Fox Nation.\n\nMAN RECOVERS AMERICAN FLAG FROM BUSY HIGHWAY, SAYS IT REPRESENTS FREEDOM\n\nIn July, Hecht began knocking on doors in his neighborhood and passing out flyers hoping to encourage his neighbors to fly an American flag outside their homes. In addition to placing small flags around some yards, Hecht also teamed up with his local Lowes, offering a discount for neighbors who purchased larger American flags, explained the Chesapeake native.\n\nHecht's community immediately embraced his efforts, and he called the positive response \"overwhelming.\"\n\n\"We just want to inspire patriotism and say thank you to our community...[but] I didn't really expect anyone to take me seriously...I was very surprised that this many people actually went to Lowes and bought a flag.\"\n\nLowes assistant manager Garth Mitchell said he was happy to participate and express his gratitude for members of the military.\n\n\"We 100 percent support our military so anything I could do to help with this project was no questions asked ... what can I do to help,\" Mitchell said.\n\nHecht's appreciation for the men and women who serve comes from his father, a commander in the U.S. Navy, he explained.\n\nAMERICAN FLAG FASHION\n\n\"I couldn't be more proud of Charlie,\" his dad said. \"As an officer of the U.S. Navy, who wouldn't be proud of their son going door to door asking people to put up flags.\"\n\n\"He understands that he wants to be a part of a project bigger than himself and that is, to me, step one in the making of a patriot,\" he added.\n\nHecht is set to receive Fox Nation's \"Unsung Hero\" award on Nov. 6, during the Fox Nation inaugural Patriot Awards in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nOn Monday, Fox Nation announced the recipient of the \"Most Patriotic Sportsman\" award, which will go to Connecticut hockey coach John Krupinsky, who made national headlines for demanding that his players honor the American and Canadian national anthems.\n\nHOCKEY COACH WINS FOX NATION'S 'MOST PATRIOTIC SPORTSMAN' AWARD\n\nAll proceeds from the event will be donated to the Folds of Honor Foundation. The event will be livestreamed on Fox Nation at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nHecht said he is humbled by the award and looks forward to continuing his mission across his community.\n\n\"I don't really think of myself as much of a hero, said Hecht, \"I just like spreading patriotism in my community.\"\n\n\"There were maybe four or five flags before I came out here, and now there is pretty much a flag on every single house.\"\n\nTo watch more about all the Patriot Award recipients go to Fox Nation and sign up today.
