Here\u2019s what to watch this evening\n\nThe Loudest Voice\n\n9pm, Sky Atlantic\n\nGabriel Sherman\u2019s unauthorised 2014 biography of the Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, The Loudest Voice in the Room, receives a mighty adaptation, with a fatsuited Russell Crowe playing Ailes with just the right degree of guile and bombast. We begin with a double bill that is every bit as interesting for its portrayal of the arrival of the 24-hour cable network as it is for the players involved, and is as much a meditation on the modern TV landscape as it is a human drama. Naomi Watts and Sienna Miller round out a stellar cast. Mike Bradley\n\nDIY SOS: Celebrating 20 Years\n\n8pm, BBC One\n\nThe do-gooding DIYers give themselves a pat on the back in this anniversary \u201cbest of\u201d show. As you might imagine, it\u2019s full of emotional gut-punches as Nick Knowles visits families the series has helped. There are also a few amusing glimpses of the show\u2019s slightly less involving \u2013 and certainly less glossy \u2013 early years. Phil Harrison\n\nThe Dog House\n\n8pm, Channel 4\n\nThe Wood Green animal charity opens its doors for a new reality series, charting the process of carefully matching abandoned canines with hopeful wannabe owners. It is a parade of nervous, scruffy creatures with a lot of love to give ... who desperately want to adopt a dog. Gorgeous. Jack Seale\n\nThe Hunt for Britain\u2019s Slave Gangs\n\n9pm, BBC One\n\nEvery year, thousands are forced into slavery by gangs across the UK. Here, 400 years on from the birth of the transatlantic slave trade, Panorama follows West Midlands police as they bust open the biggest human slavery racket Britain has yet uncovered, while former victims share their experiences.

Why? He\u2019s such good company. This three-part travelogue follows him on the 3,000-mile trail of early Scottish migrants from Massachusetts to Tennessee. MB\n\nLost Films of WW2\n\n9pm, BBC Four\n\nA history doc with a singularly intimate perspective, this two-parter views events of the second world war through home movie footage, much of it in colour, captured on early cine cameras. It\u2019s full of astonishing scenes, from Home Guard training sessions to film of the twisted ruins of Sheffield city centre.

Photograph: Allstar/Columbia Pictures\n\nMen in Black (Barry Sonnenfeld, 1997), 8pm, E4\n\nThe first, very funny chapter of the sci-fi spoof in which the world is full of aliens living incognito and interstellar government agents are keeping an eye on them. It\u2019s the reactions to the array of space beasts that give the film its comic buzz: Tommy Lee Jones maintains a seen-it-all-before expression; Will Smith is all wide-eyed incredulity.
