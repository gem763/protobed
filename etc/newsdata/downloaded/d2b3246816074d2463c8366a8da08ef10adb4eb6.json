Her remains were so badly burned that it took investigators several days to identify her by dental records.\n\nThe Hendry County Sheriff\u2019s Office is investigating the death as a homicide, telling NBC-2 it\u2019s one of the most brutal killings the county has ever seen. Investigators said they had no suspects.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say it\u2019s a hate crime yet because we don\u2019t know what the motive was,\u201d sheriff\u2019s Capt. Susan Harrelle told ABC-7.\n\nHarrelle told the Miami Herald there was no evidence Slater was bound and shot before the car was set ablaze, as some reports said. The sheriff\u2019s office said earlier that the body was \u201cburned beyond recognition,\u201d according to The Palm Beach Post.\n\nFacebook Bee Love Slater is the 18th known trans woman of color to be killed in the U.S. in 2019.\n\nSlater had been receiving threatening messages on Facebook in the days before she was killed, her friend, Antorris Williams, told Out Magazine.\n\nSlater \u201cposted messages saying she felt as if people were after her to attack and hurt her and she had a conversation with one of her best friends the day she was murdered saying she wanted to leave\u201d the area, Williams said.\n\nSlater is the 18th known transgender woman of color to be killed in the U.S. this year, the Human Rights Campaign estimates.\n\n\u201cOur society needs to work to ensure transpeople can live without fear,\u201d the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida wrote on Facebook in reaction to Slater\u2019s death.\n\nGina Duncan, Equality Florida\u2019s director of transgender equality, told the Miami Herald it\u2019s \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to repeatedly witness \u201cthe absolute slaughter of transgender people.\u201d\n\nViolence against the trans community reached an all-time high in 2017, according to a Human Rights Campaign report. In 2018, at least 26 transgender people were killed, the majority of them trans women of color.\n\nMultiple outlets, including NBC-2 and ABC-7, identified Slater by her dead name \u2015 her given name before she identified as a woman \u2015 citing information from the sheriff\u2019s office.", "description": "The South Florida death -- estimated to be the 18th killing of a transgender woman of color in the U.S. this year -- is being investigated as a homicide.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7baed53b0000c49fd26da5.jpeg?cache=rcr8t28jhl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
