Hopes of a rate cut and optimism around trade talks have pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to record highs in the last two sessions.\n\nNearly half of the S&P 500 companies have posted quarterly results so far, of which 77.1% have beaten profit estimates. Still, analysts are expecting a 1.9% drop in third-quarter earnings, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nGeneral Electric Co gained 5.2% in premarket trading after the industrial conglomerate beat quarterly profit estimates and raised its cash forecast for the year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc dropped 1.3% after the chipmaker forecast fourth-quarter sales below expectations.\n\nBefore the Fed's policy decision, a Commerce Department's gross domestic product report is likely to indicate that the U.S. economy is losing speed, but not tipping into recession.\n\nThe data, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is likely to show U.S. economy slowed to 1.6% in the third quarter from 2% in the April-June period.\n\nAt 7:15 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis remained unchanged. S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.75 points, or 0.02% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7.75 points, or 0.1%.\n\nAmong other stocks, Mattel Inc surged nearly 20% after the toymaker reported a surprise jump in quarterly revenue on higher demand for newer models of its flagship Barbie brand and dolls based on Korean pop-sensation BTS.\n\nJohnson & Johnson rose 2.8% as the company said 15 new tests found no asbestos in a bottle of baby powder that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says tested positive for trace amounts of asbestos. FDA said it stands by its finding.
