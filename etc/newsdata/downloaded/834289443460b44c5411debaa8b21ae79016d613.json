And it is true that Ravana was a very devout shiv bhakt. Then how did he become the symbol of evil?\n\nLet us explore the myth and legend of Ravana.\n\nRavana is considered one of the most powerful beings to have been born on Earth.\n\nQuora\n\nIn Ramayana, Ravana is the antagonist, the tyrant who bullied the Gods, and kidnapped Sita. This was his act of vengeance against Rama and Lakshman for cutting off the nose of his sister, Surpanakha.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, he is hailed as a king, a scholar like no other, a competent ruler and a maestro of the musical instrument Aveena, known as the Ravanhattha.\n\nDon't Miss 282 SHARES 25.5 K SHARES\n\nAccording to legends Lanka was an idyllic city. It was created by the Vishwakarma, the celestial architect. Kubera, the treasurer of the gods lived there and Ravana threatened to take Lanka by force from him and he did. And even though he literally usurped the land, historically, he is believed to be a competent and efficient ruler. Lanka, the city of gold, flourished under him.\n\nRanak Mann\n\nAccording to one legend, Ravana decided to bring the Kailash mountain (the believed residence of Lord Shiva) to Sri Lanka, to please his mother. When he tried to lift the mountain, Lord Shiva was irked by his arrogance. To please him, the King of Lanka tore one of his arms and made a musical instrument, Ravahattha. He ripped out the sinews to make the strings. Lord Shiva was so pleased with his music that he forgave him.\n\nAccording to mythology, Kaikesi's (Ravana\u2019s mother) father, Sumali was the king of Daityas. So, Ravana was part Rakshasa or Daitya and part Brahman (from his father's side).\n\nAccording to another legend, Ravana carried out intense tapasya to appease Lord Shiva and that lasted hundreds of years (apparently, life expectancy was pretty high at that time.)\n\nIt is believed that Ravana chopped off his head 10 times to prove his dedication to Lord Shiva. Every time he cut his head off, another appeared (now you know why he is depicted with 10 heads).\n\nThe Ravana Diaries\n\nPleased with his perseverance and austerity, Lord Shiva offered him a boon. He declined Ravana\u2019s request of immortality, but he did give him a gem filled with the nectar of immortality.\n\nRavana was also granted the boon of invulnerability and supremacy over the gods, rakshas and animals like serpents. He did not ask for protection against humans because he considered them beneath him (yeah, we know the irony. Rama killed the snobby dude.)\n\nShiva granted him all this, his 10 heads and a huge amount of knowledge of divine weapons and magic.\n\nAn example of Ravana's great knowledge of weapons and science is considered to be the Pushpak Vimana. There are seven books on Ayurveda, written by him, that exist till date. He is also believed to be the author of Ravana Sanhita.\n\nDaily Hunt\n\nAnother theory claims that Ravana was actually a Buddhist king and created most of the monasteries today that are found in Sri Lanka.\n\nNow the question is, how did this wise king who is hailed as a God in Sri Lanka, become the manifestation of evil in the Hindu mythology? How did a Shiva bhakt become a symbol of evil and end up being killed by the avatar of Vishnu?\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Sita haran was not the first time Sita encountered Ravana. According to Hindu mythology, Ravana was one of the kings who was invited to Sita\u2019s swayamvar by her father Janak and the dude was also supposed to be the strongest contender. He actually almost won, until obviously our hero Rama came to the occasion and saved the day.\n\nquora\n\nWhoever managed to pick up the Shiv Dhanush was supposed to be the winner of Sita's hand in marriage. Ravana actually managed to pick up the bow for a while before dropping it. But then Lord Rama entered and broke the dhanush in two halves, thus emerging as the winner.\n\nSo, there is a big possibility that Ravana was already kinda jealous of our hero.\n\nDevdutt Patnaik's writes that it is Ravana's want of materialistic things that led to his end. He wanted Sita and the cutting of Surupnakha's nose by Lakshman was just an excuse for him to abduct her.\n\nBhaskar\n\nHe writes,\n\nRavana stands for everything that Shiva rejects. Ravana is fully attached to worldly things. He always wants what others have. He never built the city of gold \u2014 he drove out his brother, Kuber, and took over the kingdom of Lanka. Why did he abduct Sita? Avenging his sister\u2019s mutilation was but an excuse; it was the desire to conquer the heart of a faithful wife. And during the war, he let his sons die and his brothers die before entering the battlefield himself.\n\nRavana has ten pairs of eyes, which means he can see more. Ravana has ten sets of arms, which means he can do more. Ravana has ten heads, which means he can think more. And yet, this man with a superior body and superior mind submits to the basest of passions. Despite knowing the Vedas and worshipping Shiva, he remains a slave of his senses and a victim of his own ego. He arrogantly shows off his knowledge of detachment but is not wise enough to practice detachment. Deluded, he gives only lip-service to Shiva. This pretender is therefore killed by Rama, who like Shiva, is another form of God.\n\nHowever, one cannot ignore the importance of his knowledge either.\n\nThe story goes that after firing the fatal arrow on the battlefield of Lanka, Rama told his brother, Lakshman, \u201cGo to Ravana quickly before he dies and request him to share whatever knowledge he can. A brute he may be, but he is also a great scholar.\u201d The obedient Lakshman rushed across the battlefield to Ravana\u2019s side and whispered in his ears, \u201cDemon-king, do not let your knowledge die with you. Share it with us and wash away your sins.\u201d Ravana responded by simply turning away. An angry Lakshman went back to Rama, \u201cHe is as arrogant as he always was, too proud to share anything.\u201d Rama comforted his brother and asked him softly, \u201cWhere did you stand while asking Ravana for knowledge?\u201d \u201cNext to his head so that I hear what he had to say clearly.\u201d Ram smiled, placed his bow on the ground and walked to where Ravana lay. Lakshman watched in astonishment as his divine brother knelt at Ravana\u2019s feet. With palms joined, with extreme humility, Rama said, \u201cLord of Lanka, you abducted my wife, a terrible crime for which I have been forced to punish you. Now, you are no more my enemy. I bow to you and request you to share your wisdom with me. Please do that for if you die without doing so, all your wisdom will be lost forever to the world.\u201d To Lakshman\u2019s surprise, Ravana opened his eyes and raised his arms to salute Rama, \u201cIf only I had more time as your teacher than as your enemy. Standing at my feet as a student should, unlike your rude younger brother, you are a worthy recipient of my knowledge. I have very little time so I cannot share much but let me tell you one important lesson I have learnt in my life. Things that are bad for you seduce you easily; you run towards them impatiently. But things that are actually good for you, fail to attract you; you shun them creatively, finding powerful excuses to justify your procrastination. That is why I was impatient to abduct Sita but avoided meeting you. This is the wisdom of my life, Rama. My last words. I give it to you.\u201d With these words, Ravana died.\n\nWoah, that is some heavy stuff. Rama repented killing Ravana because killing a brahman was a sin. So, even though Ravana led a great life, he did give in to worldly desires and messing with Rama\u2019s wife was probably not one of his best decisions. A godly figure apparently is not black and white just like humans. Ravana was grey, just like all of us. But his evil deeds speak louder than his knowledge, and for that he will always be remembered as a symbol of evil, more than anything else.\n\nFb Illustration Credit Ranak Mann: https://www.instagram.com/ranakmann/?hl=en", "description": "Dussehra is celebrated as the victory of good over evil, the defeat of Ravana at the hands of Rama.
