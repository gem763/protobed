But while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are currently scrambling for answers, calls from health officials for more regulation and clinical studies of e-cigarettes date back over a decade.\n\nWith new cases being reported on a daily basis \u2014 \u201cWe believe that probably hundreds more have come in since the numbers we released last week,\u201d CDC principal deputy director Dr. Anne Schuchat told Congress earlier this week \u2014 it can be difficult to keep up with the latest on the outbreak.
