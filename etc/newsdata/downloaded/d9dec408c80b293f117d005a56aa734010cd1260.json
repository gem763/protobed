I'll take advantage of this double-header with Salzburg to talk to them.\n\n'As for Son at Napoli, why not? You can never say never in football. Son likes Italy, the food and Italian people. It's not easy to take him from Tottenham because he costs a lot but, one day, who knows?'\n\nThe Korean has become a vital part of Tottenham's side since joining the club back in 2015\n\nSon has netted three times so far this season, including the opening goal in Tuesday's 7-2 humiliation against Bayern Munich in the Champions League.\n\nHe was influential in the club's run to the Champions League final last season and has looked to ease the goal burden placed on striker Harry Kane.\n\nThe Korean made a slow start to life in north London but is now indispensable when fit, having produced double figure goal returns in his last three Premier League campaigns.\n\nNapoli are continuing to search for extra dimensions to their attack as they look to close the gap on Juventus, who are chasing their ninth successive Serie A title.\n\nMoreover, the Neapolitan side are also preparing for potential departures of both Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens, both of whom are yet to commit their long-term futures to the club.", "description": "The 27-year-old has become one of Tottenham's most important assets in recent years having scored 70 goals for the club since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/07/19325302-0-image-a-26_1570255926589.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
