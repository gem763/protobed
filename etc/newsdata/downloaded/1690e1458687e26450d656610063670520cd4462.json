REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nWilliam Taylor, a former Army officer and career U.S. diplomat now leading the U.S. embassy in Kiev, will be the latest in a series of current and former officials to meet behind closed doors with the Democratic-led House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees in the month since the probe began.\n\nCommittee members and staff are examining whether the Republican Trump abused his office by improperly putting pressure on Ukraine to launch an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival and leading candidate for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony is of particular interest to investigators because of his leading role at the embassy in Ukraine. He raised concern about military assistance being withheld from Kiev to put pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nThe investigation was largely prompted by a whistleblower\u2019s report that Trump may have pressured Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens in a July 25 telephone call.\n\nTaylor mentioned his concern on Sept. 9 to Kurt Volker, the State Department\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, in a text message provided to investigators and later made public.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote.\n\nTaylor was tapped to serve as charge d\u2019affaires in Kiev, where he served as U.S. ambassador from 2006 to 2009, after Trump abruptly recalled Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch in May after she came under attack from his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.\n\nYovanovitch testified in Congress on Oct. 11.\n\n\u2018IMPORTANT WITNESS\u2019\n\nCommittee members said they were eager to hear from Taylor. They want to know about the text messages as well as any telephone calls he may have had with other U.S. officials and with Giuliani, who has played an informal role in U.S. relations with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s an important witness because of the exchange of text messages. We know he\u2019s the one who suggested it\u2019s crazy to withhold aid,\u201d said Democratic Representative Ted Deutch, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nTrump has acknowledged many of the central facts related to the telephone call, maintaining that none of it amounted to wrongdoing or a demand for a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d a Latin phrase meaning a favor in exchange for a favor.\n\nOn Monday, Trump exhorted fellow Republicans to get tougher and fight for him, accusing the Democratic-led House of wanting to impeach him \u201cas quick as possible\u201d because he says they cannot defeat him in next year\u2019s election.\n\nTaylor is the first of just two witnesses scheduled to speak with the House committees this week. Lawmakers curtailed their schedule from seven after the death last week of Representative Elijah Cummings, chairman of the Oversight Committee.\n\nA top Department of Defense official, Deputy Assistant Secretary Laura Cooper, is due to testify on Wednesday. Cooper has worked on Russia and Ukraine policy at the Pentagon.\n\nThe committees made clear they will press ahead despite Cummings\u2019 loss.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to pursue the impeachment inquiry with vigor in support of the investigation led by the Intelligence Committee,\u201d Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, acting chairwoman of the Oversight Committee, said in a statement.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nHouse approval of articles of impeachment would prompt a trial in the Republican-led Senate on whether to remove Trump from office.\n\nFew Republicans have shown any inclination to conduct an inquiry into the president, let alone remove him from the White House.\n\n(Fixes typo in name in paragraph 11.)", "description": "U.S. lawmakers conducting an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump will hear on Tuesday from the top U.S. official in Ukraine, who once said it was \"crazy\" to withhold military aid for the country for domestic political reasons.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443608081&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0DJ", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
