Lang and his accomplice, Alex Zwiefelhofer, who also fought with Right Sector were deported from Kenya as they tried to enter South Sudan in 2017. Zweifelhofer enlisted in the Army in 2015, went AWOL in 2016, and was discharged in 2018, according to a criminal complaint from the US district court in Florida.\n\nThe two are accused of murdering Serafin and Deanna Lorenzo in Estero, Florida. According to the Department of Justice, the couple met with Lang and Zwiefelhofer to purchase $3,000 worth of firearms. Lang and Zwiefelhofer are accused of taking the $3,000 and killing the couple in the course of the robbery.\n\nThe two had planned to commit crimes, including \"committing robberies, hot wiring and stealing boats and/or a yacht, escaping to South America and Ukraine, and smuggling firearms and ammunition,\" according to the complaint. Lang eventually traveled from the US to C\u00facuta, Colombia, via Mexico City, to cross to border into Venezuela and fight the government. From there, Lang traveled to Madrid, Spain, and then on to Ukraine, where he was captured.\n\nRead more: Amid mass protests in Moscow, Vladimir Putin showed up at a right-wing nationalist motorcycle rally in Crimea\n\nThe two are being charged with conspiracy to commit robbery affecting commerce and to discharge a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, robbery interfering in commerce, and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, resulting in death, according to the DOJ.
