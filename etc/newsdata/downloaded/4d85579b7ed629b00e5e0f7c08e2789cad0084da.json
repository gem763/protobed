One of their main goals is to send back enough to allow their families to build large homes that they would otherwise be unable to afford.\n\nOn October 21, days before her family lost contact with her and the news of the doomed shipping container emerged, Nhung wrote in a Facebook post: 'Being grown up means having to hide your sadness in the dark, and keeping a smile on your face.'\n\nA relative looks at an image of Nhung. The 19-year-old wanted to work as a nail technician, according to a relative\n\nNhung's family said she first left Nhung on her journey overseas in August. She went to China first, before eventually making her way to Germany, then Belgium, where they believe she boarded the fated truck.\n\n'I just want a peaceful life,' Nhung wrote in a caption beneath a photo of her smiling in a green field a few weeks after leaving Vietnam.\n\nLate on Saturday night, Nhung's family, devoid of hope, set up an altar in her memory, with her photo next to her father's.\n\nHer father died of cancer a few years ago. Her mother was unable to work because of health complications and so her loved ones clubbed together to finance a new life overseas, Nhung's family told Reuters.\n\nThe missing woman's relatives wait for news about her at her home in Ngh\u1ec7 An Province, Vietnam\n\n'Nhung didn't have the qualifications to get a good job with handsome pay. Nor do her friends and many others here,' said Nhung's uncle, Hoang Binh.\n\n'Going abroad and sending back money was the only choice,' he added.\n\nBy early September, it was not clear where she was, but Nhung was already well into her trip, and reflecting on her next steps.\n\nBeside a stock image of two children flying kites at sunset, she posted: 'As I grow up, I see that life is not as peaceful as I used to think. When I grow up, I want to go back to my childhood, when I lived freely'.\n\nAnna Tran Thi Hien, mother of suspected victim Nhung, sits on a bed at her home\n\nTon Quang Tuan, one of Nhung's friends living in Berlin, said that 'We went out a few times when Nhung was in Berlin' and added that 'she was in a good mood, very happy,' but they lost contact after she said she had to leave for Britain.\n\nIt was not clear how Nhung had travelled from the Vietnamese countryside to China and then Berlin, but the German capital has emerged in recent years as a staging ground for Vietnamese and other migrants looking to start new lives in Britain.\n\n'I feel lonely in the place I used to dream of everyday,' Nhung wrote on September 25.\n\nIt was unclear where she was - Vietnamese smugglers are said to advise their subjects to live discreetly and not to give away too many clues in order to evade detection from the authorities.\n\nThe family heard from a friend living in the UK that 'Nhung is one of the victims,' said one of Nhung's relatives, who was visiting the missing teen's despaired mother. Pictured: The family wait for news about Nhung\n\nA few days later, Nhung was pictured outside Berlin Cathedral with a cup of bubble tea in her hands.\n\nBy late October, Nhung was in Belgium. She posted photos of herself, again with a cup of bubble tea in her hand, excitedly exploring the sights of Brussels, including the old stock exchange and the bustling Rue Auguste Orts thoroughfare.\n\nIt was from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge that the doomed container eventually departed. Her family believe that she was on board.\n\nIn Berlin, Nhung wrote: 'Back in Vietnam, I thought Europe was pink. But it turns out it's black'.\n\n\n\n'Sorry mum, I can't breathe': The harrowing messages sent from inside the lorry by a victim who only wanted 'a better life'\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed\n\nSuspected victim Pham Thi Tra My, 26, from Vietnam sent her mother a series of harrowing messages telling her she 'loved her' and was 'dying because she couldn't breathe' in the moments before her death, her family have claimed.\n\nThey claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'.\n\nShe is from Ha Tinh, an impoverished province in a part of Vietnam where many of the country's illegal migrants come from.\n\nNguyen Thi Phong and Pham Van Thin, told CNN it was 'very painful' to receive the text - saying she must have known she was going to die when she sent it.\n\n'I've lost both my loved one and my money,' her father Pham said, claiming he and his partner scraped together the money to pay for their daughter to travel to the UK.\n\nThe pair, who make around $400 a month between them, said the smugglers did not tell them how their daughter would be transported to the UK.\n\n'The smugglers said that this was a ... safe route, that people would go by airplane, car ... if I had known she would go by this route, I would not have let her go,' Pham added.\n\nHer family claim to have paid people smugglers \u00a330,000 for their daughter to travel to the UK via China 'in search of a better life'\n\nA human rights worker in Vietnam, who has spoken with Tra My's family, revealed she made the perilous journey because her family was in debt and she was desperately trying to help them.\n\n'She had just returned from Japan where she was working to try and pay off the debt. And that was not enough and so she looked for a better future,' she told the BBC.\n\nAsking to remain anonymous, the human rights worker continued: 'For this girl it is very sad that she took the risk because she was dealing with debt that was created by another man in the family.\n\n'And I also learnt that the service that she was using was called 'very important service' and so it is like a business class ticket on the lorry and with that she had to pay double or three times the price of the cheap ticket.'\n\nIn text messages sent at 10.28pm GMT on Tuesday, Pham Thi Tra told her mother, 'I love you so much...I'm sorry.' Pictured, The screenshot of Tra My's last text\n\nThe human rights worker added that migrants are told they can vast amounts of money by moving to the UK, and the 26-year-old may have been convinced to purchase a 'VIP ticket' to get there.\n\nHe family mortgaged the house to get that money for her, the human rights worked added.\n\nPham Thi Tra's last text messages were sent at 10.28pm BST on Tuesday - two hours before the truck reached the UK, as it was en route from Belgium.\n\nShe told her mother: 'I'm sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn't succeeded. Mum, I love you so much. I'm dying because I can't breathe.'\n\nTra My's brother told the BBC on Friday that his sister had told them not to contact her because 'the organisers' did not allow her to receive calls.\n\nHe said she flew to China from her home in Can L\u1ed9c, a rural district of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province in Vietnam, then left for France and initially attempted to cross the border into the UK on October 19, but 'got caught' and turned back.\n\nPham Van Thin (right) and Nguyen Thi Phong (left), father and mother of Tra My.

He had said he would join a group in Paris that was trying to reach England.\n\n'He often called home but I haven't been able to reach him since the last time we talked last week,' Nguyen Dinh Gia said.

He shouldn't worry about money, I'll take care of it.'\n\nHe said his son left home in central Ha Tinh province to work in Russia in 2017, then on to Ukraine. In April 2018, he arrived in Germany then traveled to France. He told his family that he wanted to go to the UK.\n\nLuong's older brother, Pham Dinh Hai, said that Luong had a tattoo of praying hands on a cross on his right shoulder.

'I have a big debt to pay, no hope, and no energy to do anything'.\n\nTu's father said relatives in the United Kingdom had told him that Tu was inside the truck, and had been planning to pick him up.\n\n'They were supposed to pick him up at the drop-off point but they called and said Tu was in that truck,' Tu's father, Nguyen Dinh Sat, said.\n\n'I haven't heard anything from my son'.\n\nTu had a few months ago asked his wife Hoang Thi Thuong (pictured with her son) to help him raise \u00a311,000 ($14,000) to cover the cost of an illicit trip from Germany to the United Kingdom\n\nMs Hoang (right) cries as her mother holds her son Nguyen Dinh Dan\n\nFather-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, is also feared to have been in the ill-fated container\n\nA father-of-two who asked his family to pray for his safe journey to Britain\n\nFather-of-two Vo Ngoc Nam, 28, is also feared to have been in the ill-fated container.\n\nHis wife, Ta Thi Oanh, told Vietnamese media that he had called her last Tuesday afternoon to say he was on the truck going to Britain.\n\nHe asked her to call her parents and ask them to pray for him, but has not been heard of since.\n\nMr Nam\u2019s father, Vo Ngoc Luyen, said: \u2018After reading information about the 39 people in the container in the UK, my family is extremely shocked.
