The majority of sub-indexes also continued to decline, but at a slow pace.\n\nThe sub-index for new export orders rose to 48.6 from 45.5 in July, the slowest decline seen since April, but the 13th straight month of contraction. Survey respondents reported cooling demand from Germany, China, Japan and parts of Southeast Asia.\n\nTotal new orders also shrank for a 10th successive month, due to reduced demand for goods both at home and abroad.\n\nThough some firms in the electronics industry launched new products, those failed to offset the cut back from elsewhere, extending the contraction for a 10th month.\n\n\u201cWhile the pick-up in the headline index suggests that pressures on South Korean manufacturers have abated to an extent, underlying data still portray a deeply challenging environment,\u201d said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.\n\nSouth Korea, Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, has been struggling with sluggish exports and weak inflation, while the U.S.-China tit-for-tat tariff dispute and a brewing trade row with Japan pose increasing growth risks.\n\nGross domestic product swung back to growth in the June quarter after a shock contraction in the previous period, but that was mostly due to increased government spending, not a pick up in demand.\n\nThe employment sub-indexes showed factories cutting staff at the fastest pace in six months to deal with reduced sales and price pressures driven by a weaker won KRW=, increased raw material and payroll costs.\n\nSouth Korean manufacturers restored confidence marginally in August after July\u2019s future output index fell below the threshold for the first time since sentiment was tracked in 2012. But the bitter feud between the nation and Japan and faltering economy still weighed on the business sentiment.\n\nOn Friday, the Bank of Korea kept the benchmark interest rate KROCRT=ECI unchanged at 1.50%, which followed a surprise rate cut in July, but is widely expected to ease at the next meeting in October.", "description": "South Korea's factory activity shrank in August but at a slower pace than in July, a private sector survey showed on Monday, as global trade frictions and an escalating diplomatic dispute with Japan hit demand for the country's products.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425222600&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8100N"}
