Nor was it only the Conservatives.'\n\nNonetheless, it's clear that the Archbishop has a bone to pick with his fellow Old Etonian in Downing Street: he was essentially taking the side of Ms Sherriff.\n\nLabour MP Paula Sherriff (pictured in Parliament) made a demand for Boris Johnson moderate his language to reduce the number of abusive and threatening messages that parliamentarians were receiving\n\nRiled\n\nTo remind readers \u2014 this particular incident occurred more than a month ago \u2014 the MP for Dewsbury claimed that she and other MPs had received death threats, adding, 'and let me tell the Prime Minister that they often quote his words. Surrender act. Betrayal. Traitor. And I for one am sick of it.'\n\nJohnson replied: 'I have to say I have never heard so much humbug in my life.' Which did not exactly calm things down and restore peace in the Commons.\n\nBut then Parliament is an adversarial chamber. Unlike continental parliaments, the seating is not horseshoe-shaped but two-sided.\n\nAnd the size of the gap between the two front benches was originally described as 'two swords' length' \u2014 the point supposedly being that the political opponents would not be able to lock sabres from a sedentary position.\n\nAs for language, Parliament over the centuries has heard much more explosive terms than any Boris Johnson has used.\n\nAnd it is simply not true that he had used the admittedly inflammatory word 'traitor'. He never has, and the BBC was forced to retract the claim after it repeated Ms Sherriff's accusation.\n\nPM Boris Johnson (pictured) dismissed Ms Sherriff's demands as 'humbug'\n\nAs for 'betrayal', Ms Sherriff herself is fond of using that very term. For example, she has described the Government's schools funding as an 'appalling betrayal' of our children.\n\nThis perhaps helps explain why the PM \u2014 heckled at high volume with some choice un-parliamentary terms as he stood up to respond \u2014 was sufficiently riled to accuse his critic of 'humbug'.\n\nAs it happens, the Archbishop is himself not averse to using robust language when discussing the domestic politics of leaving the European Union.\n\nIn August, when addressing the Greenbelt Festival of faith and arts, Welby declared: 'We have to take seriously the fact that the majority voted Leave. We may not like it, but that is democracy: and that means we have to stop whingeing about it and do something about reuniting the country.'\n\nI thought it was good that the undisguisedly pro-Remain Archbishop had issued this advice to those on his side of the argument who were refusing to accept the result of the ballot box.\n\nBut, oh, the wailing that greeted Welby's use of the word 'whingeing'! So much wailing, in fact, that the Archbishop felt obliged to retract the term.\n\nA few days later, he put up the following on his Facebook page: 'Clearly, I expressed myself carelessly and insensitively in the moment. I apologise for that and the hurt that people have felt.'\n\nBut he went on to reiterate that he was 'very clear that the referendum result must be honoured' and that this was essential for the matter to be resolved.\n\nWhether Welby realises it or not, he is thus in complete agreement with the further argument that Boris Johnson put forward in the Commons during that fraught series of exchanges.\n\nMr Johnson said: 'The best way to bring this country together would be to get Brexit done, and I think that it is the continuing inability of this Parliament to get Brexit done that is causing the anxiety and ill-feeling that is now rampant in this country. Get it done and we will solve the problem.'\n\nImpasse\n\nThat may be too optimistic a view, but optimism is the PM's major key. He has a fundamentally sunny, positive outlook.\n\nThis is where he differs from Justin Welby, who has a pronounced tendency to accentuate the negative. Indeed, the Archbishop recently \u2014 and courageously \u2014 admitted that he had been clinically depressed.\n\nPerhaps it is in this context that we should interpret his other reported remarks yesterday, in which he warned that there was an unprecedented amount of 'division at almost every level of society, including the political level of society. I don't only blame government. I think we are quite broken'.\n\nIt's certainly gloomsville at Lambeth Palace. But less so in the country as a whole \u2014 at least if the Office for National Statistics is to be believed.\n\nLast week, it produced its latest annual report of the so-called Happiness Index. This showed that the average 'happiness' score recorded by Britons responding to its vast survey was 7.56 out of 10.\n\nIn the previous year, the figure was 7.52. Levels of 'life satisfaction' had improved at their fastest rate in England and Wales since 2013. Even the Scots were less gloomy. And, overall: 'Levels of satisfaction with life have edged upwards over a longer period while rates of anxiety have gone down.'\n\nThe Archbishop has perhaps been over-influenced by his exposure to the denizens of the House of Commons, which, after all, is only half a mile from Lambeth Palace. While for the vast majority of us, the political impasse over Brexit is not something we think about continually, in Westminster it amounts to nothing less than a full-time nervous breakdown.\n\nOne Labour MP told me that Parliament is 'suffering from a form of Brexit-related post-traumatic stress disorder. The atmosphere is so unhealthy and poisonous, it can no longer do its job'.\n\nFebrile\n\nArchbishop Welby said something very similar in his interview over the weekend, revealing that MPs and working peers at Westminster had been approaching him for guidance: 'They don't know what to do. The stress is enormous.'\n\nI don't wish to seem insensitive (though I am), but the best way to release that Brexit-induced stress would indeed be to get the thing done, rather than continue to agonise over it.\n\nOr have a general election, which at least would clear the fetid fumes of a parliament in a state resembling rigor mortis.\n\nMeanwhile, I suggest the Archbishop stops worrying about what Mr Johnson said in a debate in September, in the febrile atmosphere before he got his deal with the EU, but instead reads the PM's opening words in the much more recent debate on the Withdrawal Deal on the day it gained its Second Reading:\n\n'In the three-and-a-half years after the nation voted for Brexit, friendships have been strained, families divided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution.\n\n'But I hope, Mr Speaker, that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us \u2026\n\n'If we have been sceptical [about the EU] and if we have been anxious about the remoteness of the bureaucracy, if we have been dubious about the rhetoric of union and integration, if we have been half-hearted Europeans, then it follows logically that with part of our hearts, with half our hearts, we feel something else, a sense of love and respect for European culture and civilisation of which we are a part, a desire to cooperate with our friends and partners in everything, creatively, artistically, intellectually.'\n\nThat is the sort of language, and attitude, that Archbishop Welby has been calling for. Along with criticism, he should give the PM some credit. They are, after all, singing from the same hymn sheet.", "description": "DOMINIC LAWSON: As if Boris Johnson didn't have enough critics to contend with, now God has joined their number.
