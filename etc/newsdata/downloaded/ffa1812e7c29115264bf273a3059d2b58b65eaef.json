This 40th-anniversary special edition comes with a modern twist.\n\nAt IFA 2019, an annual technology conference held in Berlin, the company announced the launch of two new devices: the NW-A100TPS and the lower-end NW-A105, both limited-edition Walkmans inspired by the original model.\n\nThe price: 440 euros. (There is currently no U.S. release date for the Walkmans but they will be available in Europe in December. The price point translates to about $489.)\n\n\u201cYou can enjoy the best of both worlds with the heritage design of Walkman whilst having cutting edge technology at your fingertips,\u201d Sony said in a press release. \u201cYou can also enjoy a cassette tape user interface that takes inspiration from classic Walkman models.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach model will run with an Android operating system and have 26 hours of battery life.

It comes in a variety of colors: ash green, black, blue, orange and red.\n\nBoth devices support downloaded and streaming music.\n\nThis revival comes as a number of companies are looking to modernize and bring back, old favorites to tap into consumers' nostalgia.
