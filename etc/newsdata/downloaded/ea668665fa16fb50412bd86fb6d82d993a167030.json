British billionaires Sir David Barclay and Sir Frederick Barclay are identical twin brothers with vast business interests in media, retail and property. Their father died when they were 12, and by the age of 16 they set up a painting and decorating business, before moving into property. In the 1970s, they bought up old boarding houses in London and started turning them into hotels. The brothers moved into media in 1994, buying the European newspaper. They now own the Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator. Sir David's son Aidan has long managed the family's businesses in the UK.\n\n\n\n", "description": "British billionaires Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, 84, are said to be considering selling the Ritz after receiving an offer of \u00a3800 million, equating to \u00a35.8 million per bedroom, for the luxury hotel.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/12/19585996-0-image-a-35_1570794791195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
