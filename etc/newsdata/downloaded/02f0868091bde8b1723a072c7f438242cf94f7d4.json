AP\n\nNowell is one of three players who will return from injury this Saturday to hand England a welcome boost as they prepare to head into the meat of the World Cup. Effectively, England\u2019s last two months could easily have been considered the warm-up phase, as although both Tonga and the United States gave good accounts of themselves, it was always going to be the games with Argentina and France that decided the outcome of Pool C.\n\nTransfer windows don\u2019t exist in rugby union \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 but this must be the closest thing that Jones has felt to signing three new players in one go. \u201cWe have three quality players coming back into the squad,\u201d Jones added.\n\n\u201cJack Nowell \u2013 I know I was criticised for it \u2013 but I believe he could play from six, seven or eight to anywhere in the back line competently. He has amazing fighting spirit. He works so hard for the team. He is just a really good team-man, so he has added to the squad.\u201d\n\nAlongside Nowell on the bench will sit his Exeter teammate, Henry Slade, and Mako Vunipola, the loosehead prop that Jones believes us the \u201cbest in the world\u201d when he is fully fit. The issue now is simply getting him there, having played just 17 minutes of rugby in four-and-a-half months.\n\n\u201cWe put a fair bit of time into our training and know what is needed to play a game,\u201d explained Jones. \u201cWe feel both are right to play. They still have some way to go but they\u2019re in pretty good condition.\n\n\u201cMako is the best loosehead in the world and to have the calmness that he brings, he is a senior counsel for our team. We have got a reasonably young team and Mako has that calmness.\u201d\n\nThe impact of losing Vunipola to injury has been lessened somewhat by the form of Joe Marler and Ellis Genge, with the former retained in the starting XV and the latter harshly yet inevitably axed from the matchday squad. Yet in stark contrast, Mako\u2019s younger brother Billy will be starting his 12th consecutive Test for England, having put his own injury nightmare behind him. It is not the only contrast that Jones sees.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always got two brothers and one\u2019s a bit more volatile, the other is a bit more settled,\u201d he said. \u201cMako was always up at the front with the parents and Billy was in the back, screaming. He\u2019s like that Mako.\n\n\u201cBilly is great for us because he has got that fire and temperament and you want that from your No 8. You look at the history of the World Cups and they\u2019ve always been won by big No 8s.\n\n\u201cYou see it with brothers, there is something about families that distinguishes them from just being friends and I think that carries a lot of weight.\u201d\n\nWith all 31 players now in the mix, perhaps the most impressive thing about Jones\u2019s selection is how predictable it has become. When England won the World Cup in 2003, the squad almost selected itself, such was the way that the names Johnson, Wilkinson, Greenwood and Robinson had established themselves. This is the first time that feeling has returned in 16 unpredictable years.\n\nThe same cannot be said of Saturday\u2019s opponents. Thursday\u2019s team announcement brought with it the surprise decisions from Mario Ledesma to leave Agustin Creevy on the replacements\u2019 bench and axe 77-cap fly-half Nicolas Sanchez from the squad altogether, with Benjamin Urdapilleta retaining the reins at fly-half. After talking up the contest as a \u201cwar\u201d in mid-week, it seems Creevy will be reduced to a by-stander for most of it, unless Ledesma has anything up his sleeve. But having seen this play before, Jones reckons he has Creevy\u2019s game sussed.\n\n\u201cIt is the old two card trick,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnother one of those great old coaches, Bob Dwyer in 1991, threw that one out and there was a response then from the England side. Maybe if they hadn\u2019t played like that they would have two World Cups on their sleeves. There are many different ways to play the game. If I give you a book and you think it is interesting, I can give it to someone else and they think it is rubbish, so what is right?\n\n\u201cNothing is right. Find a way to play the game effectively \u2013 that is the great thing about our game.\n\n\u201cI think we know what we are good at. We have got a clear plan about that a clear thinking of what we are about and most of the time we do that. Like any good batsman you can get seduced by a loose ball outside the off stump every now and then and we are as guilty as anyone. But by and large I think we are pretty disciplined.\u201d\n\nIf England stay disciplined and do exactly what Jones wants, they could find themselves out in front of the pack as the first team cemented into the last eight. Yet if they are seduced into playing the \u201cwar\u201d that Argentina want, it will blow Pool C wide open with France just like how things unfolded in 2015. England know all too painfully that three into two doesn\u2019t go, but with a fully fit squad and a welcome dose of predictability, they can ensure they are not the odd one out again.", "description": "When Jack Nowell was wrenched back over his own leg by Saracens wing Sean Maitland in the Premiership final, it seemed his Rugby World Cup dreams had been dashed yet again.
