The Kurds have no option but to throw themselves into the embrace of President Bashar al-Assad to protect themselves from a Turkish advance that is likely to mean ethnic cleansing for Kurds and has already created 130,000 displaced people.\n\nWhat is doubly sad about this is that Rojava, as the Kurds called their mini-state, was the only part of Syria in which the outcome of the 2011 uprising had produced an improved life for many people \u2013 particularly if you were a Kurd or a woman. In every other part of Syria, Mr Assad\u2019s government and his opponents seemed to vie with each other in their violence and corruption.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The idea is that Syrian soldiers will provide a cordon sanitaire to stop the Turkish advance.\n\nThis would save Kobane, the Kurdish city that Isis besieged and almost captured in 2014-15, at the western end of Rojava and Qamishli, the de facto Kurdish capital, 320 km (200 miles) to the east.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The Kurds could never have permanently held these areas where they were never accepted by the Arabs \u2013 the dislike was mutual.\n\n\u201cThey have always been fascists around here,\u201d volunteered a Kurd to me as we drove into Raqqa last year. The Kurds have lost much but not everything: they still have a powerful army of 25,000 experienced YPG fighters that now presumably shift to the government side. Mr Assad will have to pay some attention to what the Kurds want in terms of autonomy.\n\nIt is the Kurds who will pay the greatest price for President Trump\u2019s decision two weeks ago to publicly abandon his YPG allies \u2013 who lost 11,000 soldiers fighting Isis. But there is also a heavy cost to the US in terms of loss of trust on the part of others who have hitherto relied on Washington to support them. After seeing what happened to the Syrian Kurds, pro-American leaders around the world will wonder if the same thing might happen to them. Unsurprisingly, President Putin is currently receiving a particularly warm welcome on an official visit to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe discrediting of the US as a leader and an ally will have an immediate impact in the Middle East. President Trump was seeking to create a coalition to confront and exert \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran, which he had accused of trying to spread its malign influence throughout the region.\n\nBut the total failure of the US in Syria and the swift and frivolous abandonment of the Kurds makes the Iranians look like reliable friends and determined enemies by comparison. Washington was never going to have a success in Syria, but Mr Trump\u2019s humiliating scuttle maximises the damage to US credibility.\n\nAnd Russia will be a primary beneficiary of the latest events. It stuck by Mr Assad since 2011, became his active military ally in 2015, and, instead of being sucked into the Syrian swamp as many had predicted, emerges on the winning side. This is the greatest Russian political and military success since before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and goes far to re-establish Moscow as a superpower.\n\nRussia is now seeking to re-establish Mr Assad\u2019s authority over most of northeast Syria, while not offending its ally Turkey, close cooperation with which is one of Russia\u2019s gains from the Syrian war. It will most likely succeed: Turkey does not have the military forces to push far into the vast plains of this part of Syria. It has had a big success since its invasion started last week in bringing an end to Rojava, the Kurdish statelet.\n\nAnything more would be complicated and bring diminishing returns. There are flashpoints \u2013 like who will control the Syrian Arab city of Manbij, which has been a vital link between Mr Assad\u2019s territory and the Kurdish held zone \u2013 but Turkey would be overplaying its hand to try to fight the Syrian government as well as the Kurds.\n\nAnother one of Syria\u2019s multiple civil wars has yet to play out: this is the fate of Idlib and the surrounding land, the last bastion of the Syrian armed opposition, where three million people are trapped and are under Syrian government and Russian air and artillery attack. Turkey looks increasingly acquiescent in the gradual extinction of this enclave, so long as its population does not flee across the Turkish border and become refugees in Turkey.\n\nThe Syrian government, Russia and Iran are the main winners and the US and its allies the main losers. Among the latter are Saudi Arabia and the Sunni oil states of the Gulf that played a central role in the Syrian crisis between 2011 and 2015. They were committed to getting rid of Mr Assad and rolling back Iranian influence and failed in both attempts.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s influence in the region is bound to decline because of this indirect failure in Syria, but also because of its lack of success in Yemen and its vulnerability to Iranian-inspired pinprick attacks like the drone assault on its oil facilities on 14 September.\n\nMuch attention is being given to the possible rebirth of Isis and, certainly, the collapse of the US-YPG alliance is good news for its surviving fighters. These will be reinforced by thousands of escaping prisoners and no doubt Isis will have something of a resurgence, but the Sunni Arab communities on which it relies in Syria and Iraq have taken a terrible battering since 2014. They will not want to fight a new war, though Isis will benefit from chaos and, presumably, an end to US airstrikes.\n\nSyria became the arena in which conflicts that have little to do with Syria were fought out. In terms of world politics, President Trump has ensured that the US is emerging as the great loser, not least because his erratic tweets over the last two weeks \u2013 accusing the Kurds of not taking part in the Normandy landings and other weird allegations \u2013 look ever more demented and self-destructive.", "description": "It is the endgame of the eight-year-old Syrian war: the Turkish-Kurd confrontation was the most serious crisis still to be resolved, something that is now happening in the cruellest way possible with the extinction of the statelet that the Syrian Kurds had fought to create since 2011.", "authors": ["Patrick Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/19/us-soldier-armoured-vehicle-syria-turkey-jurds.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
