But the failed transaction is having an impact on at least some companies, namely the company\u2019s country-focused simulacrum like WeWork India.\n\nSubscribe to the Crunchbase Daily\n\nAccording to Reuters, WeWork India \u201chas seen talks with local lender ICICI Bank [\u2026] on $100 million in funding break down since The We Company\u2019s botched stock market launch.\u201d The We Company is the parent company of WeWork, the popular co-working startup.\n\nAccording to Crunchbase data, WeWork India raised a round in January of 2018 from Embassy Group. The same Reuters story notes that the company is looking to raise $200 million more.\n\nWeWork India is not the only WeWork subsidiary, however, that could get hit by the We Company\u2019s IPO fallout. WeWork China may be an even larger bet. Crunchbase notes that the China-focused subsidiary has raised $1 billion across two rounds, each totaling $500 million. The first, raised in 2017, was led by the SoftBank Vision Fund, though it had a number of other participants putting capital to work. WeWork China then raised the second $500 million in mid-2018. Trustbridge Partners co-led that round with the Vision Fund.\n\nThe India and China-focused WeWork efforts aren\u2019t small. Sure, they haven\u2019t raised as much money as the We Company, but I\u2019d hazard each will qualify in the top-decile of all funded companies when all is said and done.\n\nThe wager that we\u2019ve seen regarding the We Company is large, therefore, but not complete. There are other, smaller bets on the company\u2019s model that we can find around the globe. And all dollars in this gambit seem to lead back to SoftBank.\n\nHere\u2019s the We Company discussing its various subsidiaries in its final, pulled S-1/A (Bolding: Crunchbase News):\n\nTo facilitate our expansion into Asia, we formed a number of joint ventures, strategic partnerships and similar entities to drive growth in a capital-efficient manner. We now operate in China, Japan and the broader Pacific region through a series of joint ventures, which we refer to as ChinaCo, JapanCo and PacificCo, respectively. Our key investors in ChinaCo are Softbank, Hony Capital and Trustbridge, and we own 59% of the entity. Our joint venture partner in JapanCo is SoftBank, and we hold a 50% interest in the joint venture. Our key investor in PacificCo is SoftBank, and we own 60% of the entity. We also operate in India through a strategic partnership from which we receive a revenue and profit share. For each of ChinaCo, JapanCo and PacificCo, in addition to our equity interest, we are entitled to a percentage of revenue in exchange for providing certain intellectual property and trademark rights and other services. These strategic relationships have allowed us to expand into new regions without putting our capital at risk.\n\nTerms that generous could only come from an investor committed to the model, I suppose. What matters is that the WeWork IPO mess looks like it could cause more damage. The bad news, for SoftBank shareholders at least, is that the Vision Fund is looking increasingly like AIG if we consider WeWork to be a 2008-era credit default swap.\n\nIllustration: Dom Guzman", "description": "", "authors": ["Alex Wilhelm"], "top_image": "https://news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MMfeature.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
