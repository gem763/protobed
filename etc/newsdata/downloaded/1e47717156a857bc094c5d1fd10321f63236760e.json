The government are the ones who need to act on climate change. We need to focus on whose in power,\" he said.\n\nResources Minister Matt Canavan said Mr Oosting's stance proved two things.\n\n\"One: GetUp is just a front for the Labor Party. Two: Joel isn\u2019t really going to stand up and fight for coal jobs so that\u2019s why the green activists at GetUp don\u2019t see him as a threat,\" he said.\n\nMr Oosting said GetUp spent $3.5 million on its campaign relying largely on small donors, in stark contrast to mining magnate Clive Palmer who splurged $60 million and has claimed credit for helping turn voters against Bill Shorten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There\u2019s simply no level playing field when a Clive Palmer can wash our whole country\u2019s smartphones, laptops, and just about every spare billboard in an icky sea of yellow,\" Mr Oosting said.\n\n\"Essential as donations reforms are, expenditure caps tackle the \u201cdemand-side\u201d of the problem. If politicians can\u2019t spend, they don\u2019t need to raise it. If they don\u2019t need to raise it, wealthy donors and corporates won\u2019t have the power to subvert democracy.\"\n\nMr Morrison hinted earlier this year at holding a fourth inquiry into GetUp's claim it is politically independent and not associated with Labor and the Greens, accusing it of misogyny and bullying against another conservative MP, Nicolle Flint.\n\nBut Mr Oosting said the claims were \"completely without substance\". He said the repeated inquiries into GetUp's bona fides were intended to \"smear, discredit, cast a slur and raise doubt\".", "description": "The left-wing activist group risks claims of hypocrisy because it won't protest against Labor MPs over climate change.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2421%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_49%2C$y_4/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ff7c7c75b645bb55e8f18baae7878b7a8b46377c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
