Despite the slight thaw in previously tetchy relations, the vast majority of BA\u2019s flights taking off from the UK on Monday and Tuesday have already been cancelled.\n\nBA has told passengers that if they have a flight booked on Monday and Tuesday, it is likely they will not be able to travel as planned.\n\nBA operates more than 800 flights a day, with most expected to be cancelled, affecting up to 145,000 passengers each day.\n\nCustomers have been offered refunds or the option to re-book to another date of travel or alternative airline. It is expected that the problems will continue after the strike, because planes and pilots will need to be in position for subsequent journeys.\n\nBalpa\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: \u201cBritish Airways needs to wake up and realise its pilots are determined to be heard.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve previously taken big pay cuts to help the company through hard times. Now BA is making billions of pounds of profit, its pilots have made a fair, reasonable and affordable claim for pay and benefits.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s leaders, who themselves are paid huge salaries and have generous benefits packages, won\u2019t listen, are refusing to negotiate and are putting profits before the needs of passengers and staff. It is time to get back to the negotiating table and put together a serious offer that will end this dispute,\u201d he said.\n\nBA has offered an 11.5% pay rise over three years, which it said would take the pay of some captains to more than \u00a3200,000 a year.\n\nThe airline said it believed the pay offer was \u201cfair and generous\u201d, and that it if it was good enough for BA cabin crew, ground staff and engineers \u2013 whose unions, Unite and the GMB, have both accepted it \u2013 it should be good enough for pilots.\n\nA Balpa statement said: \u201cFundamentally, BA pilots have lost trust and confidence in their management through relentless cost and corner-cutting.\u201d\n\nOne pilot told the Guardian on Friday: \u201cIt\u2019s not really about money, it\u2019s about respect. We\u2019ve effectively been lied to. We\u2019ve given up a serious pension scheme, pay and pay rises when the company was weak \u2013 all on the promise that when the company was strong and giving up proper returns to its investors, we would benefit.\u201d\n\n\u00c1lex Cruz, the company\u2019s chief executive, is currently paid \u00a31.3m. In August BA\u2019s parent firm, IAG, reported a 20% rise in its pre-tax second-quarter profit. In 2018 it reported annual profits of \u20ac2.9bn (\u00a32.6bn).\n\nThe strike is the latest blow for passengers at an airline that once called itself the \u201cworld\u2019s favourite\u201d but has looked increasingly accident-prone.\n\nThe fragility of BA\u2019s IT security was laid bare last year when hackers stole the personal data of half a million customers, a breach that led to a \u00a3183m fine.\n\nIn July a computer systems glitch meant that more than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed, causing problems for tens of thousands of passengers. In 2017 a power cut left 75,000 passengers stranded. Pilots and crew said they were left to deal with the fallout, which went on for several days.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has said passengers have a legal right to a replacement flight at BA\u2019s expense to get them to their destination, even if this means travelling with a different airline.", "description": "Balpa union calls 48-hour walkout with further action planned for 27 September", "authors": ["Miles Brignall"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145129cd376664fb04824090e06af2a01c7b3ec3/0_298_2872_1724/master/2872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a42436903b46a75243594a649f9047a0", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
