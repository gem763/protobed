In the video, the president is superimposed into a murder scene from the 2014 film, \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d The clip shows a fake brutally murdering his political rivals and members of the media at the \u201cChurch of Fake News.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe New York Times was the first to report that the video was shown at an American Priority conference for Trump supporters in Miami. The video used the logo for Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg referenced the controversial Kathy Griffin incident from two years ago, when the comedian posted a video of her holding a mask that imitated the severed head of Trump, as an example of free speech crossing the line.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t think this is okay, that has to be the position you come from,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cYou can be a conservative and say, \u2018This is never okay.\u2019 This is about human connection. We don\u2019t want anyone thinking this is a good idea. That\u2019s why people came down so hard on Kathy Griffin. That\u2019s why people came down so hard on all the other iterations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been his MO,\u201d Goldberg continued. \u201cHe has said it\u2019s okay. Either we stand up for it, or we let it happen.\u201d\n\nMeghan McCain, who already condemned the video on Twitter, further emphasized how difficult the situation was with her family continuing to be dragged into these types of controversies.\n\n\u201cHow easy for all of you judging me that I\u2019m offended and upset by the video,\u201d McCain said. \u201cYou try doing this when it\u2019s a member of your family [who] continues to have this happen to them over and over and over again. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter to anyone in Trump world whatsoever. You conservatives on Twitter, if this were the opposite and it happened with Obama, you\u2019d be screaming bloody murder.\u201d\n\nAbby Huntsman declared that Trump must take responsibility for the video.\n\n\u201cIt starts at the top,\u201d Hunstman said. \u201cHe may not have seen this video or known, but someone approved this video to be seen [at the conference]. You can\u2019t just put the video on your iPhone and have it show on a projector.\u201d\n\nSunny Hostin questioned the purpose of the video, and wondered if it would lead to more violence.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that tend to incite violence against these particular people?\u201d Hostin asked.\n\nMcCain agreed, saying: \u201cBy the way, Steve Scalise was shot by someone, by a complete, radical, crazy person and almost died. This does happen.\u201d\n\n'Morning Joe' host Joe Scarborough slams Trump: 'He is not mentally fit to be president':\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "\"The View\" hosts were shocked and disturbed by the doctored Donald Trump massacre video that was shown at a Trump rally in Florida.", "authors": ["Arjuna Ramgopal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pQnFXx9i.3EkQzYmH4ajuQ--~B/aD05NzI7dz0xNDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/df1dce60-eeb3-11e9-bfec-c667bef9a370", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
