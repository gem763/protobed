Tompkins tweeted, \u201c#RIP Their old tweets.\u201d\n\nThe show is bringing on board Groundling performer Chloe Fineman, current writer Bowen Yang\u2014who will become the first East Asian cast member in the show\u2019s history\u2014and a stand-up comedian from Philadelphia named Shane Gillis.\n\nTurns out it was Gillis who had reason to be concerned about his \u201cproblematic\u201d history.\n\nHe was apparently worried enough to delete all of the videos from his podcast\u2019s YouTube channel and all but the most recent episodes from the internet. But that wasn\u2019t before a journalist named Seth Simons posted a clip from a September 2018 episode of Matt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast, which Gillis co-hosts with fellow comic Matt McCusker.\n\nIn the clip, Gillis says, \u201cDamn, Chinatown is fucking nuts,\u201d before adding, \u201cLet the fucking chinks live there.\u201d Throughout the rest of the short clip, both Gillis and McCusker comically imitate stereotypical Asian accents as they complain about the \u201cdishonest\u201d nature of MSG and the \u201cfucking hassle\u201d of ordering food from someone who doesn\u2019t speak English well.\n\nIn another clip from the same podcast episode, the pair spend time arguing that not only white people can be racist before McCusker says he thinks South East Asian women \u201ctake the cake\u201d in terms of looks. \u201cYou like ladyboys?\u201d Gillis asks in response.\n\nIn another podcast clip from earlier this year uncovered by Vulture\u2019s Megh Wright, the pair can be heard using homophobic slurs to mock comedians like Judd Apatow and Chris Gethard, calling them \u201cwhite f*ggot comics\u201d and \u201cfucking gayer than ISIS.\u201d\n\nThey also spend time arguing that men are funnier than women, ranking comedians by race, gender and sexual orientation. \u201cWhite chicks are literally the bottom,\u201d Gillis says, adding, \u201cAli Wong is making it so Asian chicks are funnier than white chicks.\u201d Wright quotes the owner of a Philadelphia comedy club owner who says the theater \u201cstopped working with [Gillis] within the past few years because of racist, homophobic, and sexist things he\u2019s said on and offstage.\u201d\n\nA representative from Saturday Night Live was not immediately available for comment.\n\nGillis\u2019 comments already appear to be outraging people on Twitter. In one tweet, CNN opinion writer Jeff Yang wrote, \u201cYeah if you want to know what being a person of color is like, it\u2019s literally that for every Bowen Yang-shaped step you take forward, you also take one racist-ass Shane Gillis-shaped step back.\u201d\n\nStephanie Foo, a producer for This American Life, added, \u201cThis is the most racist thing I\u2019ve heard against Chinese people in a long damn while. Why on earth would you say this in public? Let\u2019s make him fucking regret this.\u201d\n\nComedians, who are often hesitant to criticize the jokes of other comics, also shared their disappointment in the hire.\n\nKorean-American comedy writer Daniel Chun, who has written for both The Simpsons and The Office, responded by saying, \u201cThis is stupid and racist, but at least it\u2019s also unfunny.\u201d\n\nComedian and actress Jen Kwok tweeted, \u201cIf you don\u2019t think racism exists and is a problem on every level, here is a video of two white guys having a casual conversation in which they make fun of Chinese people for two minutes straight. As comedy. In 2018.\u201d\n\nLao comedian, podcaster and showrunner Kulap Vilaysack, simply wrote, \u201cThis makes me very mad.\u201d\n\nAnd Padma Lakshmi said, \u201cBesides being incredibly racist, it\u2019s also just not funny. Is this the White Privilege Podcast Hour or what?\u201d\n\nBut there is another contingent of comedy fans who are holding him up as an avatar of anti-woke, politically-incorrect comedy that has mostly been represented on SNL of late by \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor Michael Che.\n\nLike Che before him, Gillis also defended comedian Louis C.K. in an interview with PhiladelphiaNeighborhoods.com last year. \u201cIt\u2019s not like stand-ups were looked at as great members of society before all this stuff happened,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think anything is affected. What? Just because Louis got caught\u2026 No, that\u2019s changed nothing. He\u2019s still the best.\u201d\n\nIn another interview from 2016, Gillis spoke specifically about trying to \u201cfind the line\u201d in comedy.\n\n\u201cYou could make a fucking terrorist joke. ISIS joke. Anything else got laughs. But police brutality\u2014 the white people were like, \u2018Don\u2019t do that. Please don\u2019t do that.\u2019 That\u2019s interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou throw stuff out there and you get to see them react to things, like yea or nay, what\u2019s funny and what\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be racist to Asians. That\u2019s what we\u2019re finding out,\u201d Gillis added. \u201cIt\u2019s just blatant hypocrisy though.\u201d\n\nNow, the question remains, will Lorne Michaels and SNL stand by their decision to cast Gillis? Or will they take Twitter\u2019s suggestion and cancel him?", "description": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d hired a white comedian who enjoys cracking racist jokes about Asians on the same day the show announced it was adding its first-ever East Asian cast member.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_621,w_1104,x_111,y_221/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568334780/unnamed_5_us6ebr", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
