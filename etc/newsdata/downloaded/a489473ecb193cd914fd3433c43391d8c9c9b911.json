On Daryl Morey, he was the one who was \u2018misinformed.\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with James feeling the players and teams visiting China last week were put in a difficult position after Morey, the Houston Rockets general manager, posted a tweet supporting pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. Free speech is always wonderful for the individual, but complicated for any group he represents. As the biggest star in the NBA, James made a useful point when he called for a \u201cconsideration for the consequences and ramifications\u201d before making a powerful statement that affects the entire league.\n\nJames should have kept his message that simple and focused. But self-importance got the best of him. When speaking to reporters for the first time Monday night about the China fiasco, James ventured into territory so dangerous that he damaged his sterling reputation as an enlightened icon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe accused Morey of being \u201cmisinformed or not really educated on the situation.\u201d He spent way too much time bellyaching about players having \u201cbusiness to take care of while they were over there\u201d and how those potential money-making appearances were canceled. Worst of all, he used the same kind of loaded language about Morey\u2019s \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong\u201d tweet that others resort to when dismissing the protests of domestic social concerns that matter to him.\n\nJames harped on the timing of Morey\u2019s tweet, which would have been fine if his tone hadn\u2019t been so callous. The Los Angeles Lakers star even took to Twitter after his media session and grumbled that Morey, \u201cCould have waited a week to send it.\u201d The NBA would have been done playing exhibition games in China. The backlash still would have been intense, but NBA employees wouldn\u2019t have had to face it in person. There is a delicate way to say that, but James sounded like an NFL fan crying about players kneeling and making demonstrations during the national anthem.\n\nProtest some other time. Protest somewhere else. Those are always the suggestions of people who care nothing about your societal concerns. Misinformed? That is code for, \u201cWe hope to make your compassion seem like overly emotional idiocy.\u201d Consequences and ramifications? In James\u2019s tone, it can be taken to sound suspiciously like, \u201cStop messing with my money.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI don\u2019t believe that was his intention. It seems that James simply wanted to stand up for the players and criticize Morey \u2014 who tweeted, clarified and wisely disappeared from the public eye \u2014 for blindsiding them with controversy and forcing them into a situation in which they were expected to take a stand on an unfamiliar issue. Because the NBA canceled player media availabilities in China, James had more than a week to organize his thoughts. He even could have run them by public relations officials for insight on how his remarks would be received. But when he spoke, he was more graceless, impulsive and ignorant than he ever has been.\n\nHe needed to keep his message tidy and succinct. He should have copied how NBA Commissioner Adam Silver chose to frame the large and divisive geopolitical dispute as simply an issue of freedom of speech for Morey and the league. While many criticized Silver for not openly supporting Hong Kong\u2019s fight to protect its human rights, he did his job \u2014 at least as the commissioner of a multibillion-dollar business financially wedded to the Chinese market \u2014 in trying to balance the rights of NBA employees with a lucrative partnership. The Chinese government wanted Silver to punish Morey for questioning its totalitarian ways. Ultimately, after trying to massage the situation, Silver said no because that is not the NBA \u2014 or the American \u2014 way. Silver won\u2019t win humanitarian of the year for caring only about his league, but it\u2019s na\u00efve to think he would handle this particular matter in any other way.\n\nAn uncomfortable fact of life: It takes a shameful amount of personal hypocrisy and willful negligence for all of us to get through each day. Even those blessed with great morality tolerate, if not contribute to, immoral behavior. Clearly, James lives too far from Hong Kong to be moved by protestors taking a stand, at great risk, to protect their diminishing freedom. Clearly, considering how this controversy stunned most American NBA fans, this human rights struggle isn\u2019t an issue high on our priority lists, either. In an ideal world, that\u2019s not okay. In a realistic one, that\u2019s life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor James, the problem is that he has made human compassion a significant part of his brand. He grew up admiring Muhammad Ali, and in his own way, he has used the Ali model to transcend sports in a responsible manner. He has used his voice to support Black Lives Matter, to denounce gun violence and to call President Trump a \u201cbum\u201d for the way he treats people. He has challenged the NCAA on its financial exploitation of college athletes. A year ago, he opened a school to turn around the lives of some of Akron\u2019s most at-risk children. Most of the time, you can depend on James to be a thoughtful and impassioned public figure, the quintessential athlete icon.\n\nBut this time? James, whose net worth has been estimated as high as $450 million, acted like the person of privilege that he has become. He was so lost on this issue that even his Twitter clarification missed the mark.\n\n\u201cLet me clear up the confusion,\u201d James wrote. \u201cI do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to go after Morey, to call him misinformed, without addressing the substance. James could have avoided this mess by saying, \u201cI respect Morey\u2019s concerns about Hong Kong and his right to express himself, but I wish he would have found a way to avoid putting the rest of us in such an awkward situation. I don\u2019t think he realized how strong the backlash was going to be.\u201d\n\nLike Silver, James wouldn\u2019t have won any awards for focusing on his interests. But it\u2019s a lot better to be considered self-absorbed than narrow-minded. For a superstar who has enhanced his career with his \u201cMore Than An Athlete\u201d proclamations, James failed to live up to his own standard.\n\nHe thought he could shame a rival general manager for causing him a few days of discomfort without adding anything worthwhile to the larger debate. He thought his temporary strife actually mattered. It was an arrogant error that stamped James with the same label he tried to attach to Morey: misinformed.\n\nAD", "description": "NBA\u2019s biggest star succumbed to self-importance when speaking on Houston GM\u2019s Hong Kong tweets.", "authors": ["Jerry Brewer", "Sports Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SJOMgSK3hLyLzvztfv-ZGsoz3sM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3DDAMHHPSAI6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
