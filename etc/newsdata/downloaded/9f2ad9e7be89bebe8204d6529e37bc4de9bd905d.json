B\u00e9lidor said this season was programmed by her predecessor, but she'll be choosing the works to display next year. (Elysha Enos/CBC)\n\nShe worked as a waitress during the breakfast rush during her undergrad in art history at Concordia.\n\nTo those starving young artists tempted to double-down on creative work in the hopes of finding success faster, B\u00e9lidor advises patience.\n\n\"Never underestimate the power of a job that is just made to nourish you,\" she says.\n\n\"Just having a roof over your head and food on your table allows you not to have to live precariously \u2014 it allows you to focus on your practice.\"\n\nFinding a role model in Toronto\n\nBut things got more complicated for B\u00e9lidor when she decided to get a master's degree in Toronto.\n\nUnable to live at home, her choice of school became largely determined by which would provide her with funding.\n\nShe combined a stipend with bursaries and student loans \u2014 which she's still paying off.\n\nB\u00e9lidor also took an internship at Toronto's Power Plant Gallery, where she had the chance to get her bearings in the art world under the tutelage of another Concordia alumnus, Ga\u00ebtane Verna.\n\nThrough Verna, she learned first-hand how to navigate the art world, \"because it's not very easy for a black woman to do,\" she says.\n\nNow that she's more established, the challenges she soldiered through earlier in her life have become more mature, polished ones.\n\nShe says that many women and racialized artists are used to being underpaid, or not paid at all, for their work.\n\nBut, isn't exposure valuable?\n\n\"Learn to say 'no,\" she says. \"Exposure doesn't pay rent.\"\n\nDon't be too shy to talk about money\n\nB\u00e9lidor advises artists to always ask about payment when it comes to being invited to speak at events or showcase their work.\n\nIn her experience, being invited to participate in a panel discussion on being a racialized person in the arts \u2014 a triggering discussion to have \u2013 might not result in compensation. Meanwhile, other speakers will receive it.\n\nShe says artists shouldn't be shy to ask who else is participating in a given event and whether or not they are being paid for their time.\n\nNow 32, B\u00e9lidor is older and wiser. She considers herself fluent and more at ease navigating the pitfalls that stem from other people's projections of what she should be willing to accept.\n\nThe final frontier for the young gallery director is now imposter syndrome.\n\n\"There's always this feeling that I'm not really the best person for the position, but I am excited to do it,\" B\u00e9lidor says.\n\nAnd when she goes home to visit her family now, she doesn't have to feel like the odd one out next to her sisters who studied engineering and early childhood education.\n\n\"My parents see that it's working,\" she says of her career in the arts.\n\nHer youngest sister is still in high school and B\u00e9lidor's is happy to see her parents now trust that she'll find her way in whatever she does.\n\n\"She will be able to do whatever she wants,\" she says.", "description": "Eunice B\u00e9lidor's success in the art world broke the mould.
