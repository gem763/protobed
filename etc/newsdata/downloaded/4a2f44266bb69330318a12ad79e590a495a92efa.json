The Jets have a game at New England in Week 3 before they have a bye-week break, and then games at Philadelphia, at home against Dallas and New England before a road game at Jacksonville on Oct. 27 to cap a rough opening stretch.\n\nWhen a reporter pointed out that mono usually take several weeks from which to heal, Gase nodded.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m aware,\u201d Gase said. \u201cGood thing we\u2019ve got the early bye week.\u201d\n\nDarnold was sent home by the team Wednesday with what Gase said was \u201cstrep throat or something.\u201d Team doctors later told Gase that antibiotics weren\u2019t working as quickly as expected, leading to the diagnosis.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going through some of these tests to kind of see where he\u2019s at with all this,\u201d Gase said. \u201cI know he\u2019s out this week. Then, past that, I\u2019ll have more information as we go.\u201d\n\nGase said he, offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains and athletic trainer Dave Zuffelato went to Darnold\u2019s home to deliver the news to the quarterback and he took it \u201cnot well,\u201d according to the coach.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t real happy about it,\u201d Gase said. \u201cAll three of us went over there and he knew something was up when Dowell and myself showed up. I just wanted to make sure it was delivered right, and I figured I could be the bearer of bad news on this one.\u201d\n\nThe coach says Darnold\u2019s biggest concern is weight loss. Gase adds Darnold has already lost about 5 pounds.\n\n\u201cThat was something that was alarming to him, that he lost weight already in the last couple of days,\u201d Gase said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be in the building right now, so he\u2019s like, \u2018I need to get meals over here, I need to make sure that I\u2019m getting enough of what I need to keep my weight.\u2019 I mean, he went right into, all right, how do I maintain?\u201d\n\nGase said Luke Falk will be promoted from the practice squad to serve as Siemian\u2019s backup. The Jets could also look to sign an experienced quarterback for depth.\n\nBut, for now - and probably the next handful of games - it will be Siemian leading New York\u2019s offense.\n\nSiemian was signed as a free agent in the offseason after spending last season with Minnesota. The 27-year-old quarterback played in Denver his first three NFL seasons, and is 13-11 as a starter. He has thrown 5,686 yards and 30 touchdowns with 24 interceptions.\n\nGase said the Jets\u2018 approach on offense won\u2019t change much with Siemian taking over for Darnold.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Trevor\u2019s here,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe signed Trevor specifically because he has 24 starts over his career with a winning record, has a lot of experience, has been on winning ballclubs. He has the respect of the locker room.\n\n\u201cI think the reaction I got and the way that guys looked, it was like: \u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019 There was confidence there.\u201d\n\nThe injury news wasn\u2019t limited to Darnold.\n\nNearly overshadowed in the stunning news about the quarterback was Gase announcing that running back Le\u2019Veon Bell would be among the players sitting out of practice because of a sore shoulder.\n\nBell was solid in his Jets debut last Sunday, his first game in nearly 20 months after sitting out in a contract dispute with Pittsburgh. But, there\u2019s a chance Bell could also miss the game against the Browns. He was having an MRI later in the day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting to find out the extent of this,\u201d Gase said. \u201cThis could be just soreness. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything worse than that, but we\u2019re just kind of probably being a little extra cautious.\u201d\n\nWide receiver Demaryius Thomas also sat out after joining the team Wednesday following a trade from New England. The Jets are hoping Thomas will be able to practice Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a hamstring (ailment) for a while,\u201d Gase said. \u201cWe knew that. He\u2019s close.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Thomas would have to practice Saturday to be able to play Monday night, Gase smiled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of bodies.\u201d\n\nLinebacker C.J. Mosley (groin) and defensive tackle Quinnen Williams (ankle) remained sidelined, and defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers (foot) sat out Thursday. One piece of good news for the Jets: safety Jamal Adams was back after sitting out Wednesday with soreness in his hip and back.\n\nGase said the team\u2019s approach in adversity begins with him, as well as general manager Joe Douglas, owner Christopher Johnson and team president Hymie Elhai.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s our attitude going to be? Is it going to be woe is me? The sky is falling?\u201d Gase said. \u201cOr, is it, this is a challenge we\u2019re going to embrace? And, guys just getting tighter in the locker room and everybody coming together and doing their job as well as they can to help us win.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to look back and this is going to be a good thing for us. I think it\u2019s going to bring that locker room even tighter.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Sam Darnold is sick and sidelined - likely for several weeks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Waszak Jr."], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/Bills_Jets_Football_61575.jpg-55c14_c0-206-4915-3071_s1770x1032.jpg?e89b5b4fc8bb685c248cdbde5b2658e90530c231"}
