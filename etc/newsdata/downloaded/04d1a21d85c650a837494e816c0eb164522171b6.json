The measure is aimed at putting into law a state court ruling last year involving package-delivery workers.\n\nThe bill is aimed at big tech companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., but experts say it would go beyond those businesses to affect industries like trucking that use contract workers.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAlthough many U.S. trucking companies hire their own company drivers, most also rely heavily on independent drivers that own or lease their equipment to supplement their operations. The independent owner-operator model is especially prevalent in port trucking operations, where companies say drivers have the ability to make more money than they might as employees.\n\nThe California measure \u201ceffectively prohibits an owner-operator from working directly for a motor carrier,\u201d said Joe Rajkovacz, director of governmental affairs and communications for the Western States Trucking Association.\n\nThe group filed a federal lawsuit challenging California\u2019s application of the standard from the 2018 court case to the trucking industry. The group\u2019s suit was dismissed earlier this year. The law \u201cwill really cause people to look at how they structure their business,\u201d Mr. Rajkovacz said.\n\nUnder the employment legislation, certain industries including most trucking operations would have to pass a three-part test to classify a worker as a contractor instead of an employee, including that the work a contractor performs isn\u2019t something the company does itself in the normal course of its business.\n\nThat standard is tougher than previous requirements and is one that transportation experts say would be difficult to meet for the many motor carriers that routinely contract freight out to independent truckers.\n\nRaising the bar for using contract drivers \u201ctakes some of the nimble reaction to the freight market away from the trucking industry, [especially] in California where you have large port operations with a lot of freight coming in, and large volumes around Christmas,\u201d said Greg Feary, president and managing partner of transportation law firm Scopelitis, Garvin, Light, Hanson & Feary, PC.\n\n\u201cYou would like to think the freight will get moved,\u201d Mr. Feary said, \u201cbut will the prices increase for the shippers and then the consumer? Will freight sit for a while? Will delivery times extend?\u201d\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has said he would sign the measure, which is backed by labor groups including the Teamsters union. The Teamsters have waged a yearslong campaign to organize California port truck drivers who they say are unfairly misclassified as independent contractors and so deprived of workers compensation, meal and rest breaks and other protections.\n\n\u201cMisclassification is an attempt to weaken the power of workers, including the thousands of truck drivers in California who deserve a living wage and full rights as employees,\u201d Teamsters General President Jim Hoffa said in a statement after the state Senate passed the measure.\n\nNFI Industries, a New Jersey-based logistics provider that has California port-trucking operations targeted by the Teamsters and faces lawsuits filed by the City of Los Angeles over alleged employee misclassification, said the bill would force independent drivers to be employees against their will. The company said the legislation unfairly exempts some groups but not others.\n\nThe California Trucking Association, which sought unsuccessfully to carve out exemptions in the bill for trucking, said the measure \u201cwould deny a significant segment of the trucking industry\u201d that have invested tens of thousands of dollars in equipment \u201cthe ability to continue operating as independent owner-operators.\u201d\n\nThe group estimates there are roughly 70,000 owner-operators in the state.\n\nFrom the Archives For an increasing number of Americans, a patchwork of gig work is the norm, while others have become so-called independent workers because they take second jobs through digital platforms like Uber or Etsy to make ends meet. But nearly all face the challenges of inconsistent income and access to benefits.
