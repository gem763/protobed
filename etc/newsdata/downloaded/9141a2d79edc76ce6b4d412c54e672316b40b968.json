It\u2019s the U.S.\u2019s turn to finally get in on the folding phone fun after Samsung delayed its initial launch to address concerns regarding its durability.\n\nAt launch, the $US1,980 ($2,924) Galaxy Fold will be available as a carrier-branded phone from AT&T, or as an unlocked model available at Best Buy and Samsung retail stores that will work on any of the other major U.S. cell networks. However, unlike the UK and South Korea which got both 4G and 5G versions of the Galaxy Fold, at least initially, only the 4G Galaxy Fold will be available in the U.S.\n\nThe two main updates Samsung made to the Fold for its re-launch were moving the protective polymer film that sits on top of the phone\u2019s flexible OLED display beneath its bezels so that no one would mistake it for a screen protector and try to remove it, and the addition of a T-shaped insert designed to prevent debris from getting inside the Fold\u2019s hinge.\n\nSamsung\u2019s new insert for the Galaxy Fold\u2019s hinge is an improvement, but still not a perfect fix.

Fold owners will be able to use to service to get a walk through and explanation of the Galaxy Fold\u2019s various features, or to contact Samsung about any potential issues via video chat, in-person support, or a dedicated phone number.\n\nUnfortunately, as YouTube channel JerryRigEverything demonstrated recently after pouring some sand and rocks on the phone, the thing still won\u2019t win many durability contests. Because the Galaxy Fold doesn\u2019t have an official IP rating for dust or water resistance, it\u2019s still quite possible for small particles to find their way inside Samsung\u2019s foldable phone.\n\nOn the bright side, the Fold\u2019s hinge should be able to withstand a huge amount of pressure, because despite Zach from JerryRigEverything pushing directly on its hinge, he wasn\u2019t able to bend of break the phone like he did on a couple previous iPhones and iPads.\n\nAs for the Galaxy Fold\u2019s main rival \u2014 the Huawei Mate X \u2014 it\u2019s expected by the end of the year. While Huawei still hasn\u2019t announced an official sale date for its foldable phone, Huawei consumer group CEO Richard Yu said, during its recent launch event for the Mate 30 and Mate 30 Pro, that the Mate X could be available as early as next month.\n\nHuawei Mate X, A Foldable Phone, Is Coming To Australia Technology has made a lot of strange and downright wacky devices a reality and foldable smartphones fit neatly into that thinking. Introducing the Mate X, which is Huawei's version of a smartphone you can bend into your pocket \u2013 and Huawei Australia confirmed it will be available in Australia this year. Read more\n\nEither way, while the Galaxy Fold is certainly an ambitious and impressive device, for anyone interested in a foldable phone but concerned about its durability or longevity, my advice would be to wait for the second or third generation of folding devices.\n\nThe Galaxy Fold is an all-new type of smartphone experience, but as with all first-gen devices, there\u2019s still some growing pains that Samsung and others should be able to address more thoroughly on subsequent versions.\n\nEditor's Note: Australians will have to wait a little bit longer to get their hands on the Galaxy Fold.", "description": "Samsung has announced that the Samsung Galaxy Fold officially goes back on sale in the U.S. on September 28.
