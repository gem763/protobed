The law only compels the PM to seek an extension if MPs fail to pass a motion.\n\nSir Oliver told MPs: \"That will enable those of us, like me, who wish to support and carry through and eventually see the ratification of this deal, not to put us in the position of allowing the government off the Benn Act hook on Saturday, but only at a time when the bill has been taken through both Houses of Parliament and legislated on.\"\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons leader, said Mr Johnson would make a statement at 9.30am on Saturday and take questions about his talks with the EU.\n\nHe suggested MPs would be offered the chance to either approve a deal or approve a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Brexiteer said he would support the plan, as the prime minister deserved credit for his \"remarkable success in a deal that all of us can support\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
