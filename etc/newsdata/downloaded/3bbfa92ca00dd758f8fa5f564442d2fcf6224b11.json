At the time of his conviction, stemming from the 1992 death of 22-year-old Donnivan Schaeffer, South Dakota required the use of an ultra-fast-acting drug alongside a paralysing agent \u2014 which Pentobarbital is not.\n\n\u201cThe issue is should the state follow its law when attempting to carry out the death penalty, and the obvious answer to that is yes, because we\u2019re talking about a process that is kind of the ultimate exercise of state power,\u201d Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Centre, told The Independent.\n\nPentobarbital is approved for use in executions in several US states, including Texas and Missouri, as well as in executions conducted by the federal government under a policy reversal implemented by the Trump administration.\n\nBut, as the drug has been criticised for the potential pain it might bring to those being executed \u2014 South Dakota inmate Rodney Berget, for instance, infamously asked \u201cis it supposed to feel like that?\u201d during his 12 minute execution last year \u2014 the question about the source of the drug has also proved elusive.\n\nMr Dunham said that there are no manufactures in the United States that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that have approved the sale of pentobarbital to states for use in executions. That means that states like South Dakota \u2014 which have refused to disclose the source of their execution drugs \u2014 and others could potentially be using drugs that are old, or even improperly stored.\n\n\u201cTheir policy is that it is a state secret,\u201d Mr Dunham said. \u201cIt reminds me of a caution from president [Ronald] Regan, about how the scariest thing in the world is somebody coming up to you and saying, \u2018trust me, I\u2019m the government.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201c\u2018Trust me I\u2019m the government followed by, \u2018I\u2019m not going to tell you that\u2019 suggests there is something to hide.\u201d\n\nIn the court filing, Rhines and his lawyers have also asked for disclosure of the source of drugs that could be used in his execution. The state is unlikely to provide that information.\n\nSouth Dakota assistant attorney general Paul Swedlund said in an October letter that the state Department of Corrections would not disclose the source of the drugs, but said that no drug would be used that had passed its expiration date.\n\n\u201cObviously, drugs used in the United States must be produced in an FDA-approved facility,\u201d Mr Swedlund wrote.\n\nMr Swedlund has not responded to the recent filing on behalf of Rhines.\n\nRead more\n\nDeath for \u2018Boy Next Door Killer\u2019 who killed Ashton Kutcher's date\n\nUganda announces \u2018Kill the Gays\u2019 law\n\n'Hollywood Ripper' convicted of murdering Ashton Kutcher's date\n\nSister Helen Prejean: the most famous death-penalty abolitionist nun", "description": "A South Dakota man on death row is petitioning the state to use a lethal injection drug of his choosing, just two weeks from his planned execution date.Charles Russell Rhines has asked the state to use the same type of drug that was mandated for executions at the time of his conviction, which occurred", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cY.lz5AeNi7YgH2NEC5tug--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/8007b6bd9fd2c0c318cc36fa13339824", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
