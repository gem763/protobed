It's a fact I don't tell people very often these days, but when I do, I still feel the need to follow it up with lengthy disclaimers: It was a day school in industrial Coventry, not Eton... I was on a part scholarship so my parents were hardly wiring in the money from some sort of tax-haven located mansion... I went to a normal primary school... sense of entitlement sold separately, etc, etc.\n\nUltimately, I add these caveats because I\u2019ve come to feel guilty about this privileged start in life. It doesn\u2019t matter that my parents came from working class backgrounds, or that they sacrificed a great deal to send me to a fee-paying school. It doesn\u2019t matter that I understand why they made that choice \u2013 it doesn\u2019t even matter that I understand why many parents still make that choice, desperate to give their children the very best start in life.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter because however valid the reasons, however motivated by love, my parents\u2019 decision had the desired effect. It would be utterly disingenuous for me to pretend it didn\u2019t benefit me \u2013 that in some ways it doesn\u2019t still benefit me. But it would be equally disingenuous for me to pretend my school \u2013 and others like it \u2013 don\u2019t hurt society and promote inequality.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt's why I have strong feelings about the news that Labour seeks to abolish private schools if it comes to power. Perhaps because of my ambivalence towards my own educational backstory, it's a principle I'd support wholeheartedly \u2013 not because I want to tear down schools that frequently do an excellent job, but because I want all children to benefit from them.\n\nIf we\u2019re honest, we all know that change is swiftest and most effective when those with money and influence are pushing for it. At the moment, there\u2019s simply not enough impetus to improve state schools because the rich and powerful have an opt-out clause \u2013 the opportunity to siphon off their children into enclaves of small class sizes and specialist facilities.\n\nNot only this, but at a point where children and young people might be particularly receptive to learning from people different to them, we cut them off from one of their key chances to actually do this. I can argue that there was some range of social backgrounds and classes at my school but realistically this was a tiny slice of society as a whole. Private schools draw visible and defined boundaries between people. And they allow those already born ahead in the stakes of influence and support to race even further to the front of the queue as they mingle with other people with power, continuing the cycle.\n\nIronically, it's often the right that talk about the importance of meritocracy \u2013 mostly when arguing against skewed shortlists to try to increase representation of minority groups. But this idea of true meritocracy is laughable as long as parents with money can pay for advantage. Forty-two per cent of Oxbridge places still go to pupils from private schools, and in 2017, the Sutton Trust found 29 per cent of MPs were privately-educated. Unless we are arguing that those who are privately educated are somehow coincidentally simply the best candidates for these positions, then we have to accept the simple, raw injustice of these figures.\n\nBut most strangely of all, I sometimes think that some of those who run or graduate from private schools are particularly susceptible to the idea that maybe they simply are the best.\n\nMy experience of private schools is that not only do they promote that sense of entitlement \u2013 \u201cI deserve to go to the best school, the best university, I deserve to get the highest paying job\u201d \u2013 they actively reward it. There\u2019s a brash, indestructible confidence in some private school alumni that says if you want something enough, then you can have it. It\u2019s no wonder that it sometimes gives people permission to ignore the barriers that exist when you haven\u2019t had the same advantages. It\u2019s not so much of a leap from here to \u201cpoor people are poor because they just don\u2019t try hard enough.\u201d\n\nLook \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to disavow my own past. Nor do I wish to denigrate the many wonderful and caring staff that surely still work at private schools across the country. It\u2019s not about trying to drag all schools down to the lowest common denominator, quite the opposite, in fact. Because if we can agree that many private schools do provide a standard of education that allows students to fulfill their potential, then surely we can also agree that all children deserve access to this.\n\nA two-tier system that tips the playing field will never lead to true equality of opportunity.", "description": "I was once a privately educated school girl.
