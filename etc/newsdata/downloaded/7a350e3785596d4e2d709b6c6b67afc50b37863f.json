He thanked everyone, said he was exhausted from trying and no longer wished to.\n\nI soon learnt that people in families, schools and workplaces are battling mental health issues behind closed doors. It is a national crisis.\n\nIf a lack of mental health and wellbeing is unique to an individual or genetic, why is it that, at our most advanced phase in human development, there is an exponential increase in mental illnesses?\n\nI have discovered that mental health and wellbeing is something more than we currently define, distort, dismiss or know \u2013 it is subtle and delicate.\n\nIt is in the quality of our human connections, the environment and our collective safety and trust, not just in ourselves, but in the whole human family.\n\nIt is hidden and individual, yet it is a collective affair.\n\nIn my quest to understand what Yivani conveyed, my conversations with him, and through a series of dialogues with parents and young people, I learnt that young people feel dismissed as \u201centitled millennials\u201d who do not \u201cfit in\u201d; their creativity is rejected as \u201cirresponsible\u201d; and they are criticised by us for a \u201clack of resilience\u201d.\n\nMany feel choked by rigid systems, and are confused by the fractured social institutions, divided social constructs and fragmented hostile workplaces.\n\nHistoric interpersonal and intrapersonal violence is ingrained in the fabric of our society in all its structures.\n\nOur society no longer mirrors core human values.\n\nThere is a mismatch between the image my generation projects and actual reality.They are more sensitive to truth than our generation.\n\nWe were immersed in survival mode, and learnt maladaptive tricks to outlast a hostile and inhuman past, adeptly \u201cplay the false game\u201d and have a veneer of \u201cexternal success\u201d.\n\nThey are more real and can never duplicate our \u201csuccess\u201d, so they internalise and blame themselves for the disconnection.\n\nMany lack access to support or are on medication but cannot afford the cost of individual therapy.\n\nWhat good is it if our children must die so that we should live?\n\nThe invitation is to recover and restore the fabric of the integrity of the human system disturbed over many generations to rebuild the individual.\n\nIt is to return to the truth of the core requirements of human existence. Individualised and fragmented thinking about the symptoms instead of the root causes is futile.\n\nWe remember Yivani and all young people who died by suicide in South Africa and across the globe.\n\nWe recognise the families and friends of all those who endure the pain resulting from this loss.\n\nDeath by suicide affects all families regardless of race, social class or gender.\n\nIn this Mental Health Awareness Month, there are interventions that we as a country and society can make.\n\nGovernment should urgently become a signatory to the first and second UN resolutions on mental health and human rights; sponsor and participate in the upcoming third UN resolution on mental health and human rights; investigate all policy impediments that discriminate and limit access to treatment, and enact measures to address discriminatory access to mental healthcare; and devise a means to develop collective social healing and individualised treatments to address upheavals and tensions caused by social transition, historical trauma and fractured family structures.\n\nIt is not the responsibility of government alone to respond to this crisis.\n\nCitizens, civil society, schools, churches, workplaces and other institutions should designate zones of peace to address the structural and cultural conditions that exacerbate individual despair, and hold suffering and lack of mental wellbeing.\n\nThey should also address the social stigma, exclusion, workplace coercion and hostility, and social and interpersonal violence that entrench a lack of mental health and wellbeing. #WeAreAllAffectedToo\n\nSiwendu is a judge and a trustee of the Yivani Mbali Foundation", "description": "I have experienced the anguish of loss when, on July 28 2018, I lost my youngest son Yivani Mbali Ndizana to suicide.
