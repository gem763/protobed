It has accumulated few than 1,000 miles since it was restored, ensuring everything looks excellent. Whether you\u2019re cruising through town or attend a local car meet, this Mopar is sure to impress.\n\nWhile looks are certainly important with this car, the 440ci V8 shoved under the hood is just as key to your enjoyment. After all, muscle cars are supposed to be all about offering monumental power. Dual 4bbl carbs help with the engine breathing freely, while an 8-core aluminum radiator keeps it from running too hot. In addition, there\u2019s a nice 4-speed manual transmission and a pistol grip shifter, so you can double-clutch this ride to victory.\n\nNow that you know this is a proper performance vehicle, you can concentrate on how this Dodge looks. The Hemi Orange Metallic paint sparkles in the sunlight, with black accents on the hood, door handles, and spoiler, matching the black vinyl roof. Both bumpers look almost liquid, thanks to the fresh chrome. This car rolls on 17-inch Rev custom wheels, matching the exterior perfectly.\n\nRestored with amazing care, you\u2019ll find the interior is virtually all stock. That includes the fresh vinyl upholstery which matches the original design, fresh black carpeting, and even the wood grain portions of the dash. Air conditioning through a Vintage Air system has been added, along with an Alpine CD/MP3 sound system.\n\nOne of the most iconic pony cars to emerge from the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Dodge Challenger is a household name today. That\u2019s great news if you want to grab one as an investment. Through a combination of iconic looks and thrilling performance, this vehicle earned a well-deserved reputation.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in buying this particular car, contact Premier Auction Group for information about placing a bid.\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bid on this classic Mopar.
