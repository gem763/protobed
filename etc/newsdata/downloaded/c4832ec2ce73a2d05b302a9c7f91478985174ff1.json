Reuters/Lee Smith/File Photo\n\nKohli\u2019s men lead the World Test Championship table but India have not won any global tournament since lifting the 2013 Champions Trophy under Mahendra Singh Dhoni.\n\n\u201cIt is a very good side. My only thing is that they need to win big tournaments,\u201d Ganguly, president-elect of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, told reporters in Kolkata.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they need to win every time. It\u2019s not possible. But we have gone through seven big tournaments without winning one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are a much better side than that. That is the only area where they need to get themselves ready mentally.\n\n\u201cTalent is enormous, otherwise they couldn\u2019t have played so well in the World Cup till the semi-finals. So that\u2019s an issue which Virat needs to address.
