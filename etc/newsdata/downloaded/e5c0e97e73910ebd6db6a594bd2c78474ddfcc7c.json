The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 142.22 points, or 0.53%, to close at 26,807.77. The S&P 500 fell 25.18 points, or 0.84%, to finish at 2966.60, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 118.83 points, or 1.46%, to close at 7993.63.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are scheduled to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Liu for trade talks in two weeks.\n\nBeijing has reportedly issued waivers to several domestic companies to buy American soybeans without being subject to retaliatory tariffs. Still, the major disputes between the two countries remain unsolved and it\u2019s unclear whether an interim deal will be reached at the high-level meeting.\n\nSpeaking to the U.N. General Assembly today, President Trump listed a series of accusations against Beijing\u2019s \u201cunfair practices,\u201d including currency manipulation, heavy state subsidies, and intellectual property theft. \u201cHopefully we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut as I have said, I will not accept a bad deal.\u201d\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nTrump also slammed Iran\u2019s alleged role in the attacks on Saudi oil facilities during his U.N. speech, calling world leaders to pressure Tehran into diplomatic talks. \u201cNo responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s blood lust, \u201c said Trump. \u201cAs long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted, they will be tightened.\u201d\n\nFrance, Germany, and the U.K. also issued a joint statement on Tuesday, joining the U.S. in blaming Iran for the Saudi attack and urging Tehran to start negotiating a new deal that would be more comprehensive than the 2015 one, from which President Trump withdrew last year. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the country is open to discussions for a new deal, if the U.S. lifted sanctions on the country.\n\nOn hopes of possible solutions to the region\u2019s geopolitical tension, crude prices fell on Tuesday despite concerns over Saudi\u2019s output recovery following the attack. The global benchmark Brent crude fell 2.58% to $63.10 a barrel on Tuesday, while the West Texas Intermediate dropped 2.30% to $57.29 a barrel.\n\nElsewhere, consumer confidence declined sharply to 125.1 in September, falling far short of economists\u2019 expectations for 133.3, and hitting a three-month low. \u201cOver much of the past year, consumers have remained relatively upbeat in their views, despite the obvious slowdown in the economy and the simmering relationship with China,\u201d wrote Jim Baird at Plante Moran Financial Advisors on Tuesday. \u201cEven so, gauges of confidence have been as volatile as the state of trade negotiations over that time, rising and falling as the prospects for an agreement with China evolved.\u201d\n\nDespite the falling sentiment, household spending remained positive, and that\u2019s especially key at this stage, given that business investment and trade conflict are both weighing on the economy. \u201cFor now, the consumer sector has been resilient and the spillover from other parts of the economy has been contained,\u201d wrote Baird. \u201cFor the economy to continue to power ahead, that will need to continue.\u201d\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "All three main stock indexes ended in the red.
