Following her wedding-that-never-was, she jetted off on her honeymoon to gather her thoughts, and \u2014 upon doing so \u2014 she returned home with a more positive attitude about everything that transpired between her and Callum.\n\nYes, both she and Callum have got along rather nicely since her return, and it became clear that there was no animosity between them.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s rather the opposite, as Whitney commented how happy she was that Callum was now free to be himself, while Callum has made it clear that he still very much cares about her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, with Leo (Tom Wells) trying to get his claws into Whitney, it\u2019s safe to say her alliance with her ex-fianc\u00e9 proves to be a problem for him. In fact, he believes that Callum could spoil his plan to get close to the young woman if he\u2019s not careful.\n\nAs a result, Leo sets about getting some dirt on the loveable undertaker, and it doesn\u2019t take him too long to do so, as he makes a surprising discovery. Later, he questions Callum about his time in the army.\n\nWhitney spots a file on Leo\u2019s laptop with Callum\u2019s name on it, and \u2014 upon accessing said file \u2014 she\u2019s later left devastated by what she finds.\n\nLeo has clearly set a trap \u2014 one that Whitney\u2019s walked right into.\n\nWill Whitney see through Leo\u2019s games? Or will she turn against Callum once and for all?\n\nOne to watch: Thursday 24th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Whitney gets more than she bargained for \u2014 but is this the end of her newfound friendship with Callum?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/18693068-high-b6a0_1570610892.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
