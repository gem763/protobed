(Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nAs of Wednesday night, everyone was speculating about which foreign country President Trump might have made a \u201cpromise\u201d to -- a commitment that prompted a U.S. intelligence community whistleblower to lodge a mysterious complaint.\n\nThe answer to that question is an ominous one for Trump and his supporters when it comes to what lies ahead. And that goes particularly for his 2020 reelection bid, even as we still know very little about the actual complaint.\n\nThe Washington Post broke the story late Wednesday that the whistleblower\u2019s complaint dealt with the president and a \u201cpromise\u201d he made to a foreign leader. And as The Post\u2019s Ellen Nakashima, Shane Harris, Greg Miller and Carol D. Leonnig again scooped Thursday night, the complaint is focused on Ukraine:\n\nA whistleblower complaint about President Trump made by an intelligence official centers on Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter, which has set off a struggle between Congress and the executive branch. The complaint involved communications with a foreign leader and a \u201cpromise\u201d that Trump made, which was so alarming that a U.S. intelligence official who had worked at the White House went to the inspector general of the intelligence community, two former U.S. officials said. Two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and political newcomer who was elected in a landslide in May.\n\nThat phone call took place July 25, and for a whole host of reasons \u2014 and depending on the substance of the complaint \u2014 it could spell real trouble for Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe main reason is because we already knew about demonstrated and very public interest from the Trump team in what Ukraine could provide them when it comes to Trump\u2019s reelection effort. Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has publicly urged the Ukrainians to pursue investigations that he has admitted would benefit Trump, and one in particular that could damage what appears to be Trump\u2019s most threatening potential 2020 Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.\n\nBack in May, Giuliani canceled a controversial planned trip to Ukraine that he had admitted was intended to apply pressure on its government to investigate Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, and his work for a Ukrainian gas company that had previously been of interest to investigators in the country.\n\nGiuliani even acknowledged before the planned trip that it was intended to help Trump and that Giuliani was \u201cmeddling\u201d in foreign affairs to that end.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not meddling in an election; we\u2019re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,\u201d Giuliani told the New York Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel. Giuliani added: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing illegal about it. Somebody could say it\u2019s improper. . . . I\u2019m asking them to do an investigation that they\u2019re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I\u2019m going to give them reasons why they shouldn\u2019t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nIt was a remarkable admission at the time \u2014 particularly that it could be \u201cvery, very helpful to my client\u201d and separating that from the idea that it might also happen to benefit the U.S. government. And it\u2019s even more remarkable in this moment.\n\nWhen Giuliani canceled the trip, he blamed the Ukrainian government and suggested Democrats had overblown the situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced from what I\u2019ve heard from two very reliable people tonight that the president [Zelensky] is surrounded by people who were enemies of the president [Trump], and people who are \u2014 at least [in] one case \u2014 clearly corrupt and involved in this scheme,\u201d Giuliani told Fox News.\n\nWe know basically nothing about what the whistleblower says Trump might have \u201cpromised\u201d or discussed about Ukraine, or even whether it specifically involved that July 25 phone call with Zelensky, which came two and a half weeks before the whistleblower complaint was filed on Aug. 12.\n\nBut perhaps tellingly, Giuliani appeared on CNN Thursday night and defended Trump as if there was some kind of a quid pro quo involving foreign aid and investigating the Bidens. (Giuliani will often be dispatched to head off bad stories for Trump, though sometimes he doesn\u2019t have his facts straight.)\n\n\"The reality is the president of the United States has every right to say to another leader of a foreign country, \u2018you got to straighten up before we give you a lot of money,\u2019\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt is perfectly appropriate for [Trump] to ask a foreign government to investigate this massive crime that was made by a former vice president.\u201d\n\nHe tweeted the same sentiment shortly thereafter, despite the allegations involving the Bidens being highly speculative and far from proven.\n\nA President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job. Maybe if Obama did that the Biden Family wouldn\u2019t have bilked millions from Ukraine and billions from China; being covered up by a Corrupt Media. \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) September 20, 2019\n\nSo we know that there was a clear interest from the Trump team when it came to what the Ukrainian government could offer Trump \u2014 not for the U.S. government, mind you, which Giuliani suggested could tangentially benefit from his trip, but specifically for Giuliani\u2019s \u201cclient.\" And now Giuliani is basically offering a preemptive defense.\n\nAnd not only that, but while all this was happening, the Trump administration was literally holding back military aid to Ukraine. In late August, it was reported that lawmakers were concerned that the administration was failing to provide $250 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is intended to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia. Last week, the administration relented to bipartisan pressure and released the funds.\n\nOver the last 36 hours, speculation about the countries to which Trump might have made problematic promises has focused on Russia, to which Trump disclosed highly classified information in a 2017 Oval Office meeting and has sought curiously friendly relations, and North Korea, with which Trump has pursued an elusive nuclear deal and made significant diplomatic concessions. If Trump made any quid pro quos with either, given their statuses as antagonistic foreign powers and even enemies, it would have been bad.\n\nBut when it comes to countries with which such \u201cpromises\u201d might have been particularly self-serving for Trump, Ukraine is near the top of the list.", "description": "On the list of potential quid pro quos that would have been problematic for Trump, one with Ukraine was among the worst.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/z2I_X_L9lzRKqKTSWPb5W-rPOV0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QMKT4ZSCHMI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
