A course on Lady Gaga (Sex, Gender and Identity) offered by the University of Virginia is one example of what\u2019s going on; another is the recent slew of tomes on the Beatles, Dylan and even the Clash emanating from campus corridors. Most shed little light on their already well-covered subjects (Why Dylan Matters by Harvard Latin don Richard F Thomas is an exception), and this self-styled \u201cfirst major academic study\u201d of the Stones likewise comes up short. The group have had many companions down the years, but surely few as dull.\n\nThe dead hand of academic prose is one problem; the assertion that the band\u2019s assorted documentaries are \u201cinstructive in terms of demonstrating the central influence of the Stones within the world of motion pictures\u201d is barely readable (and a clear misjudgment).\n\nAnother poser for the profs is that pop is rarely about music alone. Attitude, vibe, haircut, mascara, madness and live performance are potent ingredients of a mystique best captured by allusive, not analytical writing. That goes double in the case of the Stones whose core mythology is Mick Jagger as ambi-sexual demon Jack Flash with Keef and Ronnie as genial guitar-toting pirates holed up with a kif pipe, a line and a lamp draped in a Tibetan prayer shawl. Try getting a module out of that. Describing Jagger\u2019s place as frontman \u2013 a veritable dervish, as much athlete and bump\u2019n\u2019grind artiste as musician \u2013 we\u2019re told that his \u201clithesome dancing\u201d involves \u201crepeated Latin pelvic thrusts\u201d. No shit, Sherlock! Who knew? (About Mick\u2019s Puerto Rican heritage, that is.)\n\nThe collection is on firmer ground when considering the Stones on record. There\u2019s an entertaining look at a clutch of Stones country songs (Dead Flowers et al), a decent reassessment of their psychedelic period (Jumpin\u2019 Jack Flash as well as Their Satanic Majesties Request) and a welcome upgrade for Brian Jones as founder, world music maverick and the group\u2019s true dandy.\n\nThe couple of pages granted the Stones\u2019 60s singles are woefully inadequate. Songs such as Mother\u2019s Little Helper and Play With Fire are more than reflections of \u201cmod London\u201d, they are vignettes of a society in transition, when depressed mums took up pill habits and St John\u2019s Wood heiresses rubbed shoulders with pop stars and celebrity gangsters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Ambi-sexual demon Jack Flash\u2019: Mick Jagger in 1970. Photograph: Chris Walter/WireImage\n\nMost of the book\u2019s firepower is directed at the central album quartet of Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main Street (1972), all given sound but pedestrian readings, with much cooing over Mick Taylor\u2019s guitar solos. Since then, the Stones have barely made a coherent album, though the Companion is excited by the disco influences on 1978\u2019s Some Girls. There is, naturally, oodles about the blues, a subject already well represented in faculty libraries, though scant mention of the Stones\u2019 epiphanic encounter with Muddy Waters at Chicago\u2019s Chess Studios in 1964. Of the strong reggae flavours on 1970s albums like Black and Blue there is also no word.\n\nGiven that today\u2019s culture wars are waged with particular vigour on North American campuses (sex, gender and identity indeed), one might also have expected a discourse on the place of women in Stones songs, the offending (to some) litany running from Stupid Girl and Under My Thumb to Brown Sugar and Some Girls, but the sole female voice among the nine here is otherwise engaged. The question why anyone would want to write a song celebrating a serial killer of women (Midnight Rambler) doesn\u2019t arise; maybe it\u2019s just what Richards calls \u201ca blues opera\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to understand the crossfire hurricane that propelled the Stones during their 1968-72 pomp without considering Performance (1970), a glaring omission here. True, the film and its soundtrack are not a Stones venture, yet writer Donald Cammell\u2019s tale of faded pop star (Jagger) and East End gangster (James Fox) remains, in the words of Marianne Faithfull, a perceptive real-life Stones companion, \u201can allegory of libertine Chelsea with its baronial rock stars, wayward jeunesse dor\u00e9e, drugs, sex and decadence\u2026 a whole era under glass\u201d.\n\nShot through with esoteric ideas, Performance built on Jagger\u2019s infatuation with his dark side, apparent since Sympathy for the Devil (or \u201csome little twerp dancing round thinking he\u2019s Satan\u201d, according to Ry Cooder, a player on Let It Bleed and Performance). Jagger\u2019s character, Turner, is an amalgam of Jones and Richards, a matrix compounded by leading lady Anita Pallenberg, Richards\u2019s then partner (and Jones\u2019s ex). Keith and Anita\u2019s descent into junkiedom was among what Faithfull terms the film\u2019s \u201cdeadly aftereffects\u201d. Surely worth a doctoral thesis, then?\n\nThe Stones\u2019 attitude to academia was mocking rather than hostile. Mick, Keith and Brian were all ex-grammar school boys, respectively LSE undergrad, art-school dropout and trained musician. An early interviewer was perplexed by how such fine educations could result in their moronic reputation. \u201cThere are a lot of morons in grammar schools,\u201d shot back Mick.\n\nThis review is from the Observer\n\n\u2022 The Cambridge Companion to the Rolling Stones, edited by Victor Coelho and John Covach, is published by Cambridge University Press (\u00a315.99).
