Our goal remains to build a strong future for our employees and our business.\u201d\n\nAnd, per a letter from UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, \"some progress has been made.\"\n\nAbout half of the proposed jobs would be new and the rest would be considered \u201cretained\u201d because of the investment, Detroit Free Press reported. The funds are set to be invested into facilities with UAW representation, but a portion would go toward joint ventures that are separate from the union's contract with GM.\n\nThe offer reportedly includes a 2% wage increase for UAW workers for the first and third year of the contract and 2% lump-sum payments in the second and fourth years.\n\nGM said it also offered to build assembly plants in Michigan and Ohio.\n\nHealth care is a key point in the talks, too. GM and Ford both spend $1 billion a year on employee health care, but some industry officials argue that it isn\u2019t enough.\n\nAll terms of the contract are still being negotiated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nUAW began its strike against GM on Sunday night. The work action has not been without controversy. At least seven union protesters were arrested at a GM plant in Tennessee.\n\nGM\u2019s stock was down 96 percent as of press time.\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "We have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,\" GM said in a statement.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
