The AI system was so prompt that it detected haemorrhaging in just a second while delivering extreme accuracy.\n\nAccording to Jitendra Malik, PhD, with UC Berkeley and one of the co-authors of the study, \"Given the large number of people who suffer from traumatic brain injury every day and are rushed to the emergency department, this has very big clinical importance. That convinced me to work on this problem.\"\n\nThe main reason for the AI's stellar accuracy is the training data that has been added to the algorithm. The data compromised of a convolutional neural network with over 4,396 CT scans.\n\nDon't Miss 1.4 K SHARES 459 SHARES 201 SHARES 1.5 K SHARES\n\nHowever, as they say, everything is in the details, so is with this data. The abnormalities were highlighted at a pixel level. This allowed for the AI to not take noise and other blemishes in the image as a haemorrhage.\n\nTo add to its accuracy, the scanning was conducted in parts (in separate sections) as opposed to scanning it all at once, thus reducing the chances of error.\n\nUC Berkley\n\nNow the AI isn't really ready to replace a doctor yet, but it can considerably help doctors in determining the existence of hemorrhage as well as it's various types instantaneously -- something that is very time-sensitive and early Detection could help save the life of an individual with proper treatment.\n\nAccording to Pratik Mukherjee, MD, PhD, professor of radiology at UCSF and another co-author of the study \"The hemorrhage can be tiny and still be significant. That's what makes a radiologist's job so hard, and that's why these things occasionally get missed. If a patient has an aneurysm, and it's starting to bleed, and you send them home, they can die.\"", "description": "Researchers have trained AI to accurately detect even the most complex brain haemorrhage cases to save lives in the nick of time.
