Other demonstrators briefly lay in a pool of pink liquid, which they said depicted blood.\n\nThe protesters arrived before the first show and were gone a few hours later. Fashion editors, buyers and bloggers entered the building through another main door nearby.\n\n\"(The demonstrators) are calling for the fashion industry to tell the truth about its contribution to the climate and ecological crisis,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nAt a time of growing public environmental awareness, fashion brands are being urged to be more sustainable and cut waste.\n\nBFC Chief Executive Caroline Rush told Reuters demands to cancel Fashion Week did not \"solve the problem in terms of the way the industry needs to address the climate change emergency\".\n\n\n\n\n\nRAINFOREST INSPIRATION\n\n\"By having a platform like Fashion Week, it's an opportunity to bring designers and the industry together and engage them in the conversation,\" Rush said, adding the BFC was promoting a Positive Fashion initiative.\n\n\"We're looking forward to five days of incredible creativity and we'll be showcasing fantastic businesses, that many of them are already working in terms of how they can address the climate change emergency and what they're doing to address positive change.\"\n\nIn a separate protest, nine members of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) group poured buckets of black slime over themselves to highlight what they called \"the hazardous waste associated with the leather industry\".\n\nLondon Fashion Week is the second leg of a month-long catwalk season that also includes New York, Milan and Paris.\n\nThe shows draw buyers, editors and bloggers, and in London for the first time, the public will also mingle by the catwalks.\n\nLondon will hold six public shows where, for tickets priced at 135 pounds and 245 pounds, fashion fans can watch models strutting down the catwalk in outfits by Alexa Chung, Henry Holland and Self-Portrait.\n\nDesigner Mark Fast, known for his knitwear, held London's first show, presenting a colourful rainforest-inspired line of vivid green and neon pink cropped tops with matching short skirts.\n\nAlso nodding to 1990s looks, there were brightly-coloured fringed dresses, mesh tops and snakeskin prints on outfits and footwear that included lace-up heels and knee-high boots, all inspired by the rainforest flora and fauna.\n\n\"The destruction of the rainforest started to happen and I thought maybe this show should be a celebration of the beauty of the Amazon,\" Fast told Reuters backstage referring to the recent fires in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nAsked about the Extinction Rebellion protest, Fast said: \"We all have our own fights we have to express and we express it in different ways.\"\n\nDesigner Bora Aksu looked to Persian princess and women's rights activist Taj Saltaneh for his frilly dresses embroidered with floral patterns.\n\nAksu contrasted pastels with bright orange, red and pink for layered tulle and organza frocks as well as printed dresses, accessorised with lace tights and floral headpieces. Models also wore tailored jackets, capes and calf-length trousers.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Jayson Mansaray; Writing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Peter Graff, Andrew Heavens and Raissa Kasolowsky)", "description": "Climate activists glued themselves to a door and poured out a \"bleeding\" red carpet at the opening of London Fashion Week on Friday, seeking to draw attention to the apparel industry\u2019s impact on the environment.
