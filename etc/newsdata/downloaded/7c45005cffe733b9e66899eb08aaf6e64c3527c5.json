(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nThe American people deserve to see the evidence regarding what allegedly transpired between President Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president. Yet before the facts were known, Congress officially pursued an impeachment probe. And that\u2019s alarming.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally succumbed to pressure from fellow Democrats \u2014many of them freshman members \u2014 and announced Tuesday she\u2019d allow the inquiry to proceed. This is only the fourth time in U.S. history that a formal impeachment inquiry has been brought against a president. It\u2019s extremely serious.\n\nPelosi acted on unverified accusations made public by second-hand sources, choosing not to wait for the Trump administration to release the transcript of the July phone call in question, which it did Wednesday morning. Congress has not seen the full whistleblower report that alleges Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine into investigating allegations that Joe Biden used threats to quash an investigation by that country into his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings there.\n\nThe hasty nature of Pelosi\u2019s decision speaks volumes.\n\nThomas Jipping, deputy director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, says the House majority would have more credibility if it had put the facts first.\n\n\u201cTo claim with a straight face that you aren\u2019t engaging in partisan politics when you take this grave step while admitting you don\u2019t know the facts doesn\u2019t pass the stink test,\u201d Jipping says. \u201cThey\u2019ve put the cart before the horse. Impeachment is a conclusion word.\u201d\n\nSo while the Democrats may opine about preserving democracy and defending the Constitution, by jumping the gun on the impeachment inquiry House leadership has made it clear this move was largely political.\n\nEven more moderate members of the Democratic caucus, such as Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, have made the call to support impeachment.\n\nIn a tweet, Slotkin said: \u201cI swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. If true, these new allegations against the President are a threat to our national security, and constitute an impeachable offense.\u201d\n\nCongress will now look into whether Trump abused his office by encouraging the Ukrainian government to investigate Democratic presidential contender Biden and his son.\n\nSome sense of fairness should prevail. The House is obliged to look into allegations that Biden, as vice president, bullied the Ukrainians into firing a prosecutor who was investigating a company Hunter Biden was associated with. What Biden is accused of doing sounds not much different than what Trump is alleged to have done.\n\nIn the partial transcript of the call, Trump openly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with U.S. officials, including Rudy Giuliani and the U.S. attorney general.\n\n\u201cI would like for you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d Trump said to Zelensky. \"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.\"\n\nJust a few days prior to the call, Trump confirmed that he ordered the freezing of nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine.\n\nThis was a really dumb thing for Trump to do \u2014 it looks bad.\n\nBut until the public has all the facts, and fully understands what happened and why, it is too early to pronounce judgment.\n\nCongress should have waited, too.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2019/09/26/editorial-pelosi-jumped-gun-impeachment-probe/2439656001/", "description": "Until the public has all the facts, and fully understands what happened and why, it is too early to pronounce judgement.", "authors": ["The Detroit News", "Published P.M.
