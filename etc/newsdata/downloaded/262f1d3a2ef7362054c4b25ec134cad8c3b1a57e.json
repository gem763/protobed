He was reported missing Sunday evening after a boating accident on Kentucky Lake in TN. USA TODAY\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The last evening that country singer Craig Morgan spent with his 19-year-old son, Jerry, was during one of Morgan\u2019s performances at Grand Ole Opry three years ago.\n\n\u201cThe last pictures I have of us together is on that stage,\u201d Morgan, 55, said backstage at the Opry House this week. \u201cSo this is a very special place. It was anyway before, but now it has additional meaning, knowing this is where we hung out together.\u201d\n\nHis son, Jerry, who was home visiting from college, died in a drowning accident on Kentucky Lake in July 2016. Three years later, Morgan, who wasn\u2019t signed to a label at the time, came back to the Opry this past summer to sing a song he wrote about his son called \u201cThe Father, My Son, and The Holy Ghost.\u201d\n\nHe sang about crying until he passed out, praying until he thought he couldn\u2019t anymore and realizing that one day he\u2019ll be reunited with his son. Morgan stepped off stage, physically and emotionally exhausted from the performance, and told his friend Ricky Skaggs, the bluegrass singer and Country Hall of Famer, that he didn\u2019t know if he could sing that song again.\n\n\u201cRicky told me, \u2018You have to sing this song for the rest of your life,\u2019\u201d Morgan recalled.\n\nCraig Morgan performing at \"Luke Combs Joins the Grand Ole Opry Family\" at Grand Ole Opry on July 16, 2019 in Nashville, Tenn.

His friend and fellow Opry member, Blake Shelton, spent several days tweeting about the song and urging his 20 million Twitter followers to download the song from iTunes and push it up the charts.\n\nMore: Body of singer Craig Morgan's son found\n\nMore: TobyMac says late son 'had an untamable grand personality,' shares last text exchange\n\nSoon other celebrities like Kelly Clarkson, Ellen DeGeneres, Luke Combs, Carson Daly and more joined Shelton\u2019s impromptu social media campaign. The song hit No. 3 on Billboard\u2019s country digital song sales without the help of a label or radio play.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know what was happening,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cI was in Alaska and had no idea what was going on until I started getting texts from everyone.\u201d\n\nMorgan, an Army veteran whose had hits like \u201cThat\u2019s What I Love About Sunday\u201d and \u201cRedneck Yacht Club,\u201d said that since releasing the song, he\u2019s been reading the hundreds of messages sent daily to him by fans who identify with the grief and pain, but also the hope that he described in the song.\n\n\u201cI felt a push. I felt shoved to do this, and not by people. For me, it was God,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nThe song lyrics are also a reference to Morgan\u2019s conversion to Roman Catholicism, which his family, including Jerry, had been going through at the time of his death. That faith and religious education is something he leaned on heavily over the past three years.\n\n\u201cAnd I know I\u2019ll see my son again because I know his faith,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nMorgan, who announced in September a new record deal with Broken Bow Records, said that the song has given him a purpose to help comfort others, especially people who have lost a child, and that was always God\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cYou know, the thing is, I would much rather none of this stuff happen and him to be able to be here,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the way it is. And now he\u2019s in a place where what\u2019s happening has a different meaning.\u201d\n\nVideo: Craig Morgan blends the old with the new\n\nMore: Autopsy confirms country singer's son drowned\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/25/craig-morgan-finds-gods-purpose-song-after-sons-death/2454774001/", "description": "The last evening that country singer Craig Morgan spent with his 19-year-old son, Jerry, was during one of Morgan\u2019s performances at Grand Ole Opry.", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Published A.M.
