The Bahamas cannot be expected to foot this bill alone,\u201d UN secretary general Antonio Guterres is expected to say on his arrival in Nassau, according to a transcript of his prepared remarks.\n\nGuterres was expected to visit over the weekend with people affected by the hurricane and the humanitarian teams assisting them. He planned to meet with the prime minister, Hubert Minnis, in Nassau.\n\nMinnis said earlier this week that the official death toll stood at 50 but was expected to rise.\n\nTropical Cyclone Nine is not expected to bring anywhere near the devastation of Dorian, even if it strengthens into a depression or storm.\n\nBut the potentially heavy rain and winds, which could reach 48 km/h (30 mph), could hamper relief efforts in the northern Bahamas, where the powerful and slow-moving Dorian flattened thousands of structures and left 76,000 people needing shelter, food, water and medical assistance.\n\nThe plight of Hurricane Dorian evacuees offers a frightening vision of 'climate apartheid' | Arwa Mahdawi Read more\n\nThe storm could delay the movement of food and water already on the ground, said a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency, Carl Smith, during a news conference.\n\n\u201cI hope it does not disrupt it. We have taken precautionary measures to address the potential impact that we may encounter,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, a charity that has served some 200,000 prepared meals in the Bahamas since Dorian hit, said it was sending ingredients to Great Abaco Island ahead of the storm in case helicopters were unable to deliver ready-cooked food in the affected areas.\n\nOfficials have erected large tents in Nassau to house those made homeless by Dorian. They plan to erect tent cities on the Abaco islands to shelter up to 4,000 people.", "description": "Tropical Cyclone Nine expected to drop up to 15cm of rain as operation to provide food and shelter continues", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e2e4129a7d1758f0d0ea97df86e4056004b368/0_182_5460_3276/master/5460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f6e3f0a263f7fd99f133957311c48f7e", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
