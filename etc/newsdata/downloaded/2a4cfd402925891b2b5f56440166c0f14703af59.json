But precious few attempts yield a reversal of the original ruling.\n\nIreland flew out specialist lawyer Derek Hegarty to Japan for Aki's disciplinary hearing, but the William Fry partner was unable to convince the panel to overturn the red card decision.\n\nWorld Rugby ruled there were no 'clear and obvious mitigating factors' to account for Aki's high tackle, and imposed an initial six-week suspension that was halved on account of the Connacht star's good disciplinary record.\n\nHead coach Schmidt had hinted Ireland would respect the outcome of the disciplinary hearing come what may when speaking straight after the weekend's bonus-point win over Samoa.\n\n'Once it's a red card you sense a loss of control over what happens next, no matter what you try to present,' said Schmidt.\n\n'There is a very hard line being taken and we'll just have to accept whatever decision is made by the judiciary.'\n\nThe World Cup has been blighted by a series of high tackles which have seen players narrowly escape serious injury.\n\nEngland's Owen Farrell was been the victim of two high tackles, the first against the USA and another during the win over Argentina.", "description": "Bundee Aki will miss the rest of the World Cup after receiving a three-match ban for his red card against Samoa.
