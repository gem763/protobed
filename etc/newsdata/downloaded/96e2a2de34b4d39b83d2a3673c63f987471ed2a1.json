(Saul Loeb/Reuters)\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) on Tuesday issued a scathing condemnation of President Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of northern Syria, calling it the the biggest mistake of his presidency.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s putting the nation at risk, and I think he\u2019s putting his presidency at risk,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd I hope he will adjust his policies like he did before. That would be actually be a sign of real leadership.\u201d\n\nTrump announced Sunday evening that the U.S. will pull back U.S. troops currently stationed in the north part of Syria, saying he does not want the U.S. to \u201cpolice\u201d the area any longer. However, he vowed to punish Turkey if the country takes any action the U.S. considers \u201coff limits.\u201d\n\nRepublican and Democratic critics of the move said a U.S. troop withdrawal would make room for expected Turkish invasion of the region and would leave the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who have been supported by U.S troops in fighting the Islamic State, open to attack.\n\n\u201cIf I hear the president say one more time, \u2018I made a campaign promise to get out of Syria,\u2019 I\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHis duty as commander-in-chief, I believe, compels him to act honorably by the Kurds, and it is impossible for Turkey to go into Syria and not create a devastating ripple effect, no matter what the president says to [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina Republican warned the move will \u201cpave the way to the re-emergence of ISIS\u201d and accused Trump of abandoning local Kurdish fighters, a charge Trump pushed back on Monday.\n\n\u201cIn no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters,\u201d the president said in a tweet.", "description": "\"If I hear the president say one more time, 'I made a campaign promise to get out of Syria,' I'm going to throw up,\" Graham said.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "Kevin D.
