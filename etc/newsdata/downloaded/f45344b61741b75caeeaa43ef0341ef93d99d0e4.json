(The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Tencent is facing pressure from all sides. This week, it broke with China\u2019s state broadcaster and aired NBA games, attracting about 25 million viewers. Investors from mainland China sold US$54 million in its stock following the decision, controversial because of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet earlier this month in support of the Hong Kong protests. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said this week he wants to stay engaged with China, and that there were some signs of de-escalation in the dispute over Morey\u2019s comments. The next day, however, ex-NBA star Shaquille O\u2019Neal further fanned the flames, saying Morey was right. Even if Tencent can manage the NBA criticism, it\u2019s up against a host of other issues. It\u2019s facing a decrease in revenue\u2014not to mention plenty of online backlash\u2014after Blizzard, a video game firm in which it has a stake, suspended a player for making pro-Hong Kong statements. China is also considering new rules for online gambling, one of Tencent\u2019s most lucrative product lines. And this week, Tencent said Facebook\u2019s Libra would pose a threat to its WeChat Pay system.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
