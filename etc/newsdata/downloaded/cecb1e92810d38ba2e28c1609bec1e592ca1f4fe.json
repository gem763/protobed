The message that we\u2019re not good enough, that we don\u2019t belong here comes at us from all directions \u2014 starting at the top with our own president constantly disrespecting and demeaning our community. It comes from being left out of popular culture, from Hollywood to the publishing world. It comes at us when our one Latino presidential candidate, Juli\u00e1n Castro, is held to a different standard than his white running mates. It comes from being yelled at by strangers for speaking Spanish or being pulled over by the police because of the color of our skin. It comes when we are made to feel uncomfortable for daring to occupy spaces not usually meant for us, like a fancy literary gala.", "description": "\u2018Excuse me, where are the restrooms?\u2019", "authors": ["Reyna Grande", "Reyna Grande Is The Author Of", "A Dream Called Home", "The Distance Between.", "She Is Originally Guerrero", "Mexico", "Entered The United States As An Undocumented Child Immigrant."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/vxJ5xpfJ7Gw0-PqIVpCdbfljKsA=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AKGQLF4TZVB6ZKJV26Q4LBKOXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
