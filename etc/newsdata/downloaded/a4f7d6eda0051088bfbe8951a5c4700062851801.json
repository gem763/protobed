From Austria to Tunisia, candidates, parties and voters have used Facebook and other platforms to make their voices heard in hundreds of elections this year. And it looks like a general election could soon be on its way in the UK too.\n\nMost of this activity is good for democracy as voters have new ways to share information and express their views. Candidates can get their ideas out to those who follow their pages or by using paid advertising to reach a wider audience. But we also recognise that social media can bring significant new risks to the political process. People who want to interfere unlawfully with the outcome of an election will use every available means to try and do so, including platforms like ours.\n\nWe have learned the lessons of 2016, when Russia used Facebook to spread division and misinformation in the US Presidential election. Since then we have made big changes. We\u2019ve built stronger defences to prevent people using our platforms to interfere with elections and we\u2019re continuing to make improvements in several key areas.", "description": "The world over, election campaigns are now played out as much on social media as they are on the doorsteps, in our newspapers and on TV screens.", "authors": ["Richard Allan", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000170378882-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
