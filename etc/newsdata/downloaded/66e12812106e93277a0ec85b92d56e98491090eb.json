We can't have our cities going to hell,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"They are in serious violation.\"\n\nTrump continued to pick fights with the blue state throughout his two-day visit, the primary purpose of which was to hoover up cash from wealthy Republican donors.\n\n...prompting the state's Democratic governor Gavin Newsom to publicly call out the Trump White House for a lack of \"moral authority\" and lamented the state's \"unfortunate relationship\" with the president.\n\nThe president and many Republicans see little downside to him making the nation's most populous state a ready villain.\n\n\n\n\"The voters that he's targeting in rural America look at California as an out-of-touch liberal state,\" said Republican consultant Alex Conant. \"There's no political cost to him bashing California.\"\n\n\n\nTrump and the Democratic-led state have battled throughout his two and a half years in office, with state attorney general Xavier Becerra filing more than 50 lawsuits against the Trump administration. They cover the president's initiatives on immigration, healthcare and the environment and have slowed and occasionally stopped the administration altogether.\n\n\n\nAnd it's not just the president's agenda that California has gone after; the sparring has gotten personal, too. The state passed a law that requires candidates for president and governor to release five years' worth of tax returns to appear on the state's primary ballot, a pointed slap at Trump, who veered from historical precedent by declining to release his tax returns.\n\n\n\nWith all sides acknowledging the state's serious problems with homelessness, the issue stands as a vulnerability for Democratic leaders and one that Trump can use as part of his broader effort to paint Democrats as out of touch and extreme. The president has yet to provide any specifics on how to deal with the complex homelessness problem, though.\n\n\n\nDemocratic senator Dianne Feinstein allowed that Trump was \"right that homelessness is a big problem in California. But how he explains the situation is wrong and raises significant concerns that his so-called solutions will only make matters worse.\"\n\n\n\nRepublican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said Trump wasn't bashing his home state but pointing out the shortcomings of Democratic leadership that has dominated California politics for years, especially as the Golden State has become the forefront of the Trump resistance.\n\n\n\n\"When he's talking about homelessness and solving that problem, and affordability, that goes across party lines,\" McCarthy told The Associated Press. \"Drive around - every community, even in Bakersfield - homelessness is the number one issue.\"\n\n\n\n\"They want to try to attack him, but you see how much support he has out there?\" he said. \"I think Californians are getting tired of the governor just fighting this president instead of trying to work with him. You don't have to agree with him all the time, but you can find common ground.\"\n\nProtesters flew a giant Baby Trump balloon next to the hotel where the president was holding a fundraising lunch in San Diego yesterday (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\n\n\nNewsom, in return, said he wants to work with Trump but is determined to \"push back when he tries to go after our dreams\" on diversity, reproductive rights and more.\n\n\n\n\"I don't think the attorney general wakes up looking for a lawsuit,\" but most of the cases involved are an attack on the state, he said. \"And so it's an unfortunate relationship.\"\n\n\n\nThat may not be unfortunate for Trump politically, though.\n\n\n\nTim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush and a longtime Trump critic, said that when Trump talks about the homeless problem in California and criticises its political leaders, \"he's not speaking to California Republicans. He's speaking to Republicans and independents nationally. I anticipate he'll continue that through 2020.\"\n\n\n\nTrump's presence in California and his attacks on its policies and politics were a welcome boost for the state's Republicans. \"My Republican friends in California keep their heads down and think the place has lost its mind,\" Conant said. \"It's not as if he's going into South Dakota and attacking the state's politics.\"", "description": "Donald Trump made a promise to a mystery foreign leader in private that so troubled one official in the US intelligence community they felt compelled to file a whistleblower complaint,\u00a0The Washington Post has reported.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
