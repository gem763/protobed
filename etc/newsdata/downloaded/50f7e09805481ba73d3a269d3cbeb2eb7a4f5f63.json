Hart had long been pegged as the Flyers goalie of the future and was sensational in spurts at times last season to give the Flyers a flicker of postseason hope.\n\nThey missed the playoffs - but Hart has Philly thinking it can wrestle its way into an Eastern Conference playoff spot.\n\nHart shined in the Philly debut of new coach Alain Vigneault, securing the shutout in his 33rd NHL game.\n\nVigneault has been known for quick fixes in previous stops and led Vancouver and the New York Rangers to the Stanley Cup Final. Vigneault certainly boasts the credentials that prove he\u2019s capable of turning the Flyers into winners. He has coached 16 NHL seasons for the Montreal Canadiens, Canucks and Rangers and his teams have made the playoffs 11 times.\n\nHayes and Couturier gave Hart a needed cushion when they scored 24 seconds apart against Cory Schneiderin the first minute of play in the third period.\n\nHayes is another new face expected to play a pivotal role in a potential Flyers\u2018 turnaround. Hayes signed a $50 million, seven-year contract and became the Flyers\u2018 third-highest paid player behind captain Claude Giroux and winger Jakub Voracek. He\u2019s coming off a career-high 55 points last season with the Rangers and Jets.\n\nThe Flyers also paid tribute to former star Wayne Simmonds. The Devils signed Simmonds to a one-year contract after the Flyers traded him to Nashville at the trade deadline. The 31-year-old Simmonds was a huge fan favorite and was wildly popular inside the locker room almost since the moment he was acquired in a 2011 deal with Los Angeles. He scored 23 goals and had 378 points in 584 games with the Flyers and was never afraid to drop the gloves when it was needed. With the Flyers out of the playoff race, they made the tough call to deal him at the deadline.\n\nSimmonds was greeted with hugs and handshakes from familiar arena staff as he made the way from the Devils bus to the locker room.\n\n\u201cI was, what, 22 when I got traded here? Turned 23 before the season and I was just coming in here trying to prove myself as a good hockey player,\u201d Simmonds said. \u201cI could have never imagined in my wildest dreams that they would take to me like they did. Obviously, it\u2019s an honor and it\u2019s nice to have played here.\u201d\n\nSimmonds got a roaring standing ovation when a video tribute played for him that featured testimonials from the Flyers on just how much they loved playing with the forward known as \u201cSimmer.\u201d He waved toward the fans in appreciation.\n\n\u201cSo many good things have happened for me in this building, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really one that I can probably put my finger on,\u201d Simmonds said. \u201cThere will probably be different things going through my mind.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Devils fell to 0-2-1. \u2026 Provorov had an assist on Couturier\u2019s goal for his 100th career point. \u2026 Gritty held a sign that read \u201cLindsey Could do Better\u201d behind Devils defenseman P.K. Subban. Subban dates ski sensation Lindsey Vonn.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Devils host Edmonton on Thursday.\n\nThe Flyers start a five-game road trip Saturday at Vancouver.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Carter Hart stopped 25 shots for his first career shutout to lift the Philadelphia Flyers to a 4-0 win over the New Jersey Devils on Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/devils_flyers_hockey_45822_c0-199-4742-2963_s1770x1032.jpg?414599da4133a155696ec82f0cc1a9ce5b6bd49f", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
