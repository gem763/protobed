Year by year results have led to an increasingly rigorous focus on data and what it tells us is to lift achievement further.\n\n\"I see over time how education systems and schools are becoming more sophisticated in their use of data sets.\n\n\"People forget it's only by having a shared national attainment across different circumstances [that] it's possible to have an evidence-based discussion about funding and resources.\"\n\nMr Bentley had worked on curriculum, jobs and economic development for the Tony Blair's UK Labour government before coming to Australia in the early 2000s.\n\nHe credits others for NAPLAN including former Liberal education minister Julie Bishop, who persuaded the states to sign up to a system of national testing in literacy and numeracy at ages 3, 5, 7 and 9 before the federal election in November 2007. The election delivered a new education minister: Julia Gillard.\n\nMs Gillard decided to launch NAPLAN and Mr Bentley was hired to integrate testing into the curriculum.\n\n\"Australia was in a situation where there was no transparent reporting of student performance because of fragmentation at state, federal and multi-sector levels. Diffusion and obscurity were the norm.\n\n\"And there was no way students' attainment could be measured against their demographic circumstances.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducators with their eyes open knew there was a problem. Ever since Australia joined the OECD's Program for International Student Assessment in 2000, literacy and numeracy levels had been falling. It gave rise to an expression, \"PISA shock\".\n\n'Fair bit of pushback'\n\n\"Julia Gillard was the champion, I was her point person,\" Mr Bentley said.\n\n\"There was a fair bit of pushback. There was uncertainty among some school principals. And education unions resisted.\"\n\nMs Gillard created the forerunner to the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA). Transparent testing was incorporated into the curriculum and funding for the states was made conditional on signing up to the curriculum, as part of the new National Partnership Agreements.\n\nIn 2009, a critical mass of state education ministers came on board.\n\n\"Curriculum development was very important and it still is. National curriculum and national development come together. Then in 2009 for the first time Australia had an evidence-based framework.\n\n\"It's important for citizens to be able look up and understand accurate information on their school and other schools in comparable circumstances.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis view is supported by an independent survey commissioned by ACARA which showed nearly 60 per cent of parents thought NAPLAN was either quite, very or extremely valuable. Among them, 62 per cent said they liked NAPLAN because it gave them a snapshot about their child's progress and 58 per cent liked it because it allowed comparison to other students in the state or country.\n\nCritics of NAPLAN condemned the shift to online testing, which gave rise to at least one of the five recent reviews. But the ACARA survey showed that as online testing spread between 2016 and 2018, parents had fewer concerns about it.\n\nAs for claims that parents use NAPLAN results to \"shop for schools\", in 2018 two-thirds of parents had not used the My School website.\n\n'Powerful tool'\n\nDerek Scott, principal of Melbourne private school Hailebury, said he has never had a complaint from a parent about NAPLAN.\n\nThe ability to slice the data and match similar and different groups gives the school a \"powerful tool\".\n\n\"Parents look at individual results but the school uses it collectively,\" Mr Scott said.\n\n\"We break the data down by campus and class. If a teacher has done exceptionally well we look at their strategies and spread them around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If a teacher has done exceptionally well we look at their strategies and spread them around.\" Derek Scott, principal of Haileybury school, Melbourne. Arsineh Houspain\n\n\"Australia now has a system of standardised testing that is deep and rich in data which we should use.\n\n\"I come back to the notion of accountability and transparency which is missing in large sections of the education system. Many educators don't want that but we must push back to lift results for our students.\"\n\nAt the other end of the educational spectrum is David Wantsall, principal of Ballajura Primary School in the northern suburbs of Perth. He said staff go through NAPLAN results question by question for 750 students.\n\n\"It isn't the be-all and end-all. There are some things it can't measure like social and emotional performance.\n\n\"But it helps us to improve, and our performance has been strong. There's no pushback from teachers. Staff see results as a validation, they know they are doing the right thing.\n\n\"Parents are pleased. Working-class parents do want to see their kids doing the three Rs. They want 21st century skills like creativity but they understand literacy and numeracy are good.\"\n\nThe claim by NAPLAN critics that schools ignore creativity and emotional development in favour of \"teaching to the test\" is rejected by other principals, as well as the man behind NAPLAN himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Scott said it is not possible to literally teach the test, especially now that NAPLAN online creates a different test for each student. \"But if teachers were teaching to the test it wouldn't be a bad thing,\" he said. \"The focus is literacy and numeracy.\"\n\nMr Bentley said teaching to the test was a \"reasonable\" concern but did not detract from the usefulness of being told to lift achievement.\n\n\"NAPLAN was developed in parallel with the curriculum. NAPLAN data is not far from the competence we want kids to have. We want breadth of experience and development. NAPLAN has a beneficial impact,\" Mr Bentley said.", "description": "As policy adviser to education minister Julia Gillard, Tom Bentley in 2008 brought in a revolutionary new set of ideas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4647%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_526%2C$y_46/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/176c2b8c0adf7d50519e043089090d708963358b", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
