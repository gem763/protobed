He\u2019s meant a whole lot to our team,\u201d Rams head coach Sean McVay said after the trade. \u201cI think just the confidence, the swagger, the veteran leadership that he\u2019s brought \u2014 he\u2019s been, really, a big part of what\u2019s gone on since he got here and he\u2019s been nothing but positive since he got here. Like I\u2019ve said, I think he\u2019s a Hall of Fame player.\u201d\n\nTalib was placed on injured reserve with a rib injury after the Rams\u2019 Week 5 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. He is eligible to come off IR late in the regular season, but it\u2019s unlikely he will play a down with the Dolphins.\n\nThe winless Dolphins essentially bought a fifth-round draft pick from the Rams to pay the remaining balance of Talib\u2019s $4.2 million contract this season. The All-Pro cornerback will become an unrestricted free agent after this season.\n\nMore on our trade with the Rams.\n\nRead More > https://t.co/JKEvGKPyDA\u2014 Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) October 29, 2019\n\nIn five games this season, Talib had 14 total tackles and two pass breakups.
