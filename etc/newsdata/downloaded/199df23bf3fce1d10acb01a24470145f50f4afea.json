Time moves fast, friends, and now that feels like the bad old days of luxury travel. Since October 1, CNN reports, Singapore Airlines has been serving specialty salads made from fresh produce on its 19-hour Newark-to-Singapore route. The veggies are grown at AeroFarms, an indoor vertical farm less than 2km from Newark Liberty Airport, which plans to make deliveries several times a week.\n\nIn case you were getting excited, know that this only applies to passengers in business class, though Singapore Airlines is considering expanding to feed the peasants in coach eventually. The first month\u2019s salad will be arugula with heirloom tomatoes, cured Iberico ham, grilled palm hearts, and spiced tomato dressing. It pairs well with chardonnay.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be more sustainable and reduce our carbon footprint by using hyper-local produce,\u201d Singapore Airline\u2019s food and beverage director Antony McNeil told CNN, \u201cand we wanted the in-flight food to taste as vibrant as possible.\u201d I\u2019m not quite sure how much of a dent fresh organic produce will put in the airline\u2019s carbon footprint compared to, you know, flying, but I guess it\u2019s a noble goal. Singapore Airlines says that if this program is successful, it will begin partnerships with other vertical farms near its other U.S. hubs.\n\nWhat\u2019s really interesting about this is AeroFarms itself. It\u2019s been around since 2004, and it\u2019s all indoors, under LED lights, so it can produce food all year round. It uses 95% less water than a conventional farm; instead of watering with sprinklers, the farmers spray the roots of the plants with mist bottles. It\u2019s completely organic, with no fungicides or pesticides. The farm grows 700 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and supplies local restaurants. Will this be how we\u2019ll get our food in the future?", "description": "Do you remember that scene in Crazy Rich Asians where Rachel and Nick fly to Singapore and they get to sleep in real beds while wearing real pajamas?
