Former MMA fighter Gina Carano, \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d director Taika Waititi, and Carl Weathers were among the cast members that appeared on stage at D3 to tee up the trailer, which featured a surprise appearance by Werner Herzog, and began with a shot of Storm Trooper heads on pikes, a clue this series will be dark and aimed at adults.\n\nBut \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d was the very earliest new show that Disney publicly announced in November 2017, back before its streaming service even had a name.\n\nWhat captured attention all weekend were the surprises\u2014and most of them are reboots, remakes, or spinoffs.\n\nDisney+ will get a \u201cLizzie McGuire\u201d revival series, starring Hilary Duff as the original character from the beloved Disney Channel show, now in her 30s. The original series ran from 2001 to 2004. The show will be on Disney+ in time for its Nov. 12 launch date.\n\n\u201cHigh School Musical\u201d is getting a revival of sorts: a live-action series about a high school putting on a musical of the show \u201cHigh School Musical.\u201d The name of the show is \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series\u201d and it will hit Disney+ at launch.\n\nIf that isn\u2019t enough theater-related content, Kristen Bell (\u201cVeronica Mars\u201d) is hosting a reality show about high school theater kids reuniting as adults to put on a play together. The show, \u201cEncore!,\u201d will be available on Disney+ at launch.\n\n\u201cMonsters Inc.\u201d is getting a spinoff series, an animated show that picks up right where the original movie left off, after the monsters of Monsters, Inc. change their energy-collection method from extracting screams to laughter. The show will be called \u201cMonsters at Work,\u201d and it has no premier date yet.\n\n\u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d is getting a spinoff movie focused on the Candace character from the Disney Channel animated series, which ran from 2008 through 2015. The movie will be called \u201cPhineas and Ferb The Movie: Candace Against the Universe.\u201d\n\nTo continue the live-action remake train, Disney is putting a \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d live-action movie on Disney+ at launch. Keep in mind that the live-action \u201cAladdin\u201d remake has brought in $1.04 billion at the global box office, while the live-action \u201cLion King\u201d is at $1.51 billion and still going.\n\nEven Forky, the new spork character from this summer\u2019s box-office hit \u201cToy Story 4,\u201d is getting a spinoff: a series of one-off shorts starring the character, grouped together as \u201cForky Asks A Question.\u201d The shorts will begin hitting Disney+ at launch and Disney played one of them at D3.\n\nMarvel and Jeff Goldblum\n\nDisney also gave more details on some of the already-announced Marvel shows, including the animated series \u201cWhat If...?\u201d, in which Marvel superheroes explore alternate plotlines that would not be possible in the film timeline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; \u201cWandavision,\u201d a series about \u201cScarlet Witch\u201d Wanda Maximoff (played by Elizabeth Olson); and \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier,\u201d about Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and \u201cWinter Soldier\u201d Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan).\n\nOh, and Jeff Goldblum, the extremely popular actor from \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and more recently the Apartments.com ads, is getting his own Anthony Bourdain-type travel series called \u201cThe World According to Jeff Goldblum.\u201d That will be sitting on the service at launch.\n\nGary Marsh, president and CCO of Disney Channels Worldwide, introduces Hilary Duff at Disney's D23 expo in Anaheim, Calif., on Aug. 23, 2019.

The service will have something for all fans: Marvel devotees; Star Wars geeks; millennials who grew up watching Disney Channel shows; animation lovers; new parents of young kids.", "description": "Disney gave more detail about what its new streaming service will have to offer in November.", "authors": ["Daniel Roberts", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gjkXaXyEzqz0S1.7S6LmWw--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/c71a3740-c825-11e9-aff5-845e86301c10", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
