(Picture: BBC)\n\nThis episode of Casualty concentrates quite heavily on relative newcomer Mason (Victor Oshin). Over the space of five days we follow him through some high and low points and also get a glimpse of his home life. Is this the episode where we\u2019ll find out why he acts like he does, and will Mason finally come good?\n\nMeanwhile, David (Jason Durr)\u2019s ex-wife wants Ollie (Harry Collett) to come back to live with her. David\u2019s not happy about it, but will he manage to stand up for what he wants this time, or has he lost Ollie again? And Ethan (George Rainsford) and Effie (Abigail Hardingham) grow closer as she tries to decide whether to go on the CF trial. Here are all the spoilers to look out for.\n\n1. At the beginning of the episode we see Mason being interviewed by Ethan. He reassures Ethan that \u2018things are going great\u2019 \u2013 but are they really? And why does he have a bruise on his face? Flashbacks to the week leading up to that point might give us some answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Ethan is reluctant to give Effie advice about whether to go on the CF trial or not. What will she decide?\n\n3. David is upset to hear that his ex-wife wants Ollie to live with her again. Both Ollie and David pretend they don\u2019t really mind, but Rosa (Jacey Salles) is determined to make David face up to how he really feels about Ollie. Will she manage to get through to both father and son?\n\nIs Ethan heading for heartbreak? (Picture: BBC)\n\n4. The ED staff team are doing their best to be supportive, friendly and welcoming to Mason but his arrogant attitude threatens to turn them all away \u2013 especially as he can always find someone to shift the blame to when things go wrong.\n\n5. Effie is rushed into resus when she finds it hard to breathe \u2013 and it looks like both Ethan and Effie feel more than just a doctor/patient bond. Is Ethan heading for heartbreak?\n\n6. Patients this week include a woman with breathing difficulties and a roast dinner to prepare, and a woman whose fall from a wall is just the tip of the iceberg of a whole host of problems.\n\nDoes David want Rosa\u2019s advice? (Picture: BBC)\n\n7. In a week in which he manages to upset several of his colleagues, Mason shows glimpses of what a good doctor he could be. But when he realises he\u2019s overlooked a vital test on a patient will he be able to correct his mistake in time?\n\nSue Haasler is the author of the official Holby City book, which you can read about here.
