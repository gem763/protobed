There is so many things that can happen at a championship, so we want to make sure all our ladies are ready; no matter who you call on we'll be ready.\"\n\n\n\nWith the U.S. women sprinters turning in unimpressive results in Doha, Jamaica's biggest threat at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games could very well come from Britain.\n\n\n\nAsher-Smith established her credentials as a reliable medal producer by collecting three in Doha \u2014 gold in the 200 and silver in the 100 metres and relay.\n\n\n\n\"It was absolutely fantastic to go and run out there and we are on the best way to Tokyo,\" said Asher-Smith. \"We are ready.\n\n\n\n\"We worked for this really hard.\"", "description": "A United States quartet led by Christian Coleman blazed to the 4x100 metres relay title at the world athletics championships on Saturday, clocking the second fastest time ever at 37.10 seconds to end a 12-year gold medal drought.", "authors": ["Thomson Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5310724.1570311765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/iaaf-world-athletics-championships-doha-mens-4x100m.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
