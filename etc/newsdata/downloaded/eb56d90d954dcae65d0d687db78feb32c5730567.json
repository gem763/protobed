Google\u2019s flagship Chrome OS devices typically start at $US1,000 ($1,466), so the $US650 ($953) price tag on the base-level Pixelbook Go is incredible.\n\nEditor's Note: The Pixelbook Go does not currently have an Australian release date or pricing, so it's unlikely we'll get it here.\n\nThe New Google Stuff We Won't Get In Australia Google announced a slew of new products overnight, including the long-anticipated Google Pixel 4 range and the Nest Mini. But there were a few new goodies that we sadly won't be seeing in Australia. Read more\n\nCompared to other Google-made Chrome OS devices, the Pixelbook Go is a fantastic budget alternative that gives you some of the best elements of Chrome OS in a very thin, light, and well-made device. The problem is Google isn\u2019t the only one making Chrome OS devices, and $US650 ($953) is, in fact, an average to above-average price for a Chromebook not made by Google, and it\u2019s an above-average price for a Chromebook that can\u2019t be used as a tablet.\n\nYou will be faced with a tough question when considering the Pixelbook Go versus the myriad of cheaper and more versatile Chromebooks: Is it really good enough to justify paying $US650 ($953)? The battery life alone makes me think yes.\n\nPixelbook Go\u2019s battery life is some of the most remarkable we\u2019ve seen in a laptop at this price point. Without that, you\u2019d find yourself confused by the Pixelbook Go. There are four variants of the Pixelbook Go, a $US650 ($953) version with an 8th-gen m3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a 1080p touch display, a $US850 ($1,246) version that bumps the processor up to an i5 and the storage to 128GB, a terribly priced $US1,000 ($1,466) version that tacks on an additional 8GB of RAM, and finally a maxed-out $US1,400 ($2,052) version with an i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a 4K display.\n\nThe $US650 ($953) version is what most people should be considering, but Google sent us the $US850 ($1,246) version, and that\u2019s what\u2019s featured here.\n\nGoogle Pixelbook Go WHAT IS IT? Google's newest home-grown Chromebook. PRICE Starts at $US650 ($953); Reviewed at $US850 ($1,246) LIKE The battery life is incredible. It's also super light and feels very high quality. NO LIKE It's weirdly priced and can't double as a tablet\u2014most Chromebooks can.\n\nI say the $US650 ($953) version is what most people should consider because I\u2019ve used a lot of Chromebooks over the year, and an inordinately larger number of them this year alone.\n\nChrome OS is a brilliant little operating system that\u2019s perfect for 2-in-1 devices meant to function as fun tablets for playtime and little laptops for work time. It\u2019s very good, but it still isn\u2019t good enough, in most instances, to warrant a high price on hardware compared to a Windows or macOS device.\n\nThe amount of stuff you can do on a Chromebook continues to pale compared to macOS and Windows. There is now the option to turn on Linux tools, which makes it a much more solid machine for some quick dev and programming work. But there\u2019s still a limit on what you can do in Linux. Google\u2019s Pixelbooks are fan-free products, so if you start getting too intense with the CPU workload, it will slow down to avoid overheating.\n\nMost people don\u2019t want a Pixelbook for coding though. You just want a really good Chromebook that\u2019s, ideally, cheaper than a Windows or macOS device. The problem for the Pixelbook Go is, it\u2019s priced very oddly. If you opt for the $US850 ($1,246) one Google sent Gizmodo, there\u2019s a really solid selection of similarly priced Windows laptops you can get for around the same price.\n\nThe HP Envy 13 and Lenovo Yoga 700 series both start for around $US750 ($1,099) in the U.S. market and allow you to do a lot more\u2014including some light PC gaming. The downside is, they\u2019re bigger and heavier devices.\n\nThe texture on the bottom of the device is definitely interesting. Those screws may be exposed, but nothing in the Pixelbook Go is user upgradable. (Photo: Alex Cranz, Gizmodo)\n\nGoogle\u2019s play seems to be to sell a laptop at the same price as those Windows devices, but that does less and yet is way more portable. At 2.3 pounds and just .5 inches thick the Google, Pixelbook Go is lighter and thinner than the competitors and feels just a little more sturdy. The waves along the bottom are a unique feature that gives the Pixelbook Go a sense of purposeful style that laptops at this price range generally lack. It looks great, the 1080p display is sharp and responsive to touch, and even the speakers have a little more detail and boom than you expect for a \u201cbudget\u201d device.\n\nThe keyboard, in particular, is outstanding. It sort of reminds me of the Surface Laptop 3. It\u2019s not very clacky and gentle on your fingers. But where the Surface Laptop 3 veers into feeling mushy, the Pixelbook Go stops just short of mushy.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a little tactile bump at the end of the keypress that slows each keypress down and makes them feel more enjoyable. If I had to liken it to any kind of key available now I might compare it to the Topre hybrid mechanical and membrane key\u2014though it lacks that switch\u2019s excellent travel and satisfying clonk.\n\nPhoto: Alex Cranz, Gizmodo\n\nBut remember how I said the Pixelbook Go is priced awkwardly? That\u2019s because it\u2019s kind of smack in the middle between the best budget Windows laptops and the best budget Chromebooks. If you decide to go for it because you don\u2019t need the additional productivity capabilities (and weight and size) of a Windows device, then you\u2019re likely already in the market for a Chromebook.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a Chromebook, though, the $US850 ($1,246) version of the Pixelbook Go starts to make a lot less sense. The $US650 ($953) version with the m3 processor and measly 64GB of storage is really all you\u2019ll need, and it\u2019s spec\u2019d quite similarly to sub $US600 ($879) Chromebooks like the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2. Although, again, it\u2019s lighter and smaller than they are.\n\nAnd those devices, for the most part, are 2-in-1 convertible laptops. The Pixelbook Go is purely a laptop, and I\u2019m not crazy about that choice. Google has made such an effort to create a really engaging OS that easily switches between laptop and tablet mode, and it\u2019s frustrating that, apart from a touch display, there\u2019s no physical nod to Chrome OS\u2019s excellent touch elements.\n\nIt\u2019s also frustrating because a lot of the Android apps now available on Chrome OS just don\u2019t work as well (or at all) with a mouse and keyboard. A 360-degree hinge feels like such a relatively minor thing, but it would have made the Pixelbook Go just a little more competitive with our favourite Chromebooks.\n\nAll photos: Alex Cranz (Gizmodo)\n\nAnd this is where it\u2019s time to talk about battery life, because as much as build quality and OS choices and even 360-degree hinges matter, for a lot of people only two things really matter: price and battery life, and the Pixelbook Go might be priced weirdly, but there\u2019s no question it has some damn exceptional battery life.\n\nOur battery test is pretty simple (here are the results for the latest round of Chromebooks). We set the brightness of the display to 200 nits, turn off all the extra radios and notifications and power-draining stuff, navigate to a 24-hour video on Youtube, and play it in full screen until the computer dies. That sadly doesn\u2019t replicate how we all use our laptops (except for me on weekends), but it\u2019s how we test every laptop and it gives us a solid baseline for understanding each one.\n\nBy our metric, the Pixelbook Go has incredible battery life. On average in our test, a Chrome laptop lasts 9 hours and 6 minutes, and a Windows 10 laptop lasts 9 hours and 44 minutes. The Google Pixelbook Go lasts over 13.5 hours\u2014the only machines that beat it are wimpy Windows 10 devices with Qualcomm processors.\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkable battery life\u2014especially given that I\u2019ve been using the i5 version. The cheaper m3 version is presumably even better, and that battery life alone makes it a compelling option. There\u2019s nothing that can really compete with it in terms of weight, size, or battery life.\n\nBack at the early October event where Google introduced the device, I spoke with Google VP Phil Carmack and Senior Product Manager Ben Janfosky, and they insisted that every element of the Pixelbook Go was about creating a device that\u2019s a perfect portable machine.\n\nI don\u2019t think it quite nailed that goal. Chrome OS is a great tablet OS, and it would be nice if the Pixelbook Go made use of that strength. But it\u2019s also really light, thin, has great build quality, and it has some of the best battery life found in a laptop right now. It\u2019s not the perfect portable machine, but it comes awfully close.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a Chromebook and you can afford to spend just a little more money, the $US650 ($953) Pixelbook Go should be a laptop that lasts you for hours after the cheaper ones have died, and if the price ever drops there\u2019s no better Chromebook choice.\n\nREADME", "description": "The Pixelbook Go is the cheapest Chromebook Google has made to date.
