No explanation was given for the cancellation.\n\nIn a statement, the NBA described Mr Morey's comments as \"regrettable\" and acknowledged he had \"deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China\".\n\nIt added: \"We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force.\"\n\nHowever, on Tuesday NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared to back the Houston coach. He told a Chinese news agency that his organisation wanted to make it clear that \"Daryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression\".\n\nMr Silver added: \"I accept that it is also Chinese government's and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues.\"\n\nNBA games draw huge numbers of viewers in China, with millions watching games primarily through streaming platforms. In May this year, the NBA opened its largest store outside North America in Beijing.\n\nThe new NBA season starts on 22 October.", "description": "The row over a tweet from Houston Rockets boss Daryl Morley supporting Hong Kong protesters intensifies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1F12/production/_109145970_nbastorebeijingreuters.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
