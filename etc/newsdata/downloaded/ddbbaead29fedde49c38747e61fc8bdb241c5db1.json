Then Google has got you covered when it comes to securing your online accounts and preventing unauthorized access.\n\nThe internet giant has announced a USB-C Titan Security Key, manufactured by Yubico, that\u2019s compatible with Android, Chrome OS, macOS, and Windows devices for $40.\n\nTitan Security Keys are phishing-resistant two-factor authentication (2FA) devices from Google, designed with an intent to cryptographically verify an individual\u2019s identity while signing in to an online service, thereby defending users against account takeover attacks.\n\nGoogle already sells two other models with NFC and Bluetooth capabilities. But they were previously available only as a $50 bundle. That changes starting today, allowing users and enterprises to purchase them individually for $25 and $35 respectively.\n\niPhone or iPad users, on the other hand, may want to give Yubico\u2019s Lightning-equipped key YubiKey 5Ci a shot.\n\nNo Bluetooth support\n\nThe new security key doesn\u2019t come with Bluetooth support, which you means you can\u2019t unlock your accounts until the Titan Key is actually plugged into your device.\n\nAnd rightly so, for the Bluetooth variants suffered a hardware flaw that made it possible for an attacker to remotely hijack the keys. The problem was serious enough that it prompted Google to offer a free replacement for those who purchased them.\n\nYubico, for its part, has been consistently against offering a Bluetooth capable key, stating the product \u201cdoes not meet our standards for security, usability and durability.\u201d\n\nPasswordless authentication on the rise\n\nThe security key leverages the FIDO2 standard \u2014 developed jointly by Google and Yubico in 2012 \u2014 to provide a second layer of authentication to your login credentials. So, when you register a hardware key with an online service for the first time, it creates a public key-private key pair using asymmetric encryption.\n\nDuring authentication \u2014 using a PIN or biometrics \u2014 your identity is confirmed by encrypting a secret message with the private key and transmitting it to the online service, which decrypts the message with the public key earlier generated.\n\nThe development follows Titan Security Key\u2019s expansion to Canada, France, Japan, and the UK, and Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program for G Suite, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Cloud Identity customers back in August.\n\nStill, passwordless authentication mechanisms \u2014 such as those developed by Google and Microsoft \u2014 are yet to see widespread adoption. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the companies are integrating the features into their operating systems in hopes that it would drive users to more secure solutions.\n\n\u201cFIDO standards hold a lot of promise for enabling a more passwordless world,\u201d Jim Ducharme, VP of Identity Products, RSA told TNW. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s going to take time for the standard to be integrated across user devices, browsers, and applications and it will take even more time to be rolled out and supported by IT departments in organizations.\u201d\n\nIdentity as a service\n\nGoogle is far from the only player investing heavily in identity as a service (IDaaS). There\u2019s Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and even cellular carriers.\n\n\u201cIdentity is back on the front page, as organizations come to realize that stolen identity is the number one security issue, and often the weakest link in security postures,\u201d Ducharme told TNW.\n\nDetecting and managing identity risks, therefore, necessitates organizations to consider a risk-based authentication solution that is able to analyze user access, devices, applications and behavior to provide businesses with the confidence that users are who they say they are based on previous history.\n\nUltimately, FIDO standards are no magic bullets. They require the latest software, browsers, devices and infrastructure in order to function, requiring businesses to assess their infrastructure before going passwordless.\n\n\u201cWe are still on the journey to a truly passwordless world. Eliminating the password from the user experience during authentication is more easily achieved as we have seen with the adoption of Touch ID and Face ID,\u201d Ducharme said. \u201cWe need to move towards an approach that considers credential enrollment, recovery and how users can securely authenticate from devices that don\u2019t have integrated biometrics or FIDO capabilities.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s USB-C Titan Security Keys can be purchased on the Google Store starting later today.\n\nRead next: Facebook is reportedly locking users out for reporting fake accounts", "description": "Google has announced a USB-C Titan Security Key, manufactured by Yubico, that's compatible with Android, Chrome OS, macOS, and Windows devices for $40.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fgoogle-titan-usb-c-key-hed.png&signature=e507f402253d98d3256d4cbef40306ee", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
