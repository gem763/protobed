Ford and the UAW said earlier this month they had made \"significant progress\" in addressing many bargaining issues.\n\nFord said it looks \"forward to reaching a fair agreement that helps Ford enhance its competitiveness and preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs\".\n\nWorkers at GM will begin to go back as early as Saturday under the new four-year contract, ending the strike that cost the number-one US automaker more than two billion dollars and costing the automaker about 300,000 units of lost production. GM will attempt to make up some of that production in the coming months.\n\nThe union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers.\n\nUAW leaders had recommended that the members at GM, who have remained on the picket lines, ratify the deal reached on October 16.\n\nThe GM strike began on September 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers.\n\nThe strike at GM likely slashed at least 46,000 jobs from October's nonfarm US payrolls, the US Department Labor Department said on Friday.\n\nUnder the deal, GM will invest nine billion dollars in the US, including $7.7bn directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. The Detroit company said it will also create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which will be new, a source previously said. The contract offers $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.\n\nThe UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.", "description": "After agreeing to ratify a contract with GM, the labour union is turning to second-largest US automaker next.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/ffb892dc268a410d9e71aa3315cb924a_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
