Or is it? One day in New York City it\u2019s 67 degrees, and then the next it\u2019s pushing 90. If only the Real New York could experience the idyllic, seemingly permanent fall that the Roy family does on Succession. A fall in which sweaters don\u2019t make us sweat because we don\u2019t have to take the subway, a fall in which a long wool coat is comfortable over said sweaters.\n\nAnyway, my point is: hats off to Succession\u2019s costume designers, who clearly did their research. They know that employees in a media office (even the executives!) need sweaters because it gets cold. At Waystar Royco, this is both literal and figurative, since a \u201cfuck off!\u201d from Logan Roy can send life-threatening shivers down one\u2019s spine.\n\nSo here are the most iconic Succession sweaters, ranked. This isn\u2019t a spoiler, but it\u2019s mostly turtleneck-queen Shiv and her partner, Tom. And don\u2019t expect to see Roman on this list: His poor torso has never known the comfort of a sweater on this program.\n\n19. Shiv\u2019s oversize print in \u201cShit Show at the Fuck Factory\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nThis holiday-print kint is incredibly off-brand for Shiv. She would never be caught in this now, not even when lounging around her apartment, a thing she doesn\u2019t have time for anymore anyway! She\u2019s a She-EO in the making, and lounging is not on the itinerary. In fact, it\u2019s even a little bit off-brand for her back at the beginning of the show, which makes me wonder if she borrowed this from Tom. A man raised in the Midwest, Tom is really the only person on Succession who would own such a garment. Shiv is not \u2014 and I doubt she ever has been \u2014 the kind of person who owns an oversize knit with pine trees on it. I\u2019m sure she was grateful to Tom for lending this to her, though, because it\u2019s an ideal piece for when you\u2019re stuck in the same clothes for 48 hours and in a hospital waiting room.\n\n18. Shiv\u2019s white turtleneck, \u201cVaulter\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nWhite is a little too pure for Shiv, who is at this point a human Dementor. She looks great in this, but she doesn\u2019t look comfortable bringing this much light into the world.\n\n17. Kendall\u2019s sad sweater, \u201cNobody Is Ever Missing\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nKendall wears this heavy crewneck the morning after committing manslaughter, as one does! This looks nice but Jeremy Strong makes it look as if Kendall is wearing a sweater made of insulation that he stole from a house the Property Brothers were renovating (one with asbestos, which Rhea\u2019s dad knows all about).\n\n16. Logan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m telling my son I know about the manslaughter\u201d sweater, \u201cNobody Is Ever Missing\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nThis might be the same sweater as Logan\u2019s opening-credits one but in a different color. I also buy the same item in multiple colors when I really like it. The further I get into writing this post about Succession sweaters, the more I realize I have in common with Logan Roy. I am having an identity crisis and must take a long break during which I really think about whether I\u2019m a good person.\n\n15. Shiv\u2019s navy turtleneck, \u201cArgestes\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nShiv\u2019s formfitting navy turtleneck is the same as usual, but it\u2019s notable here because it\u2019s paired with exquisite wide-legged plaid trousers with a paper-bag waist. The image of her walking in this look with the water and mountains behind her will never escape me. Also in this look, Shiv makes a bold, correct fashion statement: Black and navy go together.\n\n14. Logan\u2019s marled-blue cardi, \u201cThe Summer Palace\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nSmug and snug. This man really has a brand.\n\n13. Greg\u2019s green cable knit, \u201cArgestes\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nCousin Greg wore beige sweaters. Cousin Gregory wears green sweaters.\n\n12. Stewy\u2019s fluffy cream turtleneck, \u201cArgestes\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nStewy\u2019s Pinterest board is obviously flooded with images of Siobhan Roy. And honestly, it works for him! The suede jacket is the real star here, though.\n\n11. Connor\u2019s marled pullover, \u201cAusterlitz\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nConnor\u2019s longing to connect with his father shows in his clothes \u2014 specifically. in his sweaters, because he tends to wear similar ones to Logan\u2019s. That\u2019s sweet and sad, but Connor is also a monster in his own way. Will he be the first president to wear a sweater for his official portrait instead of a suit? I hope we never get there.\n\n10. Tom\u2019s black turtleneck, \u201cI Went to Market\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nThe fit and structure of this constricting turtletom (a turtleneck worn by Tom Wambsgans) demonstrates how he\u2019s feeling: He\u2019s in the midst of hiding everything he knows about cruises and hiding that he\u2019s destroying the evidence of it, and he feels conflicted about both. It\u2019s a good look for Tom, but it also looks as though it cuts off his circulation in the neck, arms, and waist. I just want poor, horrible Tom to give up and go back to the Twin Cities to live the rest of his days in oversize turtletoms knitted by his mother.\n\n9. Willa in Connor\u2019s pullover, \u201cAusterlitz\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nWilla is wearing the same gray pullover Connor wears earlier in this episode. What a disturbing act of affection for her \u2026 boss. Depressingly (???), Willa happens to look great in this.\n\n8. Greg\u2019s Thanksgiving cable knit, \u201cI Went to Market\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nThis cable knit is appropriate for the occasion, which is shredding evidence of crime cover-ups on cruises on Thanksgiving Day. This sweater is probably from the Gap, and we love that for Greg.\n\n7. Shiv\u2019s ribbed gray turtleneck, \u201cThe Summer Palace\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nThe ribbed turtleneck adds some unexpected texture for Siobhan. When in the Hamptons, I guess? I have lived in New York City for six years and have never been, so I do not know what people wear in the Hamptons, particularly in fall or winter. But this feels appropriate. When it gets colder, I will purchase a cheaper version of this top from Forever 21 \u2014 I apologize in advance.\n\n6. Tom\u2019s weekend-retreat cardi, \u201cTern Haven\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nTom\u2019s textured gray sweater provides all the warmth I wish I could give to him personally. As season two goes on, his clothes get a bit darker \u2014 he\u2019s opting for cloudy grays over the brighter beiges he used to wear. His descent into darkness is rapid, and we can only hope Cousin Gregory pulls him out.\n\n5. Logan\u2019s opening credits sweater\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nLogan Roy\u2019s affinity for chunky cable knits is his one and only redeeming quality. It\u2019s not fair \u2014 he\u2019s a monster, but he gets to slip into cashmere whenever he wants? This sable cardigan is Logan\u2019s go-to office sweater. He\u2019s wearing it in a Waystar boardroom at the end of the show\u2019s opening credits, and he wears it in several office scenes in seasons one and two. Like most women, Logan has a go-to sweater at the office throughout the year, which I\u2019m sad to say is incredibly relatable. Someone needs to turn up the temperature on the executive floor because Logan Roy does not deserve the sweaters he owns.\n\n4. Geri\u2019s blanket sweater, \u201cHunting\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nGeri, 100 percent goddess, glides around the morning after Boar on the Floor in this divine camel blanket sweater. Even after a \u201cfruity\u201d evening surrounded by backstabbing fools, Geri prioritizes comfort.\n\n3. Shiv\u2019s black turtleneck, \u201cVaulter\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nSiobhan Roy was born wearing a body-conscious turtleneck and a gold-coin necklace.\n\n2. Tom\u2019s Hamptons chunky knit, \u201cThe Summer Palace\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nAhh, another turtletom! He\u2019s finally feeling a little more comfortable breaking out his Midwestern style around the Roys. You really do love to see it. This chunky monkey is a vision on Tom Wambsgans.\n\n1. Shiv\u2019s backless turtleneck, \u201cDundee\u201d\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nFrom the front, this is a standard sweater. Shiv Roy in yet another formfitting turtleneck \u2026 typical! But as the camera moves unpredictably because of all the improv on this program, you realize there\u2019s something different about this top. Shiv is all covered in front, but you can sort of see her shoulders? And \u2014 oh my God \u2014 her entire back is bare, \u00e0 la Hilary Swank\u2019s 2005 Oscars dress.\n\nPhoto: HBO\n\nHow does it stay up? Who cares. This orgasmic Shiv staple says \u201cFuck off!\u201d to having a back. I request a diagram of how the costume department taped her boobs.", "description": "Hats off to Succession\u2019s costume designers, who clearly did their research: They know that employees in a media office (even the executives!) need sweaters because it gets cold.", "authors": ["Carrie Wittmer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/30/succession-sweaters/30-succession-sweaters-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
