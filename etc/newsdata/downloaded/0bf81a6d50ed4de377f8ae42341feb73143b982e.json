(AP) \u2014 Charlie Brewer threw for 230 yards and a touchdown and Baylor beat Kansas State 31-12 on Saturday to remain undefeated.\n\nThe Bears (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) had 426 yards of offense with only 23 minutes of possession against the Wildcats (3-2, 0-2), who have scored only two touchdowns in their last two games.\n\nJohn Lovett had a pair of touchdown runs and Gerry Bohanon added another scoring run for Baylor. Tyquan Thornton had 92 yards receiving with a touchdown. Denzel Mims hauled in 83 yards on five catches and JaMycal Hasty had 87 yards rushing.\n\nSkylar Thompson was 22-of-34 passing for 218 yards for Kansas State. James Gilbert led the Wildcats in rushing with 94 yards.\n\nThe Wildcats' Blake Lynch kicked a 31-yard field goal with two minutes left in the first quarter. Baylor responded on the ensuing drive with a John Mayers 36-yard field goal to tie the game at 3-3 just 30 seconds into the second.\n\nBrewer found Thornton wide open in the end zone for 29 yards, capping a 98-yard drive to give the Bears a 10-3 halftime advantage. It was the second straight game that Kansas State has scored just a field goal in the first half.\n\nLovett scored on a 13-yard run early in the second half that made it 17-3. The Wildcats were driving on the following possession but fumbled at the Bears 30 and thwarted any potential momentum.\n\nThompson threw his first interception of the season, and the Bears answered with a 63-yard drive, capped by Bohanon's 4-yard touchdown run that made it 24-6 with 10 minutes to go.\n\nWith six minutes left, Thompson tossed a 5-yard TD to Dalton Schoen, but the 2-point conversion failed.\n\nLovett ran for a 46-yard touchdown two plays later.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nBaylor has won its first five games of the season and look to be a contender in the Big 12 this season.\n\nKansas State looks vulnerable after starting the season 3-0 as their offense has gone stagnant in conference play.\n\nALTERNATIVE UNIFORMS\n\nKansas State wore alternative uniforms for the first time in 30 years, with white pants and white helmets.\n\nINJURY WATCH\n\nBaylor quarterback Charlie Brewer was injured early in the fourth quarter and didn't return to the game. Brewer has thrown for 11 touchdowns without an interception this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBaylor will return home to take on Texas Tech on Saturday.\n\nKansas State has their second bye week before hosting TCU on October 19.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
