But it is not intended to replace M1 or M2 money,\" Yi said, according to a full transcript of his speech published online.\n\nIn August, another PBOC official, Mu Changchun, said in a forum that the timing was almost ripe for the introduction of a central bank digital currency in China after five years of study.\n\nMu, who took the position as the new head of central bank's digital currency research institute in September 6, made claims earlier this month that the Chinese central bank's digital currency has the best \"legitimacy and security\".\n\nTencent's WeChat payment and Ant Financial's Alipay, the two popular mobile payment methods in China, will not be affected by the digital currency as the introduction of a digital token would replace the cash currently settled by the Chinese banks.\n\nMobile payments have been extremely popular in China, the government has nevertheless been tightening its grip on digital currencies like Bitcoin. China prohibited local financial institutions from handling Bitcoin transactions in late 2013.\n\nChina has also started clamping down on cryptocurrency trading. It banned Initial Coin Offerings in late 2017 and closed down more than 100 cryptocurrency exchange platforms last year.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nChina could soon ban cryptocurrency mining: Report\n\nThe South China Morning Post has reported the country's economic planning body is moving to ban cryptocurrency mining facilities.\n\nCryptocurrency: Reasons to be skeptical (TechRepublic)\n\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrency, let the buyer beware and be aware, says TechRepublic's Brandon Vigliarolo.\n\nNew ransomware strain is locking up Bitcoin mining rigs in China\n\nRansomware threatens to overheat and destroy mining rigs if victims don't infect 1,000 other devices or don't pay a 10 Bitcoin ransom.\n\nCryptocurrency mining malware is the number one malware menace - again\n\nCryptojackers like CoinHive top Check Point's 'most wanted' malware list \u2013 but Smoke Loader's first entry points to what might be to come.\n\nCryptocurrency market to explode due to fast transaction speeds, enterprise investment (TechRepublic)\n\nThe cryptocurrency market will grow at a CAGR of 31% between 2017 and 2025, according to Transparency Market Research.", "description": "Earlier remarks from a Chinese central bank official had indicated that China was ready to launch its own digital currency.", "authors": ["Cyrus Lee"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/08/22/f990b69d-75f2-4d8e-8498-2233d164322b/thumbnail/770x578/06bd60e2af7b31f0434c380cdf488148/it-budgets-2019-intro-header.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
