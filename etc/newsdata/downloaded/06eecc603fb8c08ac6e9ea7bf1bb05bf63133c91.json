The 25-year-old Kenyan ran 2:14:04 to beat Radcliffe\u2019s best of 2:15:25 by an astonishing 81 seconds.\n\nMo Farah records worst marathon time as Lawrence Cherono wins in Chicago Read more\n\nThe whispers all week in Chicago had been that Kosgei was intending to make a serious assault on Radcliffe\u2019s time. In cold and sunny conditions \u2013 perfect for the marathon \u2013 she knew the attempt was on, especially when the winds died down on Sunday morning.\n\nKosgei immediately set out her stall by going through five miles in 25:10, way inside world record pace. Some feared that she had massively overcooked her pace and would eventually boil over. But even though Kosgei slowed her pace she still went through halfway in 66.59, over a minute faster than Radcliffe\u2019s time in setting her world record in 2003.\n\nThere appeared to be a moment where Kosgei did not seem to be quite as comfortable, but when she ran the five kilometers between 25 and 30 km in 15:45 pace it was clear that she the record was in her grasp. And so it proved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kenya\u2019s Brigid Kosgei crosses the finish line.

They include Asbel Kiprop, the former world 1500m champion, Jemima Sumgong, the 2016 London marathon and Olympic champion, and Rita Jeptoo, who won this race in 2013. However there is no suggestion of wrongoing by Kosgei or Rosa.\n\nSome will also point out that Kosgei was wearing the Nike Next% training shoes, which have been estimated to give between 60-90 seconds of performance benefit over other shoes. But on a stunning day in Chicago few appeared to care about that as she blasted into history.", "description": "Paula Radcliffe\u2019s world marathon record, which has stood imperiously for over 16 years, has been obliterated by Brigid Kosgei at the Chicago marathon", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54d4b707ec21923410681f39a0efba58a3b7e2ec/241_95_2716_1630/master/2716.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e6b0abbde22540cd140fae6c4736300", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
