Buying candy may seem the simplest of all preparations, but anyone who has trick-or-treated knows that what you give out can leave a lasting impression. Sure, you can swing by Duane Reade at 4 p.m. on the 31st \u2014 but is the possibility of answering the door with nothing more than Dum Dums really worth the risk? We think not. So we reached out to food writers and local parents who live in popular trick-or-treating neighborhoods to ask about the candy they\u2019re using to stand out this Halloween. We also talked to some kids themselves about the candy they\u2019re most excited to score. Read on for what they told us is shaping up to be the status candy of Halloween 2019.\n\nThis year\u2019s status Halloween candy: Tony\u2019s Chocolonely Bar\n\nSince the people you are really trying to impress with your status candy are trick-or-treating kids (and, in turn, their parents), we found it telling that our kid sources all agreed on one thing that separates status from standard candy: the size of the bars. Liz Gumbinner, publisher and editor-in-chief of Cool Mom Picks, says that her kids consider \u201cfull-size anything\u201d a big Halloween score, and her 14-year-old confirmed that nothing beats receiving a full-size candy bar. Isaac, the 12-year-old son of Didn\u2019t I Just Feed You podcast co-host Stacie Billis, agrees. And Pam Frederick, a mom and the editor and owner of Tribeca Citizen, told us that for her kid, bigger is always better. \u201cMy kid says the best thing is a full-size bar, and the worst thing is a toothbrush or a protein bar,\u201d she told us.\n\nMitchell Cohen, owner of Economy Candy on the Lower East Side, also says that full-size bars are the most impressive. \u201cI have had many people start shifting to full-size candy bars,\u201d he explains. And when it comes to the full-size bar to give, Cohen names one you might not have heard of, from Tony\u2019s Chocolonely, which he says has become a fast favorite among his customers. \u201cPeople buy handfuls at a time,\u201d he told us, admitting he\u2019s a Tony\u2019s fan himself. \u201cThey are delicious and very popular.\u201d Cohen said he and his wife found the Dutch-made chocolate last year while visiting Amsterdam, where they made a point to track the bars down. \u201cI personally recommend them to customers and then they become hooked,\u201d he adds. Food writer Danyelle Freeman says that she also came across the company while in Amsterdam, and that it has a do-good approach to business that may appeal to parents as much as the candy appeals to kids. \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about Tony\u2019s Chocolonely is that it\u2019s not only legitimately delicious, but the company is on a mission to end slavery and child labor on cocoa farms,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favorite chocolate-bar flavors are the dark milk pretzel toffee and milk honey almond nougat.\u201d The brand\u2019s fair-trade practices \u2014 which it says include making chocolate without slave labor \u2014 means its chocolate bars come at a slightly higher price point, but Tony\u2019s also makes a less-expensive candy that the budget-conscious might consider (more on that below). Tony\u2019s Chocolonely first crossed The Strategist\u2019s radar when some bars landed in our office earlier this year. Managing editor Maxine Builder, who took a deep dive into status chocolate bars for the Strategist, describes them as \u201cthat same sweet, sweet chocolate bar you treasured as a kid, just made with nicer ingredients.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s (less expensive) status Halloween candy: Tiny Tony\u2019s chocolate coins\n\nTony's Chocolonely Tiny Tony's Halloween Milk Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel Bag If you\u2019re expecting an army of trick-or-treaters at your doorstep this Halloween, you might consider stocking up on Tiny Tony\u2019s Milk Caramel Sea Salt Coins, a new offering from Tony\u2019s Chocolonely for this Halloween season. The bite-size chocolate coins are individually wrapped in festive orange packaging for the holiday, making them an excellent alternative to the full-size bars. Alyssa Shelasky, author of Apron Anxiety: My Messy Affairs in and Out of the Kitchen and a writer for Grub Street and the Cut, is a fan. \u201cFor some reason I feel like Tony\u2019s Chocolonely is having a moment,\u201d she told us, noting that the chocolate-caramel coins are \u201cso freaking good.\u201d She adds that \u201cI\u2019m planning to give out the Tony\u2019s Chocolonely new Halloween Tiny Tony\u2019s because I tried them, they\u2019re to die for, and they\u2019re just slightly more sophisticated than some of the other crap.\u201d Facialist and foodie Chelsea Hunter Harrison, who first came across Tony\u2019s at a health-food store, feels similarly about the chocolates. \u201cThey are perfect,\u201d she says, adding that she plans to hand out the coins this Halloween, too, partly to share the brand\u2019s slave-free chocolate mission. \u201cThe price of chocolate is artificially low due to slavery and unethical labor, making chocolate feel disposable \u2026 I actually prefer spending more for some Tony\u2019s to remember the value of chocolate \u2014 that a lot of work goes into it.\u201d Strategist senior writer Karen Iorio Adelson, who tried the milk-chocolate sea-salt coins and \u201cimmediately fell in love,\u201d describes them as having an \u201caddictive salty-sweet taste that makes them more approachable than a bitter, extra-dark chocolate bar,\u201d while still \u201ctasting richer and more buttery than your standard drugstore candy.\u201d $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nMore worthy candy to give this Halloween\n\nHershey's Halloween Chocolate Candy, Glow in the Dark Wrapped Variety Mix Sometimes, no matter how well-intentioned you are about prepping, you wind up scrambling at your local drugstore hours before the hordes invade your stoop. Should this happen to you, our experts say you can still walk out with candy that will impress trick-or-treaters, and suggest grabbing some classic candies with wrappers that glow in the dark. \u201cI\u2019m a food lover (and writer) at heart, so I won\u2019t stock my bowl with any old drugstore candy,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cThough I do think the glow-in-the-dark Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups and Hershey\u2019s Milk Chocolate bars are fun to light up the big, spooky night.\u201d Alexa Suskin, a mom of three who lives in Cobble Hill (a popular neighborhood for trick-or-treating and impressive decorations), told us \u201cMy husband and I joke that we have an extra candy tax that we should build into our budget for the amount of candy we give away.\u201d Given the number of trick-or-treaters who come through her neighborhood, she\u2019s usually looking for inexpensive fun-size options, and the glow-in-the-dark minis are on her radar for this year, as well. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nFor a couple of other foodie-approved drugstore options, Freeman likes these chocolates from Kit Kit and Hershey\u2019s that are only sold around Halloween. \u201cIf you only had time to stop at your local Walgreens or CVS, my vote would be pumpkin-pie Kit Kats or Hershey\u2019s caramel-apple-filled milk chocolates,\u201d she says. (For something more upscale, Freeman says \u201cyou could head to Dylan\u2019s Candy Bar and gift candy kebabs or mini candy cauldrons filled with gummy worms.\u201d)\n\nJustin's Nut Butter Mini Peanut Butter Cups Gumbinner told us that she and other in-the-know adults like giving out Justin\u2019s organic peanut-butter cups \u2014 mostly because the peanut-butter cups (which are kind of a \u201chealthier\u201d take on Reese\u2019s) are delicious, but also because, like Tony\u2019s Chocolonely, the brand promises it is socially and environmentally conscious. Laura Fenton, a writer/editor and the lifestyle director at Parents Magazine, agrees that Justin\u2019s peanut-butter cups are a popular candy to give, but she prefers the brand\u2019s mini version. \u201cI\u2019d be thrilled if my neighbors were passing out Justin\u2019s Mini Dark Chocolate Peanut-Butter Cups, so I could steal them from my kid\u2019s stash,\u201d she says. Each bag in this six-pack includes individually wrapped mini peanut-butter cups that would be easy to hand out on Halloween. $47 for 6 at Amazon Buy $47 for 6 at Amazon Buy\n\nKit Kat White Creme Wafer Bars Candy When we asked our kid sources what specific candy they hoped to receive in full-size form, Gumbinner\u2019s 14-year-old told us that \u201cwhite-chocolate Kit Kats are the best.\u201d While we\u2019re sure the trick-or-treaters at your door would be thrilled to receive a full size, the white-chocolate wafers are available in mini form, too. $28 for 24 at Amazon Buy $28 for 24 at Amazon Buy\n\nCharleston Chew Bar For another kid we talked to, the best full-size status candy bar is the one that requires a hunt. 12-year-old Isaac told us that his most coveted full-size bar is a Charleston Chew because \u201cthey\u2019re rare and hard to find \u2014 they\u2019re like antiques.\u201d $38 for 24 at Amazon Buy $38 for 24 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
