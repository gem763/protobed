But they don\u2019t, on either of those points. Either they are intellectually incapable of discussion beyond a Neanderthal \u201cfire bad\u201d level, or they are simply of poor character and profoundly dishonest, and dare I say, evil people. Likely both.\n\nThe journey matters less than the destination in this case, because the destination, whichever path is taken to get there, is profoundly dangerous and wholly un-American. This was on full display this past week, from coast to coast.\n\nOut on the left coast, actors Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, in the tradition of their ideological forefathers, want a list of anyone in Hollywood who happens to support President Trump.\n\nMcCormack tweeted a Hollywood Reporter story about a fundraiser the Ppesident is attending in Beverly Hills, asking the outlet to \u201ckindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don\u2019t wanna work with.\u201d Messing followed shortly thereafter with a similar request.\n\nThe two who, were it not for the luck of having an old hit TV show and \u201cmailbox money\u201d thanks to syndication, would be struggling actors appearing in cameos in forgettable straight-to-cable movies (seriously, check out their IMDB pages and see if you\u2019ve ever heard of anything else they\u2019ve done) would be willing to work with anyone in order to make ends meet.\n\nBut the success they did have went to their heads, and their millions allow them to advocate for blacklisting people they view as their enemies for thinking differently than they do. They\u2019re Hitlerific!\n\nThe people who don\u2019t have that luxury are the people who make sure they look good on camera, the stage hands who make sure they aren\u2019t crushed by a collapsing set, the people who make sure there is food on set, etc. In other words, the \u201clittle people\u201d they claim to care about. Not only do they not have millions and \u201cmailbox money,\u201d they\u2019re also likely to be the type of people Messing and McCormack wouldn\u2019t work with if they ever found out what they really think about things like taxes, illegal immigration, socialized medicine, and all the rest.\n\nThanks to the Gestapo tactics of the two lead actors on \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d they now have crew members and co-stars terrified their thoughts will be uncovered.\n\nThat\u2019s their real goal \u2013 conformity or silence. At least while they\u2019re out of power. Should they ever gain power\u2026the sky is the limit.\n\nBut McCormack and Messing aren\u2019t alone in the Hollywood-Holier-Than-Thou crowd. Another marginal talent living off memories and royalties of their past work is Alyssa Milano. She\u2019s \u201cfighting\u201d on behalf of people who didn\u2019t ask her to fight for them, who don\u2019t need or want what she\u2019s \u201cfighting\u201d for. She, like Tweedledum and Tweetledumber, know what\u2019s best for others. After all, they watch MSNBC.\n\nMilano tweeted, \u201cI know some of you dislike me. But understand...I\u2019m fighting for you, too. That you might be free to be you. That you might not have to work so hard to put food on the table. That you can control your own destiny free from discrimination. That you can live...just live.\u201d Essentially, \u201cShut up, you ingrates, socialism is for your own good.\u201d\n\nThe collective IQ of these three is about that of the average person\u2019s shoe size, yet their ability to terrify people they work with is unlimited. None are A-list actors, but they\u2019re likely the biggest name on any project they\u2019re hired for. And you don\u2019t work on a set very long if the \u201cstar\u201d wants you gone. Producers just make up an excuse and you\u2019re gone. A nice, clean kill.\n\nOn the other coast, Hollywood for ugly people, the anti-Republican forces claimed two more scalps.\n\nSome \u201cjournalist\u201d decided to violate the concept of \u201coff the record\u201d and tell people what the president\u2019s personal assistant allegedly said over a night out with reporters. Why Madeleine Westerhout trusted reporters in the first place is a testament to the nature of power in Washington. If you are not one of them, they are not your friend. No matter how nice they may be, you are a vessel to advancing their agenda and careers, nothing more. She learned that the hard way by reportedly saying the sorts of things everyone says about their boss at some point and finding it in print soon after.\n\nAnother fascistic guttersnipe with a press pass, a guy named Ben Penn, had himself a \u201cscoop!\u201d He found an anti-Semitic Facebook post by a Trump appointee in the Department of Labor. Only it wasn\u2019t anti-Semitic, it was a sarcastic joke mocking anti-Semites. You\u2019d have to have suffered a serious closed-head injury to not see that, or be a true-believing Brownshirt.\n\nJust a few days after journalists were up in arms over the idea of Trump supporters exposing past racist and anti-Semitic social media posts by journalists, saying it was a threat (somehow) to democracy, another progressive Jihadi claimed his scalp and the target of this Bloomberg labor and employment \u201creporter,\u201d a man named Leif Olson, was forced to resign over the lie.\n\nIn his acceptance speech for accolades and his Iron Cross, he told the bloodthirsty mob, \u201cLost in all of this is that Olson was part of a team of political appointees tasked with the heavy lift of drafting wage-hour regulations that are high priorities for Trump White House, business community. They're now down one adviser.\u201d It was a scalp with purpose, and he, and his bosses at Bloomberg, are proud of it. (UPDATE: After this column was written, Olson got his job back.)\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember, the left is out for blood. They are not your friend. If you refuse to conform, to get in line and shut up, they will happily destroy you. This is what they do when they\u2019re out of power, just imagine what they\u2019d do if they won.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "I\u2019m not a fan of tossing around the word \u201cNazi.\u201d .09/05/2019 0:14:11AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/215/8682a976-1a80-4094-883b-a56f28ec6783.jpg"}
