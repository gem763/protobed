Just keeping up with them was an incredibly hard task,\u201d said Hamilton.\n\nMercedes\u2019s victory was their sixth in a row in Sochi, the team having won every Russian Grand Prix since the first in 2014.\n\nIt was also the 82nd of Hamilton\u2019s career, and ninth of the season, leaving him nine short of Michael Schumacher\u2019s all-time record of 91.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a long time coming, it feels like the first time as well,\u201d said the 34-year-old after his first win since Hungary on the eve of the August break.\n\n\u201cHonestly I try not to think too much about the championship. One race at a time and one step at a time... one foot in front of the other. We don\u2019t want to stumble.\u201d\n\nHAT-TRICK OF WINS\n\nFerrari had arrived in Sochi after a hat-trick of wins and with a hefty speed advantage, looking set for another triumph after Leclerc seized pole position for the fourth race in a row.\n\nBut there was controversy after Leclerc allowed Vettel, third on the grid, to slipstream down the long straight and lead into turn two while Hamilton suffered wheelspin and fell to third.\n\nRelated Coverage Team by team analysis of the Russian Formula One Grand Prix\n\nThe agreement was for the German to hand back the place once Ferrari had settled into a one-two formation but instead Vettel began banging in a series of fastest laps.\n\n\u201cSebastian will let you by next lap,\u201d the 21-year-old was told over the radio on lap four but the four-times world champion refused to ease off.\n\nLeclerc, already smarting after being undone in Singapore by a strategy that worked in Vettel\u2019s favour, again made his feelings clear over the team radio.\n\n\u201cYou put me behind. I respected everything,\u201d he said as Vettel, winner in Singapore after more than a year off the top of the podium, pulled away.\n\n\u201cI respected. I gave him the slipstream,\u201d he added later, with Ferrari telling him they were switching to \u2018Plan C\u2019 and a later swap.\n\nLeclerc pitted from second on lap 23 and came back out in fourth. Vettel made his stop three laps later, with the Monegasque making up the place while Hamilton led for a record 143rd race.\n\nTwo laps later Vettel coasted to a halt by the side of the track with an apparent motor generator problem, and the virtual safety car (VSC) period gave Hamilton the chance to take a free pitstop and return ahead of Leclerc.\n\nLeclerc pitted again on lap 31 when the real safety car was deployed as the VSC period was ending after George Russell crashed in his Williams. The Ferrari resumed in third but was unable to pass Bottas.\n\nSAFETY CAR\n\nThe real safety car made two appearances, the first after an opening lap collision between Haas\u2019s Romain Grosjean, Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo and Alfa Romeo\u2019s Antonio Giovinazzi, who appeared to be tagged by Racing Point\u2019s Lance Stroll.\n\nRicciardo limped back to the pits with a puncture but retired on lap 26, while Grosjean was pitched into the barriers and out of the race.\n\nRed Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen and Alexander Albon, who started from the pit lane after a crash in qualifying and engine penalties, finished fourth and fifth.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nSpaniard Carlos Sainz was sixth for McLaren, with Racing Point\u2019s Mexican Sergio Perez seventh and McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris eighth.\n\nKevin Magnussen bagged two points for Haas, despite collecting a five second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage, with Nico Hulkenberg 10th for Renault.\n\nMercedes now lead Ferrari in the constructors\u2019 standings by 162 points.", "description": "Formula One leader Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Grand Prix in a surprise Mercedes one-two on Sunday after Ferrari tripped over team orders and were undone by a virtual safety car they triggered.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435227976&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0KP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
