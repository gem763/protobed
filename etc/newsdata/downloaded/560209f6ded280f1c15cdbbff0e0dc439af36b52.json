Body has said Marquis Jefferson is not Atatiana\u2019s legal or biological father, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\nLee Merritt, the attorney representing some relatives, said on Twitter that the Saturday funeral\u2014which was to feature prominent civil rights activists\u2014would still happen.\n\nBoth sides are due in court Monday morning for a hearing.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, 28, was gunned down in her Fort Worth home on Oct. 12 after a neighbor called police to check on an open door in the dead of night.\n\nHer 8-year-old nephew told authorities she heard someone outside, got a gun out of her purse and pointed it at the window, fearing an intruder, according to court documents.\n\nBodycam footage shows Officer Aaron Dean shouting at her to put her hands up before opening fire within seconds; it\u2019s not clear if he saw the weapon.\n\nDean resigned from the police force the next day and has since been charged with murder.\n\n\u201cI get it. We are trying to do better... anyone who had looked at that video saw it was wrong,\u201d Fort Worth Police Chief Ed Kraus told reporters earlier in the week.", "description": "A man identified as her father on her death certificate got a judge to issue a restraining order to stop the services and burial.", "authors": ["Tracy Connor", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1099,w_1955,x_0,y_217/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571451057/atatiana_1_fozwuc", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
