Neither France nor Germany has so far said who it believed was responsible.\n\nThe prime minister was also due to hold bilateral talks with Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, on Tuesday, where he will discuss the Saudi attack and the continued detention of UK-Iran dual nationals including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.\n\nSpeaking on the plane Johnson said one of his key objectives at UNGA was to help \u201cbring the world together in response to what happened in Saudi Arabia, in our management of Iran\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can tell you that the UK is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the Aramco attacks. We think it very likely indeed that Iran was indeed responsible, using both drones and cruise missiles.\n\n\u201cClearly, the difficulty is how do we organise a global response, what is the way forward. We\u2019ll be working with our American friends and our European friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region.\u201d\n\nJohnson went on: \u201cOn what kind of action we can take, you\u2019ll have seen that the Americans are proposing to do more to help to defend Saudi Arabia, and we will be following that closely.\n\n\u201cAnd clearly, if we are asked, either by the Saudis or by the Americans, to have a role then we will consider what way we could be useful.\u201d\n\nQuestioned whether this meant a response could involve UK military forces, he said: \u201cWe will consider in what way we can be useful, if asked, depending on what the exact plan is.\u201d\n\nBut he declined to specify any possible action, saying on the idea of tighter sanctions: \u201cThere is certainly a case for responding together, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a British government official told reporters that the Houthi\u2019s claim to have carried out the attack was \u201cimplausible\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cImagery from the site of the attack shows remnants of Iranian-made ground-attack cruise missiles. The scale, sophistication and range of the attack is inconsistent with the Houthi\u2019s capability.\u201d", "description": "En route to the UN general assembly in New York, prime minister raises possibility that the British military could become involved", "authors": ["Peter Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef443f2fc249c36a337bdf6b5038b17561233588/24_0_3451_2073/master/3451.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=72ddd2203fe00bd655f8fc6559f69a84", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
