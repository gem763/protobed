REUTERS/Gleb Garanich\n\nIn an interview with media outlet Hromadske, Prystaiko said Ukraine was an independent state and would not take sides in U.S. politics even if \u201cin theory\u201d the country was in a position to do so. He added that Kiev appreciated the assistance it received from Washington.\n\nOn Friday reports by U.S. media outlets said Trump repeatedly pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden, one of Trump\u2019s chief political rivals, in a July phone call.\n\nThe call featured in a classified whistleblower complaint that has sparked a political battle between Democrats warning of a national security threat and Republicans turning it into an attack on Biden, a frontrunner in the field of Democrats seeking to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nReuters has not confirmed details of the whistleblower\u2019s complaint. But a source familiar with the matter said it alleged \u201cmultiple acts\u201d by Trump, not just a phone call with a foreign leader. The source requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nZelenskiy\u2019s office has so far declined to comment on the allegations.\n\n\u201cI know what the conversation was about and I think there was no pressure,\u201d Prystaiko said. \u201cThis conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\u201d\n\nTrump dismissed the Sept. 12 complaint from the whistleblower within the intelligence community as a partisan hit against him.\n\nTrump had spoken Zelenskiy less than three weeks before the complaint was filed. Trump is due to meet Zelenskiy during a United Nations gathering in New York.\n\nPrystaiko said Zelenskiy had the right to keep conversations with other leaders confidential.\n\n\u201cI want to say that we are an independent state, we have our secrets,\u201d he was quoted as saying in the interview.\n\nThe July 25 call between the leaders is under investigation by three Democratic-led House committees, who want to know if Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into aiding Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Trump urged Zelenskiy about eight times during the call to work with Giuliani to investigate Biden and Biden\u2019s son.", "description": "Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko on Saturday denied suggestions U.S. President Donald Trump had put pressure on Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a phone call in July.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432374970&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0LC", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
