The club is still a haven for talented Brazilian players and Luis Castro, their Portuguese coach, will have 10 to select from when they face Manchester City \u2014 as well as as the Santos-born striker J\u00fanior Moraes, who received Ukrainian citizenship in March, and the former S\u00e3o Paulo player Marlos, who made his Ukraine debut in October 2017.\n\nBrand\u00e3o, signed from modest Iraty in 2002, blazed the trail and 34 \u2013 most recently the Brazil Under-20 captain Vit\u00e3o \u2013 have followed him, with often spectacular results. Signings Brazilians became a specific strategy when the Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu, keen to create a more technical team and aided by the financial backing of the billionaire president Rinat Akhmetov, arrived in 2004. If the prospect of playing in Ukraine was not always an immediately easy sell, the money on offer helped and so did the fact that new arrivals would be playing alongside a cluster of their countrymen. European football meant exposure elsewhere and the prospect that, if they succeeded at Shakhtar, opportunities with bigger names might open up.\n\nShakhtar\u2019s plan, which has just about survived Lucescu\u2019s departure in 2016 and the turbulent political climate, has paid off handsomely for all parties. They would not have achieved Akhmetov\u2019s dream of a European title had it not been for the five Brazilians in their Uefa Cup-winning side of 2009 \u2013 including Luiz Adriano and J\u00e1dson, the scorers of their goals in the final against Werder Bremen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shakhtar Donetsk\u2019s Dario Srna (left) holds the Uefa Cup beside teammates Adriano Luiz (centre) and J\u00e1dson upon their arrival at Donetsk airport in May 2009 after defeating Werder Bremen in Istanbul.

Ahead of him, on the left flank, was Willian. Players such as Douglas Costa, Bernard and Fred have also moved on to bigger leagues, albeit with wildly differing results, while the channel with Manchester City was established when they sold Elano for \u00a38m in 2007. The present crop have their work cut out to emulate those players\u2019 successes but nights like this evening are the kind that can change a career trajectory.\n\nThe cream of the present-day crop\n\nTet\u00ea\n\nThe 19-year-old winger is well placed to be Shakhtar\u2019s next big thing. He had not played a game for Gr\u00eamio when he arrived for \u00a313.5m in February after two tricky months of negotiations but his impact was almost instant. In his fifth appearance he scored Shakhtar\u2019s first two goals in the Ukrainian cup final against Inhulets, both poached from close in, and a well-taken finish against Dynamo Kyiv seven days later \u2013 securing a draw that effectively sealed the title \u2013 confirmed his appetite for the big occasion. This season he has scored twice and there is no doubt that, when cutting inside on to his left foot, a player known in Brazil as \u201cthe hurricane\u201d poses a major threat from the right flank. \u201cWe believe he\u2019s our future, that Tet\u00ea will grow into a big star,\u201d said the Shakhtar CEO, Sergei Palkin, who sees him as part of a \u201cnew Shakhtar\u201d that could contain the spine of Brazil\u2019s next team and accepts he may require two years to blossom. A \u20ac150m release clause is in place to deter anyone who fancies nurturing Tet\u00ea before then.\n\nTaison\n\nTaison looked sure to be Shakhtar\u2019s latest high-profile Brazilian export when, late in the summer transfer window, the club began talks with Milan. But the deal fell through, apparently on Shakhtar\u2019s refusal to sell or loan him for anything below his \u20ac30m release clause, and the 31-year-old\u2019s frustration showed when he posted \u201cCongratulations on ending my dream\u201d on Instagram. There are suggestions Milan may return in the winter but Taison appears to have put his disappointment to one side, scoring a clinical goal against Zorya Luhansk on Saturday. He moved to Ukraine almost a decade ago, joining the now-defunct Metalist Kharkiv and showing an appetite for the spectacular during their ill-fated rise. His past six years have been spent with Shakhtar and Manchester United are among those to have been punished by his eye for goal. Eight Brazil caps, and a place in their World Cup squad, were just reward for his brilliance but the chance to play in one of the world\u2019s biggest leagues may have slipped away.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shakhtar Donetsk\u2019s Taison celebrates after scoring their second goal in last season\u2019s Champions League Group game against TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA-EFE\n\nMarcos Ant\u00f3nio\n\nHe may not capture the attention as quickly as Tet\u00ea but the diminutive midfielder, who joined from Portuguese second-tier side Estoril Praia for \u00a33m a few weeks before his compatriot\u2019s arrival, is already attracting glances elsewhere. Like Tet\u00ea, Marcos Antonio is 19 and a Brazil Under-20 international; he has made similar inroads into the first team, showing an impressive tendency to open up the play from deep. His first goal for the club, against Mariupol last month, came after a lung-busting run beyond the backline to get on the end of a move he had begun. The sense is that he has more potential than his 22-year-old midfield colleague Maycon, who is injured. Some onlookers have compared him to Fred \u2013 presumably the version that shone at Shakhtar \u2013 but Marcos Ant\u00f3nio cites Casemiro and Philippe Coutinho as inspirations. Emulating them both might sound a tall order but any player who can become a blend of the two will have the world at his feet.\n\nShakhtar\u2019s nine other Brazilian imports\n\nDentinho (30, forward), Alan Patrick (28, midfielder), Maycon (22, midfielder), Marquinhos Cipriano (20, forward), Ismaily (29, left-back), Vit\u00e3o (19, centre-back), Dodo (20, right-back), Marlos (Ukr/Braz, 31, forward), J\u00fanior Moraes (Ukr/Braz, 32, forward)", "description": "The Ukrainian club has long been a haven for Brazilians and three stand out as they start their Champions League campaign", "authors": ["Nick Ames"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d225667cfc57f6a3a9c637d6fc4222e919dfc236/0_125_4091_2455/master/4091.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7c1df49bc89096396ee8bca1fbd1a10", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
