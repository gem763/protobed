Forty-nine police cars were damaged, 41 metro stations vandalized and 308 people were detained.\n\nSporting and cultural events have been canceled for the weekend, the metro network remains closed and foreign embassies have updated their security advisories for expatriates and visitors, urging them to avoid crowds and carry identification.\n\nIn just over three weeks, Chile is due to host U.S. President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping along with many others for a regional summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Weeks later it will host other world leaders for the COP25 United Nations climate change summit.\n\nThe decision to deploy the military was met with widespread shock in a nation that lived under a military dictatorship for 17 years until 1990.\n\nPolitical commentators and opposition parties have lambasted the response by Pinera\u2019s government to the protests, which started on Oct. 7 and have grown in intensity amid widespread discontent over the high cost of basic goods and utilities.\n\nSome said he provoked an explosive confrontation by rolling out riot police frequently accused of heavy-handedness instead of seeking dialogue with the protesters.\n\nLucia Dammert, an expert in public security at the University of Santiago, wrote on Twitter that when there were tanks on the streets \u201cwe have all lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state of emergency is a measure of last resort, the government had many other tools available to it to calm things down,\u201d she said.", "description": "Troops were patrolling the streets of the Chilean capital Santiago on Saturday morning, the military confirmed, after President Sebastian Pinera evoked a state of emergency amid a surge in violent protests over a hike in public transport fares.", "authors": ["Aislinn Laing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442692973&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0DD", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
