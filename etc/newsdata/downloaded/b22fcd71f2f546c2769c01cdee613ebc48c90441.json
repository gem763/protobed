Kjellberg, who has been subject to controversy in the past for making anti-Semitic jokes, put the conspiracies to rest in a tweet yesterday. Today, however, he reversed his decision, releasing a YouTube video in which he rescinded his pledge to donate to the ADL.\n\nKjellberg\u2019s video earlier this week had begun by describing his sponsorship with Honey. Then, he announced his planned donation to the ADL. In 2017, the ADL\u2019s CEO had commended Disney for dropping their partnership with Kjellberg after his \u201cpostings of videos on YouTube containing swastikas and other anti-Semitic content\u201d and \u201cwide dissemination of hate speech.\u201d Kjellberg, in his words, had \u201cfinally come to terms with the responsibility I have as a creator,\u201d and to many, his donation to the ADL seemed like a way for him to finally put to rest the past allegations of anti-Semitism.\n\nIn today\u2019s video, Kjellberg explained his decision not to donate after all. \u201cWhen we were planning the collaboration, we thought it would be nice to donate to a charity as a way to celebrate. I made the mistake of picking a charity I was advised instead of picking a charity I\u2019m personally passionate about, which is 100 per cent my fault,\u201d said Kjellberg in the video.\n\n\u201cWhen I uploaded the video talking about the charity, it was very brief. People could tell something was up. The whole internet just didn\u2019t believe it. \u2018Why is he donating to this charity? Look at his face.\u2019 Full conspiracy mode. It was very interesting to watch that unfold,\u201d laughed Kjellberg.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cI saw it as an opportunity to put an end to these alt-right claims that have been thrown against me. It wasn\u2019t to try and clear my name or say grace. If it was, I would have done it years ago. But after the Christchurch tragedy, I felt a responsibility to do something about it, because it\u2019s no longer just about me. It affected other people in a way, and I\u2019m not ok with that. I\u2019ve struggled to figure out how to do that, but this was not the right way to go about it. I knew it wasn\u2019t perfect, but I also didn\u2019t know a lot of things that surfaced throughout this whole thing about the charity that doesn\u2019t fit at all. So I understand why people had concerns about it. These are things I would have known myself if I had just taken my time... It really doesn\u2019t feel genuine for me to proceed with the donation at this point, and I instead wanted to actually take my time and keep the intent that I had, but do it with the right charity and doing it properly. I just wanted to make that clear. I\u2019m sorry for all the confusion, and I\u2019m sorry for messing this up. That\u2019s what I do!\u201d\n\nReached for comment, the ADL provided the same comment to Kotaku that they provided yesterday: \u201cADL learned about the potential donation from Felix Kjellberg when everyone else did: when he made the announcement on his channel earlier this week. We have not received any communication from him beyond that.\u201d Kjellberg has not yet returned Kotaku\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOver the last couple of days, Kjellberg\u2019s fans and followers have spread the claim that the ADL was blackmailing him after threats of \u201ccensoring\u201d or, ironically, \u201cdefaming\u201d him.\n\nThe backlash against his donation to the ADL was fuelled by conspiracies that the well-respected, 100-year-old anti-hate organisation could somehow shut down Kjellberg\u2019s YouTube channel, which had just hit 100 million subscriptions. In a recent video, Kjellberg himself described the ADL as an \u201corganisation that fights bigotry and prejudice in all its forms.\u201d", "description": "After Felix \u201cPewdiepie\u201d Kjellberg pledged to make a plush donation of over $70,000 to the Anti-Defamation League, an advocacy group founded to combat anti-Semitism, hundreds of his fans went into full conspiracy theory mode, questioning whether he had been blackmailed into doing so.
