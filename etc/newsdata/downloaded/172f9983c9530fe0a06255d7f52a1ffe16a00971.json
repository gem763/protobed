Photo: Adam Scull/Shutterstock\n\nSeemingly every celebrity to have walked the earth in the \u201970s and \u201980s makes an appearance in Elton John\u2019s new memoir, Me: the famed, the disgraced, and everyone in between. And Michael Jackson, whose legacy has been reevaluated after new child-molestation allegations came out in the documentary Leaving Neverland, is not exempt from John\u2019s pen. In the book, John describes the mid-1990s lunch at which his mom met his future husband David Furnish for the first time \u2014 and Michael Jackson was also a guest. A psychiatrist who John had also invited asked if he could take \u201chis client Michael Jackson,\u201d who was in England at the time. \u201cI could hardly refuse,\u201d John writes.\n\nJohn first met Jackson in his teens: \u201cAfter a gig I played in Philadelphia, Elizabeth Taylor had turned up on the Starship [John\u2019s private jet] with him in tow,\u201d he remembers. \u201cHe was just the most adorable kid you could imagine.\u201d Yet over time, that changed. \u201cGod knows what was going on in his head, and God knows what prescription drugs he was being pumped full of, but every time I saw him in his later years I came away thinking the poor guy had totally lost his marbles,\u201d John continues. \u201cHe was genuinely mentally ill, a disturbing person to be around. It was incredibly sad, but he was someone you couldn\u2019t help: he was just gone, off in a world of his own, surrounded by people who only told him what he wanted to hear.\u201d\n\nWhen John called Furnish to say that Jackson would be coming to the lunch, he \u201cwas interrupted by an anguished yell of \u2018are you fucking KIDDING me?\u2019\u201d \u201cNo, I insisted, it wouldn\u2019t be as strange as he might expect,\u201d John writes. \u201cIn that respect at least, I was absolutely right. The meal wasn\u2019t as strange as I might have expected. It was stranger than I could have imagined.\u201d As John tells it:\n\nIt was a sunny day and we had to sit indoors with the curtains drawn because of Michael\u2019s vitiligo. The poor guy looked awful, really frail and ill. He was wearing make-up that looked like it had been applied by a maniac: it was all over the place. His nose was covered with a sticking plaster which kept what was left of it attached to his face. He sat there, not really saying anything, just giving off waves of discomfort the way some people give off an air of confidence. I somehow got the impression he hadn\u2019t eaten a meal around other people for a very long time. Certainly, he wouldn\u2019t eat anything we served up. He brought his own chef with him, but didn\u2019t eat anything he made, either. After a while, he finally got up from the table without a word and disappeared. We finally found him, two hours later, in a cottage in the grounds of Woodside [John\u2019s house] where my housekeeper lived: she was sitting there, watching Michael Jackson quietly playing video games with her eleven-year-old son. For whatever reason, he couldn\u2019t seem to cope with adult company at all.\n\nLater, John reflects on Jackson\u2019s behavior and career, writing, \u201cI honestly think that\u2019s one of the things that tipped Michael Jackson over the edge: he was convinced he could make an album bigger than Thriller, and was crushed every time it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Police first investigated child-molestation claims against Jackson in 1993, and a family filed a lawsuit around the same time; Jackson also allegedly entered rehab in 1993 for an addiction to painkillers, but died with high levels of the sleep medicine propofol in his body. John, who was playing a show upon the news of Jackson\u2019s death, dedicated \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Sun Go Down on Me\u201d to the late performer. He hasn\u2019t directly addressed the allegations against Jackson.", "description": "In his new memoir, \u201cMe,\u201d Elton John writes of how Michael Jackson ended up at the lunch where his mother first met his future husband, David Furnish.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-elton-john-michael-jackson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
