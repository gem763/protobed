While his body of work in the regular season is practically unmatched, he had a 4.33 ERA in the postseason - and that was before giving up two more runs Wednesday.\n\nThe left-hander entered in the seventh and struck out Adam Eaton on three pitches with two on to end the inning.\n\nKershaw, however, never got another out.\n\n\u201cI might not get over it,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nKershaw also took the loss as a starter in Game 2 of this series at home, when he gave up three runs and six hits in six innings. He has nine career postseason wins, but has lost 11 times in 32 career outings.\n\n\u201cEverything people say is true right now about the postseason,\u201d Kershaw said.\n\nIf Rendon\u2019s home run to pull the Nationals within a run was a jolt to the system, the long ball from Soto, deep into the seats in right-center, was the gut punch. Kershaw crouched on the mound before Soto\u2019s drive even cleared the wall, removing his cap and turning his head to watch the ball land in the crowd.\n\nLifted by manager Dave Roberts for right-hander Kenta Maeda, Kershaw walked to the dugout with his head down, void of expression. He sat on the bench alone, slumped and sagging for a while, looking at the ground.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a pro. He\u2019s probably the best pitcher of our generation, and for him to make himself available tonight, and got us out of a big spot right there,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t work out. There\u2019s always going to be second-guessing when things don\u2019t work out. I\u2019ll take my chances on Clayton. \u2026 It\u2019s a guy that I believe in, I trust, and it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s struggles that followed were merely a continuation of a disappointing regular season, when the right-hander posted a 4.56 ERA in 51 1/3 innings. What was especially cruel for the Dodgers about watching Kelly struggle was that he was a key component out of a Boston Red Sox bullpen that held down Los Angeles in last year\u2019s World Series.\n\nKelly finished the season working his way through a mysterious lower-body injury that was essentially described as soreness.\n\nThe Dodgers dominated all season while winning a franchise-best 106 games and their seventh straight NL West title, but Washington was able to strike where they were most vulnerable. Los Angeles\u2019 bullpen was a roller-coaster due to inconsistent seasons form Kelly and closer Kenley Jansen, even if it did finish with an NL-best 3.78 ERA.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Clayton Kershaw might very well go into the Hall of Fame one day on the strength of his amazing regular-season success - dragging behind him a painful October history he would rather forget.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Padilla"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/aptopix_nlds_nationals_dodgers_baseball_75871_c0-142-3407-2128_s1770x1032.jpg?cd1cfc6f153d819a1e8eb7ea2d89c0294dfd3b77", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
