He spent five years on a hospital bed in the lounge, being looked after by me plus an army of carers. We were married for 49 years and I loved him and will miss him for ever.\n\nAfter he died, one of his carers got in touch suggesting a drink. We talked until 1.30am, had a hug and he left. We met up again several times and we kissed \u2014 I swear the earth fell off its axis. Then we had sex. It was the first time in 15 years for me and it was amazing.\n\nThe problem is I am 69 and he is 43. He says he has always been attracted to older women. I confided in a friend, who deemed me to be deluded and vulnerable. I see her point but I am having more fun than ever. The past five years were hell and I feel I deserve some pleasure. What do you think?\n\nAn anonymous reader, 69, who has been sleeping with her late husband's 43-year-old carer, asked for advice after friends deemed her deluded and vulnerable (file image)\n\nSTEPH SAYS: You cared for your sick husband for 15 years \u2014 the last five with your home as his hospital. You tended to him with love, care and utter devotion.\n\nYou are the embodiment of selfless love. I respect you enormously for this.\n\nYou have done this all for the love you had for your husband. And you will have felt devastated when he died, as well as some degree of relief that his suffering was over.\n\nPlease also remember your suffering and pain throughout these years. You\u2019re entitled to try to heal your wounded heart. I feel very strongly that you must allow yourself the right to feel a degree of freedom from any emotional responsibilities. However you do that, you must.\n\nYou may have been feeling a sense of guilt over your new experiences with your husband\u2019s ex-carer but you really should not. And you must ignore the friend telling you that this is not acceptable behaviour from a grieving widow. She\u2019s doing it because she feels she is protecting you, but you\u2019re fully aware of what you\u2019re doing and why.\n\nSteph (pictured with Dom) told the reader to embrace and celebrate the experience of being in bed with her late husband's carer\n\nFor 15 years, you nursed a cancer patient, whom you loved with all your heart. The fact is, unless they\u2019ve experienced it themselves, nobody will ever understand what it is to care for a terribly ill loved one. Equally, they will never understand the bond that can be forged between carer and family.\n\nThat relationship is incredibly deep, private and personal. Carers see you at your most vulnerable and at your worst. You have feelings of gratitude for their infinite kindness and dedication. It is entirely natural to develop strong feelings for them. And vice-versa.\n\nYou say that, initially, the two of you talked until the early hours. And this for me is key. How wonderful to talk with someone who knows you so well \u2014 and also to talk about the man you both knew so well, too! It is a huge emotional release for you. Your husband is not a taboo topic of conversation. What a wonderful gift.\n\nWhy not have a wonderful time in bed?\n\nYou\u2019ve both been on an intense journey together. You have my support and admiration for having forged an emotional and physical relationship from that.\n\nBut remember, if this doesn\u2019t develop into a grand love affair, so be it. You are a lady with many experiences of life, and if this is just a fling to get you through your grief and pain, then that is what you must do. Your wonderful experience in bed is to be celebrated, not criticised.\n\nYou know you deserve to be happy. It\u2019s time to allow yourself to be so.\n\nDOM SAYS: First, I\u2019m very sorry for your loss. Having recently lost my father to cancer, I know that the past ten years were pretty hard work for his wife. It is an utterly hideous thing to go through. So believe me, I know you have had a difficult time for a very long time. You have my full support and admiration.\n\nI wonder if you have heard of a thing called \u2018anticipatory grief\u2019. It does what it says on the tin, in that it means you start to grieve for the loss of a loved one when you know they are going to die.\n\nDom (pictured) told the reader that not everyone will understand her situation, and warned her not to be too disappointed if things don't work out long term\n\nYou feel the loss before it actually happens. Your husband died seven weeks ago, which is no time at all, but I understand how you may well have grieved his death quite some time ago.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say you aren\u2019t in pain and turmoil now, just that it may not be as early in the grieving process for you as some people might expect.\n\nWhile your friend may think your new relationship is premature, I do not.\n\nIt seems perfectly reasonable to me that you have already done a great deal of grieving. And I am delighted you have found some solace and comfort. The fact this solace comes in the arms of a younger man matters not one jot.\n\nThere are 26 years between you \u2014 so what! It really is just a number, as I\u2019m sure you know, given your beloved husband was 11 years older than you.\n\nYou\u2019re only 69 \u2014 to hell with the age gap\n\nYou are only 69. With a bit of luck you have a full 25 years ahead of you. Now, should this new romance go the distance, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019d be much swinging from the chandeliers then but he\u2019d be staring down 70 too that point.\n\nThere is no doubt you are on the rebound, but you seem to be taking this wisely and sensibly, so I say make hay while the sun shines. To hell with the age gap, you have the opportunity now for a new relationship to blossom and you should take it.\n\nGrab this happiness with both hands and stop worrying about the future.\n\nYou must stop beating yourself up about it. You\u2019ve had a dreadful 15 years. You did your duty. You looked after your husband. And you loved him. I\u2019m sure he would want you to find love again.\n\nTwo words of caution. You are, of course, vulnerable right now, so if things don\u2019t work out long term, do try not to be too disappointed.\n\nLive in the here and now and enjoy this.\n\nAnd second, not everyone will understand, so you might find your life will be easier if you keep it relatively quiet for now.\n\nIf you have a question you\u2019d like Steph and Dom to tackle, write to: stephanddom@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "An anonymous reader, 69, asked Steph and Dom Parker for advice on sleeping with her late husband's carer, 43.
