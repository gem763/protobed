dogs is as cruel as cock-fighting", "language": "en", "text": "Dr Amit Patel says he has an \u2018amazing bond\u2019 with his labrador Kika(Picture: Dr Amit Patel)\n\nA blind disability campaigner was berated by a woman at the pub who told him using a guide dog is \u2018cruel.\n\nDr Amit Patel says there is a growing trend of people who use service animals getting flack from people who compare it to slavery.\n\nHe says like most guide dogs, his pet labrador and best friend Kika would make it very clear if she didn\u2019t want to work.\n\nAmit was catching up with pal Jonathan Attenborough over a few beers at around 1am on Sunday when the woman launched her rant.\n\nJust a few hours earlier, he was presenting at the Animal Star Awards, where he gave a speech about blind people being told off in public for using their dogs.\n\nHe was catching up with his pal Jonathan Attenborough when they were accosted (Picture: Dr Amit Patel)\n\nHe told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Honestly I\u2019ve had my dog for nearly four years now, it\u2019s something I would never have thought would happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This was very much in my face, I could feel the spit on my face, that\u2019s how close she was.\u2019\n\nHe says she was waiting to get served at the bar of the Portsmouth Marriott Hotel when she commented on how \u2018wonderful\u2019 his and Jonathan\u2019s dogs were.\n\nBut then suddenly, the self-proclaimed animal rights activist compared the use of service animals to the same cock-fighting and told him to \u2018burn in hell\u2019.\n\nAmit said: \u2018I will try and explain but the situation yesterday, early Sunday morning, there was no way I was going to reason with her.\n\n\u2018She put it in the same category as people who have dogs for fighting\u2019.\n\nAmit offered to explain his side of things but the woman walked away (Picture: Dr Amit Patel)\n\nHe and fellow disability campaigner Jonathan held onto their dog\u2019s leashes tightly in case the woman, who \u2018just kept going\u2019, tried to do anything.\n\nHe added: \u2018She had a go at us for our dogs lying on the floor of the bar and saying how cruel it is, saying \u201cwhen was the last time they ran free?\u201d\u2018\n\nAmit said he had taken Kika for a run around the beach in Portsmouth that morning and that she is always moving as he travels the country for work.\n\nThe father-of-two added: \u2018They\u2019re with us all the time, they\u2019re not left at home \u2013 they\u2019re outside, they get exercise.\n\nAmit says he asked the woman, who was with a small group of friends, if she wanted to hear their side of the story but she walked away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018If you\u2019ve got an opinion and you want to air it, air it, but you\u2019ve got to listen to the response.\u2019\n\nAmit says it would be obvious if service animals didn\u2019t want to do their work (Picture: Dr Amit Patel)\n\nIn November animal welfare campaigner Wendy Turner-Webster told Good Morning Britain she believes using guide dogs is \u2018unethical\u2019 as they cannot consent.\n\nAmit said: \u2018Believe me when I say, if our service animals didn\u2019t want to work they wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to walk you into lampposts, it\u2019s going to walk across the toad where you don\u2019t want to be.\u2019\n\nHe praised Kika as being \u2018absolutely fantastic\u2019 by taking away the pressures of his disability and helping him have a normal life.\n\nAmit added \u2018Walking around with a white cane \u2013 by the time I get to where I need to be, I\u2019m physically and mentally exhausted.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t bumped into a lamppost since I\u2019ve had Kika.\u2019\n\nHe says the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association has a rigorous process to match guide dogs with their owners based on both of their needs and abilities.\n\nAs well as his guide dog, Amit says Kika is his \u2018best friend\u2019 who he trusts \u2018100 per cent\u2019 (Picture: Dr Amit Patel)\n\nThe inclusion consultant from Greenwhich, south east London, says five-year-old Kika \u2018thrives\u2019 on travelling and meeting lots of people, and of course other dogs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018If you don\u2019t really go out, a guide dog isn\u2019t really for you.\u2019\n\nFar from just considering his own needs, Amit says he thinks about his beloved pet \u2018all the time\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018I would change my plans to get to work if there was a train strike because I know replacement buses would freak her out.\u2019\n\nSometimes they will avoid certain stations at rush hour if Amit thinks his dog will be overwhelmed by the number of people.\n\nFar from being just a means to an end, he says Kika is a fully fledged member of a loving family.\n\nHe added: \u2018She\u2019s also my best friend, she\u2019s with me throughout the day, I trust her 100 per cent, she trusts me 100 per cent, that\u2019s the only way it will ever work, the bond is amazing.\u2019\n\nCouncil sex website teaches children about bukkake and being caught masturbating\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
