Austin police provided no information except to say the death isn\u2019t considered suspicious.\n\nSnead was one of the top recruits in the country when he signed with Texas in 2006, but he couldn\u2019t win the starting job over Colt McCoy. After limited playing time that season, Snead transferred to Ole Miss. He sat out the 2007 season and started for the Rebels in 2008 and 2009.\n\nSnead passed for 5,394 yards and 46 touchdowns in two seasons for the Rebels. Both marks rank in the top 10 in school history.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jevan Snead, the former Mississippi quarterback who ranks among the school's career passing leaders, has died in Texas at 32.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/obit_snead_football_90548_c0-88-2100-1312_s1770x1032.jpg?30dd1078ff68c7666153ff7c17bf3b0bdf3ea7ae", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
