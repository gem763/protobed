REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nBollore also told Les Echos newspaper on Thursday he was appealing to the key Renault shareholder, the French state, to avoid destabilizing the company.\n\n\u201cThe brutality and the totally unexpected character of what is happening are stupefying ... This coup de force is very worrying,\u201d Bollore said.\n\nEarlier, Bollore had skirted the matter of his potential exit from the firm in a conversation with staff on Thursday, two company sources said.\n\nA source close to the French government - a major Renault shareholder - earlier this week confirmed that a senior management shake-up at Renault was on the cards.\n\nLe Figaro newspaper reported that Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard was poised to kick off a process to replace Bollore.\n\nThe French finance ministry expressed its support of Senard on Thursday evening - after Bollore\u2019s comments were published - and said in a brief statement Senard was trusted to submit the \u201cnecessary decisions\u201d to Renault\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe French state holds a 15% stake in Renault.\n\nRenault Chief Financial Officer Clotilde Delbos could be named as interim CEO to replace Thierry Bollore, French TV BFM said on its website on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to staff on Thursday in an internal video exchange, Bollore referred to the media buzz and said that what mattered for the company was its alliance with Japan\u2019s Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T), and that it was \u201cnot a question of people,\u201d the Renault sources said.\n\nHe avoided going into further details, however, saying only that he had met with Senard earlier on Thursday, and referred all matters to the board.\n\nRenault declined to comment. Separately, the company said in a statement it would hold a board meeting on corporate governance issues on Friday.\n\nThe company, like its alliance partner Nissan, is still reeling from the arrest in Tokyo last year of former boss Carlos Ghosn on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies.\n\nBollore, for a long time Ghosn\u2019s right-hand man, was promoted to help steady Renault earlier this year, while Senard was hired from Michelin to chair the group.\n\n\u201cThe only thing one can reproach me, maybe, is to have been named deputy CEO in early 2018, on a proposal of Carlos Ghosn unanimously approved by the board,\u201d Bollore told Les Echos.\n\nAs well as stabilizing the alliance with Nissan, Senard was tasked with shaking up Renault\u2019s governance, which he had yet to do.\n\nAny change at the top of Renault would follow on the heels of a management overhaul at Nissan, and could help ease tensions between the alliance partners.\n\nA source close to the French government\u2019s thinking denied that Bollore\u2019s exit was part of a quid pro quo deal to appease Nissan and renew management at the top of the two companies.", "description": "Renault SA's CEO, Thierry Bollore, denounced as a \"coup\" his potential exit from the French carmaker, which has called a board meeting on Friday to discuss governance matters.", "authors": ["Gilles Guillaume", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439415134&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9919P", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
