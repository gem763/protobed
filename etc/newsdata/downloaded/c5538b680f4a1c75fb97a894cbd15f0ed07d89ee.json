But Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, tells us that this week\u2019s first anniversary is nothing to celebrate.\n\nRather than champagne corks being popped, the only sound is the screech of dragging heels by watchdogs and providers.\n\nGuy tells me: \u2018By this point we expected regulators to have already set out how they would abolish the loyalty penalty, and how they would better protect vulnerable and older people. Sadly, across the five important markets we focused on \u2013 mobile, broadband, home insurance, mortgages and savings \u2013 there just hasn\u2019t been enough progress.\u2019\n\nChange takes time but 12 months is excessive by any stretch. Guy pats the back of one market alone \u2013 mobiles.\n\nAs part of Ofcom\u2019s proposed remedies, it has come to voluntary arrangements with all providers \u2013 except for Three \u2013 to implement measures by February that will reduce many loyal customers\u2019 bills. Ofcom is now also requiring providers to alert mobile and broadband customers when contracts end.\n\nShe welcomes in the savings market the FCA\u2019s proposal of a basic savings interest rate. Guy says: \u2018This needs to be confirmed and implemented by the end of the year.\u2019\n\nThere has been a deathly silence from the mortgage market, where the average standard variable rate that loyal customers often end up paying far exceeds the cut-price deals for new customers.\n\nSimilarly, silence engulfs the insurance market. We, like Citizens Advice, demand the regulator crack down on \u2018price-walking\u2019 \u2013 the crafty tactic of gradually increasing prices year on year.\n\nThe charity wants this tackled by the end of next year. If nothing transpires it plans to demand the CMA launch a \u2018market study\u2019.\n\nCompanies that blithely apply the loyalty penalty could be forced to provide data on the watchdog\u2019s request \u2013 and come up with urgent remedies. Only then might we witness a meaningful change ... perhaps in time for next autumn.", "description": "They are still ripping off customers to the tune of millions of pounds a day despite regulators vowing to stamp out the scourge.", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton", "Financial Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
