Wang\u2019s firm had completed most of the legal work in the case, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Friday, neither Allred nor Wang would comment on the departure, save for a statement provided to the press.\n\n\u201cOur withdrawal has nothing to do with the merits of her case against President Trump,\u201d Allred said. \u201cWe will have no comment regarding the reasons for our firm\u2019s withdrawal. We continue to wish Summer the very best in her pursuit of justice.\u201d\n\nWang thanked Allred, an outspoken critic of Trump, and her firm \u201cfor all their work on this important case.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy firm will continue to represent Ms. Zervos,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWe look forward to proving her claim.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Zervos has issued a statement of her own.\n\n\u201cI decided to part ways with Gloria Allred purely for personal reasons, having nothing to do with her work as my attorney,\u201d Zervos said. \u201cI look forward to having my day in court with my current legal team.\u201d\n\nShe concluded with, \u201cI will have no further comment on this matter.\u201d\n\nDuring a hearing in December, Wang said the president \u201cwas not above the law.\u201d She offered to depose Trump at Mar-a-Lago \u201cin between rounds of golf.\u201d\n\nOne month later, Allred told The Daily Beast that Zervos\u2019 defamation case against the commander-in-chief is \u201cgoing to be a battle.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Trump\u2019s First Amendment defense, Allred said \u201cthe reason we filed this lawsuit is because we believe the truth matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe truth matters, and we believe that if a person believes\u2014or has reason to believe\u2014that they were defamed, they should have a right to pursue the person that defamed them,\u201d Allred added.\n\nZervos spoke out against Trump in October 2016, as a dozen other women accused the reality TV star of sexual misconduct weeks before the election. She accused her former Apprentice boss of repeatedly kissing and groping her without her consent in 2007, and of pressing his genitals up against her.\n\nHours after Zervos came forward, Trump told supporters at a North Carolina rally that the allegations are \u201c100% false\u201d and that \u201cthey are made up, they never happened.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears for personal fame, who knows maybe for financial reasons, political purposes.\u201d\n\nZervos filed her defamation suit in January 2017. She says Trump\u2019s statements\u2014that she created a \u201cphony\u201d story for fame\u2014caused her emotional and financial distress, and her restaurant to lose customers.\n\nThe statements \u201chave been deeply detrimental to Ms. Zervos\u2019s reputation, honor and dignity,\u201d the lawsuit states, adding that Zervos \u201cseeks all available remedies to undo this harm, including a retraction and apology by Mr. Trump.\u201d", "description": "Fresh off a victory in the lawsuit against President Trump, the famed attorney and her \u2018Apprentice\u2019 client are no longer working together.
