REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nThe key 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield spiked on Tuesday after a poorly-received auction, a sign markets were finally paying heed to BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda\u2019s recent comments warning against excessive falls in super-long yields.\n\nIn the last month the BOJ has repeatedly signaled its displeasure over what it saw as excessive declines in super-long yields and a flattening yield curve.\n\nIt has also reduced its bond purchasing plans for most maturities and signaled it could forgo operations to buy bonds with a maturity of over 25 years.\n\nSuch efforts have given rise to market views the BOJ is serious about steepening the yield curve, even if such attempts risk being interpreted as a withdrawal of monetary stimulus.\n\n\u201cMarket players realized the BOJ had a strong desire to prevent the yield curve from flattening,\u201d said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ is using verbal signals skillfully and controlling the yield curve fairly well these days,\u201d she said.\n\nJapanese finance and central bank officials took Tuesday\u2019s price action in stride, describing it as a one-off move rather than the start of a full-fledged uptrend in yields.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true the moves were a bit volatile,\u201d one of the officials said on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt would be problematic if yields test the upper limit of the BOJ\u2019s target range. Judging from recent moves, that\u2019s unlikely to happen.\u201d\n\nThe 10-year bond yield JP10YTN=JBTC briefly jumped 6.5 basis points to -0.160% on Tuesday, before pulling back to -0.165% on Wednesday.\n\nBALANCING TOUGH, BUT DOABLE\n\nUnder its yield curve control (YCC) policy, the BOJ pledges to guide short-term rates at -0.1% and the 10-year yield around 0%.\n\nThe policy is aimed not only at keeping borrowing costs ultra-low, but at preventing excessive falls in long-term yields that would strain financial institutions\u2019 margin.\n\nGlobal economic uncertainties, however, have repeatedly pushed the 10-year yield below the -0.2% level, seen by markets as the BOJ\u2019s line in the sand. That has dragged on super-long yields.\n\nBOJ officials concede that putting a floor under rates is tougher than capping them as it requires trimming bond buying, a move that could be seen as a withdrawal of stimulus and trigger an unwelcome rise in the yen.\n\nStill, the BOJ will likely rely on verbal jawboning and market operations to rein in sharp yield falls for now, rather than take bolder steps such as an overhaul of its policy framework, say sources familiar with its thinking.\n\nSpecifically, the central bank - which already owns 40% of the JGB market - will continue to slow bond buying, carefully timing the moves when markets are fairly stable, they said.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ will act against excessive falls in super-long yields. It will also try to allow market forces to drive yield moves to some extent,\u201d one of the source said. \u201cStriking the right balance is tough, but doable.\u201d\n\nSome market players, however, doubt whether the BOJ can keep controlling yields with such modest steps, when heightening global uncertainties leave markets vulnerable to sharp swings.\n\nThe BOJ may also struggle to keep alive market expectations of near-term easing, without crushing long-term yields.\n\nFaced with escalating global risks, the BOJ has signaled its readiness to ease as early as its Oct. 30-31 rate review. Kuroda has said any easing would aim at lowering short- to medium term rates, without flattening the yield curve. He did not elaborate on how the BOJ would do this.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of investors waiting to buy JGBs the moment yields rise,\u201d said Shuji Tonouchi, senior market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether bond markets will move in a way the BOJ wants.\u201d", "description": "The Bank of Japan will stick to its playbook of minor tweaks and verbal warnings to rein in sharp falls in long-term interest rates, sources say, raising questions about its ability to control the yield curve while managing market expectations.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436544861&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910HO"}
