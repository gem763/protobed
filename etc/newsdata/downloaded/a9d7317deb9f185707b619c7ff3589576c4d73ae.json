At the executive level, women hold just 23% of c-suite positions; for women of color, that figure drops to 4%, a McKinsey & Company study found last year.\n\nCompanies that don\u2019t address diversity put themselves at risk of financial peril, Ariel Investments Co-CEO Mellody Hobson said in a newly released interview, taped last month.\n\n\u201cI don't equivocate on this: Firms that are not paying attention to this are committing corporate suicide. It may not be fast, but at some point, it will come if you don't pay attention to this,\u201d Hobson says in response to a question about diversity from Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer.\n\nIn the course of their work at an investment firm, Hobson and her colleagues speak to leaders from other companies, who she said offer \u201ca lot of excuses when it comes to why boards are not diverse or management teams are not diverse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not believe you can be a 21st-century company in this world without having a perspective, and being inclusive, and having a diverse make-up in your employment base,\u201d says Hobson, who sits on the board of directors at Starbucks and JPMorgan Chase.\n\n\u201cWe think it's extraordinarily important,\u201d she adds.\n\nHobson is the co-CEO of Ariel Investments, a firm with assets totaling $12.9 billion, where she worked for nearly the past three decades. Her Ted Talk on challenging racial inequality, given in 2014, has been viewed more than 3.7 million times.\n\nShe made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nMellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments and a member of Starbucks Coffee Company's Board of Directors, speaks Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle.

Warren) More\n\nHobson said she speaks out about diversity in her role as a board member at Starbucks (SBUX) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).\n\n\u201cI have a point of view around diversity and inclusion, to the extent that companies are really prepared to talk about the issues and address them,\u201d she says.\n\nIn the case of Starbucks and JPMorgan, they are very, very, very serious about this. And so it's great to be a part of that conversation, and move the needle forward in terms of inclusion, and making sure that we have people of color represented in all areas of the business \u2014 with our vendors, in our philanthropy, all of those things.\u201d\n\nAndy Serwer is editor-in-chief of Yahoo Finance.
