The drills are designed to test the combat-readiness of the military command and troops within the central military district in Russia (hence being called \"Tsentr-2019\") and will also see the country test its military capabilities in the Arctic.\n\nThe season of Tsentr exercises actually started in June but this week is seen as the culmination of those in the most important \"strategic command post exercise,\" known as the \"hot phase\" by experts.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu insisted earlier in September that the strategic military exercises are not directed against other countries but are instead focused on countering the threat from international terrorism.\n\nBut experts say the exercises are also designed to show Russia's military strength and abilities, showcase its weaponry for commercial purposes and, most importantly, are meant to send an unequivocal message to the West.\n\n\"This is very much an anti-American message, an anti-Western message that Russia is not isolated and Russia can operate with a potential rival \u2014 because China is very much seen both as a friend and an enemy and potential competitor to Russian interests in the future,\" Mathieu Boulegue, research fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, said in a briefing ahead of the exercises.\n\n\"The message is quite clear when it comes to Russia, it means that 'we're not alone, we have a lot of partners, we're not isolated so whatever efforts the West are trying to do against us we are still able to have powerful military alliances with China, India and Pakistan',\" he said.", "description": "Russia is carrying out a series of large-scale military exercises with China, India and Pakistan in what experts believe is Moscow trying to send a powerful message to the West.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106133502-1568715273886gettyimages-1032498284.jpeg?v=1568715339", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
