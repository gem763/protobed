Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nFormer world number one Murray, 32, is regaining his fitness after a hip resurfacing procedure at the start of the year and recorded the first two wins of his singles comeback at the Rafa Nadal Open Challenger tournament in Mallorca last month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still kind of going through the recovery process from the operation. My muscles are still recovering, the ones that were cut during the procedure... sometimes I feel a little bit slow on the court,\u201d Murray told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that with playing more at this level, more time to recover, I\u2019ll start to get a little bit faster.\n\n\u201cThe conditions here are difficult, very humid, which is always tough... I have no pain in my hip any more, so that\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d\n\nMurray, who has dropped to 413 in the world rankings, will also compete in Beijing and Shanghai in the Asian swing of the ATP tour but the three-times major winner said his performance in Mallorca showed he still needed time to return to his best.\n\n\u201cI think physically I still have a lot of improving to do if I want to get back to competing on the tour at the highest level because it showed there that I wasn\u2019t quite ready to play many matches in a row,\u201d Murray, who lost in the third round, said.\n\n\u201cThe last three weeks since that tournament, I\u2019ve spent time working on my physical conditioning.\u201d\n\nUnseeded Murray will begin his Zhuhai campaign against American Tennys Sandgren, his conqueror in the Winston-Salem Open first round last month.\n\nHe also confirmed he would play in next year\u2019s inaugural ATP Cup \u2014 a nation-based event ahead of the Australian Open.", "description": "Andy Murray is looking to improve his speed around the court as he steps up his return to singles action at the Zhuhai Championships in China following career-saving hip surgery.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432643346&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0H3", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
