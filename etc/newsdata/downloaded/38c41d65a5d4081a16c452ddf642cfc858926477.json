The S&P 500 edged down 7.25 points, or 0.2%, to 2977.62. The indexes narrowed their losses and briefly turned higher in the final hour of the session, but then slid into the closing bell.\n\nThe technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 46.72 points, or 0.6%, to 8030.66.\n\n\"We're just living and reacting to every headline,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, who was sitting in London but watching the hearing, and also following the political turmoil in his own country. \"It's a circus,\" he said, \"a 21st century version of a circus.\"\n\nThe modest moves through the session reflect the market's recent ambivalence, as traders are caught between monitoring earnings and economic fundamentals on one hand and parsing political headlines on the other. Indeed, the Dow is down 1.7% from its July record high, and up 1.9% from a year ago.\n\nThe controversy over Ukraine has become a political danger to Mr. Trump's presidency, and while the odds of him being removed from office appear remote, the magnitude of the fight has forced market players to pay attention. The U.K. political battle over Brexit likewise has traders fixated.\n\nNone of it, however, has derailed the main trends in the equities market.\n\nRight now, the momentum is still with value stocks like utility companies, real estate, and consumer staples, said Frank Cappelleri, executive director of Instinet. \"You have to respect that until it changes,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, those sectors were among the leaders Thursday. Consumer staples and utilities are both on track for gains of more than 1% this week.\n\nConagra Brands gained $1.10, or 3.7%, to $31 after the company topped profit estimates for the latest quarter and reaffirmed its outlook, offsetting a sales miss.\n\nAmong utilities, Edison International, NiSource, and CMS Energy all gained more than 1%.\n\nOn the downside, the consumer discretionary, health-care, and communication services sectors in the S&P 500 all lost more than 0.5%.\n\nCarnival was among the biggest declines. Shares fell $4.11, or 8.6%, to $43.95 after the cruise-ship company cut its outlook for the year, citing disruptions from Hurricane Dorian and tensions in the Arab Gulf. Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings both dropped more than 2%.\n\nTech stocks, long the momentum-crowd darlings, fell. Facebook, Apple and Alphabet edged lower.\n\nPeloton Interactive shares started trading on the public markets with a thud. The stock fell $3.24, or 11%, to $25.76 after the company's shares priced Wednesday night at $29, the top of the projected range.\n\nThe weak debut is another dent in the IPO market, after the high-profile postponement of WeWork parent company's offering.\n\nInvestors and traders also continued to monitor the state of trade talks between the U.S. and China.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Chinese companies had agreed to buy \"sizable amounts\" of soybeans and pork from the U.S. ahead of high-level talks scheduled for next month. President Trump also voiced optimism about a deal.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S. -- was unrevised in the second quarter, although a key measure of corporate profits was revised lower. U.S. jobless claims increased slightly last week, according to the Labor Department.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys slipped to 1.685% from 1.732% Wednesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. In commodity markets, U.S. crude fell 0.1%. Gold prices added 0.1%.\n\nMax Bernhard contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Paul Vigna at paul.vigna@wsj.com and Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 17:24 ET (21:24 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
