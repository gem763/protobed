Oregon announced this week that the death of a patient in July was also being linked to vaping. Indiana's announcement did not mention when the death occurred.\n\nPatients have reported symptoms including breathing difficulty and chest pain before they were hospitalised and placed on ventilators.\n\nMedics said many people had been initially misdiagnosed as having bronchitis or a viral illness until their symptoms escalated, at times to very extreme levels.\n\nThe parents of Kevin Boclair, a 19-year-old from Philadelphia, told local news CBS 3 Philly their son had been placed in a medically-induced coma three weeks ago and may require a lung transplant if he ever recovered.\n\n\"I even know, as a nurse, he could die,\" said his mother Deborah Boclair. \"So we are hoping it gets better, and I just want his friends to know and all these kids out there - I could tell the parents, 'tell your kids don't do this.'\"\n\nSean Callahan, the doctor who successfully treated 20-year-old Alexander Mitchell from Provo in Utah, told AFP: \"I've never seen anything like this before.\n\n\"You know, when I've had people this sick who need this sort of life support, it's a really advanced case of like a flu, pneumonia, or patients who have weakened immune systems from cancer and chemotherapy.\"\n\nMany of those who have recovered received steroid treatments, though doctors are not sure whether it was the drugs that cured them.\n\nInvestigators are also uncertain about whether the cases have only been occurring recently, or were happening earlier but were not being linked to vaping because of a lack of awareness.\n\nE-cigarettes have been available in the US since 2006, and are sometimes used as an aid to quit smoking traditional tobacco products like cigarettes.\n\nTheir use among adolescents has skyrocketed in recent years: some 3.6 million middle and high school students used vaping products in 2018, an increase of 1.5 million on the year before.\n\nFor now, the outbreak appears to be confined to the United States, despite vaping's growing global popularity.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Life & Culture - [WASHINGTON] A third person has died in the United States as a result of severe pulmonary disease linked to vaping, officials said Friday, in an outbreak that has sickened hundreds and left several teens in induced comas. .
