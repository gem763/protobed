But now it's Boris Johnson's turn for the big one - the leader's speech.\n\nWill the prime minister drop some policy announcements ahead of the general election that could take place this autumn? Or will the tone be one of less specific optimism? There's likely to be more focus than usual on his language, following recent disputes about his comments in Parliament.\n\nAnother big question hangs over the speech, specifically when it will take place. It's scheduled to be the closing event on Wednesday - the final day. But, with the Supreme Court decision overruling the prorogation - suspension - of Parliament, Parliament will be sitting throughout the conference.\n\nWednesday is also when prime minister's questions takes place. It's been reported that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will fill in for the PM in the Commons.\n\nWhatever happens, Mr Johnson will hope things go more smoothly than Theresa May's mishap-ridden speech of 2017.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May was handed a P45 by a comedian during her conference speech\n\n2) What about 'the 21'?\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Will Rory Stewart turn up?\n\nWith disagreements about Brexit overwhelming politics, 21 MPs were recently expelled from the Conservative Party.\n\nBut they still sit on the same Commons benches as their erstwhile colleagues and, mostly, would still call themselves Tories.\n\nSo will the likes of Philip Hammond, Ken Clarke, Justine Greening and Rory Stewart (a contender in the summer's leadership race, lest we forget) turn up in Manchester? And, if they do, what kind of reception will they get?\n\n3) Protests\n\nWhile events inside the hall at Conservative conferences are often managed, polite affairs, the opposite can be true outside the building.\n\nIn recent years protesters have gathered in large numbers to address attendees in often ripe language.\n\n4) Brexit...but what about other policies?\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Priti Patel is expected to talk tough on crime\n\nBrexit is impossible to get away from, really. But there will be focus on other issues.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel will attempt to galvanise the government's tough-on-crime message when she addresses the conference on Tuesday.\n\nMonday, meanwhile, will be more business-focused, with Chancellor Sajid Javid speaking and a discussion on the economy and the environment.\n\nAnimal welfare policies, environmental plans including a proposed \u00a31bn fund to boost the electric motor industry and a pledge to plant one million new trees are on the agenda. Look out for more non-Brexit policies day by day as conference continues.\n\n5) Joggers - and posing\n\nPoliticians these days are far fitter than they used to be - or at least they like to show they are. Security permitting, will Mr Johnson go for a run around Manchester?\n\nWill Michael Gove don his shorts and T-shirt and do the same?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A little bit of this?\n\nEven if they're not in lycra, ministers - at least those not forced stay in London for Commons business - will be out and about doing photo opportunities.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption And a little bit of that?\n\nSchools, factories, farms and retirement homes: watch out.", "description": "The Conservative party is assembling for its annual conference, but what issues and events are likely to shape the week?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/173FE/production/_109003259_d4d635cc-b605-46a4-85cb-901d6fbdd943.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
