The OECD published the proposals in a consultation document on Wednesday.\n\nThe rise of big internet companies like Google and Facebook has pushed current tax rules to the limit as such firms can legally book profit and park assets like trademarks and patents in low-tax countries like Ireland regardless of where their customers are.\n\nEarlier this year more than 130 countries and territories agreed that a rewriting of tax rules largely going back to the 1920s was overdue and tasked the Paris-based OECD public policy forum to come up with proposals.\n\nThe issue of taxing big cross-border multinational firms has become all the more urgent as a growing number of countries have adopted plans for their own tax on digital companies in the absence of a global deal.\n\nRead more: 'On some level, no one deserves to have that much money,' billionaire Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in response to Bernie Sanders saying billionaires shouldn't exist\n\n\"The current system is under stress and will not survive if we don't remove the tensions,\" OECD head of tax policy Pascal Saint-Amans told journalists on a conference call.\n\nSome OECD countries have been pushing for the tech giants to pay tax in all countries where they have users.\n\nFrance in particular has been vocal on the subject, proposing a digital services tax which would levy a 3% tax on French sales for a select group of 30 companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. US President Trump was incensed by the proposal, ordering a probe into whether it unfairly targeted US companies.\n\nThe UK proposed a similar 2% tax in October 2018, slated to come into force in 2020, and now-Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed support for the idea at the time. \"It's deeply unfair that high-street businesses are paying tax through the nose ... whereas the internet giants, the FAANGs \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google \u2014 are paying virtually nothing,\" said Johnson.", "description": "Countries such as France have been pushing for stricter rules which would force the tech giants to pay more tax.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7233c22e22af0f302aa363?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
