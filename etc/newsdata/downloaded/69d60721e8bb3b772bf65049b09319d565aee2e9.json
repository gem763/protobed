Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., threatened to offer an amendment reversing the Trump administration\u2019s Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy.\n\nIn order to avoid a vote on this amendment, which could have passed the committee, Republicans on the panel agreed to add new language proposed by Shaheen to the bill.\n\nThat language, released just minutes before the scheduled committee markup, represents an attempt to work around the administration\u2019s prohibition on international abortion funding by providing $665 million for \u201cfamily planning and reproductive health care\u201d\u2014which would go to groups that promote abortion.\n\nThe new amendment, ultimately adopted as part of the final bill, also enshrines problematic language on sexual orientation and gender identity and hinders the administration\u2019s efforts to expand USAID funding to pro-life and faith-based groups.\n\nOne provision requires the agency to inform Congress if any group that receives funding has been found to violate an Obama-era regulation interpreting sex discrimination as including sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe Supreme Court is considering whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\u2019s prohibition on sex discrimination includes sexual orientation and gender identity. This new language, if passed into law, could undermine the Justice Department\u2019s argument in Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC that Congress has not previously affirmed that reading of the law.\n\nThe Shaheen amendment also requires creation of a \u201cshame list\u201d by requiring reporting to Congress that would expose pro-life and faith-based recipients of USAID funding to complaints that they refuse to comply with Obama administration regulations requiring them to make referrals for abortion and endorse radical sexual orientation and gender identity ideology.\n\nThe Shaheen amendment is only one aspect of this troubling compromise by Senate appropriators, however.\n\nThe committee report attached to the bill, which contains instructions on how funds are to be used, recommends an increase in funding for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex portfolio in USAID\u2019s Human Rights Division.\n\nCountries found to engage in \u201cofficial government discrimination\u201d against LGBT individuals could lose access to USAID funding. It\u2019s unclear whether that includes countries that define marriage as between one man and one woman or whose laws define sex as binary and biological.\n\nFinally, the report requires creation of a pilot program to align women\u2019s economic empowerment programs with global health programs that include family planning and reproductive health.\n\nThat appears to be an attempt to tie funding for programs such as the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, which focuses on enabling women around the world to support themselves and their families, to promotion of and funding for abortion.\n\nThe Senate should uphold its end of the bargain made with the White House last summer. That stipulates no funding for abortion-promoting groups, no radical redefinition of marriage and gender, and no shady attempts to implement such policies through a process that\u2019s meant to exclude them.", "description": "The Trump administration has made good on its promise to implement pro-life policies throughout the federal government, including in America\u2019s foreign policy and in humanitarian aid.\u00a0\n\nBut those advances could be dealt a crippling blow as a result of a compromise by Senate Republicans, who are cooperating with an underhanded attempt to stymie the administration\u2019s efforts through controversial additions to must-pass appropriations bills.", "authors": ["Andrea Jones", "Research Assistant", "Devos Center", "Andrea Is A Research Assistant In The Devos Center For Religion", "Civil Society At The Heritage Foundation."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-960290950.jpg?itok=H12Gbi_e", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
