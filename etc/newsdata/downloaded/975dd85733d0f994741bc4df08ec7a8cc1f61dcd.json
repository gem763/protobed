Wait For The Fed First", "language": "en", "text": "Is the gold rally under threat?\n\nThe world\u2019s favorite safe haven has gone far this year\u2014hitting highs not seen since 2013\u2014as collapsing bond yields, currency and equity market flux, sliding global rates, Brexit scare and recession fears over the U.S.-China trade war forced global investors to look for the best hedge.\n\nAnd many found it in gold.\n\nGold Daily Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nThe yellow metal has had a meteoric rise over the past four months, rising from a low of around $1,285 per ounce in May to six-year highs above $1,566 in Wednesday\u2019s futures trade on New York\u2019s Comex.\n\nBut just as stunning as that rally was the near $35 (or more than 2%) drop on Thursday over news that Washington and Beijing were poised to restart trade talks in October. That marked the largest one-day loss for since January and the biggest percentage slide for bullion or spot gold in 2019.\n\nCurrent Rally May Be Reaching Exhaustion\n\nGold longs\u2019 struggle of late to make the kind of advances that seemed easy just a couple of months ago suggests that this year\u2019s rally may be reaching exhaustion.\n\nThursday\u2019s intraday slide to below the key support of $1,515 may have set the market up for what could eventually be a return to $1,400 levels, some say.\n\nWhile the die-hard gold bug and his favorite metal won\u2019t yet part, the average gold investor is probably awaiting the Sept. 17-18 to see what that brings for U.S. rates.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its last meeting in August and is expected to do the same at its forthcoming meeting, bringing rates to a range of between 1.75% and 2%.\n\nIf that happens, gold could regain steam for an upward trek. The expectation is for it to make a run for $1,600 before attempting the ultimate challenge: A new record high to rewrite the 2011 peak of above $1,900.But the opposite could also happen, with gold spiraling downward from here.\n\nNo Certainty Of Another Fed Cut\n\nDespite the Fed Rate Monitor Tool on Investing.com giving a for a 25-bp cut this September, Canadian advisory group TD Securities said it wasn\u2019t sure about the Fed delivering:\n\n\u201cWith the S&P 500 sitting only a few percentage points off its highs, financial conditions have not tightened materially, which could embolden the Fed to ultimately disappoint the market's rate cut expectations.\u201d\n\nMichael Boutros, a technical strategist for gold, sounded another note of caution in an update issued earlier this week. Since September began, Boutros said gold has marked a third divergence high in price, with its daily Relative Strength Indicator holding a multi-month support trigger.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cWeakness beyond the monthly open would risk a larger setback in gold prices, with such a scenario targeting channel support around the 8/13 low of near $1,479 \u2013 an area of interest for possible exhaustion/long-entries IF reached.\u201d \u201cInitial resistance remains at $1,558 with a break higher targeting longer-term objectives at the confluence of the upper parallel and the 61.8% retracement of the entire decline off the record 2011 highs at $1,586.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still plenty of scope for gold to extend its rally on the potential for more dismal global news or data. Futures are up about 18% on the year, while the spot price is about 16% higher. But to make a record high before the year end, it will need to gain nearly 30%, a probability looking more doubtful than ever now.\n\nComeback In Risk Assets Possible\n\nEven without its own fatigue, gold could succumb to other pressures, particularly the comeback in equities and other risk assets if U.S.-China developments remain encouraging.\n\nThe TD Securities\u2019 note alluded as much in its note, saying:\n\n\u201cShould the positive trade headlines cluster, we could well see the precious metals complex consolidate lower, particularly given that other event risks have somewhat simmered, ahead of the various central bank meetings in September.\u201d\n\nSo, is it time to bail out of gold?\n\nLet\u2019s wait for the Fed to show its hand first.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, Gold Futures.
