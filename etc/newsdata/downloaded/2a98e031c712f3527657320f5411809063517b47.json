But nobody questioned Mulvaney's Nationals fandom, even though he grew up in North Carolina and represented South Carolina in Congress \u2014 Atlanta Braves territory.\n\nFrom members of Congress to city leaders, Supreme Court justices to TV pundits, cheering for the Nationals is one thing Washington politicos can agree on. Nationals Park, 1\u00bd miles south of the Capitol, has long been considered a bipartisan oasis where Republicans and Democrats can set aside their differences while dissecting the manager's bullpen moves. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Democratic predecessor, Harry Reid, have said the Nationals were one subject they could discuss without things getting heated.\n\n\"I think it's the only safe haven in D.C. that's a politics-free zone,\" said Tom Davis, a Republican former congressman from northern Virginia and a season ticket holder. \"Everybody's sitting there rooting for the same team, unless you're from Houston.\"\n\nThat bipartisan comity could be tested on Sunday by President Donald Trump, who faces an impeachment inquiry to determine whether he violated his oath of office by asking Ukraine to investigate a political opponent.\n\nTrump has announced he plans to attend Game 5 of the World Series between Washington and Houston, should the series last that long. The Nationals lead the Astros 2-0 and could close out the Series on Saturday night, giving the capital city its first World Series title since 1924.\n\nIf Trump does attend, it would be his first visit to Nationals Park since he took office. He is the only president in more than 80 years not to visit the ballpark or toss a ceremonial first ball when Washington had a team.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt threw out the first pitch in Game 3 of the 1933 World Series at Griffith Stadium, the last World Series in Washington. Richard Nixon was an enthusiastic Washington Senators booster until the franchise left town for the second time after the 1971 season. And George W. Bush and Barack Obama revived the tradition after the Expos moved to Washington in 2005, becoming the Nationals.\n\nTrump, however, will not throw out the first pitch. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said the president will arrive after the game starts and leave before the final out, in hopes of making his visit less disruptive to fans.\n\nThe Nationals announced Friday that Washington-based celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a Trump critic who has repeatedly opposed Trump's immigration policies and his administration's response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, will perform the honors for Sunday's game.\n\nBy avoiding pregame pageantry, Trump will spare himself a likely hostile reception.\n\n\"I've seen them boo mayors and everybody else there,\" Davis said. \"For politicians, throwing out the first ball has gotten riskier. It's been risky, pre-Trump, and this is a city that gave him 4% of the vote, so it's probably not his strongest base city.\"\n\nThe Nationals don't often feature elected officials or famous-in-D.C. types on the in-stadium video screens, allowing polarizing figures like McConnell and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to enjoy the games in peace. Davis said he's never seen anyone harassed in the stands, and he said overt political displays wouldn't be welcome.\n\nRed hats with a curly \"W'' are everywhere; red hats that say \"Make America Great Again\" are hard to find.\n\nThere are other signs that the impeachment drama is taking lawmakers' minds off baseball.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was wounded in a 2017 mass shooting while practicing with fellow Republicans for their annual charity baseball game against Democrats, spoke to The Associated Press last year about how meaningful the ballpark is to him. It's been a place where he can bond with Democrats and the site of milestones in his recovery \u2014 he threw out the first pitch at a 2017 playoff game and returned to the field in the Congressional baseball game last year.\n\nBut Scalise's spokeswoman said by email Wednesday his schedule was too packed this week to talk baseball, and at the time she wrote, Scalise was among the roughly two dozen GOP congressmen who were crashing a closed-door impeachment deposition.\n\nPerhaps a visit to the ballpark could again provide some solace from a rough week at the office.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ben Nuckols at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
