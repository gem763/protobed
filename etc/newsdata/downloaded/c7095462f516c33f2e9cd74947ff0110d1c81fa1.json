Clayton\u2019s energy, talent, and international fanbase make this partnership a home run for Skechers for years to come.\u201d\n\nA left-handed starter, Kershaw has spent his major league career with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Drafted seventh overall in 2006, he quickly progressed through the Dodgers\u2019 farm system and reached the majors in 2008 at only 20 years old, making him the youngest active player in MLB for an entire year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. He has since won two more Cy Young Awards and was named National League Most Valuable Player in 2014. An eight-time All-Star, Kershaw has the lowest career earned run average and walks per innings pitched average among starters in the live-ball era with a minimum of 1,000 innings pitched. He led the MLB in ERA for four consecutive seasons from 2011 to 2014 and recently surpassed the legendary Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax for most wins and strikeouts by a left-handed starter in Dodgers history.\n\nOff the field, Kershaw and his wife, Ellen, seek to serve vulnerable and at-risk children in Los Angeles, Dallas, Zambia and the Dominican Republic through \"Kershaw's Challenge,\" the couple\u2019s charitable organization. Skechers shares their commitment to children and has agreed to sponsor the Kershaw\u2019s Challenge annual PingPong4Purpose charity event held at Dodger Stadium each summer. Kershaw has been honored with the Roberto Clemente Award and the Branch Rickey Award for his humanitarian work.\n\nSkechers has a long history working with athletes to represent its men\u2019s collections.
