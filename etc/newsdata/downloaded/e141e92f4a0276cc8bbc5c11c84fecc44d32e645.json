It said housewife underneath and it said she must be on benefits. That really knocked me for six.\n\nNadiya appeared on Jay Rayner\u2019s podcast\n\n\u2018Part of me was expecting those sorts of comments to come up and I was a housewife and I maintain to this day that it was the best job I have ever done. It the most rewarding, least paid but the most rewarding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018At the time that cut like a knife because for somebody who had worked really hard up until the point I got married, I stopped working just to raise my children because I couldn\u2019t afford to pay childcare so I had to stay at home with my kids. And I never felt the need to justify my decisions but suddenly you are put in a position where you have justify your decisions and choices and that was really hard to deal with because here I am Muslim woman, it\u2019s like how does it feel? I don\u2019t know, what am I doing, I haven\u2019t done anything.\n\n\u2018I was just a really anxious person dealing really badly with panic disorder who just wanted to do something for herself.\u2019\n\nThe chef added that she didn\u2019t tell her parents that she was on the show until week eight.\n\nNadiya told food critic Jay: \u2018I was finally doing something for me, and I\u2019ve been told all my life, you\u2019re a girl, you can\u2019t do this, you shouldn\u2019t be doing that. I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I know the instant reaction would be.\n\n\u2018What, you\u2019re leaving your children and your husband to go and fanny about on this cookery show. What\u2019s going on? I knew that\u2019s what I would get straight away so I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone. I didn\u2019t tell my parents until about week eight. Bearing in mind that my parents don\u2019t watch Bake Off, they didn\u2019t understand what it was I was doing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not only Nadiya who has received criticism since her time on Bake Off, as her husband Abdal has also received abuse due to Nadiya\u2019s status.\n\nShe explained: \u2018In all cultures men are seen as the breadwinners, they are the one that bring the bacon home I suppose, and the world doesn\u2019t work like that.\n\n\u2018It just isn\u2019t like that anymore. Women work, men work and it\u2019s a partnership and it\u2019s a combination.\u2019\n\nOut To Lunch with Jay Rayner season two is out now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
