He also visited her in prison on dozens of occasions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wrote: \u2018Rose\u2019s first paramour was the Moors murderer, Myra Hindley, who happened to be on the hospital wing at HMP Durham at the same time in 1995 and early 1996. Hindley was there because she had \u2018fallen over\u2019 in the exercise yard of F Wing. It was prison policy that a new inmate who was a lifer would first be assessed on the prison wing.\n\n\u2018I recall that Rose was quite taken with Hindley, impressed by her knowledge and ability. Rose said Hindley had studied various Open University courses.\n\n\u2018She said, \u2018Yeah, Myra, she\u2019s all right, we get on, I want to see how it goes\u2019. This was a reference to a flowering, albeit short-lived, lesbian relationship.\u2019\n\nRose\u2019s relationship with Myra soon soured after her opinon of Hindley changed (Picture: Rex Features) When Mr Goatley visited a few months later he learned how Rose\u2019s opinion of Hindley had changed dramatically, saying \u2018She is very manipulative. You don\u2019t realise it, but she gets you doing stuff for her. Oh, she\u2019s clever, all right. She\u2019s flippin\u2019 dangerous, that one. She ain\u2019t going to take me for a c*** again.\u2019 And so heralded the end of the romance.\u2019 Mr Goatley says the affair was one of many female relationships West enjoyed in prison, adding: \u2018The friendships were genuinely supportive and often sexual. They could also be unstable and end in resentment.\u2019 Hindley was convicted in 1966 for killing ten-year-old Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans, 17. She was also an accessory when her boyfriend Ian Brady murdered 12-year-old John Kilbride. She died 60 in 2002. West was jailed for life in 1995 for killing 10 women. Both women received life sentences. Got a story for Metro.co.uk? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
