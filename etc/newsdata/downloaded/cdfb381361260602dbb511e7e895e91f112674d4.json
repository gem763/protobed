REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido\n\nChile\u00b4s national prosecutor Jorge Abbott on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to ratify his recommendation that Emiliano Arias, a prosecutor in the provincial town of Rancagua, be sacked for \u201cbad behaviour and negligence\u201d.\n\nIn a statement sent to Reuters, the national prosecuting authority said an internal investigation found Arias had passed classified information about a drug trafficking case to his sister, failed to investigate leaks from his team to the media and failed to allocate resources to a fellow prosecutor.\n\n\u201cIn court further information will be given about historic behaviour to justify the request (for his removal),\u201d the statement added.\n\nArias told reporters in a press conference in Santiago that the case against him was \u201cplagued with illegalities, irregularities, unconstitutional behaviour\u201d and he welcomed the chance to fight in court.\n\n\u201cI have prosecuted criminals all of my career, very dangerous criminals and very powerful criminals. I have received death threats,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cI was under permanent police protection for nine years and I was never intimidated. These illegal and arbitrary attempts will not intimidate me, I will fight for what I believe is right, my innocence, until the end.\u201d\n\nArias is famous for his role in investigations into illegal political campaign financing by businesses and influence trafficking by the son of former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, an allegation of which he was eventually acquitted.\n\nHe led multiple raids on the Chilean Catholic Church seeking evidence of historical sexual abuse, seizing thousands of documents to pursue 30 cases of alleged abuse dating back to 2007 that he said the Church had not reported to police.
