(AP Photo/Vincent Yu)\n\nHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong police said Monday that a homemade remote-controlled explosive device intended to \"kill or to harm\" police officers was detonated during protests Sunday, in a further escalation of violence from anti-government unrest now in its fifth month.\n\n\"It exploded less than 2 meters (yards) away from a police vehicle. We have reason to believe that the bomb was meant to target police officers,\" Deputy Commissioner Tang Ping-keung said at a news conference, speaking through a translator.\n\nNo casualties were reported. Tang said it was the first known use of an explosive device during the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into an anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement.\n\nChin-chiu Suryanto, an officer with the police force's bomb-disposal unit, said the device was concocted with a \"highly effective\" explosive.\n\nHe said there was \"a loud thud\" from the detonation Sunday night on a usually busy thoroughfare in Kowloon.\n\nHe said the use of an explosive device marked an escalation in violence seen during the anti-government protests. He likened the use of such a device to \"terrorist events\" seen elsewhere in the world.", "description": "Hong Kong police said Monday that a homemade remote-controlled explosive device intended to \"kill or to harm\" police officers was detonated during protests Sunday, in a further escalation of violence from anti-government unrest now in its fifth month.  \"It exploded less than 2 meters (", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mW5kmLiGMob_XBhBs8h9Rg--~B/aD0zMzYyO3c9NTAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/16e3f2a5dff07ee130394d85756d2e55", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
