Their only defeat in their last eight matches came at Real Madrid and they are top of the table for the first time since the 1973/74 season.\n\n\u2013 Dortmund fail to fire in derby \u2013\n\nIt was honours even in Germany\u2019s Ruhr derby as Schalke held Borussia Dortmund to a goalless draw, but the hosts\u2019 captain Alexander Nuebel claimed the visitors\u2019 star-studded attack did not even try to find a way past him.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult for Dortmund to score a goal, because no one wanted to get into our area,\u201d said the Royal Blues goalkeeper.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get into the danger zone, you won\u2019t score goals. Their lack of ideas gives me a few worries,\u201d said Sky pundit, former Liverpool and Germany midfielder Didi Hamann.\n\nThe result left Dortmund fifth in the Bundesliga, three points behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach and two points behind Bayern Munich in second.\n\nHaving been tipped to make a serious title challenge, pressure is building on Lucien Favre, and Jose Mourinho is reportedly waiting in the wings if the Swiss coach is fired.\n\n\u2013 Marseille no rivals for PSG again \u2013\n\nIt is the biggest fixture in French football but it is a long time since Marseille have been real rivals for Paris Saint-Germain. On Sunday Andre Villas-Boas\u2019s team were blown away, losing 4-0 at the Parc des Princes as their winless run in the \u2018Classique\u2019 stretched to 20 games.\n\nMauro Icardi and Kylian Mbappe both scored twice for PSG, with all the goals coming in the first half. Neymar was again absent, but Angel Di Maria was once again outstanding, setting up two of the goals.\n\nPSG are already eight points clear at the top of Ligue 1 after just 11 matches, while Marseille are seventh.\n\n\u2013 Serie A elite look jaded \u2013\n\nJuventus, Inter Milan and Napoli all settled for Serie A stalemates after showing signs of fatigue on the back of Champions League victories.\n\nInstead it was Atalanta who were the weekend\u2019s big winners, thrashing Udinese 7-1 to put their 5-1 drubbing at Manchester City behind them and move to within three points of leaders Juve.\n\n\u201cEveryone is paying for something in the Champions League,\u201d said Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti after a 1-1 draw against lowly SPAL.\n\nJuventus coach Maurizio Sarri was unhappy with his side\u2019s \u201cscrappy\u201d 1-1 draw against Lecce, which was missed by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\u201cWe needed to be a bit more determined and clinical,\u201d said Sarri.\n\nInter are a point off top spot in second after being held to a 2-2 draw by Parma.\n\n\u2013 Famalicao\u2019s fairytale run ends \u2013\n\nUnheralded Famalicao saw their unbeaten start to the Portuguese season ended as they lost 3-0 on their short trip to face giants Porto on Sunday.\n\nThe newly-promoted side, who owe their rise to the backing of super-agent Jorge Mendes and Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer, have slipped to third in the table, two points behind Porto and Benfica after eight matches.\n\n\u201cThe usual suspects share the leadership,\u201d said sports daily A Bola on Monday morning, with reigning champions Benfica winning 1-0 at Tondela.\n\n\u201cWe were completely outplayed,\u201d admitted Famalicao coach Joao Pedro Sousa, previously the assistant to Marco Silva at Everton.\n\nta-ea-ryj-as/cw", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Granada are surprise leaders in Spain, it was honours even in the Ruhr derby, and Paris Saint-Germain again showed no mercy to old", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/b0a625_alvaro-vadillo-got-goal-granada-top-la-liga-barcelona-real-madrid-out-action-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
