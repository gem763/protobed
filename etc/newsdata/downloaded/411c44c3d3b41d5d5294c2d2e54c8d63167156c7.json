As long as it gets you out the door.\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened to North Carolina mother-of-three Tiara Young.\n\nShe wrote in a Facebook post, which has been shared nearly 100,000 times: \"OK, so boom, my daughter asked can she pack some lotion in her bag and of course I said yeah go get the small travel size out my top drawer. Instead of me checking to make sure she got the right thing, I didn't bc I was in rush.\"\n\nWe've all been there. It's kind of a mad dash in the mornings, and sometimes we forget things, like our lunches. S\u2014t happens, right?\n\nWhen Young's 5-year-old daughter Zoi checked the top drawer for her mom's travel-sized lotion, she grabbed a tube and threw it in her backpack.\n\nAll dressed and packed, it was time to go to school.\n\n15 minutes after drop off, this mom got a phone call.\n\n\"She asked: did I know what she [used] to put on her legs? I told her, 'yeah it's Jergens lotion.'\"\n\n\"This ain't no lotion ma'am,\" said the teacher.\n\n\"I gets to the damn school and see her all shiny, so I'm thinking to myself why tf did she take the baby oil. The teacher pulled out what my daughter was putting on her legs and it was some damn KY.\"\n\nYep, her daughter packed lube and rubbed it all over her legs, thinking it was lotion. And Young, all busy and flustered, totally forgot that her lotion was in the same place as her, well, intimates.\n\nWhen asked why she posted this situation on Facebook, Young told CafeMom, \"I wanted my friends to see how my daughter couldn't wait to embarrass me.\"\n\nWhat's the weirdest thing your kid has ever packed for school? What's the strangest thing your kid's school has called you about? Were you embarrassed, or did you just find it hilarious?
