Biden and his son.\n\nOn Thursday, Pentagon chief spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said Defense Department offices have been instructed to \u201cprovide any pertinent documents and records to the office of general counsel for cataloging and review.\u201d\n\nMr. Hoffman said the step is appropriate because of a \u201csignificant level\u201d of interest from Congress in the matter.\n\nThe Pentagon has been pulled into the mounting controversy because it abruptly put on hold a key shipment of weaponry to Kyiv this summer for reasons that are now under sharp dispute.\n\nIn June, the Defense Department announced plans to provide $250 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including rigid hull boats, rocket propelled grenade launchers, night-vision goggles and sophisticated communications equipment.\n\nBut shortly afterward, Mr. Trump unexpectedly put a hold on the military aid package. Mr. Trump has said concerns about corruption in Ukraine, rather than partisan political considerations, were behind the temporary cash freeze, but a whistleblower account said the president was pressing Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate the Bidens. Mr. Biden a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and currently the front-runner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be supportive of our allies and partners [but] we\u2019re expecting our partners to do more,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said Thursday. \u201cWe want partners and allies to be not only standing with us but to have capabilities when they\u2019re standing with us.\u201d\n\nBut critics say the Defense Department still has not explained why it agreed to the aid freeze after John C. Rood, the undersecretary of defense for policy, in May had sent Congress the legally mandated certification that \u201cthe government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption [and] increasing accountability,\u201d clearing the way for the defense aid package to go forward.\n\nMr. Hoffman said the bulk of the military assistance package has since been released to Ukraine\u2019s government and \u201cthe rest should be out soon.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman also said Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper was not involved in a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when Mr. Zelensky asked for human-portable Javelin missiles that are capable of destroying armored vehicles. The phone call was a critical part of the whistleblower\u2019s narrative.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, no one from the Department of Defense was on that call,\u201d the spokesman told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve specifically asked [Mr. Esper] that question and he was not on that call.\u201d\n\nThe top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Europe seconded Mr. Zelensky\u2019s request. At a press conference Thursday, Air Force General Tod Wolters said he backed supplying additional Javelin missiles to Ukraine, which is battling a Russian-backed separatist movement in its eastern half.\n\nUkrainian officials said the tank-killing Javelin has been vital in the fight. Russian-backed forces in the Donbass Region have been in a state of civil war since Russia forcibly annexed the country\u2019s Crimea region in 2014.\n\n\u201cYeah, I think more of those [Javelin missiles] would probably help,\u201d Gen. Wolters said, according to the military publication Stars and Stripes. \u201cRight now, it is my military advice that I think we should go forward with that because of the positive outcome \u2014 because [the Ukrainians] are better able to [defend] their sovereign territory.\u201d\n\nThe State Department on Thursday also said it now backed a sale of 150 Javelin missiles and support equipment to Ukraine for just under $40 million. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale.\n\n\u201cThis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of Ukraine,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
