It\u2019s not. It was a popcorn-worthy meltdown, but Cuomo has had decent moments where he has pushed back against liberals on his show. Let\u2019s take Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is trying to nab the rabid anti-gunners in a desperate hail Mary to keep his campaign prospects alive. He needed something to keep him in the news. He decided to get behind full-blown gun confiscation.\n\nYes, the government is coming to take your guns. Beto wants it. Deep down most Democrats do\u2014they\u2019re an anti-freedom, anti-gun, anti-Bill of Rights party. It\u2019s exposed now. And the only reason why some Democrats are mad at Beto's rhetoric is due to the fact that he gave away the playbook. He\u2019s milking the airtime, but Cuomo pushed back on Soy Boy Bob\u2019s proposals, citing the Heller decision and the notion that this is the confiscation of private property from law-abiding Americans. It\u2019s not legal. Beto tried to counter by saying that even the late Justice Antonin Scalia noted that no right is absolute and that the ruling also gave way for the government to pass appropriate regulations. That\u2019s true. But confiscating guns from law-abiding Americans, and guns that are common and owned by millions for that matter is not what was being inferred in the ruling.\n\nCNN's Cuomo: \"Are you in fact in favor of gun confiscation?\"\n\n\n\nBeto: \"Yes ... I don't want you, or anyone else to get into the fear-mongering ... that the gov is going come and take your guns\"\n\n\n\nCuomo: \"It's not about fear-mongering. You just said it, Beto\" pic.twitter.com/GshnjrSpHl \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 19, 2019\n\nBeto also tried to downplay his proposal as not government overreach at all, adding that it\u2019s straight fearmongering if someone frames this as Washington stomping in to take your guns. Cuomo quietly reminded the former Democratic congressman that he just said that, however. And to Cuomo\u2019s credit, he did note that the AR-15 is the most commonly owned rifle in America.\n\nBob then went on some paranoid tangent, inferring that our schools are targets and that any day, someone is going to shoot them up. Not true. Schools have never been safer, violent crime is still at historic lows, mass shootings are still rare, and gun homicides remain low as well. That\u2019s the FBI\u2019s data. It\u2019s a fact. America is not a shooting gallery no matter how much liberals lust for it to be so in order to shred our constitutional rights. They need death to be successful on this issue. That\u2019s quite deplorable.\n\nThe landmark Heller decision ruled that there is an individual right to own firearms unconnected to service to a national militia within federal enclaves in 2008. In this case, it was Washington, D.C. The ruling was expanded to the states in 2010 with McDonald v. Chicago.\n\nWatch the full interview below:", "description": ".09/19/2019 19:03:12PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/262/14eef7b9-b758-437c-b2ec-4f67e03ad19f.png", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
