Holmes both shared the letter Sutherland received on Twitter that criticized the defensive back\u2019s hairstyle. The letter asks Sutherland to cut his long dreadlocks to look more \u201cclean-cut\u201d like men from yesteryear.\n\nPAC-12 COMMISSIONER: SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH CALIFORNIA LAW\n\n\u201cSurely there must be mirrors in the locker room! Don\u2019t you have parents or girlfriend who\u2019ve told you those shoulder length dreadlocks look disgusting and are certainly not attractive,\" the letter read.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate you on your game against Pitt but you need to remember you represent all Penn Staters both current and those alumni from years past. We would welcome the reappearance of dress codes for athletes.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which was signed by a Dave Peterson, finally says he and his wife have stopped watching the NFL \u201cdue to the disgusting tattoos, awful hair and immature antics in the end zone. Players should act as though they\u2019ve \u2018been there before.\u2019\u201d\n\nTENNESSEE VOLUNTEERS DISMISS JEREMY BANKS AFTER VIDEO OF SECOND INCIDENT SURFACES\n\nShelton and Holmes both condemned the letter.\n\n\u201cOne of my teammates got this. Explain to me how this isn\u2019t racist,\u201d Shelton tweeted.\n\nHolmes added: \u201cmy teammate got this in the mail today, and tbh Im at a lost for words.. I also have locs, Tats, and NFL dreams too, these messages can not be tolerated, this was extremely inappropriate, racially biased, and selfish to feel like you even have a right to send this message.\u201d\n\nAccording to Penn Live, Sutherland spoke about how his hairstyle originated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my hair for like ten years now, going on ten years,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s become a part of my identity at this point. When I was a kid my mom just braided my hair one day and I just went with it.\u201d\n\nNeither Sutherland nor Penn State has commented on the letter.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPenn State is 5-0 this season and is set to take on Iowa on Saturday.", "description": "Two Penn State Nittany Lions football players on Monday shared a \u201cracist\u201d letter alumni sent their teammate Jonathan Sutherland about his hair.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
