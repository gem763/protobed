Cars raced to safety, although it was not clear if they were leaving the town or heading away from border areas. Near the town of Qamishli, plumes of smoke were seen rising from an area close to the border after activists reported sounds of explosion nearby.\n\nAt least one member of the Kurdish-led force known as the Syrian Democratic Forces was killed in the Turkish bombardment, Kurdish activists and a Syria war monitor said.\n\nTurkey\u2019s campaign \u2014 in which a NATO member is raining down bombs on an area where hundreds of U.S. troops are stationed \u2014 drew immediate criticism and calls for restraint from Europe.\n\n\u201cCoalition forces are not near the places Turkey has struck so far,\u201d an official with the U.S.-led coalition told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Kurdish forces have warned of a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d that could potentially unfold because of the Turkish military operation.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\u201d Erdogan said in a tweet.\n\nHe added that Turkish Armed Forces, together with Turkish-backed Syrian fighters known as the Syrian National Army, had begun what they called \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d against Kurdish fighters to eradicate what Erdogan said was \u201cthe threat of terror\u201d against Turkey.\n\nMinutes before Erdogan\u2019s announcement, Turkish jets began pounding suspected positions of Syrian Kurdish forces in the town of Ras al Ayn, according to Turkish media and Syrian activists. The sound of explosions could be heard in Turkey.\n\nA photograph released to Turkish media showed Erdogan at his desk, reportedly giving orders for the start of the operation.\n\nIt was difficult to know what was hit in the first hours of the operation.\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said Turkish warplanes were targeting \u201ccivilian areas\u201d in northern Syria, causing \u201ca huge panic\u201d in the region.\n\nBefore Turkey\u2019s attack, Syrian Kurdish forces that are allied with the United States issued a general mobilization call, warning of a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe.\u201d.\n\nThe Turkish operation meant to create a so-called \u201csafe zone\u201d carries potential gains and risk for Turkey by getting even more deeply involved in the Syria war. It also would ignite new fighting in Syria\u2019s 8-year-old war, potentially displacing hundreds of thousands.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Shortly after the Turkish operation inside Syria had started, Turkish soldier stand at the border with Syria in Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019.\n\nTurkey has long threatened to attack the Kurdish fighters whom Ankara considers terrorists allied with a Kurdish insurgency in Turkey. AP journalists on the Turkish side of the border overlooking Tal Abyad saw Turkish forces crossing into Syria in military vehicles.\n\nExpectations of an invasion increased after Trump\u2019s announcement, although he also threatened to \u201ctotally destroy and obliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if the Turkish push into Syria went too far.\n\nIn the U.S., Republican critics and others said he was sacrificing an ally, the Syrian Kurdish forces, and undermining Washington\u2019s credibility. Trump tweeted that he is focused on the \u201cBIG PICTURE\u201d that does not include American involvement in \u201cstupid endless wars\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nTurkey \u201chas legitimate security concerns\u201d after suffering \u201chorrendous terrorist attacks\u201d and hosting thousands of refugees, said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nBut he also said in Rome that Turkey should not \u201cfurther destabilize the region\u201d with its military action in Syria.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas condemned the offensive, saying it will \u201cfurther destabilize the region and strengthen IS.\u201d The operation also was criticized by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe EU is paying Turkey 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) to help the country cope with almost 4 million Syrian refugees on its territory in exchange for stopping migrants leaving for Europe. But Ankara seeks more money amid concerns that thousands of Syrians could soon cross its border.\n\nFahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency\u2019s communications director, called on the international community to rally behind Ankara, which he said would also take over the fight against the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkey aimed to \u201cneutralize\u201d Syrian Kurdish militants in northeastern Syria and to \u201cliberate the local population from the yoke of the armed thugs,\u201d Altun wrote in a Washington Post column published Wednesday.\n\nErdogan discussed plans for the incursion by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Erdogan\u2019s office said he told Putin the military action in the region east of the Euphrates River \u201cwill contribute to the peace and stability\u201d and also \u201cpave the way for a political process\u201d in Syria.\n\nIn its call for a general mobilization, the local civilian Kurdish authority known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria asked the global community to live up to its responsibilities as \u201ca humanitarian catastrophe might befall our people.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds also said they want the U.S.-led coalition to set up a no-fly zone in northeastern Syria to protect the civilian population from Turkish airstrikes.\n\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish group urged Moscow to broker and guarantee talks with the Syrian government in Damascus in light of the military operation. The Syrian Kurdish-led administration said it is responding positively to calls from Moscow encouraging the Kurds and the Syrian government to settle their difference through talks.\n\nSyria\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned Turkey\u2019s plans, calling it a \u201cblatant violation\u201d of international law and vowing to repel an incursion. He said some Kurdish groups were being used as a tool to help an alleged \u201cAmerican project,\u201d but added Syria is ready to welcome back its \u201cstray sons if they return to their senses,\u201d referring to the pro-U.S. Kurdish fighters.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Washington of playing \u201cvery dangerous games\u201d with the Syrian Kurds, saying that the U.S. first propped up the Syrian Kurdish \u201cquasi state\u201d in Syria and now is withdrawing its support.\n\n\u201cSuch reckless attitude to this highly sensitive subject can set fire to the entire region, and we have to avoid it at any cost,\u201d he said in Kazakhstan. Russian news media said Moscow communicated that position to Washington.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Local residents cheer and applaud as a convoy of Turkish forces vehicles is driven through the town of Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, at the border between Turkey and Syria, Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2019.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, IS militants targeted a post of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, which was once the de facto IS capital at the height of the militants\u2019 power in the region.\n\nThe SDF, which holds thousands of IS fighters in detention facilities in northeastern Syria, has warned that a Turkish incursion might lead to the resurgence of the extremists. The U.S.-allied Kurdish-led force captured the last IS area controlled by the militants in eastern Syria in March.\n\nIn the IS attack, three suicide bombers struck Kurdish positions in Raqqa. There was no immediate word on casualties. An activist collective known as Raqqa is being Silently Slaughtered reported an exchange of fire and an explosion.\n\nThe Observatory said the attack involved two IS fighters who engaged in a shootout before blowing themselves up.\n\nIS claimed responsibility, saying one of its members killed or wounded 13 SDF members.\n\n___\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.
