The marvellous secret Katarina Johnson-Thompson kept hidden all this time was that she really was capable of being the best in the world.\n\nIncredible, really. Astonishing. And bordering on the inconceivable. Not only because she has struggled so often with the aches of her body and the nags of her past results, but because she had to beat one of the giants of women's sport to do it.\n\nThat being the great Nafi Thiam, the Olympic gold medallist from Belgium and now, as of Thursday night, the former world champion. It had been more than three years since the 25-year-old last lost a heptathlon, right back to May 2016, and by all sensible predictions that wasn't about to change.\n\nGreat Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson claimed heptathlon gold at World Championships\n\nJohnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the women's heptathlon in Doha on Thursday\n\nThe 26-year-old was overcome with emotion after reaching the pinnacle of the sport in Doha\n\nKJT lay flat on her back after the incredible feat, which saw her smash the British record\n\nBut then she got taken apart, bit by bit, seven shades beaten out of her across seven events by a woman who said as recently as May that she felt like an 'impostor' among the elite.\n\nIf what Dina Asher-Smith achieved a night earlier was a fine rendition of a script, then the number Johnson-Thompson did on Thiam was a glorious tale of the unexpected.\n\nThe winning margin was 304 points, secured by an 800m personal best of 2:07.27, but the damage was done long before that final event. It was inflicted by sustained attacks of the highest quality, with further personal bests in the hurdles and, bogglingly, both the shot put and javelin.\n\nWhere once it was quipped that she was a danger to herself with those latter instruments, Johnson-Thompson has learnt to throw respectable distances in the past two years and so, with only the 800m to go, she was 137 points clear. In English, that's a nine-second advantage over an athlete in Thiam whose personal best at the distance is eight seconds slower. In plainer English, game over.\n\nJohnson-Thompson is pictured doing the long jump section of the women's heptathlon\n\nThe 26-year-old Briton is pictured launching her javelin during the heptathlon in Doha\n\nJohnson-Thompson digs deep to complete the final event of the heptathlon - the 800m\n\nJohnson-Thompson's final tally was a remarkable 6,981 points. The British record, set by Jessica Ennis-Hill at London 2012? 6,955. Winning in Doha will never carry the same tariff as what Ennis-Hill did as the face of a home Olympics, but by all other metrics the 26-year-old deserves to avoid those comparisons.\n\nAfter all the injuries from 2014 to 2016, and all the flopped performances from 2015 to 2017, she is out of that shadow, a slog of a decade on from winning the world junior title. She used to be a cruel punchline; now she is the reigning Commonwealth champion, world indoor champion, European indoor champion and, wonderfully, world champion.\n\nThe nuts and bolts of the win were desperately impressive. Her 13.09sec run in the hurdles and 13.86m throw in the shot sat with a season's best 23.08sec in the 200m and a very strong 1.95m clearance in the high jump. Those opening four disciplines put her on 4,138 points, 96 clear of Thiam, who always comes on strong on day two.\n\nThis time, having had calf and elbow problems all year, she didn't. She was a mix of good and decent all day and by her standards, that is mediocre to poor. A Championships calls for personal bests and she had none.\n\nJohnson-Thompson started day two by leaping 6.77m in the long jump \u2013 her best ever under the fatigue conditions of a heptathlon \u2013 while Thiam managed only 6.40m, well down on her best.\n\nHolding the flag of Great Britain aloft, cameras snapped away as she celebrated her success\n\nKJT held off her formidable rival in Doha, Belgian Olympic gold medallist Nafi Thiam (centre)\n\nThat opened the lead to 216 points and the question was how much of it would bleed out during the javelin. But Thiam managed only 48.04m, 11m short of her best, and Johnson-Thompson threw a personal best of 43.93m. She had met the challenge and battered it and battered it some more with another lifetime mark in the 800m.\n\nOnly the hard of feeling wouldn't be delighted for her after her battles. She was a mess after blowing a medal-winning position with three long jump fouls at the worlds in 2015, and she capitulated amid injury to sixth at Rio 2016 having held bronze through five stages. Her physical and mental robustness was written off.\n\nBut how premature. And how wise that move to France in 2017, away from the comforts provided by her mother in Liverpool. The lift has been remarkable and so have the gold medals, though none had come against Thiam. That has now been settled.\n\nWith Laura Muir going through to 1500m final on Thursday night, more gold might yet come to the team. But it will be hard pressed to rival this one for shine.", "description": "RIATH AL-SAMARRAI IN DOHA: After all the squirming and falling and doubting and fouling, the Kat finally let herself out of the bag.
