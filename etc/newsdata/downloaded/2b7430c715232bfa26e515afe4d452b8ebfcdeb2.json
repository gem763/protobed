That unease is exacerbated by global conflicts and crises from Syria and Yemen to Venezuela, from disputes between Israel and the Palestinians to the Pakistan-India standoff over Kashmir.\n\nAll eyes will be watching presidents Donald Trump of the United States and Hassan Rouhani of Iran, whose countries are at the forefront of escalating tensions, to see if they can reduce fears of a confrontation that could impact the Mideast and far beyond. Whether the two will even meet remains in serious doubt.\n\n\"Our fraying world needs international cooperation more than ever, but simply saying it will not make it happen,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. \"Let's face it: We have no time to lose.\"\n\nThis year's General Assembly session, which starts Tuesday and ends Sept. 30, has attracted world leaders from 136 of the 193 U.N. member nations. That large turnout reflects a growing global focus on addressing climate change and the perilous state of peace and security.\n\nOther countries will be represented by ministers and vice presidents \u2014 except Afghanistan, whose leaders are in a hotly contested presidential campaign ahead of Sept. 28 elections, and North Korea, which downgraded its representation from a minister to, likely, its U.N. ambassador. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled plans to attend and are sending ministers.\n\nLast week, Guterres repeated warnings that \"tensions are boiling over.\" The world, he said, \"is at a critical moment on several fronts \u2014 the climate emergency, rising inequality, an increase in hatred and intolerance as well as an alarming number of peace and security challenges.\"\n\nWith so many monarchs, presidents and prime ministers at the U.N. this year, \"we have a chance to advance diplomacy for peace,\" Guterres said. \"This is the moment to cool tensions.\"\n\nWhether that happens remains to be seen. Many diplomats aren't optimistic.\n\n\"It's a challenging time for the United Nations,\" said China's U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, whose nation is embroiled in a protracted dispute with the United States over tariffs. \"We are faced with rising of unilateralism, protectionism, and we are faced with global challenges like climate change, like terrorism, like cybersecurity.\"\n\n\"More importantly,\" he said, \"we are faced with a deficit of trust.\"\n\nAs the world's second-largest economy and a member of the U.N. Security Council, \"China firmly defends multilateralism, and China firmly supports the United Nations,\" Zhang said Friday.\n\nBut divisions among the five council members \u2014 the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France \u2014 have paralyzed action on the eight-year conflict in Syria and other global crises. On global warming, the Trump administration remains at odds with many countries.\n\nThis year, the U.N. has stocked the agenda with a \"Youth Climate Summit\" ahead of a full-on climate summit for world leaders on Monday. That's all happening before the leaders hold their annual meeting in the horseshoe-shaped General Assembly hall starting Tuesday morning.\n\nGuterres will give his state-of-the-world address at the opening, immediately followed by speeches from Trump and other leaders including the presidents of Brazil, Egypt and Turkey. Iran's Rouhani is scheduled to address the assembly Wednesday morning.\n\nThe United Nations is also holding four other summit meetings \u2014 on universal health coverage, progress on the 17 U.N. goals to combat poverty and preserve the environment, new ways to finance economic development, and the situation of developing island nations on the front line of what the U.N. calls a climate emergency.\n\nGuterres has long stressed the links among climate change, conflict and poverty.\n\nU.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said data shows \"how much we have to do on poverty and the other goals.\" The U.N. message, she said, is simple: \"It's time to ratchet up the action that we need to have at the country level.\"", "description": "The planet is getting hotter, and tackling that climate peril will grab the spotlight as world leaders gather for their annual meeting at the United Nations this week facing an undeniable backdrop: rising tensions from the Persian Gulf to Afghanistan and increasing nationalism, inequality and intolerance", "authors": ["Edith M.
