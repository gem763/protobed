He hinted at Kim Jong Un\u2019s threat to take the nuclear stalemate on a \u201cnew path\u201d if the Trump team doesn\u2019t ease up on sanctions choking the economy by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the U.S. whether to hold talks later on,\u201d Kim Myong Gil told reporters in Beijing, the Yonhap News Agency of South Korea quoted him as saying. \u201cIf the U.S. is not well prepared, who knows what terrible incident could happen. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a year of diplomacy and three meetings between Trump and Kim Jong Un, the two sides have yet to agree what they see as North Korea\u2019s denuclearization, let alone draw up a road map to achieve it. While Trump has hailed success in halting North Korea\u2019s tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, Kim\u2019s regime has hinted at a resumption, and fired off a series of shorter-range missiles since May in a show of force.\n\nMorgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman, said that \u201cthe early comments\u201d from North Korea\u2019s delegation \u201cdo not reflect the content or the spirit of today\u2019s 8 1/2-hour discussion.\u201d The U.S. delegation previewed \u201ca number of new initiatives\u201d and accepted a Swedish invitation to continue the talks in two weeks, Ortagus said in a statement.\n\nNorth Korea accused the U.S. of \u201cspreading a completely ungrounded story,\u201d about the future meeting, the state-run Korean Central News Agency quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesperson as saying. \u201cThe U.S. has actually not made any preparations for the negotiations, but sought to meet its political goal of abusing the DPRK-U.S. dialogue for its domestic political events on schedule,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe U.S. point man for the nuclear talks in Stockholm, Stephen Biegun, was due to meet envoys from South Korea and Japan this week in Washington to discuss what happened in Sweden, the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.\n\n\u201cWhen North Korea says that the U.S. came empty-handed, it probably means that the U.S. didn\u2019t meet the minimal requirements that North Korea expected,\u201d said Kim Dong-yub, a North Korea expert at Kyungnam University\u2019s Institute for Far Eastern Studies.\n\nOne of the biggest problems of the process driven by Kim Jong Un and Trump\u2019s direct meetings is that is has given little time to working-level discussions needed to iron out the details of any deal to wind down a nuclear arms program in one of the world\u2019s most secretive states.\n\n\u201cOverall, North Korea cannot pursue any economic development under these kind of sanctions. The U.S. administration knows that sanctions will be in place as long as there are threats from North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities,\u201d said Oh Joon, a former United Nations ambassador for South Korea.\n\nSubmarine Missile\n\nTrump walked out of summit with Kim in February in Hanoi, saying the North Korean leader wanted too much sanctions relief and offered up too little disarmament in return. The U.S. has said that North Korea must first disarm before it can receive aid, a non-starter for Pyongyang, which has said that would be akin to political suicide and leave it vulnerable to a U.S. attack.\n\nNorth Korea has pressed the U.S. to take a step-by-step approach where it receives rewards for moves it makes to dismantle its nuclear and missile programs. The two leaders agreed at a meeting in June the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean Peninsula to restart working-level talks.\n\nLess than 12 hours after it said it agreed to the talks with the U.S. last week, North Korea tested a new, submarine-based ballistic missile. It was the longest-range weapon tested by Pyongyang since November 2017, and South Korea\u2019s military estimated the missile flew 910 kilometers (565 miles) into space before falling into the sea. Trump said the launch wouldn\u2019t derail the discussions.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo offered cautious optimism during a news conference in Athens.\n\n\u201cWe came with a set of ideas,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cWe hope that the North Koreans came with a good spirit and a willingness to try to move forward to implement what President Trump and Chairman Kim agreed to back in Singapore.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Chiara Vasarri, Todd Shields and Ros Krasny.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Jihye Lee in Seoul at jlee2352@bloomberg.net;Shinhye Kang in Seoul at skang24@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Jon Herskovitz\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- North Korea and the U.S. left their first nuclear discussions in eight months disagreeing about what was on the table and showing how far apart Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump still are.North Korea\u2019s nuclear envoy Kim Myong Gil said Monday that the U.S. had arrived \u201cempty-handed\u201d for the", "authors": ["Jihye Lee", "Shinhye Kang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
