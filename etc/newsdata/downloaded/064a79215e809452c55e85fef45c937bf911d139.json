Hill is a Democrat, which probably explains the recent spate of articles from mainstream publications defending polyamory.\n\nCBS News has run two pieces in the past five days lamenting the \u201cstigma\u201d faced by those engaged in \u201cethical non-monogamy\u201d and the attendant lack of \u201clegal protections\u201d for those in such relationships. The push began long before the Hill allegations, in fairness: The New York Times has a veritable library of think pieces from the past few years defending the practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s striking as you read the various arguments for the virtues of polyamorous unions \u2014 each one subtly (or not so subtly) suggesting that such unions ought to be recognized as legitimate marriages \u2014 is their congruence with the undergirding logic employed by the majority in Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nIn his Obergefell dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts noted \u201chow much of the majority\u2019s reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was verboten to say so at the time, the reasoning of Obergefell\u2019s majority \u2014 that the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment guarantees two adults of either sex the right to enter into state-recognized matrimony \u2014 readily lends itself to abolishing other components of the definition of marriage. If sexual difference is not a meaningful feature of marriage, why should the union be restricted to two \u2014 and only two \u2014 people?\n\nA lot of intellectual energy was spent attempting to debunk this supposed red herring. Perhaps the ne plus ultra came via Jonathan Rauch in a Politico article, \u201cNo, Polygamy Isn\u2019t the Next Gay Marriage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRauch\u2019s article took aim at two possible principles that a future court might apply to a legal challenge brought by polygamists: rational basis and strict scrutiny. On the rational-basis front, Rauch cited the body of \u201ctheoretical and empirical literature\u201d that, he argued, demonstrates \u201cthat polygamy has many severe consequences for third parties.\u201d\n\nWhatever the merits of his argument \u2014 and its frightening implication that the only barrier between us and polygamous marriages is the ever-fickle \u201ctheoretical and empirical\u201d social-science literature \u2014 what if, say, one study comes out challenging the academic consensus Rauch portrays? Two studies? Three? Indeed, it wouldn\u2019t take much for a few polygamy sympathizers in the academy to massage the numbers in such a way as to knock down Rauch\u2019s house of cards. More fundamentally, much of what Rauch asserts would happen to a society that legalized polygamy \u2014 marital imbalances between high-status and low-status men, the diminution and objectification of women \u2014 is already manifest today in our hyper-sexualized culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRauch proceeds to address the strict-scrutiny standard, whereby a future court, weighing the merits of polygamous \u201cmarriage,\u201d would consider whether a state\u2019s refusal to recognize polygamous marriages amounts to a violation of the 14th Amendment, as refusal to recognize same-sex marriages did in Obergefell. He answers by citing a handful of tenuous moral arguments and asserts that the polygamist\u2019s \u201ccase is trivially easy to distinguish from [the one underpinning] Obergefell, which was based on a very different kind of moral, social, and legal proposition.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept it\u2019s not at all easy, much less trivially so, to distinguish between the merits of the two propositions. The majority in Obergefell did not find the fact that the West, for at least two millennia, held a stable conception of marriage \u2014 a union between one man and one woman, open to procreation and the rearing of children \u2014 compelling grounds to reject the claims of the plaintiffs. Obergefell clearly conceives of marriage as a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 civil, legal, and moral \u2014 to be extended to consenting claimants, with only passing regard for the existing strictures of the institution. Anthony Kennedy\u2019s opinion uses a nebulous, inchoate definition of marriage predicated on poetic notions of \u201cdignity\u201d and \u201clove\u201d rather than the traditional, unbroken consensus of Western civilization. Why would the Court find the traditional restriction of marriage to a union between two persons a compelling reason to withhold the right to marry from three (or more) claimants?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf \u201clove,\u201d \u201cdignity,\u201d and the pursuant tax advantages are the constitutive parts of marriage, on what grounds would Rauch or the courts withhold those \u201crights\u201d from polygamous unions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of this comes down to Rauch\u2019s say-so. But, like the social science he relies on, society\u2019s \u201cmoral, social, and legal\u201d sensibilities are subject to change as the Singerian \u201cexpanded circle\u201d ethic \u2014Peter Singer\u2019s secular eschatology that conceives of moral progress as an interminable \u201cexpansion\u201d of man\u2019s concern for others, starting from his immediate kin and radiating outward \u2014 dominates our cultural conscience and envelops ever more anomalous and obscure domains of sexual activity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne can imagine a possible path forward. Polygamy will become polyamory, \u201cconsensual nonmonogamy,\u201d or whatever premise-smuggling euphemism its practitioners prefer. Serial philanderers with bizarre unions will become \u201cpolyamorous Americans\u201d whose \u201crights are under assault.\u201d They might get their own letter in the LGBTQ alphabet soup. Opponents will be called prudes, scolds, and deplorables. Beto O\u2019Rourke will seek to strip tax-exempt status from every church that so much as hesitates to affirm the moral rectitude of 14-person marital unions. Every polygamous union in Colorado will insist that Jack Phillips bake their \u201cwedding\u201d cake and drag him before the state\u2019s Civil Rights Commission when he refuses.\n\nJohn, Robert, and Edward Kennedy each saw occasion to appropriate George Bernard Shaw\u2019s play Back to Methuselah when they affirmatively recited a derivative of the Serpent\u2019s temptation of Eve in the Garden: \u201cSome men see things as they are and say, why; I dream things that never were and say, why not.\u201d By the rules they\u2019ve created, why not allow polygamists to get married?", "description": "In Obergefell,John Roberts noted \u201chow much of the majority's reasoning would apply with equal force to the claim of a fundamental right to plural marriage.\u201d", "authors": ["John Hirschauer", "Zachary Evans", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Frederick M.
