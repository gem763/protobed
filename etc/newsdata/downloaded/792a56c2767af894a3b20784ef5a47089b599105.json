The Dow was down over 130 points as investors reacted to a weekend drone attack on a Saudi oil field.

Here are the three main economic risks we face:\n\nIf this attack causes the Saudi facility to be offline for longer than expected, the Saudis may run out of stockpiled supplies to export, and that could cause a shortage that pushes up prices even more.\n\nThere could be additional, similar attacks on Saudi facilities in the future that cause more supply disruptions. After all, whoever was behind this attack (U.S. officials are claiming to have evidence that it was Iran itself , not just Houthi rebels in Yemen backed by Iran) has shown they have the capability to do it. They might be able to do it again.\n\nIf this attack leads to military escalation by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia, that could further disrupt the oil trade in the Gulf region.\n\nThe attack also reduces the likelihood of a positive risk that had appeared to be on the table until a few days ago: If the thaw in the Trump administration\u2019s position toward Iran had persisted, that could have eventually led to a renewed nuclear deal with Iran (or something like it) and to the resumption of significant Iranian oil exports, which would have tended to reduce the price of oil.\n\nYesterday, President Trump tweeted ominously that we were \u201clocked and loaded\u201d and awaiting a Saudi cue on how to respond to the attack, though today he expressed a reluctance to go to war. The latter comment is consistent with his overall approach to foreign tensions \u2014 inclined toward bellicose talk but hesitant to actually launch attacks. In June, Trump called off a planned attack on Iran that would have been a response to actions to disrupt oil shipping that his administration had also blamed on Iran.\n\nOther countervailing factors give us reason to think global oil-supply disruptions might not affect the U.S. economy as much as you would expect. The U.S. now produces about the same amount of oil we consume, unlike in prior decades when we were heavily dependent on oil imports. So while higher oil prices mean painful gasoline price increases for consumers, they also mean job creation and higher income in oil-producing regions of the country. And petroleum products make up a smaller slice of the consumption in our economy than they used to. So while spikes in oil prices caused by external factors have often been drivers of recessions in the past, those risks may not be as acute as they once were.\n\nThis may be one reason that, while oil prices went up massively today, U.S. stocks fell only modestly. The Dow fell just over half a percent and remains within 2 percent of its record high. Today\u2019s move is a signal that investors are troubled by the oil situation but not panicked about it.\n\nStill, trouble in the global oil markets is not good for our economic outlook. Europe remains a major net oil importer, and economic weakness there is already a significant risk factor for the U.S. economy. If the oil situation worsens, so will the knock-on risks to the U.S. The president, who seems terrified about what an economic slowdown would do to his reelection prospects, is likely to be considering that as he weighs how to react to the attack.", "description": "Assessing the economic risks remaining after a missile attack on a major Saudi oil-processing facility knocked about half that country\u2019s production capacity (and 5 percent of the world\u2019s) offline.", "authors": ["Josh Barro"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/16/oil_price.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
