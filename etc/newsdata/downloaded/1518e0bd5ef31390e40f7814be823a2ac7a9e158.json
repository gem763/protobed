Writers should experiment with the novel\u2019s limits and conventions, of course, but then readers have to do their job.\n\nThey might start with \u201cDucks, Newburyport,\u201d by Lucy Ellmann, the 1,000-page single sentence that was just shortlisted for the Booker Prize. After two weeks of embracing (and being embraced by) this monumental novel, I must frankly admit that I did not always live up to its expectations. And, perhaps, \u201cDucks\u201d didn\u2019t always live up to mine, either.\n\nJust physically it requires work. Even after many hours of turning pages, I still haven\u2019t discovered the best way to read a book that is almost as heavy as my dog. (I have a small dog.) I tried holding it upright as I would any normal book \u2014 but that put a lot of undue stress on my upper musculature. (And I\u2019m sorry to report that my upper musculature isn\u2019t much to write home about, especially since I turned 60.) Then I tried balancing it on the edge of a large throw pillow in my lap, but that meant bending my neck and spine in weird ways and resulted in a backache.\n\nRegularly shifting the book\u2019s placement (and my posture) every few pages brought additional lapses in concentration \u2014 and maintaining concentration when you read this book is difficult enough. In fact, I\u2019ll warn you right now: If you have trouble reading for more than five minutes without checking your smartphone, you probably shouldn\u2019t bother.\n\nMost of all, the book requires patience and good cheer; otherwise you may not find your way through the continual and often exasperating redundancies that occur on every one of this book\u2019s pages. Because \u201cDucks\u201d is not (as I originally expected) composed of one very long complex periodic sentence, in which actions develop sequentially. Rather it\u2019s a compound sentence that unfolds as a list, each new idea introduced by the same phrase: \u201cthe fact that.\u201d\n\nThis creates a collagelike, sometimes-random and sometimes-not, postmodern accounting of \u201cfacts\u201d as they occur in the mind (I guess) of an unnamed (I think) middle-aged female protagonist \u2014 a work-at-home pie-and-pastry-baking mother of four. The list accumulates data \u2014 from the protagonist\u2019s memories of her parents, her first (unsuccessful) marriage and her current (successful) one, through reflections on parenting, political turmoil and the historic subjugation of Native Americans, along with incoming news reports from the Pluto flyover, the latest school shootings and the always-mounting manifestations of climate-collapse. Meanwhile, our protagonist produces pies, delivers them to restaurants, makes the standard mommy-runs to and from the school and mall and prepares for a cocktail party that she dreads. This is because while she doesn\u2019t mind inundating herself with all these random thoughts, in front of other people, she\u2019s shy.\n\nThe novel bombards its reader with info-bites \u2014 funny, sad, thoughtful, angry, confused, apocalyptic \u2014 with the ceaseless regularity of a combustion engine. Sometimes the repetition can drive a weak mind (like mine) a bit mad; but every time I was about to put the book down and walk away, I would be struck again by the protagonist\u2019s bright, unpretentious, ironic voice, such as when she reflects on the pleasures and impossibilities of raising children:\n\n\u201cthe fact that you have all these kids as an expression of love, and then the kids start killing your love with all their needs, all the diapers and arguments and blocked eustachian tubes, and busting in on your love life every chance they get, just for a glass of milk and more chocolate chip cookies, the fact that cookies are the real passion-killer, Plutonium isotopes, Gameboys, the fact that maybe there\u2019s a biological purpose to it, the fact that maybe the current kids have an instinct to prevent more kids being born, like eaglets or something, or cuckoos in the nest\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author Lucy Ellmann. (Todd McEwan)\n\nThe narrative voice that drives this inexhaustible and exhausting accumulation of \u201cfacts\u201d is surprisingly interesting, engaging and inventive. Despite the world\u2019s horrors that are always already moving in on her (and us) from every direction, she continually drives herself (and us) forward with a deep, abiding sense of hope that, somehow, we will all be saved from drowning, just as her mother was saved as a young girl while feeding the ducks in Newburyport. Ellmann\u2019s fictional world reminds us, over and over, that yeah, we get it. We live here, too, lady. We feel engulfed, every day when we wake up and every night when we go to bed. Engulfed, engulfed, engulfed. The world just doesn\u2019t quit, does it?\n\n\u201cDucks\u201d will almost certainly be compared with other monumentally difficult books, such as \u201cUlysses\u201d (Ellmann\u2019s father wrote the standard biography of James Joyce \u2014 so big complex novels may be part of her DNA). Or perhaps, more appropriately, William Gaddis\u2019s hilarious novel about failing downward in a country full of people failing upward, \u201cJR.\u201d But it\u2019s possible to read those books as actual stories.\n\nMy biggest failure as a reader of \u201cDucks\u201d (and I\u2019ll have to leave it to posterity to decide if this is my failure or the book\u2019s) was in trying to discern a \u201cfront story.\u201d I steadfastly read forward seeking a way through the facts to any form of narrative sequence. At one point, when the narrator considers making a \u201crun out to Zyker\u2019s right now . . . we need soy sauce,\u201d I actually leaped out of my recliner and shouted, \u201cYes, please!\u201d\n\nThere are efforts to ease the barrage \u2014 and every few dozen pages or so, the reader is escorted on little fugue-narratives (including periods and paragraph indentations) concerning a local mountain lion who, like the protagonist, wants to enjoy her life and children in a world that isn\u2019t dying. But these are the book\u2019s least interesting passages and feel like a gimmick designed to help tie up the story before we reach the final pages.\n\nEarly in this novel (page 323!) the protagonist thinks: \u201cthere\u2019s maybe too much emphasis on facts these days, or maybe there are just too many facts,\u201d and our collective inability to manage the world\u2019s multitudinous and horrific information is clearly what this book is all about.\n\nBut then maybe we don\u2019t need reminding what a mess we\u2019re drowning in. Or maybe it\u2019s just too late.\n\nScott Bradfield is the author of, most recently, \u201cDazzle Resplendent: Adventures of a Misanthropic Dog.\u201d", "description": "Lucy Ellmann\u2019s novel is a 1,000-page single sentence, and it was just shortlisted for the Booker Prize.", "authors": ["Scott Bradfield", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/s62shFVSFzxW6TbzFlYnWyNioQE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RA5C6PWQZUI6TMU3UUUNZAQVJI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
