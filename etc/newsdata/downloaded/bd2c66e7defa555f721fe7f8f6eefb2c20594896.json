Gavin Newsom signed a bill that allows college athletes to earn from their likeness, casting aside decades of NCAA rules that regulated student-athletes from being able to earn money. The NCAA has vowed to fight the legislation as more states line up to consider their own laws similar to what California has enacted.\n\nDonald is on the side of the student-athlete, wanting them to get a piece of the proverbial pie.\n\n\u201cThey bring a lot of money to the university. From TV, from jersey sale and everything \u2026 It\u2019s not too bad for them to get a little piece of that,\u201d Donald told FOX Business.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out there performing and bringing so much money in, why can\u2019t they get a little? I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nDonald was a star in college at Pittsburgh, winning the Chuck Bednarik Award from the Maxwell Football Club following his senior season. The award is given to the nation\u2019s top defensive player.\n\nA concern about allowing college athletes to sign endorsement deals is the disparity it would create not only in the locker room but also among athletic departments. Programs with close ties to major sponsors could well partner, albeit unofficially, athletic scholarships with the chance at sneaker and apparel dollars.\n\nThat might create a system of have and have-not programs, something that doesn\u2019t concern Donald too much. He thinks there is still plenty to go around given the enormity of the money maker that is the NCAA.\n\n\u201cThey can get money like anybody. They still get the TV [money] and the jersey sales,\u201d Donald said.\n\nRecently, Donald got himself into some endorsement money of the old school variety. The five-time Pro Bowl player, who led the NFL with 20.5 sacks a year ago, became a spokesman for Dr. Teal\u2019s line of Epsom salts.\n\nTreatments like this, Donald said, are important for the longevity of the career.\n\nThe 28-year old Donald said he used to tease the veterans about things like Epsom salt soaks and other body maintenance.\n\nNow, he is all about the little things so he can continue to stay in the league and cash those checks.\n\n\u201cJust learning from the veteran guys that you play with and shows you the ropes \u2013 they try to teach you things and show you things how to keep your body going. You just try to do the same thing that can help you and keep you playing,\u201d Donald said.\n\nCLICK TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Aaron Donald said that college athletes should get paid for their likeness.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Aaron-Donald-GettyImages-1179693021.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
