Taylor Jr., a highly respected former diplomat, to become America\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine in June, Mr. Taylor initially hesitated.\n\nHe had left government after decades of service and was serving as the executive vice president of the United States Institute of Peace in Washington. But he had remained involved in the affairs of Ukraine, a country that had particular meaning for him since spending three years there as the American ambassador more than a decade ago in the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nAnd he was concerned about the way President Trump\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine had been pushed out of her job under suspicious circumstances. So was his wife, who urged him not to take the job, he said in his congressional testimony on Tuesday.\n\nA conversation with a person he described as a trusted Republican mentor who had served in government changed his mind. \u201cIf your country asks you to do something, you do it \u2014 if you can be effective,\u201d he recalled his mentor saying.", "description": "William B.
