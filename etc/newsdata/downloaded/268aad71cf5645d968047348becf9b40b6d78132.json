Now it\u2019s a pipe bomb.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recently floated a proposal, dubbed the Safe Importation Action Plan, to allow Americans to use Canada as their personal pharmacy. In Canada, the government dictates the market through price controls, but any drug importation scheme should give Americans pause.\n\nRemember, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stated over and over again that our government cannot vouch for the safety and efficacy of Canadian medicines. Pushing this policy through would needlessly threaten patient health and well-being. And here\u2019s a key fact that\u2019s being ignored: It\u2019s infeasible. Canada simply doesn\u2019t have enough drugs to share with United States.\n\nThe so-called Safe Importation Action Plan offers two paths forward for drug importation. First, states, wholesalers or pharmacists could submit plans for demonstration projects for HHS to review outlining how they would import Health Canada-approved drugs, Second, manufacturers could import versions of existing FDA-approved drugs into the United States.\n\nThe plan sounds reasonable enough, but it\u2019s missing one key variable \u2014 the Canadian government. Neither the Trump administration nor any state that\u2019s been pondering drug importation has ever consulted the Canadian government. Had they done so, they\u2019d see that our neighbors to the north have some serious concerns with the proposal.\n\nCanadian officials have already stated that \u201cCanada does not support actions that could adversely affect the supply of prescription drugs in Canada and potentially raise costs of prescription drugs for Canadians.\u201d What about this statement is unclear?\n\nThese concerns are justified. Canada is just one-tenth the size of the United States with a mere 37 million people. Given the sheer magnitude of the U.S. population \u2014 a whopping 329 million people \u2014 there\u2019s no way Canada could cover drugs for all Americans.\n\nThe strain on the Canadian medicine supply would likely lead to shortages and increased costs for Canadian patients. If Canada filled 10 percent of U.S. prescriptions, Canada\u2019s drug supply would run out in less than eight months, according to one study.\n\nCanada is already facing a serious problem with drug shortages. There are close to 1,800 drugs in short supply, according to Canada\u2019s health ministry. And in a recent survey of more than 1,700 pharmacists, 79 percent said they believed the frequency of drug shortages had \u201cgreatly increased\u201d over the past three to five years.\n\nCanadian pharmacies already struggle to keep popular blood pressure drug Adalat XL on the shelves. And just this month, Canada\u2019s federal government reported a shortage of three major cancer drugs. It\u2019s clear that Canada simply doesn\u2019t have enough drugs to go around.\n\nEven if Canada had an endless supply of treatments, drug importation is dangerous. Though the Trump administration\u2019s new plan states that the drugs would be verified before importation, the Canadian government itself has stated that it cannot guarantee a drug\u2019s effectiveness. Safety cannot be ignored because it is inconvenient.\n\nCounterfeit drugs are very common in foreign markets. In fact, 1-in-10 medications is fake, according to a 2017 report by the World Health Organization. Nevertheless, counterfeit medicine sales add up to billions of dollars a year.\n\nThere are two types of counterfeit medicines. The first are cheap copies of commonly sold drugs masquerading as the real thing. They contain few if any active ingredients and have no quality control. Patients who purchase and ingest these medications may not realize they\u2019re taking ineffective drugs until their health condition fails to improve.\n\nOther counterfeit drugs are composed of potentially deadly substances. Investigators have found counterfeit medicines that contain everything from paint thinner and antifreeze to arsenic and uranium. In Canada, counterfeit drug sales are on the rise. From April 2016 to March 2017 alone, Health Canada seized close to 5,500 packages of counterfeit drugs.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Canada; other developed countries are also plagued by knockoff medicines. In the past decade, authorities have discovered counterfeit versions of two popular HIV treatments circulating in the United Kingdom. Germany also had problems with pharmacies selling counterfeit HIV drugs in 2009.\n\nAccess to high-quality medicines is a crucial issue, but drug importation is not the answer. The Trump administration\u2019s drug importation plan would create more problems than it would solve by jeopardizing Canada\u2019s drug supply and exposing Americans to deadly counterfeits.\n\n\u2022 Peter J.
