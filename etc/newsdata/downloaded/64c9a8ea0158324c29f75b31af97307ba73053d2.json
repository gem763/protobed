I feel, if we improve as a team, I'll be a success too.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nMaguire also said he is not weighed down by the pressure of his fee, which saw him eclipse Liverpool's \u00a375m signing Virgil van Dijk as the world's most expensive defender.\n\n\u201cIt doesn't bother me at all,\" Maguire told Inside United. \"It's something that I can't affect. Leicester wanted to keep me and they are in a great position as a club.\n\n\u201dManchester United wanted to buy me and they came to an agreement. It's probably a good deal for both parties and it's something now where I want to concentrate on my football.\u201d", "description": "Harry Maguire has urged United fans to judge him over time with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side struggling so far this term", "authors": ["David Mcdonnell", "Image", "Getty Images", "Empics Sport"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543280.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Manchester-United-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
