We were sort of fading away to black that last week.\n\nImage caption Decades of dust and debris adorn the dilapidated entrance\n\n\"I didn't see the last show go in [so] I thought I would go and have a last look [in the auditorium].\n\n\"There were hundreds [of people] in... suddenly everybody had a last nostalgia trip.\"\n\nThe final film was DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt.\n\n'Sobbing in the audience'\n\nThe end credits rolled to the Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston soundtrack When You Believe.\n\n\"It always chokes me up when I hear it now,\" said Mr Jones.\n\nImage caption A freezer that once held ice cream still stands in the foyer\n\n\"People would always leave during the credits... but everyone stayed, nobody left and it was really quite choking to see it. I think they stayed to see that curtain close for the last time.\n\n\"The curtain shut and you could hear people sobbing in the audience. People were taking snapshots - with their instamatic cameras back in those days.\n\n\"It was quite a nostalgic moment and everyone was quite choked.\n\n\"I never expected that it would be such a poignant moment for people round here, the final night.\n\n\"I'm glad it didn't die with a whimper, it went out with a bit of glory.\"\n\nNew lease of life\n\nThe council bought the building in 2009 and now plans for it to be changed into a community hall have been submitted to the planning committee for consideration.\n\nIf they are approved, the rear section of the Grade II-listed building, which houses the auditorium and stage, will be demolished.\n\nImage copyright LDRS Image caption The facade has been a Port Talbot landmark since the '30s\n\nA new structure over the same footprint would replace it - with the hope of including a 250-seater hall, cafe, meeting rooms and gym - while the frontage would be restored to its former glory.\n\nMr Jones is thrilled the building could be used by the community again.\n\n\"It's a really iconic building, it's striking from the outside, it's got a beautiful look to it and to have it lit up again, whatever it's going to be, it will be nice to see it again.\"", "description": "Time has stood still inside the Plaza, where the old velvet seats are now covered with shrubs.", "authors": ["Michael Burgess", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11FCA/production/_108647637_plaza4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
