The company gave a total of $600,000 in grants to nine charities across the country in the categories of Wellness, Education, and Arts and Culture. This coming week, USA TODAY NETWORK is collaborating with Facebook to support three of the 2017 grant recipients by live broadcasting fundraising events that will raise money for these organizations.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Poughkeepsie Journal is going live with Poughkeepsie Alliance. Local chefs will be asked to create signature dishes and along the way, user donations will toss obstacles at them. Things like losing their kitchen knives, or only being able to cook in a microwave are not out the question. At the end, a judge will determine the best dishes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Florida Today is going live with Promise in Brevard. They invited local artists, young adults, and community members to help create a mural in just under an hour. They\u2019ll be asking for donations and in turn, donors get to say what they want painted on the mural. The community will literally be coming together to make something beautiful for this local organization.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, The Tennessean and Mary\u2019s Magical Place are teaming up on Facebook Live. Local first responders will go head-to-head to build the best gingerbread house while donations from viewers will throw obstacles at them, making for an interesting competition. Maybe they will lose their icing or maybe they will have to tie their hands together \u2013 you\u2019ll have to tune in to find out.\n\nThese challenges are all in good fun and for a good cause. \u201cThis campaign with Facebook is an exciting way to raise money for charities across our USA TODAY NETWORK local community footprint,\u201d said Andy Yost, CMO, Gannett | USA TODAY NETWORK. \u201cFrom the Gannett Foundation to our corporate social responsibility program \u2018A Community Thrives\u2019, we support empowering community members to take on local challenges and look forward to extending our reach through this Facebook campaign.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like to tune in to any or all of these Live Streams, keep a close eye on Florida Today, The Poughkeepsie Journal, and The Tennessean\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2D0hMfp", "description": "USA TODAY NETWORK launched their new corporate social responsibility program, \u201cA Community Thrives\u201d, this year to empower philanthropic organizations in communities across the country.", "authors": ["Staff", "Usa Today Network Pressroom", "Published P.M.
