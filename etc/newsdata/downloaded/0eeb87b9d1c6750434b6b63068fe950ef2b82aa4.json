France\u2019s own commissioner, Sylvie Goulard, will take on the job of internal-market commissioner, and will be in charge of the bloc\u2019s digital single market. France was one of the first EU countries to implement a tax on multinational tech companies, a topic it views as central to its autonomy.\n\nGoulard \u201cis entrusted with an essential and central economic portfolio in the strategy promoted by Ursula Von der Leyen and the resident of the republic in favor of true European sovereignty,\u201d according to a statement released by the Elysee Palace.\n\nShe\u2019ll also be responsibility for the EU\u2019s increasing -- if still fledgling -- initiatives in the area of defense. France has long sought greater EU ambition in defense, at times irking fellow EU nations and the U.S. that are determined to prevent challenges to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nAs Europe wrestles with the threat of populism at home and the hostility of world powers, the commissioner selections suggests it could be the French prescription, for a stronger state and tighter integration, that is gaining ground at the heart of EU institutions.\n\nEU commercial policy will be in the hands of Phil Hogan of Ireland, which shares France\u2019s traditional desire to protect domestic farmers from overseas competition. Ireland, like France, has also taken a hard line on the need to prevent Brexit from leading to controls on the land border between Britain and the EU.\n\nWith former Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni slated to be in charge of overseeing national budgets, von der Leyen is signaling openness to a French argument for flexibility in applying German-fashioned EU limits on deficits and debt.\n\nClimate protection, whose importance Macron has stressed, will be the responsibility of Dutchman Frans Timmermans in a beefed-up role of executive vice-president in charge of the \u201cEuropean Green Deal.\u201d\n\nWith democratic backsliding in eastern Europe a growing EU preoccupation and France a leading critic of the trend, von der Leyen handed Belgium\u2019s Didier Reynders the rule-of-law portfolio. As Belgian foreign minister, Reynders has helped spearhead EU efforts to strengthen oversight of EU governments\u2019 respect for democratic standards.", "description": "Macron\u2019s Influence Grows as Europe Charts a New Direction", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice4630c77d37fe2181aea7c819f49e116.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
