Trump is adjusting to a new political reality, one that is taking shape in a secure conference room on Capitol Hill, and it is a dangerous one for him: he now faces the very real possibility of impeachment in the House and a trial in the Senate, and just in time for the start of the 2020 election year.\n\nThe other reason to consider Trump\u2019s words this week is because of what is happening around him. In the twenty-four hours between Trump\u2019s \u201clynching\u201d tweet and his \u201chuman scum\u201d tweet, William B. Taylor , Jr., the acting Ambassador to Ukraine, offered the most damning testimony against the President yet in the month-old congressional impeachment inquiry. Taylor, a Vietnam veteran and career Foreign Service officer, was called out of retirement by the Trump Administration to serve in Ukraine after the President fired the previous Ambassador at the behest of his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani . Taylor flew in from Kiev in defiance of a State Department demand that he not co\u00f6perate with the House probe, and he brought with him a fifteen-page opening statement , which offered specific, detailed evidence of the pressure campaign waged by Trump and Giuliani to force Ukrainian officials to investigate the former Vice-President Joe Biden, and which discredited conspiracy theories about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 U.S. election. This campaign, Taylor said, included explicitly linking Ukraine\u2019s willingness to undertake these investigations to nearly four hundred million dollars in security assistance and a Presidential meeting. Trump even personally insisted that the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, announce the probes himself, to put Zelensky \u201cin a public box.\u201d Committee sources told reporters that there were \u201cgasps\u201d in the room when Taylor testified. The diplomat was describing not one but multiple quid pro quos, in which Trump appeared to condition American assistance to a beleaguered, war-torn ally on actions that would be taken for his personal political benefit. Even the Senate Majority Whip, the Republican John Thune, of South Dakota, called the emerging picture \u201cnot a good one\u201d for Trump.\n\nStill, the President\u2019s \u201chuman scum\u201d tweet bears noting. First of all, it is quite simply the language of tyrants and those who aspire to be tyrants. Hitler called his enemies human scum, and so did Stalin. In recent years, the Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro , often referred to as \u201cthe Trump of South America,\u201d denounced refugees as \u201cthe scum of humanity,\u201d and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin , denounced Sergei Skripal, the former spy recently poisoned by Russian agents, in Britain, as a disloyal \u201cscumbag.\u201d The North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un , with whom Trump says he has a \u201clove affair,\u201d executed his uncle after a show trial in which he was called \u201cdespicable human scum . . . worse than a dog.\u201d Kim\u2019s regime, it should be noted, also called Trump\u2019s former national-security adviser John Bolton , who differed with the President on the subject of North Korea, a \u201cbloodsucker\u201d and \u201chuman scum.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, this is not any other moment. The Times has tracked hundreds of insults that Trump has already made since entering public life. He has called his critics \u201cdogs,\u201d \u201closers,\u201d and \u201cenemies of the people\u201d; praised racists and trafficked in casual misogyny; derided people from nations he calls \u201cshithole countries\u201d; and labelled American cities where he is unpopular as rat-infested hellholes. This is not even the first time that Trump has used the word \u201cscum\u201d; in June, 2018, he referred to the lead F.B.I. officials who had investigated him as the \u201cscum on top\u201d of the agency. Perhaps it\u2019s unsurprising, then, that, with such a record, his Never Trumper tweet was not treated as major news (although a Republican House member from Illinois, Adam Kinzinger, did say on CNN that it was \u201cbeneath the office of the Presidency\u201d). Arguably, the tweet was not even his most offensive and inflammatory of the week, a distinction that might belong to Trump\u2019s self-pitying, racially charged, and willfully ahistorical lament, from Tuesday, that the impeachment proceedings against him in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives amounted to \u201ca lynching.\u201d In some ways, these Trumpisms have become so abhorrent\u2014and frequent\u2014that it may be easier to ignore them than to contemplate them.\n\nAt 1:48 p.m. on October 23rd, Donald Trump posted a tweet that, in any other political moment, would be a strong contender for the worst public statement ever made by a President of the United States. Attacking enemies within his own party, Trump wrote, \u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d\n\nFor the first thousand or so days of the Trump Presidency, it has been a near-certainty in Washington that Trump might someday be impeached in the House, but he could never be convicted by the Republican-controlled Senate. And by near-certainty I mean as close to absolutely, a hundred-per-cent positive as is possible in an uncertain world. There might be one or two or five wobbly Republicans, it was believed, but never twenty\u2014the number of votes needed to convict him, assuming all Democrats and Independents also vote for his removal. Essentially, the political world agreed with the premise of Trump\u2019s tweet\u2014that the Never Trump opposition to him within the Republican Party had faded to the point of political irrelevance, leaving those remaining against him within the G.O.P. an outnumbered minority, if not actually \u201con respirators.\u201d\n\nAs a strict matter of numbers, that is still correct. Public polls have shown a dramatic increase in support for impeachment, but largely among Democrats and, increasingly, Independents. Most surveys now find a majority of Americans in favor of Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal from office, but still the number is well below the percentage of Americans who disapprove of his performance as President. Even more significantly, Trump\u2019s backing among Republican voters has yet to suffer much, with fewer than ten per cent of them\u2014so far\u2014saying they would favor impeachment. Republican members of Congress have largely held firm with Trump, too, though each day brings more examples of isolated individuals like Thune and Kinzinger publicly expressing concern. In terms of the Senate, the jury pool that may ultimately be called on to render a verdict on Trump in the Ukraine affair, most Republicans have either stayed resolutely silent or ostentatiously demonstrated their loyalty to Trump. Mitt Romney has been the only Senate Republican to forcefully question Trump\u2019s actions. When Trump furiously attacked Romney over it, not a single one of his Senate colleagues rose to his defense.\n\nAnd yet something does feel different around Washington. Republicans, and not just Trump, seem visibly nervous. \u201cThis is shaping up to be a very dark moment for the Trump White House,\u201d a Republican source close to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the National Journal Hotline\u2019s Josh Kraushaar. Even the Senate vote in an impeachment trial shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted, the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to be a harder choice for more people. Whether that\u2019s enough for enough senators to take decisive action . . . every single move has been in the wrong direction\u201d for Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s early days yet, of course, but since Taylor testified, political operatives have openly struggled to figure out whether this time might really be it. Everyone has his or her own little anecdotal data points, like the veteran Republican who told me he now thinks \u201cthere\u2019s about a twenty-five per cent\u201d chance \u201cthe dam breaks in the Senate and they turn on him and convict,\u201d or the fervent Never Trumper who, buoyed by the recent news, texted me that he was sure \u201cDT will be CONVICTED!\u201d Although, he added, in a nod to a more likely reality, \u201cunless, of course, that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Another Never Trumper, the former Republican senator Jeff Flake, said a couple of weeks ago that thirty-five Republican senators would probably vote to convict the President\u2014if the vote were held in secret. \u201cOnly 7 (!) Republican Senators are ruling out removing Donald Trump\u201d a headline on an article by the CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza read. The Senate Minority Whip, the Democrat Dick Durbin, from Illinois, claimed in a TV interview this week that Republican leaders were having second thoughts about the President.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s outbursts can still produce the shows of loyalty that the insecure President craves. On the same day as his \u201chuman scum\u201d tweet, some two dozen Trump supporters in the House stormed into the closed-door secure facility where the impeachment depositions are being taken and disrupted the planned testimony of a Pentagon official for more than five hours. The representatives complained about the unfairness to the President of taking impeachment testimony in private, which has been Trump\u2019s constant gripe. In fact, it soon was reported that Trump had been in on the stunt before it occurred, and the President took to Twitter to thank the protesting House Republicans afterward for their vigorous defense of him. There is no room for wobbling, as far as Trump is concerned. By Thursday, John Thune appeared to have got that message, and CNN reported that he \u201cwalked back concerns he raised\u201d in the wake of Taylor\u2019s testimony, which Thune now called, in keeping with the Party line, \u201csecondhand information.\u201d He joined other senators, including a number of moderates, such as Ohio\u2019s Rob Portman and Tennessee\u2019s Lamar Alexander, at an Oval Office lunch with the President, the message of which was a not-so-subtle show of \u201cthey\u2019re still with me.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s hateful tweet, not a single Republican senator called him out on it, even as his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, went on Fox News on Thursday morning to underscore the point. Those Republicans working \u201cagainst\u201d the President, she said, are in fact human scum, adding, \u201cThey deserve strong language like that.\u201d\n\nAll of which is to say that Trump was crude in his tweet, but he was also right: his internal enemies in the Republican Party are weak and few in number. For now. One thing missing from all the Republican complaints about impeachment this week, however, was a robust defense of what Trump actually did. And that, in the end, is exactly what the Senate jurors will ultimately have to make up their minds about.", "description": "Susan B.
