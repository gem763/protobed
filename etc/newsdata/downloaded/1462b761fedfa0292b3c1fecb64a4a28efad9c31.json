You will discover these flaws when they\u2019re annoying you from your bed at midnight. It\u2019s the air conditioner that blows too forcefully on your head or the WiFi router blinking brightly. When hotel-room frustration strikes, turn to easy hacks to fix your problems.\n\nTwitter became a helpful resource for travel-hack discovery after user Rick Klau posted a trick he saw on the site years ago that he says has improved every night he has spent in hotel rooms since. The hack: using a hanger to secure light-leaking curtains in your room.\n\nI don't remember who posted this on Twitter a few years ago, but whoever you are: you have improved every night I've spent in a hotel since. pic.twitter.com/NpuuumqHV8 \u2014 Rick Klau (@rklau) October 4, 2019\n\nThe post by Klau, who is a senior operating partner at GV (formerly Google Ventures), resulted in more than 1,600 replies. Some gave other creative answers to Klau\u2019s same problem, such as using binder clips or pen caps or old-fashioned clothespins to secure curtains together. Many of the responses addressed other hotel-specific issues with equally ingenious patches. Here are some of the best they offered.\n\n[The best travel hacks on Reddit]\n\nBlock blinking lights with electrical tape\n\nHotel rooms are filled with electronics that entertain us, provide us WiFi and protect us from fires. Although they\u2019re helpful, they can also be incredibly disruptive if they are flashing lights when you are trying to sleep. They blink and blink and blink, driving you to insanity. The fix? According to multiple tweets: electrical tape. Keep a roll in your suitcase so you can cover any and all light pollution quickly and efficiently without having to unplug all of the electronics in your room.\n\nCombat dry air with a wet towel\n\nHotel-room heating and air conditioning systems can be intense. You may wake up feeling like it\u2019s been years since you had any water, your mouth and skin begging for moisture. Hack a humidifier to fight the dehydration. Twitter user Aaron B suggests soaking a towel with water, wringing it tightly so that it\u2019s not dripping, then hanging it over an ironing board in front of your room\u2019s vent or heater.\n\nSoak a towel. Wring it a little tight so it\u2019s not pouring off the towel. Hang it over the ironing board in front of the vent/heater. No more dry hotel room. \u2014 Aaron B \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f (@steamin) October 4, 2019\n\nScore free phone chargers at the front desk\n\nLeft your phone charger at home? Lose it in a taxi cab? Head to the front desk. One Twitter user\u2019s ethically questionable Band-Aid is to ask hotel staff if any chargers have been turned in to the lost and found. If you\u2019re lucky, \u201cthey have a box full,\u201d @Vinylrabbit wrote.\n\nMy hotel hack is if you ever need an extra phone charger ask the front desk if they found one. They have a box full. \u2014 Rabbit (@vinylrabbit) October 4, 2019\n\n[Tell us what you think of By The Way]\n\nOverride the hotel thermostat\n\nFor those who find the temperature options of a hotel room too limiting, this hack is for you. Jillian Hurley cited a Lifehacker story in a tweet about overriding the hotel thermostat. Step one is to hold down the thermostat\u2019s \u201cdisplay\u201d button, then press the \u201coff\u201d button simultaneously. Keep holding the display button down, but let go of the off button and press the up arrow. Once you release all of the buttons, you\u2019ll have free rein of the temperature controls.\n\nOverriding the hotel thermostat is my go-to hotel hack.\n\n\n\nI also put duct tape over the motion sensor so I can be comfortable at night. https://t.co/IxHyQQFkBy pic.twitter.com/0nKdvBWHS1 \u2014 Jillian Hurley (@BeautyBind) October 4, 2019\n\nAvoid the germs of the remote control\n\nIf the thought of grabbing the same gadget used by the countless customers that stayed in your hotel before you freaks you out, cover it up using other items found around the room. One Twitter user recommended using the plastic bag of an ice bucket, while another suggested a shower cap.\n\nUse the ice bag to cover the TV remote\u2019s germs https://t.co/7XeSiJBnEv pic.twitter.com/7jGBENdPJY \u2014 \ud83c\udd72\ud83c\udd77\ud83c\udd78\ud83c\udd7f \ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udd81\ud83c\udd7e\ud83c\udd86\ud83c\udd7d (@ChipBrown) October 4, 2019\n\nKeeping the power on without using your room key\n\nIn an effort to conserve electricity, hotels sometimes require guests to put their key card in a slot near the front door of their room to turn the power on. If you leave, you\u2019ll need your key, therefore preventing you from wasting energy while you\u2019re out. But if you need power for something even if you\u2019re not in the room, try Twitter user Jay Harris\u2019s recommended hack. \u201cNot many people realise you can use any card to keep the power on,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIf we're posting hotel tricks, not many people realise you can use any card to keep the power on pic.twitter.com/u4TNsAyOcO \u2014 Jay Harris (@JayHarris_Sec) October 4, 2019\n\nUnfortunately, not all hacks will work in all hotel situations. Some tweets lamented hotels that don\u2019t allow guests to remove hangers from the closet, or windows with such bizarre placement and drapery that no hanger could ever stand a chance to help. Or that some key cards are different sizes than a standard credit card, so you won\u2019t be able to hack the power in your room after all. But overall, the fixes are helpful to keep in your back pocket in case of emergency.\n\nDo you have any hotel hacks we missed?
