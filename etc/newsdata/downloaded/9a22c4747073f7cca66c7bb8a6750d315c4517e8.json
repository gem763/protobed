But a new interactive gun map of NSW is showing that gun ownership isn't something that was neatly wiped off the map in Australia.\n\nThe heat map, created by the NSW Greens, displays the amount of registered owners, the amount of firearms in total, the average per owner as well as the owner with the highest total. It offers both a suburb breakdown as well as electoral division but it won't tell you where the guns are located specifically.\n\nBreakdown of gun owners in the Sydney electorate.

In 2017, there were 810,023 registered firearms recorded in the NSW database but the map provides the 2019 data for suburbs to show changes over time. Sydney's postcode, 2000, registered a 35 gun increase between 2017 and 2019.\n\nSydney suburb gun owner breakdown.
