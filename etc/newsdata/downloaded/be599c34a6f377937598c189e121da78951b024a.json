He\u2019s also the director of the upcoming film Joker which no one is mistaking for a comedy. In a Vanity Fair feature about Joaquin Phoenix, Phillips explains why he moved from broad comedy to a gritty, realistic story of a deranged killer:\n\nPhillips had found it increasingly difficult, he says, to make comedies in the new \u201cwoke\u201d Hollywood, and his brand of irreverent bro humor has lost favor. \u201cGo try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were articles written about why comedies don\u2019t work anymore\u2014I\u2019ll tell you why, because all the f**king funny guys are like, \u2018F**k this shit, because I don\u2019t want to offend you.\u2019 It\u2019s hard to argue with 30 million people on Twitter. You just can\u2019t do it, right? So you just go, \u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019 I\u2019m out, and you know what? With all my comedies\u2014I think that what comedies in general all have in common\u2014is they\u2019re irreverent. So I go, \u2018How do I do something irreverent, but fuck comedy? Oh I know, let\u2019s take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this.\u2019 And so that\u2019s really where that came from.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that a significant number of top comics have said cancel culture (or political correctness) creates a problem for comedy, there is a coterie of progressives in the media who appear desperate to dissuade you of the notion that cancel culture is worth worrying about. Naturally, those people are coming down hard on Todd Phillips. From Esquire:\n\nComplaints about \u201cwoke culture\u201d are coming fast right now, and they\u2019re generally lodged by people who are furious you\u2019re not laughing at their jokes. The world\u2019s Todd Phillipses can\u2019t do what they used to do, or else they\u2019d be cancelled, because, as they argue, we\u2019re living in \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Never mind that we haven\u2019t defined what cancellation actually looks like, we haven\u2019t lost anybody to it either. How are we living in \u201ccancel culture\u201d if everyone\u2019s still here?\n\nThis is a kind of sibling to the pro-Antifa argument, i.e. how bad can they be if no one is dead? Actually, they can be really bad. They can be assaulting people, setting fires, doing extensive property damage, and generally behaving like the Joker\u2019s minions in public. The fact that no one has been killed by them yet doesn\u2019t mean we should blithely ignore a group organized to commit political street violence. And as the author of the Esquire piece eventually admits, not everyone canceled by cancel culture is still here.\n\nNow, true: Shane Gillis\u2019 racist podcast chatter did end his SNL career before it started, which was a surprise because usually Lorne Michaels only prematurely cans people for saying fuggin\u2019 after midnight, or suggesting that OJ Simpson is a murderer. Roseanne Barr has definitely been banished from her ABC sitcom for Ambien-tweeting. I\u2019m trying to obey comedy\u2019s rule of threes here and name a third person who offended the liberal elites and got pushed out on a cultural ice floe, but I can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s true that cancel culture has only claimed a handful of high-profile scalps at this point. That\u2019s because it\u2019s still made up of a relatively small fraction of the overall population. They may seem numerous on Twitter but they don\u2019t really have the power, at this moment, to enforce their wishes. So, when cancel culture comes after Dave Chappelle, Chappelle survives. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t a pernicious force or that everyone who encounters cancel culture can shrug it off so easily. Jesse Singal wrote about a few lower-profile examples last week:\n\nLast year, a woman in Portland was widely portrayed as racist for \u2014 the story went \u2014 calling the cops on a black guy whose parked car was blocking a crosswalk. The tabloidish headlines helped turn the outrage meter to 11: \u201c\u2018CROSSWALK CATHY\u2019: WHITE WOMAN ALLEGEDLY CALLS COPS ON BLACK COUPLE FOR PARKING JOB\u201d (Newsweek); \u201c\u2018Crosswalk Cathy:\u2019 Woman calls the Bureau of Transportation on couple for bad parking job\u201d (Yahoo); \u201c#CrosswalkCathy Calls Police on Black Man Because She Didn\u2019t Like The Way He Parked\u201d (The Root). Except, if one believes in the laws of time and space, it\u2019s impossible she was motivated by race, because she reported the car (to a non-police hotline) before knowing who the driver was. Didn\u2019t matter: Online outrage has its own sets of laws and rules, and a bunch of idiot internet vigilantes quickly went to work doxxing \u201cCrosswalk Cathy\u201d and attempting to make her life a living hell. Remarkably, many of the articles with loud, racism-accusing headlines related the timeline of the incident accurately in their actual bodies \u2014 meaning writers or editors or web producers must have known exactly what they were doing in playing up a clickbaity, outrage-fomenting, chronologically impossible race angle. Even more remarkably, many of these outlets still haven\u2019t corrected the false claim that \u201cCrosswalk Cathy\u201d called the cops rather than a non-police number, which matters a lot in this context. This all feels like a pretty good example of \u201ccancel culture\u201d! At Yale, there was a somewhat similar controversy earlier in 2018: A grad student called campus police on a black woman sleeping in a student lounge. A bunch of news outlets and Yale activists and a furious band of Twitter users, outraged at this seemingly bigoted act, responded in a way that can only be interpreted as an attempt to destroy the grad student in question. Except that story, too, was a lot more complicated than it initially appeared. It\u2019s a long one, well-told by Cathy Young, involving trauma and mental illness and all sorts of strife and misunderstanding, but it\u2019s just impossible \u2014 I mean that \u2014 to learn the details and remain confident this was, at root, about race rather than a host of other stuff. (Which is not to say, of course, that other, similar situations aren\u2019t about race; of course people get harassed because of their race, all the time.) As a final example of how brutal these outrage campaigns can get, there\u2019s the case of the Steven Universe fan artist who was bullied to the point of a suicide attempt for drawing cartoon characters too fat or too skinny or the wrong color or whatever else. Once the online mob decided she had sinned against the show, and against social justice (conveniently, there\u2019s always a super-important principle at stake to justify sociopathic online behavior), no punishment was too harsh. It\u2019s a very hard story to read, but I hope people click that link.\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that many of the people complaining about cancel culture are comedians (or people connected to comedy like director Todd Phillips). They are the canaries in the coal mine. And, true, most of them aren\u2019t dead but they are taking real hits to their careers (check out the top critics response to Chappelle\u2019s latest special). In response, they are letting us know that something foul seems to be clouding the atmosphere. Maybe those warnings will turn out to be overblown in the long run. Maybe cancel culture will fade away. I certainly hope so. But it\u2019s also possible that what is mostly an irritant now could become far more concentrated and toxic over the next decade.", "description": "\"Go try to be funny nowadays with this woke culture.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Joker-Phoenix.jpg"}
