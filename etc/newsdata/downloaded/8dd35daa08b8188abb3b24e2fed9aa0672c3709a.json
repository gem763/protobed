The events are timed to coincide with the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots of 1969, widely considered to have launched the modern pride movement.\n\nThe document is co-signed by Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi, the head of the education department, and Archbishop Angelo Vincenzo Zani, the secretary. Pope Francis did not sign it.\n\nIn the past, the pope has expressed sympathy for LGBTQ people.\n\n\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\" Francis said in 2013. And later, he said the church should apologize to gays and other marginalized groups.\n\nBut that support has not extended to transgender individuals, whose gender identity does not match the sex they were identified as having at birth.\n\nIn the 2015 book This Economy Kills: Pope Francis on Capitalism and Social Justice, Francis is quoted comparing gender theory, which allows one's identity to exist along a spectrum, to nuclear arms annihilation.\n\nOn Monday, the Rev. James Martin, a writer and Jesuit priest, tweeted that while the Vatican document rightly calls for listening and dialogue, it \"sets aside the real-life experiences of LGBT people.\"\n\n\"Sadly, it will be used as a cudgel against transgender people, and an excuse to argue that they shouldn't even exist,\" he wrote.", "description": "The document entitled \"Male and Female He Created Them,\" laments what it calls an \"educational crisis\" around sexuality and reaffirming the church's traditional stance on gender identity.", "authors": ["Amy Held"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/06/10/ap_19160329818573_wide-65fd86e46320732ddc1f948ebc8dfa42a5de3f99.jpg?s=1400"}
