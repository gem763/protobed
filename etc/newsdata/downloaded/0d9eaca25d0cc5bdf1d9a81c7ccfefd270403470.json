The announcement was met with uncertainty over how it would change the way we use Instagram. But after a couple of months in testing, people appear to love it.\n\n\u201cWithout seeing the likes count on feed posts now, I find myself more clearly focused on the actual quality of the content being posted,\u201d user Matt Dusenbury tells me over Instagram direct message.\n\nPeople in the test group can still see the number of likes their posts garnered, so long as they tap through it. Everyone else, however, cannot. Instagram says the goal is to make people \u201cfocus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get,\u201d and people are automatically included in the test. They can opt out, however. The company has yet to share any data on how effective hiding likes has been on people\u2019s posting habits, but last week, it expanded the test to six more countries, suggesting encouraging results.\n\nThe test is running in seven countries\n\nEmily Hall, another user, says she took a break from Instagram before the likes test rolled out. Now when she posts, she isn\u2019t \u201cobsessed with the number of likes I\u2019d received,\u201d she tells me over DM. \u201cI think that\u2019s because I knew that other people seeing my photos weren\u2019t able to judge me preemptively on the number of likes I had on my photo or the likes versus the amount of time a photo had been posted.\u201d\n\nBoth Hall and Dusenbury worry that users care more about the number at the bottom of a post than the post itself and say the hidden like count allows people to remain focused on the photos. \u201cI\u2019m less prone to pre-judge something by looking at the number of likes first and the actual photo second,\u201d Dusenbury said. \u201cFrom the opposite side, there\u2019s less pressure to post the perfect pic in hopes of amazing Likes, which I find refreshing.\u201d\n\nThe people I spoke with said they feel freer to post what they want, rather than what they know will get lots of likes. Another user, Nikola Lubura, says he used to shy away from posting photos of himself, but he\u2019s more confident now that he doesn\u2019t worry about people seeing his like count. \u201cNow I don\u2019t focus on the number but the people,\u201d he says. \u201cI look and see who liked my post and not how many. Before it felt like one huge competition and now it\u2019s relaxing and freeing.\u201d\n\nThe lack of a like count is \u2018\u201crefreshing\u201d\n\nFor businesses or creators, the change hasn\u2019t made much of a difference. Their accounts still give them highly detailed metrics, down to how many people unfollowed their account on a specific day. Plus, they can still see the number of likes on their own content and track it.\n\nBrenda Cardenas, who makes augmented reality face filters for Instagram, says these metrics make her more aware of her content, much more than likes ever did. One week, she posted more personal content about her workload, and she began seeing higher-than-usual unfollows, which made her think her content was bad. In actuality, the photos performed well and had lots of likes. \u201cWithout seeing that info, and only seeing the unfollows, it left a bad feeling,\u201d she says over DM. \u201cRemoving data is not the solution to removing pressure.\u201d\n\nCardenas can still view her own likes, of course. But when she\u2019s looking at her analytics, she focuses more on unfollows and her overall account than any individual post. As reporter Kaitlyn Tiffany points out in The Goods by Vox, hiding likes doesn\u2019t doom influencers to a sponsor-free life. The data around likes and engagement still lives on the platform, just as it always has. The only difference is that users know their like count is hidden.\n\nLikes have been integral to Instagram since the beginning; they\u2019ve built people up and torn them down. They\u2019ve served as a validator for content. Although hiding likes could have been an abrupt, unwelcome change, users appear to be loving it, and it might become one of the most profound changes the platform has made in years.", "description": "Instagram is testing a feature in seven countries that hides public like counts on posts.
