Now through October 20, the big-box electronics retailer is offering the deals through its Magnolia subsidiary, which puts forth many of the premium (read: expensive) TVs and other products. All of these Best Buy TV deals cost $1,500 or more even with the current discounts.\n\nSo if you are simply in the market for a cheap TV deal and aren\u2019t picky about having the latest features and specifications, you\u2019re probably better off waiting until Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\n\nBut right now shoppers who do want premium TVs and other electrics can save as much as $2,000 on high-end models through Best Buy\u2019s Magnolia Anniversary sale. And the deals come with a special promise: If you buy one of these select items on sale now and the product\u2019s price is cut lower anytime through December 1, 2019, Best Buy will refund you the difference.\n\nIn order to take advantage of the deal and be eligible for the theoretical discount, you must be a member of the retailer\u2019s \u201cMy Best Buy\u201d rewards program. Signing up for a basic account is free and easy.\n\nAs CNET points out, Best Buy\u2019s TV sale prices are currently being matched by Amazon. But if you purchase one of these TVs on Amazon there is no built-in guarantee that it will refund you the difference if prices drop further. (Then again, for that matter, there is no guarantee that prices for these TVs will fall in the weeks ahead.)\n\nHere are a few of the biggest Best Buy discounts you can score on premium TVs right now, and with the money you save you might be able to budget for some quality splurges:\n\nLG 75\u2033 Smart 4K UHD with HDR, was $2,699.99, now just under $2,000 at Best Buy and Amazon\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy More\n\nSony 55\u2033 Smart 4K UHD with HDR, was $2,299.99, now just under $1,500 at Best Buy and Amazon\n\nCourtesy of Amazon More\n\nSony 75\u2033 Smart 4K UHD with HDR, was $3,299.99, now just under $2,500 at Best Buy and Amazon\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy More", "description": "Black Friday pricing guarantee is available for a limited time.", "authors": ["Alix Langone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DESAnnDAUN0qJs8EexCRMg--~B/aD0zNDU5O3c9NTIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/01fc3eb7cb5cd734952eb2b76da171e4", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
