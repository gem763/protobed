Scottish Rugby hope that, if necessary, Scotland\u2019s Pool A meeting with Japan in Yokohama \u2013 threatened by Typhoon Hagibis \u2013 can be played behind closed doors.\n\nThe nation\u2019s footballers, meanwhile, have already been blown irretrievably off course for Euro 2020 qualification from Group I by Belgium and Russia and will face the world\u2019s worst team before a vestigial assembly at Hampden Park on Sunday evening.\n\nWhen the visit of San Marino was marked down for a 5pm kick-off, the Scottish Football Association\u2019s hope was that, if the Scots were still realistic contenders, Tartan Army detachments from the Highlands and Borders would get home at a respectable hour before another working day.\n\nScotland\u2019s smallest home crowd for a qualifier is 11,375, at a 1976 European Championships qualifying match against Romania on December 17, 1975, when Christmas shopping and expenditure took its toll of the attendance. No such mitigation will be offered on this occasion. Seven games into a 10-match schedule, Scotland\u2019s ambition in the group has been snuffed out.\n\nThe SFA board members must be profoundly grateful for the possibility that they can yet attend the Euro 2020 finals \u2013 three games of which will be hosted at Hampden \u2013 via the byzantine process of the Nations League playoffs, in which Steve Clarke\u2019s players have a semi-final date in March against Norway or Serbia or one from the quartet of Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania.", "description": "The world is ill-divided, as the song says.", "authors": ["Roddy Forsyth", "Scottish Football Correspondent", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212830781-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7EcszVNSIqRMQWLIR1XF_68.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
