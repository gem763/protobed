But there is hollowness in policymaking. After an apparent reset of relations with business a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister has revealed his populist business bashing streak.\n\nAfter the \u201cbig stick\u201d to break up the energy companies, now it is the overheated language of bank \u201cprofiteering\u201d \u2013 which emotively conveys exploitation of ScoMo\u2019s little guys.\n\nBy not passing on to borrowers all of this week\u2019s cash rate cut, banks are defending their margins in an abnormal, low rate world \u2013 and protecting the retiree investors and depositors who helped Mr Morrison to victory.\n\nAnd here are two sectors \u2013 finance and energy \u2013 which will be critical if the economy is to return to growth. The election was won by pushing back on irresponsible Labor taxing and spending. Yet this government has been chilling bank lending and killing investment in energy because it too has put populist politics first.\n\nPerhaps that is why it\u2019s no surprise, as political editor Phillip Coorey writes in the Power Issue, that \u201cthe signature challenge to Morrison\u2019s power is coming from the business community\u201d.\n\nNor is it any coincidence that after a decade of leadership madness and policy failure in Canberra from which Mr Morrison emerged, three of the places on the Overt power list have gone to econocrats or business people who would arguably not be there if the government was more on the front foot on the economy.\n\nThere is very untraditional tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes, who typifies business leaders now filling vacuums that the government does not want to talk about much \u2013 in his case energy policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has, within a matter of months, become the activist central banker, cutting interest rates for a third time to drive down unemployment and generate more growth. He has been at pains to explain that his monetary levers can do only so much, openly putting pressure on the government to step up more.\n\nAnd competition regulator Rod Sims of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has shown he is willing to take on market power and reshape industries, including an important world-first inquiry into social media\u2019s impact on independent media and news journalism.\n\nMr Morrison has begun mending his fences with business. And after a decade of chaos, party politics is now normalising.\n\nIt was NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, a high No 3 on the Overt list, who in March re-established the principle that a government performing well should get returned to office. Ms Berejiklian\u2019s state election win politically validated predecessor Mike Baird\u2019s code-breaking formula for using the proceeds from privatising mature assets such as electricity supply and ports to pay for needed catch-up infrastructure investment in roads and rail. Her come-from-behind win became the template for Mr Morrison in May. Her technocratic leadership style may sometimes lack political nous. But in the end, she stayed in office by delivering on policy.\n\nIf Mr Morrison is to use the power as well as win the politics, as did long-lived predecessors like John Howard, then he has to leave the slogans and pick up the policies that will generate growth and protect prosperity.", "description": "The PM has a grip on his job that eluded his predecessors.
