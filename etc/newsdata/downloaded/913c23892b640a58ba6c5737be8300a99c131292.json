So, instead of being one over par, Siem, was in fact 11 over and, having arrived in Versailles desperate for a good finish to help him retain his card, that was more than the 39-year-old could stomach and he immediately walked in.\u200b\n\nAnd with the pacesetters \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s Ryan Fox and South African George Coetzee on six under, that was probably a wise choice on behalf of a player ranked 794th in the world and without a top 10 in two years. \u201cIt was a little too much for me and I disqualified myself,\u201d Siem wrote on Facebook. \u201cI thought I owed you all the explanation.\u201d\u200b", "description": "It was not quite the 58-shot penalty suffered by Lee Anne Walker at the Senior LPGA Championship, but Marcel Siem\u2019s 10-shot infraction at the French Open on Thursday ensured this week would be remembered for eye-watering and scorecard-ruining sanctions.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/17/213286535_Getty-Images-Europe_Open-de-France-Day-One-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqhtgj1VGjO3cWNUVd3sO8sfKY1o4AuatRd0MlH7l7VdM.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
