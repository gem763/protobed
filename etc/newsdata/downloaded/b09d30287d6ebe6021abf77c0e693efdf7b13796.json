He reportedly did not provide details about how the people died.\n\nWeeks after his admission, Qari was called by the Kuchar County Public Security Bureau\u2019s disciplinary office for questioning, before being taken to prison on charges of \u201crevealing state secrets\u201d and for further investigation.\n\nRFA contacted the Kuchar County Public Security Bureau, where an officer confirmed that he and his colleagues had been \u201cdiligently studying \u2018police educational films\u2019\u201d and that \u201cHimit Qari is one of the people featured in the films.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is the political commissar of the Ucha Township Police Station \u2014 around 45 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was detained because he expressed sympathy towards detainees who died in the camp.\u201d\n\nChinese officials have long sought to silence criticism of their policy, claiming it is a necessary measure to tackle terrorism following various Islamist inspired attacks over the past decades. They claim that the concentration camps are \u201cvoluntary de-radicalization camps\u201d and \u201cvocational training centers,\u201d now believed to hold as many as three million Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities.\n\nAccording to countless witness testimonies and human rights investigations, the centers more closely resemble concentration camps, with detainees being indoctrinated in support of the Chinese communist regime and coerced into disavowing their allegiance to Islam.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Washington Post, female victims recounted how Chinese authorities used rape, forced abortions, and the harvesting of organs, while also accusing them of carrying out a \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Uyghur people.\n\nThis month, the U.S. Commerce Department announced sanctions against 28 Chinese entities involved in human rights violations against the Uyghur population, arguing that they were all \u201cimplicated in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "A police chief in Xinjiang has been arrested by authorities over the mass detention of Uyghurs in concentration camps.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Chinese-flag-barbed-wire-housing-compound-Xinjiang-China-Uighur-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
