Caretaker manager Adam Barrett said: \u201cNeil phoned me while I was watching my boy play football for his school. He told me he was resigning and that he wanted me to take the game. It hit me like a ton of bricks. He came in on Friday and spoke to the staff and the players. I\u2019ll always be in contact with him and be forever grateful to him.\u201d\u200b\n\nThe new era began well against Leeds, who played with 10 men for more than 70 minutes. \u201cTo stand here and get a win for him means an awful lot.
