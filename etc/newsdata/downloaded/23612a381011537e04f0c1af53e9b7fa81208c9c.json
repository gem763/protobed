I would be devastated if they were to see this man with no trousers on.'\n\nAt Manchester Crown Court, Condron who lives alone in a 1950s semi-detached house, admitted three charges of indecent exposure and breaching a 2015 Sexual Harm Prevention Order which had banned him for five years from being 'visible to any person whilst naked.'\n\nHe is currently undergoing hormone treatment to reduce his testosterone levels in a bid to curb his behaviour.\n\nCondron is currently undergoing hormone treatment to reduce his testosterone levels in a bid to curb his behaviour\n\nThe latest incidents occurred between October 2018 and April 2019 after Condron had previously been reported to police for other flashing offences.\n\nProsecutor Nicholas Clarke said: 'One of the neighbours said this defendant had been exposing his penis to her when she opened the blinds in the morning, as part of her normal routine.\n\n'She would see Bernard Condron behind a set of French doors holding his penis and she said over a two-month period it happened almost every day.\n\nHe added: 'She indicated she had since had to change her life around him.\n\n'She was aware because she brought her niece into her house, and was concerned that Condron was effectively waiting for her in the morning to open the blinds. He had been sitting in his chair and when the blinds were moved, he would jump up with his penis out for 20 minutes or so.\n\n'This happened almost every day for two months. She called the police and he was arrested.\n\n'He was bailed whist a psychiatrist was instructed to deal with his dementia but he was arrested again over an incident on April 27 when another neighbour was in her bathroom and about to have a shower when she looked out and saw Bernard Condron stood outside with no trousers on.'\n\nCondron watched her from the window wearing only a t-shirt.\n\nMr Clarke added: 'She closed the blinds, had a shower and got dressed.\n\nAt Manchester Crown Court (pictured), Condron admitted three charges of indecent exposure and breaching a 2015 Sexual Harm Prevention Order\n\n'Afterwards, she came downstairs and confronted him shouting: \"What do you think you're doing.\" But he didn't reply and he closed his door and put the blinds down.'\n\n'One of the women said she just wants him to stop. This was a persistent breach, almost daily over the course of two months.'\n\nDefence counsel Julian Goode said: 'This man is 75, he is a man of poor health mentally and physically.\n\n'Medical treatment has been offered which will make this kind of conduct less likely as it will reduce testosterone levels, reduce sexual inclination and reduce the ability to obtain and maintain an erection.\n\n'The neighbours all want this to stop and he is very, very concerned about his behaviour and does wish deeply that his actions will stop too. He is looking at hormone treatment to stop these actions. Any repetition of exposing himself, then he faces a significant custodial sentence on the next occasion.'\n\nDeferring sentence for six months, Judge Alan Conrad QC told Condron: 'I am not making any promises.\n\n'If you stay out of trouble and behave in a way without upsetting any neighbours, there is a chance I won't send you to prison.\n\n'But if you start to expose yourself, you will be going to custody. Carry on with your medical treatment.'", "description": "Bernard Condron, who has dementia, would wait until his victims had got out of bed and would then leap in front of his French windows in Salford, Greater Manchester, and flash them.", "authors": ["Jemma Carr For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/19982498-0-image-a-25_1571648179501.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
