In a 2014 speech, he celebrated \u201cthe long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam\u201d and \u201cour forefathers\u201d who \u201cbequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West.\u201d\n\nDuring the Cold War, when the contest between Soviet and American power divided Europe along geographic lines, American presidents sometimes contrasted the democratic \u201cWest\u201d with the communist \u201cEast.\u201d But when the Cold War ended, they largely stopped associating America with \u201cthe West.\u201d Every president from George H.W. Bush to Barack Obama emphasized the portability of America\u2019s political and economic principles. The whole point was that democracy and capitalism were not uniquely \u201cWestern.\u201d They were not the property of any particular religion or race but the universal aspiration of humankind.\n\nTo grasp how different that rhetoric was from Trump\u2019s, look at how the last Republican President, George W. Bush, spoke when he visited Poland. In his first presidential visit, in 2001, Bush never referred to \u201cthe West.\u201d He did tell Poles that \u201cWe share a civilization.\u201d But in the next sentence he insisted that \u201cIts values are universal.\u201d Because they are, he declared, \u201cour trans-Atlantic community must have priorities beyond the consolidation of European peace. We must bring peace and health to Africa. \u2026 We must work toward a world that trades in freedom \u2026 a world of cooperation to enhance prosperity, protect the environment, and lift the quality of life for all.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Bush returned, and in his main speech didn\u2019t use the terms \u201cWest\u201d or \u201ccivilization\u201d at all. After celebrating Poland\u2019s achievements, he said America and Europe \u201cmust help men and women around the world to build lives of purpose and dignity\u201d so they don\u2019t turn to terrorism. He boasted that America was increasing its funding to fight global poverty and AIDS because \u201cwe add to our security by helping to spread freedom and alleviate suffering.\u201d And he said \u201cAmerica and Europe must work closely to develop and apply new technologies that will improve our air and water quality, and protect the health of the world\u2019s people.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s vision echoed Francis Fukuyama\u2019s. America and Europe may have been further along the road to prosperity, liberty, capitalism, and peace than other parts of the world, but all countries could follow their path. And the more each did, the more America and Europe would benefit. In deeply Catholic Poland, Bush sprinkled his speeches with religious references, but they were about Christianity as a universal creed, a moral imperative that knew no civilizational bounds. By contrast, when Trump warned Poles about forces \u201cfrom the south or the east, that threaten \u2026 to erase the bonds of culture, faith, and tradition,\u201d he was talking not about Christianity but about Christendom: a particular religious civilization that must protect itself from outsiders.", "description": "When the president says being Western is the essence of America\u2019s identity, he\u2019s in part defining America in opposition to some of its own people.", "authors": ["Peter Beinart"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/07/RTX3AAJ7-1/facebook.jpg?1522774853", "published_at": "2017-07-06"}
