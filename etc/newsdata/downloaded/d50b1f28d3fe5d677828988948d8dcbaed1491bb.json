Here's the truth about our planet", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is absolutely terrified of climate change \u2014 I mean really, terrified. In fact, according to the freshman congresswoman, she\u2019s so scared of climate change that it\u2019s waking her up \u201cin the middle of the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven while I was on vacation, I woke up in the middle of the night, at 3:30 in the morning, just concerned about climate change,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram livestream recently.\n\nOcasio-Cortez even wondered if, in a world with a changing climate, she should have children. \u201cI\u2019m 29 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cI really struggle sometimes with the idea of how to be a policymaker and potentially have a family in the time of climate change. And it really, like, freaks me out and it can be really, really scary.\u201d\n\nDANIEL TURNER: LABOR DAY BETRAYAL \u2013 OCASIO-CORTEZ LEADS DEM CANDIDATES TO EMBRACE ANTI-LABOR POLICIES\n\nWow, that\u2019s depressing. I almost feel bad for her.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s post came just one day after she lamented that there could be an untold number of ancient diseases hidden within glaciers, and that if those glaciers melt because of climate change, well, humanity could be in huge trouble.\n\n\u201cScientists fear that there\u2019s a potential that a lot of diseases could escape these melted glaciers, things that were frozen for thousands of years, and that they\u2019re going to get into our water,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cand that humans could contract them, and they are going to be diseases that are thousands of years old that have vectors that we are not prepared for, that we have never seen.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOn other occasions, Ocasio-Cortez has warned that climate change will cause the dangerous sea-level rise and lead to deadly increases in mosquito populations, along with dozens of other horror stories.\n\nI suppose if I believed that climate change will cause oceans to swallow up whole cities and release killer diseases that could wreak havoc on the human race, I, too, might think twice about bringing more humans into the world. But unlike Ocasio-Cortez, I have absolutely no trouble sleeping at night, and when I do, it sure as heck isn\u2019t because of climate change.\n\nDoes the evidence show Earth has warmed over the past century? Yes, of course. Is warming likely to continue for the next several decades, at least? Yes, probably.\n\nThe hard data overwhelmingly shows that recent warming has not been catastrophic and that humans are better off in our moderately warmer world.\n\nBut the available evidence shows that warming is not dangerous and not likely to be catastrophic, despite numerous dire reports from climate alarmists like Ocasio-Cortez and biased government agencies, which are often more interested in accomplishing political goals than engaging in real scientific inquiry.\n\nFor example, the evidence clearly shows that sea-level rise is not accelerating at a dangerous pace and that it\u2019s in line with sea-level rise measured prior to the widespread use of fossil fuels.\n\nAnd I know this will come as a shock to Ocasio-Cortez and her climate alarmist acolytes, but the hard data overwhelmingly shows that recent warming has not been catastrophic and that humans are better off in our moderately warmer world that they would otherwise be, because lower global temperatures are associated with more significant societal problems, like famine and weather-related deaths.\n\nAs James Taylor, my colleague and a senior fellow in environment and climate issues for The Heartland Institute, noted in a recent policy study, \u201cDuring the past 150 years, as Earth has emerged from the Little Ice Age, the warming climate has brought immeasurable benefits that continue today, including crop yields that have set records in the United States and globally nearly every year.\n\nHigher temperatures have also spurred a significant increase in global plant life, as measured by NASA satellites. Recent warming has led to a reduction in persistently lower temperatures, which researchers estimate kill 20 times more people than higher temperatures, and objective data show extreme weather and climate events have actually become slightly less frequent and severe in recent decades, despite numerous false or misleading media reports to the contrary.\u201d\n\nTaylor isn\u2019t alone. Numerous scientists have made similar observations in recent decades, a reality the mainstream press continues to ignore. For example, noted meteorologist Joe Bastardi, who now serves as the chief meteorologist at weatherbell.com, has found that \u201cin the fossil fuel era, in spite of a four-fold increase in population,\u201d the number of deaths related to climate has \u201cplummeted.\u201d\n\nPatrick Michaels, Ph.D., a former senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute, noted in 2018, \u201cwe don\u2019t live in the best of all possible climates,\u201d adding, \u201cSo what\u2019s happened as it\u2019s warmed this half a degree in the late 20th century and the CO2 has gone up and up in the atmosphere, well, what we've done is we've created a greener and greener planet and the greening of the Planet Earth is profound.\u201d\n\nAlarmists like Ocasio-Cortez also ignore the many important economic benefits provided by affordable, reliable energy sources like oil and natural gas. Unlike more expensive wind and solar, conventional energies work regardless if the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. Many conventional energy power facilities, especially nuclear, often last significantly longer than solar or wind facilities. And conventional energy sources require a lot less land.\n\nIf Ocasio-Cortez had it her way and the country was forced to abandon oil, natural gas, and coal \u2014 one of the most important provisions in her \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d plan \u2014 more than 100 million acres of land would need to be consumed by solar facilities and wind turbines. That\u2019s a landmass larger than the state of California. How many hundreds of millions of animals and countless animal habitats would need to be wiped out in the name of \u201csaving the planet\u201d?\n\nAnd where does Ocasio-Cortez think all of the required rare earth minerals needed to build and operate those windmills and solar panels would come from? Someone is going to have to dig them out of the earth, destroying even more land. And in some cases, the only place to find these materials is in countries with notorious and abysmal human rights records, like the Congo, which has frequently experienced intense violence dnd even permits child labor.\n\nMillions of dead animals, more than 100 million acres of destroyed land, significantly higher energy costs, and child labor \u2014 now, that sounds like a nightmare worth keeping you up at night.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWill global warming cause some problems, yes, but probably not nearly as many as proposals like the Green New Deal. And whatever problems do come humans\u2019 way will likely be outweighed by the benefits of warming and could easily be dealt with through technological innovations, human ingenuity, and, if necessary, behavioral changes.\n\nSo, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, feel free to have as many kids as you\u2019d like and sleep well. Humans are going to be just fine!\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JUSTIN HASKINS", "description": "The hard data overwhelmingly shows that recent warming has not been catastrophic and that humans are better off in our moderately warmer world.", "authors": ["Justin Haskins"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/29/694940094001_6079358738001_6079366521001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
