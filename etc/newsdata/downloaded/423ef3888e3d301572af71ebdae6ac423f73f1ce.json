Other Battle Royale Fortnite, which has been incredibly popular on PC, garnered 22.5 million downloads in its first week. PUBG Mobile, which was available on both iOS and Android at launch, only got 28 million downloads in its first week, and it's been all Indian teens have been playing for a while.\n\nDon't Miss 268 SHARES 265 SHARES\n\nApparently most of the downloads for CoDM were on iOS, 56.9 million of them to be exact, with 45.3 million from Android. The game has seen the most popularity in the US, with 17.3 million of 16.9 percent of the total. India followed second with 13.7 million downloads, with Brazil in third with 7.1 million.\n\nThe game, developed by Activision and Tencent, also earned $17.4 million in revenue this first week, dwarfing the $2.3 million and $600,000 Fortnite and PUBG Mobile earned in their first weeks respectively.\n\nHonestly, it is a really good game that ticks all the right boxes. It's easy enough to pick up and play, thanks to the autofire mode, while manual mode and extended lists of weapons, power-ups, and skill streaks lend to high-level mastery. It's free-to-play, which is great for markets like India, and is multiplayer, which tend to generate more usage than single-player games.\n\nYou should give it a try yourself, just don't forget to moderate how much time you spend with the app.", "description": "Call of Duty Mobile launched on iOS and Android last week, after a couple of months on beta testing.
