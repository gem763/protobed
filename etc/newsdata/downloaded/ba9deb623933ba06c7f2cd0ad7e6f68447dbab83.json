Drama first cropped up when fans who purchased the palette claimed it was poorer quality than what de Jager\u2019s own swatches and reveal suggested.\n\nThen, in 2017, as Star embarked on a public feud with Too Faced CEO Jeremy Johnson. Johnson suggested that other brands were ripping off a \u201cunicorn makeup\u201d trend he started, and Star responded to say that the \u201cunicorn\u201d trend started before Too Faced capitalized on it. Star also revealed that Johnson had underpaid de Jager.\n\nAt the time, speculation ran wild from anonymous sources that said de Jager only made between $40,000 and $60,000 on the product, which had sold at least 150,000 units \u2013 netting over $8 million.\n\nStar revived the old drama in his latest video with Shane Dawson, causing de Jager to respond again to his accusations on Twitter\n\ncaption Nikkie de Jager (L) teaches a Masterclass at SEPHORiA: House of Beauty \u2013 Day One at The Shrine Auditorium on September 07, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. source Photo by Presley Ann/Getty Images for Sephora\n\nIn \u201cThe Secrets of the Beauty World,\u201d Star tells Dawson that a fair split of earnings from their makeup collaboration would be giving Dawson 30 percent, due to the size of his audience and how it would impact sales. Star predicts that Dawson could make $5 million from the collaboration.\n\nHe goes on to explain that other makeup brands have been less than fair with YouTubers who create and market makeup collaborations. Star\u2019s example is Nikkie Tutorials, who he says made a $50,000 flat fee from her Too Faced palette and bundled products, called the \u201cThe Too Faced Power of Makeup by Nikkie Tutorials Collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen YouTubers and other influencers take dirt because they didn\u2019t know,\u201d Star said, noting that everything he revealed in Dawson\u2019s video was already on the record \u2013 when the controversy first emerged, anonymous sources confirmed to drama YouTuber Sanders Kennedy that de Jager only made between $40,000 and $60,000.\n\n\u201cWhen she told me, I was so horrified,\u201d Star continued on to say in the video. \u201cAnd when I kind of let that secret out it turned really ugly.\u201d\n\nRead more: Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star have yet to prove that their 9-part \u2018documentary\u2019 is more than just an advertisement\n\nDawson\u2019s video already has almost 12 million views and is the top trending video on the platform. De Jager responded to the rehashing of her Too Faced collaboration on Twitter on Saturday, calling herself \u201cnaive\u201d for signing the contract \u2013 and suggesting that the real drama at play involved Too Faced changing the quality of the product without her knowledge.\n\n\u201cI signed my contract with TF back then because I was naive & didn\u2019t know better,\u201d de Jager wrote on Twitter. \u201cAt the end of the day, I signed it, it\u2019s my own fault \u2013 but what I\u2019ll never forgive is that \u2018allegedly\u2019 they changed the palette\u2019s quality behind my back. 1000\u2019s of negative reviews & I was clueless.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say, \u201cI had to see all these negative reviews, while the palettes I had were outstanding. \u2018they lying in their videos to get views\u2019 is what I was told. I don\u2019t care about the money.. but I had to fight YEARS to prove my authenticity and gain your trust again.\u201d\n\nNeither Too Faced, its parent company Est\u00e9e Lauder, or de Jager immediately responded to Insider\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "Business Insider - Nikkie Tutorials responds to a new Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star documentary that says she only made $50k from her Too Faced palette collaboration..
