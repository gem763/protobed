Counter to conventional wisdom, this impeachment does not expose a corrupt president. Instead, it reveals the rot at the core of an establishment willing to abuse the system to overturn an election.\n\nErgo, impeachment was inevitable if we were correct in our support for Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nIf the system was as corrupt and malevolent as we had intuited through the decline of the country under Democratic rule, then of course their reaction would be to implement corrupt and malevolent mechanisms to reverse Trump\u2019s election.\n\nThe phony Russian dossier, the actions of federal law-enforcement agencies to implement the attempted framing of a president, and the double-dipping in that toxic stew now known as the \u201cUkraine scandal\u201d are efforts that were meant to lead to impeachment.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s election was more than a poke in the eye at the ruling, patronizing and malevolent establishment; it was a declaration of war against embedded politicians who think being in power is their birthright.\n\nThe shock and rejection by the establishment of the 2016 election were clear from the start. A Washington Post headline on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated, read: \u201cThe Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.\u201d\n\nThe conspirators in this debacle may tell themselves that it\u2019s all OK because they\u2019re using the system with which to try to overturn your election. But that\u2019s like telling people because bull dung is on the buffet table that makes it automatically a legitimate entree.\n\nThe abusive behavior, various tantrums and lawsuits, leaks and threats, and the deliberate attempt to overturn the 2016 election by impeachment have all been proof of the vital importance of Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\n\nAs the Democrats stumble through this outrageous abuse of our system, they are also confessing that they know they cannot win the White House in 2020.\n\n\u201cI have absolute certainty because we\u2019re going to make sure it happens that we will retain the majority in the House of Representatives. What\u2019s more serious is that he [President Trump] can\u2019t win, that is very serious \u2026,\u201d Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi told an audience while at an event hosted by The Atlantic.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as though she\u2019s hinting at an insurance policy to keep Mr. Trump\u2019s reelection from happening.\n\nThen there\u2019s Rep. Al Green, Texas Democrat, who was even more direct about the reason behind the push for impeachment: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if we don\u2019t impeach this president, he will get re-elected \u2026 the president does not have to commit a crime to be impeached \u2026,\u201d he told MSNBC.\n\nWhatever the \u201cinsurance policy\u201d was that disgraced former FBI agent Peter Strzok crowed about to his paramour Lisa Page, we know it involved not having Mr. Trump as president.\n\nThe impeachment of Mr. Trump was inevitable because we were right about a system that had deliberately forgotten the men and women of this country and believe that they are the only ones that matter. This was the fight in 2016, albeit we knew the reaction to Mr. Trump would be the ultimate confirmation about the malevolence of our own government toward us.\n\nImpeachment has always been the go-to effort, because it was the only way they could dress up the coup that became their chosen recourse. Removing Mr. Trump from office in an election year is amazingly brazen as they admit through this process that they want to remove him as a choice for voters.\n\nThis from a group of people who clearly believe they cannot win using the process the Founders established. Impeaching Mr. Trump, getting rid of the Electoral College, and even so-called \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and the Green New Deal, are all about giving complete and total power to a small group of people who, in their delusion, believe that only they have the answers. They promote mindless policy prescriptions requiring you handing your entire life and all of your money over to these masters of the universe.\n\nWhy? Because you\u2019re too dumb to know you can\u2019t be trusted.\n\nFor anyone who is still on the fence about whether or not the impeachment charade reveals the rot in the Democratic Party and establishment in general, ask yourself, why are they conducting this process in secret? Interviews and hearings in private, secret accusers, no floor vote, and announcements by media and Democrats that they already have the votes for impeachment.\n\nSo really, why go through the charade of hearings in the first place? Because even they know that what they\u2019re doing is a fraud, otherwise, why pretend? And yet, they can\u2019t help themselves because this is what they\u2019ve been doing for decades.\n\nWhile all of this is disturbing, the fact is, it\u2019s not new. We are simply now watching the system with the curtains pulled back, courtesy of our vote and Mr. Trump. Once again, the Trump election is exposing the inherent corruption at the foundation of our precious government. He is bearing the brunt of their rage, and we must stay focused so their corruption, and its concomitant soft coup, does not prevail.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce, president of Independent Women\u2019s Voice, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk-show host.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
