He has no idea what he has gotten himself in for and what the dressing room is like. He will have his work cut out from the start.\u201d\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, leaders Atletico Madrid visit Real Sociedad in the first game at the revamped Anoeta stadium looking to make it four wins out of four.\n\nReal Madrid host Levante missing a total of nine players, with Luka Modric the latest to suffer an injury.", "description": "With Lionel Messi still injured, faltering La Liga champions Barcelona host Valencia on Saturday needing to prove they can produce big performances without their talisman.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429047496&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0VT", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
