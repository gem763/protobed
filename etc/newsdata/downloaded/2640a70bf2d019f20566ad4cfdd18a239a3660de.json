The skill will deliver a different story every weekday, drawn from among The Atlantic\u2019s most memorable and compelling recent reporting.\n\nEvery weekday, when people queue their smart speakers with the commands \u201cAlexa, open The Atlantic\u2019s Daily Idea\u201d or \u201cGoogle, play news from The Atlantic,\u201d they\u2019ll hear a condensed, one-to two-minute read of an Atlantic story, be it \u201cAn Artificial Intelligence Developed Its Own Non-Human Language\u201d or \u201cThe Case for Locking Up Your Smartphone.\u201d The skill will include reporting from across The Atlantic\u2019s science, tech, health, family, and education sections, as well as the magazine\u2019s archives, representing the work of dozens of writers.\n\nFor more info, add The Atlantic to your smart speaker\u2019s news briefing or visit TheAtlantic.com/dailyidea.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Daily Idea joins The Atlantic\u2019s growing audio platform, which includes the weekly news and politics podcast Radio Atlantic and the series Crazy/Genius, currently in its third season with host Derek Thompson. The Atlantic is also in production on its first long-form narrative podcast, which will examine Hurricane Katrina and be reported and hosted by staff writer Vann R. Newkirk II. The podcast will be a limited-run series and will launch in the fall.\n\nCapgemini, a global consulting, technology-services, and digital-transformation company with 40 offices across North America, is the exclusive sponsor of The Atlantic\u2019s Daily Idea. The company\u2019s commitment to the field of AI makes it a natural fit for the smart-speaker initiative.", "description": "New smart-speaker skill delivers daily, illuminating ideas for Amazon Echo and Google Home", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/06/at_daily_idea_1/facebook.png?1560795394"}
