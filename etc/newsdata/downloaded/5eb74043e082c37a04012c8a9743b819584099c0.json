Moreover, the bottom line improved 33% year over year, mainly on lower fuel costs.\n\n\n\nThe earnings beat coupled with the carrier\u2019s raised earnings outlook for 2019 led to a gain of 1.4% in the company\u2019s shares during after-hours trading on Oct 15.\n\n\n\nThe carrier now anticipates 2019 adjusted earnings between $11.25 and $12.25 compared with $10.5-$12 expected previously. The mid-point of the guided range \u2014 $11.75 \u2014 slightly falls short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.81. It is to be noted that, the company had lifted its full-year earnings view during second-quarter earnings release as well.\n\n\n\nThe successive guidance boost despite numerous flight cancellations due to the MAX grounding issues reflects the carrier\u2019s ability to overcome such setbacks, courtesy of strong travel demand and modest fuel prices. Additionally, the company hopes to achieve or even surpass its 2020 earnings projection of $11-$13 per share.\n\n\n\nComing back to the airline\u2019s earnings results, although operating revenues of $11,380 million increased 3.4% year over year, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11428.2 million. Higher passenger revenues drove the top line.\n\n\n\nPassenger revenues, accounting for bulk (92.1%) of the top line, rose 3.6% year over year. However, cargo revenues representing 2.5% of the top line declined 4.7%. Revenues from other sources contributed to the remainder.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise More\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | United Airlines Holdings Inc Quote\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Results\n\n\n\nConsolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) inched up 1.7% year over year to 13.96 cents.
