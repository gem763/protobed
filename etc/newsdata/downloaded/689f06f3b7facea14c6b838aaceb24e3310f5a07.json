You know, the one where authors Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly claimed that Kavanaugh drunkenly flashed his private parts at a class-mate during his time at Yale? It had many Democrats, including some running of the presidency, calling for his impeachment. It then quieted down. Why? The authors later clarified that actually, the \"victim\" in the story did not even remember it happening. Anyways, the book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh, received virtually wall-to-wall coverage from the mainstream media. One would think given all that publicity that the book would land on several best-seller lists and sell tens of thousands in its first week. Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nAccording to numbers given to Townhall, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh sold roughly 2500 books. How bad is that? Well, the authors are reporters for the New York Times and it did not even make the NYT Bestsellers List.\n\nContrast that with another book about Kavanaugh which recently came out, Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. That book received virtually zero press coverage from the mainstream media. Aside from Fox News, the book spread largely via word of mouth, new media, and Twitter.\n\nHow did it do sales wise? Justice on Trial dominated, landing on several best seller's list including the NYT's. It sold more than 17,000 copies in its first week alone.\n\nThe Federalist recently broke down its success:\n\nWhen \u201cJustice On Trial\u201d debuted this July, it was Amazon\u2019s top-selling book overall, non-fiction or otherwise, from Monday through Friday. It also ranked No. 1 on Publisher\u2019s Weekly, which is based on actual point-of-sale data, and No. 6 on the New York Times best-seller list, which is not based on sales figures. A spokesperson for the publisher of \u201cJustice On Trial,\u201d Regnery Publishing, said these types of inaccurate reports and books are exactly why they wanted to make sure a definitive account of what really happened during the Kavanaugh confirmation was put on the record. \u201cIn Justice on Trial, Mollie and Carrie have clearly exposed the left\u2019s playbook when it comes to Supreme Court nominations, and the sales activity we\u2019re seeing of the NYT book in its first week compared to Justice on Trial\u2019s in its 11th week is evidence that the American people see right through the corporate media\u2019s agenda and are standing by Justice Kavanaugh,\u201d they said.\n\nThe absolute failure of The Education of Brett Kavanaugh all the while being propped up by leftists in the news business just goes to show how out of touch progressives and the mainstream media are with the rest of the country. But hey, at least the authors got a nice photo from their time on ABC's \"The View.\"", "description": ".09/26/2019 19:44:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/269/f2591c7c-4df3-4dc0-b0fb-7cd2e68afb32.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
