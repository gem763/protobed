The fact is, I didn't understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day,\" he said.\n\nThe Liberal Party leader and son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau also blamed his \"place of privilege\" for his actions.\n\n\"I've always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege but now I need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blindspot,\" he said.\n\nDuring his apology, he said he has since known dressing up in blackface was \"always unacceptable.\"\n\nDAVE RUBIN: TRUDEAU SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, CONSISTENT WITH LEFT'S RULES\n\n\"I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it,\" he said.\n\nThe election campaign was rocked when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau Wednesday, with his face blackened at an \"Arabian Nights\" party from 2001 when he was a 29-year-old teacher at a school in Vancouver. Two more images subsequently emerged, including a picture of him wearing an afro wig and singing the Jamaican son \"Day-O\" during a talent show in the early 1990s at Jean Brebeuf High School.\n\nWhen asked in the Oval Office on Friday, President Trump told reporters he was \"surprised\" by the photos.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t be asked that question... I'm surprised,\" Trump said. \"I was more surprised when I saw the number of times. And I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with Justin. I just don\u2019t know what to tell you. I was surprised by it, actually.\"\n\nFox News' Barnini Chakraborty contributed to this article.", "description": "Justin Trudeau on Friday pledged to ban military-style assault rifles, including the AR-15, in Canada as he attempted to get his re-election campaign back on track following a damaging blackface scandal.", "authors": ["Chris Irvine", "Chris Irvine Is Senior News Editor At Fox News.
