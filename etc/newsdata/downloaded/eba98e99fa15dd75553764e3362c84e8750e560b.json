Unconventional oil and gas reserves, which previously were deemed as \u2018uneconomic to produce\u2019, are being exploited on a massive scale.\n\nConsequentially, the shale revolution has altered the international energy landscape, which has enabled cooperation between rivals Russia and Saudi Arabia within the OPEC+ framework. Furthermore, the flooding of the market with cheap natural gas is strengthening the fuel\u2019s competitive position and replacing coal in the power generation market.\n\nAlso, innovations in renewable energy technologies are advancing at a rapid pace. Although wind and solar power have been around for some time, it wasn\u2019t until prices dropped significantly during the past decade that installations skyrocketed across the world.\n\nThe share of renewables in the U.S. in the overall power production differs from state to state. While gas has become the primary source of electricity production, technological advancements are about to make fossil fuels more expensive and therefore uneconomic compared to renewables. The tipping point could come much sooner than certain utilities and investors are expecting, which could hit current investment plans for gas-fired power plants.\n\nInnovations and cost reductions\n\nIn the 19th century, the growing consumption of coal was made possible by relative abundance and low production costs in the heartland of the industrial revolution. After the UK\u2019s ancient forests were destroyed by the expanding human population, coal was the most straightforward alternative to power the steam engine and other innovations.\n\nKing Coal\u2019s replacement, however, is largely made possible by technological improvements in drilling techniques with cheap energy as a consequence. While twenty years ago only twenty percent of the U.S.\u2019 power production was met by natural gas, currently it stands at thirty-five percent while the overall energy consumption has also increased.\n\nRelated: Home Energy Storage Capacity Breaks Records In US\n\nTechnical improvements and costs reductions are having a similar effect on the substitution of natural gas by renewables as the primary source of power production. Cheaper batteries and innovative new ideas regarding the flexibility of the grid are accelerating the transformation towards an environmentally friendly energy industry. Therefore, according to a report from the Rocky Mountain Institute investments in gas-fired power plants could devalue significantly by the year 2035 as power production by alternative means becomes more relevant.\n\nSound investments based on long-term predictions\n\nThe transformation of the U.S.\u2019 power sector is coming much sooner than incumbent producers were expecting. Currently, the combination of solar, wind, storage, and demand response are already more efficient, and therefore cheaper, than the use of fossil fuels.\n\nSource: Rocky Mountain Institute\n\nThis should have a profound impact on investments plans. However, there is an estimated $90 billion reserved for new gas-fired power plants in the coming years until 2035. According to the report from the Rocky Mountain Institute, U.S. consumer could save $29 billion if renewables and additional technologies such as storage and demand response replace the proposed gas plants.\n\nRelated: Where Is The World's Safest Source Of Oil?\n\nThe changing economics of power production will also affect subsidiary businesses such as the pipeline sector where $30 billion in pipelines are planned. It would impact 95 percent of gas pipelines in use by 2035 due to reduced utilization by 20 to 60 percent. This would effectively create a \u201cfinancial death spiral\u201d meaning a vicious circle where fewer customers will lead to less income, leading to higher prices, and so forth.\n\nAccording to Mark Dyson, an analyst at the Rocky Mountain Institute, \u201cour story for gas plants is, if you build it, they won\u2019t run. They won\u2019t run at their expected capacity factors. And that filters down to pipelines, too.\u201d", "description": "Natural gas fired power plants are one of the main reasons for the steep decline of coal, but rapidly falling costs of solar and wind power could soon undercut investments in gas-fired capacity", "authors": ["Vanand Meliksetian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bm8LnuEvyyXJWom10g_2JQ--~B/aD05NDI7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/oilprice.com/523e1ea64a22e479b5f63e4b898ac42e", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
