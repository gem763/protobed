Watt suffered a shoulder injury in the second quarter of Sunday\u2019s game against the Oakland Raiders and didn\u2019t return to the contest.\n\nWatt left the field and entered the Texans\u2019 blue medical tent halfway through the second frame before retreating to the locker room. Houston initially announced the defensive lineman was questionable to return before later ruling him out at the beginning of the third quarter.\n\nBefore leaving the game, Watt recorded three tackles, a tackle for a loss and a pass breakup. He has four sacks this season.\n\nLeague sources told NFL Media that Watt\u2019s injury could potentially cost him the remainder of this season. Watt is believed to have suffered a torn pectoral muscle, which would end his 2019-20 campaign.\n\nAfter the game, Texans head coach Bill O\u2019Brien told reporters Watt was sent to the hospital to get an MRI.\n\nTexans cornerback Lonnie Johnson was also knocked out of Sunday\u2019s matchup with a concussion. Houston was already without starting cornerbacks Johnathan Joseph and Bradley Roby entering its Week 8 contest.\n\nThe Texans beat the Raiders 27-24 to improve their record to 5-3 this season.", "description": "Oct. 27 (UPI) \u2014 Houston Texans star defensive end J.J.
