(Reuters) - The simmering rivalry between progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, presidential contenders with similar policies but sharply different styles, is headed for a showdown in New Hampshire.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks at a campaign rally in Dover, New Hampshire, U.S. September 1, 2019. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nThe state\u2019s Feb. 11 Democratic primary election is likely to decide which of the two neighboring U.S. senators, Sanders from Vermont or Warren from Massachusetts, emerges as the top liberal challenger to establishment front-runner Joe Biden in the 2020 race to pick a nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nThe two progressives, who campaigned in New Hampshire over the Labor Day holiday weekend and will return again later this week, are increasing their staffing and visits in the New England state that holds the second nominating contest in the Democratic race.\n\nRecent opinion polls show Sanders running second and the steadily rising Warren third behind Biden in New Hampshire, where they are known quantities to the state\u2019s big bloc of liberal voters. Exit polls in 2016 found 68% of those who cast a ballot in the Democratic primary considered themselves very or somewhat liberal.\n\nThat makes New Hampshire, a traditional proving ground that can make or break presidential contenders, ground zero for the inevitable Sanders vs. Warren conflict.\n\n\u201cIt will be a real challenge moving forward for the one who doesn\u2019t win, or finishes behind the other. It will have a damaging effect,\u201d said Jim Demers, co-chairman of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 New Hampshire campaign, who has endorsed U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey in the race.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders won 60% of the primary vote in beating Hillary Clinton in the state during an unsuccessful run for the White House.\n\nGiven his strong performance, Sanders faces more pressure and bigger expectations than Warren this time around, said Kathy Sullivan, a former chairwoman of the state party who has not backed a candidate.\n\n\u201cBernie needs to win here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s over if he doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s going to be much harder for him.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates share similarities in ideology and have promised not to criticize each other, but they showed plenty of stylistic differences during their weekend visits to New Hampshire.\n\nAt a town hall meeting and a rally on Sunday, Sanders soberly reminded crowds he was attacked during the 2016 campaign for his \u201cradical\u201d ideas such as Medicare for All, free public college tuition and a higher federal minimum wage, all issues that have now moved into the Democratic mainstream.\n\n\u201cThese are no longer radical ideas,\u201d said Sanders, whose speeches were almost devoid of personal references.\n\nAt an outdoor house party in Hampton Falls on Monday, Warren laced her talk with personal details and jokes, drawing a link between the financial uncertainty of her childhood in Oklahoma and the impact it had on her populist economic policies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m in this fight,\u201d she said, before taking selfies with members of the crowd in a driving rain.\n\n\u2018BERNIE BEATS TRUMP\u2019\n\nBoth Sanders, 77, and Warren, 70, addressed one of the biggest voter concerns about their candidacies: their ability to win over enough moderate and independent voters to beat Trump in November 2020 and recapture the White House.\n\nSanders repeatedly touted polls showing him beating Trump in a head-to-head matchup. Ben Cohen, a Sanders supporter and co-founder of the Vermont ice cream company Ben & Jerry\u2019s, led the crowd in a chant of \u201cBernie Beats Trump!\u201d\n\nWarren was asked in Hampton Falls about concerns over her electability.\n\n\u201cI think what is going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have got to give people a reason to show up and vote, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nThere are differences in the two senators\u2019 appeal. Some polls show Sanders doing better among young people, lower-income earners and people without a college degree. Those without a degree were 40% of the Democratic electorate in the state in 2016.\n\nDean Merchant, a writer from Stratham, said he backed Sanders in 2016 but thought it was time for a woman in the White House. He is considering Warren, as well as U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California.\n\n\u201cI like Bernie, but he\u2019s like Biden - he\u2019s older now,\u201d Merchant said. \u201cAt this stage I would like to see someone more vibrant, strong and forceful.\u201d\n\nKevin Daley, an acupuncturist in Raymond, said he was backing Sanders but would be happy with Warren.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a brilliant person and she has been a good progressive. I just hope they don\u2019t end up splitting the vote and we end up with Biden - that\u2019s the danger,\u201d said Daley.\n\nJeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Sanders, said the campaign has about 50 paid staff in the state and will hire more. New Hampshire is an important step toward the nomination, he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think there is any one state that will make or break this campaign.\u201d\n\nThe Warren campaign has five field offices in New Hampshire, with a sixth opening this week. It did not provide a number of paid staff in the state. Biden has 45 paid staff here, said Terry Shumaker, a Biden supporter who co-chaired Bill Clinton\u2019s state campaigns.\n\nSanders and Warren will both be back this weekend at the state Democratic convention. Warren has been in the state on 17 days since January, and Sanders on 12, according to a candidate tracker at the NBC10 television station in Boston.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks at a campaign house party in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, U.S., September 2, 2019.

Why choose now?\u201d", "description": "The simmering rivalry between progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, presidential contenders with similar policies but sharply different styles, is headed for a showdown in New Hampshire.", "authors": ["John Whitesides", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425827200&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821KO"}
