It might be a record wind event, the National Weather Service warned.\n\nPictured: Utility company PG&E announced they may cut power for several counties in four separate regions because of an 'historic wind event set to hit California this weekend\n\nThe power cuts could affect 850,00 household, equally to around 2.5 million homes, in California as they attempt to prepare for 70mph winds\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said it would begin blackouts in the afternoon for about 940,000 homes and businesses in 36 counties for 48 hours or longer throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, wine country and Sierra foothills. That's about 90,000 more customers affected than previously predicted. It previously said it was considering cutting power to 850,000 homes, which would affect around 2.5 million people.\n\nPG&E Corporation CEO and President Bill Johnson tried to reassure customers that the company was taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of Californians.\n\n'We understand that a longer shutoff would be very difficult for our customers. We are already working to minimize the length, including amassing a force of field personnel from PG&E, plus contractors and other utility companies, to be ready to tackle the inspection, repair and restoration process as soon as the weather passes,' he said in a statement.\n\nPG&E cites the 'historic wind event' set to hit the state this weekend as the main reason for the additional power cuts.\n\nA fire burns in Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California, Mexico.

What's making this event really substantial and historic is the amount of time that these winds are going to remain.'\n\nWinds are expected to reach up to 70mph in the mountains and the high winds could potentially cause an electrical system to spark, causing a fire to set ablaze in dry bush.\n\n'The upcoming wind event has the potential to be one of the strongest in the last several years. It's also likely to be longer than recent wind events, which have lasted about 12 hours or less,' PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel.\n\nAccording to an announcement from the utility company, 12 counties in the Northern Sierra foothills could lose power by as early as 3pm Saturday and five counties in the North Bay area could be without power by 5pm Saturday.\n\nA staggering 15 counties could without power around 7pm on Saturday in the Bay Area, Central Coast and Sierra Foothills.\n\nFinally, Kern county could is potentially scheduled for 11am on Sunday.\n\nResidents are still waiting on an official announcement from PG&E.\n\nCalifornia firefighters battling blazes in Canyon County, north of Los Angeles, on Friday night\n\nMeanwhile, PG&E is catching heat for its potential role in the massive wildfires terrorizing California.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric says up to 2.1 million people in Northern and Central California could lose power in the largest planned power shutoff in the region.\n\nThe utility said it has notified about 850,000 customers in 36 counties that it may cut off power between 6pm and 10pm on Saturday to prevent wildfires.

Years and years of greed, years and years of mismanagement in the utilities, in particularly PG&E.\n\n'Greed has precipitated a lack of intentionality and focus and a hardening our grid, undergrounding their transmission lines.\n\n'They simply did not do their job.
