I'm a kind and compassionate person and it horrifies me to realise my husband was only after my cash,' Ms Lewis told the Sunday Mirror.\n\n'He mentioned how lucky I was to live in the UK. I brought him here, now I'm paying the price.'\n\nPet sitter Marilyn, who has two daughters, aged 34 and 32, and a 21-year-old son, thought Amr was 28 when they first met and says their first meetings were some of the 'best days of my life'.\n\nShe says that Amr initially paid for everything while she holidayed at the Red Sea and the next year in Sharm El Sheikh, but when asked for a phone she obligingly bought him one.\n\nBut after Amr moved to the UK with Ms Lewis, she says the amounts of money he would ask for became larger.\n\nWhile she did insist on a pre-nup for their marriage she never had it signed by a witness \u2013 so it became void when she would later need it.\n\nFeeling 'insecure' about having a much younger husband, she paid him the money to recapture 'good times' of her younger years, and would eventually lead to her mortgaging her Bexleyheath, South East London home.\n\nBut the relationship fell apart after Amr was brought to the UK and turned 'moody and money-grabbing' and went on cougar dating sites\n\nHer daughters moved out in protest as Amr arrived, at first on a six-month visa.\n\nBut his tone changed 'completely' in 2010, and he demanded a second-hand Mercedes and several large loans.\n\nMarilyn claims he was using a 'cougar' dating website to find other girlfriends, and that one woman in her 60s contacted her claiming to be owed \u00a36,000 by Amr, which she mistakenly dismissed out of hand as a jealous ex.\n\nShe divorced him in 2014 after agreeing to buy the Mercedes, but found he had taken out two \u00a33,000 loans on his own.\n\nBut last year she received the worst news \u2013 a \u00a3100,000 divorce claim.\n\nBy the time it reached court it was down to \u00a350,000, with a final ruling by the Medway County Court to pay \u00a340,000 to Amr who needs to 'establish himself' in the UK.\n\nStill hoping to appeal this ruling, Marilyn said she is 'staggered' that he is 'entitled to a penny'.\n\nAmr, now 33, said: 'This was a court order. They reviewed everything and I have been rewarded that sum.\n\n'I did not lie. I believe the courts here are very fair.'", "description": "Marilyn Lewis fell in love with\u00a0Egyptian man Amr Elasar, 22, while on holiday at the Red Sea, where the young travel guide wooed her with free camel rides.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/12/19359698-0-image-a-18_1570361305124.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
