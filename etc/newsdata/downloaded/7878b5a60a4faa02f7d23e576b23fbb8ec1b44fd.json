He further told the commission that Jiba and her personal assistant Jackie Lepinka had leaked confidential National Prosecuting Authority documents to Mti and AGO chief executive Gavin Watson.\n\nJiba and Lepinka have denied all the claims.\n\nREAD: Jiba 'eager' to testify at the state capture commission \u2013 lawyer\n\nOn Tuesday morning, commission chair Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said he was concerned that Agrizzi had said in his affidavit that he had no personal knowledge of payments made to Jiba.\n\nHe added that he did not see how, in this regard, Jiba's cross-examination could assist the commission.\n\nHowever, he said this may not apply to Jiba's second part of her application which deals with her intention to deal with her side of the story.\n\nALSO READ: Jiba 'extremely displeased' as Agrizzi ditches Mokgoro inquiry\n\nAfter deliberations between Jiba's legal team and Zondo, it was suggested that the application be placed on hold pending the testimony of other witnesses on the matter, as Agrizzi's allegations were just hearsay.\n\nHowever, the allegations will no longer be hearsay once Linda Mti is called to testify, said Zondo.\n\nDespite attorney Zola Majavu's apprehension that a delay could mean bad news for his client Jiba, he agreed to wait.\n\nMajavu added that Agrizzi's allegations had done harm to Jiba's integrity and that she had a right to set the record straight.\n\nAdvocate Julie Harwood, acting on behalf of Agrizzi, said they did not oppose the delay and reiterated that Jiba's intention to cross-examine hearsay could waste the commission's time.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
