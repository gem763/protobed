Instead, their main focus is on keeping the nation's large debt pile under control, Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China, said.\n\nYao Wei, chief China economist at Societe Generale, told Bloomberg this was because China was playing the long game with its economic strategy.\n\n\"They measure the policy scope by looking at the overall debt, by looking at how much risk there is in shadow banking, in the housing sector and in inflation,\" Yao said. \"Looking at all these things, they judge they actually don't have much scope from a long-term perspective. So they're very careful about how to use it and when to use it.\"", "description": "\"We have trade tensions, we have other geopolitical forces, we have all these uncertainties around the world.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7962/f1c40f30fa794ad5aef86321bb50e150.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
