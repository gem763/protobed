And on page eight ... it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.\u201d\n\nWhat gets lost in all these debates is the pesky question of how a Democratic president could possibly enact even a fraction of the far-reaching plans that he or she is advocating. In the best possible case, a Democratic president would be inaugurated in 2021 with maybe a one-vote margin in the currently 53-47 Republican Senate.\n\nBoth Warren and Cory Booker talked about ending the filibuster in order to pass major gun legislation. And Sanders, who would keep the filibuster if elected, spoke about using the arcane congressional process of budget reconciliation to pass legislation with just a 51-vote majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the truth is\u2014as inconvenient as it may be for Democratic dreamers\u2014that a massive transformation of health care, let alone something akin to Warren\u2019s $2.75 trillion wealth tax, would require more than a flimsy one-vote majority to clear the Senate. In fact, the mere attempt to force something so transformational through Congress, particularly if the next president has only a narrow mandate to pass such sweeping reforms, could give Republicans a congressional sweep in 2022. That\u2019s the last thing that the Democrats, or the nation, need.\n\nLast night, voters witnessed a robust debate about the intricacies of policy arguments on topics like health care, as the Democratic Party splits between those who want to scrap Obamacare and those who want to expand it. But my hunch is that personal attributes and personal stories will matter far more to Democratic primary voters than the fine print in position papers.\n\nMany reporters, eager for fresh material, may have groaned inwardly when Stephanopoulos turned the final debate question into personal discussions of resilience in the lives of the candidates. But for voters, his chosen topic may have been the most relevant and compelling portion of the entire debate.\n\nBiden, who has suffered enough personal tragedies to compete with Job, spoke movingly about how he lost his \u201cfaith for a while\u201d after his wife and infant daughter died in a car crash soon after he was elected to the Senate. Pete Buttigieg told a prime-time TV audience about coming out as gay because he could not face \u201cnot knowing what it was like to be in love any longer.\u201d And Warren, lifting a fragment almost word-for-word from her stump speech, described losing a teaching post because she was pregnant: \u201cI\u2019m at home. I got a baby. I can\u2019t have a job. What am I going to do? Here\u2019s resilience. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll go to law school.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Houston debate offered the voters far more light than heat. But it probably helped Democratic voters clarify their choices. That alone was a public service no matter what happens in the post-debate polls.\n\n", "description": "They aren't meant to gin up scathing attacks and YouTube moments.
