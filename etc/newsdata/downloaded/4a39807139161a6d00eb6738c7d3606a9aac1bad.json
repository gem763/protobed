I know when Khloe sees this, it's gonna set her off again.\"\n\nThe pair first tied the knot in late 209, only a month after meeting.\n\nFour years later, Lamar was arrested on charges of driving under the influence, and later that year Khloe filed for divorce.\n\nEventually, she made the claim that Lamar had been unfaithful.\n\n\"Let me tell something,\" she said at the time, \"Last year, on my birthday, I lied to everyone, because I had to lie and sayI was with my husband, when in fact my husband was missing with another girl, OK?\"", "description": "Khloe spoke with ex-husband Lamar on Keeping Up With The Kardashians after she heard he was penning a book", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Kuwtk", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20740520.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_FILES-Lamar-Odom-and-Khloe-Kardashian-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
