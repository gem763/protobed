The assault also resulted in the escape of hundreds of Islamic State supporters from a detention camp.\n\nOn Friday, the Kurds on Friday accused Turkish forces of violating the U.S. agreement with Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government, which Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered following hours of deliberation with officials in Ankara.\n\nBut Trump appeared optimistic that the armed conflict in the Middle East \u2014 precipitated by his decision to allow the Turkish invasion and subsequent order to evacuate the last American troops in Syria \u2014 would soon come to a swift end.\n\n\u201cThere is good will on both sides & a really good chance for success,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe U.S. has secured the Oil, & the ISIS Fighters are double secured by Kurds & Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe president also offered an update on his call for France, Germany and other Western powers to take over custody of ISIS militants who originated from those countries.\n\n\u201cI have just been notified that some European Nations are now willing, for the first time, to take the ISIS Fighters that came from their nations,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThis is good news, but should have been done after WE captured them. Anyway, big progress being made!!!!\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/1b/80/163227c845de820bfc5eb7fdf97f/191018-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
