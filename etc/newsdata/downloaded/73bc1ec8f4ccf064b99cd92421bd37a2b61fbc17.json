Whether they just moved into a freshman dorm or just graduated, college students have one thing in common: They are new to adulthood and therefore lacking the well-designed stuff that makes adult life easier, cozier, and a lot more fun.\n\nTo help you find a gift they\u2019ll love, we talked to actual college students and recent grads about the most memorable gifts they\u2019ve ever received, the gear and gadgets they use every day, and the items topping their wish lists. Here are 23 of the best gifts for college freshmen, gifts for college graduates, and all the students in between.\n\nBest overall gift for college students\n\n\n\n\n\nApple AirPods $144 (was $159, now 9% off) Of the six students who recommended wireless headphones, four called out AirPods as the ones they have or the ones they want. Ashley Lee, a junior at Brown University, says wireless is \u201cuseful when working out or doing busy work and chores, because you don\u2019t have a cord connecting the headphones to your phone so you can move about more easily.\u201d Kira Sommer, a recent graduate of George Washington University who we spoke to for an article about dorm-room essentials, says, \u201cPlease, please, please invest in a good pair of headphones,\u201d explaining that students blasting music or video games in shared spaces can cause a big problem. But there\u2019s no need to invest too much. Carl Escoffier, a recent graduate of Leeds University and a new student at Goldsmiths, says \u201cno student wants or needs $500 Beats by Dre to truly enjoy music.\u201d What college students want \u201cis to be able to play music from their phone without any faff or cables,\u201d he says. \u201cAirPods solve that problem, without being ostentatious or overly pricey.\u201d When we spoke to Kim Tang, a second-year RA at The College of New Jersey, and Sarah Rebarber, a student at Columbia University, for our story on what to pack for college, they both told us that AirPods are the wireless headphones they see most at school. And Pia Mileaf-Patel, a recent Brown graduate, says she really wants a pair but would never buy them for herself, which is why she says \u201cthey make a great gift.\u201d $144 at Amazon Buy $144 at Walmart Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) gift for college students\n\nJBL Flip 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker Four of the students we consulted recommended this affordable and portable Bluetooth speaker. Maxx Grossman, a senior at Tufts University, calls it \u201cquality but portable.\u201d He says that having a portable speaker is nice because \u201cI often find myself wanting to play music for a party or while hanging out with friends.\u201d Both Mileaf-Patel and Escoffier agree that the Flip 4, which is also waterproof, making it able to withstand accidents and spills, would make a great gift. Christel Langu\u00e9, a graduate of Lehigh University, told us that she can\u2019t imagine life without a bluetooth speaker. \u201cThey come in handy all the time,\u201d she says. $80 at Amazon Buy $80 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beauty gift for college students\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the vendor Glossier The Skincare Set In just a few short years, Glossier\u2019s pink bubble packaging has become iconic. It\u2019s also become something of a status symbol among teens, young adults, and a certain subset of dewy skin-fluencers. Along with the Flip 4, above, Langu\u00e9 and Mileaf-Patel share an affection for Glossier products. Mileaf-Patel says that \u201cseeing a package from Glossier on my porch would make me so happy.\u201d Langu\u00e9 describes her \u201cLOVE\u201d for the Glossier gift set \u2014 which includes a Milk Jelly Cleanser, a Priming Moisturizer, and the status-y Balm Dotcom \u2014 in all caps, calling it a \u201cgreat starter set for someone wanting to dabble in skincare.\u201d Glossier sets also come as trios of Balm Dotcom, or a combo pack with Boy Brow and Lash Slick. If you\u2019re giving a gift to someone who already has a medicine cabinet full of Glossier products, Stanford University senior Amanda Kim Mai Tu suggests Glossier You perfume. \u201cI\u2019m finally trying to ditch the same Victoria\u2019s Secret body spray I\u2019ve used since high school, and a lot of friends have recommend the Glossier You perfume.\u201d Tu\u2019s friends say the scent is \u201csubtle and compatible with a variety of body chemistries,\u201d so it would be a great universal gift. $40 at Glossier Buy\n\nBest status water bottles to give to college students\n\nThere are a surprising number of trendy water bottles to choose from in 2019. But our polls of college students and RAs found that the insulated wide mouth Hydro-flask is king. Tang told writer Karen Iorio Adelson that she has noticed more and more Hydro Flask bottles around campus: \u201cPeople like them because they can hold more water than S\u2019well. Also, they\u2019re just trendy now.\u201d For another option, Tu and Chloe Kazuko Boehm, who just graduated from Tufts, recommend the insulated and Strategist-approved Zojirushi. According to Boehm, it \u201cliterally keeps drinks hot for days.\u201d\n\nBest status dorm appliance to give to college students\n\nWhirlpool 3.1 cu ft Mini Refrigerator Stainless Steel $140 (was $180, now 22% off) When we polled more than 30 college students, recent grads, and RAs to find out exactly what first-year college students should bring with them to school, a mini fridge was the most covetable item of all the recommendations (which included string lights, mattress pads, and extra seating, to name a few). Having one \u2014 especially one with a built-in freezer \u2014 seemed to be the holy grail of dorm goals. Justin Feliciano, an RA at the University of Connecticut, recommends this Whirlpool style, which he\u2019s still using after three years. He likes it for its \u201cfreezer component, storage drawers for produce and dairy, and adjustable knob to change how cold the fridge gets.\u201d $140 at Target Buy\n\nBest all-weather shoes to give to college students\n\nMileaf-Patel, Julie Schwartzberg, a student at Brooklyn\u2019s Pratt Institute, and John Grund, a junior at the Savannah College of Art and Design, all cited Chelsea-style Dr. Martens boots as must-have footwear. \u201cI want to get some new boots that are more sophisticated than the beat-up ones I have now,\u201d Grund says. Mileaf-Patel likes them so much that she \u201cwore them to death.\u201d Escoffier also likes Chelsea boots, but he prefers Blundstones for their unmatched durability and because they\u2019ll probably last you all four years in school.\n\nPlus some cozy socks to wear with them\n\nBest gifts if you were considering giving a sweater\n\nSweaters are almost a great gift, but the students we consulted would prefer a fleece. Mileaf-Patel calls her fleece, \u201ctruly my favorite piece of clothing.\u201d She likes fleece because it\u2019s both comfortable and very on-trend. \u201cI used to intern for Sandy Liang, who makes the coolest ones IMO,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they are definitely a splurge. I\u2019m waiting for it to get cold so I can wear mine.\u201d Langu\u00e9\u2019s favorite fleeces come from Aim\u00e9 Leon Dor\u00e9; they\u2019re less expensive than a Sandy Liang fleece, but will still cost you upward of a couple hundred dollars. If you\u2019re looking to spend less, Escoffier has a more budget-friendly recommendation: Uniqlo. In order to survive the brazen cold at British universities, you need something \u201coversize and fluffy,\u201d he says. He likes this Uniqlo fleece jacket because it\u2019s \u201ceasy on the eyes and the pocket.\u201d\n\nMost practical stocking stuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nAnker PowerLine+ Lightning Cable (10ft) Charging Cable According to Tu, an extra-long power cord is a godsend to anyone living in a dorm. Where she lives, the \u201coutlet-deficiency problem is very real,\u201d she says. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest multi-purpose gift for college students\n\nRavPower AC Outlet Built in 3-Prong Power Bank Laptop Travel Charger \u201cThere are so many times I\u2019ve needed to get home or call an Uber but couldn\u2019t because my phone died,\u201d says Rebecca Lee, a junior at Brown. \u201cStudying abroad in a new country has only exacerbated that need.\u201d Which is why she wants a portable charger. Tu recommends the RavPower because it can also charge a laptop. \u201cI\u2019ve been caught so many times in class or meetings with a dying laptop and nowhere to charge, desperately wishing I owned one of these.\u201d $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest gift for college-age photo and video enthusiasts\n\nSony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 V 20.1 MP Digital Camera $808 (was $998, now 19% off) If you\u2019re willing to splurge, buying a quality camera that isn\u2019t attached to a smartphone would wow any college student who\u2019s interested in photography or video. \u201cI love making videos, so having something smaller and easier to transport would be awesome,\u201d says Howard Lin, a recent graduate of the University of Florida. \u201cMy dream would be the Sony Alpha A9, but it costs quite a bit\u201d \u2014 as in, more than $3,000. So instead, he says he would be happy to settle for the RX100. $808 at Amazon Buy $808 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest (less expensive) gift for trendy photo college kids\n\nFujifilm QuickSnap Flash 400 Disposable 35mm Camera Maybe you want to encourage a love of photography without spending quite so much money. In that case, Mileaf-Patel recommends a film camera. \u201cThere\u2019s something more satisfying about having film developed,\u201d she says. Lo-fi disposable cameras like this Fujifilm camera are experiencing a resurgence in popularity. Mileaf-Patel suggests giving \u201ca bunch of them.\u201d $36 for 2 at Amazon Buy $36 for 2 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest entertainment gift for college students\n\nMiroir HD Mini Tilt Projector Eight students told us they either have a projector, know friends with a projector, or wish they owned one. As Caroline Tien, a senior at Haverford, says, \u201cyou can\u2019t go wrong.\u201d Having one will score you major cool points, whether you\u2019re hosting bigger groups or just your new best friend. This model comes recommended by Meg Schwieterman, a sophomore at the University of South Carolina, who has a simple set of instructions for using it: \u201cTack a sheet up on the wall, make a batch of microwave popcorn, and host a movie night!\u201d $300 at Amazon Buy $300 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest time-saving gift for college students\n\nHP OfficeJet Pro 6978 All-in-One Wireless Printer Tu told us that \u201cuniversity printing has finally worn on my last nerve, and I don\u2019t want to squander the rest of my senior year waiting for the old dorm desktops to load,\u201d so she\u2019s hoping for a basic compact printer. This HP OfficeJet printer would be a great gift for any college student, she says, \u201cand their friends would get a lot of mileage out of it as well.\u201d $90 at Amazon Buy $90 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest planet-saving gift for college students\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of the vendor Standard Baggu Set of 3 Also on Tu\u2019s wishlist, but perhaps more appropriate for her stocking, is this set of reusable Baggu tote bags. She calls them \u201cmy number-one, college-student gift recommendation,\u201d saying \u201cthese have SAVED ME so many times. I use them at the grocery store and hang one bag off each of my bike handlebars \u2014 there\u2019s no other way I could get everything home myself.\u201d Tu also told us that her sister just started college this year and has to carry her laundry across the street to wash it, so she\u2019ll probably be getting her one of the Big Baggus for the holidays to help. $36 at Baggu Buy\n\nBest problem-solving gift for college students\n\nVictorinox Swiss Army SwissChamp Pocket Knife Instead of a bulky toolbox, give a pocket knife. \u201cIf I had to be specific, I would choose the SwissChamp in hardwood,\u201d says Justin Lee, a senior at Brown University. \u201cI feel like there will inevitably come a time when having a multipurpose tool like this would come in handy, especially when traveling.\u201d $105 at Amazon Buy $105 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest red Solo cup alternative to give to college students\n\nBormioli Rocco Bodega Tumbler Mini Glasses, 7.5 Ounce, Set of 12 $20 (was $24, now 17% off) \u201cWedding registry\u2013type things make sense,\u201d says Cassidy Olsen, a soon-to-be graduate of Tufts. \u201cA lot of us are moving into places for the first time permanently. I know nothing about glassware, so I couldn\u2019t say what glassware, but a combo of drinking glasses and wine glasses would be good.\u201d Tu agrees that nice but not too expensive glassware makes a great gift. She says stemless glasses like the Bormioli Rocco Bodega tumblers are \u201ceasy to clean and store, and one step up from Solo cups.\u201d We here at the Strategist love the Bormioli Rocco Bodega short tumblers, which do double duty as wine glasses and drinkware. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest mood-setting (and odor-reducing) gift for college kids\n\nBoy Smells 8.8 oz Candle \u2014 Gardener Though some dorms won\u2019t allow them, fancy scented candles are a top gift idea among college students. Eight of the college students we talked to for our piece about stylish dorm accents said that scented candles are essential to creating an inviting atmosphere. UPenn graduate Shiv-Louis van de Ven and Mileaf-Patel also point out that scented candles cover up unpleasant smells. Mileaf-Patel says she\u2019d like to receive anything from Boy Smells, or any other \u201cfancier-than-what-you\u2019d-just-pick-up-at-the-store brand candles.\u201d $36 at Amazon Buy $36 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest gift to protect college students\u2019 feet from dirty floors\n\nUniqlo Flannel Slippers We all understand the importance of a good pair of shower shoes, even if we\u2019ve never lived in a dorm. But Escoffier makes the case for slippers as another way to protect your feet from scummy dorm floors because, according to him, \u201cno one knows how to clean a floor.\u201d $15 at Uniqlo Buy\n\nBest gift for keeping college students\u2019 floors clean\n\niRobot Roomba 675 Robot Vacuum-Wi-Fi Connectivity As if to confirm Escoffier\u2019s claim that college students need help keeping their floors clean, Langu\u00e9 admits that she hates cleaning her floors, but for a different reason: \u201cThis sounds so stupid, but I hate cleaning my floor because of how obsessive I get about it. Can someone get me a Roomba? PLEASE!\u201d $270 at Amazon Buy $270 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
