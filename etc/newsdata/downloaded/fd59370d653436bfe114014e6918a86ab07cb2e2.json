What's interesting, however, is the fact that there is no maximum limit in the bounty payout.\n\nThe post further added, \"As always, we will issue rewards based on the impact of each valid report and other factors indicated within our terms, with a minimum reward of $500.\"\n\nReuters\n\nApart from this, Facebook has also stated that it'll offer bonuses starting at $1000 going all the way up to $15,000 for bugs or flaws found in the native apps. This sum will be added to the final bounty payout.\n\nReports in the past have revealed that the maximum bounty Facebook has offered for a particular bug is $50,000. Google too had raised its bounty payout doubling its maximum payout from $15,000 to $30,000. Apple on the other hand also has its bug bounty program where it has offered a maximum bounty payout of $1 million.", "description": "Facebook has decided to pay more bounty for bugs or flaws discovered by hackers on its platform with a view to making its apps and services more secure for users.
