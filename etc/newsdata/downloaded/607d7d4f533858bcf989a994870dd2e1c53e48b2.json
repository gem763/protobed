Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\u201d\n\nAlso that day, he mentioned Alabama in a briefing on Dorian. \u201cIt may get a little piece of a great place: It\u2019s called Alabama,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be. This just came up, unfortunately.\u201c\n\nBirmingham\u2019s branch of the National Weather Service quickly rushed to correct the record, clarifying in a tweet 20 minutes after Trump's original that \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian,\u201d because the system would remain too far east.\n\nConfronted by reporters on Wednesday about the apparent Sharpie edit, the president employed a common dodge: \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he quickly told reporters three times.\n\nHe first insisted the White House would be issuing \u201ca better map.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought it would get it, as a piece of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have a better map than that which is going to be presented where we had many lines going directly, many models \u2014 each line being a model \u2014 and they were going directly through. And in all cases Alabama was hit, if not likely, in some cases pretty hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a different route,\u201d the president continued, adding falsely that \u201cthey actually gave that a 95 percent chance probability. It turned out that was not what happened. It made the right turn up the coast, but Alabama was hit very hard \u2014 was going to be hit very hard.\u201d\n\nSharpie-gate may have run afoul of the law, which calls for either a fine, no more than 90 days in jail \u2014 or both \u2014 for \u201cwhoever knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau, United States Signal Service, or other branch of the Government service.\u201d\n\nTrump also defended his Twitter forecasting earlier in the week, decrying a report from ABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl and claiming that \"under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some 'hurt.'\"\n\nIn response to Sharpie-gate blowing up on social media Wednesday, the Trump campaign\u2018s rapid-response team pointed to a Facebook post Thursday by the National Weather Service in Birmingham, warning that \"it is too soon to say with much confidence if (or how much) Dorian\" would impact on the state.\n\nBut the modification took off, making Sharpie and Sharpiegate trend on Twitter, with users sharing their own Sharpie'd takes on the Trump presidency.\n\nTrump weighed in on the melee for the third time Wednesday with an evening tweet, posting a photo of what he said were early models of the storm's possible paths dated Aug. 28. \"As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama,\" he said, referring to a handful of possible paths that showed the storm making landfall in the U.S. as far west as Louisiana.\n\n\"I accept the Fake News apologies!\" he added.", "description": "The perpetrator may have committed a crime with the suspicious Sharpie marking. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the president said repeatedly when confronted.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_eQSMuARMptQKuy1upzu5g--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/e4b90dedb5a79be02c0eb6049e1c2998", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
