Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\n\nSick on the couch and in need of a cough drop? The kids are home from school, and you've run out of gummy bears and Goldfish crackers?\n\nWalgreens customers in Virginia will now be able to get those items, and many more, dropped at their doorstep \u2013 by drone.\n\nThe retailer is the first in the nation to deliver purchases on-demand by drone in a pilot program debuting in the city of Christiansburg.\n\nGM strike winds on: 'Truly saved my life': GM workers on strike fight for benefits as automaker's profits soar\n\nInterest rates get a trim: Another cut? Fed looks ready to lower interest rates again as the economy faces risks\n\nIn a partnership with dronemaking company Wing, Walgreens will let customers tap the Wing app and get individual items, such as aspirin or tissues, or choose among six packs containing items for allergies, first aid and other needs. A drone will be dispatched to pick up the items, then travel to the customer's home, delivering the purchases within minutes.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about the partnership and the future of drone delivery,\u2019\u2019 said Vish Sankaran, chief innovation officer for Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nChristiansburg was chosen because it is near Virginia Tech, which has collaborated with Wing for three years through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Integration Pilot Program.\n\nWalgreens will pilot drone delivery in Christiansburg, Va., starting in October (Photo: Walgreens/Wing)\n\nChristiansburg residents who want to take part in the pilot can go to wing.com/Virginia for additional information, and Walgreens and Wing will spread the word by demonstrating the service and through other communication venues.\n\nThe drone can cover a distance of six miles each way. Walgreens will not be the only retailer whose goods are part of the pilot. Customers will be able to get birthday cards, small gifts and even ice cream from Sugar Magnolia, a regional company.\n\nWing is teaming up with FedEx to offer drone delivery of packages in certain parts of Christiansburg.\n\n\u201cThis trial is intended to demonstrate the benefits of drone delivery by improving access to health care products, creating new avenues of growth for local businesses and exploring ways to enhance last-mile delivery service,\u2019\u2019 Wing CEO James Burgess said.\n\nFollow Charisse Jones on Twitter @charissejones\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/09/19/walgreens-deliver-aspirin-snacks-drone-starting-nextt-month/2374941001/", "description": "Walgreens customers in\u00a0Virginia will be able to get those items, and many more,\u00a0dropped at their doorstep by drone.", "authors": ["Charisse Jones", "Published P.M.
