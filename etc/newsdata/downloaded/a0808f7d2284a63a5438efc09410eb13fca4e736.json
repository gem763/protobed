The import facility has been operating since 2008.\n\n* One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.\n\n* In addition to Costa Azul phase 1, Sempra is also developing a second phase at Costa Azul, the Port Arthur LNG export terminal in Texas and two phases at the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana.\n\n(Reporting by Scott DiSavino Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "description": "* Previously, the company, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy, had said it planned to make a FID in late 2019.  * Tania Ortiz Mena Lopez Negrete, IENOVA's CEO, told analysts in an earnings call on Thursday that the company was running the engineering, procurement and construction (", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
