He promised to bring millions of manufacturing jobs offshored to China back to the United States, and stop China from cheating in ways that harm American businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s not going well. Trump\u2019s main lever has been tariffs on Chinese imports, which have the unfortunate side effect of raising costs on American businesses and consumers. The tariffs have cut into demand for Chinese imports and hurt the Chinese economy. But they\u2019re also hurting the U.S. manufacturing sector, which is now contracting, and depressing business investment. China, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t blinked.\n\nThere are better ways to confront China over legitimate trade abuses. Instead of fighting similar battles trade against allies in Europe and elsewhere, as Trump is doing, the United States should team up with them and fight China as a giant bloc of nations with aligned interests. The United States should demand reforms at the World Trade Organization, which is not properly equipped to police China. A trade pact such as the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump pulled the United States out of, would actually put pressure on China to change. And none of these things requires the United States to punish itself first with tariffs, in order to punish China.\n\nAll of the Democrats in the Sept. 12 debate had a chance to offer better ideas on trade. Virtually all of them failed. Sure, they bashed Trump on trade, but they offered no meaningful alternatives. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\nElizabeth Warren: \u201cOur trade policy works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else.\u201d Whoops, she left out the 200 million-plus consumers who get cheaper stuff and the 401(k) holders who own stock in those giant corporations. And her big improvement would be to include union representatives in trade negotiations.\n\nAmy Klobuchar: \u201cWe need to go back to the negotiating table\u2014that\u2019s what I would do.\u201d An excellent way of saying nothing at all.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

She did, however, use trade as her opening to make the cheeky \u201creally small dude\u201d crack about Trump.\n\nBernie Sanders: \u201cWhat we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the famers in the Midwest and elsewhere.\u201d He\u2019ll get back to us when he figures out what that is.\n\nJulian Castro: \u201cWe have millions of Uighurs in China that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated.\u201d Millions of Americans are now Googling \u201cUighurs.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden came close. He closed his remarks on trade by saying, \u201cYou need to organize the world to take on China, to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.\u201d He didn\u2019t explain how, but foreign policy is a Biden strength, and one can imagine that if he were president, he\u2019d know whom to ask to develop a coherent China policy.\n\nTrade is normally a sleeper issue in political campaigns. But Trump used free trade as one of his bogeymen for what ails working-class voters in 2016, and it worked. Trade may be even more important in this election, because Trump has imposed trade policies that might lead to success, but seem more likely to backfire and perhaps even cause a recession.\n\nChina surely cares who wins the 2020 election. An emboldened Trump in his second term would face fewer constraints and possibly hit China even harder. What a Democratic president would do, we don\u2019t really know. By the time of the next debate, in October, they should tell us.\n\nRick Newman is the author of four books, including \u201cRebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.\u201d Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.
