Forward-looking statements are based on the company\u2019s current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to, the following: a downturn in economic environment and client spending budgets; the company\u2019s failure to meet growth and productivity objectives; a failure of the company\u2019s innovation initiatives; damage to the company\u2019s reputation; risks from investing in growth opportunities; failure of the company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio to prevent competitive offerings and the failure of the company to obtain necessary licenses; cybersecurity and data privacy considerations; fluctuations in financial results, impact of local legal, economic, political and health conditions; adverse effects from environmental matters, tax matters and the company\u2019s pension plans; ineffective internal controls; the company\u2019s use of accounting estimates; the company\u2019s ability to attract and retain key employees and its reliance on critical skills; impacts of relationships with critical suppliers; product quality issues; impacts of business with government clients; currency fluctuations and customer financing risks; impact of changes in market liquidity conditions and customer credit risk on receivables; reliance on third party distribution channels and ecosystems; the company\u2019s ability to successfully manage acquisitions, alliances and dispositions, including integration challenges, failure to achieve objectives, the assumption of liabilities, and higher debt levels; legal proceedings and investigatory risks; risk factors related to IBM securities; and other risks, uncertainties and factors discussed in the company\u2019s Form 10\u2011Qs, Form 10\u2011K and in the company\u2019s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or in materials incorporated therein by reference. Any forward-looking statement in this release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n\nPresentation of Information in this Press Release\n\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company\u2019s results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the company has also disclosed in this press release the following non-GAAP information, which management believes provides useful information to investors:\n\nIBM results \u2014\n\nadjusting for currency (i.e., at constant currency);\n\ntotal revenue and cloud revenue adjusting for divested businesses and currency;\n\nrevenue for Red Hat normalized for historical comparability;\n\npresenting operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share amounts and related income statement items;\n\nadjusting for free cash flow;\n\nnet cash from operating activities, excluding Global Financing receivables.\n\nFree cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash outflows. The company views Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, which it seeks to maximize and therefore it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, the company does not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.\n\nThe rationale for management\u2019s use of these non-GAAP measures is included in Exhibit 99.2 in the Form 8\u2011K that includes this press release and is being submitted today to the SEC.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nIBM\u2019s regular quarterly earnings conference call is scheduled to begin at 5:00 p.m. EDT, today. The Webcast may be accessed via a link at http://www.ibm.com/investor/events/earnings/3q19.html. Presentation charts will be available shortly before the Webcast.\n\nFinancial Results Below (certain amounts may not add due to use of rounded numbers; percentages presented are calculated from the
