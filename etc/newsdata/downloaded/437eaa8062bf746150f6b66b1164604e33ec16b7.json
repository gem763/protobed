They play especially tough at home, Julio Jones is banged up with a foot injury, and quarterback is extremely deep, so you can do better than Ryan in Week 1.\n\nWashington Redskins @ Philadelphia Eagles\n\nStart: Chris Thompson, Jordan Howard\n\nThe easy answer is to sit all Washington players in this overwhelming matchup in which they\u2019ll be missing Trent Williams, but if you\u2019re looking for a PPR sleeper or cheap DFS option, take a flier on Thompson, who could be plenty busy in the passing game given the likely game script and dearth of alternatives on offense (Adrian Peterson might even be a healthy scratch). Philadelphia yielded the second-most catches to running backs last season.\n\nThe Eagles are near double-digit home favorites, have a sizable advantage up front and will likely be protecting a lead throughout the second half. Miles Sanders has more long-term upside, but this is a committee right now, and Howard is going to play as arguably the league\u2019s top blocking back in the NFL. The favorite for goal-line work, Howard should hit pay dirt Sunday, so treat him as a top-20 RB option in Week 1.\n\nBuffalo Bills @ New York Jets\n\nSit: Devin Singletary, Robby Anderson\n\nStory continues\n\nSingletary is the heavy favorite to lead Buffalo\u2019s backfield in touches this season, but he\u2019s currently splitting time with both T.J. Yeldon and Frank Gore (who somehow averaged 4.6 YPC as a 35 year old running behind Miami\u2019s offensive line last season). The rookie gets a tough first test on the road against a defense that added Quinnen Williams in the draft.\n\nAnderson appears over his calf injury, and he\u2019ll be a buy-low target after this week with a bright longterm outlook, but you\u2019ll want him benched Sunday when he\u2019ll be shadowed by Tre\u2019Davious White. The Bills ceded the fewest fantasy points to outside receivers last season, and Adam Gase\u2019s offenses have finished last in plays per game two of the past three years.\n\nBaltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins\n\nStart: Mark Ingram, Albert Wilson\n\nRecent reports of a committee in Baltimore\u2019s backfield wasn\u2019t ideal news for those rostering Ingram, but there are going to be a ton of touches to go around, and Week 1 presents a Dolphins front-seven that was bottom-five in points allowed to running backs last year. The Ravens have a fast-paced system, so Miami\u2019s defense is going to be exhausted in Sunday\u2019s heat.\n\nWilson is going to play the slot a lot more this season \u2014 an area where he\u2019s thrived when previously given the chance \u2014 and also Baltimore\u2019s most vulnerable on defense. Kenny Stills is gone, and no QB targets the slot more than Ryan Fitzpatrick, so Wilson is an intriguing sleeper (both this week and for the season).\n\nKansas City Chiefs @ Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nSit: Sammy Watkins\n\nStart: Leonard Fournette in DFS\n\nOver six road games last season, Watkins totaled 17 catches for 205 yards without a touchdown, and this week he\u2019ll be facing A.J. Bouye and company, who yielded the fewest fantasy points to wideouts in 2018. You\u2019ll want Watkins firmly on the bench Sunday.\n\nI\u2019m not optimistic Fournette stays healthy all season, but he\u2019s looking at a big workload in Week 1 entering fresh, with little competition in the backfield and against a Kansas City team that had a historically bad run defense DVOA last season. The Chiefs\u2019 fast pace should lead to more plays too, and the addition by subtraction of Blake Bortles should drastically help Jacksonville.\n\nTennessee Titans @ Cleveland Browns\n\nSit: Corey Davis\n\nStart: Rashard Higgins\n\nDavis will be dealing with Denzel Ward and a strong Cleveland secondary, shaky QB play and likely less volume with Adam Humphries, A.J. Brown and Delanie Walker now around.\n\nCleveland\u2019s new No. 3 receiver gets Malcolm Butler and a highly favorable first matchup, and it sets up well even further with Odell Beckham Jr. banged up (hip), and David Njoku facing a Tennessee D that locked down tight ends last season. Higgins is a sleeper and a cheap DFS option this week.\n\nLos Angeles Rams @ Carolina Panthers\n\nStart: Jared Goff, Curtis Samuel\n\nGoff had massive home/road splits last season, but he played better on the road the year before, and Sunday\u2019s game should be a high-scoring affair versus a Carolina defense that\u2019s far more beatable through the air than on the ground. The Panthers\u2019 offense should put up points, while the Rams\u2019 run game may not be as strong with a compromised Todd Gurley. The passing attack also gets Cooper Kupp back, so Goff is a top-10 option in Week 1.\n\nJared Goff is an excellent Week 1 QB play. (Photo by Harry How/Getty Images)\n\nThe Rams have a strong secondary, but Samuel looks ready to bust out this season, and Carolina will move him all over the field and get him touches in what should be a high-scoring game Sunday.\n\nCincinnati Bengals @ Seattle Seahawks\n\nStart: Tyler Boyd, Rashaad Penny\n\nThis is a tough matchup in Seattle, but Boyd is going to be plenty busy with A.J. Green sidelined, and assuming he continues to work frequently out of the slot, he\u2019ll get the soft part of Seattle\u2019s secondary in rookie corner Ugo Amadi.\n\nThe Bengals allowed the second-most fantasy points to running backs and ranked 26th in rush defense DVOA last season, and they are nearly double-digit underdogs on the road Sunday. Chris Carson is a borderline top-five RB in Week 1, while Penny is a fine flex option.\n\nIndianapolis Colts @ Los Angeles Chargers\n\nSit: T.Y. Hilton, Austin Ekeler\n\nHilton gets the obvious downgrade with the loss of Andrew Luck and a difficult Week 1 assignment against shadow corner Casey Hayward, and his production historically drops off in a big way when playing outdoors, so he\u2019s someone to consider fading this week.\n\nEkeler proved he worked much better as a change-of-pace back than a featured one when given the starting opportunity last season, and he\u2019ll be dealing with a poor Los Angeles offensive line up against a Colts run defense that ranked No. 4 in DVOA last season.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nStart: Marquise Goodwin, Chris Godwin in DFS\n\nA fantasy bust last year, Goodwin has earned a starting role to open this season and gets a highly enticing matchup right away against a Bucs secondary that was sliced for 8.2 YPA and a league-worst 110.0 Passer Rating last season. It\u2019s an advantageous matchup for one of the league\u2019s fastest players.\n\nGodwin was a popular breakout pick, and he\u2019s primed for a fast start in a potentially high-scoring game while facing a San Francisco secondary that was gashed for the most fantasy points by the slot position last season, and could be missing an always-injured Jimmie Ward on Sunday. Godwin\u2019s a WR1 with a DFS price that doesn\u2019t match.\n\nDetroit Lions @ Arizona Cardinals\n\nStart: Kerryon Johnson in DFS\n\nSit: David Johnson in DFS\n\nWhile Detroit\u2019s receivers are enticing with Arizona\u2019s secondary so untested and without a suspended Patrick Peterson, the Cardinals\u2019 front seven allowed the most fantasy points to running backs last year, and Johnson should be busy with Theo Riddick gone. The Lions\u2019 slow pace should be offset by the Cardinals running plays quickly.\n\nWe have no clue what to expect from the Air Raid, and it\u2019s safe to expect a learning curve with the young offense (although the element of surprise could help). Johnson hasn\u2019t truly helped fantasy teams since 2016 (and his metrics were miserable last season on an individual level). He gets a Detroit run defense that went from bad (139.3 rushing ypg) to dominant (56.0 ypg) immediately after trading for Damon Harrison last season. DJ\u2019s offensive line is a major issue as well.\n\nNew York Giants @ Dallas Cowboys\n\nStart: Evan Engram, Michael Gallup\n\nOdell Beckham Jr. is out of town and Golden Tate is suspended, so Engram should see good volume, especially with New York entering as TD underdogs. Dallas had the No. 5 run defense DVOA last year while struggling to cover tight ends, so the setup is favorable.\n\nAmari Cooper is dealing with a foot injury and is scheduled to be shadowed by Janoris Jenkins on Sunday, while Ezekiel Elliott is slated to be on a snap count coming off his holdout. Enter Gallup, who looks ready to make the leap in Year Two and will face rookie corner Deandre Baker, so his arrow is pointing up.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers @ New England Patriots\n\nSit: Donte Moncrief\n\nStart: Julian Edelman\n\nStay bullish on Moncrief moving forward, but Week 1 is a tough start against an improved New England defense that allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to outside receivers last season. Moncrief\u2019s Sunday night is going to feature a lot of Stephon Gilmore, who\u2019s one of the league\u2019s best corners.\n\nEdelman no longer possesses the most upside among receivers on his own team with Josh Gordon\u2019s return, but he gets the more favorable matchup in Week 1, as the Steelers allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to the slot last season. Pittsburgh defends the run well, yet the Patriots have one of the highest implied totals this week, so it\u2019s a clean setup for Edelman.\n\nHouston Texans @ New Orleans Saints\n\nStart: Will Fuller, Jared Cook in DFS\n\nFuller routinely puts up WR1 stats when healthy (he has 11 touchdown grabs in 11 career games with Deshaun Watson) and gets a prime matchup against Eli Apple and company, who allowed the most fantasy points to outside receivers last season. Last year, Fuller produced the second-best Passer Rating when targeted, committed zero drops, finished third in yards per target (11.2) and was top-10 in fantasy points per target as well as fantasy points per route run, and he appears fully recovered from knee surgery. Indoors and with the week\u2019s highest total (53), expect Fuller to benefit from a high-scoring affair Monday night. He\u2019s a top-10 WR on my board this week.\n\nThe Saints have the highest implied team total in Week 1, and they face a Houston team that\u2019s uptempo on offense, defends receivers well and possesses last season\u2019s top-ranked run defense DVOA. Moreover, the Texans allowed the second-most fantasy points to tight ends last year, so the setup sure looks mouth-watering for newcomer Cook on Monday night. He\u2019s a top-three TE on my board in Week 1.\n\nDenver Broncos @ Oakland Raiders\n\nStart: DaeSean Hamilton\n\nSit: Antonio Brown\n\nAssuming Hamilton plays mostly the slot and the recovered Emmanuel Sanders moves outside, the matchup is favorable here, as Oakland\u2019s secondary is most vulnerable in the middle of the field (although Daryl Worley isn\u2019t a bad consolation prize if Hamilton plays more perimeter). Hamilton can overcome some shaky QB play with the help of an Oakland secondary that ranked last in pass defense DVOA last season.\n\nAfter looking like his contract would be voided in Oakland, an apology has given Brown a real chance at suiting up for MNF, but it\u2019s clear this is the riskiest player to have in fantasy football right now. It\u2019s not a great matchup to begin with, and Brown barely practiced with his new team all summer. Consider this a fade in general on him this season, as it\u2019s become an increasing long shot the AB era ends well in Oakland.\n\nFollow the Yahoo fantasy football crew on Twitter: Andy Behrens, Dalton Del Don, Brad Evans, Matt Harmon, Liz Loza, Scott Pianowski and Tank Williams\n\nListen to the Yahoo Fantasy Football Podcast", "description": "Dalton Del Don delivers his sit/start advice ahead of Week 1, and even though Antonio Brown seems ready to suit up on Monday, he doesn't like the WR's outlook.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pie_h9D7K8taw8UsSvivsA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04ODUuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/za.0VtiKa4qqdMIT2ACnTg--~B/aD0zMTI2O3c9NDUxODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/0f6e8eb0-d0e6-11e9-bfbc-805a1742ea50", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
